and our friends in the back god bless you it's good to have you here with us this morning amen we're just kind of old-fashioned but don't we love the lord amen so i was thinking about that comment i said we should sing i like the old time way uh i like the old time singing shouting [Music] i like the old time i like the old time singing shouting preaching praying i like the old time way i'll i like the old [Music] i like the old times preaching and praying i like the old-time way well i'll sing about my savior everywhere i go [Music] say amen amen praise god well let's get ready to turn the service to our pastor to brother paul i said we went home and studied and uh number 407 and we changed the key so we all can sing it in christ alone so i know he's been wanting to say we've always just sing the course we figured out what he would probably serve as best if it's still a little too high for you just open your mouth and pretend [Music] but uh it's a beautiful and i agree with our pastor the verse the verses are just beautiful let's sing this as we get ready to receive him in christ alone will i glory for i could pride myself in battles one for i've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone i'll overcome oh i could stop and successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies could not equal to the grace by which i stand in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in everything torrey let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is christ alone [Music] in christ alone do i glory for only by his grace i am redeemed for only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my knees and now i seek no greater honor in just to know him more and to count my gains but losses to the glory of my lord in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross my source of strength my source of hope is christ the lord oh in crime let's say christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is can we say amen to that amen hallelujah we have no other place of refuge amen no other no other hope you know we look and it's interesting just the nature of man i was looking a little article and uh these scientists are just sure that uh there's got to be life somewhere else you know out in the universe and i'm thankful today that we can say here today and say the life we're searching for is right here in jesus christ we don't have to go find some other place and amen god bless you to our visitors today amen as as christians as believers there's never a visitor in the body of christ we're we're all one amen happy father's day god bless you my brothers uh just the very plan of god this deceit and uh you know as i was studying this out i thought you know it it doesn't matter you know you say father's day so it's only for fathers but you know god's grace every young man uh every everyone is being trained up into that position amen and we look for that quite a few not here today so we just want to remember each and every one of them in prayer brother isaac and sister kristen if you'll it all worked out well no one was hurt but on their way to church this morning a young lady pulled out in front of them and they were in an accident so um uh poor little girl she was following uh her her father and her father turned in there at the lake and she didn't even look she just turned in behind him and just drove right in front of them and poor little girl her hearts broke her first car and now it's dinged we all know what that feels like right you know so anyway just remember them so hallelujah um brother rich sends his greetings uh you know uh uh brother chris come to me with the um uh thought or something burden that was on his heart you know for the uh the coming uh church weekend camping trip um and as far as i know brother rich is on board right to that i hadn't heard any different and so we just definitely want to be praying for brother rich sister charity and the family look forward to all that can make it up there and i know some will be saying well we don't have a camper we don't have a tent we're not camping out folks but it's not such a bad drive and i just want you to think about it maybe you know if you can't make it otherwise just get up a little bit earlier sunday morning and drive up to the mountains and have church with with everyone amen let's just uh let's just stand as it would be i want to speak to you this morning amen uh once again in redemption's manifestation uh this whole plan of redemption my brother and sister is being played out in front of the whole world and you know increasingly as i i just look and study and follow these things we we're seeing the numbers climbing of young people and not just young people but more so in young people they're not even sure that there is a god there's been no foundation laid in their life that god is real that god is present and and so they've come to a stage now it's obviously uh being taught in in our uh our schools in higher education uh and uh so it's creating an atmosphere where in times of need people they have nowhere to reach out to they they feel uh more and more isolated just reading an article this was done uh you know psychology the science of the mind uh you know is interesting because the scripture and now i'm not doing away with the need for those things but the scripture says that we would find the mind of christ and so as we look in a world that's becoming increasingly caught up and and we're searching for answers a psychologist telling you you know this childhood memory this thing here this thing here this is what is causing this in your life but we serve a savior right we serve a god who said you know what i can come along and i can take away the pain of the past i can take away the hurts the sorrows i can take away the sin and and uh increasingly as people say well there is no god increasingly they're stepping away from this whole world that we have to just put it before the lord and trust him to let it go to let him do the work in our life and and so we're finding what is happening in the day is people have no release and the pressure is is building up you know and now i'm certainly believe in law and order i have many friends that are in law enforcement so i don't want this sound derogatory but when the pressure gets great that the police are starting to be the culprits in road rage we are over pressurized as a people and uh and so we're seeing that because no one's exempt and um so we're here in this day and and we're looking for what god would do and and uh we're seeing the signs of manifestation we're seeing judgment come on the earth and not making light of no one but my brother and sisters certainly what man calls a solution is just dig the hole deeper and it's not a real solution so i want to you know on mother's day we we spoke on a mother's call to action and today i wanted to balance that with a father's call to action and uh we want to look in romans the fourth chapter and uh we will take from that lay little pattern here this morning by god's grace we can move through quickly i'll leave a little bit of the homework to you today to go back and read your scriptures and and study this out so what we have here in romans the fourth chapter is the new testament foundation laid out of what god did to and through abraham now remember abraham himself as abram was just a man and he had certain strengths he had certain weaknesses but god doesn't look and say i'm going to choose you to be a part of my body or a christian because you have this strength god chose you because he chose you that's all that comes down to it we didn't have to be able to say well i'm a christian because we're christian because god chose us because he said you are my son you are my daughter you are my family and so i think that we just have confidence in that and say you know what i'm here i want to serve the lord because he called me and by god's grace something in me responded to that call isn't that beautiful hallelujah oh good to see brother isaac i see him just step in the four year there so happy they're here today let's turn in our bibles romans 4 and 1 to start what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh right now paul is speaking to the romans he's a jew amen pertaining to the flesh hath found forth abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was countered unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believe us see god always puts a quantifier in there so it's not that we sit back and say you know what i don't believe in works i'm not gonna i'm just gonna sit back i'm gonna trust god but see you have to believe on him you have to have a faith in the work of god not in our own work so it's not that we just set back you know with our lemonade as it were we joke about sitting in the recliner with with our bunny slippers on and just say well if god wants it to happen it'll happen no sir my brother and sister you and i are called to fulfill our portion of the word of god but it won't be our works that does it because our works in jesus christ is actually our faith in his spoken word there's where our works is manifested so it's not how many tracks we hand out now you know there used to be a lady come by the house and and uh you know one day i kind of put a question to her i said so so tell me what what is this and she said well in our faith what we believe you know it's kind of uh credited to us by this work and so we we try to reach out as many people as we can with these tracks because it's and i'm like works and she goes well we don't view it as works then who's counting if it's not works we don't count we don't say i did this i did this i did this we simply look in the word of god and allow it to work through us now to him that worketh his reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin and i say truly blessed is that man heavenly father we just ask you lord jesus to come this morning lord this thought lord this little burden upon our heart we just ask you lord help us to express it that it might be a blessing to your people and encouragement lord as we press to the mark of the high calling lord we know that lord the life that we're living is your life lord we know that the works that we do are your works for father we simply lord are the ungodly and lord we have no ability within ourself but what you have placed there and lord i say this morning that gives us great ability because you are an awesome god a great god and father not weak lord but you have overcome all things and you have poured your very spirit your very mind into this body of believers lord that we can stand upon the word full of faith believing confessing and acting on the word of god that you might receive glory father ask you to be with those here this morning and lord those that are on vacation and traveling and family and whatever circumstance might be lord bless them all we ask and bless our visitors in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now i have quite lengthy scripture today and i hope you don't mind as we will look into that i just want to as i said speak to you on a father's call to action and to see how the foundation is laid god always gives us a godly example you know we are not my brother and sister as the scripture says there's nothing new under the sun so we are not treading uh on on a new gospel we are just coming and the gospel is being made applicable to the day that we live in now you know science says that there was great things happened in the days of the pyramids you know they keep saying that we don't have the technology in the day that we live in to to build the pyramids as they are built and so we look at that and realize the great things that are happening in the day that we live uh are not the greatest things that have ever happened man tends to think that we have reached a pinnacle but if we actually had reached a pinnacle then our nation would truly from top to bottom east to west would be entirely serving god we would not have uh the debauchery and all of the things that are in the world today on in our nation today if we had reached a pinnacle in fact i won't quote who this minister is you would probably recognize his name he said while man is touting his accomplishments god is looking at his failures and uh so we look at that and realize that in the failures of man what does it come down to well we know that the failures of man is our failure to be obedient to the word of god and when man is committed or completely subservient to god now god's not looking for people that serve him 50 of the time or 75 percent of the time or 80 or 90 or 99 god's looking for people that serve him 100 of the time and and so you know you look at that and i thank the lord as we look in the scripture today amen that uh you know we look here and realize that uh god does not impute sin to you and i and our iniquities are forgiven and our sins are covered and i i have to just say thank you lord for that because i know that while we can talk in a realm of uh we're all perfect and we're all whatever as far as i know we're all still human and so humans make mistakes but um thank the lord today for his grace and mercy that covers our mistakes amen i want to go on into verse 9 and and we'll finish up and go into our thought today cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith uh was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so when god was dealing with abraham it was not after his life was perfect god dealt with abraham in his base human nature his position and god says you know what i'm a great enough god and i know who you are amen can someone say amen this morning he knows who you are and god says i'll come and deal with you wherever because i truly know who you are not in the image we see ourself in the mirror in the morning but in the image that god looks at us and we know that god looks upon the hearts and so as we see our failures and we see our circumstance god looks beyond all of that and says i know who you are just as he looked at abraham and said abraham i know who you really are amen how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision no uncircumcision amen thank you lord and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe and isn't this beautiful how we can see the promise it was given in the old testament there in genesis how that he was promised to be the father and that his seed would be as seeds uh sands of the shore and and my brother and sister some people say well you know the world's not covered up as it were with millions of jews or but you see it moved from just a a lineage of a nation or a bloodline or a people and it moved into a spiritual realm of sons and daughters of god and so that he is now in the realm of faith amen in the realm of of uh coming into righteousness he is the father uh by faith of every believer on the face of the earth today and so it's there though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but also who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promised that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law i had a cousin many years ago i was very happy that she finally found her way from that mountain but she joined a group and the basic premise of this group was that to really follow god have to go back and we have to follow every law through the old testament and suddenly they were not wearing these clothes and not eating this and not doing this and not doing that and yet you know as i tried to speak to my cousin i did speak to her but to get her to see that we are not bound in the law the the scripture so plainly says jesus said this he goes uh i didn't come to do away with the law but i come to magnify the law and the law being magnified my brother and sister was not the law itself the purpose that god had for you and i and what he was doing was as the scripture also declares to us he was moving away now the ten commandments so i won't be mis understood this morning the ten commandments are just as applicable this morning as they ever were but it went away from something written as it were on tables of stone or written on a page and god said i'm going to write this on the tables of your heart and so we sit here today with this written on the table of our heart not that we have to pack around some kind of rule book but it becomes a very nature of the individual the believer when he sees the world in its condition and he recognizes that by the word of god he has been pulled or separated from that can someone say thank you lord for the separating of the word amen because otherwise we would be just caught up in the same religious spirits under the same thing basically just saying oh we believe jesus christ exists we believe in god so therefore we're christians my brother sister the word of god says we'll take on his nature we'll take on his mind that will have the very heart of god and when you think about that my brother and sister this is a side note you can study out you think about that now the word of god shows us how the very nature of god god's own heart and then he says david was a man after my own heart this was not something he was fond i you know i like his response in crisis i like his management his leadership abilities i like the way he dresses i like no my brother sister that's not what he's talking about he was talking a man who had been tapped into the very spirit of god and he got so into that now we can look at our bible and recognize david was not without failures david was not without mistakes david was not without things that we would look at and say that looks like sin to me but you see he had tapped into the very nature and he knew and god looked down and said david's heart longs and is like my heart oh god help us this morning to have that very nature and heart of almighty god amen to be able to tap into that and god then when david tapped into that he was able oh my goodness we look at bathsheba and we look at all of that look at a prophet coming to david and saying you know david there's this man and he has come and while he had many sheep he has desired and coveted and taken the sheep the only sheep of another man and david's heart didn't say oh my well that's life david's heart went that man deserves judgment that man tell me who he is and we'll meet out judgment to him and a prophet says david it's you and he doesn't say well i'm justified i'm the king he goes oh god forgive me you see there was the heart there's where he tapped into the very spirit of god it wasn't a defensive hey look i'm justified in doing this i'm the king i'm important i'm special i'm no it was there he recognized oh god forgive me this wasn't right but you see he got caught in the spirit of the day he got caught in the spirit of the occasion and bathsheba i don't think she probably was some ugly woman right so he got caught up let's just say it like it is in the lust of the flesh and he looked at her but when he realized how wrong he was his heart come out and said god forgive me lord help us to have that kind of heart help us lord to be able to stand on the word and when the word corrects us right now this is a little deviation more homework if you want to look it up amen the scripture says that the lord chastens those he loves he doesn't give any other reason he doesn't say i chasten those that go to church faithfully i chasten those who give a lot of tithe i chasten those that this and memorize and do all of these things he said i chasten those i love so what is it god pouring his own heart out to you and i and he comes and because he loves us and he's pouring his own heart into us his own nature his own spirit he says then i'm going to chasten you because i want you to line up i want you to be a part of my word i want you to be the picture perfect image of who i am see we can hold her hand up my brother and sister is this a picture-perfect image no it isn't but you see i hope this is something that resonates with you you can't just be following christ and be a picture perfect image you realize that i hope you i hope you see this you can't just follow christ and be a picture-perfect image it's only when you turn and have a face-to-face personal relationship with him that you then become the picture-perfect image of god but so many people say but i'm following i've been our family has been in this church and in this church in 40 years 50 years 75 years my brother and sister just following going to church isn't going to do it it's that face-to-face relationship that brings us into the perfect image of jesus christ and so we live in a world increasingly and yes this is kind of direct we can count numbers of which the scripture actually speaks again counting the numbers and we can boast of the numbers but are they just followers or have they had a relationship i tell you you take this back to the military i love to read military history a man was a navy seal and he made a statement give me seven men who are bonded together and we will accomplish more than 150 men that have no unity think about it seven holy ghost-filled people will do more than a whole church full of people who are there for a program or there because it's the social or it's there because of whatever and you look at this now i better get moving along here i mean it's father's day and we can't can't keep you all day right amen you know i have to be honest with you you know i am talking on the phone to a brother the other day and he goes man brother paul that was a really good service you preached but it was kind of long ah look you guys are supposed to have grace and mercy on me i can't help it i get excited about these things and there's more things to pile on the table imagine if i was the one doing the buffet and you didn't leave until you'd eaten every portion you might want to bring a pillow blanket with you amen so as we look at this let me just focus right here real quick for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law we'll never accomplish that through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect now you're probably wondering brother paul this doesn't sound like a father's day sermon well it really is my brother and sister because here he is abraham accounted to be the father of the nations god laying out this very foundation of faith and presenting it to the world through a man that he said would be a father of nations look at paul's account of abraham's spiritual position abraham there as a young man he gets married and uh he's he's going through life and then god calls him out now look we all know that it's this hard sometimes to break away from those things which are comfortable we we have our little patterns of life right and we come and you know it's kind of like hey dad has his favorite chair and the children know that when dad comes in the room if you're sitting in dad's chair you have to get up and move and and so we have a deference to these things and and we see how that abraham as a young man he's starting out in life he has a beautiful wife and uh he's he's there and then god calls him out and if we're not careful saints we will find ourselves in the time of life thinking that sometimes god has called you to a a difficult task or called you to something that uh seems to be laborious it seems to be a struggle but i'm telling you if god called you out then he provided a way for you amen and so it's there being called out is something we should say amen to we should say thank you lord i'm called out would one of you acknowledge that's the truth that we need to say thank you lord i'm called out because we could still be out here drunks in an alley or just caught up in all the things of the world not even knowing god but god loved you so much he says i'm going to call you out of that and i'm thankful for the spiritual pattern that was laid before us because if you look into abraham's life abram's life actually be technical at that stage and you look at that my brother and sister he was a man quite accomplished he he was gathering up things you might say becoming wealthy in the things of the world and ultimately in the end god never took that from him but what he did is he required a greater commitment from abram and as he's calling to abram abram actually did not in the beginning completely listen to god but god used those things to mold him and ultimately brought him to a place that he wanted what god was and what i'm speaking about there is lot because god told him to separate himself completely from his family but you know abram had a a affinity for lot and he takes him with him but as the years go on there becomes a friction and i say thank you lord sometimes hard for us to really accept that but there are people that are detrimental in our life there are things that are detrimental in our life and god starts to create a friction in that that causes a separation and while abram felt committed to lot to help take care of him god allows that friction to come to a place because god's prophecy or god's word for for abram abraham to to come to pass he had to come into a certain position the friction is there one day it comes such that they stand there and they look down into the well-watered plains and they look out into the dry dusty lands and abram says you know what lot you take your position whatever you will do i will do the opposite but that really my brother and sister was easier for abraham to say than we think because he in his heart knew what lot would choose would he choose the harder way now this sounds judgmental but the word bears it out lot was actually a sunday christian he could deal his relationship with god he could fill that relationship up on sunday some might say well that's incredible that's awesome that's good that's my kind of but you see god was looking for someone that wanted a everyday relationship he was looking for someone that would be dependent enough to say you know what i don't just need god on sunday i need him every day of the week amen so it was there that this spiritual pattern is now laid out for us now look my brother and sister we see this promise coming down a promised child that was promised to abraham and sarah and in that you look at that and realize now this is about a child and and those that families that desire to have children can't uh certainly would be able to relate to this much more maybe than some of us would but you look at this and realize my brother and sister as god made a promise to abraham and sarah now it's there that we find that was abraham just flawless in his following of god from that day on no my brother and sister he comes down a king looks upon his wife she's fair what it is is we saw body change taking place now abraham is here living with his wife and he's missing the fulfillment of the promise of god it was so subtle and so slow just like the things god is doing in your life he is changing us sometimes so slowly we as an individual don't even recognize what god is doing and so we're going along saying lord help me i have certain things maybe i'm impatient maybe i have this maybe whatever it but we don't recognize that god is changing us but others on the outside are and i'm telling you when you have a king that looks in an old lady it's kind of kind of blunt way to put it isn't it a king looks at an old lady and says she's so beautiful i want to make her my wife he was seeing something different than abraham was oh i'm telling you what my brother and sister you go out here in the world today and they will look at you and might say well you're just a christian you're a little fanatical you pray you read your bible you live different than everyone else but god's looking down and he's seeing something different than the rest of the world is seeing god's seeing a bride by the word of god by revelations 19 being transformed she's making herself ready and god says that's beauty in my eyes the world sees a bunch of religious freaks that are well there they're just we don't understand that what do we need a god for let's go have fun but every one of us that god has called made a promise to us every one of us the spiritual pattern has been laid upon us you realize my brother and sister this spiritual pattern of the word has been laid upon us and everything that's outside of the pattern of god's word god is cutting it away slow but sure god is cutting it away because we will be in the image of christ the perfect image not close we joke my brother and sister that it's not about china's ability to innovate but it's about their ability to impersonate and you look in the world today you can give china anything anything and they will build you the replica of it and if they wanted to the replica could be just as good as the original but they don't really have a desire to build something good they have a desire to replicate it mass produce it and distribute it everywhere now if you all forgive me this morning i just want to liken that you say brother paul why are you talking about china and what they build because satan has that same pattern that he's replicating people that look walk and talk and he's filling it up he's flooding it over the world and the scripture says that they have a form of godliness they're not a mass a a aberration from a christian they have that form my brother and sister but they deny the power thereof so therefore they're just close it's not the original it's not the real thing it's just close and what god is looking for is the original seed in you and i is looking for original life in us hallelujah he's not looking for just filling the building he's looking for those people that will follow day and night good and bad and when the sun is shining and when it's cloudy and whatever it is and and so we see now as abraham coming to this place you see there's something special about being able to look to the promise now this would be personal with each one of you you'll have different circumstances but i just want to ask you this morning have you ever come to a place in your life that god started dealing with you on something and you knew that word was for you you know not pitchfork religion right where we sit here and go well lucy the pastor just said this i think that applies to them oh that was blunt yeah that belongs over here come on oh smile at me you've fought it you've thought it i hope brother so and so i hope sister so and so i hope they caught that well you didn't because you didn't have your hands out to catch it you were just gonna pass it along to who you thought it applied to whoa hallelujah i saw from the looks on all your faces that you were saying amen even though you didn't voice it but you see what we got to do my brother and sister is not just look and say oh god is good and god will do this and god will do that and god thomas says but you got to be able to look to that promise yourself and it might be blunt straight to your face amen like one man said once he says some of these christians sitting in church need a hatchet to the forehead i was like wow that's blunt and he said but some of you are so hard-headed that's what it would take to get your attention amen amen amen amen amen brother ivan bring the box of hatchets will we be honest this morning and say sometimes looking to the promise could be pretty hard the promise is right in front of us god said it maybe it's our healing maybe it's deliverance from something in our family maybe we have children or a parent or a spouse that's not serving god we look at that and it just appears that nothing's changing nothing's changing what is the promise of the word say them do we sit here and do nothing do we sit here and just hope or do we look to the promise now when we look to the promise my brother and sister that doesn't mean that we just obliterate everything else and we don't do this you know it reminds me of a man that i knew a brother had cancer and and people were like oh brother it don't seem like you believe for your healing because this brother talk about his cancer all the time he's like yeah the doctor says it's moved from here to my liver and now it's going to move to here and and you know that's what the doctor says there's nothing they can do about it amen but what they failed to recognize he as a man was talking about the circumstance he didn't take and put his head in the sand over here and say now no i have no cancer i have no cancer he was acknowledging that it's demon as it were that's what the bible calls it this demon cancer was in his body he wasn't hiding the circumstance he was doing that amen he didn't deny the circumstance by putting his head in the sand but he chose by faith this brother i can speak of this god healed him he chose by faith to look beyond yeah most people are like well he sure seems caught up in talking about his cancer yeah the doctor said this and this is they got this x-ray and they did this mri and they did this and they did this and blah blah blah and they're like oh my goodness oh my goodness he needs to have faith see they failed to understand that him acknowledging there was a certain thing right here you know kind of reminds me there's a man i haven't seen anything from him uh posted or or whatever for a long time but he would be there and he was talking about faith and he was talking about those things that are as though they are not and those things that are not as though they are and as he's speaking he reaches over and pulls off his fake arm and he says sometimes and he holds up this stub sometimes you've got to acknowledge those things that are not and then he turned right around and says but i serve a god who's a healer whether you believe in that or not that's the god i serve this brother i was telling you about he was talking about yeah yep this cancer this this and people question this and then the brother comes along one day and he makes a declaration he says above and beyond all else my god is a healer now speaking revelation to his soul not i hope he is or the word says he is now you want to catch the difference right words the significance of words my god is not the word says he is or someone else says he is my god possessive right forget my english it wasn't very good but it was possessive my god is a healer and people are like boy that brother shouldn't even talk about he shouldn't even acknowledge he has cancers he he's like giving glory to the devil or something you know he shouldn't do that no what he was doing was saying i have this but my god's a healer this is what i really have this is what i have is faith i have faith that my god is a healer and i have faith that my god is perfect and i have faith that god's will be done and one day he goes to the doctor and the doctor says we're going to do another test on you and he's like oh my the devil tried to inject into him oh what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong they're doing another test and the doctor comes back and says do you mind we want to do an extensive test on you and we want to open you up and go in and take another biopsy and the devil trying to inject that oh my this cancer probably blew up or something and he was like nope i refuse to accept that see he had a balance in there he says i refuse to accept that because my body is a healer and ultimately the doctors come back and say we cannot explain this but you are cancer-free and then he moved into an opposite realm and people are like what happened well i was praying and i know sir my god is a healer how god healed me what god did i don't need to know what i know is he healed me so you see you can acknowledge the circumstance that is around your life look my brother and sister if you have anger you don't have to act like you don't have anger if you have a a temper you don't have to act like you don't have a temper you might as well stand up this bible says confess your faults one to another you might as well stand up and say hey church pray for me i have a temper church pray for me i have this problem church pray for me i have this problem but you see we're still too proud and while we only are fooling ourself because we have our head in the sand our circumstance is still there you can embrace your circumstance are you with me maybe maybe that comes a different way than you're used to hearing it you can embrace your circumstances i need god to touch me i have a blood sugar issue amen i probably don't help it you know sometimes you know if there's like a cinnamon roll or something and i hear it calling me oh paul oh paul and sister jerry goes out in the garage and i can't help it to the cyrene song and i go over there and i'm like honey these cinnamon rolls are so good and she's like get out of it that wasn't for you i couldn't help myself but i'll tell you even standing here this morning my god is a healer i am healed in the name of jesus christ prick my finger and the little digital thing will give you a number that you'll all go ah paul but that has nothing to do with the fact my god is a healer you see abraham's getting old sarah's getting old couldn't forget that i find humor in this sister jerry i'm honestly i'm not throwing my wife under the bus but i looked this morning i was looking in the mirror and i i was like oh my oh my lord help us i told sister jerry i said i wouldn't be in this condition if you would quit having birthdays see it wasn't my fault it's her fault she's the one having the birthdays but none of that changes my brother and sister because you see we can not try and hide the circumstance not deny that's head in the sand but we choose by faith to look beyond that circumstance my sister deborah walker passed away breaks my heart she was a unique lady amen she was of a rugged personality you might say you know australians and you know they're just a different kind of people so you know they they lived in australia and new zealand so you taken hybrid an aussie with a kiwi and you end up with people that will tell you what they think you ought to hear whether you like it or not and they won't hesitate to tell you what they think you need to hear but god bless her because she stood right here in these last moments when people were were saying oh this is so terrible and she's like what do you mean terrible i'm right on the doorstep of looking my savior face to face i'm right on the doorstep of glory and you're telling me this is terrible i'm sorry i'm looking at this picture differently than you are god help us to be able to look at the picture in the correct fashion help us to be able to look at that and get our head out of the sand and realize that our faith is what matters it's not our circumstance at all amen now let me repeat this to you you have to i have to look to the promise because your circumstance will overwhelm you for christian we have no other place to look okay right we're preaching to the fathers this morning aren't we hallelujah well i'm going to skip over some of this kind of quickly here because you know me i get started and somebody stole the time already because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed not that only which is of the law but also to that which is of faith of abraham who is the father of us all as is written i've made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were now in the world we live in today my brother and sister there is a term that is used i think it is used way too extensively and often oftentimes the people are using it it applies to them and they fail to realize that and that is cognitive dissonance and cognitive dissonance is basically in just laymen terms you failing to recognize what is in front of you and so the world would say today you know what you suffer from cognitive dissonance because you're denying this that and the other well my brother and sister i have a scriptural uh uh directive to deny what is in front of me i look in this my brother and sister and as we see our nation dissolving into chaos now we live here in treasure valley we're here and we say my what is happening some of this is overdone but you know if you live in other cities seattle portland detroit chicago baltimore milwaukee et cetera et cetera they have a whole different reality i say thank you lord for the state of idaho amen i thank you lord for where you called us to because my brother and sister you see the chaos that's taking place in the world around us is the fulfillment of the word of god but you and i are also fulfilling the word of god this morning because we are standing here saying amen and so be it to the word and the word is transforming us we're not the same person and so as we'll see here what god was doing in abraham is going through all of these circumstances that he had to go through he had to go down he had to watch lot go down and end up in sodom he had to go rescue lord he had to do all of these things and they weren't just something we look at the page and say oh my look god did this god did this got this i want you to recognize this morning it's real it was just as real to them as every circumstance of your life is real to you today i don't got enough money to pay the mortgage it was just as real to them i don't have this my chariot broke down just as real to you amen all of these things are happening were applicable of the day but it is in that that god is fulfilling his call in your life and so it's there that is he is a father of nations he was there laid out now we're talking in the spiritual sense he was laid out to every circumstance but the word of god was sufficient in every circumstance in abraham's life not once did abraham come up and say god where art thou you forsaken me it was all just israel call those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken now you want to take what was spoken go home if you want to cheat use google see what the bible says to the true believer you will overwhelmingly find hundreds upon hundreds of scripture that tells you who you are in jesus christ you see it's already been spoken saints it's a matter of you and i saying yeah i believe that that's me i'm gonna i'm gonna take that oh oh i miss david i had lust of the flesh but i repented god said you're after my heart oh i had a struggle here david wanted to do something for the lord he steps out into a position that's not his does god strike him dead no but god let someone else die so that david could realize he was out of line doesn't seem right does it but god's plan must be fulfilled because it's written because it's written saints hallelujah so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb and verse 20 says he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded what he had promised he was able to perform i want to ask you this morning are you fully persuaded amen we ought to be fully persuaded this morning there ought not be one doubt if you're a real believer a christian amen not one doubt that what god promised he will perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness people are doing all kinds of things for righteousness sake you know my brother and sister i was just looking at this article the other day it's been around a long time no doubt you're aware of this but there's people who so believe in the crucifixion of jesus christ this takes place in lower mexico that they literally line up they volunteer and one of them is chosen they literally nail them to a cross and drag that cross through this city and that individual they're suffering many times crippled for life afterwards but so wanting to identify aren't you glad god just gave you the opportunity to go into his word and identify with him you see that right there that kind of work will not save that man's soul will not change him his confession in jesus christ his repentance his baptism his his faithfulness to god is what will save his soul but being nailed to a cross and erected up in the city square will not save that man but they're so committed to that believing i want you to just go ahead and do the homework of the rest of these scriptures you realize the scripture imputes this to us also says this is imputed to you not your works your faith now look in genesis 22. look at that very first verse right there and we all want everything to go good for us we want it to all be so cushy and cozy dads come on dads we want it to be cushy cozy we want it for the best for our family we make all kinds of sacrifices for our family and it came to pass after these things that god did what did he do to abraham the father of our faith father of nations a spiritual example to us god tempted him in the context of scripture it was god put him to a great test but what did abraham say behold here i am he said now take my son and we'll just go through this really quick take thy son i want you to go out i want you to take him up on the mountain i want you to offer him as a sacrifice you know how hard that would have been fathers can you imagine amen i i don't just single any one of you out but we have several young boys in our in our church imagine taking uh you know samuel uh declan uh sean you're a little big but you're an only son hallelujah and and we take them and god says take them on the mountain and offer them for sacrifice fathers could we do it could we so trust god enough be so committed because you see abraham had an understanding that when god told him he said i'm through your own flesh through your own blood cell i'm going to deliver a people would we have enough faith in the hour we live in my brother and sister my my fathers would we have enough faith to trust god when he said take your son upon the mountain and offer him as a sacrifice we go down in this scripture and here we see it is that how his son even understood that and it's there he looks at this and he's got in the verses here he's got the wood and he laid it upon isaac makes isaac carry the very wood that he will lay him on for a sacrifice amen and he's got this and they went together and isaac spake and to abraham his father and said my father here am i my son he said behold the fire the wood where's the lamb see the boy's been trained well enough he knew there had to be a lamb now we weren't looking for some any old thing when we weren't throwing a book we aren't throwing a uh carving we're not throwing or whatever it's coming to a place my brother and sister he knows there has to be a lamb and abraham what's he do he so believes in god's word that he just says you know what god will provide the lamb we're going to go but i want to let me paraphrase this and shorten it so we don't get too far along here when we get to the point my brother and sister that abraham has bound isaac and laid him on the altar this wasn't a make-believe like abraham's there now okay i've got the knife in my hand and i i'm just gonna i'm just gonna wait here because there's like no way there's no way i'm offering my boy there's no way god promised me there's no way fathers do we have this kind of faith god had to stay his hand speak to him and stay his hand he believed what god spoke to him so strongly that he was fixing to offer his own son that is faith that is faith i don't think he was there thinking god was going to give him an isaac the second we'll have another child he didn't look for an explanation of how god was going to do this he believed what god told him oh my i want to be that kind of father i want to be that kind of man i want to be that my son god will provide himself for lamb for burnt offering so they both went together now let's just look at this quotation here certainly god provided god's provided lamb god's provided sacrifice said now wait moses i'll make you a type and he took the blood of this lamb killed it in the evening notice all the elders of israel had to witness to it they witnessed the death just as they did up there they said let his blood be upon us right speaking of jesus christ and he died in the evening time jesus died at three o'clock and they took the blood of the lamb with hyssop and sprinkled it upon the doorpost now this talking back in egypt uh sprinkled upon the doorpost and on the lintel did you notice not on the floor it's not to be looked down to see what's happening in our world today a young man who say i don't drink i don't smoke i don't go out here and do these things you know fornication all these things i don't do this because i'm a christian this somebody said man that's good you've got to stand no sir what do they do they're ridiculed they're looking down and it's not that young man because he can't hold himself to that in the age that we live in can i speak just really blunt girls are more beautiful than ever i like the point brother brown makes about how any old school girls better looking than what that one actress lady was that was considered the most beautiful woman in the world time back in the 30s and any old school girls better looking than she is so we're living in a day my brother and sister for a young man or a young woman to hold themselves as sons and daughters of god hold themselves in purity that's not this flesh because the spirit of the age promotes everything under the sun right down there teaching it right down into the grade schools now and that's what it is but you see we have a revelation that it's not to be looked down on amen it's to be looked up to and notice on the doorpost and on the lintel perfect the cross that was a blood god said when i see the blood i'll pass i'll pass over you when i see the blood god's provided way how are we going to escape the death he says i'll watch for the blood now look i want you you know this is right here in scripture but we're taking this kind of preaching this out of this quotation my brother and sister right down in in egypt and god said you know what i'm going to judge egypt and every household that doesn't have a blood over the doorpost i want you to you know i want you to recognize i want you to place a value this has to happen and there that night out and let's take a little drama i can notice the father of course in the old testament was the priest of the house some people think that died in the old testament but i'm telling you god's got a revival in the land that fathers are standing up and saying i'm going to be the priest of my house again i'm going to show my family not tell them to serve god i'm going to show them how to serve god i'm going to be the example in front of them and i'll we'll make mistakes can we say amen brothers amen but i will stand as an example and when i need to repent i'll repent and apologize when i need to apologize and i'll say i love you and i will create an atmosphere that my family will know that god is real in our house not just words hallelujah hallelujah priest of the house now he's a figurehead now he goes down and puts on the door in little post and when it come about that night i can see all the young girls down there come out tell the hebrew girls come on we're going out to the dance why they say we can't go we're under the blood look at the difference when a father would create such an atmosphere in his house and literally take as it were that blood and put it on the doorpost and the lintel and his children seeing it so real no one has to say now daughter of mine if you sneak out and go dancing i'll take your phone away daughter of mine if you sneak out and go dancing you won't get keys to the car but imagine an atmosphere that's been created in a home of a father who took the word took the blood of jesus christ and put it over the door of his house and have a daughter that would say i can't go out and go dancing i can't do that because my daddy said so no sir you catch the significance because i little girl speaking because i am under the blood not our church says not the pastor says not daddy says not mama says but a little girl herself saying i am under the blood i can't do that that's when we see a change in a church that's when we see a change in lives they say that rules without respect equals rebellion my brother and sister i'll change it to this right here rules without example will lead to rebellion there's got to be an example there's got to be a father and when i speak to this i speak in the context of the family there's got to be a father stands up and says children this is what the word of god says this is what we're going to do hallelujah let's have a good time we're under the blood what a type we're coming in god's provided way nonsense with that religion whoever thought that blood would do anything come on out let's have a good time but they stayed under the blood and god said when you go under the blood stay there not in and out in and out stay there after a while come midnight great dark roaring cloud come up i can look back look how this is dramaticized here i look coming back over yonder i can see two big black wings spread out across the nation here it comes i can hear the priest of the family the father say what was this i hear the priest of the family got their own private priest right there in their home they don't have to get in the car drive down the street knock on the door and walk in and ask for a priest they got a priest in their home they've got someone who is there intercessing intermingling bringing the word of god living it out in flesh filled with the spirit the very life of god i read a very beautiful very beautiful beautiful uh uh memorial here a few days ago of a father passed away a grown daughter children of her own wrote this memorial of her father and she said when i was a little girl my father was an alcoholic and life was difficult in our home but one day my daddy met jesus christ and he not only met him he became him and since that day i've had a living example of jesus christ in my life is that not a beautiful testimony memorial of a man life was difficult but my daddy met jesus christ and become him not just talking about it but he literally she testifies as though he'd been and does not the scripture say christ in you the hope of glory life-changing event not just a man i go to church but a man who's strove with all of his might to be jesus christ representation to his own children hallelujah god help us to be that kind of father i can hear the priests of the family the father say there's a death angel sweeping the land now too late now and directly i can see him dip down into a valley and hear his scream come up from out of that house the sun was dead away he went directly here he comes right down to another house again goes in big black wings close in around the house and a scream comes up the sun is dead and i can hear a little boy say daddy can you hear it i can hear it daddy take another look be sure the blood's on there you see this is a household that the little boy he believed what he heard an atmosphere been created and when the dad says we've got to kill the lamb and we've got to put the blood on the doorpost and over the lentil because the word says that everyone who's outside of that token the firstborn son will and here's a son he's not saying oh daddy that's nonsense god don't do that god don't do that no here's a boy he believes it daddy take another look be sure the blood's on there yes sir i tell you if there's ever a time a man ought to be examining himself is right now brother is the blood on the door watch around and look good and the next thing you know he kept watching for that little fellow said daddy them wings make me nervous oh you know what i'm gonna i wanna i wanna i don't want you to read that yet we ought to be nervous right shouldn't we be a wreck today saints come on i'm gonna just be real blunt shouldn't we be wreck that our our young daughters our young sons are just gonna fall apart turn into drug addicts be on the streets shouldn't we be just nervous to fall apart oh what's going to happen what's going to happen oh well it whatever will happen will happen we just know this is nothing we can do about us the age that we live in i mean you know after all we got got to give them an iphone and we got to get them with that access to the internet and we have to just let them go to school and believe whatever they teach it we just there's nothing we can do about it no sir we put the blood oh are you with me saints we put the blood on the doorpost in the lintel and we create an atmosphere where our children can say daddy is a holy ghost in our house daddy is a holy ghost in our family i want the holy ghost i want the life of christ i want to do this i don't want to die like my friend over here is on drugs in an alley now if you're a native of nampa you'll see a young man who walks up and down the street basically in the region that used to be the old karcher mall he's exactly my age i went to high school with him started on drugs in the sixth grade and his family says huh there's nothing we can do about it huey is out of his mind and as i said if you're native here and you've driven this boulevard you've seen him with his kinky curly hair sloping along the sidewalks why because his daddy took a position there's nothing i can do about it god help us to be real fathers god help us to be my son you are there you're you're looking at them wings make you make you nervous well let daddy assure you i have put the token i have put the blood on the door post and over the lintel in the door post i can assure you i've done what god said i tell you my brother and sister go naming names unless someone would meet them and sorry huey let's you he's so burnt himself i've tried to talk to him before you eat do you remember me no i don't have any friends okay it's where it's at why didn't someone care enough about you when he's a sixth grader but the atmosphere was created we're too busy for you son we're too busy for you we've got careers we've got this we've got that we've got businesses to run but there's a father oh god help us it was called to action and he's there and this is the kind of father i want to be son be of good cheer we've placed the holy ghost over our household we have placed the life of christ in our midst it's not just religion to us it's life feel good cheer there's blood on the door that's god's provided way we're in this way hallelujah don't make any difference what the world says we're under the blood hallelujah so it is today of every man that's born of the holy ghost under the blood don't care what the world's got to say about it i want to ask you my brother and sister what do you care what they say out here quite honestly you serve god you pray over your food i read a comment the other day where a guy was talking about how he was in a restaurant and he prayed over his food and some guy walked by him and says you still do that nonsense yes i do hallelujah because i wouldn't trade everything you've got for everything i've got or as one man said i wouldn't trade everything you got for a sliver of what i've got see we don't care what's the world my brother sister it's producing what they wanted it to produce i don't care what the world's got to say about call you a fanatic if they want to as long as you know the blood's applied all right he said there's no danger isn't it beautiful look i want to speak for our fathers here today because i believe we have an awesome group of fathers i want to speak for it you know what the answer is in the blood but it's not just to talk about the blood it's the blood applied he could have said no son here we we we slew the lamb we offered the lamb and we've got the blood right here we got the blood right here do you know if he'd just had that blood in that dish that bowl that death angel would have swept in there wrapped its arms around the house and his boy would have died that was a promise to egypt that was a promise in the hour so it wasn't just we have blood we have blood oh we got the blood of jesus so many beautiful songs there is concerning the blood of jesus christ we've got the blood we've got the blood we've got the deal but there is a song that i just love listening to some some pentecostal lady charity gayle sings that thank you lord for the blood applied the whole secret if you haven't listened to it i encourage you to go to to to something like youtube or whatever and listen to it because really there's depth in that song thank you jesus for the blood applied stand at the window and hold the bowl up and say death angel we've got the blood no sir it had to be applied and then when you come there you see my brother and sister and first thing you know those big black wings swept down towards that house he's seen the blood and just passed on over it how marvelous fathers let's not be delinquent let's not be tardy but let's apply the blood to our houses for the saving of our own souls for the saving you know it's interesting that scripture lays a foundation that a wife will never answer for her husband but husband will answer for his wife children will never answer for their father but a father will answer for his children have i got you all sad now some of you look like i've got you sad i want to ask you this as we come to close where will you ever find a reference in the scripture that god asked abraham to take the easy route never once did god ask abraham take the easy route he tempted abraham that's what it says put him to the test brothers fathers would we have courage enough this morning to lift a hand and say lord for the sake of my family for the future of my family i stand here and say lord test me try me prove me lord prove me that i would be able to prove jesus christ to my family but you know we got saints now i say this kind of lightly i didn't come across as lighthearted as i felt when i studied this i'm sorry this morning what we got today this is really kind of a slam on manhood and i believe in physical fitness i i'm not you know the bible says it profiteth very very very can i emphasize to some of you young people very very very very very very very very very very very very little you know what we've gotten this day we've got guys on the street everywhere you go they got their teenage son's t-shirt on they walk down the street and their daughter says daddy they're having a party over at my friend's house and there's going to be a bunch of grown-up college boys and there's going to be alcohol and drugs and they're going to watch some terrible movies and the guy's like i just don't want to break my little girl's heart i just have to say yes because otherwise my my daughter won't speak to me all week yeah go honey hope you survived the night they're not men i don't care pot-bellied bald-headed whatever it might be for a father to be able to stand and look at his daughter and say honey there's not going to be one good thing happen at that party tonight there's not going to be one thing that when you're 30 years old you'll say i'm so glad i was there and so i know you're going to be angry but your mama's going to be camped at your bedroom door and i'm going to be camped at your bedroom window and you're going to be home tonight doing your homework my daddy's so cruel he doesn't even love me so and so her daddy loves her he not only let her go to the party he gave her money to buy drugs with and he gave her no sir a real father says i'm not looking to raise a good child i'm looking to raise a good adult i'm looking to raise a son or a daughter that at 30 years old will be able to look in their children and say look at your grandfather and look at your daddy this is what is the right thing to do and our family does the right thing but what are we getting the opposite great big macho men post all over social media deadlifted 575 pounds ran 30 miles i did i got the biggest fish i shot the biggest deer and their children iraq why because they don't understand the value of the blood on the doorpost and the lintel that's what makes a real father when he says i'm here to lead my children not tell them to go to church right brother brown said don't don't send your kids to church take them i'm glad we have we have families we have parents here that don't just send their kids to church they they take them to church now i want to close on this sister emmy would you come so that way i will be forced to close every son and daughter must be tempted right is that not the scripture god says every time he's ever called you he'll make the way for you yeah now look we can find this scriptural reference right here find it as a scriptural reference i should say and john was one of those men that did not hold back any punches i've been studying john and i want to be a preacher like john so you guys hang on right because we're just gonna quit you know we're just gonna not pull any punches he just let her fly it made no difference to him if his head off it was head off that's all just like elijah it is right out forward with what he had to say what was right was right and it was wrong it's wrong god we need more like that today men who will stand on a real genuine convictions of the word of god speak it and don't hold your peace speak it out fathers god bless you i love every one of you i love what i see happening in your families speak the truth in your family even oh i know this is so hard i forgot to stop and buy band-aids even if your children might say wait dad you just said this you can look them in the face come on you can look him in the face and say i know dad didn't do that but dad knows and he's trying and this is what is right even if dad didn't line up to it can we be men like that where we would actually judge ourselves in front of our own family and say i've come short but i don't want to be short and i'm not going to raise another generation of people coming short because i'm embarrassed that i came short what i'm going to do is stand up like a man i got what a real father and say i didn't do what i was supposed to do children but while we know what we should do and i want to do it i want to live it i want to be this kind of man god help us i want to be that kind of man man i tell you what if i gave you a list of the mistakes i made as a parent you guys would be calling child protective services and saying well his youngest is in her 30s but you should still take away from him [Music] i made those kind of mistakes but here i am today and this is me practicing what i preach i can stand here today and tell you what not to do because i did that and it don't work but i can also stand here today by god's grace and mercy and tell you what works and fathers i've got just simple words for you on what works apply the blood on the doorpost and it'll all work out just fine hallelujah i love you saints i know i've been on a cranky mood lately some of you just frowning at me in church like oh my goodness he's just ripping her height off right and left but you know what i i just wanna i wanna see look we're not gonna have church where i tell you right now now look for every hundred dollars you put in the offering god's gonna give you a 500 percent increase and so if you'll just empty your savings account and throw it in mice's word it's not a reward for the greatest giver right or there's no reward reminds me and i'm not making lie to this i thought it was quite an accomplishment read a deal this church is in the midwest and and um this lady was 55 i think received award has not missed a church service since she was 10 years old i think that must be an isaiah somewhere because otherwise i can't find a scripture where he says blessed are they that never miss church [Music] if you find that scripture please let me know because i don't want to misquote it but he does say blessed are those who what [Music] let me paraphrase it those who serve me those who live those who obey those who look to righteousness those are the ones he says you know sister jerry sent me a very interesting little deal the other day and i appreciate that it says well done my good and faithful and has a whole list of these things the little line through but down there at the bottom servant not well done my good and faithful leader ceo encourager this that's this no servant oh god help us hallelujah if somebody wants me to quit say amen [Music] so it is today i didn't even hear a single amen can you imagine that and so it is today my brother and sister let me disclose on these words fathers we have a holy calling in an age look at this some people say oh oh you know it's just kind of overblown no it's not we're at war on our fathers we're at war on the men because you see when a man gets out of his position nowhere in scripture and i'm not a what do they call them sexist or whatever you know when the man thinks he's dominant chauvinist yeah whatever the words are but you won't find in the scripture wife go kill a lamb go put blood on the doorpost in the lentil no sir it was the man's job it was a man's job to stand up according to the word put the blood on it why what we're doing we're turning it all around we're turning it upside down the scripture says those things that are good they'll call evil those things that are evil they'll call good amen i like that when the portland police chief you know is talking about how down there in downtown portland car dealership there with about 500 cars on it new cars 500 cars there they bashed the windows out every one of them and the portland police chief said well the kids are just expressing themselves now call evil good hallelujah and i want you to look here look here fathers we have a holy calling once again the testing is taking place once again revival is coming in the land revival is coming to the people fathers counted up and saying you know what i'm going to stand for the word of god and i'm going to tell the world i'm going to let the world know i'm not perfect but i'm trying i'm going to be there and let god deal with me and i'm going to do this and the word is restoring the priest back in the home can you brothers say amen to that the word is restoring it's not us brute force take it back but the words restoring our place men are not afraid to stand on the word of god not afraid to stand for the word and to stand openly you know i'm a ferocious reader saints and sometimes i just get caught up in reading we're just reading recently a man in a political office when he was called out now usually when they use the word somebody being outed they're talking about sexual orientation you know they were outed but this man was outed in his state legislature for being a christian and i thought what a shame that we have to be outed [Music] that we were a christian in other words nobody knew nobody could figure this out it was a secret it was a mystery where is it that men would stand up and say i don't care what you think my god's first my family's second and everything else can follow along behind that but what is it this man was embarrassed and actually apologized to his fellow legislators for for being a christian i say they ought to strip him publicly of the name christian because christ like you never seen jesus here he is coming the backside of bethany [Music] let me pray for you bless you no sorry come and he let him know you think the priests were excited he showed up in town not at all but he didn't hide and neither will any man whose how would i word that filled with the spirit any man anointed by the word any man that's confessed that jesus christ is lord and savior you see it's an anointing to stand openly in the hour we live in you might not agree with tim tebow's doctrines or whatever you believe but there's a man who's went to the highest level of sports in our nation and stood there and told them i'm a christian and they have mocked him in every way a man can be mocked they have mocked him and you know what he says he says i'm so thankful that god allowed them to do that because i had to decide whether playing sports was first or god was first and i chose god and they chose sports well hallelujah thank you lord amen well oh my brother jason come lead us in some songs i'll let you get all the people out of their sorrowful state dad i want you to stand up for what is right don't compromise don't look at your own failure don't look at your own struggle and just stand up and say you know what i'm going to do what the word called me to do even if i have to back up and repent to my family you know what's hard men i'm just talking to you the rest of you plug your ears not no sisters no wives listen isn't it so hard sometimes to acknowledge to our family we've made mistakes it can it can be difficult it's kind of a man pride thing to be able to say you know what i i didn't react right and i don't want this to be too personal to any of you so i'll keep it close to home i married this girl and some days i think she says i wonder what this button does now what we'd like to do is blame the wife for the button she pushed but it has nothing to do with the wife and the button she pushed it has all to do with how we respond to it and we can say him yes that is my defensive guilt button and normally i would be angry and tell you i wouldn't have done that or said that except for you said this and you did that and then your mama and then it was this and [Music] how about we get to the place brothers the devil can't push the button wife can't push the button kids can't push the button god's the only one that could push the button and then there's where we have harmony in our homes there's where the holy spirit moves in our midst there we're not ashamed to walk out on our front step and the neighbor across the road going hey paul what what are you doing well the word said slay the lamb and put the blood on the doorpost you really don't believe that do you worry we go to church together we're all christians what are you talking about that's fanaticism and when a man can come to the place he can say i know but that's what the word said and he puts the blood and he walks back in the door and says i don't care what they think but i do care about my son i care about my my wife my son my daughter i care about them i don't care about what anybody else thinks i'm gonna put the blood over the door in my house all saints god help us i know this is a little direct little bunt today amen but i wanted to be these things burdens just been on my heart for for literally weeks looking at these things why if the bridge is out are we not remiss if we don't warn people the bridge is out [Music] it's my job thank you lord let the death angel pass [Music] that we could be saved oh hallelujah [Music] [Applause] all the lord spoke to moses and told him what to say to the children of israel it goes in that day [Music] [Music] oh let the death angel pass and we could be safe oh hallelujah and glory to god all the love the spirit of heart let the deaf angel pass oh sweet holy spirit is the topic [Music] outside [Music] say let the deaf angel pass god's pride shake my life oh oh glory to god the blood's been applied spirited upon my redeemer is faithful and true hallelujah is faithful let's just stand and worship the lord everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer faithful and true oh my redeemer is faithful and true [Music] is are new my redeemer is faithful and true i don't know if we know this so well but we'll sing it anyway as i look back on the underworld i travel i see so many

every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true [Music] my heart rejoices when i read the prophets there is a place i'm praying for you if there is one thing i've learned in this life my redeemer is faithful and true yes worshipping this morning faithful and true everything he has said he will do my redeemer is faithful and true hallelujah i just feel led to say this this morning say brother paul what was you trying to say about the circumstances earlier well i'll i'll just put in this context feel like for this spoke to me i've got a son daughter-in-law grandchildren

house i wasn't she was her heart was right her desire was right but it wasn't her job in the formative years of my children's life they saw no example of a father with a hyssop and the blood and i stand here today and my heart breaks of the atmosphere i created oh i can say but it was reason of my childhood it was a reason of this and it was a reason that it was a reason that i never stood up and did what god called me to do [Music] but the word says apply the blood i'm a little late saints i've got daughters and grandchildren that are serving the lord and i thank the lord for that but i've got a son oh don't talk about that we'll apply the token reply the token no let's get down to the rubber meets the road saints i've got a son i've got a daughter-in-law i've got grandchildren and

you from picking up the hyssop and the blood and applying it look your children if they're grown up in the face and say your father made mistakes i didn't do things right but by god's grace i want you to see that by his grace and his mercy i'm applying the blood i'm applying the blood my brother and sister we're going to get there sooner or later here about the mercy scene the death angel hasn't
