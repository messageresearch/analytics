Lord Jesus amen hallelujah God is good isn't he all the time praise the Lord amen it's just good to be here tonight and good to be Mike's people of like precious faith and we just want to see God work the way he wants to work amen it's always a blessing to be among his people and we just greet you in the name of the Lord bring greetings from Monmouth and we have been reduced 25 people in a meeting so this weekend is going to be an experiment we're gonna have two on Saturday and two on on Sunday amen so divided everybody up in groups and I said I'm sorry I can't please everybody but this is how it's going so praise the Lord and but God is he's no lesser of God in times of trouble Amen I'm getting ready to retire in June and I just been saying all along no matter if my retirement there or not and I tell you God is taking me on my word amen because most of the retirement at least on one side of it is it's probably half but I'm not worried about that because little as much when God is in it when he has started something you'll finish something a man and we grew up living by faith and all of us here have grown up living by faith in and oh I forgot brother Eugene from Ukraine said to greet the people that would know him from Dennis came in I don't know if there's any here or not but he right there he just gave a testimony of a woman at their church who had been plagued with smoking and they all prayed for she said this is it I got to be delivered and they all prayed for and they'd seen a black cloud leave her and go out the door amen and so I tell you what you get closer to God when you need him when you're under persecution amen and so this light affliction that we have hey Matt it's only make you stronger praise the Lord let's stand and turn to Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 through 19 and we're going to read there's going to be some other scriptures and inserted in between but we're going to read through revelation 3:14 through 19 some of the other scriptures in between our Colossians 1:18 and second Corinthians 5:19 and some others amen and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Lord we want you to speak your mind tonight I just thank you so much Lord God God you did it again I want to go another direction but God you kept bringing me back to this sermon and so I just God I'm believing and trust in God this will speak to the ha of someone here tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you may be seated and so I like that because unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God he immediately establishes who he is what he will do amen and so he's victorious he's faithful a man he's true praise the Lord Jesus but he says at the end the beginning of the creation of God and we know that that Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God amen because he was the firstborn from the dead he was the first of the super race amen in in the in the sense of he was God he was flesh but had God dwelling in him amen and he was that wave sheaf to the rest of the world to the end of time that you and I would live that way victorious and overcoming Amen Colossians 1:18 it says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen and so his idea of of lordship is to have the preeminence through our flesh as God the Father had preeminence through his flesh amen and he says I do nothing unless I see the father do it amen and with us we can say we do nothing unless the Spirit allows us to see it in the word and so the difference with the bride is that she sees and does things in the time and the season of the word amen she doesn't get ahead of God amen but she she does exactly what he wants her to do amen that's why our decision to slow down amen because now we're searching and praying for what the what the Word of God wants us to do amen second Corinthians 5:19 it says to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing the trespass their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation oh I love that amen we serve a God who knew us when we were born he we didn't know him but we were permitted to calm his brother Baron said we were permitted to have a soul but the soul was of the devil a man because it only knew unbelief but when we were of age he began to draw us to himself and he brought us to the point where we received him a man by faith and then we were justified and sanctified and we came and received the gift of the Holy Spirit after we were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but his whole nature is reconciliation and so that's why those that smoke those that may be addicted to different drugs or addicted to habits or things Amen God is here to reconcile them back amen don't give up on your relatives don't give up on those who you think are not savable amen because look at Paul Amen he was he they thought he was unsavable that he exists and they didn't even know it amen hallelujah God is a miracle working God he's the god of reconciliation and so God is a spirit and so he had to create a body a piece of the earth so that he could come and redeem his creation back to him amen and so that's why we were laying in the earth and he we were born were part of this earth but it was his plan that way because Christ was a part of that earth but with the fullness of the Father in him but now in our day and time we have its a portion of it yet it's the fullness of him back inside amen and with that portion then we are walking around victorious amen we we can speak the word and God will heal us nothing that is not in if it's in the word then speak and go forward amen it says it's only the spirit of Laodicea that will keep us in fear amen break out of fear hallelujah and let let the word let the Holy Ghost that should be in us amen just release the word amen hallelujah amen first Corinthians 6 17 how are we joined to him by one spirits amen there's not there's not a hundred different denominations in the message there's not a hundred different versions of the message there's not there's one and the one that is real is powerful and it is quick and sharper than any two-edged sword Amen that that revelation Amen you will walk around as a god upon this earth because you have Jesus Christ in you you are a little time hallelujah but it says in 1st Corinthians 6:17 but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit amen hallelujah and that's why the bride she is one Amen just because you go to a message Church it doesn't make you bride but there's Brides in every message Church amen and that's why the Holy Spirit in you calls out to the others amen that's why when you go to a church you're looking around and God allows you to run into the believers Amen hallelujah 1st Corinthians 12:13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body one bride amen whether we be Jew or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen and so there's one spirit one Lord one baptism one word one one interpretation amen hallelujah Ephesians 2:18 and 19 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners God knows you now when he comes down and and brings a conversion which the conversion is the filling of the Holy Spirit now he knows you you're not a stranger you're not a foreigner anymore but fellow-citizens with the Saints with the mystical body of Jesus Christ and of the household of God you are now part of his kingdom amen Oh hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus because you've been borne by one spirit Philippians 1:27 and then we'll slow down the scriptures but I want to I want to nail this down only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that's why we talk when you get together we talk about Jesus we talk about the word amen we talk about what he's done we we exchanged text testimonies that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel amen one mind one spirit amen and we're all with our arms spiritually locked together going forward amen and victorious praise the Lord Jesus and so what was going on and we'll get to the rest of Revelation chapter three through 19 what was going on with Jesus he was the manifested word amen and that's why we're the religions and the religious people of the day they didn't understand him amen in fact I don't forget if it was Felix or one of the other rulers a man they actually wanted to believe in Jesus a man more than the religious leaders did hallelujah a man because he wasn't all cluttered up with religion and it's so wonderful that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested then he's manifested today and he will be manifested at the end hallelujah and he was the word amen if we are part of the body than we are part of the word hallelujah and so all God's sons and daughters are part of the word a portion of the earth amen and so you have to receive his spirit if you're part of him you must be filled Amen hallelujah and so when he does that he redeems you he sees you he sees your need he sees your life and he says I want to get into that life I want to be victorious through them I want them to just release everything to me amen hallelujah and so we become the manifested word when the foolish when the wise virgin and the foolish virgin were together what was the difference amen one had lamps well they both had lamps and though others had some oil but they ran out but the bride the the wise had oil and it was on fire it was burning which brother Bram says means word manifesting in their life amen hallelujah hey man praise the Lord back to Revelation chapter 3 15 through 19 I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou wert cold or hot amen so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth hallelujah see at work in the fire department most of our personalities are we like to know our enemies and you respect somebody who doesn't like you Amen I men are like that I don't know how women are cuz I'm a man but I like a person who would just tell me what he thinks and then and then we can work together see at work we don't have to like each other but when we are we face a common common enemy whether it's a heart problem or a lung problem or a heart attack or a house fire or a structure fire then we come together under one common goal amen and then it doesn't matter what I'm working with an atheist who hates me doesn't matter if I'm working with a hypocrite it doesn't matter if I'm working with other Christians amen we come under one common goal amen hallelujah and and we know that that when when we know where we stand oh I like that amen and so that's the way it is with us I want to know where we stand and and and and I want each one of us no matter if you're just starting out or you're a veteran of the faith a man being honest with God just letting them know where you stand let people know where you stand a man that the ministry know where you stand and then God can help you amen hallelujah because they'll say us I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked what is going on with latest Ian Church it is the church that doesn't have the token amen that's the difference they don't have the token they have many of them have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on them on their flesh on the spirit realm and that doesn't have to be just signs and wonders and miracles that can be intellectual stimulation amen I counselled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou it may us be rich amen and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that tell me us to be free as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent oh I just God wants this age to receive the anointed word amen I just I feel so sorry for people when they when they think they have it all a man they think they have this message figured out yet their life is screaming unbelief amen and and so I don't dislike those people but my heart cries out and says Oh God open their eyes give to my savvy men how they do but for the grace of God there goes us amen oh we are so fortunate and so for a minute here let's look at three different types of people in the eyes of the Lord amen one is not a churchgoer I see them you see them at your work your school they don't have any mind of God and and so actually they're better off if you in their state right there but they don't have any mind of God but the other one you may work with or go to school with the other ones a churchgoer and and they think they're saved because they've been taught that that if you just confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior then you're saved and filled with the Holy Spirit so you have one of they think they're saved but they don't have the mind of God either because the mind of God is the Holy Spirit and so yet the two are going to the same destination unfortunately they don't realize it but the churchgoer looks at the one who has nothing from God and compares what they do and what they say amen to them amen so let's keep that in mind they're comparing their goodness to that person's lack of goodness amen right so the next the third person let's say is Full Gospel they have way more revelation than even that person who is religious and goes to church they have maybe the signs the wonders and miracles yet they are looking again at the behavior of the religious one and the behavior of the ungodly one and comparing their life and they're saying oh God I'm glad I'm not then I have you so I am going to your heaven amen and so we have those three people a man and and and I don't want to be any of those Haven hallelujah but see God is doing something different in this day he is looking for the people that are in that fourth group and that fourth group are people that compare who they are to Jesus Christ the word Amen how they knew who they say I don't know what the ungodly is doing I'm gonna pray for them I don't know what the church person is doing I don't know what the Full Gospel person's doing but all I want is to compare my life with this anointed word amen and and not a word from a days gone by but the fullness of the word today hallelujah we are living in that time of the Elijah ministry brother Graham says the bride is ministering amen it's a body ministry they're the great men and the message they're gone amen the fivefold ministry is absolutely part of the word but the looking for their salvation and their victory all the time through one of those five we are past that we are in the time where we are looking up to Jesus Christ the word Amen hallelujah so God is looking for that type of people God's looking for you and I just to stay with what the word says because here's here's the thing here's part of the plan is that the greater the revelation we profess then the greater recognition of unbelief hey man where there's more revelation there's more responsibility amen hallelujah and so God expects more from us and he says come up a little higher amen after a while he says come up a little higher come up a little higher aren't you glad he just doesn't kick you out amen when you're little a little guy is starting to walk and he trips you don't say get up what are you doing no you say get up and here's how to do it amen and that's what God is doing for us and so what is going on is that the Church of the Living God is being born together under the one spirit the Holy Ghost for today amen which is a powerful overcoming fullness amen and it always takes you back to the word it always takes you back to the word hallelujah praise the Lord Amen a lot of us do we've come out of the world have been transformed I love that we can look back and say that's not what I am anymore and I want to be more hallelujah and so if we think of that in relationship to what we claim we believe then we must work we're going to be the most clean and holy people on the face of this earth hallelujah because brother Brown says God's revelation is always pure and clean and holy amen because what God calls revelation is is not what we do around the message we call high revelation do we walk out of a service and you really don't know what they said now because a teacher will take things here and take them down - so the six and seven-year-olds can understand Amen praise the Lord Amen I was trained to be a teacher that's what you do and we have a teacher and in progress right there and you break it down so everybody can understand and you know what you do you you let them touch it you let them hear it and see it amen and that's the gospel it's just going into all the world not just the ministers and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them to believe yes you will do all the things that that the word says amen and part of those signs believing is they're going to see that you're a transformed person giving out of Jesus Christ the word hallelujah and so it's so gradual today that most churchgoers don't they don't realize that sin has taken control of their life it's so subtly men all the fundamental I work with a handful of them at work the fundamental believers amen they look at all the guys who who don't know anything about God and and and they try to get them to receive Christ they said just profess that Jesus Christ is Lord and you're saved amen and those guys are the biggest stumbling blocks there's a one and he's from Blues Mecca Stan awesome man trained to be a minister and he's he drinks like a fish amen he drinks alcohol and I'm just going what are you doing we have another one so intent on studying the word yet he's talking about all the different beers he likes to drink and I'm just going where is God in these people and see all of the unchurched those are my friends the ones that don't know anything about God because I respect them and they respect me hallelujah but those other ones are a stumbling block and they don't realize it brother Bram says that that a hypocrite is the biggest stumbling block to the to heaven than anything else amen but see the religious person has been taught that they can do anything Amen that even when it's not consistent with the word look at all the tattoos you see all over all the Christians there was a street preacher the other day down in our town and one of our brothers in Christ seen him and he had tattoos everywhere all over his head and again God can use that it we can't say Oh God can never use those things no you can't do that because God will get a hold of you wherever you're at amen but see they're taught things that are not consistent with the word yet they still believe that they're in a condition to go to heaven and they're not the only way you and I know is individually meet this word meet the holes and let the word tell us where we're going amen hallelujah and so and here's the thing a person in that condition brother Bram says has nothing to judge if you're religious there's no altar there there's nothing for him to judge that's why when they get to heaven he goes to part from me I never knew you amen there's no altar in the heart Oh amen hallelujah amen but see what a what a son or a daughter of God received Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and and is filled with the Holy Spirit then the inner person now has an altar and now your sins are daily judged because what do you do you Oh Lord I'm sorry please forgive me for doing that you go through your day doing that in your devotions you're reading oh god I'm sorry for that your daily judging each yourself that's why communion Amen if you never take communion I doubt if you're a believer I'm sorry Amen if you don't pay your tithe and give your offerings I doubt you're saved because I know unbelievers who do that but see because here's the thing people they want to believe God sent a prophet they want to believe all these things and when it comes to little things then they don't want it brother Brown says it's the little things we leave undone not the big things that we do and so we have to look at when we take communion we have to look into the mirror of God's Word and that's where the issue is amen hallelujah amen I say bring more persecution because I want people to go to heaven and more persecution brings out more of God Amen Alleluia amen but see then then he can say oh I don't you're saying oh god I'm so sorry for doing that he goes okay it's in my sea of forgetfulness amen Galatians 2:20 very familiar Paul says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live I'm alive yet it's not me but Christ who's living in me hallelujah and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so it's not you doing this you didn't even want to come to church amen you didn't even want to live for God but is Christ in you hallelujah and so it takes you and I out of the picture amen Oh hallelujah and so our conscience our memory reason and affection and imagination they're fine until you deny the word then it's not good I know people there they're gifted and and they may have gift of discernment and prophecy and all those things and and there's a lot that are right on them I mean as far as I know these ones where they want to compromise because oh you know well III believe I believe God doesn't God doesn't really care and I'm going okay fine you know uh I'll love you I'll preach to you or are all I'll eat dinner with you but you are an idiot hey man basically you are but see they can't see it because their eyes need ice mmm uh I'm sorry I'm firefighter/paramedic and we just were playing amen I promised my our church that I wouldn't be so plain anymore but see it's good until you deny the word oh brother it's who's who's revelation the word I don't care about brother Paul's revelation I don't care about brother rom Peterson's rich Cobbs I don't care about any of it this is the revelation and if I'm going to preach it it must run from cover to cover it must be congruent it must be right here amen hallelujah and so until so we need to leave those intellectual or emotional things alone until God comes on the altar then God will use whatever he wants to do amen hallelujah look at this when I was young I was involved in musical theater and when we would get all of the choir behind the the screen and we're we're singing these songs I tell you what that is a religious experience if you've been inquired before because it's just oh you're all the voices and it's just taking you away but see what happens at the end you feel cleaned out you do I've been in Broadway meet in I'm not that good Amen but I went to Broadway musicals and sitting there and and the the type of music and in the singing the oh just the harmony and the all those things you're crying or you're laughing Amen it's it's a religious experience amen and so that's why we don't we're not made to touch God with our emotions we're not made to touch God with a brain amen or me to know that we know that we know he's on the inside and whatever comes our way we will take it back to the word we will be victorious through him by the word amen hallelujah see your flesh is made to contact the earth not God hallelujah and so when we come to Christ and we have that token in our life now we contact Christ now he knows who we are we go to the other side you'll say well done my good and faithful servant you received the token and coming to me amen hallelujah that token is independent of your flesh your brain or your emotions amen hallelujah and so our worship is from within a man when I wake up in the morning I'm singing something amen it's in my heart when you you wake up you're singing sup because he is in your heart it comes from within and so that's why on the way to church here you know don't listen to talk radio don't listen to the news amen when you before it when you get up on Sunday morning don't read the newspaper hey man put on good worship music and on the way just talk about the Lord or seeing as a family or a husband and wife create an atmosphere so when you come in here it that half hour before then the Holy Spirit will be able to work and you say well everything happens usually in the after service duh you know why because now you're in the spirits a lot of things could be happening before the preaching of the word amen hallelujah amen that's a no-brainer but see our worship comes from within if you're a church member you have to have outside stimulus to bring you into worship whereas whereas it doesn't matter what it is who knows it could be spoons and it'll start having you clap your hands and reminding you what Jesus Christ has done amen and so God will judge us by our acceptance of Christ on the inner man not in the flesh not in the spirit man he is a free gift and it is so hard to go to hell today it is you it is because if you're not bribed and see where we're out in our churches we want to be that bride and there's foolish virgin and there's others amen and it's hard to go to hell amen but but it's a lot easier just to surrender because when you surrender then he takes over Amen hallelujah and but it takes a revelation of who he is on the inner man and so look at this this is how easy this is when when the Saints pray for you what do you do you say oh god I hope they get please please please lord please heal me please simply move no no you they lay hands upon you if that's what you choose to do and they pray and you agree as touching that you agree with God you agreed with all the others and and you say lord I thank you for healing my body and you walk out and every day you're saying thank you lord thank you lord amen it is no different with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen I'm not preaching see here's here's the razor's edge people preach the Holy Ghost without sensation and that can happen because sensation and emotion are two different things do you realize that sensation emotion two different things amen but brother Branham says I doubt if you're desperate and you want more of God you're gonna say thank you Lord God thank you for the Holy Spirit no you're gonna be snot inand cried oh God or whatever your personality is I meant if you're an introvert you're just gonna be inside go amen so but it's something's gonna happen amen hallelujah but see after you received the finish after you get your hands laid on you and you walk away in faith and so when when you feel that conviction and you or condemnation if you're unsafe and you come and you receive Christ as your Lord and your saving your baptized then you say Lord I'm gonna get that Holy Ghost if it kills me amen and so every day I'm gonna wake up saying thank you Lord for filling me with the Holy Spirit and I'm gonna pray I'm gonna read your word I'm gonna be in that atmosphere and you're gonna all of a sudden one day you're gonna go wait a minute that's not a desire of me anymore that's not a desire of me that's not a desire of me hallelujah and so it's no difference ah hallelujah amen it is simple faith believing what he's already done but see we have to recognize him Amen the people in Jesus had to recognize who he was to them and in our day we have to recognize who we are and who he is to us because we are born of our own free will and when we meet Christ and receive His Word and believe Amen he will absolutely absolutely absolutely fill you with the Holy Ghost he cannot do anything else he's obligated he he's stuck with you I'm serious he is he birthed you you think he's gonna kick you out someone says well Judas remember Judas could not go to the upper room his name was not on the Lamb's Book of Life his name was taken out of the book of life amen hallelujah and so people will stay and receive what the devil tells them oh I hate that good people well I guess my kids are never gonna come they're never gonna be saved then living with this sickness a long time and I guess God wants me sick I just want to say I guess you're gonna live like that the rest of your life then I guess I guess your kids are never gonna come but see they turn down what the word says not because they want to because Laodicea is such a deceptive age and and churches that profess the message we still live under the effect of that there's we don't have this big force field that goes when we start church No amen it's not like that those demonic forces are they go to church with you they they get into everything we do amen but greater is He that is in you that creates the forcefield then he that's trying to deceive you amen they do good people are tricked into thinking that they don't need the token for a sister all you do if you believe that brother Brown is a prophet and that the seals are open you got the Holy Ghost amen your there's some things left out amen hallelujah amen but see they're being told that the token is something or they're being told the token is not something where brother Branham tells us exactly what the token is hallelujah amen and when that happens then the inner man it energizes you and it cleans you out and it supercharges your life amen and you walk around and saying I'm a little Messiah Amen I'm a little God on this earth and Satan get out of my way because greater is He that is in me than he that's in this world amen hallelujah and so this doesn't mean that good people without the Holy Ghost will not receive things from God they do they do all the time and I can rejoice and praise God I'd rather see that and then have a barroom or them being down drinking or smoking dope but and they'll receive many things yet without the token amen but see on the other side people go where's the miracles in the message where is the healings in the message and I'm going are you blind are you ignorant amen we were just speaking of a couple from brother Wendell Martin's Church totally delivered from heroin literally delivered from heroin hey man I was on a call the other day and this woman we'd been on her several times he's an alcohol and and we're trying to get her help and she had a little card from the Mormons on on how to how to be delivered and the other side was Jesus and I said you know I can't say much because I'll get in trouble but I took that turned it over to the side of Jesus I said I used to be an addicted to gambling and alcohol and she goes really she goes well how did you do it and her friend goes did you go to his 12-step program I said no she good she was oh all right amen turned it down because if she would have asked I would have broke the rules and told her more she was that's like saying you know I used to have no arm and I was prayed for and God drew it back and they're going Oh God doesn't do that anymore okay I'm glad he doesn't do it could but he did it for me amen hallelujah and so if God is on the throne then he will feed you on the things of God amen he'll feed you on the things of God amen praise the Lord first John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father's not in him Luke 4 for Luke 4 4 and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God amen and so we don't get to this pick and choose of the message we have to do it all it's better you it's better to do the whole thing and make mistakes we're full of mistakes our flesh is not raptured we're full of mistakes but if our desires have changed then our desires will carry us from glory unto glory under glory under glory amen keep on pushing drink and push drink and push amen hallelujah amen and so the inner man I don't care about flash I don't care about my spirit realm I care about the inner man and so if the inner man is transformed from this world then it doesn't sin anymore when you are transformed you are no longer a sinner you do not sin because faith is at the throne and doubt has been pushed out hallelujah you now have the ability to speak worlds into existence but let's just settle for speaking your home into existence speaking your children into existence speaking your job into existence hallelujah oh yeah when that soul is transformed then it changes everything praise the Lord I like Isaiah 59 19 when the enemy shall come in like a flood some people think that the comma is in a different place and so they like to read it when the enemy shall come in then like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall standard against him shall a man when when this coronavirus comes in like a flood he shall lift the standard of healing up against it amen if and and even if the stock market crashes all he shall if the standard for your retirement for your job amen Oh can you bring up Jeremiah 17 7 and 8 this is one of my favorite new couple scriptures blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope is the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh amen well brother I believe God could do a lot of things well believe this but her leaf shall be green in famine in drought and shall not be careful in the year of drought amen do you know what your chicken still lay eggs whether it's raining or not hallelujah hallelujah neither shall cease from yielding fruit in the time of trouble in the time of doubt your your family will yield fruit amen you was still brother BAM says that you you yield the fruit of the manifested word amen hallelujah you if you time he says he rebukes the devoured hallelujah oh he goes to bat for you he does what he fights your battles hallelujah amen and so if something was wrong a hundred years ago for a Christian to do then it's still wrong today it was a little Amalekite then but now they're full grown still an Amalekite well that little one you could least go over and step on it's still an Amalekite it was in its infancy but Laodicea its full-blown it's it's full-grown hallelujah I I pulled up a video of these southern gospel singers and their fundamentalist they're probably Baptist conservative and I had to shut it right off because they said we're gonna sing these old hymns most of them by Fanny Crosby but we're gonna see him as if they were written in modern times it was blasphemy I shut it off amen but see hey I'm saved I can do anything I want I can make fun of the gospel I can make fun of the word and and I'm good just for the case of entertainment and so good people of this search age have grown into total blindness and they're following God with their flesh and emotions not the soul Oh see we we were Pentecostal growing up and so and and and so I knew that there was living God because I've seen many miracles and and I know that he's real so I know that when we came into the word that the word would be just as real hallelujah but see what happens in churches birds of a feather feather flock together huh why isn't there more people here tonight lazy spirits like to congregate amen I know some people they they do they have legitimate excuses and so but and it church dinners how come all the troublemakers sit together hey Matt we still love them work we have divine love but how come all the like spirits sit together how come the ones that really love God sit together huh because you have fellowship with the spirit you're up amen and so that spirit that you're born of when I when I went to my first message camps I wasn't converted what was I looking for can anybody tell me amen so I'm gonna find the people of the same spirit amen hallelujah that's just the way it is amen and so when you are in church people like to seek out those of like spirits and they and and so it's not right amen and we should be seeking the spirit of Jesus Christ so we can be armed and armed amen in unison in step with the Holy Ghost hallelujah and so just like a young man and a young woman if you have the Holy Spirit then you're gonna seek a man or a woman a mate who has the same spirit amen who is predestinated to doing the will of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah because that's why none of the women were makeup because they don't need it because there's a beauty of holiness amen hallelujah amen there's a beauty on the inside of holiness see the worst spirit whether you're man or woman is fleshly beauty with a manipulating spirit you will bring many people down to hell even when Minister I was in service years ago and the man was young at the time dis black nice hair he is he was a beautiful men and the women come we're coming out of the service Gordon whoo man he's a good-looking man and I'm just going what did he preach on oh I don't know beauty is deceiving amen that's why God made me fat and bald amen hallelujah and so beauty with the manipulating spirits watch it all the father's with daughters watch watch those manipulators amen you sons don't fall for all the pretty face and everything hallelujah and so we know that the entertainment mindset of the world is is because of Flash is because of that spirit realm living and they they once the the churches wants you to tie into the entertainment amen not tie into the Holy Ghost my friend who passed away a while back last year he went to Assemblies of God Church and he told me that they only had one old man that spoke in tongues and he died and nobody speaks in tongues that's the Assemblies of God and he says it's so terrible they put they put a tarp over the baby grand and that and here's blasphemy over the Hammond amen and they brought the youth group out and they're up there and so it's so bad that the older people and he wasn't old but old 40 and up don't even come be at the SOG service because they can't take it they want to hear the word and they want they just want something that is real it's it is so terrible and so brother Branham said that a young person without the Holy Ghost will absolutely go to rock and roll every single time amen and so but when Christ is on the altar of that inner man then your life is controlled by him not you Amen we have a we have a 86 years old he's been an alcoholic all of his life he could prophesy and be a hundred percent correct but beat his wife and drink all the time dad had to bail him out of jail but he called me up the other day I didn't know he's still alive 86 he goes is this Richard calm I said yeah he goes do you still preach the message yes he goes well what's your church service times well he was at home and he he he told me he goes I given up because I couldn't overcome that spirit and he goes I was just gonna live out my days and go to hell but he said he was sitting there and God spoke to him and say how long are you gonna do that how long are you going to try to do it and he goes why don't you let me do it he was delivered right there when he walked into the church he was not the same friend he was not the same spirit Amen because Jesus Christ was now on the throne and so now he gets up and he prays and reads his word now he loves the fellowship of the Saints God has delivered him at 86 years old hallelujah his life God is now teaching him how to be controlled by the move of his Spirit through that word amen and so the things that are important to you and now you and I now are the things of God oh praise the Lord Jesus amen the spirit though the spirit of the world goes after those things that please your flesh amen we've we've had so many over the years leave the church and that's fine that there are free moral agents you know all's you have as a piano and an organ don't got any programs for the kids and I go hmmm but for the Jose he was sitting there in the middle of the service and complete completely deaf in one ear God touched him and healed him yeah I know we sure don't have anything happening you know and and sister so-and-so she was praying and she had asthma and she felt a wind come down through her nose and completely Hillier I guess that's I realize that's not very much we have people their lives are changing but that's not good enough I'm sorry I I know we're we're not that great of a church but see the believer goes after the things that the spirit and the word like amen and so we're at a time where it's just plain talk we're at a time where we know we need to know who we are hallelujah in fact I want again it happened tonight again I wanted to preach this other message but this message just kept it wasn't me I tried to purposely not think of it as and so obviously maybe someone on the internet needs it Hank Amen but see the believer is not lifted up into the presence of God through their emotions amen oh when we were young my dad would preach in black churches as long as the music was going as long as the miracles were happening all they were right there but as soon as all those stopped it's like amen how they did yeah amen you don't have any this or that no no well you must not be a very good church know it that's right just move on down the road and don't bother coming amen but see we're not lifted up into the presence by your emotions you don't come in here and get worked up into worship you come in and now you your spirit that has been rejuvenated it comes and meets the song leader spirit and then you're rejoicing in the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah but it's the Holy Ghost itself that is napping to you praise the Lord Jesus amen see before the Holy Ghost was given in the Old Testament what did they have to do they Elisha said bring me a minstrel he needed worship music to get into the spirit to see visions amen Saul they had to drive out the a cranky spirit by songs amen hallelujah amen yeah amen there's a thing called Christian hate metal do you know what hate medallist it's heavy metal plus and it's like instead of the drumming being normal it's ya boy it looks op - bad day I mean that's real that's a real group of the real song that doesn't that doesn't bring the the holy spirit does it hey hey men see God knew that they needed to mellow the atmosphere and so that's why when we come to church and we sing the the songs of Zion it is mellowing our spirit amen and getting our minds shifted from the day into Jesus Christ so Elijah could see visions his spirit had to be quite 'end amen but today and we know that that presence of God came in so that he could tell Jehoshaphat and they have what the truth was because we are worth trying being we have a flash we have a spirit we have a soul amen and so the that that one that is on the outside it has see taste feel smell hear the one that's next in the spirit has the conscious memory reason infection imagination amen and so that's why we must go past that that's why we must get the Holy Ghost on that inner man amen you are born a sinner you are born with unbelief and you must be converted amen hallelujah Bible says casting down all imagination and every high thing that exalts itself against God hallelujah your thoughts what do you think your feelings amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord Jesus Amen again you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost every day and still go to hell Wow amen look at Simon the sorcerer it said that he was baptized the right way and he believed yet he was still in the gall of bitterness because he said I want to I'm gonna give you money so that I can lay hands on people and then receive the Holy Ghost hallelujah so he believed and was baptized he'd be he would be considered saved in a lot of message churches huh no you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit amen how they do because remember it's one spirit one Lord one baptism hallelujah because what happens is is is that the people begin to take that religious spirit and that's that that's the most demonic spirit of them all hallelujah amen because then it says well this doesn't matter and this doesn't matter but the Holy Spirit when it comes in says Oh Lord this does matter Lord take this out lord thank you that we're doing this right thank you for healing us thank you for giving us these things in our home thank you for changing the atmosphere thank you for doing all these wonderful things in our life hallelujah but see people will only grow as much as what their church believes amen so you want a pastor who's gonna preach the word amen we have to have the word and so if the word is being preached then your belief is gonna be in the word hallelujah amen because the word of the Lord is the absolute it is the ultimate hallelujah but it's still so hard for people to accept it oh oh that's the spirit of Laodicea Amen it makes it so hard for them just to settle in to what it says Amen hallelujah so a person for a person to walk in the life of Jesus Christ in his word you have to be ordained into it because you were with him before the foundation of the world you were a part of him before the world began hallelujah and so now you live above the spirit realm you live above your brain you live above your flesh and you begin to have Christ revealed to you Oh hallelujah aim brother Brown says how we ever gonna see visions and live in his presence if we're still questioning the word doesn't happen people think that we can have little little attitudes towards one another in the church your church can get bigger it can be more prosperous the word can be spoken a hundred cent but brother BAM says you're fooling yourself you died right there you died when your scuffling with one another you died when you have a little a little feeling towards another sister or brother amen your church will never go forward in what God calls important until those things are cleared up I I've been to a huge church amen which will remain unnamed and and one time the person goes yeah there's a lot of us here but we really don't like each other very much it would surprise you that was I don't think I want to go there amen I want to go where people really love one another and we have differences brother sister I don't agree with that one bit but if you have a need if your kids need something I'm gonna help you financially we're gonna gather up the family we're gonna help you amen hallelujah that's what we're looking for and so how are we gonna ever do see God moving in our presence if we're questioning what the word says oh praise the Lord I tell you it's not in these notes but brother Branham said and what I was studying the other night he goes we need to pray the unbelievers out of the congregation I'm going oh man you don't you wouldn't preach that anywhere because we are we're about to find love amen and to those that are pure all things are pure and we want everybody but it comes a time where God says Moses separate yourself Abba Ram amen Dathan Acorah and all his cohorts in the two hundred fifty princes get out of the way hallelujah amen praise the Lord and so we're almost done is that the soul must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so God can change you amen I was a good actor I was a Pharisee amen we we have him you I went to church people thought oh he's a good boy and he's a good kid and and and where I lived for a few years they let me lead a young people's Bible study perfect place for a pervert I believed in miracles I believe brother Branham was a prophet I believe all those things and you let a fox into your henhouse because of lack of discernment amen hallelujah that's why that's why our children spouses are gonna be a revelation amen oh he's in the message oh go ahead sure sure go ahead No oh you're in the message what what do you believe are you converted what are your parents like are they christians are they're believers amen what church do you go to amen but see the soul must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then God will change you praise God you man hallelujah what does it say over here in the Bible it says Jesus says my sheep hear my voice and a voice of a stranger they will not follow and the voice that you hear will express itself through you amen hallelujah when you hear the voice of the word and it says to do something it'll be expressed amen everything that you see in the word you take it you eat it it's Express through you amen how are you because that's the message is the expression and the manifestation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but see again good people living in that second round and they turned down what is important but see the the person living in a converted life will make a lot of mistakes but they can actually save a man praise the Lord I know that I'm not like that oh I've been I've been changed I know that that God is on the throne and the absolute lives within me hallelujah praise the Lord and you're overcoming the world praise the Lord I was with somebody a while back and we're talking good good person but I'm watching because the barista she had kind of a short and I'm purposely watching him he had to take a look and I thought brother there's more than that amen you say well brother richer old no when I was saved God took that from me amen I don't care what anybody thinks God took that from him amen that's why I can live victorious today because the desire had changed and so it manifests it it starts here and manifests hallelujah Amen hallelujah that's why in your business dealings you give the other person a good deal you don't try to take them amen how they do you that's why something transforms you everything becomes different because you're no longer your own you can now brother Branham says that we begin to cope with the word we begin to now that the word is gret is grabbing on to us where we're grappling not not in a fight but it's saying you got to go this way and you're going okay I'll go this way amen it's showing you it's straining you how to how to live in the spirit and the victory of the word and so every little portion of the word you begin to cope with it and cope with it and cope with it amen hallelujah and so whatever you receive from God you realize it's a revelation it's not you you didn't figure it out God figured it out through you and that revelation comes to the soul and it just takes authority over all parts of your flesh all parts of your marriage our marriage is better today than it was the first year and it's gonna be 23 years amen why is that Holy Ghost through a there's been trials for us both in and out of the relationship but never never one time wanted to give up on it because of the Holy Spirit praise God amen and so if we didn't get a chance to experience that but you can drive the stake down and then teach your grandchildren amen or others a great grandchildren or whatever it may be what the Spirit of the Lord says and so here's the great thing is that when once the Holy Spirit is there and it's beginning to train us and teach us and cause us to fall in love with him I tell you what you begin to harmonize with him there's a harmony not in the desert but there's a harmony in you and the Lord amen you become to move as one amen hallelujah I was preaching about we had a bunch of unbelievers because of a wedding and I was saying the he is my husband I'm the wife and the son of the one man come up to him afterwards he goes as your pastor gay and I laughed whatever you think I don't whatever he is the husband we are the wife it becomes a unison an invisible union a harmony becomes you you become one with it Amen oh praise the Lord Jesus amen that's what will happen to you amen it will it will improve your marriage amen it will prove your children it will improve the atmosphere in your home it will improve where you work amen it will do exactly what the word says it will do tonight Jesus Christ is here amen we don't have to wait for the Prophet to come back the pillar of fire is thus saith the Lord it's here right now wait a minute yeah it's here you don't have to be a fit a man we've been in India and people see the pillar of fire in meetings there amen it's it you know why it's there it's because of you it's because of your desires it's because you're crying up to God and he is here tonight in the presence and the fullness of his word to liberate all of us Oh hallelujah amen come on up praise the Lord Jesus I'm done hey I tell you what we serve an awesome God a Living God a man the older I get the better it is amen because he did it he who began a good work will be faithful to complete it amen somebody come and take this pulpit breach amen in that beautiful I tell you my brother and sister I think sometimes we just need to just let go let the word be preached and remember that we are all that the Prophet said we would be amen we are not just a little portion we're not just the leftovers or something we are all amen I was just before the service just studying some thoughts on my iPad there and the prophet of God speaks these words he says that he had to be speaking of Jesus Christ had to be all that the father said he would be and when I read that I thought that is us we have to be all that the father said we would be amen in that wonderful mother J I like to just sing a song old-time religion I'll just turn it over to you brother Jason to sing a song or two amen I just have to say I thoroughly enjoyed that tonight amen now we're not trying to chase anybody out of the church but I say Saints we pray the unbelief out of our church amen now we don't want the people themselves to leave we just want the unbelief that they might immersed in or controlled by we want that gone so that we as believers can operate within the the liberty of the Holy Ghost amen well hallelujah old-time religion maybe that old-time religion gave me that old-time religion and it's good enough for me it's the old-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion gave me that old-time religion gave me that old-time religion and it's good enough for me it will make you stop your life we'll save you and your dying it will start the devil flying and it's good enough for me gave me that old-time religion gave me
