have to admit i had just a wonderful morning amen you know just uh sometimes you're just in that stillness of the early morning um just to be able to just find that quiet time listen for that voice to speak and then we get to rejoice when the voice speaks to us and it changes the whole atmosphere of our day of our life and we appreciate that amen i just want to just take a moment to once again welcome our our brother and sisters from the ukraine now i'm a little confused if it's brother ivan or its brother yannick but um anyway god bless you brother we are so happy to have you with us and um your wife sister olga god bless you what a privilege it is for us although life is starting to get confusing because now we have two nadias and we have two olgas and uh we'll have to be more definitive in in our our expression we also want to uh welcome uh sister thomas mother and sister it won't be very long we'll refer to you as sister thomas mother uh but anyway just so happy to have our sister nina with us and i say god bless you and welcome to all of you and that extension goes right out into the family brother roman it's always a joy i look at him a happy young man amen and just all these things together so i just want to once again mention as it's already been mentioned just lift up sister sarah's family you know things happen suddenly sometimes in life and you know we just have no way to prepare for them but god's already given preparation for us and we want to use that time of preparation correctly and be ready if the lord calls us that quickly and i just want to bring greetings to you from brother marcus and sister martina they send greetings and god's blessings to the church and they just shared that they so enjoyed their wednesday evening with us and i'd have to say we enjoyed our wednesday evening also yeah i i just you know i told him i said you know what you've done brother marcus and he's like well is it okay and i said oh it's okay you've just obligated yourself to come back and uh he says well uh uh okay and so let's just uh put a prayer in that when the season's right that it can come and be here for more than just an evening uh maybe we can get them for a weekend of course he started recounting to me well brother so-and-so wants us to come and brother and so wants us to come and i told him that's good brother but we're the freshest we're we're you know we're on the refresh we've come up at the top of the page and uh but anyway just lovely time lovely people and so we want to have them back before we go into the word how about a fellowship this next sunday i see some heads nodding but i don't hear any amens so is this an amen that's just on the front row or is it collective okay we'll have a fellowship after this coming sunday service and i i was gonna try and hide it but i don't think i'm gonna bother it's a fellowship that we're gonna have to welcome all of those recent additions to the church and hopefully sister april will be here to be welcomed as an addition but um you know she's she's got a lot on her plate you know continuing education and different things that's happening and and she's using this little time that she before she actually starts her actual work uh to catch up some loose ends so just remember her in prayer and let's just stand and let's go right into the word you know i come out this morning and it's just amazing just amazing of everything we talked about in the back room none of it had to do with what i was preaching and i come out to the song that's speaking of surrender and you can see what our thought is today and it's always encouraging to the heart when you walk out and um you hear words whether it's prayers comments songs and you realize this is in the mind of god this is in that vein amen and so we thank the lord for that because nothing better than to be in that vein of fellowship with the lord jesus christ amen let's go to our scripture it's quite lengthy this morning and i say that with a little bit of humor uh to come and this is the basis of our sermon today james the fourth chapter the seventh verse now do you realize saints that a man could preach for months on this little scripture right here he could he could build you might say a whole deal as brother branham said they come to me and ask when are you going to get job off of the ash heap and you know that's how much there is in the word when you start to unfold it amen james the fourth chapter the seventh verse submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you and as in all things saints i encourage you go back read the scripture before this read the scripture after this because you see we never want to just focus on one little narrow view we want to have the whole picture and we joke about how long sometimes some of us can preach but i'm telling you i just heard was it was a wonderful service wednesday night and i just heard brother marcus on the way to church say i'm a very disciplined preacher and i will be done very quickly and then he tells me the joke about i was preaching somewhere and the preacher said preach as long as you want but we shut the lights off at nine and he he's telling this and then he comes to church and then just says did you catch how we use some of that how do i wake you up we're closing no deacon with a stick hitting them in the head we're closing brings them to life he says every time oh my i i just i have to admit that i i just i try not to laugh out loud i don't want to give a bad example as my wife does but uh but it just it just struck me i thought you know we've all had those times we've all had those struggles and but what we want is for the word of god the life of jesus christ to empower us in the good days and the bad days the days we're just full of energy and the days we're wore out we're still sons and daughters of god hallelujah submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you heavenly father we ask for your guidance today may it be your voice father that speaks we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we look at this saints i want to kind of just go through this for just a moment the word submit has quite a few other things concerning documents and proposals and writings and all these kind of things but we come down in the definition and this is off of online webster it says to stop trying to fight or resist something to agree to do or accept something that you've been resisting or opposing you know that really sounds like christians sometimes amen to yield governance or authority uh coming down as an intransitive verb says to yield oneself to the authority or will of another surrender so i love that and it's synonymous with the word yield amen so you look at this and you know it is my brother and sister that we look at this submit yourselves therefore to god now one might say brother brother paul how can i overcome and we see that was poised to brother branham as a question and he he comes and catches that thought and turns it into a sermon and takes that how can i overcome and to a young man and i want just to remember uh logan amen and just remember him in prayer because here's a young man that's in a place that's desiring he's crying out he wants to overcome but he doesn't know how and every time it seems he steps forward something is pushing him back and there's a battle that's taking place and he has become weary in the flesh of fighting the battle and we as believers need to rally together and surround one another in prayer because this is not a battle that we can win on our own but by revelation and i say it's by revelation that we can overcome these battles so we look at this and look in the order that we're looking at this scripture today and it says submit yourselves therefore to god so the very first thing that it's declaring right here is that we need to come in submission to god first amen so people want to overcome but they're not in submission to god so it's there in that realm that it would be and i'll be a little ahead of myself but i feel inspired that this is a place to place part of this my brother and sister we don't want to be found fighting against the will of god we don't want to be found fighting against the plan of god what we want to do is find ourselves in a position of submission that we can then find the authority of the word gives us liberty to take the promise amen and it's there that we look at it in the correct order and you know that we could say i i believe this morning that we can come to a place that we can say from the whole from the heart lord not my will but thy will be done now my brother and sister that's a lot harder than it sounds because you see we have a will you hear parents sometimes say you know it's interesting all of my children are these quiet meek submitting children i can correct etc but and it might be the oldest it might be middle it might be youngest it doesn't matter we're not going to pick on the youngest of course but it's there that you see that that can have a will this seems to be almost contrary until one day as the child is growing someone says oh that reminds me of your aunt or your uncle and you realize hmm so this really was something that was in our family and it just happened to pop up in my children too bad it hadn't been my brother or my sister's children it had to be my child but it's there that you realize now that child is going to come and until that will is submitted to a parent my brother and sister there'll be a constant warfare there'll be a constant friction as it were in the family some children never get over that they grow up to be adults that will not submit to authority in any form or fashion and it's there that it's actually to their own detriment now the world glorifies a rebellious spirit now i want to lay this little groundwork for you the reason the world is glorifying the rebellious spirit is because we're living in the age of rebellion and that spirit is something they identify with whether they really understand they're identifying or not it is the spirit of the age and so we look at this now you can go on on social sites and you can see how it is that there are people ah they're walking down the street i saw some little clip man walking down the street i believe it was in new york city breaking the antenna off of every car that he passed by now tell me my brother and sister that that person is normal no they are acting out a spirit of rebellion and so it's in that realm that it is that we can come and we say well i got saved but my brother and sister just coming to church does not break the spirit of rebellion it is not that we are there and they say well the prophet said this but i don't see it like that now my brother and sister depending on what it was that you're talking about it could be a spirit of rebellion manifesting itself because if the prophet is speaking from the word and you say i don't agree then you are rebelling against the word not the prophet not the preacher not the pastor but you're rebelling against the word and we'll see people who will come and they will disagree as it were now not defending the preacher should we have to defend the preacher no if the preacher is preaching the word you don't have to defend the preacher amen you see now and people will say i disagree if the preacher is a god-called man he's went and done his homework and you say i disagree with him not even knowing that you're actually disagreeing with the word so in that position people think they're just disagreeing with the man up here because they don't like the way he said it the tone of voice or his body stature or whatever it was when he said it and i'm disagreeing with that but what they don't realize is they're actually pushing back against the word good people we're not like turning them into horrible people you know horns and pitchforks good people but that spirit is there and without catching that they will continue to push back at little things in their life that would be good for them so we see this now the submission part comes first and that's where the greatest battle right and the wills that we would have as it were the will of a parent and the will of a child or even as between two uh parents or adults can be a little battle that is there but what we really want to do is come to the place that we can say lord not my will but thy will be done and in that time of making that confession what you don't realize is you're breaking down fortresses you're breaking down those uh places that satan wants to defend you're cutting away the chains and when you do that and you start making the claim lord each and every day lord not my will today not my idea today not my idea concerning this but your will lord is all i really care about and then you'll find that you're tearing down satan's fortress amen you're breaking those chains and satan don't like that so what he's going to do is throw something back at you that it puts it in your face and you it's just oh my goodness saints we i believe we're holy ghost-filled people believing the word of god but you ever notice how you can just go and go and go and go and life is good and then something happens in some old nature some old thing that you recognize as you from way back rares up and sometimes we pop the claws out and amazing how god made a cat he can call come to church he can wrap his arms around you and call you brother he can pat and he can purr and the minute you do one thing he doesn't like right wow lord don't let me be a cat of the message amen oh hallelujah look so we come to the place we can say that and then it's when we're able to submit to the lord submit to god look how this sentence look how this scripture i mean it's tied together it's in this submission then then we can come in the full force of resistance without that submission we don't have the position to resist in people say well i'm doing my very best pastor i'm doing my very best the question is not what are you doing to resist the question is have you submitted the real question is have you said lord thy will be done i put it first lord your will and so it is in that position we see that we can truly resist now look how this goes do you know that the devil doesn't have to look at your doctrine the devil doesn't have to even look at the little nuances of your life people are like well you know if i dress right and i talk right we've seen that happen right for years people came and they they said i'm a part of this and they dressed right and they talked right and they did all these things right but one day they came face to face with something and they said i ain't going no further i don't even believe this anymore you never believed in the beginning there is no any more involved you never believed in the beginning but see god has a way of bringing us down to a time or a place we have to face well i just couldn't agree with the message no what it was is you couldn't bring yourself to look in the mirror and say i'm submitting it's in that time that you've decided your will is greater than god's will and you're going to do what you want to do and my brother and sister it's kind of like opinion we've all got one and we're going to express it whether it's right or it's wrong it's good beneficial or not but we've got to do this because i have this right but you look now my brother and see how this comes about in such a fashion that we can say well you know what uh i i'm doing i'm saying the right things i'm dressing the right way i read my bible and i pray but did you know my brother and sister the devil doesn't have to look at that he just comes over here and looks how submitted you are amen he doesn't have to say i got to sit here in the room when they're studying when they're reading when they're praying and see what they pray and see what they read and see no no all he's got to do is look at the submission in life and when rebellion is obvious and it's out now brother brown said the devil knows you better than you know yourself so when you look at that can can you imagine that's almost a scary thought so the devil can look at us seven sons of maybe it wasn't about what doctrine they had i just put this out for an example maybe it wasn't about what doctrine they held or whatever it was but maybe the whole factor when they went in there to cast that devil out was the fact that their life was not submitted to god and so the devil says these people have no authority to resist me because it's submit or submission first and then comes the authority to resist the devil and without that submission then the devil looks and says they're they're toothless they've got no power to resist me and the seven sons of siva the scripture says come bursting out of the doors almost stripped naked because they had been beaten up and my brother and sister i just want to put it this way because i'm not preaching down to anyone today have you ever went in a situation and felt like you were beaten up when you come out of it i can tell you that i have in my life been in situations where i felt like that me and the devil going head to head that he did everything but hang me from the tree limb and then when it comes revelation and you look back and say you know what i really wasn't submitted to the lord i was doing what i thought i was doing what i felt i was doing what my emotions led me to do which none of those are in the word as commandments for us to be overcomers our emotion will not make us overcomers my brother and sister our opinion will not make us an overcomer all of these things are outside of the word they're not there they're giving us direction to overcome the devil and so it's there that when we come in submission amen and satan starts looking and he says okay they're not submitted they're not going to bring much authority or power against me to overcome in this situation so therefore i don't even have to listen to them but when the devil comes face to face with a son or daughter of god that is submitted to the word of god and satan looks at that and he says all my yes wife sons and daughters of god we don't have to go out here to pray for somebody grab them and shake them around or like a video clip i saw recently where the man just basically picked up about a 90-pound woman threw her on the platform and says we cast satan out and was going to pick her up again but i think it was a deacon there that kind of intervened it's like that's not how we're going to get the devil out we're going to get the devil out when we have come before our lord jesus christ and said lord i want my life i want everything about me every fiber of my being my thoughts my emotion my heart my flesh i want it submitted to you i'm gonna lay it down before you lord and that's when the devil says whoa whoa here's somebody who has unlocked the gate unlocked the door as it were has got into the vault and my i'm gonna do and that's why it doesn't take the aggression it doesn't take loud words it doesn't take force my brother and sister just a still small voice of a bride of christ coming before the throne and saying lord i ask you touch my child lord i ask you to touch this situation and satan says that is a submitted life and he as i'll read to you a little later starts getting ready to leave oh no no another video this one was out when video is all grainy man preacher running around and around the outside walls of a church somebody's like what are you doing he says i'm rounding up the devil i'm sorry my brother and sister we don't got to round up the devil to hurt him out the door what we got to do is get submitted to the lord and then in that submission we can start resisting my my you know that's why the devil's not afraid of most professing christians because there's a lack of sincerity lack of submission we want to do what we want to do and be who we want to be but we want god to work for us no i want to be what he wants me to be and then he promised he would work for me i don't have to come and try and get god to do it when i am what he asked me to be he said he would come and do the work for me in fact he said that's this work i started in you all finish it and this work was not to give us reputation as powerful preachers or powerful this or power for that that reputation my brother and sister is the reputation of a man or a woman who is submitted to god that's the kind of reputation i want may not be known beyond the boundaries of this city and that's all that matters i want to be known to my god hallelujah amen now you look at this spirit of denomination says just follow the church not speaking down on anyone sometimes maybe i get a little aggressive on that but my brother and sister the catholic church will simply tell you follow the church they don't really care what kind of life you have or behavior you have or what you do but they just say follow the church amen the devil says just follow the church he's not afraid of you being in church you think the devil cares that people went to church this morning he doesn't amen but i tell you what my brother and sister the day comes that the word revealed to us comes and it says i want you to follow the leadership of the holy spirit i want you to follow the word when the word is opened up i want you to just follow that i don't need you to debate what language it was in and whether it was a sub dialect because these over here spoke you know this and they spoke in a little different fashion and we're not sure that the words all mean the same and you've got men that have devoted their lives in israel digging and digging and digging to find something to support the way they look at the word and they could spend those years submitting to the word and saying lord lead me to truth then i could do this but you see they want don't know whether it's the high or the low of the dialect well imagine how some of us talk if they wrote our words down y'all what y'all mean and they're trying to discern the word of god by y'all or not and then they wonder why they're no closer to god 40 years later than when they started what they needed to do was submit to the lord and say lord open my eyes open my ears lord reveal yourself to me you see my brother and sister what it comes down to is we have the option to either have the description of jesus christ or to have jesus christ and did you know that they contain technology now that they can project a hologram that is so real that people will walk up and greet it now you wonder where that come from people think they're serving god but it's satan projecting the hologram and they say we're christians too i don't want the description i want christ that's what we want amen so you look for that amen i love how our brother stephen i keep didn't you love didn't you love brother marcus's deal about the chinese and i i had to i had to just really appreciate that they give the real definition to copyright just copy it right amen copy everything just copy it right well look my brother and sister we're not here to do copyright we're not trying to protect the original we just want the original we don't need to protect it we don't need to stop it from doing in fact we want to share the original to everyone we want everyone to have a host of this original word and not not a spirit or form of godliness but to really have christ and brother stephen preaching to us at family camp about being daringly foolish to follow the leadership of the holy ghost my brother and sister i'm telling you that is a very very powerful statement did you realize he put about 50 pounds of tnt behind that when he spoke that to us that's how powerful that is my brother and sister that we could actually become daringly foolish to trust god's word trust the leadership of the holy spirit because when we can come to the place that we can trust him then as we read and as we pray god said i'll lead you and guide you you know this the way i read it do you ever read between the lines and it looks entirely different than what's on the page i look at that when god said hey paul if you will just submit and follow me i already planted this little seed it's so little that you in the flesh cannot even find it but i will finish this seed that i have planted in you and when that seed comes to fruit it's not going to be a five-fold people like i just hope i can just live no my brother and sister i'm going to have a hundred-fold increase the very seed of the life gene of jesus christ and a son or daughter of god is not to be measured in some minute fashion but we should be looking at the amazing grace of god and say i'm gonna be the one who yields a hundred fold because i am a son of god and my god does amazing things amen he does powerful things hallelujah and look let's just share this here and i believe if there was one thing that every person in here would long to see tonight amen how can i overcome how can i overcome brother paul one thing we would long to see tonight would know or truly see the lord jesus appear here at the platform or something in person and that's our greatest anticipation of waiting his coming someday he will return and we will see him i say amen until that time he's with us in spirit form now look my brother and sister i i'm i'm i'm thrilled i'm thrilled if i don't have a case of vertigo and fall off the platform i'll tell you i'm thrilled i'm thrilled that god would love me enough to send his spirit down my way not that we just talk about there's a holy spirit not just somebody professes i've got a holy spirit but god could love me and you so much that he would send the holy spirit our way you know that's christ himself people say well i believe i have the holy spirit knocked like a bow saw no i'm sorry unless you can make a good case before the court for uh you know righteous indignation um spiritual obligation to correct everyone you know unless you can make a superior case it applies to us it's christ himself has come down if we could just catch that my brother and sister and realize that's not religion it's not coming to church and the preacher preaching to us this is jesus christ himself having come down in our midst saying i want to talk to you i want to dwell with you i want to influence your life amen excuse me for getting excited but i've been holding it in for a while amen he's with us in spirit form and he only has hands as we yield our hands he only has eyes as we yield our eyes a voice as we yield our voice to him and we become a complete yielded vessel then the holy spirit speaks through us you want to see the time you want to kick the devil out of the house you want to kick him out of the car you want to kick him out of your life submit amen there's the answer we're like i prayed a lot i studied the message i i this i did that my way we've done everything my brother and sister but submit and what god wants us to do is submit that we can become a complete yielded vessel amen you'll find that as synonymous a synonym is that right a synonym was submitted is yielded one in the same so you want to become a completely submitted vessel well i'll have you to know i'm an american good i'm glad i have to say i was born and raised in this more or less in this valley well actually i guess it was sis wasn't i was born right in the hospital right here old hospital that's gone now but my parents lived on a farm in oregon this has been my world right here and nobody's gonna make me change until the leadership of the holy spirit comes down starts to touch us life gets difficult you know what most of us think the lord's gonna call me into submission to him by making my life all chocolate gravy and biscuits but did you know that god actually turns that completely around and he starts tearing down our stronghold starts tearing down our will starts tearing things down until we come to the place that we might think we're losing our mind and god says don't worry about it i've got you i've got you but we've got to get you to a place you're willing to quit looking at yourself let's take a little poll here this morning how many of you are i can fix it yeah well i'm glad there's no more hands some of you just are simply sitting on your hands and don't want to put out the effort to pull it out and lift it you see you're the worst kind you're the greatest of transgressor no actually you're the one that's going to struggle the most because little things happen in life and your thought is i can fix it oh things are not going so good i guess i need to double down and fix this ah my children aren't behaving right they have kind of spirit of rebellion i i'm going to take away their phone i'm going to take away the computer i'm going to take away this i'm going to take away that you know make them stand at 15 in the corner like they were five-year-olds i'm gonna fix this and then all you do is feed the spirit of rebellion because they're like my parents aren't gonna treat me like this what do we do start with yourself parent submit yourself first because it's in the nature of our young people of our children to look and say i will be or i will not be like my parent amen ever felt like you were the oddball maybe you come from a family of drunks and you want to serve the lord or you come from a family that served the lord and you want to be a drunk how is it you've got to decide where you're submitting to you've got to decide how that's working amen and so as it is that we become a completely yielded vessel then the holy spirit my brother and sister we don't need to quote here krishna we don't need to find advice on some 1-800 number talk to a psychic first 15 minutes is free and it's a hundred dollars a minute after that no we don't need that my brother and sister what we need is a submission amen we've got to come to the place that we say you know what lord i just i just want to do what you want me to do lord i'm willing father if you send me here i go without a question amen oh my brother and sister can you say i want to be completely a yielded vessel today amen that's my heart's desires i was studying this last night this morning it's like lord help me i don't want to just preach this to the church i want to be this i want to be this person that i don't just as a preacher say you need to do this but my heart was crying out lord i need to do this i need to be this man lord let me live by and and be an example amen that somebody say hey he's practicing what he's preaching yeah oh look at this completely yielded vessel what a position of strength what a position of strength my brother and sister to be completely yielded now we're not talking boastful in the flesh but be completely yielded to god and then you get up in the morning and you get to live life to the fullest people are like well i'm afraid of this i'm afraid of that i'm afraid of what's happening in the world my brothers and sisters there's no need to be afraid of that be completely yielded completely yielded i remember years ago there was a little wave went through the countryside and at that time i wasn't i was ministering some but not pastoring the church and it seemed like the the freight loads were going to california all the time i went to los angeles so many times i had the road i could almost drive it in my sleep and going down there and had to had somebody come to me and say brother paul are aren't you afraid of going to california and i was like why would i be my mind's going like are they in forcing some new law is my old truck not going to be good enough to go there what what and they're like no the prophet said california is falling in the ocean and then you should be afraid to go there and i said oh but brother let me tell you something if i'm there when it falls in the ocean i've got a bigger problem than that hallelujah because i'm not afraid of these things that's going on around us amen you know from russia they are one of the the man made a statement america should be afraid of what's coming to it and we have a prophetic word declaring what's coming to america but i'm not afraid because i don't plan on being here because i'll spend my time now submitting to the word of god submitting my life to christ i'll submit myself and when the moment comes and he calls the word home we're thinking he's going to call me home you realize a magnet never picks up aluminum and the holy ghost cannot redeem unbelief the magnet only picks up steel and the word will call the word home and the word that is in us will take us home it ain't going to be how good how much we've given what we've done the kind words we were compassionate none of that will matter it would be the word calling the word home and the word in us is what's going to take us out of here because this flesh has no good deed in it this flesh has no good word in it as far as man is concerned let me clarify that my brother and sister it's the word of god in us when he calls the word home amen the word that's in us takes us home oh can you say thank you lord so you see then it's not how good we were how smart we were how good of works we did how much we did of anything it will be the deposit of the word in us that takes us up out of here oh and i tell you everybody from a phd down to a high school dropout yes thank you lord for including me amen will then have the opportunity to go because it's all about the word not about accomplishments what a position of strength to have every portion of the word of god to back you up i just love that because i don't want to really get up every day to walk through life and to work with a nagging doubt in the back of my mind am i saved well you know the first person to share with you you know who he is the devil's going to say of course you're not saved because if you were saved you would be perfect oh but devil my bible says there's only one perfect one amen and i'm glad that by god's grace by his mercy his life in me brings me to a place i can walk and work and live life with the full confidence of god amen amen isn't it wonderful to live in the will of god amen hallelujah to have a confidence you know my brother and sister we live in a world today right and oftentimes all this stuff is about interest going up and people can't buy houses and people can't this and people can't that and their jobs are hanging by a thread you got to just love the new service i look at it online sometimes not that often because i i just don't want to go through this depression stage after i look at it but they're like everybody's job is at jeopardy and then literally everywhere i go there's a help wanted sign whose voice do we listen to we listen to the voice of those that say well this is not legitimate or do we listen to the holy ghost that said ah don't worry i started to work in you i sent in the excavator and the bulldozer and i took all of the overburden of the things and cares of life and i pushed it off to one side and we'll take that over here in this sea that needs filled up and we'll push it over into the bottom and then you can come now and a liberty and a confidence you can come and say i have been redeemed amen but see if you don't believe you're redeemed you don't believe that that pushed into the sea of god's forgetfulness you still claim it amen my sin my unbelief quit talking the devil's language that never belonged to you it never never never was yours hallelujah amen now look at this to be able to walk to work with confidence that we're in the will of god what a life-changing event that is how it changes our life young people you can go through high school and whatever middle school and high school and whatever in the schools of this world where they teach all kinds of nonsense you can walk through there with a confidence this is not my world i'm a son or daughter of god and that is going to be my position because i have confidence in my god when he said he has washed away my sin when he said i have sealed you to the day of your redemption when i said this work i began i will finish you can walk through that and not waver and the devil would like to come and challenge you well if you're this then you could do this if you're really redeemed you can live any way you want nonsense nonsense that's the devil's religion amen now look my brother and sister you know what's so interesting have you ever watched a man fight as it were against the wind you take two men both ordinary looking maybe a fender bender and they're angry it's your fault one of them's out there he's doing this and the other guy's like wow only two hits one in his face and the other one his head hitting the ground because you got to know how to fight brother jason was auxiliary uh rcmp we don't really like those kind of people but they're necessary no he used to greet me i'd go to canada he'd greet me the next thing i know is like can i have my thumb back but you see my brother and sister we got to know how to fight we don't fight satan's fight satan's way we fight according to the word and when we come according to the word the word says you know what if you'll submit then you'll come to a place in your submission that you don't have to worry about well i don't know if i can deal with the devil face to face yes you can yes you can just submit to the lord and the word that is in deposit in you will then rise up and god will anoint you to have a word have you ever been in that conversation you say well it was so interesting i was at work i was here i was there somebody said something to me i said this i said that and then they're asking a question and next thing i know i was saying things to them i didn't even know i knew that's god doing the fighting for you that's not you shying away because i don't know how to deal with drunks i don't know how to do with people with addictions i don't know how to deal with people with these spirits i don't know how to deal with this or that no the lord in your submission has enabled you now to resist the devil now i want you to just catch this for a moment do you realize that resisting the devil's not always a bloody brawl sometimes it's cunning spirits trying to plant a seed coming to lay a little thought in your mind that they can hopefully water again had a man some time back tried to plant a whole garden in my mind he there saying well you know prophet says this prophet says this prophet says this prophet says that and i thought that's right but the word says now let's take what prophet said and word said you say well they do line up brother paul but not coming out of every man's mouth do they line up that's why i don't care how much you might like brother paul you don't take my word for it that's why you've got to dig deep but it's a lot easier just to believe the preacher really some of them are anointed wolves and sheep clothing titles mean nothing titles mean nothing i am what i live yes someone say amen to that yes i am what i live now look so satan's no longer able to resist the word right now look at this it is we see through the scripture was it gamalia that said hey back off lest you be fight found fighting against god you see what's happening i want you to see how this is satan's anointing in this day it's a spirit of this day a religious spirit where people don't recognize it but literally they've been found fighting against the word of god they're pushing back they're they're in a struggle they're in a resistance against the word and so look at the ultimate coup on satan's part is to get people who want to serve god to fight and push back against the word they say no i love the lord with all of my heart but you see how clever and cunning satan is is they don't even realize he brings us in a position we don't even realize that we are actually pushing against the word of god we're resisting amen the devil says hey i don't need to deceive you you can have all of this message that you want you can have all the church experience you want all the revival you want but as long as you're fighting against the word of god and pushing back and you know oftentimes saints i hope this doesn't offend or hurt anyone often times it might be a hurt it might be a little something from our youth or a circumstance in our life and it's brutally painful for us it's something we don't want to face it's not like we even want to pull it out of the closet or out of the safe to deal with it and so we push back against the word to not have to deal with that when we should come because full submission is us opening our whole life to christ and saying lord take control take control lord i can't do it any longer and to realize that little something a seed planted see how clever and patient satan is there's certain things satan comes it's what the world's doing today i'm not going to go into it but all this perversion they're teaching in school they're planting seeds and a child comes home and says oh mom and dad they were teaching us about this now children that's wrong but the seed has been planted why does the pastor preach so hard he's trying to scorch the earth that that other seed was planted in and then children grow up and say well i don't know why i guess i'm just like i am and this is what i think i am now not realizing it was a devil planted that seed in their childhood and then every commercial every deal i was watching a little documentary the other day and uh in that oh well i hope this doesn't offend anyone and i hope it doesn't hurt the world out there too much you know advertisement two men sitting on a lounge chair on a patio with their arms around each other drinking tea i can assure you i'll never buy that tea if they would spend their advertising dollars on two men hugging each other intimating this this deal as it's okay because something about the tea makes everything better it's a seed and if they're willing to support that well i don't think drink tea anyway but you never know because i said i'd never drink coffee but you see what's happening they've embraced it satan's anointed them they plant the seed for every person who's watching national geographic and you think oh we clicked beyond that our kids no no no no no the devil knows what he's doing we'll give him that much credit he's planting a seed so it's there my brother and sister we do not want to be found fighting against the word of god and you say well brother paul i don't believe i have anything in my life that i'm fighting do you have a rebellious spirit or have a submissive spirit amen does the word have to be preached to you in a certain fashion to make you happy or can it just be preached do you receive it if it hurts or if it makes you shout these are all signs of submission saints should not be able to offend the bride of christ she can take it back to the word and say the word is true then lord help me change me lord now look at this when we are found fighting against the word we have to be really careful about what we say and do remember the prophet of god said don't be found speaking the devil's language and so what we want to do and i say that i support that at all but i want to add or kind of put to this if i could i want to say how about we kind of bring also that let's not do the devil's fighting for him people are like well you know brother so-and-so him and his family they did us wrong 27 and a half years ago and i remember every word of the conversation really 27 and a half year career working for the devil not difference of opinion i'm sorry see we've sugar-coated these things as they're just differences of opinion or a difference of personality no we've been doing the devil's work you've got an axe to grind why don't you grind it and repent with them and put it behind you and then both of you can grow spiritually i don't want to do the devil's fighting for him amen he's even anointing my ipad yeah excuse me now in identified masterpiece look what the prophet of god said he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity he was a lamb the lamb of god the perfect sacrifice there was never nobody lived like him never as nobody since lived like him he was a perfect masterpiece matched god's word exactly god in the beginning gave his word a portion for this part of the time and for that part and for that part this is where men are so deceived and confused today they're trying to build on something that happened 40 50 years ago where that that was give for that age oh now i'll tell you what you want to pick a fight with some people you just quote that and then stand and i encourage you read before and read afterwards i'm not cherry picking this but my brother and sister i'm telling you i'm not looking for something that happened 50 or 60 or 70 years ago because i have a prophetic word that come in this day that said this is the work that god is going to do before the coming of the lord and these things will take place and there'll be a people that will be fulfilling this word and i believe that i am one of those people and so i can't look back do we do away with the message no not long ago i had somebody tell me you are leaving brother branham behind eliezer we're on our honeymoon would you like to live in our tent with us awkward awkward the prophet of god even said that they were a type hey what happened when the work was done the word was given life was meant to be you conceived if the prophet was here today call waiting for your credit card company would seem like nothing compared to trying calling him should i buy a car is it wrong to wear red to church what about this is it evil to drive a black car oh come on if you can ever get brother george to open up he don't usually but he'll tell you some stories that you'd be like no people can't be that stupid oh did i use that word i'm sorry you see i'm actually glad that by the anointing of god's word we've moved on oh some people they won't like this they flinch over this but i'm glad that the revelation that's coming to grace tabernacle is not someone explaining this message to us but it is god himself coming down and speaking lip to ear and speaking to the hearts of sons and daughters of god because this is what he intended for us to come into maturity imagine saints now pardon me i'm not making light of this but imagine if you know all the problems of our life we could pick up a telephone brother branham what should i do i believe he would come to the time he'd tell you go back to the word and pray about it because you've got to come to maturity you can't as a man to his son you cannot constantly go say son here give me the wrenches oh son give me the hammer son give me this son give me that you just stand and watch there comes a season that any man does justice to his son he says son there it is this is a wrench i'll point out you want to take the manifold off you got to start here oh yes you got to start here amen and you got to unloose the things of bondage in your life and then when you go to put it back together don't recycle those parts put new parts in there and if it says to tighten it down to so many foot pounds tighten it to so many foot pounds and if it says do this to bleed it then do that to do it and my brother and sister i'm taking this back to the point it says submit yourself submit yourself don't skip beyond that oh i got a youtube video i've got a preacher in texas that he says god's gonna bless me so i've already ordered my new mercedes and only have 10 bucks in the bank no my god says that you should come to an accounting whether you can afford it or not and then be a good steward of the blessings of god not to live in an image of something else and listen to what the world says but god said i want you to come let me be the center point let me be your leadership and i want you to look to me i want your vision to be me not someone else oh i'll tell you what the problem we have my brother and sister is we get images raised up in our own mind no preachers like nor preacher nobody's like this person nobody's like that where did you leave god where did you leave god oh amen what was it not looking back come on amen this is the same message actually it's not the same message as when the prophet left the scene believe it or not don't want to shake anybody up but it's not the same message when the prophet of god left the scene the prophet himself left the words as a parting gift to us to wait on the lord amen and pray for revelation amen now if he thought all revelation was contained in those sermons those messages that he preached why would he tell us pray for revelation because he knew there was much more coming to us god was going to open it up why because this bride has to come to a place she's a final voice to a final age and you realize we might still be saying prophet said this prophet said that but you realize you catch this saint something's happening maybe you don't even recognize your own vocabulary we're starting to speak of what god has done for us it's not all about looking back god did this for them and for them and for them but we're now able to stand on our own two feet and say god did this for me what is this this is the manifested prophetic message of our day coming forward bringing us to a place we can be the final voice to the final age hallelujah a couple more minutes amen i'll tell you what see what happened two polar opposite opinions in the message prophet of god saying read between the lines and other people saying if you read between the lines you're adding to the word now who are you going to believe my prophet said read between the lines and as i read between the lines the word is just expanding because you see it's the same message my brother and sister but it's manifesting itself today there was a port a point a part of the word that said when you see all these things coming to pass go back through the message prophet of god talking about russia the iron curtain communism all of these things right now saints we could look at that and say oh my but what did he say look out for did he say watch out for the iron curtain no he said watch out for the purple curtain have you heard much from her in the news lately have you ever heard of that phrase called distraction the world's looking for the next nuclear explosion the next conquering army the next collapsing economy now don't misunderstand me my heart goes out and and brother barry's doing a wonderful work and helping and they're now trying to work towards this and our brother sergey is is very much informed helping do certain things but you look at this my brother and sister now it's the coming winter what are we going to do to help the believers and then the whole populous what are we going to do the coming winter and our heart breaks but what you really need to be looking for is that other spirit the one that's going to come in and it's going to conquer souls while they live in comfort while they live in the unity and joy of life and they're there being conquered amen don't be afraid of the one that can take your life yeah don't be afraid of that one be afraid of the one that can take your soul the second death is what we have to worry about hallelujah see what happens is my brother and sister if you submit well it's so hard i'll admit look i'll just sit down right here and just tell you it's it's hard it's hard to submit this will this will of we have that god placed in us you know it just constantly rises up it constantly just shows its face amen so that way i actually say thank you lord because imagine what kind of christians we'd be if we finally conquered everything's underneath my feet i heard some believers once say well it's come down to this movies are good bad and worst i've also had believers tell me can you show me in the scripture definitively where it's wrong for us to drink wine i can show you but you won't believe it because you need something that's got your name on it that's what they mean by definitively you know be like fred don't drink wine but a little wine is good for our belly's sake isn't it we cannot deny that so scripturally you could go home and take a sip of wine and not be out of the will of god except for when you went home the devil was sitting on the chair next to your little cabinet where you kept the wine and i really do need to feel better and if one is good you know the old phrase if one is good two is better and if two is good three is best how slippery the devil is it might be lawful but is it expedient so we come to this place my brother and sister we have to decide do i really need these little things of the flesh to make me happy when god has come and said if i'll submit to his holy spirit that he'll fill all things he will bring me through he will lead me he'll be my comforter he'll be my guide he'll be my everything or i need to just not submit this one little portion of my life one little portion that i i need to just hold back for my own pleasure preach to yourself paul you see what i want this message to be manifested today i don't want us church looking back grace tabernacle don't be looking back we're looking right here to this day and we are looking forward and every promise of the word of god that was meant for the end time was meant for you and i we don't have to go back to find it it's here being manifested right now in our presence amen and people say i don't see it well submit yourself and god will open your eyes so that your eyes will be his eyes or his eyes will be your eyes and hands will be hands and feet will be feet you don't have to go back there to try and recreate something when god said i'm going to make that come to pass in the end time and not in a great man rose up but in you in you hallelujah oh let me hurry along here in the sermon fellowship he says but father god let us in our lifetime so nothing but the genuine seed of god therefore when the spirit comes and falls upon it it may bring forth a copyright the original he says reproduction but if you take the seed from an unhybrid plant and you put it in the ground and it grows again it will be a perfect reproduction give you all agronomy lesson real quick did you realize unfortunately i do grow some hybrid crops i don't feel unmessaged when i do that but did you know that hybrid plants have what they call a regressive gene and if you plant that plant take the seed plant that seed that plant comes to maturity you take that seed plant that seed it comes to maturity every following generation is reverting back to the original not hybrid seed you planted but beyond that regressive the prophet of god says you give enough time this pentecostal church will be worse than the others and i'll just leave it as homework for you to look for yourself the prophet of god coming down hammering on this spirit of denomination and then he said branham tabernacle you're just as bad as they are amen i had to have hurt and even today it probably would hurt some people's feelings but what is it my brother and sister without coming to that place that full surrender complete submission and being filled with the holy ghost we're just a seed regressing the prophet went on to say the lutherans will become back to lutheran wesley back to wesley and that was good let me tie this that was good for those days back there but it won't work today i want overcoming power today i don't want to talk about how luther did what luther did had the courage to go post the thesis on the door my brother and sister i don't want to talk about how john wesley did what john wesley did or anyone else that is there i want to talk about what the holy ghost has done today done in me done in my wife done in my children done in my grandchildren today hallelujah okay let's close this i have i have several more things here amen i want i do want to share hebrews 2 and 11 with you look at this for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren in this interesting that when you become sanctified which we know is not the end but that's when christ puts that mark on you what do we do sons and daughters of god move on something happened come on i don't mean to embarrass anybody or do but it's sometimes as somebody talks about well the old church i remember the old church there was this lady showed up to church there she come sit right on the front row she didn't hide in the back she came right to the front row and by god's grace got to see the holy ghost come down and touch that lady and change her life you don't hear her saying i wish i was back here no sir what i do here is her saying i want more i want more thank you lord for what you've given me but i want more and to get more we have to submit and as we submit god pours in more and as we take the word and act and live the word we suddenly say how can i overcome i think i found a key to overcoming power the prophet of god said just as it was i must decrease that he can increase that was only for them right no it's for us i must decrease you must decrease that he can increase hallelujah oh my can i read one last quote jehovah jireh amen to me it's just an exciting quote i read this oh i don't know it's been back a week week or more ago or something that just struck struck me very much god appeared to abraham as el shaddai for the forgiveness of sins and healing of the body el shaddai the breasted one jesus was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we are healed we can take from either source a little confusing there in a way isn't it but it's telling if you go over here and you make identification with el shaddai you've got the same exact identification as you have with jesus christ not one first part second part third part one bit of no sir it was god it was god you'd be surprised how many people freak out over that we can take from either resource amen oh my when christians begin to get that you guys aren't responding like i want you to what resource prophet of god said you read this bible if you don't see jesus christ in every word okay y'all got your spiritual goggles we put them on amen you know christians have night vision goggles we live in the darkness we're not of the darkness and the light is magnified and we see the light even though satan said if i get it dark enough nobody will be able to see god says i've given them spiritual eyesight i hope this doesn't offend anybody you can take it from either source you want either resource i can take it from here or with the holy ghost anointing i can pick up the message and be blessed this is not a replacement for this but it's a resource that speaks of this breaks this down explains this not like a teacher teaching but by the anointing of revelation making it real to us and we're is that there acceptable analogy el shaddai nothing but god himself jesus christ god himself and so it's there you can take for me the resource and when christians begin to get that right catching a revelation of how this is satan begins to get ready to leave that's why the prophet of god told you pray for revelation because his revelation of this word starts to come into your life and it starts to as it were dominate you starts to change your thinkings change your outlook changes your understanding and it's there satan starts packing up now how fast he packs up is dependent upon how much and how quickly we submit i'm sad to say i view my own life as 21 years plus wasted you say why paul you started serving the lord that 21 years later yes i did but i'm telling you i've held on to a lot of things i've held on to a lot of ideas a lot of spirits a lot of attitudes and some of them rare their head up and i have to say look i thought i buried you and then i have to decide do i go ahead i mean it's kind of a cute little pet after all attitude works in the day and age i'll have you to know i've believed this message for 40 years well how long you been saved that's all that matters the devil's believed for several thousand years and he's still not saved hmm come on that attitude won't do you a bit of good but better to say by the grace of god oh i've got quotes to back this up if you want them by the grace of god by the grace of god i've got nothing to boast of but the grace of almighty god has come and poured his grace out on me time after time year after year it's not me it's the grace of god and all i can say is thank you lord please lord make me a vessel lord that would be worthy for you to come because without that all we have is our attitude and our quotes let me get on sister and if you'll come please when christians begin to get that satan begins to get ready to leave he's finished when people can say i don't care now this is not an attitude of i don't care about nothing there's an attitude in this context no certain healer has to come by oh think about that my brother and sister i need healing and when brother so-and-so comes to our church again i'm going to come up for a healing why why are you waiting you come to the place i don't care any longer god is my god amen and he has called me and he has filled me with his holy spirit he's given me revelation i'm going to claim it any time any place that's necessary no certain healer has to come by no certain this has to happen only thing i want on earth is to hear that god said so that settles it with me then i'll take it and go from right there then you got it amen that's what we need pure unadulterated gospel teaching the church is dying for it that's right you believe that the world is that's right oh let's go on and continue this notice then abraham he was happy about that of course he went on and then we find out that there come a strife between lots herdsmen so forth and i want to show you just a little thing here in the coming of the lord just while we're in tonight i'm not trying to be late and i say amen to that it quickly to my point but watch here just abraham was an heir to the world and lot was a type of the lukewarm believer he was a believer let's get this right lukewarm or not he was a believer [Music] he left his homeland to sojourn with god but always never fully surrendered who are we tonight are we a lot or are we in abraham [Music] and that's the trouble with the full gospel church tonight along with the rest of them is people who left their world keep out of the world they don't want to go gambling and drinking carrying on they're a believer but have never made a complete surrender lord help us saints we can quote bible the message forwards and backwards we can tell you how many decades our family spent in the message and how many siblings and children and grandchildren are in the message and who we know in the message but without a complete surrender you will end up with an address in sodom [Music] you can't break the type of the word could we just stand to our feet this afternoon saints i just i'm not making no altar call but i tell you if god's laid on your heart you say lord i need a i need a closer walk i need to surrender lord maybe we could just close our eyes just lift our hands in our heart and just take a moment just to say lord i i need you to come father anoint me i just i want a complete surrender lord i i don't want to just surrender certain parts of my life certain parts of my family lord i just want to come and just completely surrender myself lord i ask you to come down a little strongholds maybe there's a little something from my youth as a young adult somewhere along the line a little something i i've put off in a corner i've never dealt with it and because of that i can't i can't fully surrender myself i say lord whatever it is today whatever it is today lord jesus no matter how big or small father just ask you to come down let us just surrender it to you let us not walk out of here today lord carrying the burdens the pain the agonies once again to experience the tears [Music] the fears but lord to today completely be able to say lord i just give my all to you i just come and lay it down on your altar lord i lay it down on your throne and lord i'm going to get up and i'm going to walk away knowing that you promised as i leave away from that altar that you would meet me there and you would walk with me you'd guide my life lord i just ask your father and lord as i said this is not an altar call i just know as i studied this sermon my cry for days my cry for days lord even you waking me in the middle of the night how hard it is for this flesh to get out of bed and kneel down before you and just say lord help me help me lord jesus lord let me surrender all that i am let me hold back not even one portion lord i am not ashamed of the gospel i'm not ashamed of what you called me to be i just lift my hands lord before you for a cloud of witnesses lord and i say father i need a greater surrender lord i don't want to be the man who can fix it i don't want to be the man that has an excuse i don't want to be the man that has a reason i want to be the man that is completely surrendered to you today lord lord deal kindly with our hearts lord you know each and every situation each one lord i ask you deal kindly with us [Music] may your holy spirit lord come and may we be daringly foolish to just follow your leadership not questioning not asking for explanation but saying lord you said it i believe it and that settles it oh lord jesus how we love you how we love you lord jesus i just lift my hands i just encourage you saints if you haven't just lift your hands and just speak to the lord our hands lifted are the universal sign
