[0:00] mentally,
[0:07] emotionally, Lord, whatever it may be,
[0:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 13, beginning with
[0:18] verse one. Though I speak with the
[0:21] tongue of men and angels, I'm going to
[0:22] give you my before I go farther here, I
[0:25] want to give you my subject, a title.
[0:31] The Queen
[0:33] Charity.
[0:37] That sounds strange, doesn't it? Sound
[0:38] like I'm calling this queen by a name.
[0:41] Well, it's not a name. It's her
[0:43] position. [snorts]
[0:46] This the queen of Christ of of God.
[0:51] Charity.
[0:55] [snorts]
[0:56] Though I speak with the tongue of men
[0:58] and angels and have not charity,
[1:01] [snorts] I am become as sounding brass
[1:03] or a tinkling symbol. And though I have
[1:06] the gift of prophecy and understand all
[1:09] mysteries and all knowledge and have
[1:12] though I have all faith, see notice the
[1:15] gift can be placed in an individual and
[1:19] not even know the Lord. Did you know
[1:22] that?
[1:23] You know, the first Corinthians said
[1:25] that the prophet said, "I wish that I
[1:26] could say these gifts meant that you had
[1:29] the Holy Ghost, but it's not the
[1:30] evidence." And yet, the gifts are
[1:32] working by the Holy Spirit. They're
[1:34] gifts of the Holy Spirit and God
[1:36] working.
[1:38] Amen. So, we never put we never want to
[1:40] put a an as an evidence or as a as a
[1:44] measure that we have the Holy Ghost in
[1:46] us because we have a gift. I can preach.
[1:49] I can have the gift to preach the gospel
[1:51] anointed like a house of fire and go to
[1:53] hell.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Unless that seed's down in that soul.
[1:58] And when that water of the word for the
[2:00] hour and time goes forth, the Holy
[2:02] Spirit speaking,
[2:04] &gt;&gt; unless that anoints that seed, you won't
[2:07] be there.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Because it has to be the word living.
[2:13] So let's remember that. So it's so
[2:16] though and though I have the gift verse
[2:18] two of prophecy and it's a true gift and
[2:22] understand all mysteries have have
[2:24] knowledge and all knowledge and though I
[2:26] have all faith [snorts] so that I could
[2:29] remove mountains and have not charity I
[2:32] am nothing.
[2:36] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[2:38] the poor and though I give my body to be
[2:41] burned, what my what works?
[2:44] Give my body to burn and bestow my goods
[2:47] to feed the poor. Nothing wrong with
[2:48] that. We all believe in that.
[2:53] And have not charity,
[2:55] it profitth me nothing.
[3:00] [snorts]
[3:01] Charity suffereth long.
[3:04] This is what charity does.
[3:07] Charity is an action.
[3:10] Charity suffereth long and is kind.
[3:12] Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth
[3:16] not itself. Is not puffed up. Does not
[3:20] behave itself unseemingly, seeketh not
[3:23] her own, is not easily provoked, and
[3:26] thinkketh thinkketh no evil. rejoiceth
[3:30] not in iniquity, but rejoicth in the
[3:34] truth. Beareth all things, believeth all
[3:37] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[3:40] things. Charity never faileth.
[3:45] Let's turn to first Corinthians 14.
[3:55] I'm sorry, not 1 Corinthians 14. 1
[3:59] Corinthians 2:14.
[4:01] I had that written down wrong.
[4:04] [clears throat] 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[4:07] verse14.
[4:08] [snorts]
[4:17] I'll start with let well let me I'll
[4:20] read verse 14 and through 16. But the
[4:23] natural man receiveth not the things of
[4:28] the spirit of God, for they are
[4:30] foolishness unto him, neither can he
[4:34] know them because they are spiritually
[4:37] discerned.
[4:40] What's that spiritual discern mean? It
[4:41] means the Holy Ghost that wrote this
[4:43] word has got to be in you discerning it.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without that, you're just a
[4:49] natural man.
[4:52] You're not born again. All right. Then
[4:55] it goes over here to verse 15. But he
[4:58] that is spiritual, see there it is. How
[5:01] what makes you spiritual?
[5:04] Because you feel good, because you have
[5:06] sensations, you can shout, you can cast
[5:08] out devils? No. None of that.
[5:11] Because you have the Holy Ghost that
[5:13] wrote the word in you recognizing the
[5:16] word.
[5:18] Amen.
[5:19] But he that is spiritual judgeth all
[5:22] things. Other words, there's
[5:23] discernment. Yet he himself is judged of
[5:26] no man. [snorts] For who hath known the
[5:30] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[5:33] him? But we have the mind of Christ. Let
[5:37] me read it again. But we have. Is there
[5:40] any we here?
[5:41] &gt;&gt; But we have the mind of Christ.
[5:45] All right. Then I want to take verse 12
[5:47] and 13 of that chapter. Now we have
[5:50] received not the spirit of the world,
[5:53] but the spirit which is of God. That's
[5:55] just what we just read. There's the
[5:57] reason we've received the spirit which
[5:59] is of God that we might know. And that
[6:02] know is not imagined. That no is not I
[6:06] hope so. That no is faith. a revelation
[6:09] of the truth
[6:14] &gt;&gt; that we might know the things that are
[6:17] freely given to us of God.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[6:21] &gt;&gt; Which things also we speak. So there's a
[6:24] speaking. We have a message. Who's the
[6:27] final voice? There's a final voice in
[6:29] the world. Again, the world's going to
[6:31] hear direct from God. Who are they going
[6:32] to hear it from?
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. John, prophesy again.
[6:39] Speak. It's speaking. Prophecy is
[6:41] speaking. Prophesy. The voice is the
[6:44] voice of a of the anointed, vindicated
[6:46] prophet with the message of the hour.
[6:48] The voice is the message of the hour.
[6:50] The voice is God's voice.
[6:54] Which things we speak, not in the words
[6:57] which man's wisdom teacheth,
[7:01] &gt;&gt; but which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
[7:04] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.
[7:07] comparing spiritual things with
[7:10] spiritual.
[7:11] Amen. Search it by the word. Work out
[7:14] your own salvation with fear and
[7:15] trembling. Amen. James chapter 1. And
[7:19] then I'll have you be seated.
[7:22] [snorts]
[7:22] James chapter 1.
[7:29] [snorts]
[7:36] Verse [clears throat] 22.
[7:39] [snorts]
[7:39] But be ye doers
[7:43] of the word and not hearers only,
[7:47] deceiving your own selves. For if we be
[7:51] a hearer of the word and not a doer,
[7:53] it's like a man beholding his natural
[7:56] face.
[7:58] Watch what the natural will do.
[8:00] beholding the natural face in a mirror
[8:03] in a glass
[8:06] [snorts] that's a mirror even can that
[8:09] natural that natural can look in the
[8:11] mirror is he brother Paul's making a
[8:14] point here looking in the mirror he sees
[8:16] himself but what about looking into the
[8:18] mirror of the word not being born again
[8:21] what are you gonna see
[8:24] you're gonna forget
[8:26] because nothing's there to hold you so
[8:29] watch he said, "So he beholdeth himself
[8:32] and goeth his way and straightway
[8:35] forggetth what manner of man he was."
[8:39] What's the word telling you? What manner
[8:41] of man you are.
[8:44] But without the Holy Spirit, you can't
[8:46] discern what the mirror's telling you.
[8:50] And you're going to forget, go away and
[8:51] forget what manner of person you are.
[8:53] But let the Holy Ghost be in there and
[8:55] you see yourself. You're not going to
[8:57] be. Then it goes on to say, "But who so
[9:00] lookth into the perfect law of liberty
[9:03] and continuth therein, he being not a
[9:06] forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
[9:09] work, that man shall be blessed in his
[9:11] deed." God bless his word. You may be
[9:14] seated.
[9:16] [snorts]
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We kind of laid a foundation
[9:20] there. Charity
[9:23] is not a feeling.
[9:26] They can have feeling with it. But
[9:28] charity identified is not a feeling.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Charity is not an imagination or a
[9:34] sensation.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Charity
[9:37] is God himself.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Charity is the person Christ.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; That's what charity is. Charity is a
[9:47] person. Christ is the person Christ.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; That's what charity is. There's no
[9:53] greater. There's no greater than
[9:56] charity. No greater love. No, that
[9:58] cannot fail.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; All right. So, Galatians, let's turn to
[10:04] Galatians. There's scriptures I want you
[10:05] to turn with me and follow. Galatians
[10:09] [snorts]
[10:15] chapter 5.
[10:20] We could read a lot of scripture here,
[10:21] but we're just make hitting the high
[10:23] points. [snorts]
[10:32] Verse [snorts] five, for
[10:34] verse six, excuse me.
[10:37] [snorts]
[10:38] Let's go to verse five. For we through
[10:40] the spirit wait for the hope of
[10:42] righteousness by faith. For in Jesus
[10:47] Christ, neither circumcision avaleth
[10:49] anything, nor uncircumcision,
[10:53] but faith which workketh by love.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So, how does how does love
[11:02] work?
[11:04] &gt;&gt; By faith.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; So, who's faith?
[11:07] &gt;&gt; I'll get into that in just a moment.
[11:10] So we find here in this that royal blood
[11:13] shows itself.
[11:16] The prophet said royal blood
[11:18] &gt;&gt; shows itself. Now we can take that
[11:21] natural and spiritual. What about the
[11:22] spiritual? Royal blood in the natural
[11:25] will show itself.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; You know there's something different
[11:28] about that person. The way they carry
[11:30] themselves, the way they the way they
[11:32] receive the the act they speak,
[11:34] &gt;&gt; their royalty. There's a certain
[11:37] demeanor and a character about a royal
[11:39] individual, a royal person,
[11:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Whether queen, king. Okay. What about
[11:44] the spiritual side of it? Okay. So,
[11:46] royal blood. And there is a royal seed
[11:49] today, which is a royal bride.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that royal blood shows itself.
[11:56] I just read it. How does it show itself?
[11:58] How does that royal blood show itself?
[12:01] By faith. Through love. Or excuse me, by
[12:04] love. through faith because love
[12:08] works
[12:10] &gt;&gt; love faith works by love.
[12:15] So you're going to find that by love.
[12:19] You see we're not talking here again.
[12:21] We're not we're talking about this
[12:23] perfect love we're talking about is love
[12:26] and action.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; It's love and action. It's love
[12:31] projected. Yeah,
[12:33] &gt;&gt; your life is projecting that love. It's
[12:35] love projected.
[12:37] [snorts] This is not an artificial love.
[12:40] This is not, you know, we have an AI
[12:42] everywhere we go. We even have AI
[12:44] animals. Now,
[12:47] &gt;&gt; can you imagine having something you say
[12:49] it loves me and it's artificial? There's
[12:51] a lot of artificial Christians today.
[12:55] There's a lot of artificial love today,
[12:57] too. There's a lot of makeup, workup,
[12:59] and artificial. It's all artificial.
[13:01] It's not genuine. But what we're
[13:03] speaking about here is divine love,
[13:05] perfect love, God's own love in action
[13:08] and projected. This is not an artificial
[13:10] love. It's real and can't a and and
[13:13] can't fail. It's eternal.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; This love we're talking about, this
[13:20] charity is eternal.
[13:24] Amen. It's eternal.
[13:27] Praise be to the Lord. [snorts]
[13:31] And so we we can go over here and we'll
[13:33] find here
[13:35] as I just coming down the line right
[13:38] here. Now I want to go to a a message
[13:40] unveiling of God. He said, "And as a
[13:43] Christian, I'm identified with him."
[13:47] Amen. As a Christian, you've got to have
[13:49] an identification. As a Christian, you
[13:52] are identified. You are either
[13:54] identified with him or not identified.
[13:59] Brother, sister, I believe in feelings,
[14:01] but don't you put any evidence of the
[14:04] Holy Ghost dwelling in you because how
[14:05] you feel.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; I have no confidence in this outer man.
[14:10] We can't have confidence in it. There's
[14:12] got to one one thing we have confidence
[14:14] in, and that's our head, which is the
[14:16] word.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing you can have
[14:18] confidence in in this hour right now.
[14:20] We've got to have the real.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If we have all this
[14:25] artificial AI, artificial this,
[14:27] artificial this, artificial
[14:28] intelligence, then we also have a real
[14:31] intelligence here. Or there could never
[14:33] be an artificial one.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; There could never be an artificial
[14:39] anything without the real.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning was the word and the
[14:44] word was with God and the word was God.
[14:46] That's original. Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; You add to that or take away that
[14:50] original, you have nothing but
[14:52] artificial.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; You have a perversion. You have you have
[14:56] something hybrid. We don't want hybrid.
[15:00] This message is not a hybrid message.
[15:02] This is message has been vindicated by
[15:04] God to be God's own perfect
[15:06] interpretation of the word for this
[15:08] hour. We have we have I could have read
[15:11] further in 1 Corinthians 13. We have the
[15:14] perfect interpretation of the word
[15:16] &gt;&gt; by divine vindication. We don't need an
[15:18] artificial.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; We have the perfect.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; We have the word again.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; This message has restored us back to the
[15:26] original faith to and it restored it
[15:28] back to the original faith. It's got to
[15:30] restore us back to the original love
[15:32] because the capstone upon the body is
[15:35] love and she grows into that stature.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not an artificial put on.
[15:42] It's real.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; This is not an artificial love. It's not
[15:48] even a friendship love. It's it's it's
[15:50] close to a filio. But this is agape
[15:52] love. This is God himself. We're talking
[15:54] about this queen being Christ herself.
[15:57] The word herself. She is
[16:00] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God. He that the Bible
[16:03] said he that is joined and that's in a
[16:05] union. That's a marriage. We know that
[16:07] we're in a union now. We're going to a
[16:10] wedding supper, but the union is now.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; This invisible union is taking place
[16:15] now. It's the word being manifested now.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. She She's coming. She's in her
[16:22] position coming now because the word the
[16:24] seals have been opened that opened the
[16:26] book.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; And when it opened the book, it opened
[16:29] up what was in him all the time as a
[16:31] mystery, as a secret. And when he opened
[16:33] the book, he opened the word in you. So
[16:36] you become the mystery of the book.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So as a Christian,
[16:48] I'm identified with him. Amen. All that
[16:51] he was, I am. I'm quoting by a
[16:54] vindicated prophet here. You either
[16:56] believe him or you don't believe him.
[16:58] There's no reason to take anything else.
[17:00] And don't you dare try to add to what he
[17:02] said and take away what he said.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not talking about the mistakes
[17:08] and I'm not I'm talking about his
[17:09] message. This message was Christ. This
[17:12] message was given to us by God. This
[17:14] message God stretched his tent, went
[17:16] down and took his position in a prophet,
[17:18] put the sword in his hand, and he took
[17:20] the message and opened the book to us.
[17:23] Without that open book, there would
[17:25] never be a meaning of Calvary.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Because without the open book,
[17:32] [snorts]
[17:33] Calvary was in vain. That's right.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; John wept. He knew what Calvary was. He
[17:38] knew. He knew he paid the price. There
[17:40] was a price paid for his redemption. But
[17:43] unless the book was opened and come and
[17:44] claimed what he redeemed. Hallelujah. Do
[17:47] you see the message of the hours
[17:49] claiming what he redeemed? What's it
[17:50] bringing it back to? Himself. Who is he?
[17:53] Charity.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; God help us to see this. It's not up
[18:03] there just something we're saying. This
[18:05] is the truth.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; This is the hour. This is the time.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; My Hallelujah. All right. So, so all
[18:15] that he is, this is the prophecy. All
[18:17] that he was. And I'm not just saying let
[18:20] it be my words, Lord. I'm saying this.
[18:22] This is what I believe. I absolutely
[18:25] have seen it vindicated. I've seen it
[18:27] prove in my life day after day after
[18:29] day. His mercy is new every morning. The
[18:32] word keeps opening so fast I can't keep
[18:34] up with it. But I know that he's here
[18:36] bringing a message to you divinely right
[18:39] now this morning. Bringing it to you.
[18:42] Don't go to sleep. Don't just let's be
[18:44] waking up. Let's be awake.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; We're later down the road you think.
[18:50] Don't play with this anymore. Don't play
[18:52] with this message. Well, I'm a message
[18:53] believer. I go to church. Isn't that
[18:55] enough? No, it's not enough. Amen.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; You've got to have the You've got to
[19:01] have the life of this word living in
[19:03] you. You must be born again. Must
[19:06] underline must.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; And I pray there's still a possibility
[19:10] of bringing someone in anymore because
[19:12] we're we're 60 nearly 63 years down the
[19:16] road since these seals were open.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Just think about that. How far down the
[19:25] road are we? And he thought he thought
[19:28] himself it could be over now. He said
[19:31] the last one could already be in. What
[19:33] about now?
[19:35] &gt;&gt; You may not have an opportunity. This
[19:37] may be your opportunity this morning.
[19:40] This may be the very time you need to
[19:43] make that turn. And if God's calling on
[19:45] you and he's pulling on you, then you
[19:47] need to yield to that call.
[19:52] Don't just sit idly by and think, "Well,
[19:55] I I can say I believe a message. That's
[19:57] all I need to do." It isn't. You've got
[19:59] to have the very literal life of Christ
[20:01] in you.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's going in a
[20:04] rapture. That's the only thing that's
[20:06] going to leave here
[20:08] &gt;&gt; is the bride.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I I may run my nose a little
[20:16] bit here, but
[20:18] we're all kind of getting over
[20:19] something. But I'm thankful for strength
[20:22] that God's given us to be here and to
[20:25] bring the word for this season. What a
[20:27] lovely hour. There's been no greater
[20:29] time than this
[20:31] &gt;&gt; when these secrets have been unsealed.
[20:33] My goodness. And it positionally place
[20:35] the bride. It's awakened her. Do you
[20:38] realize without those seven thunders
[20:40] voicing their voices that was the
[20:42] revelation contained in those seals
[20:44] which is the seventh seal it's a mystery
[20:46] of the seventh seal. Do you realize with
[20:48] realize without that there would be no
[20:51] awakening
[20:53] &gt;&gt; of the bride? None. Brother Brandham
[20:55] said it would take that to awaken her.
[20:57] Let's not downplay when we say seven
[20:59] thunders. Don't you let the devil put a
[21:01] negative in your mind about that.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; It's so simple. You cannot in your
[21:07] intellects figure it out.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; That's how simple it is. God works in
[21:11] simplicity. But it takes the discernment
[21:14] of the Holy Ghost in you to discern the
[21:16] difference.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important. You must
[21:20] have the Holy Ghost.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Not college education, not schooling.
[21:24] YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST. THE DEVIL'S
[21:27] DOING EVERYTHING HE can to throw that
[21:29] that loop in the road, to throw that
[21:31] that that hindrance,
[21:34] &gt;&gt; every way he can.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; I could go back to the word right now
[21:38] and tell you what Paul said a young
[21:40] woman ought to do.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now what it was.
[21:47] Why don't we obey?
[21:50] &gt;&gt; The devil. You want to You want to
[21:52] follow the culture? The culture is not
[21:54] your guide. Amen.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you right now, the
[21:57] culture is not your guide. This word is
[22:00] your guide.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; And there's only salvation in one thing.
[22:03] You can have all of that and and be
[22:05] lost. You can have all of that and
[22:07] you're going to leave it. What are you
[22:08] going to do when your breath can be
[22:10] taken in the next moment? You will never
[22:12] even make it home. Maybe this day.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to scare you. I'm here to
[22:16] bring reality.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; This may be the last message I preach.
[22:20] This may be the last time I speak up
[22:22] here. I don't know. But I know I have to
[22:25] stand and give an answer to what I say.
[22:27] And I'm telling you the truth. You can't
[22:29] be without this. You're lost without
[22:32] this word becoming alive in you.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; When [snorts] I say you're lost, I'm
[22:38] talking about I'm talking about going in
[22:40] a rapture. You're not going to make it.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to be left here for
[22:44] tribulation. And don't you try to say,
[22:46] "Well, if I do good works, I'll get it
[22:48] at the resurrection." And no, that will
[22:49] not work either because those that did
[22:51] the works, those that were good to the
[22:53] bride, those that did helped her, they
[22:56] didn't even know they were doing it.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; But now you're sitting here in the
[23:05] presence of the word and you're being
[23:08] told what you need is not a further
[23:10] education. What you need is a full
[23:12] surrendered life to Jesus Christ
[23:14] &gt;&gt; and do what the word said for you to do.
[23:17] I'm I'm
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; You say that's harsh. That's harsh.
[23:23] Listen, I don't listen. You say, "Well,
[23:25] you offend us." I'm sorry. The word's
[23:27] going to offend somebody.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth because I love
[23:31] you. I don't do it for any other reason.
[23:33] I'm not up here to be somebody. I'm I'm
[23:35] old. I'm about ready to to to go on and
[23:38] meet my loved ones. You think I'm going
[23:41] to stand up here and try to tell you
[23:43] something that I think is not right and
[23:44] have been proven? I've proven it over
[23:46] and over again. You need Christ. You
[23:50] don't need something else. You need
[23:52] Christ and you give your life to him.
[23:54] Surrender your life to him and let him
[23:56] do the leading
[23:58] &gt;&gt; and he'll lead you perfectly. But the
[24:01] devil's got other plans. He's going to
[24:02] throw every distraction he can in your
[24:05] way. And the word's telling you
[24:07] different. You say, "Well, I didn't know
[24:08] that." Then you need to come into the
[24:10] word and find out what he said.
[24:13] Amen.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be without excuse.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he laid everything he can
[24:23] before you to show you the truth.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; And the devil doing everything he can to
[24:28] pull you the other way according to what
[24:29] the culture says, according to what your
[24:31] friends say, according to this and
[24:33] according to that. Listen, brother,
[24:35] sister, it's either the word or nothing.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[24:44] &gt;&gt; I was a young man. God kept me through
[24:47] my teen years. I'll tell you what the
[24:49] keeping power is. I know what the
[24:51] keeping power of the Holy Ghost is.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm telling you as much as I
[24:56] can tell you. You can't miss this. If
[24:59] you do, it's because your fault.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; God didn't make you miss it.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; He's done everything he can to put that
[25:09] in front of you and lay the truth out
[25:10] before you.
[25:13] Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; But you're going to go your own way
[25:16] because it's in your heart to do it.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; So you might as well be real. Be what's
[25:21] in your heart.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Let's not have a put on. There's nothing
[25:26] about hypocrites here. You either have
[25:29] it or you don't have it. And if you have
[25:31] a longing in your heart, then let's
[25:32] yield to it and let God do the
[25:34] leadership and put that word inside of
[25:36] you so that you'll love like he loved,
[25:38] walk like he walked, live like he lived.
[25:42] Amen.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; So, all that he is, I am. Seem like I
[25:53] can't get off that one quote right
[25:54] there. All that he is, I am. Then if
[25:57] he's charity, so am I.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've come to that time.
[26:02] We're at the top of the time. It's
[26:04] charity. The capstone. The capstone is
[26:06] present. The headstone has come. The
[26:08] message is the headstone. uniting with
[26:10] the body.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here. He come exactly what he
[26:18] said, but he come in such simplicity and
[26:20] in a form that people don't understand.
[26:22] He's not known by big shot. He not known
[26:24] by education. He's known by a humble
[26:27] life of humility, something to himself.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "In order to be
[26:32] saved, you got to be able to accept that
[26:33] which you can't explain."
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Brother Brandham
[26:39] said it to be saved, you must be able to
[26:42] accept that which you cannot explain.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; See what the devil's doing? Well, you
[26:49] don't can't explain it. So therefore,
[26:50] you don't have it. That's a lie out of
[26:52] the pits of hell.
[26:56] If it's revealed to you, you can no more
[26:58] give that to anybody, nor can you
[27:00] explain it. But you know individually
[27:02] that you have it, Brother Melo. You've
[27:05] got it.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[27:10] you know it
[27:13] &gt;&gt; and you're willing to share it and
[27:14] you're willing to project it and you're
[27:16] willing to and you're willing to impart
[27:19] it
[27:20] &gt;&gt; and those that have ears to hear will
[27:22] receive it
[27:25] &gt;&gt; if he said there's a bride here today
[27:26] and there is that is the final voice to
[27:29] the final age under her messenger she is
[27:32] the final voice then she's here I don't
[27:35] care what I think about it what you
[27:36] think about it it he's here and that
[27:38] settles it and I know he's here. I see
[27:40] him working in me just exactly according
[27:43] to his word. Something I cannot do.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; He does it.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; This charity is not my works. It's his
[27:50] works. This charity is not projected my
[27:52] projection of myself. It's his
[27:54] projection of himself.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; So all that I am, he was.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:07] All that I am, he was.
[28:11] [snorts]
[28:16] [snorts]
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Being dead in him, we are identified
[28:21] with him. Being dead in him.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; If you're dead in him, you're alive in
[28:26] him. [laughter]
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You've died to yourself.
[28:30] You die every day to yourself. Take up
[28:32] your cross and follow the word.
[28:35] You lay down your own feelings. You lay
[28:36] down your own reasoning. You lay down
[28:38] your own thinking about it and follow
[28:39] the word.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; And well, what about this one thing?
[28:43] What about these? Are they going to be
[28:45] more to you than the headship of Christ?
[28:47] Is that mean more to you what your
[28:49] friends think when they're themselves
[28:51] disappearing right and left when they
[28:53] themselves won't last either? Are you
[28:55] going to put yourself and put your trust
[28:57] in something that is temporal
[29:01] &gt;&gt; other than eternal?
[29:03] If that's your desires, I feel sorry for
[29:06] you.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, there is no way out of
[29:09] this dilemma." I'm sorry. There sure is.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a joy unspeakable and full
[29:15] of glory.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; You don't have to You don't have to walk
[29:19] around in discouragement. There's a
[29:21] there's a healing of discouragement.
[29:23] Amen.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; There's a way out of out of depression.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to live in
[29:31] depression.
[29:32] the word. You start taking God at his
[29:34] word, there is no depression.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Sure, the devil fights against you.
[29:43] What's he fighting against you for?
[29:45] Because he hates the word. He knows if
[29:47] you take your stand on the word, nothing
[29:49] is going to defeat you.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; You're undefeable.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; When the bride realizes who she is and
[29:55] that she can do the greater work, she is
[29:58] an invincible army. You notice I said is
[30:01] NOT WILL BE. SHE IS NOW. I KNOW THERE'S
[30:03] A BRIDE. I am one of them that is
[30:06] invincible. And I cannot being the word
[30:08] be defeated.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about this outer man.
[30:14] I'm talking about that soul inside of me
[30:16] that says yes and amen to the word of
[30:18] God and then controls my m my this body
[30:22] and brings it subject to his word. When
[30:24] I see him bringing me subject to my his
[30:26] word, regardless of what I feel and how
[30:28] I feel and how many mistakes I made,
[30:30] then that's Christ himself. That's love
[30:33] in action.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Being dead in him, we are identified
[30:44] with him. What he is, I am. Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; What he is, I am.
[30:53] That's why I titled this the way I
[30:54] titled it. What he is, I am.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; I'm growing into that stature. So, what
[31:00] he is, I am.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let that be just a superficial.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; It's got to reach in here somewhere.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; If it's not in there, you'll never get
[31:14] it.
[31:17] You say, "Brother David, why are you
[31:18] saying that?" because I know that's
[31:20] true. There's going to be only so many
[31:22] that get it. That's because they have
[31:24] the discerner in them. They're born of
[31:26] the spirit. They were able to be born of
[31:28] the spirit. They were ordained to be
[31:30] born of the spirit. They already were
[31:32] eternal in him before the foundation of
[31:33] the world. They were all exist already
[31:35] existing in him. They were already they
[31:38] were already alive in him.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they come down today and this
[31:43] is your day. And now you are showing him
[31:45] manifest in the flesh again. Jesus
[31:47] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[31:50] forever.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's exactly right.
[31:58] Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; What this nation is, I am. I'm proud to
[32:03] be that. I'm ready to bear shame. I'm
[32:04] ready to bear a reproach to be American.
[32:07] That's right. But I'll double that to
[32:08] Jesus Christ. All that he ever was, I
[32:10] am. I'd like to be identified with him.
[32:13] I'm happy today to be to be one of them.
[32:16] Being identified with the word which is
[32:19] Christ. Identified with him. Being
[32:21] baptized into him. We come we become
[32:24] identified. Identified in his likeness.
[32:26] Identified with his word which is him. I
[32:29] am in Christ. If I'm in Christ, I am his
[32:32] word.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; For he is the word.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that is and he
[32:42] &gt;&gt; that
[32:44] and what he is I am.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Could you compare a Christian today with
[32:49] them Christians of long ago how them
[32:51] disciples walked in the power of the
[32:53] spirit moved by the Holy Ghost?
[32:57] &gt;&gt; You think they moved by the Holy Ghost?
[32:59] It wasn't contrary to their own human
[33:01] thinking. I guarantee it was. It was
[33:03] unusual. It was radical and out of their
[33:05] thinking when it would be and how it
[33:07] would be.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; But they never questioned that word.
[33:10] They knew they knew that. They knew that
[33:12] he was in them. They let go and gave him
[33:15] right away. And they were moved and they
[33:17] were led and directed by the Holy Ghost.
[33:19] I'm telling you right now, that's love
[33:21] in action.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's beyond friendship love. I
[33:27] believe in that. I believe in brotherly
[33:29] love and kindness. That's part of it.
[33:31] That's a part of the growth. But this
[33:32] whole thing has to be capped off and
[33:34] it's capped off by the person of Christ.
[33:37] And that's where the bride is today.
[33:39] That's her position today is charity.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] Now, moved by the
[33:52] Holy Ghost to do it. Moved by the Holy
[33:56] Ghost. Do it. What are we talking about?
[33:58] Be a doer of the word and not a hearer
[34:00] only. They were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[34:02] And as they were moved by the Holy
[34:04] Ghost, they did it.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were his body. He was
[34:08] the head. Whatever he ordained and what
[34:10] he spoke to them, they moved. They did
[34:12] it.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; That's your bride. That's the bride.
[34:15] That's the word living in action today.
[34:18] The bride is the word living.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; The bride is the charity living and in
[34:24] action.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody can read the Bible. Everybody
[34:29] can look at the scriptures. But they but
[34:31] you become the scriptures living.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; You become the thought in the word
[34:37] manifested.
[34:42] [clears throat]
[34:43] &gt;&gt; God expressed his thought. God expressed
[34:45] what he had. In the beginning was his
[34:47] expressed thought that he had in that
[34:49] word of himself. And your himself
[34:52] expressed.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; There's the seals. There's there's the
[34:57] truth.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. That's what's
[35:01] awakened the bride.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; One year later, Brother Bram said,
[35:05] "Nothing to move her, nothing to awaken.
[35:06] They'll take those seven thunders." And
[35:08] one year later, preaching, recognizing
[35:11] your day in his message, he said, "The
[35:13] thing the people aren't getting today,
[35:14] they haven't realized is that they
[35:16] haven't recognized the awakening of the
[35:18] bride."
[35:20] &gt;&gt; What's he telling us? He said, "There's
[35:23] the sealed opening up. The seventh seal
[35:25] opened and revealed. The third pull is
[35:27] the opening of the word. and you're the
[35:29] word that's opened.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; No wonder John got happy. We could go to
[35:35] We could go to Revelations chapter 5
[35:37] right now and see John said everything
[35:39] heard I speaking. Everything heard I
[35:41] giving rejoicing because why? He saw his
[35:44] name as the mystery sealed in the book.
[35:46] He saw his name in that book.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; That ought to set anybody on fire.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's what's the
[35:56] truth
[35:57] &gt;&gt; is that that's where he he saw that. You
[36:00] see? Amen. [snorts]
[36:02] He said he discerned that. He he looked
[36:05] to pass the curtain of time.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; He was able to look past the curtain
[36:09] time. Many today, many hundreds message
[36:13] believers are not able to look past the
[36:15] curtain of time.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Why?
[36:21] When they have such a glorious word
[36:23] because they need. Because the bride is
[36:25] the one that'll be I don't know. I'm not
[36:27] saying who's bride and who isn't. I just
[36:29] know she's a small number.
[36:32] There's a many a good heart, many a good
[36:34] people, sanctified people, blood
[36:36] sanctified people that are going to go
[36:38] through the tribulation
[36:40] and stand someday at the white throne
[36:42] judgment and be judged by their works.
[36:45] You'll never find the bride be standing
[36:47] before the throne in the white throne
[36:49] judgment. She's already judging. Why do
[36:52] you think we speak such truth and such
[36:53] plainness today? Why do you think that
[36:55] so many are offended by the way the
[36:57] bride speaks the word?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not because of how I speak
[37:01] it. It's more than that.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have liked John the Baptist
[37:06] very well. You wouldn't have liked Jesus
[37:07] either when he braided ropes and looked
[37:09] upon him with anger. You wouldn't have
[37:10] liked that either.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; But he spoke the truth. He expressed
[37:14] love. Went through 2,000 of people
[37:16] around a a pond around Lake Ganess. No,
[37:20] it wasn't Lake Ganesser. was um huh yeah
[37:23] pool of Bethesda and bypassed 2,000 or
[37:26] more to one man but he loved brother
[37:30] Bram said that was love expressed.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; What is love expressed? What is that? He
[37:34] said doing the will of the father.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; There it is right there. Regardless of
[37:39] what others think about it, you're so
[37:41] you're so tapped in. You're so united
[37:43] with that word that you don't care what
[37:45] they think about it. You'll do what the
[37:47] Holy Spirit said do and you won't move
[37:49] until it moves you.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; It's no figuring any of it out. It's a
[37:55] love affair, brother, sister. It's a
[37:56] love affair. He's pouring himself into
[37:58] the He's pouring himself into you.
[38:00] That's what the message was about.
[38:02] That's what the seventh seal was about.
[38:04] Pouring himself into her. They are
[38:06] becoming one for the wedding supper.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] That's exactly. They're becoming one,
[38:17] brother, sister. They're becoming one.
[38:18] Do you realize that this bride is going
[38:21] to disappear and you may be left here?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; You wonder why God is so so adamant on
[38:28] getting you to realize there's no chance
[38:30] of surviving. There's no chance of s of
[38:33] going home without having this word
[38:36] inside of you.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you have a pull for that,
[38:40] then if I know this, if you have a
[38:42] genuine deep calling to that deep,
[38:44] there's a deep to respond. And a deep's
[38:46] responding to you this morning. And if
[38:48] you have that, you're going to respond.
[38:49] I guarantee it. If that seeds inside of
[38:51] you, you going to respond to the word.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; If it's not, you can I can say all I
[38:56] want to say. Every preacher can say what
[38:58] they want to say. The message could say
[39:00] you'll never see it.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to discourage you. I'm here
[39:04] to tell you the truth.
[39:06] So, it depends on what's in your soul
[39:09] right now.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; We're too late to play games with this
[39:14] anymore.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; This is not playing church.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; This is a house of correction.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; What is the house of correction? What is
[39:24] correction? True, genuine, godly
[39:26] correction is charity.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; It's the love of God correcting.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it sounds harsh. I I
[39:34] know you don't have love because the way
[39:35] you sound. That's a bunch of nonsense
[39:37] and a lie of the devil.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; You go back and see what my life is
[39:43] living. What of the fruit am I bearing?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; That's how you judge them by their
[39:51] fruit. Judas was a devil and anointed of
[39:54] the Holy Ghost and cast out devils
[39:56] operated by faith and had the power of
[39:58] God anointing him.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; A genuine Holy Spirit. Capifas also
[40:02] balam also.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And a devil.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; So it's going to take more than and I
[40:11] believe in all. I believe in shouting. I
[40:13] believe in casting out devil. I believe
[40:14] it because it's a Holy Ghost work. But
[40:16] you can have all of that as I said
[40:18] before and miss the rapture.
[40:21] Because unless that seeds down in your
[40:23] soul when you hear this word, there's
[40:25] going to be something take place inside
[40:27] of you that you can't suppress, you
[40:29] can't repress. It's going to come forth.
[40:32] It'll stay with you until you fully
[40:34] completely let go and surrender to Jesus
[40:36] Christ.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; So, you might as well just quit fighting
[40:42] it and say, "Lord, I need you." Let's
[40:45] get alone with him and start feeding on
[40:47] the word. Start feeding on the open book
[40:50] and let it become you because you're
[40:51] going to become what you eat on.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; If you want to be the word living, start
[40:58] eating the word.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, you'll face tests. You'll face
[41:06] trials. Nobody will agree. You're going
[41:08] to the people are going to come against
[41:09] you and all these things. But what
[41:11] difference does that make? Eternal life
[41:12] is way above that. Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "These seals
[41:15] opening this book opening up right now."
[41:17] See, when he opened the book, he opened
[41:19] who I am.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; I couldn't see that until fully until
[41:25] then because the bride is the full
[41:27] manifestation, the full revelation of
[41:28] Jesus Christ.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; She's the mystery of God revealed. She's
[41:34] the mystery of God, finished mystery of
[41:36] God.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what she is. And we
[41:43] ought to be submitting ourselves
[41:44] entirely to that. And if you've got
[41:46] things out there that's taking your
[41:48] taking place of that, don't you let an
[41:50] idol come in your life.
[41:52] I don't care how important. I don't care
[41:54] what it is. If it takes this position
[41:56] and takes you away from that word and
[41:58] sits there between you and going further
[42:00] in that word, then brother, sister, it's
[42:02] an idol and it's an idolatrous spirit
[42:04] and you need to be free of it.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you have, how much
[42:09] education you've got, or anything else.
[42:13] That will never put you in the rapture.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; That will absolutely keep you out of it.
[42:18] Actually,
[42:20] &gt;&gt; you put your trust in that, you'll never
[42:22] go anywhere.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Only further in the ditch,
[42:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And probably get more religious all the
[42:29] time
[42:31] because you're doing good works.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, what we've got is
[42:37] beyond
[42:38] &gt;&gt; good works. It's a genuine faith and
[42:41] works follow that.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Faith without works is dead. You can
[42:51] have all those works and no faith. It's
[42:53] still dead.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; But you can have all faith as a natural
[42:58] man, be anointed of the genuine Holy
[43:00] Ghost, and have all faith. But I'm
[43:02] telling you, are you able to hear and
[43:04] receive the word for the season? Is it
[43:06] becoming genuinely a revelation to you?
[43:09] There's your evidence.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:20] [clears throat]
[43:21] &gt;&gt; My I hardly got started.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so [snorts]
[43:26] wouldn't you like to see they the move
[43:29] by the Holy Ghost? They just did it. A
[43:31] prisoner. As I preached the other night,
[43:33] a prisoner. How many prisoners? See,
[43:35] that's what you got to become as a
[43:36] prisoner. You must become a prisoner.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Prison to everything else and alone with
[43:42] Jesus Christ. A prisoner to him.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the pull this side and the
[43:47] pull this side and the pull that side
[43:48] and how much this pulls on you and how
[43:50] much a prisoner to him Lord is this your
[43:53] perfect, not your permissive, your
[43:56] perfect will, which is his word, which
[43:58] is the message of the hour.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; You can't divide the message of the hour
[44:03] from the word. And don't you let anybody
[44:05] try to do it.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; You can't add to this. The prophet said,
[44:11] "Don't you go out and add to what I've
[44:12] said or take away." That's his word.
[44:15] Don't you add to it and take away.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Another place you want me to hear
[44:20] something real strict, too. He said, "If
[44:23] you can't understand what I'm saying,
[44:24] just take what I say. God will hold me
[44:26] responsible for it."
[44:32] I'm sorry, but it is absolute. The word
[44:34] and the message are absolutely one.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; You cannot divide them. And how dare
[44:41] anybody would come along and try to
[44:43] divide that.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; They don't have discernment.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; They're lacking discernment.
[44:54] [snorts]
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:57] All right, watch what else he said. Just
[44:59] a prisoner to the word and the will of
[45:01] God. A prisoner to the word, which is
[45:03] the will of God. He couldn't even move
[45:06] an individual. See, it's an individual
[45:07] affair, brother, sister. It's not this
[45:09] group, that group, another group. It's
[45:11] an individual affair.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; You just be you just be a good hearer of
[45:18] the word and let God take care of the
[45:19] rest of it. He'll have you be right
[45:21] where you should be. He'll have a woman
[45:23] in her place where she should be and a
[45:24] man in his place where he should be. And
[45:26] you'll be carrying out what he called
[45:28] you to carry out.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; You get yourself united with him and let
[45:33] him do the work. He can't take you away
[45:35] from the word. He's not going to take
[45:37] you away from this message. He's not
[45:39] going to take you out of that. He'll
[45:41] bring you in it. He'll lead you into all
[45:43] truth. And if you don't see him leading
[45:46] you to all truth, something is wrong.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. For when he, the Spirit of truth,
[45:53] has come, he will lead you into all,
[45:55] guide you into all truth.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] [clears throat]
[46:06] &gt;&gt; You can't even move until God moved you.
[46:09] Wouldn't you like to see a church rise
[46:11] like that? It's going to It's going
[46:14] back.
[46:16] Anybody have the time? What time is it?
[46:20] Okay. Hey, no one wants to tell me. You
[46:22] got to watch on. What time is it?
[46:28] Okay,
[46:29] I'll keep going then
[46:32] cuz I don't have it either. So, and this
[46:35] screen's down. So, thanks be to the
[46:37] Lord. All right,
[46:40] then. Wouldn't you like to see a church
[46:43] rise like that? It's going to
[46:46] back.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; How many's going back?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] How many's going back?
[46:57] &gt;&gt; How many's going back
[47:00] &gt;&gt; to the truth? Going back to the word.
[47:03] Going back.
[47:05] Amen. Back to where? I'm not talking
[47:07] about going back. To go back is go
[47:09] forward.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] But he said it's got
[47:14] to come. Other words, he said it's on
[47:16] its road. It's going to it's going back
[47:21] back to what? The original faith,
[47:23] &gt;&gt; the original word, the original person,
[47:25] the original love.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts]
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Now, it's got to come. It's on its road
[47:36] now.
[47:38] Yes, it is. And it has. And it is. And
[47:40] here she is today. I believe that with
[47:43] all my heart. You'd realize that this
[47:45] bride is the manifestation of the
[47:47] message. The manifestation exactly the
[47:50] manifestation of Christ in another form.
[47:53] You realize this is the bride coming of
[47:55] Christ. Do you realize your day and what
[47:57] he said would be here and how he would
[48:00] return? The mystery of how he would
[48:02] return.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ the mystery of God revealed
[48:07] of how it's only revealed to the bride.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Here's the secret. Why? Here's the
[48:12] secret. The word is in the bride.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Bearing life.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Now it's got to come now. He knew who he
[48:26] was. Now look at how he turns right back
[48:28] around. Now it's on its road. Now see,
[48:31] he knew who he was. And there's a bride
[48:35] knowing who she is.
[48:37] I know
[48:40] who I am.
[48:41] That's why there's no fear. It removes
[48:44] every bit of fear. When you know who you
[48:46] are, how you going to be moved off of
[48:48] him? How you going to be defeated? How
[48:50] you going to be how you going to be not?
[48:52] How you not going to make it
[48:55] &gt;&gt; when you know who you are?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; It's not a showmanship.
[49:00] It's a genuine humility in walking with
[49:03] God every day
[49:05] &gt;&gt; in unity with him in in love with him in
[49:08] in absolutely in divine oneness.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; No longer twain. What God hath joined
[49:15] together let no man put us under.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; God's put this together. Amen. See
[49:20] Matthew 16. If he see he was standing.
[49:23] Now turn to Matthew 16. Now see he knew
[49:27] who he was. Therefore he had faith. his
[49:29] faith could produce when he knowed what
[49:32] he was.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] Now, if you abide in me and my word
[49:38] abides in you, then you know who you
[49:40] are.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; There it is. Let me say that again. If
[49:45] you abide in me and my word abides in
[49:47] you, then you know who you are.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; It's not just a hope. So, it's a
[49:52] revelation to an individual.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] Matthew 16.
[50:00] very familiar scripture.
[50:03] [snorts]
[50:07] Verse 18, he's speaking to Peter. He
[50:10] said, "Who do men say that I am?" And
[50:12] Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the
[50:13] son of the living God." He said, "Flesh
[50:15] and blood never revealed this to you,
[50:17] but my father which is in heaven." 18th
[50:19] verse. I want to show you something
[50:20] here. And I say unto thee that thou art
[50:23] Peter
[50:25] and upon this rock, that rock is
[50:29] revelation of who Jesus Christ is.
[50:32] [snorts]
[50:32] So upon that rock, notice rock
[50:35] represents revelation.
[50:38] And upon that rock, I'll build my
[50:41] church. Other words, upon this
[50:43] foundation of the revelation of who I
[50:45] am, I'm going to build my church.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing it?
[50:51] Amen. Amen. [snorts]
[50:55] [clears throat]
[50:58] I don't know what happened to my
[50:59] handkerchief.
[51:02] Okay, I [snorts] guess. Don't need it.
[51:05] Oh, there it is. All right. One of those
[51:08] pockets.
[51:10] Okay,
[51:11] [snorts]
[51:13] let me say it again. Upon this rock,
[51:16] what was he? the cornerstone.
[51:20] He was the cornerstone. Are you with me?
[51:23] &gt;&gt; He was the head of the He was the
[51:25] corner.
[51:27] And they rejected the corner. But the
[51:29] bride's not going to reject it. He said,
[51:30] "I'll build my church upon this
[51:32] foundation."
[51:35] Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[51:39] and [snorts] the gates of hell shall not
[51:41] prevail against it. Now, where's your
[51:44] rest, bride?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, if she's growing and the and
[51:48] watch what now, let's go to Peter. Let's
[51:51] go to first Peter 2. [snorts]
[51:56] 1 Peter 2.
[52:00] Let's [clears throat] begin with the
[52:01] sixth verse. You could read it all.
[52:04] Wherefore, it is also contained in the
[52:06] scripture. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief
[52:10] cornerstone, elect, precious, and he
[52:14] that believeth on him shall not be
[52:16] confounded.
[52:19] He that has the revelation,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; he that's got the real faith
[52:27] &gt;&gt; upon this revelation, upon this
[52:29] foundation, upon this cornerstone, I
[52:31] will build my church. And I'm telling
[52:34] you right now, if he's building his
[52:35] church upon that foundation, what will
[52:37] she be?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Who will she be?
[52:44] Amen. All right. Now, watch. He said
[52:46] here verse seven, "And and not be
[52:49] confounded. Unto you therefore which
[52:51] believe, believe." Real revelation which
[52:54] you believe, real faith, he is precious.
[52:57] But unto them which be disobedient, the
[53:00] stone which the builders disallowed.
[53:02] Just what I said, the same is made the
[53:04] head. Now they made the head of the
[53:06] corner.
[53:08] Amen. Are you with me? They left it. But
[53:11] but to you that believe upon this
[53:13] church, I'll build my church upon the
[53:16] revelation of who I am. I'm going to
[53:19] build that church. And there's no other
[53:21] foundation laid but me. And that and
[53:23] that's it. On that revelation. But now
[53:26] it's turned from the corner. Now what's
[53:28] happened? Now a corner's turned. Now
[53:30] there's been a turn. Now the headstones
[53:32] appeared.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Now what about it? Now he is precious.
[53:39] See, but to them that are the this which
[53:42] are not which are disobedient
[53:43] disobedient to what? word which the
[53:46] which the stone which the builder
[53:47] disallowed the same that same stone has
[53:49] be has been made the head of the corner
[53:51] and a stone of stumbling and a rock a
[53:54] revelation of offense.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Think of that even to them which stumble
[54:00] at the word. It's a it's an offense to
[54:03] them. They stumble at the word and they
[54:05] don't like this kind of preaching and
[54:07] they don't like the preaching that that
[54:09] brings down the revelation of the hour.
[54:11] They have to find fault with it. It's
[54:13] too deep. It's too deep. It's not
[54:14] simple. That's another lie of the devil.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Because it is simple and it's not
[54:20] something made up. It's so it's so
[54:23] simple when it's revealed to you, you
[54:25] can't see it any other way but said,
[54:26] "How did I miss this?" You missed it
[54:28] because in your carnality, you couldn't
[54:30] figure it out.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; You couldn't you couldn't get it.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You can't become that simple.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I wish I could drive that home.
[54:42] Amen. This is not something that's
[54:45] outlandish and out of it is to your
[54:47] mind, but not to the soul realm. If that
[54:50] word's in there, it's food. It's due
[54:53] season. It's food in due It's spiritual
[54:56] food in due season.
[55:00] [clears throat]
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; So he said, now so a rock of offense to
[55:04] them which stumble at the word. It's a
[55:05] rock of offense being disobedient
[55:08] wherein to also they were appointed.
[55:10] They were appointed to that place. They
[55:12] were appointed to be offended. They were
[55:14] appointed. Here's the headstone. Brother
[55:16] Brandham, Brother Brandham said this. He
[55:18] said, he said,
[55:21] "This is the head time." Christ the
[55:24] headstone comes to the body. This is the
[55:28] head time.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; All right. So he said, "Now verse nine,
[55:35] but you
[55:39] &gt;&gt; they're offended, but you
[55:41] &gt;&gt; that have the revelation that I built my
[55:43] church on. But you that are built up and
[55:46] now capped off by the headstone, the
[55:48] message of the seventh angel that is
[55:50] capped, the opening of the of the
[55:52] opening of the book, the opening of the
[55:53] of the of the sealed mystery of the
[55:56] opening of the mystery to you. You are
[55:58] what? a chosen generation,
[56:02] [snorts]
[56:02] &gt;&gt; a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[56:05] peculiar people, that you should show
[56:08] forth the praises of him who hath called
[56:11] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[56:15] light. Amen. Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; All right. So [snorts] when a man lives
[56:24] by faith and walks by faith, I mean
[56:28] substance faith, he is isolated from the
[56:31] entire world and becomes a new creature
[56:33] in Christ. There now you're getting into
[56:35] bride material.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] See, see you're getting into rapturing
[56:42] conditions now.
[56:45] What we're speaking about now that means
[56:48] for each one of us, not just the pastor,
[56:50] the deacons, trustees. That means for
[56:52] you, the leoty, every individual walks
[56:55] in a world with God alone. You're
[56:57] baptized into his kingdom and there's
[56:59] nobody in there but you and God.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; See, he gives the orders and you pack
[57:06] them out.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; You pack them out. See, the head and the
[57:16] body are one.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; What are you packing out, Charity?
[57:23] Love.
[57:25] What are you imparting? Love.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Life.
[57:29] Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The revelation of life is light.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. When light is manifest, his light
[57:36] is manifested. His life is manifest.
[57:38] Excuse me. It's light.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; You're imparting light upon darkness,
[57:44] exposing the darkness. If you're not a
[57:47] real believer, you don't like that.
[57:49] But if you are a real believer and
[57:51] you've done something you shouldn't have
[57:52] done and and God puts that light on it,
[57:55] you say, "Thank you, Lord. I needed
[57:57] that. I c that's correction
[57:59] &gt;&gt; by love."
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. By love. [snorts]
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody but you and God in
[58:06] there. You pack them out the orders and
[58:08] there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere.
[58:10] You walk right on. If the Lord says
[58:12] this, there's nobody in the world can
[58:13] talk you out of it. You go right on just
[58:16] the same. Now you're coming into a
[58:18] perfect faith. Hear me. Now you're
[58:20] coming into perfect faith. And you can't
[58:23] have perfect love without perfect faith.
[58:25] They go hand in hand. You cannot have
[58:27] one without the other. And the believer,
[58:30] the real bride is the faith of God that
[58:33] moves in you. That's a direct quote.
[58:36] Page 68 out of perfect faith. A real
[58:39] believer, the bride of Jesus Christ is
[58:41] the faith is the substance is the
[58:44] revelation of God.
[58:46] Psalm 62 said, David said, "God is my
[58:49] revelation."
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; See why the bride's so peculiar? You see
[58:57] why she peculiar people? A royal
[59:00] priesthood.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; She lives another life. It's not common.
[59:04] It's not It's uncommon to the world.
[59:07] Getting more radical all the time in
[59:09] their sight.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; But it's food. It's life. It's light.
[59:16] It's joy unspeakable.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; To the bride.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; AI said, "Now you're coming into perfect
[59:25] faith. You're coming into bride
[59:27] material. You're getting rapture
[59:28] condition. You're coming into perfect
[59:30] faith. Perfect perfection that can not
[59:34] fail."
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to know who
[59:40] you are.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot fail. That faith, that faith,
[59:45] that's who I am. That faith, that faith
[59:49] never fails.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That faith never fails. Love never
[59:56] fails. Charity never fails.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see who she is?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; She's himself.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Not God walking next to me. I can't. Do
[1:00:07] I hear? He's in me. I'm in him.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; It's a union.
[1:00:12] Hallelujah.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; When you see her, you see him. When you
[1:00:15] see him, you see her.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; See, bearing the same life, the same
[1:00:23] character, the same
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; spirit. Got it.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm trying to find a place
[1:00:30] to stop here. I, as I said, I just have
[1:00:32] to carry this on again. But, but
[1:00:37] it [snorts] cannot fail. Perfect faith.
[1:00:40] with that perfect faith. He was a mystic
[1:00:42] to them with his perfect faith. And so
[1:00:44] is it now with those who have perfect
[1:00:45] faith are a mystic to others. You know
[1:00:48] what a mystic means? A mystery. They're
[1:00:51] a mystery to others. Now, what is he? He
[1:00:53] has gone off the deep end. He's so
[1:00:55] radical. You know what he's telling us
[1:00:57] now? We don't need all these other
[1:00:59] things. We just need we need the word.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; You're right. Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] You need that. Then if he appoints other
[1:01:11] things, then do it according to what he
[1:01:13] said, not what you think, not what you
[1:01:16] feel, not what the culture tells you.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Go back to Timothy. Go back. Go back to
[1:01:23] Peter and find out what what Peter said
[1:01:25] about,
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; what Peter said about young people,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; what Timothy said,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; what what what Paul said,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; told Timothy, and [snorts] then line up
[1:01:38] with it.
[1:01:39] If you can't line up with that word,
[1:01:41] even one little iota, you're no better
[1:01:43] than even the beginning.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Quit putting your reasoning to the word.
[1:01:49] Quit letting the devil put the reasoning
[1:01:51] to the word.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Take him at his word. Who's going to
[1:01:54] who's going to come down the line in
[1:01:56] some place and say, "I'll take God at
[1:01:57] his word."
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, there's not very
[1:02:03] many of us.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's truth.
[1:02:07] I know they're there, but there's not
[1:02:08] many of us comparably.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; 8 to one.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Think of that. Talking about the
[1:02:16] beginning.
[1:02:18] How many was there Enoch? I I know
[1:02:19] there's more than that, but look how the
[1:02:21] difference is.
[1:02:24] Elijah thought he was the only one. He
[1:02:26] said 7,000 that haven't bowed their knee
[1:02:28] out of millions.
[1:02:30] How many knew Jesus was on earth when he
[1:02:32] was here? How many received him then?
[1:02:35] There was billions of people on earth at
[1:02:37] that time. Hardly not everyone even in
[1:02:40] in Israel even knew he existed.
[1:02:44] But who'd he come to? His own.
[1:02:49] And those that gladly heard him and
[1:02:50] received him. See what did what did the
[1:02:53] prophet say here? Watch what he says
[1:02:54] here. And I I'm trying to close. He says
[1:02:56] here
[1:02:59] [clears throat]
[1:03:00] [snorts]
[1:03:08] now [snorts] just a moment here. Thought
[1:03:10] I had it right here.
[1:03:25] Well,
[1:03:26] oh yeah, for seal. And I think any
[1:03:29] bornag again Christian
[1:03:32] is kind of an oddball to the world
[1:03:35] because you've been changed.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been changed.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; You're not living by this outer man
[1:03:43] anymore. You're living from the inside
[1:03:45] out.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; If there's not a change in your soul,
[1:03:49] you're missing.
[1:03:52] I'm going to speak directly to everybody
[1:03:54] here.
[1:03:55] There's no pulling any punches. I don't
[1:03:57] care how old you are. It's not an old
[1:03:58] people's message.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I received this message at 12 years old.
[1:04:02] It was a genuine revelation in my heart.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me it's not the truth.
[1:04:08] I've watched it manifest itself over and
[1:04:10] over again
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; perfectly with the word.
[1:04:15] So, there's no such a thing as I'm too
[1:04:17] young, I'm too old. That's
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:04:22] It's revelation, brother, sister. And it
[1:04:24] takes something of God in you to receive
[1:04:26] it.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; It takes the seed of God in you to
[1:04:30] receive it. It takes a listening post
[1:04:32] for him to make it known to you.
[1:04:34] Otherwise, you have an intellectual
[1:04:35] conception. We don't want that. We got
[1:04:37] to have him. And if that strikes your
[1:04:40] heart, I don't care how who you're
[1:04:42] related to and who you're not related
[1:04:43] to. If that strikes your heart, you
[1:04:45] better act on it quickly.
[1:04:49] Amen. Amen. Because someday I'm going to
[1:04:52] stand before us all right here.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to begin to answer what I
[1:04:55] said here this morning
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and what I've said through the years.
[1:05:00] I'm not young anymore. As I said,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I've had a lot of experiences. I've seen
[1:05:05] many, many, many miracles. I've seen God
[1:05:08] anoint his word, cast out devils, move
[1:05:10] storms, heal dogs, raise the dead, heal
[1:05:14] animals. Brother, sister, over and over
[1:05:17] again. That's God doing that. But that's
[1:05:20] not meaning I because I But thank God
[1:05:22] the revelation's never left. He keeps
[1:05:24] revealing. He keeps opening his word as
[1:05:26] he said he would.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You don't tell me it's not real. It's
[1:05:31] more real than I'm than you're seeing
[1:05:33] me.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It's not an AI.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; It's not something dying. It's eternal.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. And watch what
[1:05:47] he says here. He says, "You're from
[1:05:50] another world. Your spirit's from across
[1:05:51] the chasm.
[1:05:54] You are from another world." Other
[1:05:57] words, what I'm living is out of this
[1:06:00] world.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It is a royal seed, a royal race.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And I am royalty.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're with me.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't even question that. I am
[1:06:14] royalty above royalty today.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; The bride is royalty above royalty. It
[1:06:20] don't matter how much of a popper you
[1:06:22] are and how much you don't have or do
[1:06:23] have.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God chose you in himself before
[1:06:28] the foundation of the world. And that
[1:06:31] settles it. And God has given me that
[1:06:34] Holy Spirit, that word living inside of
[1:06:36] me which is identified that that's so
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; to me personally.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he can to you personally. So
[1:06:44] here you go. You're from another world.
[1:06:46] Your spirit's from across the chasm. And
[1:06:49] this thing here is such a messed up
[1:06:51] thing. If you don't think it's messed
[1:06:52] up, then you tell me. Talk about
[1:06:55] insanity.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, the world today is beyond what
[1:07:01] we call insanity. We can't even say it
[1:07:04] right.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] Yet there's a hiding place.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; There's a peace that passes all of that
[1:07:14] understanding.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? A star in
[1:07:18] basketball or would you rather go home
[1:07:20] and live for eternity?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Take your choice. You're dying every
[1:07:26] day. You're dying right now.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Your flesh man is dying.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; You go through this day. It's taken one
[1:07:34] step closer
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; to the grave.
[1:07:38] Amen. I don't care how old you are.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's only one life, eternal
[1:07:44] life. And that ought to have preeminence
[1:07:46] in everything you do. That ought to be
[1:07:48] where you're standing. You want more of
[1:07:50] God. You say, "I'm struggling. I'm doing
[1:07:52] this and that." And you're trying to
[1:07:53] find the help through education and
[1:07:55] science. You're going down the wrong
[1:07:57] path.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that has life and
[1:08:03] has eternal life and has healing.
[1:08:05] There's no other healer but God himself.
[1:08:08] And there's no other way you can be
[1:08:09] healed but outside of faith.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; If thou canst believe,
[1:08:16] all things are possible.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:08:25] [snorts]
[1:08:26] It's a messed up thing up here. If
[1:08:28] you're not different, there's something
[1:08:30] wrong with you. If you're not different
[1:08:32] than the culture, there's something
[1:08:34] wrong.
[1:08:36] You're still too earthbound.
[1:08:39] You ought to be heavenly minded.
[1:08:42] Heaven lives by the word.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Boy, you start living by the word and
[1:08:48] you're going to rub the culture the
[1:08:50] wrong way.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; There's going to be friction. Yeah.
[1:08:55] Yeah.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You start walking like a real Christian
[1:08:58] ought to walk in the light of the word
[1:09:00] and you're not going to be well accepted
[1:09:02] or received. The only one you're going
[1:09:04] to be well accepted received by is
[1:09:05] another bride.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm I'm not saying there's
[1:09:10] good people born, you know, sanctified
[1:09:12] people and they're good people and
[1:09:14] because they're good to the bride
[1:09:15] because they're a help to them because
[1:09:17] they go to church every day in messy
[1:09:19] churches. I'm not saying they're bad
[1:09:20] people. They are bad. They're not bad
[1:09:22] people. But I'm trying to make a point.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; They won't understand. But the only one
[1:09:27] that going to understand and receive is
[1:09:30] that little bride because she's born
[1:09:32] again.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus walked among them. They couldn't
[1:09:36] understand him. He looked he looked like
[1:09:38] a mystic to them. Nobody could
[1:09:39] understand him like he talked in riddles
[1:09:41] all the time.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; If that was him yesterday, what is he
[1:09:46] today?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying. We're not trying to be
[1:09:50] that way. But that's his character.
[1:09:52] That's his life.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:55] But in this day,
[1:10:00] how many see the promise being
[1:10:01] fulfilled? Brother said, "Now we see
[1:10:04] that this day these promises is
[1:10:06] fulfilled." Let me tell you something.
[1:10:08] Let me pass this along to you. And I He
[1:10:11] said, "When the supernatural comes in,
[1:10:13] that's the Holy Ghost himself. When the
[1:10:15] supernatural comes in, that's the mind
[1:10:17] of Christ."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] Yeah, we look for the super. I look for
[1:10:23] the super. I believe in supernatural
[1:10:25] movings, but unless that supernatural
[1:10:27] lives inside of me
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; on the inside of the inside
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; in the soul realm,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; you're not going in a rapture.
[1:10:40] You say, "That's blunt." I'm going to
[1:10:42] say it again. I want it to be blunt.
[1:10:44] You're not going in a rapture without
[1:10:46] that Holy Ghost, the word himself,
[1:10:48] living in your soul. That's right.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; All that the Father has given me will
[1:10:57] come. And no man can come except my
[1:10:59] father draws him.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Now, you've been called, but many are
[1:11:04] called,
[1:11:06] but few are chosen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; But are you the chosen?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It depends what you want to do with it.
[1:11:12] This thing is thrown in your lap this
[1:11:14] morning.
[1:11:17] depends what you want to do with it.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You have the choice.
[1:11:23] It depends on what's in the soul.
[1:11:27] It depends what's longing inside of
[1:11:29] there.
[1:11:33] If you you can give lip service and say,
[1:11:35] "I need more of God." Or you can give
[1:11:37] true lip service to say, "I need him
[1:11:39] more than ever. I need more of him.
[1:11:45] then it's meaning something because now
[1:11:48] you're speaking from your heart,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; not from this other realm. Trying to be
[1:11:54] good, trying to impress somebody, trying
[1:11:56] to be religious. Get rid of it. It's
[1:11:58] nonsense. It's a lie of the devil.
[1:12:00] There's all kinds of that perversion
[1:12:02] around here.
[1:12:05] Let's be real.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Let's be genuine.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Okay, I think I'm going to close here.
[1:12:14] is growing in a bride. Brother, sister,
[1:12:15] the true revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:12:17] growing in the bride to the full
[1:12:19] stature. What I'm telling you today, I'm
[1:12:22] relating to you the full stature
[1:12:26] charity.
[1:12:28] That's what he come for. And he has a
[1:12:30] bride
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; maturing.
[1:12:34] I believe she's right very close now
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; to stepping over.
[1:12:39] I don't mean just in natural. My age,
[1:12:41] you know, he could look at me and say,
[1:12:42] "Yeah, you're about ready to step over
[1:12:43] another 10 years, maybe 15.
[1:12:46] My dad was old.
[1:12:49] He was 94. I don't know if I don't I
[1:12:52] don't really want to stay around that
[1:12:53] long,
[1:12:55] but I want to be here as long as God
[1:12:57] wants me here. And I am to minister this
[1:13:00] truth as long as God opens that door."
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Because it's more than life to me. It's
[1:13:05] more than look, it's more than what I
[1:13:06] feel. Because more than anything else,
[1:13:12] it is eternal life.
[1:13:21] Sometimes I wish I could say it the way
[1:13:23] I see it so clear. [snorts]
[1:13:32] When she comes in, that's the mind of
[1:13:35] Christ. You become so far away from your
[1:13:37] own thinking till your own mind. Don't
[1:13:39] let me try to explain that because I
[1:13:41] can't. I couldn't do it. There's nobody
[1:13:43] could do it. Don't try to explain that
[1:13:45] of the supernatural because you can't do
[1:13:47] it. And the only thing to do is just go
[1:13:48] right ahead.
[1:13:50] Keep walking with him.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Just keep walking with him. Let him be
[1:13:55] your ambition. Let him be your desire.
[1:13:57] Let him be first place. Seek ye first
[1:13:59] the kingdom of God and his
[1:14:01] righteousness, and these other things
[1:14:03] will be added unto you. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Seek that first and God will take care
[1:14:08] of the rest of it. Where you need to be,
[1:14:10] what you need to do in life, you put him
[1:14:12] first.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; And I pray God help these parents
[1:14:19] to put this before their children
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; and bring them up in the way they should
[1:14:24] be brought up and not be afraid to tell
[1:14:26] them the truth.
[1:14:31] Let's
[1:14:33] [snorts]
[1:14:34] start being what we're spent to be. A
[1:14:36] mother of the home, a real mother, a
[1:14:39] real father, a real leader.
[1:14:42] And quit listening to the culture.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:48] Don't go to back to some psychology of
[1:14:50] the greatest psychology book you ever
[1:14:51] had, and that's the Bible.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] But just remember, there's a battle
[1:14:57] going on and devil's going to try to
[1:14:59] talk you out of it on the battleground
[1:15:01] of your mind. What was said right here
[1:15:03] this morning.
[1:15:09] You say, "How do you know that, Brother
[1:15:10] David?" Because I've experienced. I know
[1:15:12] what he does.
[1:15:18] We're not ignorant of his devices.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; You've learned. You've learned what his
[1:15:23] tricks are.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Let's be vigilant.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You're born of the spirit. Let's be
[1:15:29] vigilant.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Let that devil come walking in there.
[1:15:33] Teach your children the right way. Bring
[1:15:35] them up under the word. Tell them the
[1:15:36] truth.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:15:51] [snorts]
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; The bride is himself
[1:15:56] revealed.
[1:15:59] She's the manifest.
[1:16:01] She's the manifestation of the word in
[1:16:03] the bride in the formation of the bride.
[1:16:06] She's him. Let's stand together. I'm
[1:16:09] going to stop.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't feel to stop until right then.
[1:16:13] So, I'm just going to have to put that
[1:16:14] in the Lord's hand. No matter what you
[1:16:15] think about it, I'm sorry. You think he
[1:16:18] takes so long. He takes so long. Listen,
[1:16:20] you think I take so long, if you miss
[1:16:23] this rapture, you're going to wonder why
[1:16:25] you didn't take it longer.
[1:16:29] That's the truth. You miss going home,
[1:16:33] you're going to wonder about those times
[1:16:35] when you thought it took too long.
[1:16:42] We can't be we can't take enough time
[1:16:44] [music] with this. The devil's trying to
[1:16:46] keep us too busy. You need to step aside
[1:16:48] a little bit and meditate upon [music]
[1:16:50] the things of the word. Get alone.
[1:16:53] God, what am I to do? I'm facing
[1:16:56] eternity. [music] Not whether my husband
[1:16:57] comes in, whether this one doesn't or
[1:16:59] this one does. What am I going to do
[1:17:01] with Christ? [music]
[1:17:03] What am I going to do with this Jesus
[1:17:05] called to Christ that's present here
[1:17:06] this morning that's right here among us?
[1:17:09] What are you going to do with him? Going
[1:17:11] to go your old way
[1:17:15] [music] or you going to give yourself to
[1:17:16] him? Now's your opportunity.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Don't pass it by. God works in simple
[1:17:22] ways. It's just your opportunity,
[1:17:24] brother, sister.
[1:17:26] Don't let it pass you. I had a lot more
[1:17:29] to say.
[1:17:32] [snorts]
[1:17:34] Maybe the Lord allow me to take it
[1:17:35] [music] again.
[1:17:39] But I love him. Do you love him?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I just feel there's such a presence
[1:17:47] here.
[1:17:51] God, help us each one. I just want you
[1:17:53] to get real with God here [music] this
[1:17:55] morning.
[1:17:57] Don't look at the preacher. Don't look
[1:17:58] at how much time it's taken. I want you
[1:18:01] to get real with him.
[1:18:03] [music] You're going to answer him.
[1:18:04] You're not going to answer me someday.
[1:18:06] I'll give an answer for what I speak to
[1:18:08] you. But I'm going to still be there
[1:18:11] with that little bride. By the grace of
[1:18:13] God.
[1:18:15] That's all it is. By the grace of God. A
[1:18:18] divine enablement. When something you
[1:18:20] can't produce, God gives it to you. Are
[1:18:22] [snorts] you willing to receive it,
[1:18:24] though? Are you willing to receive it?
[1:18:26] That's the thing.
[1:18:29] God help us.
[1:18:31] My heart's just bleeding. [snorts]
[1:18:36] The bride saw the bride. The prophet saw
[1:18:39] the bride marching in the preview of the
[1:18:41] bride. There was that worldly church out
[1:18:44] there undressed, naked.
[1:18:46] Don't see how close you can live to the
[1:18:48] world, brother, sister. See how much how
[1:18:51] close you can live to the word.
[1:18:57] Stay away from that edge
[1:19:00] of unbelief as far as you can.
[1:19:04] You let God come in. You let God have
[1:19:07] control. He's asking you to completely
[1:19:10] surrender your life to him. He's asking
[1:19:13] you to let him come in. Dear God,
[1:19:18] [snorts] I don't know what words to say.
[1:19:24] I know, Lord, that this has been
[1:19:26] ordained of you.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the number of people.
[1:19:33] It doesn't matter Lord who's listening,
[1:19:34] who isn't listening.
[1:19:37] I just you speaking. Lord, you know all
[1:19:39] about [laughter] that. [snorts] I'm
[1:19:41] saying, Lord,
[1:19:44] don't let them miss the birth. I pray
[1:19:46] there's still able, still people that
[1:19:48] can come in, [snorts] still young people
[1:19:51] that can receive it.
[1:19:54] Lord, I don't know. It [snorts] may be
[1:19:57] over. What if it is this morning? What
[1:19:59] if this is your last moment? What if
[1:20:00] this is your last time that you'll be
[1:20:03] able to receive it?
[1:20:07] I can't tell you there's going to be
[1:20:09] that last time.
[1:20:12] It may be shut.
[1:20:15] The last one may be married.
[1:20:18] I don't know. [snorts]
[1:20:22] But oh God,
[1:20:24] have mercy.
[1:20:26] move upon every individual life this
[1:20:28] morning.
[1:20:30] [snorts]
[1:20:32] Let that heart of theirs be an altar
[1:20:36] where they'll let go. Give themselves
[1:20:39] entirely to you, Lord.
[1:20:42] Don't let them hesitate anymore.
[1:20:47] [snorts]
[1:20:50] Let them make that choice that you're my
[1:20:53] head, Lord. I'll follow you.
[1:20:58] I'll go where you want me to go. I'll be
[1:21:00] what your word said for me to be.
[1:21:02] [snorts] I take you as my head.
[1:21:05] I take you as my salvation, my strength,
[1:21:09] [music] my rock.
[1:21:12] God have mercy. I'll pray. I pray. Have
[1:21:15] mercy.
[1:21:18] [snorts]
[1:21:19] Thy will be done. Lord,
[1:21:22] as I release this people into your
[1:21:24] hands,
[1:21:27] they have the opportunity to make it
[1:21:29] right.
[1:21:32] Just [snorts] right there where they're
[1:21:33] seated. They can turn their life
[1:21:36] completely over.
[1:21:38] Not by emotion, not looking for emotion,
[1:21:41] but looking for a genuine truth,
[1:21:43] revelation of truth that strike their
[1:21:45] hearts and they respond to it. That's
[1:21:48] what you're looking for.
[1:21:54] Oh God, I commit them to you. [music]
[1:21:56] This service is in your hands. These
[1:21:59] people are in your hands.
[1:22:02] [snorts]
[1:22:04] Lord, I don't know what else to say.
[1:22:07] I've taken all that I know to do right
[1:22:09] now.
[1:22:11] Thou art my judge of that. [snorts]
[1:22:15] And Lord, I know that you don't mince
[1:22:19] words.
[1:22:20] Your words are perfect. Let them
[1:22:22] realize, Lord, there's nothing as
[1:22:25] perfect as yourself that they could ever
[1:22:27] go to. Everything else is imperfect.
[1:22:29] Everything else is temporary.
[1:22:35] Let them make their choice to serve you,
[1:22:37] Father. [music] Not mix it. Don't let
[1:22:39] them go out and mix the world with this
[1:22:41] anymore.
[1:22:42] See, I believe let go out and mix it.
[1:22:45] Put this with that and mix it. [music]
[1:22:47] Mix a word with something else. Mix the
[1:22:49] word with a re reasoning. Mix the word.
[1:22:52] Lord, we're not mixers. [snorts]
[1:22:54] That word is absolute. You can't be
[1:22:57] mixed.
[1:23:01] Oh, God, help us. [snorts]
[1:23:04] It's not about mixing. [music]
[1:23:06] Well, I'll be this plus that. No, you
[1:23:08] heard me preach this last time.
[1:23:11] No double-mindedness in the bride of
[1:23:13] Christ. He [snorts] that is
[1:23:14] double-minded is unstable in all of his
[1:23:17] ways.
[1:23:20] You can't mix it, brother, sister. You
[1:23:22] either absolutely 100% given over to him
[1:23:25] or you're mixing. [snorts]
[1:23:27] We don't live between two
[1:23:31] two minds here, caught in between.
[1:23:33] That's a bad place.
[1:23:36] You can't mix it. You're either 100%
[1:23:39] [music] living for Christ or you're not.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:53] [snorts] We're not living by two
[1:23:57] different
[1:23:58] [snorts]
[1:23:59] minds. As [music] I said, Lord,
[1:24:16] oh God, help us, Father.
[1:24:19] Just waiting a [music] few minutes.
[1:24:23] Let God move. [snorts]
[1:24:28] In a few minutes, I'm going to ask
[1:24:29] brother to [music] come up here and
[1:24:31] close with a couple songs or whatever's
[1:24:33] on his heart. But [music] I'm just going
[1:24:35] to wait just a few minutes [snorts]
[1:24:37] while you're in the presence of the
[1:24:39] Lord. Let him speak.
[1:24:41] It's [music] good that we wait on the
[1:24:43] Lord.
[1:24:45] Brother Brandham said, "You've done the
[1:24:46] speaking. Now be quiet and let him speak
[1:24:48] [music] to you."
[1:24:50] He has spoken to you.
[1:24:55] [snorts]
[1:24:55] So you're facing choice.
[1:24:59] Lights been put [music] in your path.
[1:25:04] [snorts]
[1:25:10] As I said, we're not living a divided
[1:25:11] interest.
[1:25:15] I'll take this and I'll take this and
[1:25:16] I'll mix the two together. No, he wants
[1:25:18] a complete separation
[1:25:21] from all unbelief. [music]
[1:25:24] complete separated. If he's called you
[1:25:26] to be a certain thing and done a certain
[1:25:28] thing and then you try to mix it, it
[1:25:30] won't work. [music] You need to
[1:25:31] completely give over and let God have
[1:25:34] his way with you.
[1:25:37] [snorts]
[1:25:48] [snorts]
[1:25:50] Go ahead, brother. Come.
[1:25:55] God bless [music] you.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Speak your word
[1:26:23] into our hearts and have your way.
[1:26:34] Have your way.
[1:26:39] from your heart.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Have [singing and music] your way.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Holy [singing]
[1:26:49] [music] Spirit,
[1:26:51] fill
[1:26:53] our [singing] hearts and [music] have
[1:26:56] your way
[1:27:02] as [music and singing] we wait.
[1:27:08] And [singing] as we pray,
[1:27:12] [music]
[1:27:15] speak your word
[1:27:19] into [singing and music] our hearts and
[1:27:22] have your way.
[1:27:28] Oh, have your way.
[1:27:36] Have [music and singing] your way.
[1:27:44] Holy [music] Spirit,
[1:27:46] [singing] fill our hearts and have your
[1:27:52] way.
[1:27:57] And as we [music and singing] wait
[1:28:03] and [music and singing] as we pray,
[1:28:10] speak your words
[1:28:14] into [music and singing]
[1:28:15] our hearts and have your way. [music]
[1:28:23] And we are the generation key of F.
[1:28:30] We are the generation.
[1:28:36] We're the [singing]
[1:28:38] culmination. [music]
[1:28:40] The final voice. The world will hear.
[1:28:45] The coming [singing and music]
[1:28:46] of the Lord is near.
[1:28:50] Living out [singing] the revelation.
[1:28:56] overcoming [music and singing]
[1:28:57] sins, temptation.
[1:28:59] The truth will go to every tongue and
[1:29:05] nation.
[1:29:10] We are the [music] chosen generation.
[1:29:17] One more time.
[1:29:20] We are the [singing] generation.
[1:29:25] We're the culmination.
[1:29:28] [music and singing]
[1:29:29] The final voice. The world will hear.
[1:29:34] The coming [music and singing]
[1:29:35] of the Lord is near.
[1:29:40] Living out [music and singing]
[1:29:41] the revelation.
[1:29:45] Overcoming [singing and music]
[1:29:46] sins temptation. The truth will go to
[1:29:52] every [singing] tongue [music] and
[1:29:54] nation.
[1:29:59] We are the chosen [singing]
[1:30:02] generation.
[1:30:07] Thank you Lord
[1:30:11] for [music and singing] saving
[1:30:14] my soul.
[1:30:18] Thank [music] you [singing]
[1:30:20] Lord
[1:30:22] for making
[1:30:25] me [music and singing] whole.
[1:30:29] Thank
[1:30:31] you [music and singing] Lord
[1:30:34] for giving
[1:30:36] to me
[1:30:40] thy great [music and singing]
[1:30:42] salvation
[1:30:45] so rich
[1:30:47] and free.
[1:30:51] Thank
[1:30:52] you Lord
[1:30:55] for saving
[1:30:58] my soul. [music]
[1:31:02] Thank
[1:31:03] you Lord
[1:31:06] for making [music] me whole.
[1:31:12] Thank
[1:31:14] you [music] Lord
[1:31:17] for giving
[1:31:19] to [music and singing] me
