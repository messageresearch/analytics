[40:59] Lord that's our desire this morning
[41:04] do not get in the way Lord
[41:07] to not preach as a man
[41:09] preach as a vessel that you will use
[41:11] this morning
[41:13] open our hearts to the truth
[41:16] of the spirit world that would like to
[41:19] control Our Lives
[41:21] I pray this morning you would break it
[41:25] followed the prince of the power of the
[41:27] air would have no hope
[41:29] on your people Jesus your word said
[41:31] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[41:33] Liberty
[41:34] well then you have anointed us to preach
[41:36] the gospel
[41:37] or in spirit and in truth
[41:40] that is the truth that sets your people
[41:42] free
[41:43] God I pray this morning you would bring
[41:45] freedom in our lives Lord Jesus
[41:47] that or only you
[41:49] and you alone would have a say in US
[41:51] Lord Jesus we would not be pushed around
[41:54] by every wind of Doctrine but God May
[41:55] would stand firmly our feet planted on
[41:58] the Rock which is the revelation
[41:59] who you are in hospital
[42:02] thank you Father God bless your people
[42:05] this morning bless this assembly Lord
[42:08] we're giving all things into your hands
[42:10] now in Jesus name we pray
[42:13] amen
[42:15] thank you musicians
[42:17] Isaac thank you amen thank you for your
[42:20] prayers for us Vietnam had a good time
[42:23] God really blessed us last weekend
[42:26] amen if you have your Bibles turn to
[42:28] Hebrews chapter 6.
[42:31] this morning
[42:39] it is never my job as a minister to
[42:41] convince you of anything
[42:43] and does my job as a minister to preach
[42:45] to you to the to you the word
[42:47] let God bring the revelation
[42:52] and let God do the work in your life
[42:54] amen Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1.
[42:57] therefore leaving the principles of the
[43:00] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[43:02] Perfection not laying again the
[43:04] foundation of repentance from dead works
[43:06] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[43:09] of baptisms and laying on of hands and
[43:12] of resurrection of the dead and of
[43:14] Eternal judgment
[43:15] and this will we do if God permit for it
[43:18] is impossible for those who were once
[43:20] enlightened and have tasted the Heavenly
[43:22] gift and were made partakers of the Holy
[43:24] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[43:27] God and the powers of the world to come
[43:29] if they shall fall away to renew them
[43:31] again unto repentance
[43:33] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[43:35] Son of God afresh and put him to an open
[43:38] shame for the Earth which drinketh in
[43:41] the rain that cometh offed upon it and
[43:43] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[43:46] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[43:48] from God
[43:50] but that which beareth thorns and Briars
[43:52] is rejected and is nigh into cursing
[43:54] whose in is to be burned
[43:56] first John chapter 5.
[44:03] first John 5 verse 1.
[44:14] whosoever believeth that Jesus says the
[44:16] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[44:18] loveth him that begot
[44:21] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[44:24] by this we know that we love the
[44:26] children of God when we love God and
[44:29] keep his Commandments
[44:32] it is not to say I love God but that
[44:35] love is a Divine love
[44:38] is a love only put there because Christ
[44:40] is inside amen for this is the love of
[44:43] God that we keep his Commandments and
[44:45] his Commandments are not Grievous for
[44:47] whatsoever is born of God that keep his
[44:49] Commandments and his Commandments are
[44:51] not excuse me for whatever is born of
[44:53] God overcometh the world
[44:55] is that what that's what I want I want
[44:57] to know how to overcome the world that's
[45:00] where I'm living
[45:01] and this is the victory that overcometh
[45:03] the world even our faith
[45:07] Faith hold on to that
[45:09] hold on to that word faith who is he
[45:11] that overcometh the world but he that
[45:13] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[45:15] so all I have to do is believe
[45:18] not necessarily in a sense
[45:21] but to believe unto unto what
[45:25] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[45:26] you believed the Bible says
[45:31] who is he that overcometh the world but
[45:34] he that believeth that Jesus is the son
[45:36] of God this is he that came by water and
[45:38] blood even Jesus Christ not by water
[45:40] only
[45:42] but by water and blood and it is the
[45:45] spirit that beareth witness because the
[45:47] spirit is truth
[45:49] for there are three now watch carefully
[45:51] there are three that bear record in
[45:53] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[45:55] Ghost and these three are one I hear
[45:59] verse 8 and there are three that bear
[46:00] witness in Earth the spirit the water
[46:03] the blood and these three agree in one
[46:06] if we receive the witness of men the
[46:09] witness of God is greater for this is
[46:11] the witness of God which he hath
[46:12] testified of his son he they believeth
[46:15] on the Son of God hath to witness in
[46:17] himself he that believeth not God hath
[46:20] made him a liar because he believeth not
[46:23] the record that God gave of his son and
[46:27] this is the record that God hath given
[46:28] to us
[46:29] eternal life and this life is in his son
[46:34] Christ is our life Christ is our eternal
[46:39] life he that hath son hath life amen
[46:44] and he that hath not the Son of God hath
[46:48] not life that's it may the Lord bless
[46:50] the reading of his word he can be seated
[46:52] this morning
[46:55] foreign
[46:59] I was I was struggling with this thought
[47:03] this morning just very much in prayer
[47:07] last night and
[47:10] you know you got to pray through you got
[47:11] to wrestle with God and
[47:13] and uh it is never my my job as a
[47:17] minister to preach my opinion
[47:19] and there's certain topics whereas
[47:22] ministers and I know our pastor and
[47:23] Brother David will agree or if we're not
[47:25] careful our opinion our opinion does
[47:27] come out
[47:28] we can get you know because we're men
[47:31] but I I but when you touch those topics
[47:34] you pray God I want your word this
[47:37] morning I am going to just read the word
[47:40] I am going to to preach the word
[47:43] now it's going to be your job and God's
[47:46] job to give you Revelation and they're
[47:48] you to take that word it's not my idea
[47:51] it's not my opinion but it's God's word
[47:53] so my title this morning
[47:55] you want to bring that up is the spirit
[47:57] within the birth
[48:02] Spirit within the birth now I have quite
[48:04] a few quotes and and uh this morning I
[48:07] don't I don't want to take too much time
[48:09] if uh the Lord permits we finish these
[48:13] quotes then that's his will if we don't
[48:15] get through it and you are full then
[48:17] that is his will
[48:19] Israel and the church so I want to talk
[48:21] about justification
[48:23] lay a foundation here to talk about
[48:26] being born again and what about the new
[48:28] birth
[48:29] so justification we know is water
[48:33] the the baptized being baptized in the
[48:35] name of Jesus Christ that's the first
[48:37] step that is the water
[48:38] and brother says in Israel in the church
[48:41] he says now I want to quieten you you
[48:43] down just a minute and Judas was with
[48:46] them is that right Judas was just as big
[48:50] a duck was in the puddle he was I don't
[48:52] know what that means he was shouting and
[48:54] rejoicing too and that part I understand
[48:56] and he followed the church right on down
[48:59] till it come to Pentecost and when it
[49:01] come to Pentecost to receive the baptism
[49:03] of the Holy Ghost he refused it and
[49:05] betrayed Jesus
[49:07] and that was the Antichrist and that
[49:10] Spirit today will come right down and
[49:12] teach justification by faith and
[49:14] everything and everything
[49:16] so what's between justification and the
[49:18] Holy Spirit is sanctification
[49:20] and move right on down up to the
[49:22] baptismal holy spirit so Justified
[49:24] Sanctified there's a script story in the
[49:26] Bible where brother where Jesus talks he
[49:28] says them the man cleaned the house
[49:31] but the good man of the home wasn't in
[49:33] the house and the devil came back and it
[49:36] was worse
[49:37] it's not enough to be sanctified
[49:40] uh and and move right on down to the
[49:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost then show its
[49:44] colors that's exactly so Judas was
[49:46] justified and Sanctified questions and
[49:49] answers 1964. brother Branham if
[49:52] possible this is a question if possible
[49:54] for a person to be lost
[49:57] and end up in hell if he rejects the
[50:00] light of the word even though he has a
[50:02] genuine experience of justification and
[50:04] sanctification he says yes sir that is
[50:07] exactly right the only ones at the end
[50:09] time
[50:10] which we'll reference a lot in this
[50:12] sermon one of his disciples the
[50:14] treasurer of the church Jesus called him
[50:16] his friend see the Bible said he was
[50:18] born the son of perdition
[50:21] just the same as Jesus was born the son
[50:23] of God
[50:25] he said deceive the very elect if it
[50:27] were possible
[50:31] the Lord knows my heart and thy burden
[50:33] this morning
[50:38] if we're not careful we get confused and
[50:41] God has given a scripture after
[50:43] scripture let us not be put to confusion
[50:45] to be confused in the scripture is to be
[50:48] partakers of idolatry idolatry is
[50:52] confusion to accept the false Doctrine
[50:55] is to accept confusion but God always
[50:57] brings Clarity in our lives and there's
[51:00] a point in our lives where God says now
[51:02] it's time for clarity
[51:04] in for you overcoming is first
[51:08] identifying
[51:10] identifying the devil at his tricks
[51:14] I pray this morning God would bring
[51:16] Clarity the next step in in in this
[51:19] process is what we call sanctification
[51:21] which is the blood Ephesians 5 verse 25
[51:24] if you want to turn there with me
[51:27] Ephesians 5 25.
[51:31] this is no new gospel this morning this
[51:33] is the word of God Ephesians chapter 5
[51:39] verse 25.
[51:48] husbands you know we always want to read
[51:50] the first verses but I want to just
[51:53] take a small bunny trail here husbands
[51:55] love your wives even as Christ also love
[51:57] the church and gave himself for it oh
[52:00] well she won't line up
[52:02] she won't submit how are you treating
[52:04] her
[52:05] are you loving her look what God God
[52:07] while we were sinners
[52:10] while our lives were in effect chewing
[52:12] him out
[52:13] he died for us
[52:15] we as husbands must love our wives
[52:20] as Christ loved the church you want to
[52:22] know what's how to be a good husband
[52:23] look at the example and the relationship
[52:25] Christ has with his bride that's right
[52:27] we are called to adore her to to to lift
[52:31] her up to be her she's our girlfriend to
[52:35] have that relationship with her where we
[52:36] say what what do you want I want to give
[52:38] it to you because that's what God says
[52:40] ask and you shall receive
[52:43] 20 verse 26 that he might sanctify and
[52:46] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[52:48] by the word so Christ had to love the
[52:51] church and give himself for it to
[52:54] sanctify it
[52:55] we are part of the church this morning
[52:58] to sanctify it washing of the Water by
[53:01] the word the word of God which is also
[53:04] the blood of God that he might present
[53:07] it to himself a glorious church not
[53:09] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[53:11] but that it should be holy and without
[53:13] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[53:16] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[53:19] wife loveth himself
[53:22] Hebrews 13 verse 2 wherefore Jesus also
[53:25] that he might sanctify the people with
[53:27] his own blood suffered without the gift
[53:33] so we are Sanctified by the blood of
[53:35] Jesus Christ which came according to his
[53:38] word
[53:39] the Bible is a book of Prophecy
[53:42] from the beginning of the world to the
[53:44] end of the world everything that's going
[53:45] to happen is written in the book
[53:49] the word of God said I must come down
[53:52] and give my life
[53:53] and my blood will sanctify him
[53:57] in 1965 in birth pains
[54:00] it says now in first John 5 7 which
[54:02] which we read
[54:04] in the opening it says I believe it is
[54:06] if I'm not mistaken it said there are
[54:07] three that bear record in heaven the
[54:09] father of the word and the Holy Ghost
[54:10] these three are one these are three that
[54:12] bear record in Earth that's water blood
[54:15] and spirit they agree in one now notice
[54:18] the first three are one
[54:20] the second three are Earthly which agree
[54:23] in one
[54:25] cannot have the father without the son
[54:26] you cannot have the sun without having
[54:28] the Holy Ghost but you can have the
[54:30] water without the blood
[54:33] and the blood without the spirit
[54:36] I think through our ages I think through
[54:39] our ages has proved this to be true
[54:41] water blood spirit justification
[54:43] sanctification baptism of the holy
[54:44] spirit that types and and an anti-type
[54:48] which takes away from the natural birth
[54:49] natural always types of spiritual amen
[54:52] look when a woman or anything in travail
[54:54] for birth the first thing comes to pass
[54:56] the breaking of the water a normal birth
[54:58] second thing is the blood and then comes
[55:01] life
[55:02] water blood spirit that constitutes the
[55:05] normal natural birth
[55:08] and so it is it in the spiritual realm
[55:10] it's water justification by faith
[55:12] believing on God receiving him as your
[55:15] personal Savior and being baptized
[55:17] second is sanctification of the spirit
[55:19] that God cleanses the spirit from all
[55:21] elements of the world and the desire of
[55:24] the world and then the Holy Spirit comes
[55:26] in and gives the new birth and fills up
[55:28] the set Sanctified vessel
[55:31] all three you can have the water and not
[55:34] have it you could have the blood and not
[55:36] have it
[55:38] you could have the baptism of the Holy
[55:39] Spirit and not have it
[55:42] sir I'll jump to that quote since y'all
[55:44] gave me a weird look
[55:47] don't worry guys we'll
[55:49] if you want to jump this very last quote
[55:53] uh sorry it's not the last quote
[56:04] leadership 1965. the choice of your
[56:06] conduct you could you can't mix it now
[56:08] you're either for God or against God and
[56:10] the outward expression shows exactly
[56:12] what's on the inside see the cocklebur
[56:15] many of you think I got the baptism of
[56:16] the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that
[56:18] don't mean one thing that you're going
[56:20] to heaven no sir you can have the
[56:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[56:25] your life and still be lost and go to
[56:27] hell amen
[56:32] now I gotta go back and find my spot
[56:36] so all three for instance like this he
[56:38] says now we're back in uh the quote
[56:39] birth pains 1965.
[56:42] I think it's the first birth pains quote
[56:47] oh you got it right there okay
[56:49] for instance like this now that I told
[56:51] you
[56:53] um
[56:54] what you don't believe lay aside didn't
[56:56] take the pie so spit out the seed isn't
[56:58] what he's saying
[57:01] okay he says now a glass is so a cup is
[57:04] laying out in the chicken yard you don't
[57:06] just pick that up and put on your table
[57:08] and fill it with water or milk no by
[57:11] picking up is justification
[57:13] cleansing it is sanctification but that
[57:17] cup
[57:18] that cup is not ready to be is not being
[57:20] used
[57:21] he says cause the Greek word sanctify is
[57:24] a compound word which means cleanse and
[57:27] set aside for service
[57:30] not in service for service
[57:34] then when you fill it it is put in
[57:36] service
[57:38] now in Revelations 21 verse 27 there's a
[57:41] scripture that says there shall in no
[57:43] wise enter into it anything that defile
[57:46] lets us begin the Kingdom of Heaven
[57:47] neither whatsoever worketh Abomination
[57:49] or maketh a lie but they which are
[57:52] written in the Lamb's Book of Life we
[57:55] know for the foundation of the world we
[57:57] were Sons and Daughters of God God put
[57:59] us there God ordained us predestinated
[58:02] us by foreknowledge in other words he
[58:04] knew you would accept
[58:06] him he knew you would accept
[58:10] Christ
[58:12] okay statue of the perfect man 1962. he
[58:15] says all right first you must be born
[58:16] again then when you're born again now
[58:19] watch
[58:20] he says then you're born again you have
[58:23] faith
[58:24] when Moses went to the burning bush and
[58:28] God began to speak to him brother says
[58:30] God anointed his faith
[58:34] you are born with a with a seed you're
[58:37] in the natural in the natural you have
[58:39] the seed of God in you
[58:41] you don't have faith
[58:43] it's there
[58:44] but you don't have it that's it
[58:46] until God comes and he anoints that
[58:49] Faith now what is faith faith is the
[58:53] foundation right it's the bottom layer
[58:55] of the Statue of a perfect man it's the
[58:57] first thing Faith brings Revelation amen
[59:01] and faith comes when we listen to the
[59:04] word of God so feeding the word
[59:07] is gives us faith
[59:09] but you've got to be in a place to
[59:11] receive the word
[59:14] you're not going to put the word in a
[59:15] dirty cup no
[59:18] we take communion we're very careful
[59:20] with the cup and we keep it covering we
[59:22] pray and we bless it and we
[59:24] right God does not just doesn't want to
[59:26] he doesn't want us taking communion with
[59:27] the dirty cup
[59:30] neither does he want communion with us
[59:32] with a dirty cup
[59:34] but you're already a seed you're already
[59:37] seen that's that's going to have to give
[59:39] Revelation but that's how it should
[59:40] always be we just preach the word
[59:43] you're going to have to catch God's God
[59:46] wants to fill you up
[59:47] but you have to be in that position for
[59:49] him to do so and when he anoints that
[59:51] Faith you begin to see God
[59:53] for who he is so he says you're born
[59:55] again and you have faith you believe the
[59:58] word until you're born again you'll
[1:00:01] argue against it if you're just
[1:00:03] religiously inclined and you got a
[1:00:05] little human knowledge that you should
[1:00:06] do right you'll never be able to agree
[1:00:09] upon the word of God
[1:00:11] you'll never do it
[1:00:13] you've got to be born again and born
[1:00:16] again it produces faith
[1:00:20] Born Again produces faith
[1:00:24] then after you get Faith right there
[1:00:27] f-a-i-t-h then you're in a position
[1:00:30] of growing that's right
[1:00:33] now you're in the position of growing
[1:00:39] The born-again Experience produces faith
[1:00:42] in your life now you're in the position
[1:00:45] of growing
[1:00:47] another Foundation lay now let's go to
[1:00:49] circumcision Romans 2 verse 29 but he is
[1:00:52] a Jew which is one inwardly and now this
[1:00:56] is just the one scripture I picked
[1:00:57] there's a lot of scriptures on
[1:00:58] circumcision
[1:01:01] Paul really had to break it down because
[1:01:02] the Jews and the Gentiles clashed over
[1:01:05] the circumcision of the flesh
[1:01:07] so he really had to to come
[1:01:09] I'm glad it anoint him to speak because
[1:01:12] he was a die-hard Jew
[1:01:14] but the the word of God anointed Paul to
[1:01:17] speak to set the balance for this
[1:01:21] so it couldn't be Paul's opinion had to
[1:01:23] be God's word
[1:01:25] and they still fought with it after that
[1:01:27] because it's God's word spoken but you
[1:01:29] have to receive that word and God has to
[1:01:32] give you revelation of that word it is
[1:01:34] only my job as a minister to preach the
[1:01:36] word
[1:01:37] I should not appear trying to convince
[1:01:39] you of something if I try to convince
[1:01:41] you of something that's pointless
[1:01:43] chances are you're probably going to get
[1:01:44] mad at me
[1:01:48] or you'll become a man worshiper and I
[1:01:49] don't want that
[1:01:52] Romans 2 29 but he is a Jew which is one
[1:01:55] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[1:01:57] heart
[1:01:59] in the spirit and not in the letter
[1:02:01] whose praise is not of men but of God
[1:02:03] amen amen the spirit so circumcision we
[1:02:06] all believe circumcision is of the heart
[1:02:09] so you see you see where we're pulling
[1:02:12] these points from the scripture in the
[1:02:13] message and we're setting them out if I
[1:02:15] had a board I would write it out we're
[1:02:18] setting them out we have justification
[1:02:20] sanctification but that's not you can't
[1:02:22] stop there you can have those two and
[1:02:25] still go to hell
[1:02:26] you need you need you need and then a
[1:02:28] born-again experience produces faith
[1:02:32] and over here we have circumcision is of
[1:02:34] the heart now let's look at what
[1:02:36] circumcision is all about I will restore
[1:02:39] 1954. now what is circumcision today he
[1:02:42] says is the holy spirit God circumcises
[1:02:45] our heart by the Holy Spirit where it
[1:02:48] was done by the flesh with hands and
[1:02:50] days gone by but it's done by the Holy
[1:02:52] Spirit now when we believe correctly on
[1:02:55] the Lord Jesus Christ God gives the Holy
[1:02:58] Ghost to us to confirm it
[1:03:02] so we read first John 5 he says he that
[1:03:04] believeth on the son of God
[1:03:06] basically he says has eternal life
[1:03:09] but it's that it's that that scripture
[1:03:11] is talking about this right here
[1:03:13] when we believe correctly on the Lord
[1:03:16] Jesus Christ let me ask you a question
[1:03:18] you can nod your head you can raise your
[1:03:19] hand can you believe without faith
[1:03:24] you cannot
[1:03:26] you cannot
[1:03:27] the devil loves to loves to take the
[1:03:30] simple things of the word
[1:03:31] throw it in one cup and then Zoom way
[1:03:34] out
[1:03:35] right and anoint people to talk about
[1:03:38] that cup and people go wow yeah and they
[1:03:41] NE and then we just go along and we
[1:03:43] never Zoom back in
[1:03:46] and see God what are all the pieces that
[1:03:48] you have here it's so easy to get caught
[1:03:51] up in in a moment
[1:03:53] so easy to get caught up in something
[1:03:55] and you miss well what about this
[1:03:58] because it's all simple pieces to the
[1:04:00] puzzle
[1:04:01] we are complicated not God that's right
[1:04:05] God is simple we are complicated
[1:04:10] so
[1:04:12] God when we believe correctly oh I like
[1:04:15] how he says correctly it's not just
[1:04:17] believing what do you believe
[1:04:19] oh I believe Buddha I believe Muhammad
[1:04:21] okay believe correctly
[1:04:28] all of the strength of God that I'm
[1:04:30] we're speaking this morning all of this
[1:04:32] comes down to the fact that it's not
[1:04:34] based on
[1:04:35] the experience that we have it's not
[1:04:38] based on how we felt in the moment it's
[1:04:40] based on is our life bearing fruits of
[1:04:44] the gospel and if you want to know
[1:04:48] look at your life yesterday
[1:04:50] and then go to the word and say
[1:04:53] is that a reflection of this no excuse
[1:04:57] the mistakes apologize to God
[1:05:00] but is your life growing
[1:05:03] in reflecting Christ do you have a
[1:05:06] burning desire as a woman to dress
[1:05:08] modestly
[1:05:10] but we we have complicated this this
[1:05:13] topic the new birth we as humans have
[1:05:17] complicated it
[1:05:19] because they say oh it's this and one
[1:05:20] person says no it's this over here
[1:05:22] but God brought the word to bring us
[1:05:24] from this side and this side into
[1:05:26] balance you know I was reflecting on
[1:05:28] balance I I administered on balance last
[1:05:30] weekend and I was reflecting on balance
[1:05:33] on the Fly I think I was on a flight
[1:05:34] home and I was thinking about Jesus he's
[1:05:35] not he's spread out on the cross you
[1:05:37] know why why across and there's a lot of
[1:05:39] things but why his hands spread out
[1:05:40] while he's grabbing from this side of
[1:05:42] the road and he's grabbing from this
[1:05:44] side of the road and he's pulling it to
[1:05:45] the heart
[1:05:46] his desire even in his death he was
[1:05:49] trying to bring balance in our lives god
[1:05:51] Set the World in order in balance
[1:05:54] and it's our jobs as ministers when
[1:05:56] God's anoints us to speak something to
[1:05:58] bring that balance that we speak only
[1:06:00] the God only God's word not our opinion
[1:06:04] not our opinion
[1:06:06] so this is the word this is just the
[1:06:08] word this morning and and so okay
[1:06:11] and God gives the Holy Ghost to us to
[1:06:13] confirm it that our faith not ready for
[1:06:16] this when you're born again that
[1:06:18] produces faith
[1:06:20] okay and he says here go the holy goes
[1:06:24] to us to confirm it that our faith
[1:06:26] has been reckoned before him
[1:06:30] and imputed to us for righteousness
[1:06:32] without the Holy Spirit you never
[1:06:33] recognize it yet amen amen Jehovah Jireh
[1:06:36] 1962 and if he has never circumcised you
[1:06:39] yet by the Holy Ghost he hasn't received
[1:06:43] your faith yet
[1:06:46] when you're born again that produces
[1:06:50] faith
[1:06:51] the Holy Spirit
[1:06:53] recognizes your faith and seals you
[1:06:56] seals your heart with circumcision God
[1:06:58] gives the Holy Ghost as a confirmation
[1:07:01] he has received your faith
[1:07:05] your faith that was given to you before
[1:07:07] the world ever formed but God has to
[1:07:11] recognize that is this vessel ready
[1:07:15] is this vessel ready
[1:07:18] now if you stop believing
[1:07:21] because until you receive the Holy
[1:07:23] Spirit you're not sealed
[1:07:28] but as a child of God you will be sealed
[1:07:31] he says if you now if you stop believing
[1:07:34] and scrambling around
[1:07:36] and just believe God God will circumcise
[1:07:39] that heart and that cuts off all
[1:07:42] unbelief
[1:07:44] circumcises the world and all unbelief
[1:07:46] away from you and then you stand the
[1:07:48] word alone Jesus said if you abide in me
[1:07:50] in my word in you then ask what you will
[1:07:52] and it'll be given to you brother
[1:07:54] Brandon would have people come to prayer
[1:07:56] and he said will you accept Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] as your savior if you do so God will
[1:08:00] heal you
[1:08:04] hmm
[1:08:05] now
[1:08:09] and there's another spot where you know
[1:08:11] he says here if you stop believing you
[1:08:13] can so he's talking about stop believing
[1:08:15] and scrumbling around just believe God
[1:08:16] but if you get to the the the that the
[1:08:18] baptized in Jesus name sanctified
[1:08:22] and then you just
[1:08:23] what happens
[1:08:25] tells a story about a man who was blind
[1:08:27] he was a shoe cobbler and he was blind
[1:08:29] for 10 years
[1:08:31] and um he wouldn't he got prayed for
[1:08:34] but then prayed for him and God opened
[1:08:36] his eyes and he went back to his church
[1:08:38] and began to testify what God did and
[1:08:40] the Pastor said well
[1:08:42] no that you know
[1:08:44] you can't believe all that crazy
[1:08:46] nonsense basically in so many words
[1:08:48] and within just a few months the man was
[1:08:51] back in
[1:08:53] his Services just as blind as he was in
[1:08:56] the first place anybody makes the
[1:08:58] comment he says you will have your
[1:09:00] healing as long as you continue to
[1:09:02] believe
[1:09:04] now if we can apply apply that to
[1:09:06] Healing
[1:09:07] we can apply that to that promise that
[1:09:10] if we will Keep On Believing
[1:09:12] God will answer that but if we stop
[1:09:15] believing we lose that position
[1:09:18] until you're sealed and once you're
[1:09:20] sealed God recognizes that Faith you
[1:09:21] know what that means that faith will
[1:09:23] always be there
[1:09:26] now it always was
[1:09:29] it'll always be that you don't have to
[1:09:30] worry oh I'm gonna be deceived no you
[1:09:32] don't you will not be deceived God will
[1:09:34] bring you to Greater truth as you grow
[1:09:36] because you're in the position to grow
[1:09:39] Abraham was the first one we read in the
[1:09:42] Bible who was circumcised
[1:09:45] Genesis 17 verse 11 says and ye shall
[1:09:48] circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin
[1:09:50] and it shall be a token of the Covenant
[1:09:52] betwixt me and you
[1:09:55] so it's a token
[1:09:57] now there's a there's a quote and I
[1:10:00] don't know if I have it or not
[1:10:01] or brother Branham talks about
[1:10:03] Abraham and the circumcision and he says
[1:10:06] it took the name change
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] what was Abram's name changed Abraham it
[1:10:13] was testifying he was sanctified
[1:10:17] you are not you have been cleansed you
[1:10:20] have been sanctified people see the
[1:10:21] difference
[1:10:22] you're known by something else now
[1:10:25] but it takes circumcision to confirm
[1:10:27] that experience to confirm that faith in
[1:10:30] your heart
[1:10:34] in a why I am against organized religion
[1:10:42] it's very interesting to me
[1:10:44] how when you when you take a topic like
[1:10:46] this
[1:10:47] the sermons you quote from yeah
[1:10:51] or what I call the the fundamentals you
[1:10:53] know
[1:10:54] why am I just organized religion
[1:10:56] uh birth pains yeah
[1:11:00] um
[1:11:01] statue of a perfect man
[1:11:03] anointed ones at the end time
[1:11:06] he says to be born of the spirit is to
[1:11:09] believe and behave yourself in the
[1:11:12] spirit is to understand and believe with
[1:11:15] your heart that Jesus is Christ and this
[1:11:17] is his word that no other words can be
[1:11:20] added to it or taken away from it
[1:11:24] now he says there if you kept reading he
[1:11:25] says without your name taken out of the
[1:11:28] Book of Life later on he confirms that
[1:11:30] as a seed of God your name is put there
[1:11:33] you'll never be taken off because you'll
[1:11:35] never deny the word
[1:11:37] so a little further down he says if you
[1:11:39] add one thing to it in your tradition or
[1:11:41] take one thing from it Christ said
[1:11:43] himself your name shall ruled off the
[1:11:45] book now
[1:11:48] Born Again means a new birth from above
[1:11:53] birth from above then we are active in
[1:11:57] the things from above
[1:11:59] for it is himself acting in his word
[1:12:02] through you
[1:12:05] believing and acting upon the word for
[1:12:09] your hour those are my words sorry I
[1:12:11] ended the quote believing and acting
[1:12:13] upon the word for your hour we never say
[1:12:15] oh I was at the altar and I cried and
[1:12:18] now I have the Holy Ghost
[1:12:20] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:22] Spirit every day of your life and go to
[1:12:24] hell amen
[1:12:25] amen so we have to look at our lives we
[1:12:27] have to be mature Christians and we have
[1:12:28] to stop falling around about our
[1:12:30] feelings and we have to say what does
[1:12:32] the word say about me
[1:12:35] and if you can accept the word and keep
[1:12:37] accepting the word and then your life
[1:12:40] reflects that you are acting upon it
[1:12:43] there's your evidence
[1:12:45] brother Branham gave us the evidence God
[1:12:47] gave us the evidence through the
[1:12:48] ministry of the Prophet why are we still
[1:12:51] talking about it the wrong way
[1:12:54] why are we still
[1:12:56] pushing people not you necessarily not
[1:12:58] our pastor ministers here but why why as
[1:13:02] a whole the church
[1:13:04] The Message Church
[1:13:06] there is we and I had this disconnect I
[1:13:09] had this as a young person and for me
[1:13:11] that's a big burden because you go to
[1:13:12] camps they're not preaching against
[1:13:14] camps
[1:13:15] and there's a big workup and I had
[1:13:18] experience after experience in those
[1:13:21] workups and nothing changed
[1:13:24] but if you're not careful you go away
[1:13:26] thinking that what it's that's what it's
[1:13:29] all about and then people don't want to
[1:13:30] touch the quote where he says you can
[1:13:31] have the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:33] every day of your life and go to hell
[1:13:36] it's not for us to say I feel it today I
[1:13:39] don't feel it tomorrow
[1:13:41] it's for us to say is our life
[1:13:43] reflecting the word do I have that
[1:13:45] ability within me to accept the word
[1:13:49] do you have that desire for the word
[1:13:51] that hunger for the word that desire to
[1:13:54] be right
[1:13:55] to always be right to make things right
[1:13:57] well those are fruits of the spirit
[1:13:59] those are fruits of Christ
[1:14:03] so my prayer today
[1:14:05] to in the back to the Lord was that if
[1:14:08] there is an hindrance in your life where
[1:14:09] you you God is looking down saying you
[1:14:12] have the Holy Spirit
[1:14:15] but you're wrestling with it I pray this
[1:14:16] morning God will bring Clarity you would
[1:14:18] know your position amen that's right if
[1:14:21] you don't I pray God will bring the
[1:14:22] clarity so you know your position either
[1:14:25] way my desire every time I ministers God
[1:14:28] your word only
[1:14:29] and show the people their position amen
[1:14:36] if you okay
[1:14:41] now Titus 3 verse 5 says not by works of
[1:14:44] righteousness which we have done but
[1:14:47] according to his Mercy he saved us
[1:14:51] see it takes it takes Revelation saying
[1:14:54] to God
[1:14:56] it's that simple you tell people
[1:14:59] and you know when you're when you're in
[1:15:01] you're witnessing
[1:15:03] to people it's hard sometimes the
[1:15:05] certain things that we believe for them
[1:15:07] to accept
[1:15:09] and really it's for me when I say it
[1:15:11] it's just the devil coming in my mind
[1:15:13] but it sounds weak
[1:15:14] to say well you just have to have
[1:15:16] Revelation but the fact of the matter is
[1:15:18] it's that simple
[1:15:19] it's that simple when we witness to
[1:15:22] people this is now this is my for me
[1:15:24] speaking from my experience I over
[1:15:25] complicated because I tried to avoid the
[1:15:27] truth
[1:15:28] now you're not going to come to somebody
[1:15:30] and say do you know the serpent seed
[1:15:32] you and God to lead the conversation
[1:15:34] but just say the truth amen just speak
[1:15:36] because when you speak the truth if
[1:15:38] there's something in there to awaken
[1:15:39] that truth will awaken that that truth
[1:15:43] will awaken that and so when we read the
[1:15:45] scripture sometimes you say oh well
[1:15:46] Titus here he just says hey uh not by
[1:15:49] works but Paul says show me your faith
[1:15:51] by your works so will the Bible
[1:15:53] contradicts itself it takes Revelation
[1:15:55] to see what God is trying to say
[1:15:58] what is he saying between the lines and
[1:16:00] his love letter to us
[1:16:02] we can't just pull this scripture and
[1:16:04] run with it no we've got to have
[1:16:06] continuity through the scriptures
[1:16:08] appreciate it our brother Paul when he
[1:16:10] was praying in the back for the service
[1:16:12] this morning he said May the preaching
[1:16:14] come in continuity and that was it's
[1:16:15] exactly my heart's desire this morning
[1:16:17] but according to his Mercy he saved us
[1:16:19] by the washing of regeneration
[1:16:23] regeneration is the new birth
[1:16:25] and renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:29] in 1961 an uncertain sound he says no
[1:16:31] matter where they put you if you're born
[1:16:34] again and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:37] it might not be even enough Ashes to
[1:16:39] hold your little fingernail but she'll
[1:16:40] come forth again at the resurrection
[1:16:42] because you got life amen
[1:16:45] if you're born again and filled with the
[1:16:47] Holy Spirit
[1:16:48] the oil in the lamp the oil is the Holy
[1:16:51] Ghost
[1:16:52] where does that leave the foolish virgin
[1:16:54] I'm not going to go into that topic but
[1:16:55] but chew on that where does that lead
[1:16:58] the foolish version they don't have oil
[1:17:01] talks about this and and I'm going to
[1:17:04] bring it in and I'm going to tell you
[1:17:05] this morning that that my desire is just
[1:17:07] to preach it's just to bring the word
[1:17:08] and I know I keep saying that and you
[1:17:09] forgive me for my insecurities
[1:17:11] um but brother random talks about this
[1:17:13] this concept of stillborn and in birth
[1:17:16] pains 1965 he says that's what's the
[1:17:18] matter with the church today now how
[1:17:20] many know God's bringing a bride out of
[1:17:22] the church
[1:17:24] so the church is in birth pains not the
[1:17:26] denominations the message searches and
[1:17:28] birth pains why do you think there's so
[1:17:30] much so much uh
[1:17:32] um
[1:17:34] uh what I don't know what the word is so
[1:17:35] there's there's a lot you know what
[1:17:37] traveling and stuff there's a lot of
[1:17:39] bickering going on in the message
[1:17:41] as a whole
[1:17:43] there's a lot of this and a lot of that
[1:17:44] and it's just getting worse
[1:17:46] because it's birth pains
[1:17:49] the church the message search is in
[1:17:50] birth pain so don't get caught up in the
[1:17:52] birth pains but my wife you know has
[1:17:55] having a baby
[1:17:57] um first of all I Thank God I'm a man
[1:17:59] whenever that happens
[1:18:02] is he going through birth pains I don't
[1:18:03] go birth pains pains oh no pains pains
[1:18:05] pains no I'm looking pains means life is
[1:18:08] coming I'm looking I'm not I'm not
[1:18:10] focused on the pain she's having I'm
[1:18:12] saying honey you got this
[1:18:13] you got this
[1:18:15] you know I could always tell when she
[1:18:16] was just about ready
[1:18:18] and uh so tell you know she'd be like no
[1:18:19] no no no I'm like no it's almost there
[1:18:22] I'm not focused on birthday I'm not
[1:18:23] talking to the doctor you know she's in
[1:18:24] a lot of pain she's in the doctors and
[1:18:26] be like duh
[1:18:28] she's having a baby
[1:18:31] as children of god let's not get focused
[1:18:33] on the pains and the differences and and
[1:18:35] this person this church is Pentecostal
[1:18:37] so we go there and this church is is
[1:18:38] legalistic so we don't go there or this
[1:18:40] Church's legalization so we go there and
[1:18:41] this shirt Pentecostal so we go there
[1:18:43] we want the middle of the road we want
[1:18:46] the balance and you're gonna ask we're
[1:18:47] gonna find Christ and that's why you're
[1:18:49] not going to find confusion
[1:18:53] and I have to pray God help me not get
[1:18:55] caught up in that especially as a
[1:18:57] minister because God this is just the
[1:18:59] way God anointed the fivefold ministry
[1:19:00] I'm here you're there that's just
[1:19:02] because God planted that way but I'm
[1:19:05] still a man and if I get caught up in in
[1:19:07] preaching against Pentecostalism I am
[1:19:10] just as bad and if I get caught up in
[1:19:12] preaching against legalism I'm as just
[1:19:15] as bad I want to come the middle of the
[1:19:18] road and I want to preach the balance in
[1:19:20] the scriptures preach the word of God
[1:19:21] and I know that our I know that we all
[1:19:24] agree on that this morning that is where
[1:19:27] we'll find continuity so it's birthplace
[1:19:29] now get caught up in the birth pains
[1:19:30] look for the life look for the life
[1:19:32] that's coming because the bride will be
[1:19:34] what a reflection of Christ so when the
[1:19:38] church is done birthing
[1:19:40] what will that be the bride
[1:19:43] a perfect reflection of God Amen then
[1:19:46] we'll get out of here praise God
[1:19:48] and we won't have to argue anymore
[1:19:50] birth pains 1965. that's what's the
[1:19:52] matter with the church today the system
[1:19:54] we've got too many stillborn children
[1:19:58] that's right they need a gospel spanking
[1:20:01] you see and so to wake them up to bring
[1:20:03] them to themselves so that God can
[1:20:05] breathe the breath of life into them
[1:20:09] now we find that that's so true it's
[1:20:12] crude theology but it's the truth anyhow
[1:20:16] still born
[1:20:18] so there was water there was blood
[1:20:21] there's a baby born but it has no life
[1:20:25] natural always types the spiritual
[1:20:30] God's provided a way of approach to
[1:20:32] Fellowship 1960. I told you I have a lot
[1:20:34] of quotes I even gave brother Alex a
[1:20:36] heads up I said hey I got a ton of
[1:20:37] quotes and they're not going to come
[1:20:38] till right at 10.
[1:20:40] busting for putting all this together
[1:20:42] and everyone else back there in the
[1:20:44] sound team
[1:20:45] what come from Jesus's body when he died
[1:20:49] now what when Jesus died what was that
[1:20:52] the world was in birth pains
[1:20:55] he was causing A disruption
[1:20:59] and the enemy was trying to quiet that
[1:21:01] disruption
[1:21:03] people take that they run with that and
[1:21:05] they say anything I say in in defense
[1:21:08] against you and enough sense against you
[1:21:10] I'm causing disruption I'm in the will
[1:21:11] of God
[1:21:14] we are not Jesus
[1:21:17] he was perfectly in the will of God now
[1:21:21] if you're perfectly in the will of God
[1:21:22] you're causing disruption you're not
[1:21:24] going to be arrogant about
[1:21:25] you're going to be humble
[1:21:30] so
[1:21:32] when Jesus died
[1:21:34] he was
[1:21:35] moving he was transitioning
[1:21:39] to
[1:21:40] us receiving
[1:21:42] the Holy Spirit
[1:21:43] a comforter shall come
[1:21:48] so this was a birth the church was in a
[1:21:51] birth and they they thrust him in the
[1:21:53] side and he says he says um
[1:21:57] when he died
[1:21:58] what come from Jesus's body when he died
[1:22:00] blood and water
[1:22:03] so he says now then does the natural
[1:22:05] what does the natural birth consist of
[1:22:07] excuse me sisters and you young ladies I
[1:22:10] beg you'll forgive me but I want to make
[1:22:11] a statement when a baby is born a
[1:22:13] natural birth that's the first thing
[1:22:15] water second thing blood third thing
[1:22:18] spirit
[1:22:19] what come out of the body of Jesus water
[1:22:22] blood spirit
[1:22:25] because he Pat he passed away he died
[1:22:28] when a baby is born and it never cries
[1:22:30] it never moves there's something wrong
[1:22:32] with it
[1:22:33] it's what's called a stillbirth it's
[1:22:37] dead when it's born
[1:22:40] what happens the dogs are picked up by
[1:22:42] the heels shakes him and gives them a
[1:22:44] little few little spankings and the
[1:22:45] screen comes out life comes in what's
[1:22:50] the matter with the Pentecostal church
[1:22:51] tonight it needs what's the matter with
[1:22:53] the message church today it needs
[1:22:55] another gospel spanking that the Holy
[1:22:57] Ghost now that is not me coming up
[1:22:59] here and beating you across the head
[1:23:01] with the gospel stick
[1:23:03] no
[1:23:04] no it's the power there's power behind
[1:23:07] us
[1:23:09] there's power behind a spanking
[1:23:12] it gets a message across
[1:23:14] the Holy Spirit has power to bring life
[1:23:18] that's what he's saying when he says the
[1:23:19] church needs a good old-fashioned gospel
[1:23:21] spanking he's saying the church needs
[1:23:23] the power of the Holy Spirit to bring
[1:23:25] life
[1:23:30] amen what's the matter with the
[1:23:31] Pentecostal church today it needs
[1:23:33] another gospel spanking that the Holy
[1:23:34] Ghost shaking by the heels of the Gospel
[1:23:36] that life will enter into it again and
[1:23:39] it'll scream out to the Praises of God
[1:23:41] oh he is so wonderful
[1:23:45] a birth
[1:23:46] the spirit of God
[1:23:49] water blood spirit
[1:23:52] these three
[1:23:54] agree in one what is that one that's
[1:23:58] what is that one that is the new birth
[1:24:02] these three agree in one
[1:24:05] that's why you can have the baptisms of
[1:24:07] the Holy Spirit every day of your life
[1:24:08] and go to hell you can be baptized every
[1:24:10] day of your life and go to hell
[1:24:11] you can be Sanctified every day of your
[1:24:13] life and go to hell you need all three
[1:24:15] together
[1:24:16] in one for God to come recognize the
[1:24:19] faith that was produced in you when you
[1:24:22] were born again and seal you with the
[1:24:25] Holy Spirit
[1:24:27] see you don't that's that's right there
[1:24:30] you don't have to come up here and rip
[1:24:33] the carpet up
[1:24:34] an emotion that's right you have to do
[1:24:38] God
[1:24:39] what you do is you pray you say God
[1:24:42] I want the Holy Ghost
[1:24:45] you have faith right because if you're
[1:24:47] praying and asking for it you have faith
[1:24:52] that Born Again experience produced that
[1:24:54] faith in you now you have faith to call
[1:24:56] out for the holy spirit for the baptism
[1:24:59] of the holy spirit that will seal your
[1:25:01] life
[1:25:03] the faith you begin to cry out in that
[1:25:06] Faith guess what by time you come up to
[1:25:08] the altar you might already have it
[1:25:12] it's not one event
[1:25:14] right not everybody knows this day I got
[1:25:17] the Holy Ghost everybody just knows I'm
[1:25:20] not the same one I used to be
[1:25:21] everybody knows I'm not the same one I
[1:25:24] used to be not everybody knows exactly
[1:25:25] when it happened
[1:25:29] you see people come up on the and and
[1:25:32] see this is why I have to be careful
[1:25:34] because it sounds like I'm preaching
[1:25:36] against Pentecostalism I'm not
[1:25:40] I'm not now the experience but the brown
[1:25:42] said
[1:25:43] then a Revival dies does not come back
[1:25:48] Pentecost was for Pentecost today we
[1:25:51] want the bride it's Revival we want the
[1:25:53] word of God in our life
[1:25:55] but what does that mean
[1:25:57] go to the word and find out
[1:26:01] praise the Lord
[1:26:02] so now I want to take a minute to look
[1:26:04] at adoption
[1:26:06] in a hit in life 1955 brother Brown says
[1:26:08] this he says and remember the child no
[1:26:09] matter what whatever take place it was
[1:26:11] born a child
[1:26:13] it will always be a child I love how he
[1:26:15] just takes the simple example says if
[1:26:17] you're human you're going to act like a
[1:26:18] human
[1:26:19] if you're a normal human and you're born
[1:26:21] You're Gonna Act Like a human
[1:26:22] if your child of God and you're born
[1:26:24] again you're going to act like a child
[1:26:25] of God
[1:26:30] he says um okay born it'll always be a
[1:26:33] child and when a man is born of the Holy
[1:26:35] Ghost he becomes a child of God for it
[1:26:37] is actually a second birth a
[1:26:39] regeneration
[1:26:42] that creates something in the man that
[1:26:44] wasn't there to begin with
[1:26:46] see when you get a baptism of the Holy
[1:26:48] Spirit on your flesh nothing inside
[1:26:50] changed
[1:26:52] but when you get when you when you
[1:26:53] follow through and you are born again
[1:26:55] and the Holy Spirit testifies of that
[1:26:58] faith and you are sealed now something
[1:27:00] changes
[1:27:01] because the Lord sealed that faith so
[1:27:04] can't get away
[1:27:06] he knows our Humanity he knows our
[1:27:08] Humanity so he died on the cross to give
[1:27:10] us the opportunity to seal that faith in
[1:27:12] our hearts so nothing can take it away
[1:27:17] you can get to that position without the
[1:27:19] Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit has to
[1:27:20] come to seal that in your heart
[1:27:24] he says as a child and when a man is
[1:27:27] born of the Holy Ghost he becomes a
[1:27:28] child of God for it is actually a second
[1:27:29] birth okay
[1:27:31] that creates something in the man that
[1:27:33] wasn't there to begin with when every
[1:27:35] man is Born Into the household of faith
[1:27:37] he becomes a child then the Holy Spirit
[1:27:39] follows this man and brings word
[1:27:42] to God how he is progressing
[1:27:49] by God's grace I I don't have everything
[1:27:51] figured out but I'm preaching you today
[1:27:52] something I've wrestled with for years
[1:27:57] I'm just trusting the Lord that it would
[1:27:59] just be his word
[1:28:01] and the same message again he says now I
[1:28:03] believe that this is the time that the
[1:28:05] church has arrived at today that the
[1:28:08] great move in the church is for God
[1:28:09] after we've seen the false alarms but
[1:28:11] now God will place in his church
[1:28:13] correctly correctly Apostles prophets
[1:28:16] teachers evangelists not man-made
[1:28:19] Seminary bottom
[1:28:21] but God will place into the church so
[1:28:24] the previous quote he says then the Holy
[1:28:26] Spirit follows this man and brings word
[1:28:28] to God how he is progressing
[1:28:30] the teacher brings word to the father
[1:28:33] how his son is doing
[1:28:35] and then there's a moment in time where
[1:28:37] the father says he's ready for adoption
[1:28:40] when you were first born again guess
[1:28:42] what
[1:28:43] you were not ready for a position
[1:28:47] why is it that that
[1:28:49] Forgive Me Lord you're not you're not
[1:28:51] born an adult
[1:28:54] spiritually speaking you don't you're
[1:28:55] not born and boom you're an adult
[1:28:57] there's a growing time and and I've said
[1:29:00] this and by God's grace I I see this now
[1:29:02] in the word but I've said this that I
[1:29:04] believe every experience every believer
[1:29:05] has a desert experience that's a time in
[1:29:08] your life you'll walk through or you're
[1:29:10] growing to your position
[1:29:13] and you know this is what God has called
[1:29:15] me to do that's your position and it's
[1:29:18] it's easy to use the example of
[1:29:19] ministers because it's a it's an example
[1:29:22] but even ministers can start and they're
[1:29:24] still not in their position
[1:29:26] are you an evangelist are you an apostle
[1:29:28] are you a teacher are you a pastor what
[1:29:31] is your position and you got we're
[1:29:33] preaching this and we're this way and
[1:29:35] we're that we have to grow even as we're
[1:29:37] already in our ministry do we put to our
[1:29:40] position that God has called us to and
[1:29:42] in that process it is painful
[1:29:45] you as a child of God growing through
[1:29:48] your position in Christ because we all
[1:29:50] have a position
[1:29:52] is birth pains
[1:29:55] and God and the Holy Spirit is teaching
[1:29:57] you bringing that place where then God
[1:29:59] can say now they're in their position
[1:30:03] now that position individually speaking
[1:30:06] does not mean now it's time for the
[1:30:07] Rapture now you're in the vision God can
[1:30:09] begin to use your vessel
[1:30:13] Use Your Vessel when the bride
[1:30:15] collectively we all recognize at the
[1:30:17] same time
[1:30:18] wow
[1:30:21] you can't explain anyway so wow
[1:30:23] then we're out of here
[1:30:26] so he says
[1:30:28] uh but God will place into the church
[1:30:31] not theology run overs and overnights
[1:30:34] but God will place in the church as God
[1:30:36] has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tutored
[1:30:39] his church and raised it up
[1:30:42] and in there God will adopt into it
[1:30:44] adopt into his into the position his
[1:30:48] sons they're already his sons but
[1:30:51] whether they are worthy ready to catch
[1:30:54] this this boo me out of the water
[1:30:55] whether they are worthy of the position
[1:30:56] that he has for them
[1:31:00] you were not born an adult
[1:31:04] you have to grow you're in the position
[1:31:06] to grow
[1:31:08] that's why we was never become stagnant
[1:31:10] as Christians we must be watching
[1:31:13] cautious careful already becoming
[1:31:16] stagnant
[1:31:18] we we are called to a higher order
[1:31:22] we are not called to Camp down on one
[1:31:24] thing we are called to a higher order
[1:31:29] because we are going to make it
[1:31:33] we are going to make it
[1:31:35] Donna we're gonna make it one day you
[1:31:37] mean you're gonna be the same age
[1:31:40] brother Roman
[1:31:42] wait for the translation we're gonna
[1:31:43] make it
[1:31:46] or the Trevor
[1:31:47] we're gonna make it
[1:31:49] let's preach that way let's live that
[1:31:52] way when we see our brothers mistakes we
[1:31:53] say
[1:31:55] that's what we're gonna make it
[1:31:58] we need the difference in our lives so
[1:32:01] we can witness the difference to those
[1:32:03] around us God is looking for light to
[1:32:06] shine how can the light shine if there's
[1:32:08] confusion in our lives
[1:32:14] now I know we're at the hour mark
[1:32:16] but y'all I feel like y'all are still
[1:32:18] there so we'll keep going
[1:32:22] now in in 1951 I thought in the last
[1:32:26] days there's going to be two classes of
[1:32:28] people then that has the seal and the
[1:32:30] others will have the mark of the beast
[1:32:31] that's right so the Seal of God is the
[1:32:33] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:35] Ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy
[1:32:37] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:32:39] unto the day of redemption
[1:32:42] so that life breathes into the vessel
[1:32:45] you read that scripture and then you
[1:32:47] read that quote about being baptized
[1:32:48] with the Holy Spirit every day of your
[1:32:49] life and going to hell and you think but
[1:32:51] if I was contradicted with the scripture
[1:32:52] but when God says grieve out the holy
[1:32:54] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed so
[1:32:57] you've been sealed now that's not on the
[1:33:00] flesh that's something that's happened
[1:33:01] inside of you that God has sealed that
[1:33:03] Faith he has given you with the holy
[1:33:05] spirit it's a totally different position
[1:33:08] in Matthew 5 45
[1:33:11] I want to touch on this anointed ones
[1:33:16] I'm drawing by God's Great the Lord is
[1:33:19] I'm trying to get out of the way it's
[1:33:20] the Lord by the Lord can bring out this
[1:33:22] and because
[1:33:24] well I'm just going to read it Matthew 5
[1:33:26] 45 that they may be the children of your
[1:33:29] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:33:31] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:33:33] good and sendeth Reign on the just and
[1:33:36] on the unjust
[1:33:39] I was sitting in church one day and it
[1:33:40] just hit me the weed and I know this
[1:33:43] you're like whoa but the Chris you you
[1:33:44] you need to you know really learn more
[1:33:47] but you just have those epiphanies where
[1:33:49] you know it but then it just it just
[1:33:51] looks at it looks a little bit different
[1:33:53] and I was sitting there and I realized
[1:33:55] the weed and the wheat are growing from
[1:33:58] the same ground
[1:34:01] they're right next to each other they're
[1:34:04] growing from the same ground they're
[1:34:06] reacting the same way
[1:34:09] so how do we know
[1:34:11] how do we know well the wheat
[1:34:14] births the life
[1:34:17] of the wheat
[1:34:18] the weed birtheds the life of the weed
[1:34:22] amen that's right amen
[1:34:24] at the end time now they would not stand
[1:34:27] for that but false Christ false anointed
[1:34:29] ones almost with every sign and every
[1:34:31] letter of the word they believe baptism
[1:34:32] of the Holy Ghost absolutely
[1:34:35] believe in all this yep believe in
[1:34:37] speaking in tongues yep believe signs
[1:34:39] and wonders follow sides and wonders
[1:34:40] will follow them or signs will follow
[1:34:42] them yep that's not Methodist that's not
[1:34:43] Baptist no no that's message Believers
[1:34:46] see this is the last day
[1:34:51] again the same sermon Jesus said that
[1:34:53] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:34:55] now someone might say to me do you
[1:34:57] believe that the anointing of those
[1:34:59] people means that it's the anointing of
[1:35:00] the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy
[1:35:05] Spirit o God upon a person and yet they
[1:35:08] are false why what is false they're
[1:35:10] teaching
[1:35:12] they're teaching
[1:35:14] but it can be so close to the seed of
[1:35:17] elect if it was possible it's not these
[1:35:19] churches where they get up and they say
[1:35:20] brother branham's God
[1:35:24] we have matured beyond that point
[1:35:27] that is not close enough to deceive the
[1:35:29] very elect
[1:35:31] it's when a preacher gets up and he
[1:35:32] preaches a twisted sermon with his
[1:35:35] opinions mixed in
[1:35:38] you have to know the word and you have
[1:35:40] to find your position in the word and
[1:35:42] then when the minister gets up and he
[1:35:43] preaches under the anointing of the
[1:35:44] spirit and you hear it and maybe you're
[1:35:46] just like
[1:35:48] you open your heart and say God if
[1:35:50] that's you show me
[1:35:52] and you go back to the word of God
[1:35:54] I Marvel and I know it's the signs of
[1:35:56] the times and I know there's lots of
[1:35:57] excuses but we need to stop using the
[1:35:59] excuse that it's the flesh yeah right
[1:36:02] we have no excuse
[1:36:04] why do we have children
[1:36:07] and I'm partly guilty of this as my kids
[1:36:08] you know get older you you sometimes you
[1:36:10] you lag behind because you you look at
[1:36:13] them as they're still toddlers my my own
[1:36:15] daughter is old enough to start reading
[1:36:16] the Bible herself
[1:36:18] why is it that children are in their
[1:36:21] high school college and they don't even
[1:36:23] read their Bible
[1:36:25] they go to church Sunday Wednesday they
[1:36:27] go to all the youth meetings they go to
[1:36:29] the functions and they don't read their
[1:36:32] Bible
[1:36:33] that is the world that we live in today
[1:36:36] it is time for us to stand up and say we
[1:36:38] got to make a change I was on the plane
[1:36:40] coming back from Alaska and God just
[1:36:43] struck me and this is the burden God
[1:36:44] gave me now the burden God gives you is
[1:36:46] different
[1:36:47] burning God gave me we're running out of
[1:36:49] time and we're not doing enough
[1:36:54] why aren't we doing enough because we're
[1:36:55] not in our position so God's spending
[1:36:57] his time and we're spinning our wheels
[1:36:59] and God doesn't lose time
[1:37:01] so careful here careful here God don't
[1:37:04] waste time
[1:37:05] but God uses words like this stop
[1:37:08] messing around
[1:37:09] to provoke us into our position
[1:37:12] so stop messing around
[1:37:15] get in and get good
[1:37:17] so God can use you
[1:37:20] so Glock in his eye I say that in all
[1:37:22] love we all have we go through things
[1:37:25] and God walks us along in the footsteps
[1:37:27] of the righteous or order of the Lord
[1:37:28] keep on keeping on thanks to God
[1:37:34] he says now you can't make it any other
[1:37:37] way and understand this is the same I
[1:37:39] think the rest of these okay the next
[1:37:41] few quotes are the only two ones at the
[1:37:42] end time well you have it right there
[1:37:43] okay
[1:37:44] now you can't make it any other
[1:37:46] you can't make it another way and
[1:37:48] understand Matthew 20
[1:37:49] 24 he said these shall
[1:37:51] were false christs
[1:37:52] Christ is Anointed
[1:37:54] it's Jesus Christ he's the anointed one
[1:37:57] false anointed ones Anointed with the
[1:37:59] genuine thing but be false prophets of
[1:38:03] it false teachers of it the reasons no
[1:38:07] now he in this I think it's this sermon
[1:38:08] he talks about zedekiah
[1:38:10] in conflict with I think it was Jeremiah
[1:38:13] the problem was that akaya didn't know
[1:38:15] the word for his day
[1:38:17] there was Arya prophecy that they're
[1:38:19] going to go to Babylon
[1:38:22] for 70 years
[1:38:23] there already was a prophecy and
[1:38:25] zedekiah was trying to contradict that
[1:38:27] prophecy but he was anointed
[1:38:31] that right there should just clear it up
[1:38:35] what word are you hearing what word are
[1:38:38] you believing is it contradicting
[1:38:40] prophecy
[1:38:44] that's why I have a hard time and this
[1:38:46] is a little bit of brother Chris's
[1:38:47] opinion when people get so caught up in
[1:38:49] politics and they want to save America
[1:38:51] prophecy has been given now we got to do
[1:38:54] our best to shine a light to get as many
[1:38:56] here out us out of here with us as we
[1:38:58] can we're not going to save America
[1:39:00] that's right don't get caught up in the
[1:39:03] politics of today
[1:39:04] do not amen
[1:39:09] now
[1:39:10] the only ones at the end time Balaam
[1:39:12] Anointed with the same Spirit can you
[1:39:14] talk about this without bringing this
[1:39:16] guy up Balaam Anointed with the same
[1:39:18] spirit that was upon Moses what was the
[1:39:21] difference
[1:39:21] you see that's why you have to be
[1:39:22] careful he says it's the anointing it's
[1:39:24] the anointing it's the only thing it's
[1:39:25] not
[1:39:26] it's not it's the word
[1:39:30] is and now God will anoint you sometimes
[1:39:32] to shout and run the aisles God will
[1:39:34] anoint you sometimes to sit and listen
[1:39:36] what is God leading you but it's the
[1:39:38] anointing on the true seed that's what
[1:39:43] makes the difference it's not just
[1:39:44] anointing it's not just the water just
[1:39:46] the blood just the holy spirit it's all
[1:39:49] of that on the seed that God has placed
[1:39:52] in your life that is the difference
[1:39:54] I want to know the difference and I want
[1:39:56] to preach the difference because there's
[1:39:58] too much of the other stuff
[1:40:02] amen I want to witness the difference
[1:40:03] with my own life say wow
[1:40:06] wow amen
[1:40:09] I just think about God's grace
[1:40:11] in my own life
[1:40:13] some of you would have known me
[1:40:18] God's grace Balaam Anointed with the
[1:40:21] same spirit that was upon Moses what was
[1:40:23] the difference the teaching of Moses was
[1:40:24] perfect
[1:40:27] we have no excuse we are called unto
[1:40:29] Perfection stop saying well the flesh is
[1:40:33] weak but the spirit is willing stop even
[1:40:35] giving word to flesh
[1:40:38] don't even don't it just whatever get
[1:40:40] rid of that
[1:40:42] see it's not that easy I know I live
[1:40:44] with the flesh every day too
[1:40:46] but the word of God
[1:40:48] you see I had I had and now now once
[1:40:51] again once again this is stuff I already
[1:40:52] know already knew
[1:40:55] but I had this Epiphany I was back from
[1:40:57] a trip and I was tired and I had been
[1:41:00] been studying for like a month every day
[1:41:02] just really heavy topic I just need a I
[1:41:06] need to chill you know
[1:41:07] something just chill and the Lord spoke
[1:41:10] to me said chilling is not going to
[1:41:13] strengthen you
[1:41:15] you need a tape
[1:41:17] I thought oh you're right
[1:41:19] put on a tape and I was in I was
[1:41:23] strengthened amen
[1:41:25] and strengthened the world the world
[1:41:27] wants us especially for men you know we
[1:41:28] love to just have a nothing box as they
[1:41:30] call it
[1:41:31] the world has plenty of nothing boxes
[1:41:33] for us to sit in we got games we got
[1:41:35] YouTube we've got you know hunting blogs
[1:41:38] and fishing blogs and fishing magazines
[1:41:41] and all of that stuff we can get
[1:41:43] ourselves lost in and we can dream and
[1:41:45] but that doesn't strengthen us
[1:41:48] that doesn't strengthen us going fishing
[1:41:50] can strengthen you
[1:41:53] you're spending time with God
[1:41:57] sisters
[1:42:00] but that's what the devil wants to pull
[1:42:02] you away from God
[1:42:05] because you know what if you chill
[1:42:06] that's the world would say Netflix and
[1:42:09] chill
[1:42:11] I don't have a Netflix subscription
[1:42:15] the rule would say that
[1:42:17] but that doesn't when you do that you
[1:42:19] just feel like you need to chill more
[1:42:22] because you're a child of God and all
[1:42:24] that stuff just brings you down
[1:42:27] amen amen enough said there
[1:42:31] the teaching of Moses was perfect the
[1:42:33] Bible said here in second Peter that it
[1:42:34] was the teaching of Balaam that Israel
[1:42:36] received that God never did forgive it
[1:42:39] wasn't that what happened it was the
[1:42:41] teachings they received that God never
[1:42:44] forgave unpardonable sin not a one of
[1:42:47] them got saved though they had come out
[1:42:49] under the blessings of God Red Sea
[1:42:53] justification
[1:42:55] the desert experience sanctification
[1:42:59] but they received the wrong teaching
[1:43:01] they were Seated on teaching they were
[1:43:03] still born Israelites the hand of God
[1:43:05] moving by this Mighty prophet and seen
[1:43:07] it exactly Vindicated by God
[1:43:12] I just want to touch on this real quick
[1:43:14] here regeneration and we'll get to to
[1:43:16] the ending
[1:43:19] the scripture there's a scripture in
[1:43:21] Titus did we read it already we did
[1:43:23] where he says regeneration
[1:43:26] in preparation 1953 says but brother
[1:43:28] it's got to take the Holy Spirit a new
[1:43:30] birth a regeneration
[1:43:32] a new creature in Christ Jesus when God
[1:43:34] comes down and puts his Spirit into you
[1:43:36] then you're no more your own but you're
[1:43:37] gods or begin to feel religious already
[1:43:40] and you know what a birth is God's
[1:43:41] provided way it's a regeneration a new
[1:43:45] creation a man becomes a new creation in
[1:43:47] Christ and by accepting his own word and
[1:43:50] Titus 3 5 says
[1:43:53] not by works okay by Mercy but by the
[1:43:55] washing of regeneration and renewing of
[1:43:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:44:01] so um
[1:44:06] uh hear ye him he that believeth not is
[1:44:09] condemned already before you even get
[1:44:10] started you're condemned you're born and
[1:44:12] sin shaped and iniquity come to the
[1:44:14] world speaking lies no matter how much
[1:44:17] he was dedicated on the altar how many
[1:44:18] times you were sprinkled baptized poor
[1:44:20] whatever it is you're still a sinner
[1:44:22] that's all until you repent and God
[1:44:24] until you repent it doesn't stop it says
[1:44:27] and God recognizes and seals that
[1:44:30] promise with the Holy Spirit
[1:44:32] the Born Again experience produces faith
[1:44:36] in your heart God recognizes that faith
[1:44:38] and you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:40] Spirit sealed unto the day of your
[1:44:42] Redemption that's right he says then
[1:44:43] you're born again then your son and
[1:44:45] daughter's daughter of God it's a
[1:44:47] regeneration a new creation then your
[1:44:49] attributes now here's what you have to
[1:44:51] focus on
[1:44:53] my wife we were talking about something
[1:44:54] the other day and she said you have
[1:44:55] doubts and I said yes and she started to
[1:44:57] get worried
[1:44:58] and I said but the word says this amen
[1:45:01] and that's where I stand amen
[1:45:04] amen you can have doubts on your flesh
[1:45:05] and still be a saved Sanctified
[1:45:07] blood-filled on fire Son of God
[1:45:10] amen because you stand on the word
[1:45:13] what is the foundation of a perfect man
[1:45:15] the word faith
[1:45:17] faith
[1:45:18] faith is knowing your position in Christ
[1:45:24] your daughter of God it's regeneration a
[1:45:25] new creation then your attributes your
[1:45:28] thoughts are not like they were your
[1:45:29] life is not like it was you become a
[1:45:31] complete surrendered vessel to God see
[1:45:33] it's the attributes that testify of the
[1:45:35] work God has done the attributes of God
[1:45:37] and he speaks and uses you and you're
[1:45:39] not your own no more but you're bought
[1:45:41] with a price that's the price of the
[1:45:43] Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:46] okay
[1:45:49] trying to find a place to wrap this up
[1:45:50] this morning
[1:45:51] or get get to the get to the Crux
[1:45:56] he says
[1:45:58] I don't believe that sir Morgan Church
[1:46:00] age I believe uh 1960 the sermon he
[1:46:03] preaches on submarine Church age I
[1:46:04] believe regeneration comes by the blood
[1:46:05] of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit
[1:46:07] that's right baptism is only an outward
[1:46:09] Act to the inward work of regeneration
[1:46:12] he's talking about Oneness people how
[1:46:13] they believe that when you get baptized
[1:46:14] that's your regeneration but he says
[1:46:16] that's not what it how it is so now
[1:46:19] let's wrap this up by God's grace
[1:46:22] Israel in the church number two notice
[1:46:24] three stages three stages three stages
[1:46:26] justification by faith sanctification
[1:46:29] through the blood baptism of the Holy
[1:46:31] Spirit
[1:46:32] next quote God always does things in
[1:46:35] threes god is perfect in three he is
[1:46:37] perfect
[1:46:40] he is perfect and father son Holy Spirit
[1:46:42] he is perfect in justification
[1:46:44] sanctification
[1:46:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit he is
[1:46:50] perfected in his threes
[1:46:52] we are in his making so we are perfected
[1:46:55] in three yeah yeah soul body spirit and
[1:46:59] your body is controlled of nerves of
[1:47:02] blood and of cells flesh three all
[1:47:04] perfected in three
[1:47:06] expectations next quote when you are
[1:47:08] born again
[1:47:10] and the baptism of the Holy Spirit has
[1:47:12] come into your heart
[1:47:14] you have everything that you have need
[1:47:16] of for the journey amen 1965 leadership
[1:47:20] the choice of your conduct you can't mix
[1:47:23] it now you're either for God or against
[1:47:26] God and the outward expression shows
[1:47:28] exactly what's on the inside
[1:47:32] many of you think I got the baptism of
[1:47:35] the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that
[1:47:36] don't mean one thing that you're going
[1:47:37] to heaven no sir you can have the
[1:47:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[1:47:41] your life and still be lost go to hell
[1:47:46] say what is it wow what can we do be
[1:47:49] born again amen
[1:47:52] the key to the door 1962 so communion is
[1:47:55] for Christians
[1:47:57] that's born again of the spirit of God
[1:48:00] Born Again does not necessarily mean now
[1:48:03] that you got the Holy Ghost now remember
[1:48:05] now many you many teach that I don't
[1:48:08] know anybody that teaches it like this
[1:48:09] but as old brother organ fight said that
[1:48:11] night from the pulpit but new Birds is
[1:48:13] not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:48:15] scripture doesn't support it I don't
[1:48:17] think see the way am I seeing it say
[1:48:19] whoa brother Chris
[1:48:21] hold on
[1:48:23] we read we've read a bunch of quotes a
[1:48:26] bunch of scriptures where he says the
[1:48:28] new birth brings the faith produces in
[1:48:32] you the faith for receiving the baptism
[1:48:34] of the Holy Spirit you can't have the
[1:48:37] new birth without the baptism of the
[1:48:40] Holy Spirit but you can have the baptism
[1:48:41] of the Holy Spirit without the new birth
[1:48:45] he says an influence of another I don't
[1:48:47] believe in being born again is the
[1:48:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not the
[1:48:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being
[1:48:52] reborn again we're reborn by the blood
[1:48:55] blood cell comes from that now we read
[1:48:57] quotes everybody now says it's the blood
[1:48:59] that brings the birth child is born it's
[1:49:01] water it's blood then Spirit comes in
[1:49:04] but they're born
[1:49:06] the spirit needs a body to inhabit
[1:49:09] your their Spirit body you need to you
[1:49:11] need a birth for the spirit to inhabit
[1:49:13] it's being reborn again we're reborn by
[1:49:16] the blood blood cell comes from I mean
[1:49:18] life still comes from the blood you're
[1:49:20] baptized the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:49:23] but you're born by the blood absolutely
[1:49:26] you're born by the blood of your father
[1:49:28] I am Born Again by The Blood of My
[1:49:31] Father by your Our Father Christ
[1:49:34] it is the rising of the sun he says if
[1:49:36] that ain't my message exactly today
[1:49:38] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:49:41] of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] and I was saying that a person has to
[1:49:45] come by these three steps to be able to
[1:49:48] walk that highway so when we say You
[1:49:50] must be born again we're not saying come
[1:49:52] up and get the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:54] Spirit we're saying go the process water
[1:49:57] blood spirit
[1:49:59] you see where the confusion is what
[1:50:01] happens is you you get an experience the
[1:50:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit on you and it
[1:50:05] falls on you and your life doesn't
[1:50:07] change and you wonder I missed it or you
[1:50:09] go away thinking God doesn't keep his
[1:50:11] word
[1:50:13] but what you want is you want God to
[1:50:15] recognize the faith inside of you that
[1:50:17] produce that's produced by the birth
[1:50:19] then God fills you with the Holy Spirit
[1:50:22] you can ha you can't have the birth
[1:50:24] without the Holy Ghost but you can have
[1:50:26] the Holy Spirit without the birth we
[1:50:28] just read the quote baptism of the Holy
[1:50:30] Spirit on your flesh on you every day of
[1:50:32] your life and still go to hell
[1:50:34] now in in closing here
[1:50:37] birth pains he says and it proves beyond
[1:50:39] the shadow of a doubt what Luther's
[1:50:41] message was justification what
[1:50:43] sanctification is the next process is
[1:50:46] the natural birth birth and then come
[1:50:49] the Pentecostals exactly
[1:50:53] now remember
[1:50:55] I didn't preach any of my opinions
[1:50:58] I've read the quotes
[1:51:01] now God has to do the rest
[1:51:04] I was struggling with with preaching
[1:51:07] along these lines and and I've already
[1:51:09] I've already talked to the Paul some
[1:51:11] time ago
[1:51:12] and I and I open my bible and I saw this
[1:51:15] sticky note I put here last weekend it
[1:51:17] says easy has the cost
[1:51:19] are you willing to pay the price
[1:51:21] the Bible says his yoke is easy and his
[1:51:24] burden is life there's a price we have
[1:51:25] to pay
[1:51:26] surprised that we have to pay him God
[1:51:28] calls us to do something he says do my
[1:51:30] will and afterwards Brother David read
[1:51:31] the scripture afterwards receive the
[1:51:34] promise I pray this morning there would
[1:51:36] not be any any kind of confusion that we
[1:51:38] would know that it's it's it's the new
[1:51:41] birth
[1:51:42] and that God has given us a plan to get
[1:51:44] to that position
[1:51:45] and it's not what experience we had
[1:51:48] it's what does our life reflect and I
[1:51:51] believe if our life reflects the word we
[1:51:54] are sealed the day of our Redemption now
[1:51:56] we're in the position to grow to come to
[1:51:58] that position where God can adopt us and
[1:52:01] use us for his glory let's bow our heads
[1:52:05] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:52:07] for your word this morning Lord
[1:52:11] I pray Lord Jesus as the saying goes
[1:52:16] a plant we water
[1:52:18] but
[1:52:20] the the life comes from you or somewhere
[1:52:22] along those lines they might have said
[1:52:23] that wrong but God you give the increase
[1:52:27] Lord father we know that
[1:52:30] we want to be in a position as as
[1:52:31] Believers I want to be in position as
[1:52:33] Believers and to receive your word
