this service to him bless you brother george have your liberty good evening it's good to be here yeah and we trust that everyone is awake and um hungry for a part of the word now according to my figures i was last here in um looks like february of last year and so we were going through the book of acts and you probably forgot about it already we're not going to start up chapter one again but we could um but as you're seated there just open your bibles to chapter 18 of the book of acts and i may read out of more than one bible because we have king james version we've had since you know about 500 years now and we have uh the lambs a bible some of you students have heard about that and uh it's a very good translation has just a little more salsa let's say in some areas so it it helps to understand maybe but anyway um i'm thankful that brother paul has invited me out and we need to pray for our brother he's got the ox in the ditch he's trying to get it going again so you understand him better than i do but i'm just glad to be here also and we've been in a lot of places i was sick with covert last year but i'm well now immune lord willing i'll be going to south africa in july but for now we're here and we want to um just approach the word of the lord and see what he has for each one of us let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for this occasion we can be together we thank you lord for this beautiful group of people we pray that you should bless them and lord may you minister to them only the way you know how to as we look into your word give us grace lord bless brother paul bless each one lord that's out or pray that you should bless them bring them in tomorrow help us now in jesus name amen so in the book of acts we have um the history of the early church these are our people this is our church back there where it started and it's come through a couple thousand years and a lot of trials and tribulations but um uh we look back so that we can see the foundation again it's fine to re you know relish what we have now where did this come from how did it how did we get this far and um brother branham says over 200 times back to the word so we have authority to go and look into his um we call it absolute and see what god has for us so in chapter 18 we have paul and silas his trusted associate and they're in the midst of their second missionary journey now and the date is about 49 a.d and paul at this point has already written his letter to the galatians and um also the letter to the 12 tribes which is known as the epistle of james in our bible right after hebrews and so all this is going on i used to think that all the letters that paul wrote were written from prison but they're not they're written from along the way sometimes you got letters hey what about this what about that and so he had to uh find the mind of the lord to um you know to write to them so in verse 1 of chapter 18 and it came to pass that while apollos was in corinth 19 chapter 18. after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth now we're going to go through this slowly so you can understand and see where we're at now corinth is about 20 miles west of athens it was a city well known for idolatry very bad reputation amongst the citizens and on the edge of the city was a great temple built to the goddess diana complete with women priests and every kind of perversion so we're not going to go into all that but you can imagine and this was one of the reasons that paul seemed to be so heavy-handed against women because there was a lot of bad things going on and just like in our day brother brennan wasn't screaming at the ladies and screaming at the women you know and uh many of them were completely out of their place they were doing every ungodly thing and um but paul was sure about what he preached see because he received it by revelation from god now in the church age book on chapter 1 paragraph 98 brother ram says we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world from the 16 year old to the seven-year-old to all of us that is the most important thing call on god for revelation he says we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truths of it but we still it is still not real to most people because the revelation of the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened all up down the street we've got nice churches and they all have this same bible and they probably know it a lot better than some of us but we need to you know ask god for more revelation because then when we get to galatians 1 and 8 if you look at that very uh quickly galatians 1 8 as we read it from the lamsa bible here is the fact that we have the truth but um paul was writing to this new church over there in verse six i'm surprised how soon you have turned to another gospel away from christ who has called you by his grace so they knew the grace of christ they've been converted but now they were being attracted to something else he goes on and says a gospel which does not even exist how be it there are men who have stirred you up and want to pervert the gospel of christ but though we that's he silas paul george whoever though we or an angel even from heaven comes down and preaches any other gospel to you than that which we have already preached to you let him be accursed so there's no grace there's no getting along there's no let's have coffee no it's either gospel or it's to the hot place two choices verse nine in case you missed it the first time as i said before so i i guess i say again if any man preaches any other gospel to you than that which you have received let him be accursed so we don't have to wonder what that means um god's word is our basis it's not because brother branham said so not because this or that because the word says so so paul had to deal with a generation of women out of control living way beyond scriptural brown bounds and brother brown faced the same thing you see so that's why it seems a lot of his preaching was against women well you remember the story of cinderella there's only one person in the shoe fit that's right so in the message choosing of a bride a sentence here that you probably never heard before he says but if she can hold herself right that means balanced in every way and yes i did not forget to bring a level still good okay if she can hold herself right balanced you know modest apparel eyes on calvary what a greater reward she has than a man oh where'd that come from doesn't come from some of the churches i met at greater rewards she has than a man she is put on a testing ground so that's for you ladies in particular and the bride in general you see so there's a continuity to the word of god and the spirit of god working in the seven messengers but we especially appreciate the similarities between the first messenger and the seventh messenger see because see hebrews 13 8 is still in effect amen now it was easy to believe when brother branham was standing here and yeah same yesterday today oh yeah it looks the same and tomorrow who knows well we're there we're tomorrow now that's right so there's a there's a group of people that is reflecting hebrews 13 8 today see and so um he's still the same and it'll be seen in followers of the true word not in followers of personalities we've been there you know because in the scripture it it has room for all that in horsing in genesis 1 every seed after its kind so the baptists are only going to produce baptists the big church you know headquarters in utah they're only going to produce those kind of people but we're here to encourage you to live the word amen okay we've got another place here where brother man speaks 1955 a few nights ago in prayer in a prayer meeting a man said to me the holy ghost was only given to the twelve of the day of pentecost i said well then what about the 120th that was there at the same time received it how about down to the house of cornelius and we've covered that in chapter 10 i believe was and 33 years later paul asked the baptist if they had received the holy ghost since they believed he laid hands on them and they received the holy ghost setting the church in order in corinth okay he also said uh in the church apostles prophets teachers evangelists gifts of healing all that's part of the word you know it didn't go away and all those marvelous gifts beyond years and years beyond pentecost well then so it is today with every believer go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that's the general orders you see it it didn't go away and so how far all the world people like david i've been there some of those places you know how many all the people he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so you got to start at the cross not start with the you know seal book or marriage and divorce no you start at the cross okay he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils heal the sick and so forth there you are it's god's promise that he swore he would do it no matter how much you know rises up to try to counterfeit to impersonate it or how many things raise up to try to contradict it or take it down it will go on and on and on god has sworn by himself that he would keep it so remember though we or even an angel comes down right here wow got to believe what he said really they'd better say what the word says right and you better know what the word says you'll be swept away you see and so that's why it's important to me to look into what paul said because when brother brahma had the experience of beyond the curtain of time it was all based on the fact that paul preached the truth amen those of us that were there i'm sorry but not everybody's carrying these books is going okay that's right but if you're serious you know you're plugged in god will take you but those of us that were there beyond the curtain of time um when brother brown was asked you know he said you got to be judged what you preached well he didn't start biting his fingernails and worrying immediately what about paul well he'll be judged also well if his people make it in my people make it because i preached exactly what paul preached and we all said we're depending on that amen not that you knew the secrets not all these other things but you preach what paul preached okay amen 18 verse 2. and so he said corinth and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy and his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all the jews to depart from rome and so he came into them and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for um by their occupation they were tent makers okay so this couple aquila and priscilla man and wife they were jews and they had a crap they knew how to do things they made tents so they had this trade and the manufacturer of affordable mobile buildings will say for working for living for traveling like travel trailers or you know economical rvs and so we'll find this couple later in a lot more of the study but uh in verse 4 paul went to church when the doors were open on their worship day the sabbath and he spoke only to jews and greeks because jesus said back in matthew 10 i believe it is go only to the house of israel not sure everybody would like you know we'd like to preach the gospel to everybody but he said go only to the house of israel but even in the old testament he says you know talks about the gentiles and the new testament how that paul will go to the gentiles but first the house of israel so he only went to them and so finally um in verse five his helpers arrived from up north and but the opposition was real great you know and uh it says paul was pressed in the spirit one translation says that he was not free to speak because the jews opposed him and blasphemed as he testified that jesus is the christ so see that was their message at the time it wasn't jesus said and jesus said no they already had a bible that was 200 years old the translation excuse me and so the the priests the one people that could read they knew their bible and to all paul his message was this is the fulfillment of the scriptures y'all memorized see that's what he was doing and so um at this point in the in the in the story here in acts 18 um it was a real turning point for paul he had worked hard endured opposition beatings prison and now open blasphemy against the name of jesus christ you know so he shook the dust off his coat and he said over here in verse six and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his reign shook the dust off and said them your blood be upon your own heads i'm clean in other words i'm finished with you people from here on i'm going to the gentiles he's had it you know there's there's a breaking point and so um sometimes you just got to push delete and go on you know there's no uh there's no repair sometimes so um you know we would like for everybody and our relatives and everybody to uh to hear the truth believe the truth and live in peace with god but some people are just not cut out for it you know they're after another kind sorry and um you go you go trying to press it on them they will make you miserable and eventually they will blaspheme you because you didn't know when to stop you know so we got to move on we can only help those that ask for help now when you're in the ministry it's a very difficult thing because we can see a situation we've been through this before or god has showed us something and we know how to give them some advice but we've got to when they ask for help then we can help verse 7 and he departed thence and entered into a certain man's house and his name was justice okay so he moved on uh and this is one that worshipped god his house it says here joined heart of the synagogue that means he shared a wall he lived right there next you know he was the next department right there and um and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized that's good then spake the lord to paul in the night by vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city now that's good you got a direct word from god oh don't leave there's things to do here and so um and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them so here he is 18 months in corinth getting the church in order preaching the word by permission you know vision of the lord so 12 through 17 once again we have the fanatical religious jews took paul into court this guy is persuading men to worship god contrary to the law he was only showing christ from the word he wasn't contrary to the law the law was good had its time but it had a fulfillment and so um they they were upset but he's only showing you know the god that they said they knew but they had no revelation right just like brother brown said in the church age book we we're sure the bible is right but we got to have revelation to make it work you know and so when the judge realized it was not a civil case but a religious issue he dismissed them all you know go home verse 14. um paul's when paul was about to open his mouth um galileo said unto the jews if this was a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness you jews reasoned that that i would bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and your law you'll take care of it i won't be a judge in such matters you drove them out of the court out of here you know and so um the greek citizens were really upset because they wanted they wanted somebody to you know they wanted blood and um and so what they do they beat up one of the rulers of the synagogue the law did nothing just kind of look the other way sounds like downtown here right yeah louisville everywhere else yeah same spirit so in verse 18 paul heads off to syria stop over in ephesus and he left aquila and priscilla in ephesus and they were very instrumental in forming the local church in rome in corinth emphasis a great husband and wife team and if you haven't seen the the film paul apostle of jesus christ it's available on dvd it's right there on your phone you can buy it it's very very good righteous jerry okay needed amen that's all verse 24 and a certain jew named apollos born in alexandria eloquent man mighty in the scripture came to ephesus so he's preaching through there and this man says he was instructed in the way of the lord and being uh fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john so up to there he was really good at what he was saying and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue who when aquila and priscilla heard him they took him home for dinner and expounded him more perfectly the way of god and when he was disposed to pass unto asia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help them with which he believed through grace for he mightily convinced the jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ see that was their message okay so meanwhile back you know uh ephesus they uh they helped brother apollos because you know he lacked in in revelation but um the light had moved on he just wasn't aware of it you know now in alexandria uh it's still there today it's it's port city in egypt and that's where the more readable user-friendly greek translation was made of the old testament um probably 200 years before christ so greek was the trade language of the day see like english yesterday maybe and that would have been the bible that peter was quoting from uh and used by many others and uh even to this day it's the bible used by the greek orthodox church they don't get confused the greek orthodox church is based in istanbul turkey and it's simply the eastern half of the church of the catholic church rome is the headquarters of the western church and there was one church until they couldn't agree on doctrine and he divided in the year 1054. and just recently the two heads got together you know it'll all be one church eventually okay so uh um 26 which i think already read here yeah they spoke boldly and so forth so more precisely the revelation of the word of the day which they lived they weren't living in the glare of another day they were living in present tense see god is revealing self in present tense we're still under the umbrella of the seventh messenger you see all god's word is true but there's a period it's something allotted for each period it's just divided up and so we're under that umbrella we love all the word but the goal that we have today isn't looking for that seventh messenger because he was already here i knew him personally so he was here left us something to work with and um but the message today is looking for the exit of laodicea it's right out here you know we're leaving so the message continued to be the same and apollos was preaching the same as paul showing publicly by the scriptures that jesus was the christ so later god would reveal some other doctrines to him so now we get into chapter 19 so apollo says holy meetings in corinth paul is traveling you know into had contact with the believers in emphasis uh emphasis at that time would have been a city of possibly 350 000 people maybe the size of louisville or something a big city and um so priscilla and aquila they were there with their tent making and so uh chapter 19 verse 2 and he said unto them you know he found these other disciples over there he said have you all received the holy ghost since you believed and they said we don't know anything about that never heard about it and he said to them unto what were you baptized and they said john's baptism that's all the light they had now they could have said and we don't want to hear no more thank you leave but they knew there was more see then said paul john verily baptized with baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus that's who i'm here to tell you about see and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of jesus in the name of the lord jesus okay so um and when paul had laid his hands on them the holy ghost came to them and they speak with tongues and prophesied and most people only go that far and you thought it was 150 people it was 12 people and it's right there okay so they were perfectly carrying out the pattern of acts 2 the day of pentecost here's great missionary paul baptizing a small group of 12 people and the same was done at each baptism throughout the entire book of acts all through the bible as they spread the gospel in the name of the lord jesus christ up until the catholic church changed the to the original words of the trinitarian words of jesus in the year 325 so the baptism remains simple and pure in the name of jesus christ for over 300 years and for most of these other 1700 years the prevailing teaching has been and continues to be in the precise words of jesus christ from matthew 28 19 which anybody that reads that well what is the name it's not in the name no in the name so they do it without revelation and so the roman church despises revelation we all have friends we got relatives they don't want to hear about revelation they want just what it says and we don't hear no more well you're cutting yourself off from a blessing so god rich in mercy sent us a prophet in the 20th century and to open our eyes our understanding so we know god by his word and by revelation now you may get some revelation without the word but it's going to be pretty narrow so this whole thing this study is designed you go and read the bible for yourself because we're going to jump over some of your favor verses guaranteed so you read and god will reveal himself by his word so paul stayed here um in the area over two two years which is that verse 10 of 19 says here and he continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks well we'll just reduce that to the predestinated because you know it didn't all here but the ones were ordained to hear it they did okay so i would suggest that you read very carefully chapter three of the uh church age book lots of details you see and in speaking of the early church brother ram says on page 86 their persecutions and trials which they had a lot their persecutions and trials and patience weren't they were over the name the blessed name of jesus you know that is not all strange for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that mighty word which was manifested in healing signs and wonders and other demonstrations like we've seen right here in acts 19 11 caused the pharisees to scream out for the death of the true believers and now that name hated and despised by the jews here is mocked by the culture you know important arrogant people as they laugh to think that anyone could be so foolish as to believe in a man who died and rose again and now seated in heaven so here were the religious persecutors the jews cursing this jesus which caused paul to leave corinth remember who to them was not he was a false messiah and here were the others laughing with the light mocking sarcastically at the name of a new god who to them wasn't a god at all so you see why okay you only put up so much of this now here's something else that started in that age and we'll continue right down through the ages and getting deeper and darker that his people were repudiating that name that means refuse to recognize to reject people were repudiating that name it was not that the true ephesian church that was doing it no sir it was the false apostles but they were using some of the same words see everybody has these spoken word books didn't go into heaven some were using for wrong purposes it was the outsider trying to get in and defiled the believers the ephesians knew that name and they loved it and that's where we've been brought back to to the name that's right it's all through the book of acts brother madam also says over here in the his uh this great servant moses now as moses went with that judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is jesus christ if the egyptians could have ever got that little simple stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can ever get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he's got the church whip and it's happening because we've got people in pulpits tonight and tomorrow that using some of this same word but they're removing the deity out they're putting it over here in this man in this organization and no power it's happening so it's still all about the name of jesus christ just like luther said a long time ago christ alone so that's a message for another day so verse 11 of chapter 19 uh we won't be here too much later but uh let's see here chap and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul okay so they had signs and wonders just like we have today and i remember the first time we went to rome um we had this woman guide she was showing us around and we came to you know paul's grave and here's a like a gravestone maybe the size of this pulpit but it's it's broke you know it's in pieces and so um of course me not revelated i guess uh i said whites are broken oh she said for centuries people used to come by here with a string and a handkerchief and a rock and they would tuck around and let it till it hit and then they bring it out and go late on somebody so even after death they were laying you know uh things were happening and um and so it was just a marble slab you know they just said apostle paul martyr so in the year 2000 they began work to bring the sarcophagus up from where it was that way down low make it accessible now you walk right up to it they're one of the churches in rome so um verse um 13-20 we have what's called the vagabond jews these were some bad boys that thought they were going to do some you know great things they were like freelance they weren't orthodox and there was a man named siva the chief priest among the jews it's all right there in the scripture and he knew his prophet's words very well see they didn't have no ipad or nothing they had to read and memorize you know and so he knew his prophets well he had seven sons they were into to exercising exercising evil spirits i mean you know removing and casting out and they heard about the success of paul up there in verse 11 you know special miracles and they thought you know we should try that yeah so they found a man with an evil spirit he was actually insane and in verse 13 we adjure you in the name of jesus whom paul preaches see they were not witnesses they were wannabes verse 15 and the evil spirit answered to them jesus i know and paul i know who are you guys and the man in whom the evil spirit was now this sir here's this man this insane man spirits in him so it says that that spirit that guy leaped on these seven guys overcame them and prevailed and they fled the house naked and wounded that's pretty powerful spirit against seven guys but that's what was happening so in the midst of all that confusion verse 17 and this was known to all the jews and greeks dwelling in ephesus and fear came upon them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified thank you and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds all so now we're going to have a cleansing yeah so such a conviction in their hearts or what they'd seen that day due to the reality of christ in his word that many of them verse 19 also which used curious arts that's like magic and like crystal ball and all that kind of stuff brought their books together and burned them had a big downtown big big book burning probably say in spanish better than rhyme and uh they burned them before all men and they counted the price of them that found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver okay that's the only way to get rid of evil spirits is a burning you don't put it in the yard sale and you know bless somebody else no you burn it so um they were serious about following the way of jesus christ you see not optional or popular but they were convicted by the holy ghost preaching and they got really serious now i had a friend up in bc when i lived up there many years ago he was a new convert there was a logger no big ol guy and so um he come to the lord and he had a big collection of big lp discs you know nice to them at the time it was nice stuff it was pretty heavy rock and roll it's what it was and so just a few weeks before somebody had offered me three thousand dollars for this collection but when you come to the lord he took his 24 inch chainsaw went through the whole mess and burned it just like these guys they were serious so it says here the value of the books was equivalent of it says 50 000 piece of silver so that would be equivalent to 50 000 days wages for one man or about the equivalent of 10 men's wages for 14 years so once what they once thought was valuable and a way of life was now trash in the fire brother bran preaches the same thing in the token in desperation and a few other places get rid of it you see so anything that was contrary to jesus christ went into the fire they were serious they applied they applied the token for real and satan was on the scene but verse 20 so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed so with all this going on what's going on here verse 23 at the same time there arose no small stir about that way well yeah this is going to cause quite a bit of confusion you put all this these books all this stuff in the fire and everybody's seeing it so it caused no small wave there's no small stir here in the way because a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana uh brought no small gain into the craftsman so it was a big business you know and um because you know in john 14 6 i am the way the truth of life no man cometh to the father but by me and that one word kind of stuck with him the way you know and uh so now demetrius and his his uh people they're ray upset and um so when this is going on with the twins showed up and these guys are making idols and he was a silversmith and um see the they call it the temple of diana that was the roman name the artemis was the greek name and so they had a union meeting to discuss their future verse 25 when he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sir you know that by this craft we have our wealth moreover you see that here that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all of asia this guy paul has persuaded and turned away many people saying that there be no no gods which are made with hands in other words you know our business is going out it's bad news so that not only our craft is in danger to be said it not but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world is worshiping which is serious and when they heard these things they were all filled with wrath they were upset and they cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians but it was a silver idol it was nothing mexico is full of it and a lot of other places verse 29 and the whole city was filled with confusion having caught gaius and aristichus men of macedonia paul's companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theater in other words the court so in verses 6 12 and 17 we got great blessings of god the name of the lord jesus was magnified but now in verse 29 there's mass confusion and it took two christians into custody and then brought them into the public area here in 32 some therefore cried one thing some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were even come together so we've seen that right in our usa crowds of crazy people screaming and hollering throwing beer bottles and whatever not even knowing what they're what their cause is well the same thing they're just utter confusion you know so they um so we have a case here where paul he wanted to go in and help he thought man i can i can solve this i can help you all but his friends and companions stopped him now it's too dangerous no you can't do that what it was was a well well-calculated ruckus which only produced organized confusion but their attention was focused on brother alexander verse 34 when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians so there's a there's a riot and they got it going you know just like some things we've seen graves got it in for for you know for two hours and um so we got this religious riot and ephesus because of the way and what it produces what's to produce god fearing christians willing to take a stand for the truth no matter what the relatives thought or believed and those are our brothers and sisters and we are the present day fulfillment of hebrews 13 8. back in 1950 brother branham said behold the lamb of god get ready wake up lift up your heads redemption is drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing critics infidels waxing worse and worse it sounds like they didn't that was 1950 he says we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to god so the believer that is secure and fortified by the word of god knows that john 1 john 4 4 is right greater is he that's in me and all this stuff out here and jesus said in luke 21 28 when all this begins to happen you look up don't worry about that you can't solve it leave it alone we're leaving soon so jesus prayed for us over here in uh i know you probably didn't think of that but in john chapter 17 look over there real quick in john 17 verse 20 and i'll read it out of this other bible and you can see how sometimes it helps let's see john 17 and 20. give my number straight here um verse 20. i'm not making requests for these alone in other words these 11 disciples here but also for the sake of those who believe on in me through their word that's us that's right we weren't there we don't have films we don't have nothing we got their word and that's why we believe so that they all may be one just as thou my father art with me and i am one with thee they also may be one with us so the world may believe that thou didst send me okay so you were in the thoughts of jesus christ even before he got to the cross okay he loves you how much does he love you arm is wide open for god so loved the world he gives only begotten son okay so the resurrection is the cornerstone of our message amen see everybody's got a bible they're everywhere but you have to believe in the resurrected christ and his spirit coming into us so in our story here in verse chapter 19 the mayor of the town we got them all quieted down and he says you know people calm down we have laws we have legal ways of dealing with all this they're in verse 36 seeing that these things cannot be spoken against you ought to be quiet do nothing grassley for we have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess wherefore if demetrius and his men have a matter against any man the law is open we have deputies so forth but if you inquire anything concerning other matters it shall be determined by law for we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar all this nonsense you know there being no cause wherefore whereby we may be uh to give account of the concourse and when he had thus spoken you dismissed the assembly okay so you got a picture of what's going on there paul's journeys weren't pleasant they didn't know they didn't have five-star hotels and he's being you know accused of things he's trying to defend himself and then we're having a lot of problems so let's look at chapter 20 and then we will dismiss until tomorrow the lord tarries fair enough sun's still out dairy queen's still open so chapter 20 verse 1 and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go to macedonia okay so after the riot he had a meeting with the faithful they embraced they prayed went on to macedonia so the text goes on to mention several of his faithful traveling companions there's seven of them and of significance in verse six they sailed for five days to cover 200 miles now today you know we have these nice cars i mean if you really try you can go six maybe 800 miles a day so five days they sailed they didn't have no motors okay the wind was blowing right you could row and so forth and they were very patient people because they had no other choice now just for comparison you know today we have uh many choices for travel we've got all kinds of restaurants all kinds of stuff now down in brazil they have a big river it's called the amazon now where the amazon and the southern river come together the river is five miles wide it's a lot of water and so it's moving and so to get from there out to the coast it's 1200 miles and with a diesel powered barge it takes six days so even today there are places where they've got to have a lot of patience so anyway they're with the believers in troas for seven days that's in current day turkey that was a key roman seaport at the time and the working people gathered around the visitors to spend an evening together uh to hear more about the faith they were following the pattern established in the beginning coming together around the apostles teachings for fellowship for daily breaking of bread and in chapter 2 verses 42 and 46 we found whether they came together daily and brother brown says that when they came together daily they were partaking of communion because they were just following the instructions the lord said in luke 22 this do in remembrance of me so chapter 20 and verse 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart to depart on the morrow and he continued his speech until midnight now we're not going to stay at midnight but um he uh he was with his associates there and normally they would meet with this with the jews on the sabbath and the synagogues and these early missionaries took the gospel wherever whenever they found people gathered sometimes down at the river chapter 16 but here for the first time it's mentioned that the the christians broke bread on the first day of the week two important points the early church they were significantly warned against submitting themselves to the bondage of any legalistic observance of sabbath days it's in colossians 2 and galatians 4. these early churches voluntarily chose um the first day of the week as an appropriate time to fellowship and worship here in first corinthians 16 in remembrance of the day our lord arose that's of course in the four gospels but it was a new day a new people a new creation first corinthians 5. so the observance of the first day of the week is in many early writings even irenaeus messenger to the second church age so here's paul having communion service with the saints in troas he's leaving the next day and he's preaching to a very eager bunch of disciples and he had a lot to tell him i mean i don't know about brother paul but you've had people in here that they go over the time limits you know please turn the lights off when you leave but it was different back then so he had a lot to say and they were listening and he's still preaching at midnight look at verse 8 and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together and what i like about luke's writing he includes all the details we got many lights here but nobody's about to faint nobody's you know getting tired because of the heat off the lights but back then it was fire it was torches on the wall a lot of them it says so it's warm and they're sat in the window a certain young man named uh eutecus and he fell into a deep sleep and as paul was preaching you know past 12 o'clock he went just down with sleep and he fell out of the window in the third loft yeah the third story is out there and now he's dead now what are you going to do and paul went down fell upon him and embraced him and said trouble not yourselves life is in him and we therefore come up again he they broke bread eaten and talked a long while even until the break of day and then he departed so he's been up all day preached clear up past midnight and had communion okay the sun's coming up it's time to go so y'all got dc they didn't have air conditioning either um so yeah it was um interesting times back then so um now they're headed to jerusalem for the feast of pentecost that's 50 days after the resurrection okay acts chapter 2. and from the text they were hurrying and they stopped at militants sent a messenger up into town called the elders of the church in ephesus he came down to the port to see him verses 18 through 35 it was his farewell speech to the believers the church leaders and he felt compelled he must get to jerusalem even though the saints at every stop urged him not to go now let's look at the facts uh verse 25 of chapter 20 verse 25 and now behold i know that you all uh among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more oh they didn't want to hear that verse 27 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock and he's speaking to the church leaders here over which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood and we'll keep going for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock others come to tear things up also of your own selves many shall arise speaking perverse things and draw away disciples after them we've seen the first same thing yeah therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn everyone day and night with tears and now brethren i command you i commend you to the god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified i have coveted no man's silver gold so forth yay yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities in other words i made my own way and to them that were with me i have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of our lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down now they're down at they're at the they're in the sand there the boat's right there they came down from town so they're right there in the sand they kneeled down and prayed with them all and they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck kissed him sorry most of all for the words which he spake that they would see his face no more and they accompanied him into the ship so it's a sad situation but it's facts and i'm glad that we have luke that wrote all this down carefully and they were sad to see him go but he left them with the word they they had something to hold on to so that's where we're going to stop for tonight if the lord gives us breath we'll be back in the morning and we'll pick it up from there and be sure and come back so if our brother would like to come up and dismiss the service we'll start on chapter 21 tomorrow amen why don't we stand we'll just sing a couple songs and we'll be dismissed let's sing um god rich in mercy key of d 286
