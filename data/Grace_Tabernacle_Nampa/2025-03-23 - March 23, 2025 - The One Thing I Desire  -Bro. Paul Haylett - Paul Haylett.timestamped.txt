[7:57] you. Chiefest of sinners. Jesus will
[8:03] say all he has promised that will he
[8:09] do. Wash in the
[8:12] fountain open for
[8:14] sin and I will pass will pass over you.
[8:22] When

[8:29] I see the

[8:34] I see the
[8:37] blood, I will pass. I will pass over

[8:49] there.
[8:50] Each one
[8:52] receiving justly is
[8:55] due. Hide in the saving sin cleansing
[9:01] blood and I will pass will pass over

[10:24] words. Amen. Not just words to me. It's
[10:29] life. It's truth. Amen.
[10:33] Hallelujah. Um it's number number 651. I
[10:37] know whom I have believed.
[10:45] I know not why God's wonderous grace to
[10:51] me he hath made
[10:55] known nor why
[10:59] unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for
[11:05] his own.
[11:08] But I know whom I have believe in and am
[11:15] persuaded that he is
[11:18] aable to keep that which I've
[11:24] committed unto him against that day.
[11:30] I know not how this saving faith to
[11:37] me did
[11:41] impart nor how
[11:44] believing in his word brought peace
[11:49] within my heart.
[11:53] But I know whom I have
[11:57] believeth and am
[12:00] persuaded that he is
[12:03] able to keep that which I've
[12:09] committed unto him against that
[12:14] day. I know not how the spirit moved.
[12:22] Convincing men of
[12:26] sin,
[12:28] revealing Jesus through the word,
[12:33] cateing faith in him.
[12:38] But I know whom I have believe it and am
[12:45] persuaded that he is
[12:48] aable to keep that which I've
[12:54] committed unto him against that day.
[13:00] I know not what a good or may be
[13:08] reserved for
[13:11] me. Of worery ways or golden day before
[13:19] his face I see.
[13:23] But I know whom I have
[13:27] believed and am
[13:30] persuaded that he is
[13:33] able to keep that which I've
[13:38] committed unto him against that day.
[13:45] I know not when my Lord may come at
[13:51] night or noon day
[13:55] fair, nor if I'll walk the veil with him
[14:02] or meet him in the air.
[14:07] But I
[14:09] know I have believe it and am
[14:14] persuaded that he is
[14:17] able to keep that which I've
[14:23] committed unto him against that
[14:29] day.
[14:31] Amen. Amen.

[17:33] something." They said, "Just want to be
[17:34] able to hear my daddy say, "Well done.
[17:36] Good
[17:37] job." So, is that what you're looking
[17:38] for this morning? Amen.

[35:46] 1-6. And
[35:49] uh when I was you know studying this
[35:53] um you know you stop sometimes and say
[35:56] you know what is it what is it that I
[35:59] really long for the most in my life. Um
[36:04] you know some they would say as a rich
[36:07] young ruler obviously he desired his
[36:09] wealth more than to be in the words of
[36:13] following the leadership of the lord. uh
[36:16] we see different things that people
[36:17] express to desire uh certain things of
[36:21] life and uh I believe it comes to this
[36:24] place that we as Christians as believers
[36:27] the one thing that we desire more than
[36:30] anything else is to be in the presence
[36:33] and the will of God. Amen. That that is
[36:36] the most important thing. And as we see
[36:40] the word uh having told us what would
[36:43] happen in these latter days, right? This
[36:45] is not a mystery uh to us. The word very
[36:48] clear what we would see in this day. Yet
[36:52] this sounds a little direct but yet the
[36:56] world of
[36:57] Christendom is just as nervous as a
[37:01] secular
[37:02] world as though they didn't understand
[37:05] what the word of God already told us
[37:08] about today. But my brother and sister,
[37:11] I I think by God's grace that we can
[37:14] stand today with a confidence to know
[37:17] what today is and what tomorrow is
[37:19] because we know who holds today and
[37:22] tomorrow, our future. There's no need to
[37:25] be nervous. Amen. The word says that he
[37:27] didn't bring us this far to lose us.
[37:30] Amen. Or to let us fail. So, amen. The
[37:35] one thing I desire. Psalms 27 1-6. The
[37:38] Lord is my light and my salvation. And
[37:41] anytime you feel like saying amen, you
[37:43] can just go ahead and say
[37:45] amen. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[37:49] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[37:52] afraid? When the wicked, even mine
[37:54] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[37:57] up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[38:00] Though a host should encamp against me,
[38:03] my heart shall not fear. Though war
[38:06] should arise against me, in this will I
[38:08] be confident. One thing I have desired
[38:12] of the Lord, that I will seek after,
[38:16] that I may dwell in the house of the
[38:19] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[38:22] the beauty of the Lord, to inquire in
[38:25] his temple. For in the time of trouble
[38:28] he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the
[38:31] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[38:34] me. He shall set me upon a rock. And now
[38:38] shall my head be lifted up above mine
[38:40] enemies. Round about me. Therefore will
[38:42] I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[38:46] joy. I will sing. Yay. I will sing
[38:50] praises unto the Lord. Amen. Isn't that
[38:53] wonderful? I've always loved that
[38:56] scripture because it is there giving us
[38:58] a very clear picture of the condition we
[39:02] should be in. Amen. If we're not in that
[39:06] position, that condition, he's already
[39:09] promised that he will put us there.
[39:11] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Heavenly Father,
[39:14] we just ask you this morning, bless each
[39:16] and everyone, Lord, that's here. Lord,
[39:19] ask you to be with those who are not
[39:21] here today, their circumstance. Father,
[39:24] you know, a guiding hand upon each one
[39:27] of us. Father, may questions be
[39:30] answered. May our hearts be encouraged.
[39:32] May doubts and fears flee in the
[39:36] presence of your word. Lord, we thank
[39:38] you for your kindness and your goodness
[39:40] to us. And Lord, we long, Father, to
[39:43] just come to the place that our first
[39:45] thought, our first reaction, our first
[39:48] action is to always trust you. Amen.
[39:51] Lord, we thank you for this opportunity
[39:53] today, this privilege to come in the
[39:55] house of God, Lord, to worship you, sing
[39:59] praises, listen to your word, and
[40:02] receive your word. We ask this now in
[40:04] your precious name. Amen. You may be
[40:07] seated, saints.
[40:10] As we look through this scripture, we
[40:13] know that there was a time, a season
[40:15] that
[40:17] David must have had every doubt and fear
[40:20] that that we do. He must have wondered
[40:23] um how could I've got so far out of the
[40:26] will of God. How how could u conditions
[40:29] of everything be in such a place? But
[40:32] yet the Lord comes so faithful to David
[40:35] reminding him and stirring up his heart
[40:38] for you know he's the one who created
[40:41] that heart as we sang the song. I sure
[40:43] appreciated that. Amen. And so it's
[40:46] there that him knowing our hearts
[40:48] intimately he knows exactly how to
[40:51] encourage and bring his word to us that
[40:54] would cause us to come into that correct
[40:56] position. Amen. You know, I I remember
[40:59] one time hearing a man say, "You know,
[41:02] the times and the seasons, the reason
[41:04] your s dial doesn't work is because
[41:06] you've kept it in the dark." And so, we
[41:09] have to have it out in the light for it
[41:11] to speak to us or to to bring about the
[41:14] answer. Now, in the uh message uh let
[41:18] your shine light shine so shine before
[41:21] men. I'll get that out. Um, want to just
[41:25] read these words right here because I
[41:27] think that uh uh these are good. Uh,
[41:30] this is really sets the pace or the tone
[41:32] of what I'd like to speak this morning.
[41:35] And it says, "Now, for just these few
[41:36] minutes, I just want don't want to get
[41:38] up here to just be seen or to be heard.
[41:42] That wouldn't be right. But maybe God
[41:44] helping me, maybe we could speak some
[41:46] words to something that'll edify to us,
[41:49] that'll help us all how that we would do
[41:52] better and live a better life. I'm sure
[41:55] that's what we all are here for is to
[41:58] take correction and get an understanding
[42:01] of what we can do to make us better
[42:04] Christian. If you have one thing, if I
[42:07] have one thing in my life that I desire
[42:10] is to be a better Christian than I am,
[42:13] can we say amen to that? And I'm sure
[42:16] that that's the heart's cry of every
[42:18] soul that's here tonight is to be a
[42:21] better Christian. And as we'll look at
[42:23] this, my brother and sister, this is not
[42:25] just an aspect of uh I I attended more
[42:29] faithful, I I gave more, I did all these
[42:32] things, but literally it is the
[42:35] expression of Christ in us. Amen. It
[42:38] changing us that our flesh is no longer
[42:41] in control, but the Holy Spirit then is
[42:44] guiding us. A better Christian to be
[42:46] Christlike. My brother and sister, you
[42:49] can look, we can defend behaviors if we
[42:51] want to. There was a time that Jesus
[42:53] braided a cord. Some people would say,
[42:55] "Well, I have a right to be angry."
[42:57] Well, my brother and sister, the very
[42:59] nature of the word that comes and the
[43:02] ministry of this hour was that love is
[43:04] the capstone. Amen. Without love at the
[43:07] capstone, we can justify a lot of
[43:09] things. But when we have Christ's love,
[43:12] that we as sinners and he loved us.
[43:16] Amen. My that should never be far from
[43:19] our memory. That should never be far
[43:21] from our thoughts. And as we look at
[43:23] this, we'll realize that here we are
[43:26] today. Sometimes uh church service, uh
[43:30] God deals in correction to us. And
[43:32] sometimes he's just giving us a better
[43:35] view of himself, revelation, opening the
[43:38] word to us that we can see. And you
[43:40] know, if we are here for any other
[43:42] purpose than to be corrected and to be
[43:45] encouraged, we need to stop really and
[43:48] and study what is our objective. If we
[43:51] come in the house of God just to learn
[43:53] more, my brother and sister, our our
[43:55] learning, our education might not do us
[43:58] one bit of good if it's not applied
[44:00] correctly. But if we come in the right
[44:03] spirit, the right attitude, we come with
[44:05] the right desire today, then the Lord
[44:08] will magnify those traits or that seed
[44:11] that he's already placed in your life,
[44:13] he will magnify that. And we can leave
[44:16] as it has been said many many times, uh
[44:19] we will either leave a better or worse
[44:22] person because there's no such thing as
[44:24] just staying the same. We we have to
[44:27] come closer to him or we will grow
[44:29] distant to him. I believe that we're
[44:32] here today. The desire that we have and
[44:34] I believe we can express is the fact
[44:37] that we want to come closer to our Lord
[44:40] Jesus every single day of our life. And
[44:43] certainly it's Satan's goal to put the
[44:46] wedge or to keep you from coming closer.
[44:49] And he will use all kinds of things. And
[44:51] the scripture says if our hearts condemn
[44:53] us not and that's Satan's business right
[44:56] there is just to be one a dispenser of
[44:59] condemnation. He's coming to just
[45:01] continually leave things there in our
[45:03] life that are worrisome. They're
[45:05] bothersome. They are a a a pull on our
[45:08] energy, spiritual energy, if you'd put
[45:10] it that way. Always drawing on that,
[45:13] trying to keep it down uh to where we
[45:16] never really have confidence because the
[45:18] word says that you ask anything in my
[45:21] name. Well, if you don't have confidence
[45:25] to ask,
[45:27] Amen. Then there's a lot of promises
[45:30] that you will miss.
[45:32] Things that you'll never take complete
[45:35] control
[45:36] of, never
[45:39] overcome if your heart's always
[45:41] condemning you. That's right. So you
[45:44] see, Satan doesn't have to cause us. You
[45:46] say, "Well, brother Paul, what will it
[45:48] be that maybe we would be condemned
[45:51] over?"
[45:53] Well, I've known people that
[45:56] lived lives before they were saved that
[46:00] were just I don't know the right word. I
[46:03] want to use the right
[46:05] word. Very far out there. They were just
[46:09] almost everything that you can think of.
[46:12] They don't even like to give their
[46:14] testimony because it it just goes out
[46:16] there so far. and they've got saved,
[46:19] been washed in the blood of Jesus
[46:21] Christ, been living a godly life. And as
[46:23] the song that we sing, submidnight hour,
[46:26] if you should find, you're in a prison
[46:30] in your
[46:31] mind. And then Satan draws these things
[46:35] out. Now, remember, as far as God's
[46:37] concerned, it's under the blood and it
[46:39] doesn't exist. But Satan, he got a
[46:41] glimpse of what it was. And so he gets
[46:43] to reach in there and pull these things
[46:45] out and dangle that before the people.
[46:48] And if they don't have uh the ability, I
[46:51] I I don't know that that's the right
[46:53] word, but if they don't have that to to
[46:55] just say simply, Satan, I put it under
[46:58] the blood. If there's any doubt that
[47:00] they've been forgiven, Satan draws that
[47:02] out as condemnation. And they get up in
[47:05] the morning and they're tired and
[47:07] they're worried and they're stressed out
[47:09] and and they wonder. They come to the
[47:11] house of God and they can't quite find
[47:13] liberty and worship because these things
[47:15] are still lingering in the back of their
[47:17] mind and Satan just keeps anointing
[47:19] that. But my brother and sister, there
[47:21] comes to a place that we have to stand
[47:24] up and say the one thing that I desire
[47:27] more than any is to dwell in the house
[47:29] of the Lord forever. And I am dwelling
[47:31] there and I am going in there under the
[47:34] blood and then you come victory. You can
[47:37] walk and those things. Yes. That was the
[47:40] old me. But the old me does not even
[47:44] exist any longer. Can someone say amen
[47:47] to that? Amen. The old me is gone. I am
[47:51] a new creature in Christ Jesus. And the
[47:54] thing that I desire is to serve God
[47:56] faithfully each and every day. There is
[47:59] actually no beginning of your Christian
[48:01] experience. You realize as a son or
[48:04] daughter of God, you were in him before
[48:06] the foundation of the world. So that is
[48:09] a period of time that you being in that
[48:12] form come and Satan had his opportunity.
[48:16] But God said there's a season of the
[48:18] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[48:21] God that I'm going to bring them out.
[48:23] And we say, "Oh, this is when I got
[48:25] saved." Well, my brother and sister, you
[48:27] look at the word carefully. You were
[48:29] saved from before the foundation of the
[48:31] world. This is an earthly expression of
[48:34] Christ's salvation, the blood of Jesus
[48:37] Christ in your life. And so you look at
[48:39] that and realize, you know what? I
[48:41] always was a son of God, daughter of
[48:43] God. I always will be a son or daughter
[48:46] of God. There's no beginning and there's
[48:48] no ending because you were either always
[48:52] an eternal creature or you never was an
[48:56] eternal creature. There's no such thing
[48:58] as I came and became an eternal creature
[49:01] in Christ Jesus by coming to an altar or
[49:04] saying the sinner's prayer. But to
[49:06] realize you were in the mind of Christ
[49:09] from the very beginning.
[49:11] And I tell you, God knows what he's
[49:13] doing. Amen. When you take, you know,
[49:17] testimony, when you see beyond the
[49:18] curtain of time, you know, and here's
[49:21] this beautiful young lady. She's coming
[49:23] up there and, you know, Brother Brown
[49:25] don't know who she is. He he doesn't
[49:27] recognize Holy Spirit speak to him and
[49:29] says, "You led her to the Lord in her
[49:32] 90s." Now, you would think God would if
[49:35] she was going to be saved, why didn't
[49:37] God save her all the way back here at 20
[49:40] years old because he's got a plan and
[49:43] his plan is coming to pass. Was that a
[49:45] mistake? No, my brother and sister. It
[49:48] goes to show that no habit, no nature,
[49:50] no nothing can stop you if you're a son
[49:52] or daughter of God from being saved. And
[49:55] so in that we stand here on the word. No
[49:58] other position, not my feeling, not my
[50:00] emotion, not my education, but we stand
[50:02] on the word because the word is
[50:04] infallible.
[50:06] Men will make mistakes. Men will come
[50:08] short, but God's word is
[50:11] infallible. Amen. So we look at that. I
[50:14] say, I want to be a better Christian
[50:17] this morning. I'm not going to come and
[50:19] rest on laurels and say, well, praise
[50:21] God, I got saved at this point. I've
[50:23] been serving God. I've been doing all of
[50:25] this, but today I will express from my
[50:28] heart, from my mouth, Lord, I desire to
[50:31] be a better Christian. Amen. Many people
[50:34] desire a sign. We see in the in churches
[50:37] today, everything is about a sign. There
[50:39] has to be some indication, some
[50:41] vindication. There has to be something
[50:44] that would would prove to them. But my
[50:46] brother and sister, remember, if God
[50:48] said it, it will come to pass. Amen. Do
[50:52] you need a sign on what God has already
[50:55] confirmed? Amen. We don't have to have
[50:58] some sign here and there. You know, we
[51:01] can get all carried away with th these
[51:04] things. You know, I I was driving along
[51:07] and I saw this and I saw that and you
[51:10] know, that's wonderful, my brother and
[51:11] sister, but just because the light shone
[51:14] through the windshield of your car and
[51:16] turn that little cross hanging from your
[51:18] your rearview mirror into multicolors,
[51:21] uh, you know, that doesn't mean that you
[51:23] are saved. That doesn't mean you have
[51:25] the Holy Ghost. That doesn't mean much
[51:27] of anything. And yet God could use
[51:30] something if you've been praying or
[51:32] desiring in the right need or the right
[51:34] circumstance and it could speak to your
[51:37] heart. So we're not doing away with
[51:39] that. But you see if the Lord said it,
[51:42] that's really the sign that we want
[51:43] today. Amen. To find ourselves in the
[51:46] word of God. God said it and I believe
[51:48] it. And the sign is that I am here as a
[51:51] son or daughter of God believing the
[51:54] word. There's the sign that we need in
[51:56] this day cuz many signs can be
[51:59] impersonated. Many things can come and
[52:01] and represented. But my brother and
[52:03] sister, the word living in you is God's
[52:07] representation on the earth today. Amen.
[52:10] He doesn't need a sign here and a sign
[52:12] there. What he wants is the sign to be
[52:14] in our soul today guiding us. Amen. So
[52:18] if they promised a sign, there'll be a
[52:21] sign. That's one thing that we know. If
[52:24] he said there'll be a sign, there will
[52:26] be a sign. Amen. But you know, the world
[52:30] we live in, Satan's figured out. If I
[52:32] can just distract the people, they won't
[52:34] even notice what I'm doing. They won't
[52:37] even see what I'm doing. And so, we have
[52:40] a lot of lot of distraction in this age.
[52:44] I mean, there's you can name it. There's
[52:46] so there's so many. We could spend the
[52:48] rest of this time this morning naming
[52:51] the distraction. So, if we're not paying
[52:53] attention, we might miss a sign that's
[52:56] right before us. God speaking, dealing
[52:58] with us right right in front of us.
[53:02] Amen. So, you know what? You're going to
[53:05] look for a sign. Look for God's revealed
[53:07] word in your life. You'll find there's a
[53:09] sign of him, the Holy Spirit moving in
[53:11] your life each and every day. The
[53:14] prophet of God says that whenever the
[53:16] Holy Spirit lays something on your
[53:18] heart, act on it. Amen. Don't put it off
[53:20] for another day. act on it right now.
[53:24] Amen. And you'll realize that there's
[53:25] more signs in your life than you
[53:28] realize. God doing more in your life
[53:30] than you realize. Let's not be a
[53:33] distracted people. Amen. Now, here in
[53:38] this the word become
[53:41] flesh. Now, Christianity has been
[53:43] represented to you in the form of
[53:47] doctrine. We can say amen to that. Here
[53:50] it is. You're a Christian. You believe
[53:51] this in pamphlets and in Bible, which I
[53:55] am for it 100%. God help those
[53:58] missionaries that go there to live
[53:59] there. Yes, sir. But I said it's not
[54:02] fully been represented to you. See, it's
[54:04] been represented to you in word only.
[54:08] That's right. I want you to stop and
[54:11] think about that. You can take a
[54:14] Bible and you can give this Bible to
[54:17] someone and say, "This is the word of
[54:19] God." But without revelation, they can
[54:23] read every word inside these covers and
[54:27] it not change their life one bit. That's
[54:29] right. Most read book on earth they
[54:34] claim. And
[54:36] yet does it have the most reaction
[54:39] amongst the people by
[54:41] populist? No, sir. There's books that I
[54:44] won't dare to even mention that are
[54:47] coming close to outselling the Bible.
[54:50] And there are books that talk about
[54:51] nothing but sin and debauchery. That's
[54:54] right.
[54:56] So, it's not just a
[54:57] matter. It's not just a matter that you
[55:01] have a Bible. It's not been fully
[55:03] represented to you. See, it's been
[55:05] represented to you in word only. But the
[55:07] God that wrote that word that you
[55:09] already got placed in your heart has now
[55:12] come to a place till he's going to make
[55:14] the word live. See, make himself in the
[55:19] word. That's right. Is that fully
[55:22] understandable? Amen. He's taking this
[55:25] and it's not no longer just a book
[55:27] sitting on a shelf in our house. We
[55:29] might respect it, keep the dust off of
[55:31] it, even read it, do all of these
[55:34] things, but my brother and sister, it
[55:36] can just be words. But when he himself
[55:39] comes and makes this living in you and
[55:42] I, it is lifechanging. We don't have to
[55:45] say, "Oh, it's so hard to serve God."
[55:49] No, you got to get to the point. He's
[55:52] living in the word in you. Amen. And
[55:55] when he's living in the word in you, it
[55:58] suddenly takes it and casts every care
[56:01] on him. Amen. It puts it on him where we
[56:05] don't have to bear the burden. We don't
[56:07] have to try to overcome. We don't have
[56:09] to do these things. Yes, we have things
[56:11] in our lives that that were little
[56:13] habits, you might say, that you need to
[56:15] overcome. I saw this little thing. It it
[56:18] really actually kind of chastised me a
[56:20] little bit. I have a bad habit just it
[56:22] stuck with me for years and it seems
[56:24] like I overcome it and then it comes
[56:26] back and you know and it's here it is
[56:29] the dad who tells his little boy now son
[56:32] I don't want you to ever use the word
[56:34] stupid in
[56:37] public and then it flips over and a car
[56:39] cuts the man off and he says that's
[56:41] stupid
[56:43] driver you see how easy Sister Jerry's
[56:47] grinning because it's a word I have to
[56:49] keep just just crimping down on not
[56:53] using that
[56:57] word. But you see, God
[57:01] knows. And you think he's just going to
[57:03] say, "It's okay if you do that,
[57:06] Paul." No. He's going to
[57:09] continue to
[57:11] correct, to encourage, to strengthen, to
[57:16] manifest because he cares.
[57:19] There's not a portion of our life we
[57:21] don't get a uh uh you know pass uh uh go
[57:26] collect the 200. We don't we don't get
[57:28] uh you know that however that old
[57:30] monopoly phrase was. We don't we don't
[57:33] get one of those. We don't get a dozen
[57:34] of those. We don't get a thousand of
[57:36] those. God said he was going to bring
[57:37] you and I into perfection. And God's
[57:40] idea of perfection is not just close.
[57:44] It's right on the point. It's right
[57:45] there. And I say this. You say, "Brother
[57:48] Paul, okay, that's good. That's
[57:49] wonderful." No, I'm expressing to you
[57:51] and trying to break using everybody else
[57:53] for an example. I'm expressing to you
[57:55] that God cares and I desire to be what
[57:59] God cares about. Amen. Because it's only
[58:03] the word of God in you that can bring
[58:05] you to the place that the word is more
[58:07] important than anything else in your
[58:09] life. And when we come to that point, as
[58:12] we're growing into that, we'll find that
[58:15] we are here and the word starts to live.
[58:18] People say, "We're not really seeing
[58:19] anything supernatural taking place.
[58:21] We're not seeing, you know, young people
[58:23] of this day that are overcoming. We
[58:26] don't see this. We don't see that." My
[58:28] brother and sister, I'm sorry. I see it.
[58:30] Even if it would be our young people
[58:32] just one little step at a time coming
[58:34] closer to the Lord, it's supernatural in
[58:37] my eyes. It's supernatural to see us
[58:40] break a barrier uh something that
[58:42] hindered our life and it might have been
[58:44] there 20 30 40 years and suddenly we
[58:47] realize God has delivered us from that.
[58:50] My brother and sister that is
[58:51] supernatural because Satan just needs
[58:54] one little thing. If taking and adding
[58:57] or subtracting one word breaks the word
[58:59] of God then Satan doesn't need to have a
[59:02] thousand to keep you out of the word. He
[59:06] just needs one.
[59:09] And we have to come to the place that
[59:11] our
[59:12] desire is to be his
[59:15] desire to live the word that it would
[59:19] come forth from us. Not
[59:22] forced. Not
[59:24] forced. We were joking about this the
[59:26] other day.
[59:28] You
[59:30] know, you get on an
[59:35] airplane, you have to scan everyone on
[59:38] the airplane
[59:39] before you watch the
[59:43] movie cuz you don't want someone coming
[59:47] up and patting on the shoulder, good to
[59:49] see you, brother.
[59:54] Oh, some of you relate.
[59:59] Nothing like having your
[1:00:01] children say, "Oh, it's no problem. We
[1:00:04] have
[1:00:06] Netflix." The parents are over there
[1:00:08] like our
[1:00:10] children. Spend more time teaching your
[1:00:13] kids not to say you have Netflix than
[1:00:15] you do teaching them the word of God.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:19] You see, that's a forced Christianity.
[1:00:22] That's a forced reaction to the word.
[1:00:27] But I tell you what God's doing. God's
[1:00:29] putting a desire in a people that says
[1:00:31] that's nothing more than Satan's
[1:00:33] distraction. That's right. Oh, I don't
[1:00:35] think there's probably any one of us
[1:00:37] here today that's exempt from these kind
[1:00:39] of distractions. And I wouldn't say that
[1:00:41] all of them are are what you would say
[1:00:43] evil. But I'm telling you, let's not
[1:00:46] focus on the good or the evil. Let's
[1:00:47] just focus on whether it's a distraction
[1:00:49] or not. And Satan wants to offer up the
[1:00:52] distraction. I'll let God deal with you
[1:00:54] whether you should have Netflix or not.
[1:00:57] Amen. So, you know, it's there that you
[1:00:59] take that position. Is it drawing you
[1:01:02] closer to the Lord or is it drawing you
[1:01:05] away? And remember, every heartbeat you
[1:01:07] have is one heartbeat closer to your
[1:01:10] last one. That's right. And Satan just
[1:01:12] wants to get us to the point that our
[1:01:14] spiritual heartbeat is getting closer to
[1:01:16] the last one.
[1:01:19] Is everybody okay with that? Yes.
[1:01:22] Amen. You see, a living word when it's
[1:01:25] made known to you and I. Now, I believe
[1:01:28] every one of us sitting here would say,
[1:01:29] you know what, there's been times God
[1:01:31] has absolutely revealed himself to me,
[1:01:34] absolutely spoke through the scripture
[1:01:36] to me. Absolutely opened my eyes to see.
[1:01:39] So, we would say the word has been made
[1:01:41] living in our presence. And so when it's
[1:01:44] made known in our hearts, in our lives,
[1:01:46] you know, to make the word live, he had
[1:01:50] to come down and live in the revealed
[1:01:52] word. Yes. Now, it sounds like just a
[1:01:55] little word phrase, but it it's as I
[1:01:57] said earlier, it's actually deeper than
[1:01:59] we give it credit for because you can
[1:02:01] read your Bible. It mean nothing. Not
[1:02:03] change your life at all. Amen. In fact,
[1:02:06] I just read a little article. a a
[1:02:08] certain group of churches has decided
[1:02:11] that the Ten Commandments are not even
[1:02:13] relevant in their religion any
[1:02:17] longer. If you throw the Ten
[1:02:19] Commandments out, you might as well
[1:02:21] throw the Bible
[1:02:23] out. So, it won't be long before the
[1:02:27] churches will be saying the Bible's not
[1:02:30] relevant to
[1:02:32] us. In fact, there's some that are
[1:02:34] already borderline to that.
[1:02:37] So when the Bible's no longer important,
[1:02:39] it won't matter that the God of the word
[1:02:41] is in his word because they won't have
[1:02:44] his word in their homes, in their
[1:02:47] churches, in their lives. And so you
[1:02:49] realize just how clever Satan is. Amen.
[1:02:52] So to have a living word, Christ had to
[1:02:55] come down into the word and make it
[1:02:57] live. So he's living in the revealed
[1:03:00] word. In other words, you can't have a
[1:03:02] revelation of the word of God without
[1:03:05] having God himself, Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:03:09] So, it becomes a word jumble. We're not
[1:03:12] interested in word jumbles. We're
[1:03:14] interested in lifechanging word of God
[1:03:16] in our life. Amen. So, it's there, you
[1:03:20] know, it's
[1:03:22] interesting. Now, this was shared to me
[1:03:25] some time back. brother were making a
[1:03:28] point to me and he said, "Brother Paul,
[1:03:30] you need to look at the church as a
[1:03:33] living
[1:03:33] entity. It breathes in and people come
[1:03:36] into the church. It breathes out, people
[1:03:40] leave the church. Maybe not to go to the
[1:03:43] world, maybe their job, family reasons,
[1:03:46] they move away and then the church
[1:03:48] breathes in again and people come into
[1:03:50] the church. It's a living organism,
[1:03:53] living, breathing in and out." My
[1:03:56] brother and sister, the word of God,
[1:03:58] revelation, God breathing into you a
[1:04:01] closer understanding, a a deeper
[1:04:03] understanding of who you are. And
[1:04:06] sometimes when he's breathing out, we
[1:04:08] find ourselves wondering, Lord, I don't
[1:04:11] understand. There's things happening in
[1:04:13] my life. I don't see it. My children
[1:04:15] aren't all that enthused to be in the
[1:04:17] house of God. They're not enthused to be
[1:04:19] hearing the preaching of the word. In
[1:04:20] fact, I'll admit it. I'm not enthused.
[1:04:24] Oh Lord, why? But then he breathes back
[1:04:27] and my brother and sister we find
[1:04:29] ourselves in a desperation digging into
[1:04:32] the word and we say thank you Lord that
[1:04:34] you've come on this scene again. This is
[1:04:36] human nature. The hot and cold, the
[1:04:38] high, the low, the mountain top, the
[1:04:40] valley. You can go through a lot of
[1:04:42] analogy. But my brother and sister, it's
[1:04:44] the word in you that is the living
[1:04:48] entity. Amen. It's not like I was on
[1:04:51] fire. I was not. If we're in the word,
[1:04:54] the living entity should be in us. It
[1:04:57] shouldn't just be quotations. That's
[1:04:59] right.
[1:05:01] It should be living, breathing. Amen.
[1:05:03] And we can type that to Christ in you.
[1:05:06] Amen. Amen. You can't have a
[1:05:08] relationship with Jesus Christ and be
[1:05:11] cold, lukewarm. Amen. Formal. You can't.
[1:05:15] Don't fool yourself.
[1:05:18] Let's not fool ourselves. If we have
[1:05:20] Christ in us, my brother and sister, we
[1:05:23] are a living entity and the gospel is
[1:05:25] changing our life. It It's rejuvenating.
[1:05:28] It's drawing us closer. You say, "But we
[1:05:30] have battles, brother Paul, that we
[1:05:32] can't seem to overcome." I'll tell you
[1:05:34] something. Tell Oh, thank God.
[1:05:38] Absolutely. Thank the Lord you have
[1:05:40] battles in your life because if you was
[1:05:42] not a son or daughter of God, then the
[1:05:45] devil wouldn't even need to conquer you
[1:05:48] because he would recognize you aren't
[1:05:50] even in the word of God. You're nothing.
[1:05:53] But my brother and sister, the greater
[1:05:54] the battle that you are facing, it shows
[1:05:57] just like Job that God knows in the end
[1:06:00] you will overcome that. In the end that
[1:06:02] you will rise in victory above that as
[1:06:05] an eagle comes. You'll catch a current
[1:06:07] one day and lift right up of the cares
[1:06:10] of this life. And God had enough
[1:06:12] confidence in you to let you be
[1:06:14] subjected to that battle. If he didn't
[1:06:17] have confidence in you, he would not
[1:06:20] have you in that position. So, we ought
[1:06:22] to stop right now. I don't know what
[1:06:24] you're facing today, but we maybe ought
[1:06:26] to lift a hand and say, "Thank you,
[1:06:28] Lord, that you love me and care for me
[1:06:30] just like you loved and cared for Job."
[1:06:33] Because in the end, Job was not the
[1:06:35] victor. It was God in Job that was the
[1:06:39] victor.
[1:06:42] Cuz we see Job righteous, righteous
[1:06:45] right up to the point that his very
[1:06:47] behavior was starting to become
[1:06:49] unrighteous,
[1:06:51] impatient, jealous,
[1:06:54] vindictive. And God said, "Okay, Job,
[1:06:57] I'm going to burn that out of you." that
[1:07:00] one day Job wakes up and says, "Oh my,
[1:07:03] oh my, these are my words. What have I
[1:07:06] been doing? What have I been saying?
[1:07:08] What an attitude I have. God forgive
[1:07:10] me." Yeah. Yep. Amen. And in that point
[1:07:12] right there, God bless Job to a position
[1:07:15] Job would have never reached on his own.
[1:07:19] That's right. And we sit here today, we
[1:07:21] have troubles in our lives, in our
[1:07:23] families, with our children, in our
[1:07:24] finances, all these aspects of this. And
[1:07:27] we ought to stop and say, "Thank you,
[1:07:29] Lord, that you would have enough
[1:07:31] confidence in me that you would allow me
[1:07:34] to be tested and tried and run through
[1:07:36] the fire because you see something in me
[1:07:40] I don't even see in me. And you will
[1:07:43] bring me, as the scripture says, to an
[1:07:46] expected end." Amen. God's expected end
[1:07:49] is not casting us into outer darkness.
[1:07:51] Amen. Our expected end is to hear the
[1:07:54] words, "Well done, my good and faithful
[1:07:57] servant." Amen. We can read the church
[1:08:00] ages. We can read the seals and all of
[1:08:02] this is good. But how much more
[1:08:04] glorious, my brother and sister, when
[1:08:06] that word is living and breathing in
[1:08:09] you. That's why that's got to be when
[1:08:12] you have come to the place that you know
[1:08:15] you are the word and I sit here today. I
[1:08:18] desire that in every day of my life,
[1:08:21] every aspect of my life, every
[1:08:23] circumstance of my life, I want to be
[1:08:25] able to say, Lord, this flesh might have
[1:08:28] just failed you, but I know my redeemer
[1:08:31] liveth. I know I'm victorious. I know
[1:08:34] I'm an overcomer in Christ Jesus.
[1:08:37] You see, that's when the word starts to
[1:08:40] breathe. Amen. Is when no matter what
[1:08:43] battle you have faced and circumstance
[1:08:45] you have faced, when you know Christ is
[1:08:48] in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:50] Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] You know, a brother one time asked a
[1:08:54] group of people he was speaking to. It
[1:08:57] was a I think a Saturday evening or
[1:08:59] something. They had a whiteboard or
[1:09:01] screen or something and he asked him, "I
[1:09:04] I want to know.
[1:09:06] I want to know in this informal
[1:09:09] environment how you know you have the
[1:09:12] Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost. And the people were quite
[1:09:16] interactive and they
[1:09:17] start writing these
[1:09:26] things. And he says, "Is it okay? Can I
[1:09:28] have permission to debunk every one of
[1:09:30] your
[1:09:32] statements?
[1:09:36] Imagine somebody just told you, "I'm
[1:09:38] going to debunk your very reason you
[1:09:40] believe you have the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost." Makes me
[1:09:47] nervous, man. Maybe what I offered up
[1:09:51] was too carnal sounding, too
[1:09:55] shallow. But the point he was making, he
[1:09:57] had saved a little margin on the bottom.
[1:10:03] And he says, "Now, I'm going to write
[1:10:05] something here that's going to be too
[1:10:07] simple for most of you to
[1:10:11] accept
[1:10:13] because the word says so."
[1:10:24] It has as much validity as I spoke in
[1:10:27] tongues. Much validity as I was a drunk
[1:10:30] and now I'm no longer. It has as much
[1:10:32] validity as anything. But he says the
[1:10:34] foundation of it is the word. Amen. The
[1:10:38] foundation of it is is not how I felt,
[1:10:40] what I thought, what I saw, all of these
[1:10:43] things. The foundation is the word says.
[1:10:46] So, amen.
[1:10:50] That's our desire is the word of God.
[1:10:52] Yeah,
[1:10:54] if you follow the headlines at all in
[1:10:56] the religious world, and I won't go into
[1:10:57] them, my brother and sister, but we find
[1:11:00] men that had religious
[1:11:02] reputations that were so
[1:11:05] incredible, huge
[1:11:10] followings. And they're falling. Yeah.
[1:11:13] Amen. Not just one or two, they're
[1:11:16] falling by the dozens. Amen. All around
[1:11:19] the world. Amen. Falling. Falling.
[1:11:21] falling. You know the only thing that
[1:11:23] will keep you and I from falling
[1:11:26] the word.
[1:11:28] Everything else can fall, but God's word
[1:11:33] cannot fall. It cannot fail. And there's
[1:11:36] the point that we say that we want to be
[1:11:39] at, we desire to be at. This is where I
[1:11:41] want to be. I want to be the word
[1:11:43] living. Not a dead word, not a word that
[1:11:46] we just quote and walk away, but a word
[1:11:48] that is vibrant inside of us. We can
[1:11:51] feel the pulsation of the word of God in
[1:11:53] our lives. We would say that's the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost. That's the very life of Christ is
[1:11:58] in us. But it had to come out of the
[1:12:01] written page into a living word that was
[1:12:05] deposited in you and I. And it's
[1:12:07] lifechanging.
[1:12:09] Amen. When a man ever once meets Christ
[1:12:12] on that ground, he will never be able to
[1:12:15] walk away. That's right. Because that's
[1:12:17] who he has become. Right. and has become
[1:12:21] him. Amen.
[1:12:23] Amen.
[1:12:29] Now, sorry, get excited. I'm losing my
[1:12:32] thought
[1:12:35] here. Chapter one, the revelation of
[1:12:38] Jesus Christ. Now, don't let anyone be
[1:12:40] misled by what I have said and think
[1:12:43] that I do not believe in the accuracy of
[1:12:46] the word as we now have it. I believe
[1:12:48] this Bible is accurate. Jesus completely
[1:12:51] authenticated the Old Testament when
[1:12:53] here on earth and it was compiled
[1:12:55] exactly as was our New Testament. Make
[1:12:58] no mistake about it. We have the
[1:13:00] infallible word of God today. No man
[1:13:03] dares to take from it or add to it. But
[1:13:06] we need the same spirit that gave it to
[1:13:11] teach us. Amen. Because if we approach
[1:13:15] this as a theologian, it won't work. I
[1:13:18] will hide it from the wise and the
[1:13:20] prudent. Amen. So, an intellectual, it
[1:13:23] won't work. You're falling into the wise
[1:13:25] and prudent. Amen. But he says in the
[1:13:28] word that I'm going to reveal it unto
[1:13:31] babes.
[1:13:32] Now, that's not talking about a a little
[1:13:35] two-year-old suddenly going to have a
[1:13:36] great revelation. He's talking about
[1:13:38] people who are babes in the word. They
[1:13:40] didn't come with an idea. They didn't
[1:13:42] come with a a a theological
[1:13:44] understanding, an explanation of it. But
[1:13:48] God come down, revealed himself, and
[1:13:51] desired to reveal himself to them. And
[1:13:55] they desired for it to be revealed to
[1:13:58] them. You see, you got to want to learn.
[1:14:03] I say this jokingly, and I certainly
[1:14:04] hope no kids take this serious, but I
[1:14:07] only passed English in high school
[1:14:09] because a teacher was tired of dealing
[1:14:10] with me.
[1:14:13] God doesn't have the same
[1:14:15] program. We're not going to make the
[1:14:17] rapture because God was just simply
[1:14:19] tired of dealing with us and wanted to
[1:14:22] just move us along. Now, you know, it
[1:14:26] probably is obvious if you listen to my
[1:14:28] English that I didn't do well in
[1:14:31] English. As a brother jokingly in South
[1:14:34] America said to me one time, "Brother
[1:14:36] Paul, is English your second language?
[1:14:41] It may as well
[1:14:43] be. But I tell you
[1:14:45] what, I know what words can
[1:14:48] do. Words can heal or they can wound.
[1:14:52] That's right. They can lift up or they
[1:14:55] can push down. They can draw to or push
[1:14:59] away. Exactly right. We know what words
[1:15:01] can do. You guys are smart. Amen. You
[1:15:04] know what words can do. Now, when you
[1:15:06] think about natural words, right? You
[1:15:08] can crush someone by your words. That's
[1:15:11] right. Amen.
[1:15:13] And the word of God word y
[1:15:18] words says come here. Come up a little
[1:15:21] higher. Amen.
[1:15:24] Come into my presence. That's right.
[1:15:27] Listen with your heart. That's right.
[1:15:29] Not your ears. That's it. Take the word.
[1:15:34] You wonder. Why don't you try it? Yeah,
[1:15:38] we were with brother Persant, sister
[1:15:40] Aona down in in California here recently
[1:15:42] and they took us down to the warf and
[1:15:46] you know I I thought this this man I
[1:15:50] don't know if he was the owner or just
[1:15:51] worked there or something but he was a
[1:15:53] good salesman. Sister Conc looking at
[1:15:56] some chocolates there and and he's just
[1:15:58] like here have one try
[1:16:01] it. Well, I'll tell you what. He had won
[1:16:04] all of us over with just one
[1:16:06] bite in the natural. Sure. Amen. You
[1:16:10] want to see the goodness of God? Try it.
[1:16:12] Amen. If you come, come and see. That's
[1:16:15] right. Thank you, brother David. I
[1:16:17] couldn't quite get that to click in my
[1:16:18] head. Come and see. That's right. Amen.
[1:16:22] Because if you ever come into his
[1:16:23] presence of the living word, you can
[1:16:26] never go back. There is just no way you
[1:16:29] can go back. Oh, you know, I tell you
[1:16:32] what won me over was a chocolatecovered
[1:16:36] Oreo. My last thing on earth I should
[1:16:39] have been eating, but the man comes and
[1:16:41] says, "Just take a bite out of
[1:16:44] this. My I took a bite. I'm
[1:16:48] one." Sister Jerry would only let me buy
[1:16:50] one more.
[1:16:53] But otherwise, I'd be How many are in
[1:16:56] that case? How many are there? But you
[1:16:59] see, my brother and sister, it will
[1:17:00] never take a
[1:17:03] bite. We'll never know how good it is.
[1:17:07] Amen. And that's what the word is doing
[1:17:10] to you and I. The scripture says that we
[1:17:14] come and we took a bite and it was sweet
[1:17:17] in our mouth but bitter in our belly.
[1:17:21] And some people the only thing they
[1:17:23] remember about the gospel, it was bitter
[1:17:25] in their belly. That's it. But some they
[1:17:29] come back and say, "I have to have
[1:17:31] another bite and another bite and
[1:17:35] another bite and another bite." And some
[1:17:38] say, "I tried that church thing." That's
[1:17:40] it. You tried a church thing. You never
[1:17:41] come to a living word. You never come to
[1:17:44] Christ in his word in you. You just came
[1:17:47] to a church, to a religion, to a
[1:17:49] following.
[1:17:51] And what we got to do is come to a
[1:17:52] living word that is vibrant. so vibrant
[1:17:56] that it causes
[1:17:58] you. It causes you. I I just have a very
[1:18:01] poor analogy, but back in my days of of
[1:18:04] riding in the desert before you ever got
[1:18:06] on the bike, it's just warming up. I
[1:18:09] would get an adrenaline rush that my
[1:18:10] hands would shake and that was just at
[1:18:13] the thought of riding the
[1:18:18] bike. Lord, help us to come to that
[1:18:21] place as we come in the house of God
[1:18:25] that we would just have a vibration as
[1:18:27] it were. We'd have such an excitement.
[1:18:31] We'd have such a
[1:18:32] thrill that we would be just so
[1:18:35] ready and we would be there to come at
[1:18:39] the opening of the doors because there's
[1:18:42] a living God inside there. And I so
[1:18:45] desire to be in his presence.
[1:18:48] I'm excited to be in the house of God.
[1:18:51] Amen. But look what Satan's done to
[1:18:54] every one of us.
[1:18:57] Our flesh is weaker than ever. I was
[1:19:00] just talking with a man the other day.
[1:19:02] He was telling me about his
[1:19:04] grandfather, what his grandfather used
[1:19:07] to do for work and what his father did
[1:19:08] for work. And this guy was in good good
[1:19:11] health, very good health and good
[1:19:13] fitness. And he's like, I can't even
[1:19:16] fathom doing what they did.
[1:19:20] And then he blew me away. He said, we're
[1:19:23] just so much weaker now than they were.
[1:19:30] Take it from the physical
[1:19:32] into the spiritual element.
[1:19:39] My Lord, I desire to have your strength.
[1:19:42] Yeah. I desire to have your spirit, have
[1:19:45] your courage. I desire that when I am
[1:19:48] sick to be able to stand up with
[1:19:51] confidence and say, "I'm healed in the
[1:19:53] name of Jesus Christ." When my life is
[1:19:56] in the bottom of a valley somewhere,
[1:19:59] give me the strength, Lord, to say, "I
[1:20:01] have the same God, the same experience
[1:20:04] as I had on top of that mountain. Is God
[1:20:08] with me here in the valley?" Amen. Amen.
[1:20:11] no matter what our circumstance is to
[1:20:13] come to the place that we desire to
[1:20:16] claim the goodness of God above all
[1:20:20] other exper experience or condition.
[1:20:26] Amen. But we need the same spirit that
[1:20:28] gave it to teach it to us. Oh, how we
[1:20:31] need revelation by the spirit. We don't
[1:20:35] need a new Bible. We need a new trans uh
[1:20:38] uh we don't need a new translation
[1:20:40] though some are very good and I'm not
[1:20:42] against them but we need the revelation
[1:20:46] of the spirit. Amen. This is what we
[1:20:49] really need. We don't let me put it this
[1:20:51] way. We don't need a bunch of new
[1:20:52] doctrines. Amen. We don't need to come
[1:20:55] with a new something that we've pulled
[1:20:57] out of it and said now you got to line
[1:20:58] up with this here. We don't need that.
[1:21:00] What we need is the spirit of the
[1:21:03] revelation of the spirit. Amen. And
[1:21:05] thank God we can have what we need for
[1:21:08] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:21:10] his spirit. Amen. And we know he wants
[1:21:12] to reveal the word by his spirit more
[1:21:14] than we even want it. More than we even
[1:21:18] search for it. He wants to give it to
[1:21:20] you and I make it real in our lives.
[1:21:23] Amen. May God begin by his spirit to
[1:21:26] give us continuous life giving and
[1:21:29] prevailing revelation. Oh, if the church
[1:21:31] could only get a fresh revelation and
[1:21:33] become by it the living word manifested,
[1:21:37] we would do the greater works and
[1:21:39] glorify God our father in heaven. Amen.
[1:21:42] Can I read that again? If the church
[1:21:44] could only get a fresh revelation and
[1:21:47] become by it the living word manifested.
[1:21:52] It's possible for you and I to become
[1:21:54] the living word in this age. We don't
[1:21:56] just need a cloak of religion. We need a
[1:22:00] living, vibrating, vibrant word living
[1:22:03] inside of our souls. Something that
[1:22:05] serves us, moves us in a time of sorrow,
[1:22:09] moves us in a time of travail, moves us
[1:22:12] in a time of our weakness, moves us in
[1:22:14] the greatest challenges of life back to
[1:22:17] the word. Where's my answer? The word.
[1:22:20] Where's my life? The word. Where's my
[1:22:22] strength? The word. Where's my peace?
[1:22:24] The word. Amen. not out here and
[1:22:28] trusting in this book over here and this
[1:22:30] book over there, not trusting in this
[1:22:32] great movement. My brother and sister, I
[1:22:35] tell you, it's so sorry to say this so
[1:22:37] strongly, but in the world of religion
[1:22:40] is nothing more than using religion or
[1:22:42] the Bible to produce cash for their own
[1:22:45] good. That's exactly right. That ought
[1:22:48] to be the last thing we think about.
[1:22:50] That's it. Amen. The word of God deals
[1:22:52] with those things. Just get the people
[1:22:54] to believe the simple word. You don't
[1:22:56] have to have this phony for
[1:22:58] $5,000. I'll pray a prayer of
[1:23:01] deliverance for you. Amen. If they're a
[1:23:03] minister of the gospel, that's their
[1:23:05] job. Amen. There shouldn't be anything
[1:23:08] about how much money would be attached
[1:23:10] to it. It should be that they would be
[1:23:12] such sold out servants of God that if
[1:23:15] there was nothing but crackers and
[1:23:17] branchwater, they would still stand
[1:23:19] there and labor for the people. Amen.
[1:23:23] The word actually calls them hierlings.
[1:23:25] I don't know why I said that, but that's
[1:23:27] the truth. Amen.
[1:23:34] Jumping back up in this, but we need the
[1:23:36] same spirit that gave it to teach it to
[1:23:38] us.
[1:23:40] Amen. Don't need another man coming and
[1:23:43] saying, "I got a greater revelation than
[1:23:45] the Apostle Paul."
[1:23:48] Do we
[1:23:49] have might as well address
[1:23:53] this? Do we have greater revelation? The
[1:23:55] Apostle
[1:23:57] Paul tricky, isn't
[1:24:00] it? We won't go to into it today, but
[1:24:04] what does the Bible
[1:24:07] say that they without us That's right.
[1:24:12] That's right. That's right.
[1:24:15] God unfolding his word, opening it up.
[1:24:18] He's opened up more in each age, each
[1:24:21] time coming to the passing of time.
[1:24:24] Without being arrogant, without being
[1:24:25] heady, without being highminded, without
[1:24:28] being boasters, we can say this is the
[1:24:30] age. This is the season when the full
[1:24:33] manifestation of the mystery of God has
[1:24:36] been revealed. So yes, we could say we
[1:24:39] actually have more than the Apostle
[1:24:41] Paul, but he is the foundation of what
[1:24:43] we do have. And you pull the foundation
[1:24:46] out, there's nothing. That's right.
[1:24:48] Amen. So the fact that God has added to
[1:24:51] and opened and showed us, my brother and
[1:24:53] sister, we can't say, "Well, the Apostle
[1:24:56] Paul's no longer an anchor point for our
[1:24:58] He is because the word said." That's
[1:25:01] right. The word said he was. Right.
[1:25:03] Absolutely right. But we're not under
[1:25:05] that. We are We are not less. And part
[1:25:10] of it is because there had to be a
[1:25:11] people that would live the word the
[1:25:13] Apostle Paul spoke. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:25:17] right. I desire to be that person that's
[1:25:18] living the word the Apostle Paul spoke.
[1:25:21] Amen. To be living in this wicked age
[1:25:23] that we live in. My goodness. I just
[1:25:26] read an article, my brother and sister,
[1:25:28] about how that there's pressure now
[1:25:30] under this new presidency to to push
[1:25:33] back on what is allowable for children.
[1:25:37] Do you know, I won't have the dates
[1:25:38] right, but do you know what is allowable
[1:25:41] for children right now? Oh, what was
[1:25:43] that 26 years ago or something like that
[1:25:46] they said was classified as pornography?
[1:25:48] That's exactly right. Now it's open for
[1:25:50] kids, little kids, 5y olds, 7, 10, 12.
[1:25:55] Tell me this isn't a more wicked age.
[1:25:57] Tell me this is not an age that is
[1:25:59] filling up with the spirit of Sodom.
[1:26:02] Tell me that it's it's, you know, it's
[1:26:04] just horrible. And and the problem is,
[1:26:06] see, we've been so immersed in the
[1:26:08] atmosphere of this age, of these times,
[1:26:12] that we become numb to it. And that's
[1:26:14] exactly what Satan wants. He doesn't
[1:26:16] need to get you out of the church. He
[1:26:17] doesn't make you dress uh immoral and
[1:26:20] act immoral and do all this immoral. He
[1:26:22] just numbs us.
[1:26:26] Now, a few people can handle having a
[1:26:28] tooth pulled without it being numbed.
[1:26:32] But we'd be brushing our teeth. If we
[1:26:34] ever felt that pain when we were about 5
[1:26:36] years old, no one would ever have to say
[1:26:39] to you ever again, "Brush your
[1:26:42] teeth." It would be like, "I want to
[1:26:44] keep all my teeth, and I don't want to
[1:26:45] experience that. I'll take good care."
[1:26:48] But you see, we become numbed to the
[1:26:50] Hershey bar before bed.
[1:26:53] We become numb to this. We come numb to
[1:26:56] that. Amen. Preach it. My own children
[1:26:59] and half the children in the church
[1:27:01] here. You
[1:27:04] know, water is such an incredible drink.
[1:27:09] It's a foundation of everything. Amen.
[1:27:16] But Pepsi tastes better. Yeah. Does it
[1:27:19] really?
[1:27:22] The truth of it is none of them. Dr.
[1:27:28] Pepper. Yeah. They don't really taste
[1:27:31] better cuz I'll guarantee you. Oh my.
[1:27:34] Let's go into a nostalgic moment. If you
[1:27:37] drank a Dr. Pepper from the 60s and
[1:27:40] drank a Dr. Pepper from
[1:27:43] 2025, you'd realize how they have fooled
[1:27:47] you. They don't even taste the same.
[1:27:52] You had the
[1:27:54] gospel from the 60s and the gospel. Now,
[1:27:58] you'd realize how we've been
[1:28:01] fooled cuz little substitute this,
[1:28:05] little substitute of that, add a little
[1:28:07] of this. Oh, now it tastes the same.
[1:28:14] Just go to a plant and watch how they
[1:28:16] make high fructose corn syrup and you'd
[1:28:18] never touch another thing that had high
[1:28:20] fructose corn syrup again in your
[1:28:23] life. It's this gooey syrup that you can
[1:28:27] actually glue boards together with.
[1:28:29] Yeah. And that's what you love so much.
[1:28:36] You know why churches get big?
[1:28:40] because they got a lot of syrup in there
[1:28:43] to glue the whole program together.
[1:28:48] Nothing wrong with a big church if they
[1:28:50] preach the pure word. Amen. If their
[1:28:53] desire is to Christ and Christ alone,
[1:28:56] it's
[1:28:57] okay. Let me go
[1:28:59] on. We can just touch on this real
[1:29:02] quick. Second
[1:29:04] Corinthians. Now, look at this. Do we
[1:29:07] commend ourselves? Oh, I'm such a
[1:29:09] Christian. Do we need we as some others
[1:29:11] epistles of commenation to you or
[1:29:14] letters of commenation from you? No. You
[1:29:17] see, God is the one who gives the
[1:29:20] commenation. Ye are our epistle written
[1:29:23] in our hearts, known and read of all
[1:29:24] men. For as much as ye are manifestly
[1:29:27] declared to be the epistle of Christ,
[1:29:29] ministered by us. See, Paul's a pretty
[1:29:31] bold
[1:29:32] man. He'd never make it in this day. You
[1:29:35] imagine? You'd want to clean out a big
[1:29:37] church, you know, just have the Apostle
[1:29:39] Paul come, man. He would clean out a
[1:29:42] church. They wouldn't even be able to
[1:29:43] pay their mortgage because there
[1:29:45] wouldn't be enough people left that
[1:29:46] wanted to hear the word preached like
[1:29:48] that. That's right. Amen. You'd been
[1:29:51] declared to be an epistle of Christ,
[1:29:52] ministered by us, written not with ink,
[1:29:54] but with the spirit of the living God.
[1:29:58] That's what I desire. That's it. The
[1:30:00] spirit of the living God. Not not just
[1:30:02] to hear words that make me feel good,
[1:30:04] but the spirit of the living God and not
[1:30:07] on tables of stone. Here we have this.
[1:30:09] Now, this I hope this don't go over
[1:30:11] wrong. I hope you don't misunderstand
[1:30:13] me. Amen. I'll tell you cuz taking what
[1:30:15] Paul said, I don't even want it written
[1:30:18] just right here, saints.
[1:30:22] It's got to be written right here. Amen.
[1:30:26] I can quote it from
[1:30:28] here. Can I quote it from here? And I'm
[1:30:32] not talking about quoting words. I'm
[1:30:34] talking about the spirit, the revelation
[1:30:36] of a living God needs to be written
[1:30:39] right here.
[1:30:41] You know what? If we come now, I I I I
[1:30:43] don't want to get into this. There's so
[1:30:44] many varied opinions, but you know what?
[1:30:47] If they went across the earth and
[1:30:49] destroyed every single Bible there was,
[1:30:51] maybe you might hide one in a rock
[1:30:53] backyard or something, but you know,
[1:30:55] Bibles are gone,
[1:30:56] illegal. Would we cease to be
[1:30:59] Christians? No.
[1:31:02] In fact, I believe we would in a
[1:31:04] desperation
[1:31:06] get so much more serious. Amen.
[1:31:10] You know, in countries, communist
[1:31:13] countries years
[1:31:16] ago, our brother Ivan, sister
[1:31:19] Olga, Brother Vicilei, Brother Ivan,
[1:31:22] Sister Nadia, Sister Nadia is too young.
[1:31:25] Praise God.
[1:31:28] Do you know they used to pack pages of
[1:31:31] the Bible around because if they were
[1:31:32] caught with the Bible, they were thrown
[1:31:34] in prison and sometimes very hideous
[1:31:38] conditions. But imagine you desired the
[1:31:42] word of God so much that you read this
[1:31:45] single page front and back for so long
[1:31:49] you could quote
[1:31:50] it word for
[1:31:53] word. But the amazing thing about it
[1:31:56] because we have them in our midst and we
[1:31:58] saw it is it transferred off the page
[1:32:02] not to some cells in the brain but to
[1:32:06] some cells in the
[1:32:08] heart and it become such a living word
[1:32:11] to them that they took such
[1:32:16] risks. I wish we had recorded all that.
[1:32:19] Sister Olga wrote it down. All those all
[1:32:21] those stories, all those things, the
[1:32:24] miraculous. Yeah. Amen. Being chased
[1:32:27] with tracking dogs and God allowing
[1:32:30] those dogs to become deceived in their
[1:32:33] smell and wander off down another trail.
[1:32:37] These kind of things, not, oh, praise
[1:32:40] God, it's so easy to go to church,
[1:32:43] especially when we're having a potluck.
[1:32:46] Let it be real word of God vibrating in
[1:32:50] our soul. This is what I live for. This
[1:32:55] is what I will die for if necessary. Let
[1:32:59] me close
[1:33:00] here. Amen.
[1:33:06] See, we've been
[1:33:10] declared and touched with the spirit of
[1:33:13] the living God, not on the stone, but on
[1:33:16] the table of the heart. Amen. And such
[1:33:18] trust have we through Christ to God
[1:33:20] word, not that we are sufficient of
[1:33:22] ourselves to think anything as of
[1:33:25] ourselves, but our sufficiency is of
[1:33:28] God. Amen. Amen. You know, it's nice.
[1:33:32] God's blessed us. We have many, many
[1:33:34] material things that make our life
[1:33:36] easier. But my brother and sister, I
[1:33:39] desire more and more as time is going
[1:33:41] on, a sufficiency that comes from the
[1:33:44] Lord, not from what an investment or
[1:33:48] what what you have over here. What none
[1:33:50] of those things that that can go away
[1:33:52] tomorrow. Amen. Amen. Not to talk
[1:33:55] politics, but my brother and sister, you
[1:33:57] see how easy it is in the whole world,
[1:34:00] not just here in the United States, not
[1:34:01] North America, the whole world,
[1:34:03] economies, can go to bed, everybody's
[1:34:06] happy, wake up, and it's a disaster.
[1:34:08] Amen.
[1:34:10] But God, having written it on the table,
[1:34:13] fleshly table of your heart. You go to
[1:34:16] bed happy, the world's falling apart,
[1:34:18] you get up in the morning, you're happy.
[1:34:21] Christ is my sufficiency.
[1:34:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Sister Sarah, would
[1:34:26] you
[1:34:28] come? You know, they say in the military
[1:34:30] world that a strong defense starts with
[1:34:33] a strong offense.
[1:34:36] Right?
[1:34:37] You see, if the enemy is already in your
[1:34:40] camp, it's much harder. Amen. Let's dig
[1:34:46] in. Let's have a strong offense. Let's
[1:34:48] put up the barrier of Christ in you
[1:34:52] between you and the devil. It'll be a
[1:34:55] lot easier than it will be trying to get
[1:34:57] our children back out. Reminds me this
[1:35:00] just carnal thing. This family in Texas
[1:35:02] was interviewed. They they're quite
[1:35:04] wealthy. But their neighbors all
[1:35:07] question. and they moved out of their
[1:35:08] big mansion in the city and moved to the
[1:35:09] country and bought a more modest home
[1:35:11] with a bunch of acres and and uh bought
[1:35:14] some cattle and bought horses for their
[1:35:15] kids and were driving their kids to this
[1:35:18] horse event and that horse event. And
[1:35:20] they set rules that their children
[1:35:22] needed to get up at 5 in the morning and
[1:35:24] take care of all of their animals. And
[1:35:27] if they didn't get it done, they would
[1:35:29] miss that day of school and you have
[1:35:31] troubles there. And the kids instead of
[1:35:34] rebelling, they was like, "I love my
[1:35:35] horse. I love my horses. They got up at
[1:35:38] 5 in the morning. They did their chores.
[1:35:40] They did what they were supposed to do.
[1:35:41] They got to the breakfast table. And
[1:35:43] people were saying, "You're too hard on
[1:35:44] your children. You should let them have
[1:35:46] it easier. This is not the old days."
[1:35:48] And the woman got a deal one day. She's
[1:35:50] the one that was writing about this. Her
[1:35:52] husband right there with her. She wrote,
[1:35:54] she says, "I will spend an unlimited
[1:35:56] amount of money on my children today to
[1:35:58] not spend it on rehab tomorrow.
[1:36:05] But you'll spend it.
[1:36:08] Come on, saints. That's it. We're going
[1:36:10] to spend time.
[1:36:13] Let the desire that Christ placed in
[1:36:15] you. Amen. Come to the forefront. Take
[1:36:19] the word. Eat the book. Amen. Amen. Cuz
[1:36:23] let me put it this way. You're going to
[1:36:25] eat some book. That's right.
[1:36:28] Just choose which book you want to eat.
[1:36:31] You're going to eat a
[1:36:33] book. Amen. Let's
[1:36:36] stand.

[1:43:30] never fail

[1:43:37] it goes on to say, you know, I love your
[1:43:40] voice. It's led me through the

[1:47:36] bridge, we don't ever sing it probably
[1:47:38] because I think I mess it up pretty
[1:47:41] good, but it says,
[1:47:43] uh, "With my life laid down, I surrender
[1:47:48] all. I give you everything. Your
[1:47:50] goodness is running after me." You
[1:47:52] believe that this morning? His word says

[1:50:21] Lord. For all you've done for
[1:50:28] me." And one
[1:50:31] day I'll reach heaven shore. Oh,
