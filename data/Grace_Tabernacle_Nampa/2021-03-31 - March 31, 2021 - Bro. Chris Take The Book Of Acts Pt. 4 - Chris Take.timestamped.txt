[30:15] 8 and Saul arose from the earth and when
[30:18] his eyes were opened he saw no man but
[30:21] they led him by the hand and brought him
[30:23] into Damascus and he and he was three
[30:26] days without sight neither did he eat
[30:28] nor drink and there was a certain
[30:30] disciple at Damascus named ananas and to
[30:33] him said the Lord in a vision ananas and
[30:36] he said behold I am here Lord and the
[30:38] Lord said unto him arise and go into the
[30:39] street which is called straet and
[30:41] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[30:44] called Saul of tarus for behold he
[30:47] prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man
[30:50] named ananas coming in putting his hand
[30:53] on him that he might receive his sight
[30:56] then ananas answered Lord I have heard
[30:58] by many of this man how much evil he
[31:00] hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and
[31:03] there he hath Authority from the chief
[31:05] priests to bind all that call upon thy
[31:08] name but the Lord said unto him go thy
[31:11] way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[31:14] Bear my name before the Gentiles and the
[31:16] king and Kings and the children of
[31:18] Israel for I will show him how great
[31:21] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[31:23] and ananas went his way and entered into
[31:26] the house and putting his hands on him
[31:28] said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus
[31:31] that appeared unto thee in the way as
[31:33] thou comest hath sent me that thou
[31:35] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[31:38] with the Holy
[31:40] Ghost and immediately there fell from
[31:42] his eyes as it had been scales and he
[31:44] received sight forth with and arose and
[31:47] was baptized when he received meat he
[31:49] was strengthened then was Saul certain
[31:51] days with the disciples which are at

[32:43] Lord and thank you in Jesus Christ's
[32:45] name we pray amen you may be seated
[32:48] tonight praise the
[32:54] [Applause]
[32:56] Lord so my title tonight is do you
[32:59] remember
[33:00] Grace we uh spoke last Wednesday uh the
[33:04] book of Acts part three we talked about
[33:06] Paul and his conversion on the road to
[33:08] Damascus and um how that we are called
[33:12] once we have seen the light and heard
[33:13] the voice we are called to be bearers of
[33:15] the light and so I wanted to pick up
[33:18] again here at Paul's conversion because
[33:22] the Lord tells ananas to go go thy way
[33:25] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[33:27] Bear my name before the Gentiles so
[33:30] Paul's uh Ministry was to go to the
[33:33] Gentiles but and that right there is the
[33:37] grace of God because the Jews were God's
[33:41] people his his uh little Benjamin his
[33:44] brothers Israel and that's where that's
[33:46] where the Lord came down he didn't come
[33:48] down to the Gentiles he came down to the
[33:51] Jews but for the grace of God he blinded
[33:53] their eyes so that we could see the
[33:55] truth and that right there is race and
[33:59] um that transition that he made there
[34:02] from the law into the dispensation of
[34:04] Grace he did so amen under grace because
[34:08] he gave us his message that was for the
[34:11] Jews but their eyes were blinded
[34:13] regardless they turned it down and uh we
[34:16] see that Paul was given the ministry to
[34:19] go to the Gentiles and that that was a a
[34:23] message of Grace and
[34:26] so remember that
[34:28] and we'll read this quote it's a little
[34:30] lengthy lengthy but that's okay um or I
[34:34] hope it's okay with yall 1954 the law
[34:36] having a shadow but R says then I
[34:39] thought well I'll find I looked across
[34:41] there and I said there's a place that's
[34:42] a restaurant just an ordinary place and
[34:45] I walked across there and this is
[34:47] shocking brother when as soon as I
[34:49] walked in the door there was a policeman
[34:51] standing there with his arm around a
[34:53] woman playing a slot machine gamblings
[34:55] illegal in Ohio and there was the law
[34:58] that's supposed to uphold righteousness
[35:00] gambling himself and he was a man as old
[35:02] as I am so he must have been married and
[35:04] had a wife somewhere else what a
[35:06] disgrace I looked back there and there
[35:08] was a young lady at the table waiting on
[35:10] some boys and they was all drunk and the
[35:13] way that young lady was acting letting
[35:14] them employ boys act to her it was a
[35:17] disgrace and I thought look you there if
[35:19] it isn't from Paradise into a rat Den
[35:22] almost he's um in between services on
[35:25] Sunday getting some lunch and he says
[35:27] listen let me tell you don't you worry
[35:29] about Russia coming over here and
[35:31] whipping the United States don't you
[35:33] worry about some Nation coming over here
[35:34] to whip on us we're whipping ourselves
[35:37] all morals is breaking down yes it isn't
[35:39] the robin that pecks on the Apple that
[35:41] hurts it it's the worm at the core that
[35:44] kills the apples that's what gets the
[35:46] apples so it isn't some other Nation
[35:48] it's our own self communism is not
[35:50] Russia communism is a spirit amen a
[35:54] little further down he goes on to say
[35:56] but notice this woman when she was
[35:58] sitting over there at that table that
[36:00] young woman I thought oh my and I looked
[36:02] over here and seen an old fellow sitting
[36:04] there and there said two fellows drunk
[36:06] one with a great big long Army Overcoat
[36:08] on and a dear old mother sitting there
[36:10] old enough to be my grandmother and the
[36:12] clothes that the woman had on little
[36:14] bitty short clothes and her poor poor
[36:16] old wrinkled arms and flesh and she had
[36:18] on this here manicure orever what you
[36:20] call it on her lips you know with that I
[36:22] know it's that's not the right stuff I
[36:25] can't ever what it what it is it's paint
[36:28] and she had it all over her lips like
[36:29] this and it was blue was blue looking
[36:32] you know and she had it and I looked at
[36:33] the poor old thing and she was sitting
[36:34] there with a cigarette smoking it and I
[36:38] looked and I thought oh my and two old
[36:40] men I said God why don't you just strike
[36:41] this thing off and just wipe it off the
[36:45] map you will be disgusted as well
[36:49] especially on
[36:50] Sunday you walk in and you see this you
[36:53] see this display of sin and your first
[36:56] reaction is to say
[36:58] these people are
[37:00] disgusting that's what's going through
[37:02] brother br's mind basically you would
[37:05] experience the same thing you do
[37:06] experience the same thing when you go
[37:07] and you say these people are disgusting
[37:10] this is gross what these people are
[37:13] doing but watch what God does and you
[37:16] all know the story so just slow down if
[37:19] me a sinner he said could look and just
[37:21] despise such as that how can your great
[37:24] Holiness look at such a thing as that
[37:26] and stand it I thought oh God my little
[37:28] Rebecca and Sarah are going to have to
[37:30] come up here one eight and the other 1
[37:33] three I thought how they going to come
[37:35] up here and see such as that what will
[37:37] it be in the in their day God why don't
[37:40] you just clean the thing up imagine what
[37:43] our what my kids are
[37:47] seeing amen I don't need to go into and
[37:49] explain it and then God taught me a
[37:52] lesson ain't he faithful yeah to do so
[37:55] we get a thinking in our own heads we're
[37:58] you know some big idea some big
[38:00] revelation we have and God comes along
[38:02] to teach us the lesson that's right you
[38:04] know the two men got up and went to the
[38:06] restroom and I was standing there
[38:07] looking around and I thought oh god look
[38:09] here what is it nobody yet waited on me
[38:11] I was just standing at the door looking
[38:13] around kind of dark back towards the
[38:14] door and the Holy Spirit said to me come
[38:16] over here and I went over and as I sat
[38:19] down see it's important to be sensitive
[38:20] to the moving of the holy spirit that
[38:22] still Small Voice in your heart being
[38:25] aware of it and being having the
[38:26] confidence to act upon it amen I I uh I
[38:31] myself have missed opportunities because
[38:33] I didn't have confidence that what I was
[38:35] what what was being ministered to my
[38:37] heart was not just my own idea or my own
[38:39] feeling but being in tune with God's
[38:42] moving of his spirit amen and doing what
[38:44] he asked you to do regardless of how
[38:46] awkward it may seem at the
[38:48] time and I saw and I went over and as I
[38:51] sat down I looked and I saw like the
[38:53] world and it was revolving around and
[38:55] around this world was a rainbow looked
[38:57] like a streak of red like a rainbow
[38:59] going around and around the world and
[39:02] then I went right into that and when I
[39:03] was standing
[39:05] there in that I looked and I seen
[39:07] somebody standing just above it with his
[39:08] arms out like this probably like this
[39:12] and it was our Lord and I noticed myself
[39:14] every time I go do something wrong just
[39:16] then according to Grace according to the
[39:18] word the father would have took my life
[39:20] right there but Christ every time I
[39:22] would do a sin then it would and he hits
[39:26] the pulpit it would hit him like that
[39:28] he'd shake his head like that in other
[39:29] words his blood was acting like a bumper
[39:31] on the automobile it was protecting me
[39:33] from death and I thought oh I see it I
[39:36] seen it come again and there was an old
[39:38] book laying out there and my name
[39:39] written at the top and it was a sinner's
[39:42] book smutted up amen I don't feel read
[39:45] to lead the read the entire quote if you
[39:47] want to go back you can but the Lord
[39:48] shows him that the blood his mistakes
[39:51] are going up and hitting the
[39:53] blood and he says and and and he looked
[39:56] back at me and say father forgive him
[39:57] and then I'd go along and do something
[39:59] else and there it would come again like
[40:01] that he'd say father forgive him I
[40:02] thought oh I see if that's the reason
[40:04] God can't take the life of those people
[40:06] Sinners because they are yet protected
[40:08] they have a chance yet the blood of
[40:11] Jesus is still protecting
[40:16] them and then I seen him as my sins kept
[40:19] beating him I got so broken hard and I
[40:21] come crawling up to him I laid down like
[40:23] this I said Lord look at my name up
[40:25] there I said is that my name he said yes
[40:27] that's your name amen is your name on
[40:29] the Lamb's Book of Life Tonight by God's
[40:31] grace I said God forgive me I didn't
[40:34] mean to make you suffer like that says
[40:37] please forgive me he took his hand in
[40:39] his side like that and rode across there
[40:42] pardoned he said now I forgive you but
[40:45] you want to condemn her right Amen in
[40:48] this moment that brother bradam was
[40:50] standing
[40:52] there God had to remind him of Grace
[40:56] Grace is the blood of Jesus Christ shed
[40:58] for your sins to bring you protection
[41:00] here on Earth God had to remind him of
[41:03] Grace you say the prophet yes the
[41:06] prophet God had to remind him so how
[41:09] much more amen do we need to be in
[41:11] remembrance of Grace and he said he says
[41:14] then that made things different I come
[41:17] out of the vision I looked over there
[41:18] that poor old woman sitting there
[41:20] toddling now he says that poor old woman
[41:22] amen he doesn't describe how gross and
[41:25] how disgusting now it's a that poor
[41:26] woman just toddling like that I said
[41:28] Lord God please forgive me I'll not be
[41:31] critical anymore I walked over to where
[41:34] she was and I said how do you do he sat
[41:38] down and he talked with her first he was
[41:40] ready to condemn her ready to have God
[41:42] strike her dead but then God showed him
[41:45] God said let come here son let me REM
[41:48] remind you of Grace let me remind you of
[41:50] the grace of God that I even is is shed
[41:54] over you is put over you on the daily
[41:56] basis that you live even you are making
[41:59] mistakes and that's going up and
[42:00] covering by the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:02] and you're ready to condemn her and what
[42:06] sometimes what happens is we can forget
[42:09] about God's grace we can get to a place
[42:12] where we're we're comfortable doing
[42:14] church and we're comfortable we don't
[42:16] have anything big in our lives we don't
[42:19] have any this any that well what
[42:21] happened is you may not need to be
[42:22] delivered from smoking you may not need
[42:24] to be delivered from lust you may not
[42:26] need to be delivered from carousing and
[42:28] going out in the world but you needed to
[42:30] be delivered from self-righteousness you
[42:32] need to be you need to be reminded of
[42:34] God's grace and reminded that the grace
[42:37] that God gave to you is still available
[42:40] to every living soul that is out there
[42:42] around us amen do you remember Grace and
[42:45] so he he sits down he talks to her and
[42:48] he in in that moment he he extends the
[42:53] grace of God to her and he and he begins
[42:56] to talk to her you know what what is
[42:59] what is he starts the
[43:00] conversation what basically what is
[43:02] wrong with your life and she told him
[43:05] the whole story you know she was she was
[43:07] cast out and all these things happened
[43:09] everything and he led her to the Lord
[43:11] right there not because he went up there
[43:13] and tried to correct her for her
[43:16] sin they would have chased him out or
[43:18] she would have slapped him in the
[43:20] face because that's not what God did to
[43:22] you God didn't come up there with a
[43:25] stick ready to smack you upside the head
[43:26] because you were sinning he said Son let
[43:29] me tell you about my grace he said
[43:31] daughter let me tell you about my grace
[43:33] that I have for you and at the same time
[43:36] you need to remember Grace because
[43:38] you've got a self-righteous attitude and
[43:40] you and you can tend to think maybe not
[43:42] even realizing that you're better than
[43:43] the next person but you can also need to
[43:46] be reminded of Grace because you beat
[43:47] yourself down too much and you forget
[43:50] that God's grace covers your sins you
[43:53] are no longer a sinner having received
[43:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you stand
[43:58] in confidence you stand shadowed by
[44:02] Grace you stand shadowed by the blood of
[44:04] Jesus Christ and your name is written on
[44:07] the Lamb's Book of Life the remembrance
[44:09] of things that you have done wrong where
[44:12] does that come from I come straight from
[44:14] the pits of Hell God doesn't remember it
[44:17] it's forever put in the sea of God's
[44:19] forgetfulness roten off washed away amen
[44:23] by the bleach the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:25] amen do you remember Gra
[44:28] we can read about another man in the
[44:30] book here in Jonah
[44:37] 3 some of you can quote the
[44:41] story and the word of the Lord came
[44:43] under Jonah the second time Jonah gone
[44:45] down into the well Belly of the fish I
[44:49] always want to say that backwards but
[44:51] arise and go un n Nineveh that great
[44:53] City and preach unto it the preaching
[44:55] that I bid thee so Jonah arose and went
[44:58] unto Nineveh according to the word of
[45:00] the Lord now Nineveh was an exceeding
[45:02] great city of 3 days journey and Jonah
[45:06] began to enter into the city a Day's
[45:08] Journey so to go from one end of the
[45:10] city to the other on foot took three
[45:12] days and Jonah began to enter this into
[45:15] the city a day journey and he cried and
[45:17] said yet 40 days in Nineveh shall be
[45:20] overthrown so the people of Nineveh
[45:23] believed God and proclaimed a fast and
[45:25] put on sackcloth from the Great of them
[45:27] even to the least of them would you
[45:30] imagine an entire
[45:32] city
[45:34] of six six score thousand
[45:38] so I don't know 12 12,000 120,000
[45:42] something like that correct my math but
[45:45] it was a
[45:46] lot uh you walk down the
[45:49] streets preaching and the entire city
[45:53] begins to repent and that's what
[45:54] happened you think wow a Revival miracle
[45:57] but let's see what happens here to Jonah
[45:59] and for word came unto the king of
[46:01] Nineveh and he rose from his throne and
[46:03] laid his robe from him and covered him
[46:05] with
[46:06] sackcloth and sat in ashes and he caused
[46:09] it to be proclaimed and published
[46:11] through Nineveh by the decree of the
[46:12] king and his Noble saying let neither
[46:15] man nor Beast herd nor flock taste
[46:17] anything let them not feed nor drink
[46:19] water but let man and Beast be covered
[46:22] with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God
[46:24] when as far as to put sackcloth and
[46:26] Ashes on their cattle on their cows let
[46:29] them turn everyone from his evil way and
[46:31] from the violence that is in their hands
[46:34] who can tell if God will turn and repent
[46:36] and turn away from his Fierce anger that
[46:37] we perish not and God saw their works
[46:40] that they turned from their evil way and
[46:42] God repented of the evil that he had
[46:44] said that he would do unto them and he
[46:46] did it not there's still walls of
[46:49] Nineveh standing to this day there was a
[46:52] the big gate but Isis Isis blew it up
[46:55] but there's walls still there that you
[46:57] can see amen perhaps a reminder to
[47:02] Iraq that God's truth is still
[47:05] alive but it displeased Jonah
[47:07] exceedingly and he was very angry
[47:15] what imagine a
[47:17] preacher in in our time preaching a
[47:21] power sermon and the altar full of
[47:24] people repenting and he storms off in
[47:27] anger that's what Jonah did he stormed
[47:30] off in Anger first of all Jonah was a
[47:34] backsliding preacher so brother R calls
[47:37] him he went running off the tares he
[47:40] says I ain't going to go to Nineveh
[47:42] Nineveh had a reputation that was you
[47:43] know like like Las Vegas right I've
[47:46] driven through Las Vegas a few times I'd
[47:48] rather drive around
[47:50] it right that's how Nineveh
[47:53] was and um so did uh do you want to go
[47:58] walking down the streets of Las Vegas
[48:00] saying
[48:02] repent not unless God God told you to
[48:05] and even then Jonah ran right so who
[48:07] knows you don't know until you walked a
[48:10] mile in their moccasins as the saying
[48:11] goes so Jonah says forget this I'm not
[48:13] following the word of the Lord I'm going
[48:15] to Tarsus gets on a ship I think get
[48:17] funny he's got to run from the presence
[48:19] of the
[48:20] Lord sometimes we get crazy ideas in our
[48:22] heads and God has to teach us the lesson
[48:25] so Jonah goes off now
[48:27] now God um God knows and God works
[48:32] things out and and if he if if you will
[48:34] if you permit me to take a little side
[48:36] step here when Jonah's on the boat and
[48:39] the the storm comes up and tosses the
[48:42] ship back in forth and and and um I'm
[48:45] talking like this ship's about about to
[48:47] sink and you have all these Sailors on
[48:49] the ship and they're all praying to
[48:52] their gods it
[48:53] says and um they they they finally get
[48:57] everyone together and they cast lots and
[48:58] the lot falls on Jonah and Jonah tells
[49:01] him his
[49:02] testimony and then they begin to call on
[49:05] the Lord God the Bible says and then
[49:08] when they threw Jonah in the water they
[49:11] sacrificed it says they sacrificed to
[49:13] the Lord and made vows in other words
[49:17] they gave their heart to God so how do
[49:19] we know
[49:21] that that Jonah's desire to to to not to
[49:25] go against God's will wasn't actually
[49:28] God's will to bring those Sailors the
[49:30] message you never
[49:32] know amen praise the Lord and so you see
[49:37] another display of God's grace so Jonah
[49:40] had had had this thought in his head
[49:43] that he was doing what he was wanting to
[49:45] do but God was writing a story of Grace
[49:49] the sailors received the message and
[49:50] then we know that that uh the Nineveh
[49:53] believed in the fish God and here Jonah
[49:55] comes walking out of fish so God has a
[49:58] way of doing things that is entirely
[50:00] different to ours so don't ever look
[50:03] amen do you remember Grace don't look at
[50:06] somebody and judge them for what they're
[50:07] doing CU you don't know God might be
[50:09] working the whole thing out to his will
[50:12] and
[50:13] so so here's Jonah he says you know what
[50:17] toss me overboard right he he's coming
[50:19] into a it takes a humble and a broken
[50:21] Spirit to say it's my fault toss me
[50:23] overboard that's the last thing last
[50:25] place you want to go on a storm because
[50:27] it's um what's the word it's uh um
[50:32] you're going to die there's no there's
[50:34] no U untruth about it you're going to if
[50:37] you're going overboard you're dying so
[50:40] they fought the sailors fought to
[50:41] prevent it and to to to hold the ship
[50:44] but they couldn't so they finally threw
[50:45] him overboard and and um so Jonah sinks
[50:48] down and fish a fish the Bible says
[50:51] swallows him up so now you have Jonah
[50:53] and a fish and he's thinking you know
[50:56] what that was probably not the greatest
[50:58] idea I ever had to uh try to run from
[51:01] the presence of God and so he he takes
[51:04] and this is the best thing you can do
[51:05] when you find yourself in the belly of a
[51:08] fish apply God's word to your life
[51:11] brother BR says it's 180° shift right
[51:15] you just go the other way if you find
[51:17] yourself in wrong you turn around and go
[51:20] the other way did you know that if
[51:21] you're going uh the Bible says your sins
[51:23] are gone as far as the East is from the
[51:25] West did you know if you're going West
[51:27] and you want to go East all you have to
[51:28] do is turn
[51:29] around you don't have to go find East
[51:33] and you can go east for as long as you
[51:34] want and never ever find West unless you
[51:37] turn around that's right that's why
[51:40] brother that's why you can't look back
[51:42] behind you don't look back to those sins
[51:44] that are as far as the East is from the
[51:46] West because East never connects to the
[51:48] West in that sense right you go east as
[51:51] long as you can you're never ever going
[51:53] to come West but anyway so here Jonah
[51:57] and he turns toward the
[51:59] temple best he could guess and he prays
[52:02] and God pro keeps him alive for three
[52:05] days am me a type of Christ three days
[52:08] in the ground and he brings him out and
[52:11] then he tells him again okay Jonah go to
[52:14] Nineveh so now Jonah just experienced a
[52:19] uh um a tremendous testimony of God's
[52:22] grace he was given a second chance he
[52:24] was given another chance to go do what
[52:27] God had origin originally told him to do
[52:29] and he walks into the city this is funny
[52:33] how sometimes you know it's like that
[52:35] story
[52:36] um in the Bible the the the man he's
[52:39] he's given a chance he says hey look
[52:41] Lord uh king or whatever just give me a
[52:43] chance I'll get the money and I'll pay
[52:45] it back and then a c and so he says okay
[52:48] your debts are forgiven and then a
[52:50] servant comes to that man and says
[52:52] please just give me some more time and
[52:54] he says no put him in prison
[52:56] he was extended Grace but he didn't turn
[52:59] around and extend that Grace that he was
[53:01] given how can God forgive you your sins
[53:04] if you won't forgive your brother their
[53:05] trespasses the Bible says so what
[53:08] happens is you turn Grace into disgrace
[53:11] and so here's Jonah and he's walking out
[53:13] and he's just like the man giv another
[53:15] chance forgiven of his debts and he goes
[53:17] into Nineveh and he preaches the message
[53:19] that God had given him and then when the
[53:21] people begin to repent he gets
[53:24] upset why why is he not extending that
[53:27] same Grace he was given in the belly of
[53:30] the fish right to the people of nin
[53:34] Nineveh you would think well what
[53:36] happened in that short time Jonah forgot
[53:38] about Grace so he had to be reminded of
[53:42] it and oh ain't that the truth God will
[53:44] remind you the devil will remind you but
[53:47] the devil has a perversion of what God
[53:50] does and the devil doesn't have guess
[53:52] what the devil has no original idea
[53:57] he's a
[54:00] parrot but he twists it to his own gain
[54:03] and he makes it evil makes good evil so
[54:07] God is going to put Jonah in remembrance
[54:10] he's going to teach Jonah a lesson and
[54:13] so um but it displeased Jonah we're in
[54:16] chapter 4 if you're reading along but it
[54:17] displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was
[54:19] very angry and he prayed unto the Lord
[54:22] and said I pray thee Oh Lord was this
[54:24] was not this my saying when I yet in my
[54:28] country in other words which is funny
[54:32] when he's in
[54:36] Israel he said he knew God was going to
[54:38] forgive
[54:39] him but yet he didn't want to go
[54:42] therefore he said what I when I was yet
[54:44] in my country therefore I have fled
[54:46] before unto Tarsus for I knew that thou
[54:48] are a gracious God and merciful slow to
[54:52] anger and of great kindness and
[54:53] repentance thee of evil there now oh
[54:56] Lord take I beseech thee my life from me
[54:58] for it is better for me to die than to
[55:01] live you see there was in the natural
[55:04] Jonah was coming off of what's called
[55:06] inspiration so he was experiencing a
[55:09] moment of melancholy is what it's called
[55:12] Uh you pray for preachers they they go
[55:14] through that same thing Thursday morning
[55:17] after you're preaching is the worst
[55:18] morning of the
[55:20] week I don't say that to make you feel
[55:22] bad for me or trying to make myself
[55:23] special I'm just saying that's the fact
[55:25] so here's Jonah just in a a Revival
[55:28] preaching you know under the inspiration
[55:30] and then the inspiration goes away and
[55:31] he's like why are all you Wicked people
[55:33] repenting you need to be struck
[55:36] dead and so I can't stand this so he
[55:39] goes outside of the city to sit on a
[55:41] hill to watch God's judgment come and he
[55:44] says I didn't want to go to Tarsus Lord
[55:47] you ever you ever just you ever just
[55:49] vent to
[55:51] God In Prayer just I don't understand
[55:54] and so here's Jonah I I knew it he said
[55:57] I knew it God I knew that's why I didn't
[55:58] want to go here because I knew you'd
[55:59] forgive these Wicked people who need to
[56:07] die you're either thinking of yourself
[56:10] or somebody else you
[56:13] know that's the attitude we get
[56:17] sometimes because we forget about
[56:20] Grace we forget what God's done for us
[56:22] and we want to pass judgment on people
[56:24] and we want to seal their faith and we
[56:26] want to say you know we see that that
[56:28] gay dude in in Starbucks or that gay
[56:31] woman and we just want to just oh
[56:33] they're disgusting I can't even yes
[56:36] their sin is disgusting but that's a
[56:38] lost soul in need of Jesus Christ how
[56:42] will you conduct yourself don't condone
[56:44] their sin amen stand up and tell them
[56:46] the truth but there's a way to do it in
[56:49] the love of God you can say the same
[56:51] words but if your attitude isn't an
[56:53] attitude of Grace they're going to catch
[56:55] on to it
[56:56] because all of that is going on in the
[56:58] spiritual realm amen I've seen it done
[57:01] both ways in a way of an actual Love Of
[57:04] Christ expressed and the people receive
[57:07] it they don't get upset even though they
[57:09] know you disagree with them and then you
[57:10] see it the same thing happen in an
[57:12] attitude of aggression one of Flesh
[57:14] because they're upset this person is
[57:16] sinning and just creates an argument and
[57:20] that person what who knows where they go
[57:23] so it's all in in in in your heart
[57:26] that's what it comes down to amen cuz
[57:28] everything in life that we deal with in
[57:30] with people is not a condition of the
[57:32] flesh it's a condition of your heart
[57:35] that's right cuz if it was the condition
[57:36] of the flesh we would not be called Sons
[57:39] and Daughters of God but God looks at
[57:41] our heart that he is change and he says
[57:43] you know what the outside don't look
[57:44] right yet but it's coming from the
[57:47] inside out just like a worm ruins an
[57:49] apple the presence of God in your life
[57:53] fixes the
[57:54] apple and so Jonah gets upset so Jonah
[57:57] went out of the city and sat on the east
[57:59] side of the city and there made him a
[58:01] booth and sat under it in the shadow
[58:04] till he might see what would become of
[58:05] the city and the Lord God prepared a
[58:08] gourd and made it to come up over Jonah
[58:10] that he might be a shadow over his
[58:13] head to deliver him from his grief so
[58:16] Jonah was exceeding glad of the
[58:21] gourd one of my titles I had before I
[58:23] came up with this one was was uh sitting
[58:25] on under a gourd
[58:27] so maybe you find yourself sitting under
[58:30] a gourd tonight well just join up with
[58:32] Jonah but God prepared a worm when the
[58:34] morning Rose the next day and it smoke
[58:36] the gour that it
[58:38] withered and it came to pass when the
[58:40] sun did arise that God prepared a vinant
[58:43] East Wind and the Sun Beat upon the head
[58:46] of Jonah you know I wonder how many
[58:48] times uh one day comes to mind I was
[58:50] working in Phoenix landscaping and it
[58:52] was uh just about 120 it was like 115
[58:56] I wonder sometimes those days you have
[58:57] is not just the
[58:59] Lord teaching you a lesson right you
[59:02] just think it's a bad day but maybe the
[59:04] Lord's trying to show you something um
[59:07] praise the Lord and the son beat upon
[59:09] the head of Jonah that he fainted and
[59:12] wished in himself to die and said it is
[59:14] better for me to die than to live and
[59:17] God said to Jonah dust thou well to be
[59:19] angry for the gourd you're right you
[59:22] should be mad about the gourd and he
[59:24] said I do well to be angry even to death
[59:27] so God says to Jonah you you you you
[59:29] should be mad at the gour and Jonah says
[59:31] I am I'm mad at the gour that the gourd
[59:34] died then said the Lord see ah the Lord
[59:37] is just well he's all knowing so he
[59:39] knows how to do this stuff but he just
[59:40] he pulls in right he comes alongside
[59:42] Jonah says you're mad huh you're mad
[59:44] about the gour Jonah's like yeah I'm mad
[59:46] about the gour and then there's this
[59:47] there's this softness of his heart right
[59:50] even though he's upset there's this
[59:51] connection to God right God understands
[59:54] and then God says Thou Hast had pity on
[59:56] the G for the which thou Hast not
[59:57] labored J's like yeah I didn't even he
[1:00:00] says neither made a thck grow which came
[1:00:02] up in a night and perished in a night
[1:00:05] yeah and should not I spare Nineveh that
[1:00:07] great City wherein are more than six
[1:00:10] score thousand persons that cannot
[1:00:12] discern between their right hand and
[1:00:14] their left hand and also much cattle and
[1:00:16] that's the end of the book you know why
[1:00:19] Jonah learned his lesson Jonah
[1:00:21] remembered Grace and he went back down
[1:00:23] into the city we don't know anymore
[1:00:25] about Jonah he briefly mentioned in the
[1:00:27] book of
[1:00:28] Kings if it's the same man same name
[1:00:31] same father um but we know don't know
[1:00:34] much more about Jonah so perhaps Jonah
[1:00:37] went down into Nineveh and he preaches
[1:00:40] his first sermon to the new church of
[1:00:42] Nineveh and he says my title this
[1:00:45] morning is the grace of
[1:00:47] God and he talks about how you know he
[1:00:50] he went to run away from bringing them
[1:00:53] the message
[1:00:56] and he went to run away from
[1:00:58] preaching I tried to do that once don't
[1:01:00] ever do that and and he come back and he
[1:01:04] and he says you know what I sat on the
[1:01:06] hill and I wished God judgment upon
[1:01:10] you I wish all of you for your
[1:01:12] wickedness would have
[1:01:14] died I wish you would have been all
[1:01:17] destroyed but see God brought up this
[1:01:19] gourd it gave me some shade and then it
[1:01:22] died and I got really
[1:01:24] mad and then God reminded me you cared
[1:01:28] about that gourd that gave you shade and
[1:01:30] you had pity upon it that you did
[1:01:31] nothing to bring it
[1:01:33] up what about the people of Nineveh how
[1:01:36] much more important are they to you that
[1:01:39] I have come and I have risen up and I
[1:01:42] have given a second chance and he says
[1:01:44] so you know don't forget about God's
[1:01:46] grace amen so this is do you remember
[1:01:48] Grace part two Jo uncovered part
[1:01:51] one
[1:01:54] so praise the Lord
[1:01:56] instead of Min ministering to those
[1:01:58] people for 40 days being with them
[1:02:01] helping them he stood back to watch
[1:02:03] their
[1:02:05] judgment sometimes I get ahead of my
[1:02:07] notes forget I have notes Here praise
[1:02:10] the Lord
[1:02:12] now the same
[1:02:15] thing happened to brother brandham in um
[1:02:20] 1963 or in the message standing in the
[1:02:22] Gap right and these Ricky and ricettas
[1:02:26] have so sased the words and I've called
[1:02:29] them Ricky and Retta God give me to
[1:02:31] understand I shouldn't do that because
[1:02:33] that's many of them are still his
[1:02:35] children right I was listening to a
[1:02:38] brother actually it was brother Shawn
[1:02:40] Martin preaching uh back it was a few
[1:02:42] years ago and I was watching it as I was
[1:02:44] working and um he says preachers
[1:02:50] sometimes he says men sometimes take
[1:02:53] message and want to preach people into
[1:02:55] Bond and tell them how bad of a person
[1:02:57] they are and put them in prison he says
[1:03:01] we already know how bad we are we need
[1:03:04] to hear what God thinks about us so
[1:03:08] brother so the Lord is schooling the
[1:03:10] prophet here and he says you're calling
[1:03:11] these people Ricky and retas but they're
[1:03:13] my
[1:03:15] children but they yet they they're my
[1:03:17] children but they yet don't know it
[1:03:23] amen they can't help because they ask so
[1:03:26] different some of these old cold formal
[1:03:28] churches has got them in other words
[1:03:30] some of them cold formal churches have
[1:03:33] true Sons and Daughters of God that's
[1:03:36] denominations and that's those churches
[1:03:38] in the message same
[1:03:41] thing and there in much in in prison as
[1:03:44] Israel
[1:03:47] was he says formal churches has got them
[1:03:50] that Spirit upon them and they're in
[1:03:52] much in prison as Israel was in prison
[1:03:54] just as much as Moses went down to
[1:03:56] deliver them from slavery human beings
[1:03:58] that loved Jesus Christ would serve him
[1:04:01] if they only knew what to serve him by
[1:04:06] amen do you remember
[1:04:08] Grace and they are in bondage under
[1:04:12] denominationalism that tells them don't
[1:04:14] you do this and don't you do that
[1:04:17] amen the message he says the message
[1:04:20] won't denominate but I believe by
[1:04:23] prophetic Insight he's talking about the
[1:04:25] message churches yes denominationalism
[1:04:29] that tells them don't you do this and
[1:04:31] don't you do
[1:04:33] that nobody's going to you're going to
[1:04:36] get a bunch of people that are
[1:04:37] conforming and they're doing it and
[1:04:39] those that stag just because because
[1:04:41] they have greater
[1:04:42] self-discipline or there's just they're
[1:04:45] fine with living two
[1:04:47] lives rather let's preach the Gospel of
[1:04:50] Jesus Christ which is the power of God
[1:04:53] unto salvation we don't need we don't
[1:04:56] need to stand up here and and and put
[1:04:59] you behind bars cuz you're such a bad
[1:05:01] person or pray that God's judgment comes
[1:05:04] upon you because you're acting like a
[1:05:06] Nineveh Neva ninevite whatever a person
[1:05:10] of Nineveh we need to preach to you the
[1:05:13] Gospel of Jesus Christ which is the
[1:05:16] power of God unto salvation which is
[1:05:19] Paul's
[1:05:23] message Paul had to deal with a lot of
[1:05:25] starchy stuck up
[1:05:29] Jews he had to deal with a lot of
[1:05:31] problem
[1:05:34] churches that's why I believe he had the
[1:05:36] greatest experience of God's grace he
[1:05:39] was killing Christians having them put
[1:05:42] in prison having them
[1:05:44] beat and then God turns his life around
[1:05:46] and gives him makes has him be the first
[1:05:50] church age
[1:05:51] messenger wow God's grace
[1:05:56] there's there's there's there's Sons and
[1:05:58] Daughters of God who have been to prison
[1:06:01] for murder and now are are children of
[1:06:04] the king well they always were they just
[1:06:07] didn't know it amen you say God's grace
[1:06:10] is not amen there is nothing too great
[1:06:13] for the grace of God that's right
[1:06:15] nothing too great for the love of
[1:06:19] God but the call of God must come
[1:06:21] whoever wants to March towards the
[1:06:23] promised land let him March
[1:06:26] we're on our road to the promised land
[1:06:28] amen let them come I know people who
[1:06:31] quit young people who quit going to
[1:06:33] church because they thought they were
[1:06:35] sitting there hindering the church and
[1:06:37] that it would be better if they just
[1:06:39] left because of what the preacher said
[1:06:41] that's right let me ask you a question
[1:06:44] is that God's grace I don't care what
[1:06:47] kind of life you're living sit in that
[1:06:49] Pew come to church amen there's certain
[1:06:52] situations if you don't want to you
[1:06:55] don't have to but if you want to be here
[1:06:58] and you just can't get your life
[1:07:00] straightened out come God will
[1:07:02] straighten it out we have testimonies in
[1:07:05] this Church of God doing that very thing
[1:07:07] amen amen I remember a testimony of of a
[1:07:11] couple of of young men who were were
[1:07:14] young men and they went to go to a uh
[1:07:17] some of you will know him I'm not going
[1:07:18] to name them um to a youth camp and the
[1:07:20] Pastor said
[1:07:22] no they're not allowed to come here
[1:07:25] that's how bad off they were and they
[1:07:27] didn't want to be there they had bad
[1:07:29] attitudes but yet God took them see you
[1:07:32] look right now at some young person or
[1:07:34] you look right now at some old person
[1:07:36] older person and you see their life and
[1:07:38] you say what you can't see 20 years 10
[1:07:42] years 15 years down the road and see
[1:07:44] what God's going to turn their life
[1:07:45] around to be both those guys are now
[1:07:47] preachers of the Gospel
[1:07:49] amen praise the Lord that was I don't
[1:07:51] know where we were going with that one
[1:07:53] there but amen you never no we don't we
[1:07:57] want to preach the gun barrel straight
[1:08:01] gospel we're not going to conform we're
[1:08:04] not going to be Hypocrites we're not
[1:08:05] going to water it down but guess what
[1:08:09] we're going to do it under God's grace
[1:08:11] amen and underneath the inspiration of
[1:08:13] the Holy Ghost because God has given
[1:08:16] every single one of you an opportunity
[1:08:18] and who are we to say that you've lost
[1:08:20] that opportunity we're not going to know
[1:08:23] till the end of time Moses okay so he
[1:08:25] says but the call of God must come let
[1:08:27] him March okay we're on a road to the
[1:08:29] promised land let them come March we're
[1:08:31] on a road to meet Christ at the end time
[1:08:33] and I wanted to bring this to you so
[1:08:35] that you would see and show you that the
[1:08:37] mistake that a man can make yet being
[1:08:41] sincere Moses lost the feeling of his
[1:08:44] people because they wouldn't listen to
[1:08:48] him and brother Roy you see your dream
[1:08:51] now I cannot go with a Ministry like
[1:08:53] that until I feel different in my heart
[1:08:54] about it no matter if God didn't did
[1:08:57] tell me but that is that change that
[1:09:00] brother Roy that scene coming
[1:09:01] something's got to change me because I
[1:09:03] in my heart if I go out there feeling
[1:09:05] the way I do now I still feel that way
[1:09:07] ought to have heard that message in
[1:09:10] other
[1:09:12] words he preached the seals and he's
[1:09:14] saying these PE he got upset because
[1:09:16] they they have should have heard the
[1:09:17] message and they didn't they didn't
[1:09:19] catch it and he and he's losing the
[1:09:21] feeling for the people they ought to
[1:09:24] have done it he says and I don't have
[1:09:25] the feeling for the people that I should
[1:09:27] have until I can get that feeling there
[1:09:30] is no need in me going because I'd be a
[1:09:32] hypocrite and all these years I've tried
[1:09:34] to serve him with a true heart and I
[1:09:35] won't go out there being a hypocrite I
[1:09:37] got to feel that that isn't that I've
[1:09:40] got to feel that it isn't Ricky and
[1:09:43] Retta and it isn't this Bunch it's God's
[1:09:47] children that's in bondage that I must
[1:09:50] go to until I can feel that way I'll
[1:09:52] just have to loaf around preach some
[1:09:54] conventions and things but wait in other
[1:09:57] words God had to bring him aside and
[1:09:58] said do you remember
[1:10:00] Grace he had to come aside and and you
[1:10:03] forgive me I don't remember the details
[1:10:04] or how long he was off the field or if
[1:10:06] it was just a short time but God gave
[1:10:08] him that feeling for the people back um
[1:10:11] and and
[1:10:13] because do you remember Grace right we
[1:10:16] can't forget about God's grace we we
[1:10:20] have we can't forget that the only
[1:10:21] reason you're here isn't because of your
[1:10:24] doing right it's because sorry if I keep
[1:10:27] fiddling with this it's coming off my
[1:10:29] ear isn't because of what you did that's
[1:10:32] right it ain't your pride no that's what
[1:10:34] happened with the Jews and we're going
[1:10:35] to read that here but the Jews right and
[1:10:39] this is this is this is an interesting
[1:10:40] thing because you see this sometimes I
[1:10:43] mean people like you
[1:10:45] amen necessarily
[1:10:48] you but oh you know they take the they
[1:10:52] take the truth of we are the elect of
[1:10:54] God and pervert it into we are better
[1:10:57] than them that's
[1:10:59] right and then there's no feeling for
[1:11:02] the people that's right there's no way
[1:11:05] to extend God's grace and there's no way
[1:11:07] to share the truth with them if that's
[1:11:09] how you feel about it and so that's what
[1:11:11] happened the Jews they were the
[1:11:14] Jews those Gentiles what are they doing
[1:11:18] when the when the when the gospel went
[1:11:20] to the Gentiles there was a big Council
[1:11:23] all the apostles
[1:11:25] right all the big
[1:11:27] men got together you know they need to
[1:11:30] be
[1:11:31] circumcised Paul says whoa whoa whoa
[1:11:33] whoa whoa hold on a second here what are
[1:11:36] we preaching are we preaching the law or
[1:11:40] are we preaching the grace of God Amen
[1:11:42] what do they need to be circumcised In
[1:11:44] the Flesh when God now circumcises the
[1:11:46] heart that's right and they by God's
[1:11:48] grace figured it out but then he went he
[1:11:52] goes to he goes to uh well we'll read it
[1:11:56] you know what we're just going to skip
[1:11:57] ahead then we'll skip back Acts chapter
[1:11:59] 13 uh if you want to turn there you
[1:12:01] don't have to Acts chapter
[1:12:05] 13 excuse me verse uh
[1:12:08] 42 so Paul uh is is um partnered up with
[1:12:13] Barnabas and he goes out to Antioch I
[1:12:17] believe it is and he begins to preach
[1:12:19] and and when the Jews were gone out and
[1:12:21] and then they they they go to the
[1:12:23] synagogue they read the Scrolls and then
[1:12:25] the Jews there and they say Hey you know
[1:12:27] brother Paul or Saul at that point I
[1:12:32] think no
[1:12:35] Paul you have do you have any words to
[1:12:37] say so they get up and they preach okay
[1:12:40] oh wow brother Paul that was good verse
[1:12:42] 42 when the Jews were gone out of the
[1:12:44] synagogue the Gentiles besought that
[1:12:46] these words might be preached to them
[1:12:48] the next Sabbath so they weren't allowed
[1:12:51] to partake of the service if I read this
[1:12:53] correctly
[1:12:55] forgive me if I
[1:12:57] didn't and so they say hey preach to us
[1:12:59] next Sabbath now when the congregation
[1:13:01] was broken up many of the Jews and relig
[1:13:03] religious prelit followed Paul and
[1:13:05] Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded
[1:13:07] them to continue in the grace of God wow
[1:13:09] Brothers we enjoyed that amen continue
[1:13:12] in the grace of God yes amen right these
[1:13:15] Jews okay and the next Sabbath day came
[1:13:19] almost the whole city together to hear
[1:13:21] the word of God and when the Jews saw
[1:13:22] the multitudes they were filled with
[1:13:26] Envy
[1:13:29] jealousy and spake against those things
[1:13:31] which are spoken by Paul contradicting
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:35] blaspheming wait a second it was brother
[1:13:38] Paul and brother Barnabas last
[1:13:41] week now when they're preaching to those
[1:13:46] Gentiles it's Paul and Barnabas not
[1:13:50] brother you know some people do that
[1:13:52] right they don't call him brother
[1:13:53] brandom anymore he's brandom
[1:13:55] interesting anyways I'm not going to get
[1:13:57] on
[1:13:58] that and they and they they turn against
[1:14:01] this right they were stuck up it was for
[1:14:04] them and them only that's for and no
[1:14:07] more and then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[1:14:10] bold see there's a time to stand up and
[1:14:13] be
[1:14:14] bold all in God's in God's grace and it
[1:14:18] was necessary he said Paul and Barnabas
[1:14:20] waxed bold and said it was necessary
[1:14:22] that the word of God should first have
[1:14:24] been spoken to
[1:14:26] you but seeing you put it from you and
[1:14:29] judge yourself Unworthy of everlasting
[1:14:32] life low we turn to the
[1:14:35] Gentiles
[1:14:38] wait and judge yourselves unworthy they
[1:14:43] judged themselves in their Pious
[1:14:47] self-righteousness they cast judgment
[1:14:49] upon
[1:14:51] themselves God help us to remember Grace
[1:14:55] not to become Pious and
[1:15:00] self-righteous and uh praise the Lord
[1:15:04] for so hath the Lord commanded us saying
[1:15:06] I have set thee to be a light of the
[1:15:08] Gentiles that thou should us be for
[1:15:09] salvation unto the ends of the Earth and
[1:15:11] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[1:15:13] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[1:15:14] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:15:17] life
[1:15:19] believed and the word of the Lord was
[1:15:21] published throughout all the region and
[1:15:23] the Jews here we go stirred up The
[1:15:26] Devout and honorable women and the chief
[1:15:27] men of the city and raised persecution
[1:15:30] against Paul and Barnabas and expelled
[1:15:32] them out of their Coast but they shook
[1:15:34] off the dust of their feet against them
[1:15:35] and came unto Iconium and the disciples
[1:15:38] were filled with joy and with the Holy
[1:15:40] Ghost they shook their feet said we go
[1:15:42] to the Gentiles they gave them the
[1:15:45] chance God in his grace even though Paul
[1:15:48] was called the Gentiles still gave the
[1:15:50] Jews a chance amen underneath his
[1:15:52] ministry all those Jew he would have
[1:15:55] still gone to the Gentiles but those
[1:15:56] Jews could have accepted the
[1:15:58] truth but they turned it down because

[1:18:31] down amen praise God so and the
[1:18:34] disciples are filled with joy and with
[1:18:36] the Holy Ghost so Paul goes on to the
[1:18:38] Gentiles so the message was for the Jews
[1:18:40] but God's grace brought it to you now
[1:18:42] we're going to go read another story in
[1:18:44] the book of Acts because that's what
[1:18:45] we're on right now careful what you name
[1:18:48] a series you probably will never leave
[1:18:50] because the book of Acts I mean anything
[1:18:52] fits underneath that
[1:18:55] no it's all by the leading of the Holy
[1:18:56] Spirit if you forgive me uh chapter
[1:18:58] 10:23 if you want to turn there then
[1:19:01] called he them in and lodged them and on
[1:19:04] the tomorrow Peter went away with them
[1:19:05] and certain Brethren from japa
[1:19:07] accompanied him so the Jews were raised
[1:19:09] up they couldn't eat certain Meats they
[1:19:10] couldn't eat certain things because it
[1:19:12] was unclean God shows Peter a vision as
[1:19:15] he's in the vision seeing the food come
[1:19:17] down and God saying partake there's two
[1:19:19] men knocking at the door bringing coming
[1:19:22] to take Peter to this Roman Centurion
[1:19:27] Cornelius so he says come inside spend
[1:19:29] the night then we'll go
[1:19:31] tomorrow and the tomorrow after they
[1:19:33] entered into cesaria and Cornelius
[1:19:36] waited for them and had called together
[1:19:38] his Kinsmen and near friends and as
[1:19:40] Peter was coming in Cornelius met him
[1:19:43] and fell down at his feet and worshiped
[1:19:45] him but Peter took him up saying stand
[1:19:47] up I myself also in a man amen we still
[1:19:51] have that in our day people worshiping a
[1:19:54] man Y and that man never condemning it
[1:19:58] God help us not to get that way God help
[1:20:00] us not to lift men up cuz it's not about
[1:20:02] me it's not about Brother David it's not
[1:20:03] about our pastor I don't care to name
[1:20:05] any brother in the message you want
[1:20:06] who's a preacher or a pastor it's not
[1:20:07] about them they're no special more more
[1:20:09] special than you and if they think they
[1:20:10] are watch out God's going to bring them
[1:20:12] back down because they are God's
[1:20:17] servant that's why I pray the Lord
[1:20:19] always keep me humble but then when you
[1:20:22] pray for humility it seems like it's
[1:20:24] like praying for
[1:20:27] patience praise the Lord and Cornelius
[1:20:30] waited for them
[1:20:32] okay verse 26 but Peter took him up
[1:20:35] saying stand up by myself also in a man
[1:20:37] and as he talked with him he went in and
[1:20:39] found many that were come together and
[1:20:40] he said unto them you know how that it
[1:20:42] is unlawful thing for a man that is a
[1:20:45] Jew to keep company or come unto one of
[1:20:47] another Nation but God ha showed me that
[1:20:49] I should not call any man common or
[1:20:50] unclean therefore came I unto you
[1:20:52] without gain saying as soon as I was
[1:20:54] sent for I ask therefore for what intent
[1:20:57] ye have sent for me okay so hey God
[1:21:00] showed me a a vision I'm not supposed to
[1:21:02] be here but God show me a vision and by
[1:21:04] his word I've come into your house
[1:21:06] contrary to everything I was taught
[1:21:08] contrary to everything I was made to
[1:21:10] think about things but because of God's
[1:21:12] grace coming down now I can stand in
[1:21:14] your house and talk to you so what what
[1:21:15] do you have need of called into the
[1:21:19] house of the enemy the Romans what the
[1:21:22] Zealot the zealots the Jews the crazy
[1:21:24] used even Peter himself upset about was
[1:21:27] it paying taxes or something like that
[1:21:30] amen Peter used to have a in his heart
[1:21:32] towards the Romans the the soldiers and
[1:21:35] now God's taking him says hey you need
[1:21:37] to go preach to this Roman
[1:21:41] Centurion I'll be like hey
[1:21:44] Sean you need to get a ticket and go

[1:21:57] door you come with
[1:22:00] us right God shows you right God God
[1:22:04] you're going to know what God's will is
[1:22:06] when in situations like that but that's
[1:22:07] what it would be like
[1:22:10] right anyways okay here we go so um and
[1:22:13] cor Cornelius says well four days ago I
[1:22:16] was fasting until this hour and at the
[1:22:18] ninth hour I prayed in my house so he he
[1:22:19] was a Godly Man already and and behold a
[1:22:22] man stood Before Me In Bright clothing
[1:22:24] and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard
[1:22:26] and thy alms are had in remembrance in
[1:22:28] the sight of God send therefore to japa
[1:22:31] and call hither Simon whose sirname is
[1:22:32] Peter he is lodged in the house of one
[1:22:34] Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when
[1:22:36] he cometh shall speak unto thee
[1:22:38] immediately therefore I sent to thee and
[1:22:40] thou Hast well done that thou art come
[1:22:42] now therefore are we all here present
[1:22:44] before God to hear all things that are
[1:22:46] commanded thee of God talk about being
[1:22:48] in season and out of season so you're
[1:22:51] here preach to us then Peter opened his
[1:22:54] mouth and said of a truth I perceive
[1:22:55] that God is no respector of persons
[1:22:58] doesn't matter who you are where you
[1:23:00] come from what you're doing God can use
[1:23:04] you and change you but in every nation
[1:23:06] he that fearth him and worketh
[1:23:08] righteousness is accepted with
[1:23:10] him in other words Jew Gentile Samarian
[1:23:16] Samar
[1:23:17] Samaritan cross doesn't matter
[1:23:20] god um is it there any those are all
[1:23:25] accepted of God the word which God sent
[1:23:27] unto the children of Israel preaching
[1:23:28] Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all
[1:23:31] that word I say you know which was
[1:23:33] published throughout all Judea and began
[1:23:35] From Galilee after the baptism of John
[1:23:38] preach everybody knew about Jesus in
[1:23:40] that area how God anointed Jesus of
[1:23:42] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:23:43] power who went about doing good and
[1:23:45] healing all that world pressed of the
[1:23:47] devil for God was with
[1:23:51] him and we Are Witnesses of all things
[1:23:54] which he did both in the land of the
[1:23:55] Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and
[1:23:57] hanged on a tree him God raised up the
[1:24:00] third day and showed him openly not to
[1:24:02] all the people but unto Witnesses chosen
[1:24:04] before of God even to us who did eat and
[1:24:07] drink with him after he rose from the
[1:24:09] dead and he commanded us to preach un
[1:24:11] the people so he continues to preach
[1:24:16] on for they heard
[1:24:19] okay excuse me for they heard them speak
[1:24:23] with tongues magnifying God then
[1:24:24] answered Peter can any man forbid water
[1:24:26] that these should not be baptized which
[1:24:28] have received the Holy Ghost as well as
[1:24:30] we and Comm he commanded them to be
[1:24:31] baptized in the name of the Lord then
[1:24:33] prayed then then prayed they him to ter
[1:24:36] certain days so the grace of God brings
[1:24:39] the message to a Roman Centurion and
[1:24:42] member of the known enemy another story
[1:24:45] in the book of Acts another example
[1:24:47] another remembrance of who what we are
[1:24:50] called to do as children of God is to
[1:24:53] follow God's calling follow God's will
[1:24:56] amen and keep in our hearts the
[1:25:00] remembrance of Grace to be reminded of
[1:25:03] these things to put your mind in
[1:25:05] remembrance of these things that the
[1:25:06] musicians want to come
[1:25:09] tonight amen do you remember Grace next
[1:25:12] time you feel a judgmental towards
[1:25:14] somebody who probably deserves it

[1:25:21] pointing back at me I needed to hear
[1:25:23] this tonight amen I mean God forgive me
[1:25:26] for the times I judge people because
[1:25:29] they're not lining up with the word of
[1:25:30] God right
[1:25:32] now but I needed
[1:25:34] Grace and they do too amen do I disagree
[1:25:38] with them yes will I follow them will I
[1:25:40] go along with them no CU it's contrary
[1:25:42] to the word of God but I'm not going to
[1:25:44] judge them I'm going to say Lord help
[1:25:47] them forgive them show them truth show
[1:25:50] them Revelation and give them Grace
[1:25:53] because I believe in my heart that they
[1:25:54] are still children of
[1:25:56] God whether or not their life at the
[1:25:59] point at this moment in time lines up
[1:26:01] with God's word I can't see their heart
[1:26:03] I can't see the future but God can Lord
[1:26:06] let me be in remembrance of Grace to
[1:26:10] extend to them H to them the love of God
[1:26:14] the love of Christ this this ties in
[1:26:17] very closely with last Wednesday
[1:26:18] Wednesday to be a light bearer to be a
[1:26:21] true bearer of the light you have to
[1:26:23] remember God's Grace you have to know
[1:26:26] that it was God's grace that put you
[1:26:28] where you are and it's God's grace that

[1:26:33] that fast everything can come crashing
[1:26:35] down around you we don't worry about

[1:29:14] into the Passover with your disciples
[1:29:16] over 2,000 years ago father Lord in a
[1:29:19] couple of days Lord Jesus you would be
[1:29:22] hung on the cross
[1:29:26] for our sins
[1:29:28] God if that ain't Grace I don't know
[1:29:31] what is amen we put you
[1:29:35] there our sins put you on the
[1:29:38] cross the devil would like us to to end
[1:29:41] the story
[1:29:43] there but as it seems to circulated
[1:29:46] every every year father that preacher
[1:29:49] said but Sunday's
[1:29:51] coming Lord and Sunday came and you you
[1:29:54] rose from the dead and with that
[1:29:56] Resurrection came a
[1:29:58] revelation father in our day Lord Jesus

[1:30:05] in the ground but Lord the full truth
[1:30:08] and revelation of who you are rose up in
[1:30:11] our day and now we have eyes that are
[1:30:13] open that can see the truth and Lord
[1:30:16] that is your
[1:30:19] grace oh God let us not be complacent
[1:30:22] let us not take that for granted but to
[1:30:25] eat up the book father we thank you Lord
[1:30:28] Jesus be with us now each one we pray in
[1:30:31] Jesus name amen amen every time you turn
[1:30:35] on the tape you're reminded of God's
[1:30:37] grace a revelation of everything that
[1:30:40] everyone wanted to know about but
[1:30:42] couldn't because it wasn't time yet you
[1:30:45] were given in your in your language for
[1:30:48] most of us in our
[1:30:50] language amen but God Will Make A Way

[1:31:22] God and there's it it's I don't have the
[1:31:26] words sometimes to describe when I'm
[1:31:28] thinking there's a direct correlation to
[1:31:32] men have who have gone through horrible
[1:31:36] things and received God's grace to their
[1:31:39] effective
[1:31:41] Effectiveness in the ministry whether

[1:31:58] actually in the time of John
[1:32:00] Wesley the the churches they they
[1:32:02] couldn't hold it in the churches every
[1:32:03] time he preached it just packed out
[1:32:06] because he had experienced a great
[1:32:09] measure of God's grace amen praise the
