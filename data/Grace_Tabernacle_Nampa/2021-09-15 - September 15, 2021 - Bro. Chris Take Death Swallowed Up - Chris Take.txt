let the preacher come out why are we staying tonight it's good to be in the house of god amen i love coming to church my body doesn't always but oh we have some sizing issues it's all right it doesn't have to be perfect i use a macbook and i use a slide presentation called keynote and the system here uses powerpoint so it doesn't always switch over correctly but that's okay oh i know why i use the font you don't have my apologies i'm gonna use that one again praise the lord let's turn in our bibles to first corinthians chapter 15. first corinthians chapter 15. pretty more we'll just read it and get the slide going here first corinthians chapter 15 verse 50. now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory amen o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory this thing of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be your steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord let's bow our heads tonight heavenly father lord jesus we're so thankful to be in your house tonight lord there's people who are at home watching tv doing other things lord but you called us to be your children and we are so thankful they can point and say we're bound by rules but father we are the most free people on the face of the earth because lord we have liberty in jesus christ father they're bound in sin they do what sin demands but father we do what you request of love lord jesus that's a relationship from our hearts father as well there are some of our brothers and sisters on the other parts of the world denied this privilege lord but here we still have it father we thank you for that lord and father we reach the holy spirit out to them lord that are gathered in hiding lord jesus in different parts of the world tonight lord or or they were last night depending on how far ahead they are lord may your holy spirit just guide them and lead them lord we commit them into your hands lord jesus we love you father we ask that you speak to our hearts tonight lord move aside the hindrances lord jesus and may you just calm down and speak to our hearts we're looking forward to hearing from you this evening in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated i mean lord add a blessing to the reading of his word um i could use a screen can i get a couple batteries aaa for the remote i should have checked it praise the lord so my uh screen doesn't want to touch either my title tonight is death swallowed up my subtitle is liberty in the 10th and why don't we turn the second corinthians chapter 3. so we take our text from that scripture we just read there first corinthians 15 54 death is swallowed up in victory second corinthians chapter three thank you second corinthians chapter three verse 14. but their minds were blinded i'll let you get there real quick but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil on taken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless now remember jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so it says moses here but that applies amen even in our day to the message because there's people who read the message and they come up with something different than what is the truth even though they're reading the same thing because there's a veil upon their heart verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord it your heart shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty praise the lord so death is swallowed up in victory oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory there we go the next slide there death is swallowed up in victory o death where is i sting o grave where is thy victory we read in second corinthians chapter 3 the veil that is done away with in christ so typing the make sure maybe not tonight just gonna have to do it for me won't touch either praise the lord the devil's just fighting it but we're just gonna roll with it and brother peterson says just ride the wave praise the lord so the veil is done away in christ and when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless can you do the slides for me nevertheless when it shall when it the heart shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away next slide where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen praise the lord so tonight we just ask the lord to speak to us and we just want to get out of the way for him amen so in the tabernacle in the word wilderness we have uh we read in exodus 39 verse 26 talking about how aaron had to be prepared to go into the tabernacle into the holiest of holies the high priest once a year he had to he had to dress a certain way and the scripture says a bell and a pomegranate a bell and a pomegranate round about the hymn of the robe to minister in as the lord commanded moses so he had to be dressed right and it next slide it was a bell pomegranate all the way around his his robe he had to be dressed right and he had to be walking right those two things combined amen were pleasing to christ it was a ma it was it could be tied to modest apparel amen saints uh men and women alike dressing modestly for god amen clothed in righteousness and then they step into the spiritual part where we become clothed in his righteousness our righteousness is but filthy rags amen our the clothing that we were born in this flesh is a filthy rag but god come down amen and has clothed us in the clothed us in the word a man so word clothing praise the lord so it was physical death if aaron to aaron if he didn't do it right you can go to the next slide so without the word cutting the word out in other words the word said what bell and a pomegranate bellow and a pomegranate and he'd had a walk and he had to sing and he had to do it just right and there was a rope tied to his foot if he didn't do it right and he was struck dead they would drag him out so without without the word him and it's spiritual death to not clothe yourself self in the word and walk according to the sounding of the word and that's next slide i can't it's gotta work okay so death amen eternal separation or no fellowship with god so it's spiritual death to not clothe yourself in the word amen dressed dressed right and walking right go hand in hand because if you're dressed in the word of god you'll walk in the word of god amen you can't be dressed in the clothes of the world amen or you're not going to walk according to the word of god and then but when you dress right and when you take god's word i don't get ahead of myself here we take god's word by faith aaron had to have faith that if he did it according to the word of god he would what overcome death amen we're going to get down to that i mean our title tonight it's death swallowed up amen so aaron applied the word so um without the word applied it's death eternal separation or no fellowship next slide but with the word applied next you can go to the next slide you can have liberty amen aaron applied the word and overcame death so that's the font there we lost the font but overcame death in the tent liberty in the tin was my subtitle death swallowed up and then liberty in the tent and so in the tent in the holiest of holies in this place that aaron went dressed in the word walking according to the word he overcame death death was swallowed up in his victory by applying the word to his life amen so victory overcoming death and then his obedience brought victory and swallowed death up in the liberty of christ and this was done in the tent the tabernacle in the wilderness and when i can tell you're thinking there's a question in your mind where's the direction that we're going just hang on we'll get there praise the lord so the unveiling of god brother brahm says in the unveiling of god 1964 and that's god he changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man then changed himself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man god acting in man what he really was jesus christ was god acting in man in a man in the man that's what he was he had changed from the pillar of fire what is he referring to as a pillar of fire the tabernacle in the wilderness the tent amen the pillar of fire would hover above the tit and it was the pillar of fire that was shrouding the mercy seat in the holiest of holies the place that aaron would go to and aaron was able to step into this holiest of holies step into the presence of god by applying god's word to his life amen and having victory over death amen and from that victory death swallowed up amen death in the natural amen swallowed up because he was applying the word that god had given him amen and because of that he brought liberty to the camp of israel because what was he doing back there once a year applying the blood applying the blood it is the application of the blood of jesus christ that gives us liberty amen as sons and daughters of god so he had changed from the pillar of fire and they had coming which was a veil in the wilderness that hid god from israel later on in this sermon brother the mountain says christ is always veiled what people fail to look for what people miss in down through the ages is they're looking at the wrong thing because christ is veiled amen god was veiled in moses god was veiled in the pillar of fire god was veiled in the holiest of holies and then god transformed in morphe amen in more phase the greek word transformed into the man jesus walking the shores of galilee and here we have the the religious leaders of the day the the message believers of the day amen who were not the seed of god that were mixed up in the crowd mixed up in the church and then failed to see jesus for who he was god in flesh because he was a veil behind something that stumbled them saints of god fits the paradox jesus will stumble unless you drink my blood and eat my body eat my flesh why couldn't if he just said no no it's wine it's bread why didn't he say that we have questions today where we say why didn't god just say it this way why didn't the prophet just say it this way in the message why isn't it just obvious in the bible this this this laid out as bullet points because god is stumbling amen jesus christ is stumbling what is that stumbling that's the veil that hides him from those not called to see it amen so we have become by god's gift of the holy spirit amen by his breaking that veil we have become amen he is now the high priest of our confession now we can step into the holiest of holies but i don't want to get ahead of myself which was a veil in the wilderness he said that hid god from israel moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hid all the time behind this pillar of fire which was the logos that went from god amen so this logos went from god amen and stepped down into the man jesus amen the veil in the wilderness held the victory behind the veil was the victory the victory that every man okay prisoner i got ahead of my slide so next slide there so this this unveiling of christ from the pillar of fire into jesus amen was victory for the bride amen so in the tabernacle in the wilderness you can go to the next one amen the victory that every man of israel was looking for was hidden inside the tent hidden in the holiest of holies amen they were searching they were looking next slide amen they were searching they were looking for that victory they were caught there was prophecies coming a virgin shall conceive something in their hearts was calling because adam started it at the beginning down through time and began to preach the gospel of christ coming back and restoring eden he began to talk about a time appointed so they were looking for the appointed time next slide um from from that was preached about from adam to joseph amen coming a time down through moses and all this going going down they were waiting looking for the unveiling of christ that would bring them liberty amen coming a liberty there was coming a liberty down in the and and through time and so they're here they're looking for this they're desiring for this victory hidden behind the veil in the tip only one man could access that and i was aaron but he was dressed and he was walking right but that was their victory amen they had no access to it until the tent moved from a physical tent next slide to a spiritual tent on the cross of calvary christ amen sacrificed himself the ultimate perfect sacrifice and brought us victory that brought us liberty in christ that we could now go that thing that they were looking for that thing that the patriarchs and the children of abraham were searching for were desiring for and then god brought to pass when he in morphing when he changed his veil to jesus amen to jesus christ now this is the spirit of christ moved into the body of christ what happened he changed tense he changed tense when he died on the cross death was swallowed up in victory but where is that victory he swallowed it up but how do you find that victory where is your liberty it's in the tent no we're not gonna find fly a plane and set up a tent i'm not preaching the tent doctrine see but why is that there it's a veil it stumbles so many people because he's talking about the spiritual tent amen there's liberty in your tent where is your victory found out there somewhere no it's found right down inside of your tent the human veil the word is still veiled today it's hidden behind a veil a human veil christ has skin on him amen he's got skin on him and this this is the bride age that's why they can't find him right they're looking for him in with the tapes they're looking for him with with with another another messenger they're looking for christ they're searching for him but what's happened is god failed in the bride of christ amen god has changed his veil and now he's hidden in you the bride of christ amen praise the lord natural death has been swallowed up in victory but as we get down to what i want to what what was on my heart to say tonight is that it's more than just natural death that has been swallowed up in victory it is more than than than the passing of a loved one that can cross over into the other side that has been swallowed up it is spiritual death that has been swallowed up in victory spiritual death amen so christ praise the lord in the world and the church is looking but they can't find him you have impersonations impersonations because the devil doesn't know what it is he can't figure it out because it's not it's hidden in the blood of jesus christ christ in his bride numbers 25 verse 1 to 12 you can turn to it if you like i have it here already and israel abode in shittim and the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab and they call the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people that eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself unto bel pure and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of of the people and hang them up before the lord against the son that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel and moses said unto the judges of israel stay ye slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baal pure and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianite woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation so you have israel now they committed a great sin with mohammed they failed they mixed the the true vine and the false vine mixed amen the bride and er well not the bride but the elect bride will not fall for that but the church it was it was it got mixed up it fell it fell in deception for that moabite spirit and here you have now uh 4 24 or 42 000 something like that we're slain and you have the people now there was a plague on israel is there a plague today on the church is there ever a plague today on the church and so now you have them weeping before the congregation weeping before the doors of the tabernacle of the congregation so they're at church they're repenting they're at the altar repenting and in steps a man with his midionitis wife a moabite taken in in improper to god's word he steps into the congregation bold a bold spirit of fornication trying to enter into the church it's a it's a bold spirit well all the spirits are getting bolder in the day that we live in a son of israel and the daughter of moab a man trying to mix the word of truth with organization he decided to take his organized religion to church he decided it was time to bring his idea of the marriage to church what are we doing every single day when we come to church we are we are in fellowship with our husband christ we are married to the word we are married to christ that's not coming amen that has happened because in order for us to step into glory to step into the rapture for that meeting in the air we have to be bearing the seed of christ in our lives so now we have a false representation of the marriage of the lamb stepping into church a spirit of fornication and that spirit brings death every single time it brought physical depth to the children of israel in this scripture and it will bring spiritual death to you today amen because god's word cannot mix with the false it will not mix with the false amen and the false will never bring forth life only christ can bring forth life israel was here weeping suffering from their sin how would you feel if you're at the altar repenting for your brothers repenting for all israel together and your brother walks in with this on his side in fornication standing in the midst of god of the tabernacle and then that's no different when somebody brings their organized religion idea into the mess into the church of god into the bride of christ amen standing before the door of the congregation they were weeping and repenting and the spirit of religion buried its head he thought you know what now's the time i'll step in and see if and they if they guess what in this scripture if they would have accepted it death would continue to reign in your in our day when that spirit steps into tries to step into your life or your church and you allow it to it will bring death to your life praise god it can be the word it doesn't have to be tape only it can be the worship of a man lift up a man amen a pastor or a minister up to higher than to a pedestal to worship him to to to to lift him up that will bring why because that's idolatry and that's the sin a man of of of witchcraft which is from the the harlot so brother branham says in the mark of the beast and the seal of god 1961 notice there was moab believed in the same god that israel believed in so it wasn't the baptist it wasn't the pentecostals it wasn't a church of christ it wasn't rock church it was the message it was the message for it was what another illegitimate wrong wife large child by his daughter just exactly like the unborn churches today the church natural is a church of the world committing spiritual fornication with the world and not living true to god he says a very beautiful time he says in another place in the same message notice he was just as fundamental as israel was talking about balaam he built seven altars seven sacrifices seven rams just exactly like they were doing doing down in the camp of israel what does the scripture say so close it with the seed the very left if it was possible this seems to be the theme lately and uh i always pay attention when there's a thing because god is trying to tell this bride something and then i like to listen to tapes and i'll mix it up at work and we'll watch you know brother tim pruitt or donny or brother jewel he's kind of around and tonight i was watching with him and he was preaching my notes and it's just crazy to see what god's doing praise the lord i don't know where that came from just the same sacrifice he says but what balaam failed to see was that smitten rock that brass serpent the shout of the camp of the king he failed to see that pillar of fire going before them christ was veiled balaam failed to see all he saw was the seven sacrifices all he saw was was was it was these you know these tapes and these things here we'll lay this out and you know we'll have the cross and we'll have the picture of huffman's head of christ and we'll have the picture of the prophet and we'll set it all out so it just looks so nice that's what it is today you say you belong to the pentecostals they're a bunch of holy rollers he says they used to be but they're not no more but so they belong to them but they failed to see that pillar of fire now so they can be sure to see it we got a picture of it scientifically proved amen yes they failed to see the pillar of fire the shout of the camp that there's a king among us king jesus they failed to see it he failed to see that blood atonement amen that's what happened when balaam looked and said and said i see the backside of israel but when he when he began to to try to prophesy god took over and began to bless israel why because god looks upon his bride amen through the eyes of grace through the blood of jesus christ amen because death has been swallowed up in victory what is that victory the revelation of jesus christ to you today amen that is the victory that you have and that going to swallow up the death of organized religion swallow up the death of indifference swallow up the death of iniquity amen there ain't no grave that's gonna keep this body down amen and that's inside your life spiritually speaking amen praise the glory meant death swallowed up so balaam failed to see christ he failed to see christ that's the problem with the shock that's your hint that's the problem with the shuck the shuck and the seed the difference is the shuck kind of looks like it has the sacrifices you know fill in the blanks everything else i i just i'm not preaching against people i i try not to keep talking about the tapes only things i don't want anybody to think i'm trying to you know defend god's gospel he does that himself i'm not trying to attack anybody but it's the spirit of the age that we're living in and god is addressing it it's not written in my notes and then god is addressing it and then so now we have the shuck and the seed we have deception in the camp of israel why because israel when they when they went to the feast of bel pior that it was the shock looked pretty good it looked really good hey as far as i'm gonna turn it's the real thing it looks like the real thing so close so close but it's not possible because the next slide if you keep reading the scripture there was a man god always has a man you can go to the next slide this is messed up but now when phineas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw he rosa we're continuing in in verse seven thank you he saw he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand and then he took the word that double-edged sword what is the word to sin a weapon what is the word of god it's a weapon so he took a javelin in his hand and then he took the word in his hand brother bennett preached that message what is in your hand little david amen what's in your hand bride of christ what do you have in your hand you have the word of god you say oh my goodness it's so closely to see the very elect and it looks just like the real thing how can we even make it why even try take the word take up the word amen when there's a when there's a a spirit of fornication a spirit of of idolatry of the organization of man trying to come into your life amen or even anything contrary to the word of god take up the word amen and so he goes on to say he said then he went after the man of israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand and the lord speak unto moses saying phineas the son of eliezer the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that i consumed not excuse me the children of israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace when you take the word in your hand how does it how can you take the word by faith faith gives you the ability to pick up the javelin next slide faith just keep going produces he gone action which produces victory it takes faith in god's word phineas had faith that god's word was true go and slay all of the sin from israel so he goes because he has faith that it's true and he picks up the javelin amen that faith faith produced the confidence infineous to pick up the word of god and take it into action amen and in that action you say oh such a horrible thing but that action brought victory for israel it stayed the plague and every time you take the word of god in faith and act upon it it will bring victory to your camp it will bring victory to your life it will bring victory to your family and it will bring the ultimate victory to the bride of jesus christ praise the lord god gave phineas a covenant of peace in recognition of his faith in the word there was another covenant given amen a covenant given to abraham amen because abraham took action on god's word that's why he says people get confused and that scripture be still and know that i am god amen to be still means to not worry he still needs me means to have faith to stand solid on god's word amen and act upon his word it's not to sit down and give up the fight what if phineas didn't take up the word and go and act upon it the plague would have continued and then you've been given a covenant of peace there in that tent phineas brought victory to israel over death death was consuming the camp of israel but phineas amen went and took the word into the tent funny how things aren't in scripture for no reason at all amen in the tent is where he took the word amen and defeated death he defeated death for the camp of israel praise the lord amen we'll read another example and this one i love um you can go to the next uh slide there my covenant of peace we'll have to just do this one again in a few months when the slides are working i'm just kidding they're doing a great job thanks guys judges chapter 4 verse 17. now how be it caesarea sacra fled away on his feet to the tent of jail the wife of heber the canine for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of hebrew the king knight and jail went out to meet caesar and said unto him turn in my lord turn into me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle so this is the the battle of barack and deborah against syria i think the enemy she covered him with the man and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man hath come and inquire of thee and say is there any man here thou shalt say no in jail hebrews wife took a nail of the tent and took a hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died isn't it crazy the devil will come into your tent and tell you what to do see there was a treaty between the family of jail and the enemy next slide peace there was peace between jail's family and the enemy you can't make peace with the devil there's always strings attached always and you you wonder you know there's a province that if barack didn't go by himself if he took deborah then the victory was going to be given into the hands of a woman that was the prophecy that went forth and i was sitting and i was studying this and i was thinking why why a woman you know why a woman and i begin to realize what's the loveliest lady that we know of the bride of christ jail was a type of the bride of christ you see the devil had come knocking for the last time he says hey hey heidi we have a treaty right we have peace yeah but that peace never said you can come into my tent and tell me what to do sorry there's a hidden clause well i have a response from jail to the devil in every treaty you make in your life with the devil or what you made at one point in time you have a hidden clause little asterisks down at the bottom tiny fine print that says paid in full knowledgeable at any time voidable at any time because jesus christ amen oh i'm gonna jump off the platform jesus christ nullified your contract with the devil amen there is no way for it to stand why because it's blood for blood that's the contract blood for blood and christ gave his blood and cut that tree that you have with the devil so now jail she says enough is enough he comes into my tent and then you got to get mad at the devil saints of god you got to get upset that he's messing with your family you've got to get upset he's messing with your church you got to say enough is enough why didn't she just take a uh the hammer and mash his head and why a steak why a steak because saying say god you gotta drive a steak down you gotta say at this point in this time i am putting my steak down into the rock of jesus christ amen in the devil that treaty is no more amen you can't come into my tent anymore and tell me what to do you can't tell come into my tent and have me feed you milk and take care of you and put a mantle upon you i've allowed it for too long and then i'm cutting the contract every praise the lord so she took that stake she drove it into his head the lovely lady of the word she's got power behind her oh she's nice looking on the outside but don't cross her she's got the power of christ to back her every move up amen he thought he had the victory in the garden of eden when he seduced eve amen he thought he had the victory and then when he took um took down each ever and every man that went down into the grave he thought he had the victory over the camp of israel but god always has a man amen god just needs one person an individual who is willing to surrender completely to him amen that he can take them and then drive the stake into the head of the enemy and it doesn't say that's not that doesn't it doesn't in there she says he she fastened it to the ground she went through his head and then she kept on going just enough is enough not ever again amen determination to take god's word what did she do she took faith in god's word and put it to action and in her tent and then she found liberty from in in christ they meant death was swallowed up death you say she was alive yes but she swallowed up the spiritual death that was in her family amen praise the lord from this day forward no more satan it is finished amen will not play church anymore we'll drive that stake and we'll fasten it to the ground you got to show him that you mean business you got to show god that you mean business amen fasten the snake steak to the ground amen that bride rose up through every age down through time and satan would come sauntering in say i'll handle this one again i'll take care of this so he killed 68 million of them going to the church age book with the youth group right now we just went through the via tyrone church age one of the darkest stages 68 million protestants martyred for christ see satan thought he had the victory but then the seed put forth the bud in the ground amen lord willing next time amen could almost be a part two i'm trying not to go into that the next one the next sermon praise god that seed put forth amen what was what was what was giving that seed life was the logos very hovering over that sea praise the lord but in that secret place in her tent the bride had gotten something that satan will never know you see abraham and sarah received a promise sarah was burned she couldn't have kids they received the promise that they would have a son year went by five years 10 years 20 years 25 years no promise yet no fulfillment of that promise but one day the promise swallowed up death in their tent and god brought forth the promised son the same things happened in your life god called you aside he took you in the tent amen and his victory swallowed up death in your life and then um the unveiling of god 1964. moses come down and and said you might not believe this maybe but god appeared to be in the pillar of fire and he told me these things it's not going to ferrel oh we have all kind of things like going on pharaoh said why pastor farrell said well you got a cheap magician trick well i got a magician's here that can turn a serpent into a stick into a serpent come here magicians and they come over and done the same thing moses knowed no nothing bothered him how many impersonators they had didn't make a bit of difference moses just stood still the first thing you know they crawled around a while and directly moses says snake just eat the rest of them up death swallowed up see why like them apostles they couldn't explain it moses didn't know how god was going to do but he was going to do it remember he said jamers and janice will return in the last days see impersonations and would deceive the very elect if possible matthew 24 24 see just exactly the same things do the same kind of miracles and everything so you could say you can look at this this quote here you could say oh when janice and jamboree's they're here today we can we can acknowledge that impersonators are here today you can say oh they're gonna they're gonna do the same trick well look at the other part of the scripture those two snakes were swallowed up by the truth see oh oh they're impersonating it how will we know watch for the truth to swallow up death the man uh excuse me do the same kind of miracles watch the word see watch the word don't watch what someone else is saying don't watch with someone else watch the word of god the man says he does a miracle and still wants to believe that there is three gods and there is all these kind you get away from that kind of i say today there's a man says he does a miracle and he still wants to believe contrary to the scripture doesn't matter what that is he can be preaching almost the truth but if there's one thing in his life that doesn't line up with that word of god amen there's death in the camp that's wrong see no such thing see the word every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god genesis one word why did he say genesis because eve in the garden of eden one word changed it over here said don't take or add one word see it's got to be that same word see amen so truth will swallow death up amen truth will set you free amen there are impersonations now there are doctrines and ideas that would deceive the very elect if possible but do not but do not fear amen the truth will swallow death up every single time amen you praise the lord it doesn't matter what it is doesn't matter how close he looks to the real thing and then you watch the word he says watch the word and death will swallow up amen and when and that victory that swallows death up is the same victory that gives you liberty in your tent in your body in your life and then you can have the victory over whatever magician tricks the devil throws at you amen you can have the victory amen someone was speaking the other day they were talking about the the gibeonites that came to joshua and they had stale bread and they had you know threaded their um ripped their clothes up and put dust on themselves like they had a long journey and they and it was only three days in reality and they tricked joseph uh joshua and the reason they tricked joshua is because joshua didn't go back to the word directly for every little thing says god you've got to go back to the word keep a pulse on the word of god keep a pulse you know what that means you're constantly watching is is this according to god's word is this according to god's will amen every step every conversation that you have especially now in in the day that we live in some some of us family caught up in in in uh you know that that's uh antichrist spirit and then they want to just you know want to try to bring you down they want to try to talk to you and they want to try to try to just fill your head with nonsense you got to even pray you know should you answer the phone right now or if you should what what should you say amen every little thing why god wants a wife who's completely dependent upon him i mean i don't want i don't want my wife to be all independent because then she don't need me but see the thing of it is the bride of christ has to have christ or we just fall apart we just fall apart we have to be fully and completely dependent upon christ if we want to have victory why because christ is the victory that has swallowed up death amen the the doubts that arise in your life you know i was i was going to preach one time and i maybe i've shared this testimony if i have forgive me but i was going to preach one time for a brother andrew boy scout out in chief act and i was in the office and and all of the sudden this spirit of doubt came down into the room that to tell me that that this whole thing is nothing but a man's idea and brother branham and all this stuff and maybe everybody's right and i i couldn't believe it it was such a strong presence of that spirit and i was like man i'm fixing to go out there and preach you see even though those thoughts were going through my head my heart was testifying contrary my heart was saying no i don't believe that i don't accept that but i was still battling that and you understand if any um all of you have been through battles you understand what i'm talking about your heart is crying out against that and so i i was just uh kind of taken blindsided and i began to sometimes i don't know some people maybe say it's adhd i have to fidget constantly so sometimes when i pray i pace and it helps me focus and so i just started to pace the office and i began to pray and i thought you know what and something count over me what it was it was it was the victory of christ began to stand and testify and then the atonement stood and testified and he began to speak and i began to say all right satan if it's not the truth what about this and if this isn't the truth what about this victory and if this isn't the truth what about this healing and if this isn't the truth what about this scripture and what about the manifestation of this in my own life and this person's life and that person's life and i begin to testify of what the works of christ i begin to testify of the victory that overcame death i began to testify of the anointing the holy spirit that now was standing veil in the bride of christ and you know what that spirit left and the presence of god came down and i and i went in and it was gone from me why because he can't stand against the word of god by faith see i had faith in my heart was it of myself absolutely not god put the faith within me to stand and testify and i began to when i began to testify what was that it was the faith in my heart by god's grace taking the word in hand amen and bringing victory to my tent amen that was just a and then you say well why would not allow that i am without any guile or frustration i'm gonna say i'm tired of hearing people say why would god do that why do you do what you do stop asking that question you don't know it just accept like don't ask why i ask how don't ask why ask how you can serve god as you know okay so not instead why did why did why did this happen in your life you know listen to the testimony of what god brought them through you say that that brother um tim prone in his church they had a had to fight that spirit when sister karen passed away oh people say oh well she didn't get healed she got healed better than she could on this side of heaven on this side of glory she got she got a better healing that she could ever receive on this side of glory but see that the scoffer wants to rise up and say oh but she passed on and the scarf wants to rise up and say all these things but guess what just take it back to the word because what the bible doesn't say you know you swallowed up death right i need that scripture real quick here first corinthians amen the bible testifies of christ said that death is swallowed up in victory but guess what you swallow up death every day of your life because god has anointed you christ is in your life veiled to the world behind you hey my sister if you want to come tonight we're going to wrap this up amen death is swallowed up amen physical natural death is swallowed up in victory amen but spiritual death is swallowed up in victory don't ever put a period on the end of someone's life you never know what god's going to do when i have friends and i have loved ones amen caught up in that and you can't put a period on the end of their life you do not know what god's going to do amen but you and this is something that the lord is dealing with with with me and my wife on and by god's grace you know we we uh we got it i guess you could say not perfect i'm not saying that but the lord is teaching us something and we picked it up and we took it to heart and god miraculously changed the situation that we had in our lives miraculously someone in a relationship i had with someone that was broken for years never heard from them never got a phone call never got a text they just we god dealt with our heart and begin to deal with us you know let's make sure we have no bitterness on our side for when god brings them out we're prepared to accept it you don't want to build a business because it's not against that person it's against the spirit right we don't want to get wrestle against flesh and blood but against the principalities and the power of the air so if you have a loved one that's caught up in in something false doctrine or or the you know anti-message thing you want to make sure your heart is conditioned right so that when they find their liberty you can accept them and there's a relationship there that that they can step into because they're going to need that that us that that that love there of christ and it also if if you keep yourself open to god to let god use you to have a soft heart then he can speak through you but if you're coiled up in bitterness then he can't speak through and so we were taking little things all out of context and god began to deal with our hearts and he changed our uh perception of the situation you begin to look at ourselves and say you know what i'm not going to accept that i'm not going to start to talk about that because that's not edifying that's not what god would want me to be saying and we begin to just leave that stuff alone and out of the blue person texted me first time in years out of the blue see god was just waiting for us to get out of the way man we'll see what god will do we're waiting on on a full and complete manifestation but um it's the first step in the right direction because we got ourselves out of the way and that's the biggest thing that god if you want to god to take you and use you and allow you to be phineas and take up the word and take action and you have to have a heart that's completely surrendered to him when you can't have nothing in the way praise the lord why don't we stand tonight embarrassed by our heads heavenly father lord jesus i pray that lord something was said tonight about jesus not by myself but i'll have notes and i'll say certain things and then i'll hear testimonies it's not even what i thought i heard but god because you took it you put it to your use but i don't want to be i don't wanna i don't want personal gain i don't want anything i just we just want you to take the words that were spoken tonight and launch them deep within our hearts god lord we love you and father we're so thankful that lord you understand when we have hard difficult conversations with loved ones
