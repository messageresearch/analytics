send me amen let that be from our hearts real heart desire amen amen so good to see each and every one of you Amen brother vasili that nowhere might find you this morning but God bless you I have to greet you hug your neck after service amen so good to have brother Peter sister Elena with us visiting family such a lovely young couple Amen brother mellow God bless you you and your family that is so good to see you here let's just give a little Hand of Welcome to brother mellow and his family let us say God bless you amen foreign [Music] s just have to deal with greater adjustments but his grace is sufficient for us and we say thank you Lord no matter what the circumstance is that he has made us we often think about just spiritual things but he has made us more than able and Conquer of all things amen natural and spiritual and so we're just so happy to have that and brother Trevor sister Kerry feeling better Amanda is talking to Sister carry on the phone days ago and first of the week and um almost sounded like maybe Lazarus voice a voice had been raised from the dead and uh just she she just sounded so so rough but praise God she's here today and uh of course we're always happy to see our sister April amen and uh glad that the schedule's coming we're praying that the schedule just always falls in her favor uh you know that's what we we just desire and uh you know there's just our brother Justin him and his family his siblings and his mother was here last Sunday and just lift them up in prayer that um the schedule would start to fall in their favor Amen in this world we live in how Satan has come we'll tie that a little bit in today's thought Satan has turned this into a 24 7 world and he didn't do that for our convenience he did that to draw us away from the things of God and he's willing to turn a whole economy into what they call thriving 24 7 but it really was just a ploy of Satan to keep people out of the house of God to keep them from having the time to read their Bibles and to sit down and and interact with their family devotions Etc and uh but by God's grace amen do you believe we have God's favor amen so God's favor on us will be greater than anything Satan can ever use to pull us away and I say Amen to that amen and we want to today I know brother Adam will probably frown at me but amen many years ago he met this beautiful girl and he just couldn't help himself and today we're going to be talking about courtship and uh you know how many years [Music] 23 years amen thank you Lord for 23 years amen one beautiful daughter and two handsome Sons I say it's been a blessed time amen and uh sister Alice I know you have a lot of Grace you'll also forgive me amen but we want to draw attention once again our sister Alice and I apologize for not being there yesterday but um graduate of high school with more credits than I thought imaginable why you hadn't time to me high school took every moment just to get ABC and uh sister Alice has got all kinds of other certifications and things added on it I want to give praise not to Sister Alice but to the grace of our God today that he give her the fortitude the desire and ability to accomplish so much in such a short time amen God bless you Sister Alice I love you amen hallelujah thank you and uh Memorial Day why we are not a church filled full of many veterans but Memorial Day is certainly a day that we look to and realize that as a nation much sacrifice has been given for us to stand here with this freedom but I give even more in Memorial Day to those Sons and Daughters of God the Saints of the ages gone by that gave their lives for this gospel not only in the physical their blood being shed but they they walked and become uh vagrant she might say of the deserts and the byways to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we say thank you today Lord for the natural Veterans of of our nation and Nations I should say but definitely for those Sons and Daughters of God who have stood and proven and I just give this as a little Accolade or brother bobman sister Joanne I know their heart they would love to be here this morning but here my brother and sister is a paradox of life when we first get saved the struggle we have to fully surrender and trust God and we live through you might say the better parts of our years and then when we get old God brings us right back that we have to be in a position of trust again amen so if we think it's going to become easier my brother and sister well fortify yourself that no matter what is in your future you stand that test and I always just think of our brother Bob sister Joanne so faithful so full of Fire and Life amen God bless them today communion will be this next Sunday uh 5 PM amen if we turn in our Bibles I want to speak to you once again thank you musicians thank you brother Alex I want to speak to you once again on things that are to be now we look at this my brother and sister in such a broad topic the things that has been promised in the word of God that is coming now you know I was just in my studies just looking at a couple little things you know and it's amazing the Paradox of it all now we know that the world has told us that we should judge ourselves lest we should be judged so if we'll take the time to judge ourselves by the word amen then we can stand with confidence and boldness in this day but we'll look over on this side over here there's a side that says don't judge me at all and there's a side that comes over here and says you know what it don't matter how you live you're all going to get judged and it's all going to be this way and it's all going to be that way but I tell you my brother mother and sister that I like the balance that has been given or brought to us and that is that we can stand in the word today doing our very best now those of us that are perfect and without mistakes should probably go home enjoy a little nap because there's none but we have boldness Can someone say I have boldness amen because we have the word amen and if God is judging how brother Brandon put it if God is judging by the word and the word is in us we have no problem amen so what we want to do is make sure this is in US amen because if this is not in us then we have problems but we should be at a place spiritually mature enough to realize that we are walking and talking living Epistles red of all men and God has never get this now God has never written a false epistle himself man has Satan house but God has not Lord let me be a written epistle Amen Let the word be written on the table of my heart that I can just live it out not to impress you not to impress them but just simply because we love the Lord amen let's turn in our Bibles once again to the elect lady second John 1. one through eight and I hope you don't mind because this will be a thought that is so strong with me that it's like job on the ash Heap we might be visiting this elect lady talking about her visiting with her getting some advice from her amen the word says the spirit and the bride say come so this elect lady's got a voice She's Not Just expected to be quiet and set in the corner but she actually has a voice amen the Elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth Can someone say amen and thank you Lord for the true sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in truth and love I Rejoice greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth now some people would be confused and believe it's the natural children and we'll claim them also but this is spiritual children right amen as it is in the time that God never changes his word but he has full authority to add or continue the explanation of the word so he doesn't have to he said let there be light he didn't have to you know make sure that included photosynthesis and vitamin D and all these other things that was all just added in as part of this so if we're walking in light my brother and sister the word of God will be bringing life to us we don't have to then go down the list saying and this and this and this and this you know you say well if you have the Holy Ghost or if you this or if you that no my brother and sister to the elect lady walking in light includes every drop of that amen so we don't have to have a great explanation and great big books and indexes and references and all of this to do it if we identify as being the elect lady everything promised to her connected to her an addendum to her is yours amen thank you Lord I founded thy children walking a truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but not which we had from the beginning that we love one another hmm he didn't say it was about our Doctrine did he but the elect lady will have correct Doctrine and he didn't directly say it was about her spirit but she will have the right spirit but we love one another and this is love that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that as you have heard in the from the beginning that she should walk in it for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus has come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist look to yourselves now you see if we are going to take this as a carnal message many people are saying well this is only about the prophet it's only about these preachers it's only about certain places have you know the revealed truth my brother and sister here it's telling us to look to ourselves in other words examine ourselves if someone far away doesn't think you're a Christian are you going to stop because of their opinion no there's only one opinion that matters and that is our Lord Jesus Christ um look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but not which we but that we receive a full reward amen heavenly father just asks you lord to bless this time together with the Saints have joined together today May our licks of fire father turn into a bonfire today may it be a wild fire father not an emotion not in physical uh outpourings father but let our souls just be on fire burning for you today may we not walk out of the house of God today Father with a fear and anxiety a question mark but may we stand strong on the word knowing that you called us to walk in truth father so the answer for our lives lies in the truth we say thank you Lord and ask for your blessing today in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now as we look at verse 8 real quick this is just a little something I want to just throw in as a little example no I'm not throwing sister Jerry under the boss some of you might interpret it that way but you know um we drove Jolene and Alia to the airport and somewhere along the line sister Jerry says I don't know where my purse is at and so she's like it could be here it could be there uh it could be uh you know in jolene's car because she had driven it it might be and she zeroed in and finally she says I'm pretty sure I left it in the office and so when we got home from Boise we just drove over there and sure enough it's laying there by her workstation in the Farm office and my brother and sister it is and I bring that as an example because if we're not careful there's literal things in our lives that we have laid to the side that God does not desire for us to lay to the sign and over time days weeks months years we kind of have forgot about those things and you know it's interesting maybe you might be cleaning up some stuff you got a revelation that you're not supposed to be the hoarder and you're cleaning up stuff and and suddenly you find something and you're like wow so that's where that that's where that's been and you look at the stuff that's around it and realize you have missed it but not missed it for 10 12 15 years now those of you have moved amen we all only move down the block I should say sister Jerry Only moves us down the block she won't move us any further amen she doesn't do pianos she doesn't do refrigerators but she gets almost everything else now if you're not careful you'll put something in there and you know that you had that I hope you're following me you know that you had that but you really cannot identify where you left it and that is exactly what the devil is trying to do to the bride of Christ today that we lay things down they were important to us at one time but over time because we don't know where we left it and we're not entirely sure when we left it then it slowly fades in value to us and when it gets far enough away from us it becomes only a vague memory reminds me of an individual that I was dealing with in another country and they were talking about how that they had slipped away from serving the lord and that uh they they really down in their heart they really wanted to serve God but it had been so long and I literally asked him I said so how when you're talking about it's been so long how long has it been since you read your Bible oh something of the nature of four or five years how long has it been since you prayed an Earnest prayer before God may be something on the order of five or six years and their expression was I really want that relationship back I really want to do that and to me my brother and sister it's often easier to say than to do but I just told them if you want the relationship back if you want what you had at that time in your life then go find it and pick it back up but in the case of a prayer life or reading your Bible you don't have to go through the boxes and totes of your junk you can just stop and throw the other junk out and go back to it and that's what Satan tries to do he tries to get so much stuff into our life amen I have to say Amen to this I'm preaching to myself you just get so busy you get so much in your life now we forget what we laid down or where we laid it down or when we laid it down but that is not what God desires amen and now we're looking here as we look at this the scripture John is speaking to the elect lady and so it's there in this love affair that John actually had with the bride of Christ he has this love affair because he knows what the word is he knows what the word produces it does not go a generation and die the word reproduces itself it is not that we have children and because they're born in the message that they automatically are saved but my brother and sister this word that is the promise for our age will reproduce itself God does not have grandchildren but God has a word that brings life to every generation Can someone say Amen to that so we don't have to worry about where Christianity is going we see where it's going in the world around us it's fading away but that's because there's a key element that is missing and that is truth and so wherever truth is it Sparks a fire that brings hearts and souls with a desire to serve God Amen and you know we look at this that God is Desiring here uh in this word for us to recognize amen that we have received from him amen now it was not as it is some people have struggles with this but it is not that we received it from the preacher we didn't receive it from the prophet it comes from God himself amen and I say thank you Lord because there's times my brother and sister that men will fail us there's times that men's words they'll stumble over them and there's trouble but this reproduction as it were now my brother and sister there is something so unique that this word of God as it is this elect lady there's a relationship that is uh taking place now I hope you can follow me as I make this jump it's going to save you all sitting here for another hour if I make this jump now some men give roses and some men give chocolates and those are beautiful things sisters can you say Amen but God has given us truth do you want roses do you want chocolate or do you want the truth my brother and sister you see that's what sets this elect lady away from all the rest that is that they have a love for the truth amen amen many blessings can you interact with me today please have many blessings come our way in this natural life we have been blessed beyond measure amen but I would have to say today that the greatest gift that has been given to you and I is truth amen it is the greatest gift we might pass from this life with a disease in her body uh we might pass from this life as her brother Neil with his legs gone and and parts of his hands fingers gone past from this life but my brother and sister I know the brother personally and when he passes from this life he will pass from this life with truth amen legs hands all of that will not do nothing beyond the Divine but the truth is our passage into the presence of almighty God I plan on standing at that Throne I stand on plan on being there at the marriage supper of the Lamb there's nothing on this Earth that will get me there or get you there but truth and so that's why we as elect lady are reclaiming that this morning as elect lady we should be seeking pursuing Longing For Crying Out Lord I need truth whatever I must go mountains and valleys and deserts and whatever fountains as it were Lord I have to have truth because my desire my brother and sister if our desire is just to go to church there's a lot finer ones in the community we don't even have a baseball team we don't even have a gymnasium but if we want to make a rapture what are we going to do find truth we are going to hunt up truth and we are going to pursue truth with everything that is within us amen and you look at this my brother and sister all these others will pass away you know it's just uh beautiful you know you can have a rose you can put it in a vase uh you can even go down to the floral shop or wherever and buy certain additives to pour in the water that extend the life of the flower But ultimately when that flower was cut off its days were numbered but my brother and sister the word of God chose you and I that when we were planted in Jesus Christ Our days were no longer numbered amen our days are eternity our days are the days of Christ amen for we were with him before there ever was a world Amen and we will be with him when this world has been burnt over and restored as a kingdom for God and so it's there that we'll look at this in this fashion and as we believe these things we do don't we amen that we'll realize all the rest of this passes away amen the scripture says Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word praise the Lord the word will not pass away let me be anchored in the word Lord let me be anchored in that life that comes out of the word you know my brother and sister if you get close enough to this bloody lamb the blood gets on you if you don't get very close to it you'll say what is the blood where is the blood where's the effect of the blood you've got to get close to the lamb that was slain for the blood to get on you we want someone to come and carry the blood to us but my brother and sister that isn't what it was when they went into the tabernacle into the temple they had to stand there as the priest took the life of the turtle dove or of the lamb and the blood had to get on them it wasn't about I made a sacrifice what was the sacrifice well I wanted to do this but I didn't that's not a sacrifice let someone else carry that let somebody else get dirty with the business of God no I say let us be willing we got a blood that washes us from all sin cleanses Us in all circumstance even to the hymn of our garment don't be afraid to get dirty in God's business don't be afraid to get the blood on you don't be afraid to get everything that God has on you amen he's the washer of the Soul he's a cleanser of the flesh he's the one that gives a sound mind amen I might have the quote here I actually right now at this moment don't remember whether I included it or not it's quite lengthy did you guys bring a lunch okay I hope you're not too hungry when you leave you see the truth will never pass away now God having made the natural and the spiritual and parallel lines biblical courtship young people please listen for just a moment biblical courtship is not a form of entertainment she's cute I'll take her for ice cream oh turns out cute and cranky are all under the Seas done with her I'm going to go over here you know what this one's sweet but sweet and sulfur are also under the S's and sometimes sweetness Burns I'll just go over here I went through all the young ladies in our church I will we'll start checking them out over here at this church and that and and I want to go to youth camp so I can expand my list of young ladies no my brother and sister that's Entertainment the parallel that God has given between biblical courtship natural and spiritual is that we should enter into it seriously with an intent to build a lifelong relationship amen natural cording is turned into a sport Even in our message churches I wish to God some people would have courage enough to say young man not again you're not adding another girl to your list of girlfriends but you realize let's go to the spiritual side here so many people have taken this as entertainment they're heady they're high-minded they're lovers of pleasure and if we get this in our mind thinking because they're lovers of pleasure they're going to be out on a Sunday morning on the on their you know quad out in the mountains they're going to be in their boat at the lake they're going to be down at the cinema no my brother and sisters some people Anointed with that Spirit come into the house of God the scripture says to have their ears tickled it's become an entertainment to them oh weren't the song So Special wasn't this so nice did you see their new dress I actually have one in the closet I'm just afraid for the husband to see it oh and look at oh my brother and sister that they're being entertained in a religious way they're being entertained and it does something for them in their soul that they feel like everything is more or less okay but you see this should be a courtship of a lifelong relationship something that would stand the test of time something that would come and build it my brother and sisters the spiritual move I want to say today Lord help me to make everything that I do not be just convenient or make me feel good but let it be a spiritual move in my life I'm not moving down the ladder I'm moving up the ladder hey man I'm not moving away from Christ I'm moving into Christ amen because without that move my brother and sister this Satan will come and he come and he infiltrates this my brother and sister you can look at this and I'm just breezing over the top of this in one sense today but you see God is uh wooing the elect lady any of you been wooed lately Hallelujah the elect lady is being wooed by the Holy Ghost she is being pulled into the presence of God he speaks to her Midnight Hour he's whispering to her heart and soul in a moment of anxiety he's there to say it's all right sweetheart calm down I've got it all in control but I don't see the answer Lord don't worry about it I promise the answer is already on the way and then this little lady can settle down and say my husband is in control amen oh reminds me of a story once this man was in a parking lot of a store and he's accosting and kind of semi-assaulting people and this man yells at her run run this man is crazy run but she saw her husband coming across the parking lot and she stood her ground she even stood boldly and said no problem my husband's got the answer and he's on the way and the man was just a few steps away and this man starts towards his wife and he takes and man handles him in such a fashion that when the police come they called an ambulance also my brother and sister the ambulance we're calling is not a natural ambulance it is God having pity on the devil being you say brother Paul he's having pity on the devil yes because God already the course of what Satan has to do before he is finished you say why does God keep the devil on life support because he's got to do some things before it's all over amen Heather wise the power that God has endude in you as Sons and Daughters of God you could literally bind Satan and him not be loosed except for the word says otherwise amen oh some of us look at that and we nod our heads like what are you talking about my brother and sister it's the word of God it's a word of God Amen whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and if we did not have a word of God that gives Satan a leeway to finish his work then the bride of Christ would bind Satan and he would no longer be effective many of you's faith is little enough that you would say I don't believe what you're saying right now well I'm telling you don't doubt me go find what the word says and when you find that the word says that you actually have the ability to bind Satan in that form then maybe you'll catch the revelation of it but you know what the problem is now forgive me I'm speaking a little strong the problem is is we don't want the church to live any higher than our own personal revelation and faith in the word oh what are you talking about you can do this what about you'll God answer this what about you spoke this oh that can't be such don't bind me with your unbelief don't bind me with your lack of faith don't remind me of the revelation of the word of God that Revelation is a true Revelation instead of sitting there on the ground wondering what's going to happen and how did that eagle get on the post why don't you see if you're an eagle maybe you heard the same voice but you don't believe it stop and say Lord help me I heard that word Lord but I I I've never been on the post in my life I've never been on top of the fence I've never gone on the peak of the barn I've never looked in the heavenlies to soar well what are you doing what are you doing you're an eagle and I'll tell you what I hope this doesn't offend anybody but so many times Eagles are walking with chickens and they see a check and stop and focus Peck at something and the Eagles walking in chicken footsteps in a chicken fashion and he stops he's looking at what did this eat what's he feeding on I mean I'm a chicken just like he is but I can't feed on what he's fine because you know while I got better eyesight and then my great great great great great great great great great great relation in creation well that's about as close as the chicken gets to an eagle it's just a relation and creation both say they were created can't feed on that amen but you ever get an eagle and he sees some meat you imagine brother Brown's story about the eagle in the chicken yard now forgive me Saints I just flew way off the rails do you ever wonder if he didn't stop and look at some of his great relations and Creations and think what does he taste like eagles eat chickens huh I mean even down in the chicken you already had trials he has struggles he's like you know what I like to do I'd like to just anyway why am I thinking in the thoughts not supposed to be thinking about sinking my claws in I mean my yeah anyway talons yeah anyway excuse me I told you I was going off the rails you see God wooing this elect lady how many times as you read your Bible it's a word speaking of our love for the word over and over and over again the word of God speaking to us of the bride's love for the word amen my brother and sister if I wanted the voice of men you know they say if you want to be go to those who are so if you want to be rich you don't go down here someone living in poverty you want to be a good father a good husband you don't go to the one who hasn't seen his children and doesn't you know hasn't uh had a wife or maybe he's only third or fourth no you go to those who have been successful those who have done what you desire to be talking carnally and so you want to get rich you go take principles from a man who worked for it not somebody who happened to buy some little whatever you guys have Bitcoin forgive me but you didn't you know don't go do the guy all he's going to be able to do is say I I just went to the buy a Bitcoin and went click that's not how you build wealth my brother and sister because the day that that all crashes you crash with it amen and being religious you don't go to church and find the man who's religious and form your life after the man who's religious because when it all crashes you'll crash with it but you find those that have been through the fiery trials they've got scars and they maybe walk with a little hobble like Jacob would have had after his experience with God and those men that they oh you'll say but brother so and so you know he never gets upset well of course he never gets upset because he's confident in his wealth and himself but the man over here the devil is there saying you know what I'm going to make him look bad I'm going to make him look bad not just the world but I'm gonna make him look bad to himself and so you'll find a real Christian sometimes as a greater struggle you say but they're not even Christians they're not even believers they said the world should be falling apart no my brother and sister the devil already owns them he doesn't need to attack what he already owns he's pursuing what he knows he doesn't have amen and this elect lady has a love of the word you see God's not entertaining you and I amen we're not here but he's wooing us to a higher calling amen I don't want to be too bold or blunt or harsh this morning but I tell you if God is not wooing you today to a higher calling you need to stop find an altar get down and say Lord what is missing what is missing our calling is not at this level right here my brother and sister we have a higher calling we've been called in the presence of almighty God we've been called to be able to live to the very level of God Amen you say oh we're just mortal Flash no I have the very Spirit the word says you have the very Life of Christ in you and he does not have one life for himself and another life for you he has one life amen and that life is eternal life amen because you can't have another life and it produce eternal life unless it is the Life of Christ amen hallelujah amen now look at this in an exposition of the seven Church ages and the resume of the ages now some people just believe things are just words my brother and sister I believe things are just words but when you come to the place by God's grace you can measure the value of words measure the value flattery on the scale is as a feather but a true and honest compliment is as gold amen got a truckload of feathers you still don't have much or as my friend Jake Hofer says a thousand pound dog is a big dog what do you call Big what's great in your eyes might not be much in someone else's eyes but what I want is what is great in God's eyes because if we can get what is great in God's eyes we'll find that all of these other attributes and needs that we have in our life will all fall into place now I happen to believe in the Merit of these words brother Brown says here not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or organization I've never done that and I will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish this one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men now I'm going to be real bold this morning and I hope this doesn't offend anybody but this been on my heart for quite a while amen but you look at this my brother and sister the world we're living in today they say well it's all about binding the people to William Branham now you're going to believe them or you're going to believe his words amen I'm telling you I can stand here as a minister and declare to you what I know of myself and of my own life and I shake before God to know that I could have a negative influence on a life I don't want that responsibility but I tell you what I do love is my screensaver in my office at home keeps revolving and when I was done with my sermon this morning the last of the notes all done the screensaver is rolling through this and here's a picture of a little girl in Chile and she was there and literally had told her parents you can force me to go to this camp but when I get back from this Camp you can't stop me from running away and the parents are all desperate there's they're shook up we get to the camp one of the ministers brings the parents and they say brother Paul can you do something I said absolutely we can do something a little Ray of Hope comes am I going to go out and do some special little dance am I going to spell go do some special little encouraging word no my brother and sister they're looking in anticipation we're gonna pray a sincere prayer before God that God will touch her heart because if you as parents and the pastor of your church can't touch her heart the pastor's her grandfather if you can't touch your heart there's no way I'm touching her heart but I'll tell you my brother and sister when that little time together that Youth Camp was over that little girl standing in the front of the church tears streaming down crying out to God Amen God heard dad's prayer now God heard Mom's prayer God heard Grandpa's prayer God heard the preacher's prayer but most of all he already knew the desire of that child and deep down in that tile was something that was crying out and Satan was giving one picture wooing wooing wooing don't you want to be like the rest and be honest with you I don't want to be like the rest amen I don't want to be like to rest my brother and sister I just had a reminder the other day sounds judgmental I secretly all through high school and even just a little after that I chewed tobacco a few days ago I run into a guy that I know his front teeth top and bottom all gone still chewing tobacco he got wooed he got wooed my brother and sister you know when you come to a place that people just think you're weird anyway you know there's benefits to people thinking you're weird yeah because then you get to speak because you're not going to change their mind I'm like are you still chewing that filthy stuff what are you going to do wait till it eat your jaw off matter of fact I doctor says I have a little lesion well good I ought to go introduce you to a gentleman I know that lives in the town of Caldwell that they cut from right here in his chin all the way back here on his Jawbone and they fitted some other little thing there so his face is all together but I'm so cool benwood but you don't understand Paul you're one of those religious freaks that's right that's right I'm one of those religious freaks because when I reach this stage in my life God come wooing and he come started to speak to me and I won't go into all that you've heard it through the sermons through the year but God's speaking and I started to realize somebody's in love with me somebody's in love with me I already had a natural wife I wasn't looking for another woman but there was somebody in love with me and they started to woo me and pull me out of where I was to a higher calling he didn't say I want to take you down and kill you with cancer I want to take you over here and give you this disease I don't take you over here and cause you to lose your mind no he said I want to take you up a little higher come up higher come up higher that's what God's doing today my brother and sister God's calling higher but what we got to do is realize oh this is a little bold forgive me as I said that's been on my heart for quite a while amen the one thing we got to realize is that the desire of the word of God in this hour not man's desire God's desire is to establish a true spiritual relationship it's not an attendance roster it's not even I don't know how I feel to throw this out it's not about the money I don't even have a clue who pays tithes or offerings in this church and I will remain that way because I want to be able to preach with this kind of Liberty of not worrying about what this is and what that is and how they're going to feel about it it is here and if God doesn't want this church to exist God will shut it down if God wants it to grow it'll grow amen there's no man in control amen no man let it be the Holy Ghost in control Hallelujah to establish that relationship between God and Men amen where men become New Creation creations in Christ filled with his Spirit live according to his word always blows me away when they say well you can't be saved unless you believe branham's religion well you guys will bear with me my Bible shows who authored all of these books I'm shocked not one of them says Brandon but I can't take you in the word where it said these men of old wrote these books under the anointing of the Holy Ghost hmm wooing what are we wooed to true spiritual relationship a wooing is taking place now amen I'm just going to go on I'm going to plow forward I just pray you forgive me have Grace for Paul the impersonation of in Christianity when the Holy Spirit not the new degree not the new church not the new thought not the new emotion not the new oil not the new dance not the new lips not the new tongue you know I'm sorry but the new lips isn't Max Factor hmm it's coming in let me just tell you this sometimes you just put your own foot in your own mouth and after the fact just have to believe God's in control he's preaching in a church hitting painted fingernails I hope none of them are here today I hope you left them somewhere else like at the store and I just hammer down on that and as I'm preaching there I look up here's a sister with her head down and her hand up and she had the reddest fingernails that were about this long and I'm like Lord forgive me I spoke to the pastor I said I didn't mean to say anything that would be offensive he goes if God told you to speak it he said I have confidence that God intended for her to hear it I hope you have that kind of attitude or or do we need to soften that down I cut a couple quotes out today that would have just been real Barn burners but I didn't want the fire department down here wondering what all the smoke was but you see my brother and sister we're not looking for the new not the new tongue not the new this not the new that not not the new hat and when God places his spirit in the middle of your new spirit then you don't have to act Meek you don't have to act like a Christian it controls everything that's within you it puts you decent it makes the church act orderly amen makes the gifts work perfectly and if you have to be taken from a place where you think you should be and put down somewhere else it controls you no flopping I'll never come back again no sir that shows that the mainspring is not in there and when you blow up at every little thing that happens poisons that disposition and when the pastor happens to hit something that's in the word and you well I don't believe that look out old Calhoun see watch out the new mainstream hasn't been said in their right but it controls it makes you believe it makes you act in such a way till you become salty in the whole world thirsts to be like you that's the Holy Spirit sitting in the middle of your spirit it's a mainspring and it's when the Yoke that you're yoked with oh I just hate to go to church tonight oh I don't and that preacher if he wasn't so long-winded see I'm in the message amen I'm identified here I'd like to hear him a few minutes but I'll tell you what last time I went when I went down to the card party Susie told me no you mean to tell me that very audacity that you belittled yourself to take your hair down my brother and sister these people don't even know their Bible excuse me forgive me Lord my clumsiness they don't know their Bible they think that it's humiliating to submit to the word of God now I've said it and I'll say it again today if we're a cult we are in the most mismanaged cult on Earth because I want to know the last time brother Paul showed up at your house and told you how to live your life how to raise your children how to spend your money how to do anything can anybody lift their hand amen if we're a cult We Are The mismanaged Cult of the world but when the Holy Ghost comes down and starts to deal with people's lives and there's something inside of them wooing them change change change Can someone say I identify with that amen I want to change why it's not the preacher it's not the message it's a holy ghost that's wooing us to a higher calling to throw the trash out oh Hallelujah had somebody yeah we won't even go there praise the Lord amen it's the mainspring and then that the Yoke that you yoke with oh I just hate to go to church tonight preacher if he wasn't so long-winded I like to hear him a few minutes see there's something in there desires that but there's an influence so they're now in the midst of two decisions or one decision two thoughts I want to hear the preacher but I place Susie equal in influence to the word of God you see I didn't say to the preacher because if the preacher is a real preacher he's not preaching preacher stuff he's preaching the word of God play Susie her opinion equal with the word my goodness but Chris been preaching on a fair balance amen God fought enough of that to put it in his word let's give God a fair balance of our own lives let's not take and say well this is how I see it who cares how you see it what does the word of God say because if you don't care what the word says then why do you even bother measuring why is there even a comparison if you won't live the word hmm am I too hard this morning amen so you look at this see you know the very audacity that you belittled yourself to take down your hair you mean to tell me that you're not going to wear those shorts anymore Lydia well you see the thing of it is if you just get a new spirit it'll just kill you that's right but when you've got his spirit it makes every emotion tick just right to the word of God it'll tick right with the word and you'll say well now Susie just a moment the Bible says it's an Abomination before him to do that and the love of Christ has come into my heart and I love him too much to do that see I love him look where the wooing is at want a spirit of rebellion one saying I love God too much I love him too much to go against his word to push against it and reject that I love him too much what is it my brother and sister reminds me true story here young man that he literally already popped the question but she said you know I want to do this correctly that you need to talk to my dad first and so the young man's like okay I'll talk to your dad first in the meantime while he's waiting for opportunity to talk to Dad she goes on a date with another young man then she asked him have you talked to my daddy yet he said no I haven't and I don't plan on talking to it she's like why because obviously you liked him well enough and obviously there was something in me you didn't like well enough true story that girl breaks my heart that girl ended up being a very wild child because all I had to do is well anyway ah we won't go there Hallelujah love him too much now look my brother and sister let's do some marriage counseling this morning anybody need marriage counseling not one of you do but Paul does amen and Jerry does amen so so at least we've got enough to hold the conversation for marriage counseling my brother and sister you realize that um we should be going to the marriage counselor every single day amen but you have to understand that Satan is in the relationship business also and uh so he he works in that same realm amen and you know we can read every marriage enrichment book we want to amen you can just you can just read them and read them and read them and read them and you can take those marriage enrichment books and you can craft a near perfect marriage any of you have a near perfect marriage amen I'm going to lift my hand because even though I sometimes am not healthy the prophet of God told me I should declare I'm Healed so I have a near perfect or a perfect marriage because I believe that's what God has given me so you can take all these marriage enrichment books and you can read them and then you can sit down and draw graphs and put charts on the walls and say now you know because we are honey a modern day family we're going to divide uh the deal so uh do you want to just do all the dishes by meal uh by day of the week um do you want me to put the cups in the silverware in the dishwasher and you will put the bowls and the plates how do you want to do this okay we agree we map this all out it's at breakfast time he sets the table on Monday and she cooks the eggs on Tuesday she sets the table and he cooks the eggs and we do all this and we map it all out and we have almost a perfect marriage in fact some marriage counselors will tell you even divide your finances unscriptural but divide your finances and then agree on who pays what so that you don't ever have any arguments over money well I tell you what my marriage counseling book that I like to read says it never was my money in the beginning it belonged to God in the beginning amen and he's just made us to be the handlers of it of good stewardship so we divide all of this out and you know what we have this this couple we're talking about the alter ego of Jerry and Paul and we have a near perfect marriage and everybody's like we are so so proud of you guys how you get along so well and then one day we walk away and people say what happened well I never really loved her she never really loved me but you had such a good marriage oh we just read these books and the books told us how but you take every marriage enrichment book and seminar and reading and and podcasts and whatever else of our modern day and you listen to those things if you need to work some things out and then you put love in the middle of that relationship and now you've got something my brother and sister and people are here if you don't believe so just go on to the Christian book whatever catalog thing that comes in the mail what is that thing called Christian book club whatever it is my it comes to our house every once in a while if you bought every book in there you'd need to get a second job delivering pizzas and will it produce what it says it'll produce no we have to have love you can read this every day of your life you can pray every day of your life but if there's not love in this relationship what is wooing you what is wooing you my brother and sister you know people say well we need to have a better understanding there's there's words in the Hebrew and words in the Greek I'm telling you my brother and sister it didn't say you go to the upper room and wait there until you can understand Hebrew and you can understand Greek and you can understand aramic it said you go to an upper room and you wait on the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost comes you will understand all things oh my brother and sister he didn't say Young when you get a PhD preach the gospel it's told us to go and when we're endued with power from on high amen hallelujah so you read these books it does good but it sure helps when you're in love amen now Satan's in the relationship business also Amen in fact he's a bestseller he's got so much to say about it I'm not kidding the devil's got so much to say about it he's got all kinds of influence in the realm of how men and women should interact and relate my brother and sister I'm going to step away from the family and step into the spiritual world if you take something that God designed to run so close parallel with each other and you separated just into the natural side amen and you take that what you're going to end up with is an unbalanced marriage or relationship now you take that over into the spiritual side my brother and sister and you'll end up with a dominating female Spirit you only when people say what you're picking on the sisters no that's a spirit it gets on anyone that wants to get on or can get on and so what happens is God when he built this relationship built this relationship with balance in mind amen hallelujah and you look at this see now look at this what's happening now I don't want to embarrass anybody but um uh uh sister I don't know should I throw you under the bus oh I yeah more sisters farther back sorry sister Kerry but no Sister Sister April sent something she's been reading studying and I was like she's also been reading my notes I thought they looked Disturbed on my desk of course the way I do my notes you'd have a hard time Discerning what was a note and what was scrap paper but look at this sister April I I was going to bring it out and read the quote but I didn't amen now she oh let's stop for a second I skipped over a very key ingredient did you know there's another elect lady go in your Bible it's not hard to find her she wears Scarlet she has all kinds of faithful followers and her voice is considered the voice of authority and she's got children and she's meaner than a junkyard dog and your soul is worth nothing to her but she's wooing a little bit of research will show you Born Again Baptists studying to prove Catholicism wrong and becoming staunch supporters and missionaries for the Catholic Church fundamentalists rejecting the word of God what is it is it what they read on the page no it was a spirit they were anointed by so when they get anointed by that spirit because you see as I started the service this scripture those things got to be fulfilled they've got to come to fruition and so it is now this is talking about her the other elect lady now she is making love to her daughters wooing them right back home again with no spiritual understanding stripped it's an oasis for her they say oh what a grand thing it is oh my and Pentecostal men sitting in the council at Rome and sending letters around it was the most spiritual time they had ever seen How could a born-again man cut off his secret cut off the word and they live by the Creed that's exactly what Delilah has done today cutting off the word and you live by the Creed now I believe it's a year 2000 it was shared with us we could not find the video or I would have played it for you this morning but it was some Pentecostal preachers taking a visit to the Vatican having a personal audience with the Pope and when they come out of this personal audience they kissed the ring now if you're going to kiss at Robin Hood Style where you get outside the building and say look what I've got I might forgive you but my brother and sister they kissed the ring they come out of this and reporters are saying what was your experience and one of these uh Pentecostal preachers does just a little bit of a jig and he turns around speaks to the camera we're coming back to Mama look what's happening my brother and sister the word of God will come to pass and now we're seeing and I'll just give you a hint of what's what sister April shared and what it was it's there the prophet of God talking about how that they will band together with one common cause not religious they're not coming to say we're all on the same page so we're going to throw our hat in the ring they're coming because they're going to fight communism by coming in an ecumenical council and joining together to fight communism and my brother and sister if that is not what is happening today you have got everything from the church of England and all of this other religions all supporting the war it must take place this must happen we've got to fight against this evil and they don't recognize even the very Bible they claim to believe has declared that they are not fighting against flesh and blood but they are fighting against spiritual warfare principalities and Powers my brother and sister and it all sounds good we need to do this we need to stop this uh indecent uh treatment on moral treatment ungodly treatments but they don't realize the very one that they are stepping into being wooed being rude is the one that is responsible for killing Millions Through the Ages they are giving themselves to the greatest mass murderer that's ever been on the face of the Earth believing their doing goddess service it's stunning it is the most spiritual time they had ever seen they hadn't seen much I'm telling you how could a born-again man cut off his secret cut off the word and then live by Creed but it's happening my brother and sister your computer if you want to study it is clear full of it clear full of it amen now as we look into the Ephesians we realize that one of the things that God had against the Ephesian Church ate was the fact that they had left their first love now so it's pretty strong accusation my brother and sister if we saw that in the natural we saw that you know a husband and wife married for a while one or the other of them just decide you know what I don't need you this is more attractive over here we would look and and we would just be shocked but you'll see in the spiritual realm that people come and they come to a moment that they feel like I cannot bear with this any longer I see a flaw here I see a flaw here I see a flaw there and look at this now my brother and sister I want you to find me something flawless we'll dismiss church and we'll reconvene about seven o'clock tonight and I want somebody to bring us something that's flawless the only thing we could do would be to bring the word of God There's No Object no car plane train book clothes tool flawless so we come to a place we decide you realize it's only a matter of Step or two we won't go into it much but it's in scripture Malik you tell me how started off we want to please you Lord offering sacrifices pretty soon somebody said I gotta offer a greater sacrifice what can I offer that's greater than what I have offered and they would look around and maybe one of their little children's would Scamper by and say that's the highest level of something that I love and attached to and they said I'm going to do this for Satan no sir no they said I'm doing this for God and they started to offer their children and they sacrificed their children believing they were doing God service now I want you to jump to the year 2023. and Christians still sacrificing their children huh am I speaking too straight okay How do they how do they do that how do they do that they were rude have you guys seen the news coming out of Kenya I hope you don't don't go look it up it's horrific you want to know what a cult is you go study Kenya you guys will be doing God a favor doing God a blessing doing service to God starve yourself to death starve your children first to make sure they're gone then starve yourself to death this is serving God no I'm here to tell you this morning Saints you want to do God to service a greater service live all that is within you keep this old vessel healthy and live it for Jesus Christ Proclaim his name his voice his word from the rooftops children God is real neighbor God is real amen and woo them with your life amen don't just tell him about Jesus Christ let your life woo your neighbor let your life woo your family let it woo your children oh but what's happening my brother and sister just as it was in the Ephesian age they slowly got wooed away from their first love they were on fire Saints don't get an idea they were just a bunch of hillbilliesha you know uneducated whatever these were people that were on fire for God and they slowly got rude away they slowly got caught up and you might say the cares of Life hemlines come up blouses went down things that we wouldn't do we do now all of this is a slow wooing wooing I'm just gonna let all the stops out y'all might really consider anyway man I grew up with I considered him a good friend Pastor to church there was a young lady in that church and marriage issues ultimately ended up being divorced when my friend whose name happened to be Paul also his wife passes away he renews a friendship with this young lady she's divorced now you say oh these things how can it be I'll tell you how it can be we watched a denomination that did not believe in divorced preachers change their whole religion and rules because of him being such a dynamic speaker and we don't want to lose him overnight overnight Church went from we're standing on the word two were standing on most of the word who would who one preacher said well he'll be able to relate to all of these families relate what to them I'll tell you what you relate the church will change the rules for you but I want the rules to be changed for me I want to conform to the rule as it were if you want to call them rules I don't even consider them rules amen I want to change to meet God's word I don't want the word to change to me me amen I want to be wooed to a higher calling amen now look you guys went hiking amen I know that I know that brother Alex and some of the family they went hiking and and they were just sharing our sister was sharing how that it was it was just tiring climbing up the hills and did you know that um I'd rather go uphill than down though absolutely see God even when it comes to hiking amen what is that we're talking about that over over Landing yes over Landing you know that's where you take and you you take a vehicle or whatever and you go and you find places you hike you climb you travel climb through the mud through this through that all this stuff that's great but even in all of that God put the principle and anchored it that it's easier to go uphill than downhill and if you don't think so I will climb from the bottom to the top and you get to go to the Top by vehicle and come to the bottom and then the next day or two we'll find out whose body hurts the most you're not going to believe the fact that going downhill causes greater pain in your body than going uphill you have a pain in your lungs and an ache in your muscles on the way up but you stretch and you strain am I right Sister Sarah you end up with sore toes your heels hurt your ankles feel flexed maybe I'm different sister Sarah's like he's a wimp yeah going uphill you know your heel supported in a correct shoe and everything's in its right place and you climb but you know going downhill you're just practicing to become a ballerina everything's just out of its place if you don't think so just come up here and stand with me for a little bit we'll see how long it is before you're not comfortable you see it always is the principle that we think that we take the easiest route but God literally put within us an ability to recover from the hard trials from the fiery trials anybody know what time it is oh my oh my well maybe we'll take a break and you have some coffee and donuts and then we'll come back and finish but you see Revelations 2 4 says you know nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love there was something in there that they could not stick they weren't able to abide what was it it wasn't they were necessarily rejecting the word but somebody presented them a wooing that seemed to make more sense and it was there that they were attracted to that and wouldn't it be nice Saints if we could just live any way we wanted and still say we were message believers it would until you crashed and burned you know um I'm gonna I'm gonna skip ahead here once again I want to drive home to you God has no grandchildren you either have an on fire holy ghost-filled relationship with God or you're just another human on Earth hmm that's not very polite brother Paul and no we don't pass it on with natural birth and we can't pass it on with Apostolic succession it's got to be something that's called of God gifts given of God can someone raise a hand and say thank you Lord amen it didn't come because I was born in the family and my family are Christians and no no God chose you God called you God said you're one that I have predestinated from the foundation of the world and I have poured out Heaven and Earth for you oh my that's a pretty big investment my brother and sister amen now look at this here I just want to read this short deal the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word The Cry of reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it's cooled off and become a bit formal that is what happened there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out now this might seem a little strange and no I haven't leaped off any Cliffs or sniffed any glue but my brother and sister I'm telling you it's getting further and further that people would be embarrassed if we had an outbreak like that in our church be embarrassed if somebody jumped up and said thank you Lord for saving my soul if somebody got beside themselves we would be like calm down it's not the end of the world but it's close you see my brothers and sisters because it's fading it's fading but you see God comes along and you think okay if they're fading that it's over but God comes along and rekindles the flame my look how excited Israel was when they left Egypt I'm telling you I've set before I have a vivid imagination as a kid teachers used to get all over me what are you daydreaming about well you know I never explained it to them they wouldn't have understood but my brother and sister there it was that it's there and they're coming and the the Fulfillment of Prophecy and they're leaving Israel I mean Egypt and they're coming out and there was a boldness That Came Upon them there wasn't a timid people that left Egypt and it was a bold people and they went over to the neighbors give me your pots and pans and I need that bag of flour and I want this and I need that I need your cart too and I want the ox and they went out of there in history shows us they went out of there when they didn't have tambourines they went out of there with two pans together if they showed up at our church we would turn them out because they're just way too carried away don't they realize the current state of religion oh oh come on let's just be blind Paul current state of the message no I'm not advocating that we go pound on everything and jump up and down and kick every chair and Pew over my brother's sister there's balance there's balance we don't want to have the kind of religion that when the Music Stops our worship stops we want to walk out of church with what our religion is being that we love the Lord enough that we take him everywhere amen and we're willing to worship him everywhere may you look at this now what did they do they come out of there and it wasn't long that all that excitement the pots and the pans shouting and Simon it faded then God brought him to a place and restores it and they go for a season and it fades Rises up Fades Rises up Fades I'm talking about your week last week why some of you look nervous you know they've invented drones and directional mics and we need to feel the need to keep track of all of you to know your spiritual condition nonsense God knows the up and the down of our life he knows the rhythm of our life and he has Mercy on us and he never stops wooing US never never stops wooing US never comes to the place he says you've had a down once many times done with you he Woos us again and again and again we're going to call this good because I have I should have known that I just had too much information here you know Ephesians 4 1 Paul speaking to the Ephesians says Ah therefore a prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called so God wants us to do Saints he wants us to walk amen we'll just have to make another part of this because now I want to go into the voice of this relationship hmm but sister serif he'll come you see my brother and sister it has to be a voice in your relationship really yeah really if God's not talking to you if God's did you hear me if God's not talking to you something's missing in the relationship God help us God help us Lord speak to me but the scripture tells us to be still and know that I am God amen Satan has wooed us into our own version of a 20-hour a day day go go go what is he doing he doesn't need to take your Doctrine away from you doesn't got to take your Bible away from you he doesn't have to take the message away from you he doesn't have to cause you to be divorced and homeless and this and that all he's got to do is just slowly remove God from your life it's what he did in the garden Eve didn't even realize she left God behind she didn't have a clue she had left God behind and Satan did what bought her a big screen [Music] bought her a sports car bought her a bigger house he's too busy to clean no sir he just changed the word it's changed the word and that caused a fracture in the relationship suddenly she was spiritualized and she hadn't just as much Revelation as Adam did so much Revelation in fact they quit calling on God I hope we haven't reached that place since now we've got so much Revelation we've quit calling amen let's stand just Worship the Lord a little bit amen sorry that I drug this out time got away from me I looked at it a little bit ago and it seemed like it was not even close to noon [Music] you wonder about this though things like John 10 foreign you know they come and they're uptight with Jesus you know how you how long are you gonna make us doubt if you be the Christ just tell us plainly and he turns right around and he says I told you I've already told you see they're going to be looking my brother and sister they're going to say it wasn't wasn't this to happen wasn't that to happen wasn't this voice supposed to have spoken he's already come it's already happened because you see they missed it and Jesus says I already I already told you and while they never said you go through the passage of scripture they never said we don't believe you but the refusal to act upon it was their words we don't believe you and so it's there and they're they're they're going to be upset but you believe not because you're not my sheep as I said unto you yeah that's my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me aren't you glad today I've been wooed amen I still Marvel I've never been there in person but it still happens to this day people tourists go they video it they take the Sheep right down through the marketplace and those sheep do not turn to the right or left he doesn't have to go buy all the fruit in the marketplace because his sheep have destroyed it because his sheep know his voice and he's in front of them continuing to tell them just follow me just follow me follow me and they realize I don't have time to get involved with laodicea I don't have time to become part of this culture we call it you want to find a real
