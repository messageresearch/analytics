mighty power and his grace [Music] I can hear the brush of angels's wings I see glory on each face surely is in this place let's sing it again surely the presence of of the Lord is in this place I can feel his mighty power and his grace I can hear the brush of angels wings I see glory on each face surely the presence of the Lord is in this place amen how beautiful it is to be able to Worship the Lord we live in a day just as I was studying this last week we live in a day that so much prophecy coming to pass and yet people say was it prophecy yeah when the prophet of God said this is what it will be in that day that's prophecy but it's also the word the word showed us you know I I I I don't say this to be funny but I'm starting to have a little sympathy for those in Sodom because when you realize that this day will be like Sodom was Sodom was a wreck and you know the people we can have a very um hard opinion you know the the people but my brother and sister we're looking at a day now that people just don't even know what to believe you you visit with people and they say I I I think or I desire but there's nothing there to to move them forward nothing there for them to take a hold of and yet there's not a a real desire in them to pursue it you try to share truth and and they're afraid of being deceived so they won't they won't move so we are a blessed people much more than we we recognize amen obviously been announce the youth banquet please be praying amen I just believe it'll be a wonderful time for the young people to enjoy themselves to meet uh uh other young people and renew friendships and uh we just look at that and then brother rap will be speaking here at the church on Sunday uh and we're looking forward to that also I also have a little note here um uh personal note remember brother saleim uh he still does not have a job has went to interviews applied and uh he he certainly uh needs the Lord to come on this scene and and help him to find a job sister Wonder his natural sister um sister Wander is uh Desiring a job that would allow her to be in church um that wouldn't be such a difficult schedule for her life uh and um I I have to applaud her our sister because um sometimes you know she gets off work like last Sunday she got off work and has hardly any time to rest and then she's coming to church and we certainly uh would desire the Lord to bless her for for that effort so good to see each and every one of you amen uh you guys I miss you and uh Camden Logan uh I really miss you guys's faces and sister Sammy you have wonderful Sons uh and um uh we just say God bless you and it's good to see you here today and everyone of you amen let's just go right into the word of God I appreciate our our uh helpful hands today um you know uh for the music and uh for others uh sister Donna Conquering the young men in the basement uh just appreciate that to be able to cover that and and each one of you I feel very appreciative today God bless you amen I want to speak to you today on our vision of Victory and um when we look at this the reason that I settled on this title not only uh because it fits very much into the scripture but you know my brother and sister it what you what you think is going to happen uh will often times you say well I I don't I don't think I can I can do this uh can you really put 100% effort in something you don't think you can accomplish I would say in the human element you don't but yet if we would have a vision of Victory then we would look at this and we would say no matter what happens in the world today amen I I don't know how much you pay attention to news I I go online and I click on that and you know what you see in the news is what they want you to see in the news right the other side of the story doesn't often appear it's what they want you to see and yet my brother and sister there's profit and Chaos so they don't mind making the whole message a message of chaos but we are Sons and Daughters of God we have the word of God and the message that has come to us is not a message of chaos it is a message of Peace it is a message of redemption it's a message of God's promises coming to pass in our life and so we can look at the evening news as it were the morning news and we can choose to follow that or we can follow the good news and the good news is pointing to a positive outcome for you and I I'm not worried about financial crisis I'm not worried about Armageddon I'm not worried about the things that the prophet of God said that the bride of Christ would be redeemed before they took place and so I'm just going to believe that and and I I'll put this out my brother and sister no matter what we believe as Christians no matter the differing of our opinion if you're not fully committed you're not committed and so some people say well I I want to I want to uh keep ourselves protected I don't want to get too extreme I don't want to get too far out on the limb just in case I hear to cracking my brother and sister as we've been called by the word of God in this hour let's be committed amen let's turn in our Bibles amen sister Wonder wonderful to see you amen there coming in amen let's turn 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and uh verse 51-58 and um as we'll talk on this our vision of Victory we'll realize that uh the word of God has so clearly stated uh our position for us and uh as we'll sit there if we choose not to to take our position who do we have to blame there's so many people today sorry to say this as it might sound negative but I don't mean it that way but my brother and sister so many people have turned and walked away from the message and as you interact with them you what they offer up as a reason my brother and sister is not really a reason it's an excuse and they were not committed they weren't willing to to take the final step they actually were anointed then without being committed you know let me put it this way when you are on the fence what influence is the greatest offense uh uh effect upon you there is a phrase that I come across here recently positive move positive news moves you an inch negative news moves you a mile and so it all depends see straddling the fence what will happen to us the influence that will come we will find that the negative Satan's there 24 hours a day anointing that you can't live it it's got something wrong this this this and this and you look at that and then the word of God comes and says I've got a proven track record from the foundation of the world I'm here to tell you just trust my word God gives us a few words Satan gives us thousands of words God offers believe it or not a little evidence Satan offers a lot now you say whatat do you mean offers a little evidence God is not going to pound you Satan does so God says just believe my word trust me Satan says I've got Rams of evidence why it can't be so my brother and sister we are subject that's why the television Vision the prophet God said could have been a great tool for the gospel but Satan got a holds of it and if you go I'm not encouraging to go by television so you can confirm this but if you go and what you see of the Gospel on television today it's not the gospel we were called to serve so even in the good news it's still bad news but we're here for the good news 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible we shall be changed amen not we hope to be right we shall be changed for corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory can we say amen and thank you Lord amen oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God and I say that this morning thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord each and every one those not here today Father uh those of circumstances father surrounding we ask you Lord to meet each and every one in their place father and speak to Hearts touch lives give Liberty father give peace and joy and happiness replace the anxieties and fears Lord with a comfort and a trust in your word Lord we believe in your word and we stand on your word today and ask you Lord now to come just reveal in US Lord a greater portion of you father we thank you for this opportunity today in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen as we look at this scripture you know as you study that you you look and you realize just how pertinent it is to the day that we live in for the very Gospel of Jesus Christ is a mystery to many but my brother and sisters it says that you know we're not going to all sleep but uh shall be changed and we'll look at that and real realize that um the scripture saying that those that have passed on to the other side shall not hinder those of us that are still here in the midst of the battle and we'll look at this and as you read this we'll look and you know we start to realize you know oh my I haven't I'm not attaining I'm in the B midst of a battle I've made mistakes this last day week month year whatever it might be and and you know I just wonder about this but you know the word is so faithful and true God is not speaking to our present circumstance God is speaking to his word he's speaking the word to the word and if the word is in us then he's obviously speaking to us and my brother and sister we'll look at this and realize that in in the natural uh we would look at that and say well you know when one passes from this life uh and he was a Believer he is swallowed up in Victory but you know as we'll look a little deeper in the word of God we'll realize that death sometimes in the relevance of the scripture is our natural death to our s and it's there as we would just die to ourselves we would allow the word of God to live and it is there that Satan would desire to keep us in a spiritual grave here today but uh we have been called from that grave and and so death where is I sting oh grave where is thy Victory and we see my brother and sister that we've been given the victory from our Lord Jesus Christ and that is something that we should never let pass from our thinking NE never let it pass from our Consciousness that we have been given the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I don't care how bad your day is I don't care what the troubles they are whether it's family whether it's work whether it's finances or whatever it might be none of that matters because Christ Jesus has given you the victory and as we stand here today the Paradox of having that Victory is is pretty strong I I believe you're you're very similar I know each and every one of you that uh we have our days that we feel like that we have failed the Lord we have failed our own testimony but we'll find that as we go through the service today that God is using that not to to uh have us come to a place that we waver of who I am and what I am and what I was called for but to realize that you and the flesh are enity to God that's simple we will face our our our challenges of life and realize that this flesh is literally an enemy of God and so it's there that God wants you and I to to be able to look beyond that and realize that it's the promise of the word that we have been given victory in not this flesh not coming to to be a as it were superch Christian but we're standing here today submitted to the word and the word is promised to take us through so if we can catch a real Revelation a real understanding of this scripture the mystery of it amen what it's bringing forth here is a vision of our future it's not talking about yesterday or or days gone by but it it's telling us what our future will be as Sons and Daughters of God and so if our future is according to this word here this mystery then my brother and sister we have our Victory today we're not looking for a victory somewhere down through the years some later time in our life maybe when we get older and it will be simpler but I'm here to tell you I'm getting older and it doesn't get any simpler amen battles are battles struggle is struggle and our challenges just change from one kind of a challenge to another kind of a challenge and so it's there that we must realize today that we have been called to have Victory today don't look for victory this evening or Victory tomorrow claim your Victory today because this is what God has declared to you and I and if you are willing to give Victory off till another day I just throw a little history out there in World War II there was a time in a place the soldiers were weary and they were there and and the generals decided that they were not going to press the battle any further that day and what they didn't know is they had come so close to defeating the enemy at that point it was just there that it was at the breaking point and the generals looked at their own men and said we're going to give them a break and what the break ended up being is the enemy over the night brought in more and more reinforcements over the night the enemy come and reinforce their position and in the morning the battle was much greater than it had been in the evening time and I say today press the battle don't sit and say Lord I'm looking to have Deliverance I'm looking to have something better tomorrow amen press the battle today because God has promised you Victory amen and it's there that we have to trust the Lord to know that remember the word says he will not try you greater than you can endure so you need to stand on the word today I need to stand on the word today and claim our Victory today now it's not just a partial victory that God's trying to give to you and I but he's given us a victory over everything you notice the scripture doesn't give an exclusion the scripture doesn't say well I'll give you victory over everything but your temper or I give you a victory over everything but your procrastination Lord help Paul on that one amen but it's there he's given us a victory over everything now you know sometimes my brother and sister as I already mentioned sometimes anything less than a full commitment is insufficient amen but here the words encouraging us to give a full commitment because our labor is not in vain have you ever have you ever had something that you labored to do a and you you couldn't complete it you couldn't finish it you couldn't do the scripture tells us that if you're going to build build a house count the cost first so that you don't get it partially completed and abandon it and there it is in our spiritual Walk we're building a house amen let's not come to a place that we just languish in in that uh that knowing that one of these days I'm going to be able to step back in and I'll finish this what'll happen is you'll have a lot of negligence that you'll have to repair before you'll actually be able to move forward make progress once again so as you're in the battle as you're there and God is helping you leading you guiding you amen trust him to give you the strength and the resource to finish the battle that you're in Amen in other words no compromise with the devil to come along and we'll overcome that later he wants you to overcome it now so make a full commitment that your labor would not be in vain now imagine that we today would sit here in the house of God how you would feel if if brother Paul just started preaching about being a partial Overcomer that let's just go ahead and and let's just leave a certain portion of our flesh our problems let's just leave them alone and and let's just take what we want uh you know we made it to church today that ought to satisfy the preacher you know we're just partial Overcomers you you would as Believers of the message of the hour you would say what's going on with Paul something's wrong long here that he's not telling us to press to the mark of the high calling just press to the mark that you feel like you can do you wouldn't like that you wouldn't accept that amen so let's not view ourselves today as partial Overcomers amen we are Overcomers in Jesus Christ amen amen so we look at this and realize that we can have a mental Paradox have any of you ever had a mental paradox yeah we as humans are such incredibly complex and mysterious people on one day we can be so confident and maybe before that 2 24 hours is up we are mentally staggering unable to stand and say I I I believe that I'm a Believer I believe that I've called of God I believe I'm the Bride of of Jesus Christ because we come and face battles that we say I wasn't prepared for but it might not be that we weren't prepared for it it might be that we did not approach the battle correctly in fact uh without having so much time today several loose ends you might say of this but my brother and sister brother brandham shows us so clearly that every time we start to try to battle this battle in the flesh with our flesh we will find ourselves defeated we are not called to fight Satan with our flesh we were called to fight him with the word and so if we don't approach the battle correctly then we act shocked when we don't win the battle when we find ourselves uh uh buffeted and and beaten as it were and bloodied and we wonder why I I'm a Christian I wonder why this is and there's the mental Paradox is because we weren't called to battle it on our ability of what we know or what we can do but we were called to battle the battle by the word and when we take the word and place it before us as our banner and March into the battle with the banner of the word before us we find ourselves Victorious but the human element are there any humans here today I just went on a little deal that you know I was shocked I was entering a deal about some uh stuff concerning in the farm and a little box and I'm sure you all know what it is it pops up there and it wants to know if I'm a human or a bot and then it had all of these weird little things there and I'm looking at them going I don't have a clue which one of these I'm supposed they all look the same to me so take the mouse eeny meeny miny mo eeny meeny miny yeah anyway I just clicked on it and it said oh you're human okay how did it know maybe it was a hesitation I don't know but you know you look at that and and we come to the place my brother and sister that you don't have to you know show show that you're a bot or a human uh we are humans and we Face things as humans we think like humans we react like humans and we approach God like humans and we got to come and approach God from the context of what the prophet showed us that you're no longer just a human now if you take this at the surface you're going to be confused but we're not approaching this like a human my brother and sister we're not just humans we're Sons and Daughters of God and that's how we need to approach the word of God we need to approach the challenge of Life the battles that we Face the questions that need answers we need to face them and approach them as Sons and Daughters of God not as just some human but if we're living in the flesh Walking In the Flesh serving God In the Flesh and not in the word we are going to react In the Flesh that's why the prophet of God says we should pray over everything we should ask God's wisdom even in the simplest things of our life everything according to scripture says it should be Lord willing oh I say if we could come to the place in our life that we put the word to that high of place in our life that we would approach the word and say Lord willing and Lord thy will be done we would find a lot less questions a lot less things we have to back up on to to find the answer or to repair amen so we look at this see the flesh seems to be such a part of us the real truth is we are the word now I don't want to be too direct this morning but I want to tell you we got to quit reacting in the flesh and start reacting of who we really are and that is the word and when we do that we'll find it's a challenge trust me it's a challenge there's nothing easy about this amen but when we do this we'll find that everything else but the word gets left behind now my brother and sister this this might seem like a crazy analogy to you quite a few years ago now actually been a few decades some man had the brilliant idea down in California in the CTO to go mine what had been mined in the great Gold Rush now times had changed here's huge mounds of dirt out there and all of this landscape been rearranged and this man looked at that it's been that way for so long there's Big Trees growed up and everything and he looked at that soil and he thought times have changed there's there's what he called life that was what life was gold was his life he said there's got to be life in this he went out there and he bought up very quietly all kinds of mineral rights took modern-day equipment out there and started mining that and my brother and sister you talk about a modern motherload of all the gold and all the silver that had been passed over in days gone by now you say brother Paul where are you going here I tell you we have the greatest revelation of the word greater than ages gone by and we are sitting here today and it's time for us not to just sit back and say that's been preached or that's been this and that's been that and and even the Apostle Paul dealt with this and and they did this my brother and sister what God wants you and I to do is go back into the word because that's where life is at we don't want to stop and say h you know oh we're going to just go here otherwise let's go back and just be Lutheran let's just be methodists let's it's all been mined it's all been done it's all been revealed it's all been brought forth but that's not the case my brother and sister it's the word of God and regardless of who's touched it and preached it and tried to live it in the past this is the last and final age and the season has changed and the word has come for you and I to go back and mine the word of God again go back and mine our own lives again to see who we actually are and to see what God's blessings are for us and my brother and sister just to close out that little story they went back and and of course he had bought up a huge chunk of these mineral rights my brother and sister it turns out obviously gold and silver was worth way more money in in this time than then but there was Millions upon millions of dollars of gold and silver that they mined out of the what was throwed to the side years ago don't let someone throw the word to the side and then we ignore the word because that was there it was put there like that no my brother and sister God wants you and I to go back through through the word he wants us to find in the word our Victory today not looking for some new idea of our own but just to go back and dig through the resource of the word to come amen the just shall live by faith should actually mean more to you and I than it did to them now Apostle Paul we hold him foundational do we we not word of God says if anything was preached that he didn't preach let it be cursed so Paul is very pivotal pivotal in the word Romans 714- 2 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal can anyone say Amen to that but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that do I am I talking on familiar ground here if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me now let's just stop there for a minute my brother and sister if we are speaking from Paul's personal account not just just words not just preaching Paul is actually declaring from his mouth from his voice that he's coming to a place that he has a paradox in his life that that that I would not I do you know that means Paul's just like you and I yeah we don't like to admit that we're Believers we have the word of the hour we don't make mistakes we don't have fusses we don't this we don't that no the Apostle Paul's tell tell you the things that I would not I do them and the things that I should do I don't do them so where is this Paradox do it mean Paul was backslid when he wrote these words no he's facing the battle just like you and I face it he's facing the same kind of troubles the same kind of spirits the same kind of of demons that is assaulting him and he's telling you this is the human reaction I'm sure a lot of people thought Paul must have missed the boss on this but he goes on to say for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing if there's no good thing in me then I should just quit serving God right no because God's not redeeming flesh God has redeemed Sons and Daughters of God which is a spirit man for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the external man no the inward man amen that's what brings us to the place that Paul is now going to declare and did through this scripture declare to you emphatically I Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ declare unto you he wasn't in the flesh any longer he was dwelling in the spirit realm of revelation of who he was in Jesus Christ and he's trying to pull you and I into that same position not to live and not think and to dwell in the flesh but come over here into the realm that we are as Sons and Daughters of God we have our place in the word we have what describes us how we were placed before the foundation of the world we have that but as long as we're still lingering in the Battleground the Borderland of the flesh coming into the spirit Satan's going to going to Buffet us you say brother Paul how do we get away from that well the only way we'll get away from that is to get into the word and when we get into the word my brother and sister we find Victory can someone agree with me this morning the more time we spend in the word the greater victory that we stand on today we get up in the morning and it's not a dismal uh uh thing it's not a discouraging thing because we're bent in the word and the word lingers as the Holy Spirit lingers with us the word lingers with us when we've been immersed in the word it just stays as a sweet odor of presence it stays there with us and you say I'm just having such an up and down battle I'm not judging you this morning I'm not speaking hard on you this morning but I want to ask you how much time are you in the word that will Define the up and down oscillation of your life the less that you are in the word the greater the oscillation of your life the highs and the lows but when you get in the word you will find that the word becomes your balance it becomes your stabilizer my brother and sister it's not the size of the ship you realize you can look this up if you would like cruise ships everybody's like they're so huge and that that makes them so stable my brother and sister a huge ship is no more stable than a smaller ship but they have stabilizers and you need a stabilizer on the sea of life you need to have that they have those great stabilizers that when they're cruising they put those out and then it creates a balance in the ship that it's not rocking how about you and I coming to the place in the word that we put a stabilizer out in our life put something out there that causes the oscillation of our life the up and down to be uh balanced and stabilized that we're no longer tossed H you guys are quiet this morning am I preaching too hard okay you see what we need is to come to a place the fruition of this scripture now if I would do that I would not as no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me if I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me and then here is a shift between verse 21 and verse 22 for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man see how it's talking about when I do this sin is present with me when I'm in this position this is the trouble but all of a sudden he comes and he's turning this for you and I to see that it's not I'm delighting in my sin I'm not delighting in my unbelief I'm not delighting in my circumstance I Delight in the inward man I'm delighting in the word that is in me not in me as a human not in me as my intrinsic value I'm delighting in the word that is in me but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members my brother and sister known fact I believe you'll acknowledge it today the more you think about something the more inclined you are to do it now I don't do this I've embraced brother Ivan's Doctrine and uh everything I drive has had a dent in it before but you go down to a car dealer I've done this before because I was thinking about doing something and price of vehicles had declined considerably this is back a few years and I was thinking I wanted to buy a uh uh diesel pickup and I went to a dealer and uh what the dealer offered me was basically borderline on ridiculous here's a pickup this many miles this what it's worth you need to buy it today and sister Jerry and I had already made a commitment to each other we were not buying anything that day period that salesman just kept me going around and around this pickup talking about how wonderful it'd be to drive this pickup new tires new brakes perfect paint look how comfortable these leather seats would be everything about this truck is what you need and you know every time I walked around that pickup my resolve lowered and not and he kept me they know what they're doing if you've ever been cornered by one and walked out of there with the keys to something you had resolved not to own you'll know how good they are at their job and he just kept going around there and telling me and finally I just had to look at him I said sir you're pretty good at your job and he said yeah if it wasn't for the downturn in economy I wouldn't be desperate right now I made $250,000 last year selling cars and I made 50,000 in this whole year and this was in December he said I'm starving and that's why you are going to buy this pickup from me and it was at that point I looked him in the face and said but I made a commitment with my wife we weren't buying a pickup today so nice to meet you sir Christian denominational Christian man God bless you and I hope that you actually can in the next two weeks sell $100,000 worth of cars but my faith isn't real listed on lifted up on that you know the minute we got in our car and drove away that atmosphere that Spirit yeah amen I don't need to spend 50 Grand on a pickup yeah no more we talk about it that's the closer we're drawn to it now what manner of conversation now something the Lord's laid on my heart I don't want to go too far into it probably be speaking somewhat on this maybe in early services in South Africa but on the road to emus which is actually a type of the Journey of Our Lives my brother and sister when Jesus comes out and meets those men on the road to emus what does he say to them what what are you talking about what man of conversation are you in and are sad you know they had the option to have said you know what Jesus Christ come he spoke the word to us it's a Living Word we don't understand it but it'll come to pass because Jesus said it but my brother and sister they're there we thought it would be this and we thought it would be that we thought serving God would be easy we thought that when God would answer all of our prayers we thought God would do this and do this and do this and and it's just a bummer and we wonder why we're sad we wonder why we are sitting here today in the back of our minds with I don't know what to do about this I don't know what to do about this and I disagree with my wife or husband on this and and we have this problem we have that problem wonder why you're sad and we've got a word of God I hope you don't think I'm too blunt today we've got a word of God that's telling us today that we should look into to this mystery that says that we're not going to all pass we're going to some go right oh I'm just caught up here excuse me amen we're not going to be caught my brother and sister all going to a grave amen some are going to be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord and we should be looking at that instead of all these other things that leave us sad we're not looking at the things of the word that make us happy we're looking at the things of the flesh that are making us sad the things of this world that are finding us when the word of God is right there to loose us amen hopefully I'm not too too overbearing this morning but in verse 23 I see another me another law on my members Waring against the law of my mind now look at this the law of your mind you as Sons and Daughters of God your mind has been anointed by God to think about life life and Liberty to think about those things of the Holy Ghost right now you know I put it out to you if I was to approach each one of you directly we should be able to name way more than one or two of the things that God has done for us it shouldn't be what our problem is it shouldn't be that there you know can we handle this Saints Lord Jesus come down in our journey to emus and says you know what you guys are fools and slow of heart can you handle that if if if brother Paul come out well maybe he is and said you're fools and slow of heart slow to believe the word come on let's not be those people Saints don't don't view it as Paul sitting here standing here in in the in the pulpit and you're in the Pew I'm with you out there God help us to not be slow of heart and let all this other things come in of we thought he was here to deliver us we thought he was to conquer the Romans we thought it was this we thought it was that why don't we just take God at his word and let the word be what lifts us up and what guides us what gives us Direction what gives us Liberty amen verse 24 oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death well we know who's going to deliver us I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin and I believe every one of us would have to say Amen to that today that that's where we're at but that isn't where we're going to stay amen we already have the word here says that isn't where you're going to stay you're going to come to the place perfect in God's eyes being lifted up drawn up into Glory not going to be captured and dead in this flesh dead in sin and trespass dead in that realm my brother and sister but we've been given the law of Liberty amen now I'll tell you the Apostle Paul's gospel is not a gospel for the faint of heart it's not a gospel for people that are looking for something easy convenient it's so interesting how that we as humans approach things we some of you say I don't do that but I think we can apply this to 100% of humanity if there's a shortcut we'll take it yeah if there's a shortcut there we'll take it but Paul's gospel is not a gospel of shortcuts Paul's gospel is a gospel that is for warriors it is for people that will settle for nothing less than complete Victory and you don't have complete Victory by taking shortcuts amen you don't have complete Victory knowing that the only way you got Victory is because there was some secret Avenue for you to get there that you didn't have to face all of the battle my brother and sister I'm telling you the struggle is real Can someone say Amen to that but I want to also make this statement the victory is is real can we say Amen to that with Vigor amen the victory is real so why Focus or or just totally completely focus on the struggle when we are here and able to focus on the spiritual the Eternal the victory that the word has promised to us as Believers in this day let that be our Focus you know when you are more than a conqueror you don't need a shortcut amen God already given you everything to face every battle amen the goliaths of our life amen you know what happens we go and and we go to special meetings we're coming up on this youth banquet we go there and there's a certain anointing there's a certain something there people get excited about that they're like oh praise God we'll do this I spoke this on my very last service at the at the uh Newport youth uh uh basically two times a two Services uh two years ago my brother and sister sooner or later you're going to face your Goliath you want to face him prepared or unprepared you want to face him thinking God's going to give you a shortcut or God's going to give you the right stones to throw amen there comes a time that we as Believers should be stone-throwers amen not the way that it usually is represented but you see we can't sit there what would what bothered David they put Saul's armor on him and and he stood there and he knew now some people have it because Saul was such a big guy and David was this little Ruddy guy that David knew that that armor was not for him because it was just too big he's dragging it around but the reality of it was the anointing of the Holy Spirit moved upon David to know that was not how I'm going to defeat Goliath is not by wearing someone else's Revelation I'm going to go out here and be led of the Holy Ghost and he followed that leadership he was led of the Holy Ghost he went out there with the very Simplicity what did he have the word amen he didn't have a theology he had a word those five little Stones God revealed that's all he needed Jesus Christ and faith and that was all he he needed to go take the battle my brother and sister we're going to face our Goliath we might as well be prepared not prepared with man's idea putting on an armor of I know more quotes than you do putting on the armor of no more scriptures than you do my brother and sister those were not a prerequisite for David to defeat Goliath amen it influenced him it helped him get in his right position to know where he stood but that wasn't the answer and I want to say this again this gospel is for warriors amen and if we're going to be wimps about it sorry sorry to put it that strong if we're going to be wimps amen then you're going to settle for less than complete Victory but if you come and say I was called by God before the foundation of the world to stand here as a warrior for this gospel and there is no shortcut the word will provide in me everything I need to face every battle I must face and I believe that Lord and I confess that and my brother and sister you will find yourself not pleased not happy not satisfied not settling for anything less than a complete Victory my let's remember we focus on the spiritual that's Eternal and the battle of the flesh is temporal now let me just go into Victory Day here amen now I want to read from the book of Revelation of Jesus Christ 15th chapter I want to read a portion the first four verses of the 15th chapter of the Book of Revelation and I saw another sign in heaven a great marvelous seven angels having seven last plagues for in them is filled up with the wrath of God and I saw it as where a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast see multifaceted here this is not just oh praise God I believe the message I got saved I got baptized no it's multifaceted there's when you have a victory there's another Victory before you you have a victory there there's another Victory before you don't approach this hey I got baptized I believe this the word of God but my life's been a disaster ever since my brother and sister you're approaching it wrong and then you approach it wrong you'll get the wrong result and then you'll live a half Victorious if there's such thing you'll live this modeled thing of what the message is and what it is and then you raise your children in that same atmosphere and then your children raise their children in the same atmosphere and Satan sits back and says it worked as long as they were just satisfied to be there our daughters long hair dressing correctly our sons real men oh that's just fine we've got it that's what the message done for me that's not what the message was about it's not a dress code it's a life it's a relationship and when we get our children and we ourselves get in that relationship my brother and sister the word says nothing will stand before us that's where we want our children to be at not conformers we want them to be victorious in a relationship with Jesus Christ amen where was I I saw another sign Heaven great and marvelous seven angels having seven last plagues were in them filled up with the wrath of God and I saw it was a sea of glass mingled with fire and then that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over his Mark and over the number of his name and stood on the sea of glass having harps of God and they sang the song of Moses a servant of God and the song of the Lamb sing great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints who shall not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou only Are Holy and All Nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest and if the Lord will I would like to take a text from that these are back to the prophet's words to call it vday or Victory Day as we symbolize that a complete Victory amen let's have a vday church let's not have a partial Victory you know we don't we don't do this any longer we don't do this any longer let's get a complete Victory which going to require a complete commitment on our part amen we have to press into that these people that are in the chapter that we just read had just gotten the victory I think that the word Victory is a great word in the English language it means that you have you have defeated the enemy and you've overcome and you're a Victor holding Victory oh my my brother and sister not holding a partial Victory amen I I'm not going to preach on it here today it' be a distraction but my brother and sister a complete realization versus a partial realization a complete Victory compared to a partial Victory amen there's no place for us to stop I remember one time reading a book of history and this was a man's opinion this was after tracing his family ancestry I thought it was kind of funny maybe you will he said yeah you know all those people that that stayed in Colorado Nebraska and Kansas didn't have the courage to go to Oregon he didn't see it as they stopped because it was a good place he saw that they stopped short it it wasn't called and this went on to his deal there his his revision of History you might say he said they didn't call it the Nebraska Trail they didn't call it the Kansas Trail it was the Oregon Trail and they stopped short of the goal because they decided this journey was too long too hard too laborious my brother and sister I thought it was funny his family now you know owned a huge chunk of the state of Oregon because we didn't stop on the Oregon Trail in Kansas we stopped on the Oregon Trail in Oregon and I I just thought it was a funny way to put it but I think it's representative this morning we are not the bride of Christ stopping short of the Sea of Crystal amen we're not stopping here just to say oh my my lifelong Church experience has been glorious we're not stopping till we're standing on the sea of Crystal Before the Throne of God in the presence of God worshiping God Almighty amen nothing short of that is going to satisfy the real believer and I hope that isn't too cutting my brother and sister but if you set your sight too low I'm asking you this morning as your brother in Jesus Christ live lift your vision up amen our vision is to be Before the Throne of almighty God nowhere else are we going to be satisfied as a real believer till we are standing there in the presence of almighty God Amen you are a Victor holding Victory and we sing songs and cheer in a victory and here we find that there was something these people had come to this sea of glass mingled with fire and they had gotten the victory over the Beast over his image over the mark and the letter of his name all these things they had gotten the victory over them and were Victor standing on the other side on the sea of glass mingled with fire singing the songs of praise to almighty God and that's why I believe with all my heart amen that we as a song service today just need to sing from our heart amen this is our practice ground to stand before God on the sea of Crystal and to praise His name and sing songs of praise let's not be half-hearted singers we're not going to go there to learn how to sing this is where God wants you and I to learn how to give praise through song this is where God wants you and I to learn how to lift our hands amen learn how to really truly Praise Him from our hearts I'm not being too hard am I amen hallelujah but you see we got to have a a vision of that Victory before we'll ever have the victory amen I think that's something we ought to praise the Lord for to have the vision even just the vision of the victory should be something to praise him but to have the victory itself the Fulfillment of the spoken word in your life over us that ought to be something that just ought to boil over in our life that we just say I just can't hold myself amen you see it takes every part or component of the word to truly have victory Victory this is why we can't come along here and say well I believe the message but I disagree with the prophet on this really my brother and sister that's becoming much more prevalent the prophet himself says that they won't deny those things they don't believe it but they won't deny it for appearance sake I won't go too far into it but not that far in the past come across people that say they believe the message and argue with the pastor over the quotes believing the quote is wrong are we conceptional Believers in principle we believe no my brother and sister we were called to be Believers amen we're called to be Believers a little story from a ship that sank many years ago this man was actually being a gentleman willing to sacrifice his life and he stepped aside he was a wealthy man he stepped aside from getting in a Lifeboat the people on the ship are telling him sir you're important get in the Lifeboat he stepped aside and said ma'am bring your children bring all of this here uh come get in the boat and and he stepped aside and they kept telling him a steward kept telling him sir the ship is sinking you're going to lose your life but my brother and sister an arrogant man with self-importance come and as the boat was settling in the water and going he brought his whole family and pushed them into the boat and and they released the boat and it went out and the boat was so overloaded that water slopped in and every person that that went into that Lifeboat drowned and the man is still on this ship that is sinking settling and he thought to himself my what have I done to them but then realization hit him I didn't take their life someone who didn't value their life took their life and he stood at the rail until the sea overwhelmed him and his family and people criticized that and said well if he cared about his family he would have got in that Lifeboat but you see he actually cared about others more than he cared about his own family and ironically as the vorte of the ship going down in the water swirling it swept his wife and two of his children to an empty Lifeboat floating in the end his family was saved all but his youngest child because his youngest child was unable to swim but you see my brother and sister this gospel is not to shove you out of the way so that they can to put them come out of the way so that you can this gospel is here to give Victory to each and every one of us if we're willing to receive it if we're willing to take a hold of it amen and we come to this place we're called to praise him can I have just another minute or two amen let's go right over here I'll as I said a minute ago here it takes every component of the word for us to have Victory brother Brown speaks of this give you a little Head Start might might be something we preach on a little deeper here perfect realization contrasted with partial realization my brother and sister we want perfect realization we don't want to just be able to sit here today and I hope this doesn't offend anybody we're not called to sit here today and say God sent a prophet and that's as deep as our revelation of this word goes God did not send a prophet so we could say God sent a prophet that should be a stated fact that needs no reinforcement God said I'll send you Elijah the prophet and we don't have to dig up scriptures and quotations and this and that to defend God's sending a prophet that was God's word we should just believe it amen amen now in the message hear you himm when God gets ready to do something he always has a witness of it I'm so glad today that we can look around before the coming of the Lord and see the witnesses of his appearing seeing the signs in the Church of the near approaching of the Lord Jesus Christ seeing it word by word fulfilled Can someone say Amen to that we're not looking for some super sign out here we're not looking for some that we hang our hat on we're looking for the word of God coming in our life changing you and I bringing us into favor with our Lord Jesus Christ building faith in us giving us a a a spirit and a vision of Victory amen not to sit back and say well what it is my brother and sister it's amazing that the world today interprets the scripture that the Believers are going to go through Armageddon well I'm sorry my brother and sister but the prophet of God come in very simple terms and brought it down and said no Joseph's wife was in the house and the world's like no no no we're serving God today but we're going to prove that we really love him later really no wonder the church is loose because they don't even view right now as a time to prove where they stand but you see by the word of God we stand here today and now is our time to prove I know this is a little crash a little blunt a little straightforward but I like how a minister put it he said no man in his right mind would marry a girl who is Unfaithful expecting her to prove she's faithful after she's married is that a little straightforward yeah a little straightforward amen but the time you prove your faithful is now not after the marriage he okay sorry about that if it was a bit much see the sign and near approaching seeing it word by word fulfilled even the last sign that was to be given to the church before the appearing of the Lord Jesus it's working in the church can we say that St all right here I I'll just let me cover this up here so we don't have to have too high expectations he's proving it right now not later now the last saying remember he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man look what the Sinners was doing in Sodom look what the angel the Lord did when he come down to Bear record of it watch what the Three Angels did all three of them look at the world today in its sin look at the church today in its condition like lot look at the called out Church having a struggle like Abraham was the man or the woman today that tries to live for God let me stop don't read no more any of you guys struggles ever wonder why you have struggles it's right here here's an answer the man or the woman today that tries to live for God has a struggle to keep on going you have to press into the kingdom of God and never was I'm a Christian and life's supposed to be easy amen it's a struggle Can someone say Amen it's a struggle my brother and sister God didn't say hey I I'm going to make it so easy for you oh they say but but he said he would make the Stony the rough way smooth before us yeah imagine what it would be if he hadn't amen scripture says it wouldn't be any flesh saved couldn't do it but God's Made A Way see don't view this struggle as I'm closing sister via will you come musicians don't view this struggle as a strange thing Saints you should view this as an integral part of what it is to serve God yeah we're still doing pretty well really do any of you live in a cave any of you had to Flee for Your Life to the mountains to live in a cave no we've actually got it quite easy 1 Peter 4:12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you take cheer God declared You Victorious you are victorious could I encourage you with these words just keep pressing into the kingdom just keep pressing it's not going to be easy but you'll do it and you'll overcome and you'll have a testimony that you can stand Before the Throne on the sea of Crystal and the Patriarchs and the prophets of old will set there in awe as you share your testimony how you overcome the age that you live in that's incredible my brother and sister it's going to be incredible remember the story of the Roman soldiers in the Dark Ages I don't mean to be crash but it's just the reality of the story they were forcing these Christians men women children to take all their clothes off they're standing on the ice they made them take their clothes off and they drove them to the center of the lake and they're out there hypothermia setting in falling one by one but not recanting their belief in Jesus Christ and that Roman soldier he looked and something stirred so deep within his heart for anyone to go through that this has to be true and he went and he started taking off all of his coats and his armor cloak and all of these things and they said what is wrong and he told them I believe then his comrades had no problem driving him out on the ice that he could suffer with them so that he could reign with them let that be our testimony we're willing to the press to the mark of the High Calling let press to the kingdom Hallelujah 871 [Music] Hallelujah two
