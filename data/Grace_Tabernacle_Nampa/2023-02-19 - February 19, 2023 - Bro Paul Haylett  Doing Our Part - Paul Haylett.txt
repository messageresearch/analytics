and just realized God in his Mercy is right here with us walking with us leading us guiding us thank you Lord for what you have done for us Lord we're going to look today Father this service right here today Lord to look to the things father that you desire to do for us right now Lord Jesus Lord we don't want to look over those in expectation of another day but Lord we're here to say thank you thank you Father for salvation Lord for the washing of the water of the word the blood that has come continually Upon Us father just cleansing us Lord making us ready father we thank you for that ask for your blessings of those who are not here today Father just ask you to touch each and every one Lord father you know circumstance Lord you know jobs and you know Hearts father Lord we committed all to you in the name of Jesus and the precious name of Jesus we claim it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen just want to remember the grams sir just having a little time remember our sister April work schedules you know one of the trickiest things that Satan never did in this day and age was to try and turn the world into a 24-hour a day he took an distracted it it now becomes a world where jobs and different things just require us to you know as it were participate but as we speak today I just trust that we can just look into this and and catch a little bit amen I want to bring uh prayer request brother mellow I have not met him I'm going to try to this coming week see if I can get together with him um they're refugees I guess it'd be the status to put that and uh they are in my correspondence with them they're living in a motel and uh doesn't sound like they're being able to expand out as it were to find a home they don't have a car um so we just want to remember brother Mello and family in prayer God would just come on their behalf they've expressed if they can find a way to to come to church uh that they would desire to do that I bring greetings to you from the Ashdown family and uh just texting a little bit with brother Jason this morning and so uh we just share that greeting and um I don't know how many are going to be a bible study this evening amen I think our number is going to be small and and brother Sergey has offered to host the Bible study at his house and that way the children will have a little bit of a place to kind of move away from the Bible study so let's just make that official that Bible studies at five o'clock at Brother sergey's house and I don't know if Sister Yulia knows that or not but I guess she knows it now amen so um let's we'll just take up this offer from our brother Sergey sister Dorcas shared such a lovely testimony with me um that um we had prayer requests and we've been praying about that for Ella's eyes um for several months now um that you know the doctor's concerned her eyes being but sister Dorka shared that Ella's eyes are now improving to 75 percent and uh my brother and sister I say thank you Lord for that let's just thank the Lord for that so let's not stop praying until her eyes are 100 percent amen we serve a God that does the supernatural there shouldn't even be a flicker of doubt in our minds that God will do this amen you know I I just I don't want to go into a slightly different subject but just in my studies coming across these different things that brother Branham said and he says you know if we would just believe that in all sincerity it would happen right now now insincerity my brother and sister would mean that part of our sincerity would have to be rooted in faith amen not just a whim not just a wish not a hope but rooted in faith and us a hundred percent believing that I say we have needs in this assembly amen would we just raise as it were our level our commitment just a little bit raise that up that we could come to a place that God would come and would honor every need that we have as a body of Believers amen we're not over here just hoping that God will do this but believing absolute God has already promised and he will deliver amen hallelujah and so as we just go turn into our our thought today I want to just speak to you on doing our part and uh so in this it's kind of rooted in a uh another thought bleeding over in my studies but if we'll turn to Matthew 22 1-4 uh we'll just uh take this portion of scripture and draw our main thought from from this Matthew 22 1-4 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables aren't you glad today that God revealed the parable to us we're not sitting here in a question what does it all mean but God has opened his word to us that the parable has actually moved from Parable to life and we recognize it in life the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are Bid and behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage Heavenly Father we just ask for your blessings this day father in this service Lord for many are not with us father traveling or feeling ill we just pray Lord that you would just reach out to every single one father and just touch their hearts their bodies strengthen them Father in spirit and Lord may they wherever they're at today just be able to Feast upon the word of God Amen to come into your presence Lord that the word would come and bring life to them let it be the substance father that strengthened them today as we move forward father to finish this race that you have called us to we ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Hallelujah I like this as this come forth out of verse 4. to recognize the um the time that we're in my brother and sister it's not a time of a preparation as it were it's not a time to look far off in the future but as Matthew 22 as Jesus is speaking he says then I the the the dinner has been prepared the fatlings are killed all things are ready come unto the marriage now we're not trying to make a point for a timeline today my brother and sister we're wanting you to just understand the calling that God has placed into lives it is there the great invitation amen we look in Matthew 22 14 and it says for many are called but few are chosen and as we'll look at this and realize my brother and sister that the the calling it is there we'll look around the world today there are many people who are drawn to the things of the lord they're drawn to this scripture they're Drawn to Life and there's something that stirs within their heart but my brother and sister it is there in that that we recognize by this scripture that few are chosen and sometimes it comes down that people would say why did God not move or why did God not do this or that but you'll find often times that God lays something into the heart of humanity and some are that that uh anointing that comes upon them causes them to press in more than others and you'll see my brother and sister then in the whole Natural Life we'll find that there are those who are have dedicated their whole life to certain callings whether it be something of the nature of a missionary or a pastor or a a help or whatever it would be in the church or a scientist or whatever it might be and they just pour themselves in it and others they kind of work at it or at the fringes but never completely sold out to what this would cost them to to become this desire or this uh unction that is in them and so it is at time my brother and sister that the uh all things are ready and I I believe that right now we could honestly say all things are ready there is manifestations that need to take place there is uh uh part of the word that must still be fulfilled and maybe I could put it like this maybe it's even me that has got to be perfected a little bit more uh you know not to throw it off on somebody else like when you get ready we'll go in a Rapture maybe it's me that needs a little more refining but it is is that we press into that and it is we either choose my brother and sister the whole thing just studying in the message brother Brown talking about free moral agency you look at that and realize my brother and sister that even in the garden God did not come after the garden and say I'll give free more agency that the very establishment of the garden there was free moral agency and so it is in that there was a desire my brother and sister and we don't need to go into it this morning we all understand that but you see there had to be a desire to live what Jesus Christ has called us to live there it can't be from Form and Function I don't sound like judgmental or legalist but we look around us and we have quite a long history in this Valley uh amongst the Holiness people of knowing them acquainted with them rubbing shoulders from even my childhood and Jerry and I early marriage all the way to this day and my brother and sister we can look and see a slow but steady decline in the desire to live a Holiness type life and there's compromise in all of these things coming and we'll see this we could kind of I don't know we could make points but I don't think they're necessary and we see how there's been this steady decline and uh so as things are coming to be ready there's called to a marriage and my brother and sister you know there would be different outlooks on this and I'm not trying to make a Doctrine but my brother and sister the marriage in vow form has already taken place are you with me you say but we we haven't come to that my brother and sister understand it in The Vow the prophet of God come along and that's why he said we need to teach our young people from the word of God that this is not a game it's not something to play around at because the vow has power to it it's a binding force and so here we are my brother and sister in the hour that we're living in and we have not seen a Rapture yet but the Rapture is taking place are you with me amen it's not an event as a snapping of a finger but it is a catching away and God is catching his people out of this world that we live in and slow but sure is transforming them and bringing them into a place that they are no longer a creature of this Earth or its atmosphere but they're creatures of heaven and I say thank you Lord this might sound presumptuous because we all make mistakes but my brother and sister I'm here to declare to you this morning that we are closer to creatures of Heaven than we are creatures of Earth amen God is catching us away pulling us up out of the atmosphere that makes up this world today and so it's there as in verse 20 uh 14 I mean chapter 22 verse 14 many are called but few are chosen and I want to make a declaration this morning I believe we are called and chosen amen that we are not just here to abide for a season until we become weary in well-doing and Fade Away into the sunset to be a distant memory my brother and sister I believe but we are in a time that God having chosen us is going to Manifest this choosing in a greater fashion each and every day but I've got to let him amen I've got to stand still long enough to be Washed by the Water of the word I've got to stand still long enough to be corrected if we're not careful we just get so busy go go go with life I've been there I can talk with authority but it is there my brother and sister at this calling and this choosing that God is changing our nature changing our desires it is no longer as it would be just to be successful now I want you to look for a moment this morning just how blessed we are brother and sister truly we are amongst the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth today but you say but brother Paul there's some that are sick that's just an Earthly thing amen there's financial troubles that's just an Earthly thing my brother and sister there's all kinds of things that we focus on they're just Earthly things we get so caught up in this as though maybe this is a sign of what you know is a state of our spiritual world because we're having difficulties my brother and sister nowhere does it say that we'd be free from difficulties but what he did say is that we would be victorious in Jesus Christ amen the Earthly things if they are enough to distract us then by free moral agency we also have chosen God help us today to make the right choice not to be choosing the things that are Earthly sensual but to choose the things that are spiritual and uplifting drawing us into the presence of God I'll just Sidetrack for just a moment the Rich Young Ruler is such a to me the more I read it the more I study it the more phenomenal it is to me because my brother and sister it is almost a basic human instinct to try to gain and gather more a little more of this a little more of that and that is fine if God blesses you and you can buy a little bigger house or a little nicer car and do all these things there's no problem that is not a sign of a spiritual Decay but when that becomes our Focus there's the sign of spiritual decay amen but you look at how God is doing and we are coming and have been offered free moral agency every single day of Our Lives but we can come and you say but I've made a mistake or two brother Paul hey don't you thank the Lord for the blood today amen it's come down it's washed us from every mistake now mistakes are not what defines us amen it's where we stand when it's all said and done amen when it's all finished and we are blessed my brother and sister God didn't just call us to be part of a movement amen you can fly around the world as we just had to approach here a few weeks ago you know to go to Israel and then go on to South Africa and visit several churches in South Africa my brother and sister you can look around and and you just go around the Earth as it were and you get off a plane and someone picks you up and they take you and you start to interact and in just a little bit you feel like you've known this person forever but you could do that if you're a Baptist you can do that if you're Nazarene we're not called to a movement we're part of a movement but we weren't called to the movement amen amen we're not just part of a church it's human nature somebody says where do you go to church well I'm part of Grace well that's good nice identity but my brother and sister that's not really Who We Are Grace is a group of people that have been called and chosen amen it is not by accident God places us around the earth into positions or uh to occupy a place and have friends and rub shoulders as it were but my brother and sister that wasn't what God called us to amen he called us to the word and the word is what brings the family together it's a word that brings the body together it's a word that brings friends together amen it's not us Gathering and then trying to find the word it's just exactly the opposite amen but I want you to think about this how it is to be invited my brother and sister there are things that I call General invitations a general invitation would be to someone maybe you're halfway around the world and I would say this I try to be careful not to I would say if you're ever in Idaho brother come preach for us the odds of him ever being in Idaho are somewhere so close to zero that's a general invitation but when you have a real invitation that's when you say brother can you come I don't know the dates but can you pray and can you give us an answer and commit yourself to come and preach for us that is a specific invitation and the world today my brother and sister takes John 3 16 and says we have been given the invitation but I want to tell you my brother and sister God got a lot more specific than that God come and said I have personally given you an invitation to come oh it's not just a general invitation my brother and sister because the word itself says that already God knew that many would not accept the invitation would not believe it enough to press into it now when I say believe it enough to press into it my brother and sister if it is a plane ticket and a brother says I'll come but he wakes up the day he's supposed to get on the plane and just says I don't feel like flying today that he didn't really fully accept the fullness of the invitation because when you accept the fullness the impatient my brother and sister you wake up unfortunately four or five hours early and you pack and repack and pack and repack and you scour the house from end to end ceiling to floor making sure you have everything you need and when you can't pick up the suitcase you unpack and pack it again and there's something there that you use like I'm gonna go I'm gonna be a part of what God is doing I'm going to speak and God's gonna answer amen and that's our heart's desire reminds me of a story once that was shared and these were two brothers the wives standing there so it wasn't anything behind someone's back and one brother says yeah my wife and I going to Hawaii I ask and he kinda turns his head a friend of mine if him and his wife wanted to come but they never pursued going the other brother looks at the floor and goes I didn't think you were serious is this the kind of invitation we've been given today that we would sit here today and say well I wasn't sure that the King was serious when he invited me to the wedding supper but what it would be that we would just have a absolute unrelenting faith in the word that has come to us and if the invitation has been expressed I'm gonna accept it I'll tell you what my brother and sister that makes you think that if anybody ever looked you in the face and says hey go to Hawaii with us maybe you should just say yes work out the details later but to not believe it was serious enough to show up this is what the scripture is sharing here the invitation was given but they never considered it serious enough to show up therefore the invitation was actually null and void to them now the word was spoken are you with me the word was spoken the invitation was spoke right you might say out into the ether but there had to be someone there that was sincere and believed it enough to say I accept that and obviously they didn't we have received a personal invitation from the King Can someone say yes yes I've received a personal invitation I didn't receive an invitation of an evangelist of a pastor of a message as it were my brother and sister I received a personal invitation from Jesus Christ amen him speaking to me lip to ear and I am here to say yes Lord yes Hallelujah you say well brother Paul what is this invitation well I tell you how the invitation was delivered right here in the word we didn't even know that we would be of quality of gentry enough to go to the King's house to a marriage supper but the invitation did not have any place to fill out to say I'm qualifying all it had if you would understand in the modern day that we live in a place to RSVP in other words your signature is sufficient enough to claim the reservation of the invitation Lord help us Lord help us the invitation's been given my brother and sister and I think too many times we're looking for some greater thing so holy spirit moves through the church maybe the Lord just moves upon your heart to lift a hand do we accept the invitation or decline it sometimes the preaching of the word stirs to maybe find an altar do we accept or decline the word asks for more of our time do we accept or decline more heartfelt worship my brother and sister I think sometimes we get a little confused of what worship really is it's it's lifting hands it's singing songs it's giving praise but we can do all of that mechanically real worship is from the very depths of one's soul giving praise to God will we accept or decline we can put it on the basis of I work hard I'm tired it's hard to do that it is but my brother and sister it's hard to look across the gulf and look and see Lazarus laying in the bosom and we are realizing we missed an opportunity that's what I would call hard the Rich Young Ruler my brother and sister is he's there looking and realizing a beggar who laid on the streets with sores that he himself could have solved that problem but unwilling because he didn't receive or accept that invitation I know I've shared this with the church many times but I believe it with all of my heart that the Rich Young Ruler in that situation my brother and sister if he would have simply answered Jesus and said I will sell everything I have I'll give it to the poor and I will follow you my brother and sister Gibson uh callings are without repentance and I don't believe the Rich Young Ruler could have outgiven God he would he would have sold something and God would have blessed him somewhere else and he would have by that natural ability been given become a conduit to do things for the gospel but all he could think about is if I have to sell my nice house my nice cars my airplane this that and the other all everything I've worked for I can't do that but what he didn't realize is God was just asking him surrender amen Just Surrender just give yourself up that's all I need you to do I already put these gifts in you I'm not stripping the gifts away from you right gifts and callings we always just look in the spiritual but my brother and sister it applies a natural typing spiritual and that gift was right there all the time God's not going to strip that gift from him God wanted free let me get let me stop here get my mind right God wanted permission to use the gift that he had gave him he wanted permission and if he would have said Lord whatever it is it's yours he would have still been able to live a good life and imagine the blessings that he had done and he would not have ended up in the Gulf looking across and seeing Lazarus laying in the bosom of Abraham wouldn't have happened but you see it come down my brother and sister that he had a personal invitation from the King and I want you to know that in one sense that was even more personal than your invitation and I only say that because it was literal face to face an invitation doesn't get any more personal than that it can come in a nice embossed envelope with all kinds of Scrolls and all kinds of whatever Swirls and whatever on it and you can open that up and your heart pitter-patters because you're invited to this wedding you're invited to this you're invited to that but my brother and sister nothing gets more important and personal than to stand face to face with the king of kings and be invited but by the word my brother and sister we have to understand the appearing and the coming of Christ and we understand my brother and sister that he has literally stood in front of you and I and invited us to a higher life invited us to a higher calling it is not my brother and sister just some thought out there in the in the ethernet but it is there a personal invitation and the word has become our invitation now look when the word comes I think you can say Amen to this I can I don't want to be too demonstrative to you but when the word comes it stirs up things we never knew was in US I remember a man one time saying praise God I'm living such a life I haven't had to repent for years over anything and I'm like well I'll tell you what on this teeter-totter of life I am on the absolute opposite end and I am repenting every day from everything from wanting well anyway we won't go there amen but now on this end of the teeter-totter and now you're on this end saying praise God the message has put you in a position you don't ever have to repent my brother and sister all I can do is fall back and the prophet of God said you should repent every single day amen so it's there then I I don't know what to say I don't know the man's life I just remember being stunned speechless by your statement such as that but I tell you my brother and sister the word when it comes stirs up things in us that we never knew was there let me take it on one side here that is the word has come and dredges all these little things out of our life that God says this is not going to be any good to you on the other side so we're going to take this out of your life and then on that we could really focus a lot but you're with me amen God dealing with us cleaning it out the spring is boiling all of the sticks and the trash out and on the other side my brother and sister would say I never thought that I would ever be doing this or be in this position or whatever and God sowing things that was in us that we never knew was there gifts that he wanted us to offer to the assembly to offer to him Gifts of helps and Gifts of service and Gifts of preaching the word or leading songs or being a prayer Warrior wow one of the most understated gifts that God has put in the church is the service of a prayer Warrior everybody's looking all we'll look at their position look at their position but what about the position that's behind closed doors and no one ever sees that but it's Faithfully served oh Hallelujah amen I think we can say Amen to this this morning that it serves up a hunger inside of us that we never knew existed cleaning house I think it's funny don't take this no one especially my wife but I think it's funny Human Nature we live in our houses don't we can a sister say Amen but you're going to have a lot of company and suddenly a whirlwind goes through the house talking this there and that there and these things here closet we clean house when the Holy Ghost comes and says you know what I'm taking you in a rapture that reaction that we have my brother and sister is he's coming we start going through the house and we start cleaning up the house amen it's just a human nature it's what God made us to be that way in the closer we get to the coming of the Lord my brother and sister is the more that it means to us amen it calls us a start with a little list of things and you'll find that in God's economy God's program nothing's too small for him to correct nothing's too small for him to sweep it you know the old phrase and literally I had a grandmother that was this way amen she would kick up one corner of the rug with a toe and if it was just a feather from the feather pillow or whatever yes sweep it under the rug hello yeah are any of us experienced and sweeping it under the road I should apologize a day or two goes by I would have apologized a few more days I would apologize if they would apologized a few months they deserved it what are we doing lifting it up with our toe sweeping it under the rug and then God comes along and says I want to take a good look at your house and because we are Sons and Daughters of God we're like Lord forgive me I've been sweeping stuff under the Rock father I didn't really mean to and I knew it wasn't right help me Lord and we clean these things out and our lives change the prophet of God said sometimes these things there's not healings there's not deliverances there's not all of these things because there's just little things now we can put that as unconfessed sins my brother and sister but that sounds so harsh so we're going to be polite this morning and just say you've got a lot of feathers under the rug it's not even dirt it's feathers but it has the same effect of hindering or life that we're not moving forward to see the supernatural now look at this it causes us to clean the littlest of things and you know our desire to be immersed my brother and sister is the same desire to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is this same desire to be immersed in the washing of the water of the word every single day in other words a Believer comes to a time in his life that he wants to be baptized because he's going to let the world know and let the Lord Jesus know I'm going to serve you Lord and that is that same anointing my brother and sister that comes at 12 years old 14 25 40 50 70 90. it's the same anointing that comes on there I want to be immersed I want to be put down underneath this I want to testify I'm serving you Lord and the word of God my brother and sister comes washes over us immerses us in the presence of God and then suddenly the little specks and the little feathers and the little dirt under the rug starts to fade because we're cleaning it up now are we making sense enough for you to follow me this morning in the sermon things that are to be brother Brown says now how am I going to teach them algebra when they won't even learn their always believe Christ I mean ABCs when they won't even do the common thing see the natural thing how are you going to tell them high things when you won't even start when you want to get on top the ladder before you hit the first and I'll finish this for him rung and now look at the Spirit of the world we live in let me just deviate all off a little bit parents worked for 30 years raise their children finally have a decent house and drive a nice car we have a generation now that is also causing this influx of debt that is binding and hindering people because they get out of college they get offered a good job they go buy a house bigger than mom and dad ever had and they drive new cars and then they call Dave Ramsey and say Dave Ramsey I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year and I'm broke that's just a natural example o children parents there's nothing wrong with being frugal hmm we could get in technicalities and realize you go buy a brand new car and before you get home it's a used car you turn around drive it back to the dealer they'll offer you ten thousand less dollars than that what you paid driving it off the lot and so we look at this now I want to bring this back into a spiritual element that it is there my brother and sister how that people would come and they get and they they get this and they come and they get saved overnight they're an authority on how to live the message now I want you to understand the disappointment they feel when they fall down the first time you notice I didn't say when they fall down it's just the first time because what God is doing is seasoning us this is nothing don't misunderstand this is not against him spiritually or as an individual this is the journey that God is taking us on and as it is we are being trained my brother and sister a free moral agency training that when we fall down God says now what are you going to do what are you gonna do and we've seen many people get up and walk away they said well if this is what it's like serving God I'm not going to do it but there's something of a predestinated seed that when they fall down and the is there Satan's saying yep see you can't do it the predestinated seed gets up and says thank you Lord for the lesson thank you Lord I'm going to do my best and I'm going to press on and they start moving forward and the devil wants to show them and make them it look as though they're not real Christians but I'm telling you my brother and sister this is the process that God brings so they want to get on top the ladder before you hit the first that's the reason you fall see they're putting this is nature of humanity they're putting themselves up here where they cannot support it with the word and character it's not enough just to have word my brother and sister many people have carried the word and failed miserably we need the word and we need character and in here I'm using the word character but we need the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost has promised to purge us Amen to walk to burn out all the dross and that is what molds a character into Sons and Daughters of God that we couldn't stand there should be no shame my brother and sister in US walking and having things that we stumble over but we want to appear amen we want to appear as though we have this Firm Foundation so then as we look at this see I Never Promised You today and make you all shout and be happy begin at the bottom and climb right on up as God leads you up see cope your life and ever follow every bit of the word that God has ordained for you to do now this word cope my brother and sister is to deal effectively so let me just read it to you that way amen begin at the bottom climb right on up as God leads you up see deal effectively with your life and ever follow every bit of the word that God ordained for you to do amen don't just say well praise God and toss it off to the side take it and deal effectively reading an article the other day of a very large I think it's a Fortune 100 company and they were having young men and young women whose resumes were perfect they had Masters and phds in business and their resumes were perfect that they should be able to perform this job and literally this company the HR Manager for this company was saying we have these people and we realize the universities are not teaching them what is necessary at this level of business like graduates from University be given positions to manage things that require the management skill to deal with hundreds of millions of dollars which reminds me if you ever see hundreds of millions of dollars you don't know what to do with it just start subtracting the zeros off the end and if you can't manage a hundred dollars don't dare try managing a hundred million and finally this company says we're no longer hiring from resumes we interview people and we evaluate them what oh catch this word what is their character and we found that we can teach them what we need to teach them if their character is solid wow all them tens and hundreds of thousands they spent to get a masters and a PhD means nothing if you don't have wow I thought it was an interesting article went Holmen looked at things around our house and was going to take some zeros off and realized we were already there hmm now think how that God we should behave ourselves and act like Christians our conducts should be like Christians because we are aliens here this is what I was referring to earlier this is not our home no we're just put here temporarily now some people's temporary is a little more temporary than others I'm telling you my brother and sister I'll speak openly of it I still I've watched part of brother Gideon's funeral this morning and set my office and cried a man with so much I'm going to use the word talent I don't mean it that way but so much to give to the body of Believers has such an impact and at 62 years old or three what is it four gone a huge void so some of us temporary is more temporary than others temporary some temporary might be 90 years old brother Bob sister Joanne but it still comes down it's still temporary this world is not our home this is not what God called us to do God help us that our Focus could move amen my brother and sister you don't go spend your life's fortune on a house you're going to live in temporarily you spend it on what matters now look at this this is not our home we're just put here temporarily we've got to go every one of us tonight now think if God in his Mercy has the mother before the little baby is born is craving some vitamin the mother's word speaks forth dad I want cantaloupe you Brothers will know what brother Brown is talking about I want cantaloupe or I want watermelon I want something or another it's out of why he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as it can be see he'll do everything that he's able to do to get it how much more Abel or I like that I love brother branham's English how much more abeler is he to get it he's a Creator now think how able he is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live oh how much more abler hallelujah amen there is something in US calls to live amen amen this is that invitation from the word my brother and sister God didn't have to come down and roll it out and pamper us all he had to do is put forth and what was already placed in US starts to respond to that amen because there's something we want and we want to live amen there is something in us that calls to do right then God will call somebody on the platform or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out my brother and sister we got to get away from this babysitting Believers that we're doing where we're going to Pat him on the back and tell them now you know God's going to take this away from you someday how about there be a believer that would stand and cry out and say Lord deliver me from this I need deliverance from a spirit I need deliverance from a addiction or something I need it Lord not be given an opportunity well just whenever patty cake along but we're coming to A Time my brother and sister the clock is ticking down we're coming to a Time the games should be over we should be able to stand and say Lord I need deliverance and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna step away until I have what I need Lauren now you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me now my brother and sister we don't speak down every one of us has and we'll face in our life times that we will come to situations like this that God's bringing us what is it a test a free moral agency a time what do you want more you want loud to see a more or do you want me more just as he stood there before those temples there amen the headwaters of the Jordan River and he speaks to Peter and there's the backdrop of all these temples and he's looking at Peter and he's saying Peter who do you say I am Peter didn't look have to look up there well they offer nicer fellowships a bigger Church a choir they offer they offer no sir something down in the heart Jesus didn't want to know what everybody else said he wanted to know what we say he wants to know today what we're going to say about our circumstance in life you say brother Paul my circumstance is pretty hard and maybe I would say yes brother it's pretty hard but what is it you want what is the desire of your heart and if you want deliverance from that then cry out Lord circumcise me amen circumcise me from this Lord I want Deliverance God take it away not pastor not someone else speak to the Lord why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone to prepare you got to be a real word bride of Christ now I want to put this two ways my brother and sister there's things that we have that we will not need on the other side God's asking us to free will allow him to take this away from us and there are things that we need on the other side that God is here Desiring to give to us more than we even desire to have it think about it you say well brother Paul life is hard I agree it is hard it is hard but how much harder it is without the full manifestation of Jesus Christ Life as a Christian can we say Amen Life as a Christian is hard but my brother and sister it's much harder without him much harder it looks like these people have an easy time but I tell you what my brother and sister I won't go into this it's kind of grisly but I'm telling you people think oh if I just had a few million dollars all my problems would be over I tell you if you had a few million dollars your problems would just be starting amen now this sounds harsh but there's a lot of Believers my brother and sister that would crash and burn if they suddenly had a few million dollars and God knows our nature you say brother Paul are you judging them no I'm just looking at character statement of facts we're just looking at character my brother and sister and it comes down that it is a situation this might sound a little harsh forgive me if it does but here again if you can't manage that hundred dollar bill why would you ask God to give you tens of thousands or Millions hmm stewardship stewardship wow I think we'll just move on real quick here you see God didn't give us a manufactured response Saints every response that comes from misunderic daughter of God that's anointed by the word of God is an organic response and there's some things abilities right that are brought out by the word the Deep calling as the prophet of God showed us the Deep calling there's a deep responding and if there's nothing in there to respond to the call then what are we going to do we can manufacture but brother and sister the Deep calls to the predestinated it may take some time right we look out and see people that don't seem to be living right and people don't you know they kind of say well they must not be no my brother and sister don't judge them just let God do the work amen what the word will do is come down upon them a word here and a word there right this line upon line precept upon precept Works in a multitude of ways not just one singular way and they'll be out here my brother and sister and it might be out of respect that they'll bow their head when somebody prays for the food and there'll be something that was said in that prayer that registers with them and then they go on as though nothing is happening and people are like woe unto us our children or siblings our parents or whatever it might be but God is working and he'll be stocking up that word in such a fashion and one day it starts to affect them amen I want to get into this uh much this way but you know my brother shared this certain uh natural pill that he takes it helps your blood circulation and uh he even gave me a bottle that's not super expensive I don't think but you know he says no Paul you know you take this I believe in it enough I'm going to give this to you and then he says now look hey Paul um I'm not buying you another bottle I'm not giving you no more of this but it might take more than just what that time is or that one bottle to affect you but it works he's standing there in front of me personal testimony it works okay good good it works I'm patiently waiting for it to work are you with me patiently waiting I know it's something we don't often do is pray for patience but God help us that when these things start to build line upon line amen that we don't say well I spoke to him about this and they didn't respond no don't worry about it just come and when God anoints you pile something else on top of that and then one day something starts to stir in their heart and they get tired of being unhappy amen they get tired of feeling lonely they get tired of feeling like they're living in a vacuum and one day something happens amen and it starts to affect them and then they start to have a response to the word and I don't know if this will go out and I don't mean any ill by this but maybe I'll just censor the names but there's been a young sister she's no longer young got children growing up and getting married that has been away from the word of God for years now and people are like well you know she's a preacher's daughter when's she gonna get her life right my brother and sister there was a testimony it's in God's hands it's in God's time and the time has come and she gave her heart back to the Lord and then the naysayer said is it real God didn't give you a title of judging whether it's real or not God gave us the title of believer oh let that be manifested from us I'm a Believer maybe they're in a rocky place and they haven't shed all the habits but I believe maybe they're in a more mature place but still have something I believe maybe they're coming into another position and the word is opening for them and they don't quite unders I believe God didn't offer us a selective unbelief option amen it may take time and you say brother Paul are you confident yes I am I'm talking about real Believers because the word said it can't return void amen just let the word cast The Bread on the water let the word go let the word do the work that the word is supposed to do I can't do it you imagine if God give us an ability to just bring everyone in we would be spending our last dime on airline tickets flying wherever our family was at and we would be pulling them in and pulling them in and pulling them in and we wouldn't care because they would be serving God but God says You cast your bread you put your prayers before the throne my word cannot return void amen we've got to do our part my brother and sister and our part is not to condemn our part is to live amen Hallelujah oh and when it starts to affect them they start the prophet of God said paraphrasing this the word will never lead you away from the word aren't you glad amen let's do our part amen amen I encourage you Saints feed on the word let this Living Word change us yes sir amen boldly pursue as our brother Stephen these aren't his exact words but a foundation he laid let's boldly pursue the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen amen now look I'm going to touch on something that might seem a little bit judgmental but I don't believe it to be judgmental in the news if you follow anything at all there's been a great Revival at a college back east now my brother sister Webster's definition of a Revival is a comeback Reviving again bringing them back to something what will they come back to now don't take this judgmental what will they come back to is this of God only time will tell what will it produce only time will tell if you watch the video you see everything that we would consider wrong about worship the clothes young men that are there with their I don't know when time changed Saints but you know if you roll your bowl Cap you're out of fashion now you got to wear your ball cap with the brim perfectly flat and that little sticker that's on the bill that says a genuine whatever hat has to stay on there you can never take that off and they're standing there in their Sports their tank tops the young men with their hats everything that's contrary to us there can't be anything good there some of their leadership talking about how a Triune God the father has come and stirred them by the spirit and everything we're just like what but one thing I want to remind you if there is one son or daughter of God that the fire gets lit and God puts an unction of a deep coin and that goes out we can be critical we're message Believers we know the word we've been taken back truth truth we can take it back to the Bible we can dice it up and we can put it all back in its place but my brother and sister God works in ways beyond our understanding do we call it a Revival in the sense they would call it a Revival probably not but if there be just one son or daughter of God that finds himself standing in that Auditorium with hands lifted saying forgive me Lord I need you Lord Jesus my brother and sister God said it would be ten thousand worlds worth but to balance this we also realize that they would come out of the scripture that there would come a time of worshiping of Satan believing they're worshiping God that's hard see it's not even me that's being harsh here this is just the word but I tell you my brother and sister lest I would patty cake this thing let us make sure that we are not worshiping something besides what we believe we're worshiping let us make sure that we are worshiping a one true and living God our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah you see this revival my brother and sister one last comment about this revival if this revival is genuine it will lead these young people back to the word and if our Revival are we having a Revival come on I'm not trying to trick you are we having a Revival if we're not we better go find a Revival because this is God's word calling us back to the word amen this is his word calling us back to him we should be having a Revival every single day it shouldn't have to have a banner in front of the church and highlights and flyers in the neighborhood it shouldn't be advertised on the internet it shouldn't have to be done it should be burning in the hearts of Sons and Daughters of God every single day revive Me O Lord bring me back to my rightful position I was in you before the foundation of the world I was placed here in this day not my residence but just place here for a period of time and Lord I want to go back and you say I want to go back lord I don't want to stay here I want to go back where I come from want to go back in your presence oh Hallelujah sister Ruth if you'll come and the sermon doors in a door a sheep has wool that's the only thing it has it it can't manufacture that wool we're not asked to manufacture the spirit of the fruit of the spirit but to Bear the Fruit of the Spirit see one is external one is internal and as long as it's a sheep it'll bear amen aren't you glad saints that we can lift a hand today and say thank you Lord I will manufacture no no bear I will bear the fruit of the spirit I will bear the very word of God is going to come right back out of me it's not all about what is put into me but it is also what comes back out of me I don't have to manufacture the glands and everything in it is sheep it'll make wool because the inside of him has the glands and the adrenaline and all this stuff it takes to make wool and when you are a Christian you'll cope hmm yes do we remember what cope is I just want to make sure I get it right amen I want to put this back to you well I just passed over it I want to deal effectively with the word think about that when you deal effectively with the word is when you do the word it is not me dealing with the word it's actually the word dealing with me to bring the word manifest it's never been us it will never be us it's him but we have to do our part God called us to worship Him God called us to serve him God called us to take the word and eat the book amen didn't ask you you know to go find some spiritual tongues he didn't ask you to go find some way to get around this he asked you to eat the book Lord help us oh we even in the things that are hard can we say sometimes it's hard Saints amen even when it's hard just keep eating the book Hallelujah I use that little analogy about that Nitric or whatever acid stuff that expands your blood vessels supposed to help your your blood pressure go down and and whatnot that it's just kind of this natural thing and and you know and it takes time got high blood pressure I'm gonna go to the doctor here in about 10 minutes I think I'll take one of these pills I haven't taken one in a month but I think I'll take one right now and by the time I get to the doctor's office surely I'll have good blood pressure no my brother and sister eat the book every single day you say but I'm trying to serve the Lord and I don't seem to be changing how often do you eat the book eat the book every single day and it will change you I can guarantee you'll cope with the word I don't care what anybody else says you don't have to work up nothing bring down nothing pull pump up you're a Christian you just automatically bear the fruit of the spirit see see and that's the way it is amen see Hallelujah I'll tell you what my brother and sister there's times I don't feel very Victorious there might even times my voice says I'm not Victorious but God always brings some form or some fashion to remind us that we're not supposed to speak the devil's language so we stop and say okay if I'm saying then I can't do it I can't live it I can't that's not your language that's the devil's language what we got to do is stop and say you know what I got this invitation and I I don't mean to imply anybody have to response or anything but I'm just going to put it this way we got our invitation are we going to respond or not that's what it comes down to that are we going to respond or not Lord help me help me Lord to respond Hallelujah amen I'll just cut off a little bit of this here it'll be fine amen let's sing that song I believe it's number 88 brother Isaac let go and let God have his wonderful way amen let's just stand and Worship the Lord before we dismiss I want to once again just remind you we'll meet at brother Sergey and sister Julia's house five o'clock let go and let God have his wonderful way [Music] his way are

this father let's just recognize that's our job [Music] help me Lord to stay in step with your word help me Lord to stay in Step as it were with the bride of Christ she was the manifestation of the
