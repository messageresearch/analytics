[46:50] special greeting to brother Terry's
[46:53] sister Shelly and the boys and just um

[47:08] heart you just Rejoice my sister Alice I
[47:12] don't know there's not enough age
[47:13] separating us for to be like a mother to
[47:16] me so I guess I have to claim her as a
[47:18] big sister and uh just have a very
[47:21] special fondness in my heart for sister
[47:23] Alice
[47:24] please remember Sister Andrea she's in
[47:27] Liberia
[47:28] and she's on a medical Mission and
[47:30] they're doing cataract surgeries and uh
[47:33] certain countries I guess certain
[47:35] conditions I don't know a lot of factors
[47:37] in there uh she shared a little
[47:40] testimony that was shared with us that
[47:43] it's almost like she's done as many
[47:45] exams in just a few days that she's done
[47:48] over a vast expanse of time there's so
[47:51] much need there so you know our sister
[47:55] Andrea has a testimony isn't it good
[47:58] God's put Witnesses in our midst amen
[48:01] someone wants to talk about healing
[48:03] we've got a sister that we call our
[48:05] sister who can stand up and say God not
[48:08] only has healed me once he's healed me
[48:10] multiple times and he's on the scene and
[48:13] that is a testimony God gave her and who
[48:15] knows who she'll be able to share that
[48:17] with there on this medical Mission and
[48:21] so that brings me also our sister April
[48:23] we know her heart she would long to be
[48:25] in the house of God today so just keep
[48:28] remembering her in prayer amen I just
[48:31] want to share with you something very
[48:34] lovely before we go into the word
[48:36] that um our brother John Andes which
[48:40] many of you have known brother John for
[48:42] many many years
[48:43] and God has has called him
[48:49] and he had to step out in faith and he
[48:52] started a little church on the United
[48:54] States the U.S side there Whatcom County
[48:57] or
[48:59] whereabouts I don't know where the
[49:01] counties start and stop there but
[49:04] to start a church a little over a year
[49:07] ago when they've been meeting in a
[49:09] community center and we've been there
[49:12] before Saints those that have been part
[49:14] of the church going way back where you
[49:16] walk in on a Sunday morning and there's
[49:19] empty beer cans and things spilled on
[49:21] the floor and the atmosphere is just
[49:24] terrible and they've dealt with that God
[49:26] has has just anointed them to deal with
[49:29] that and then someone sees someone share
[49:32] someone and all of a sudden hears a
[49:35] building and they don't sit back and say
[49:37] you know what uh we're gonna just hope
[49:39] that maybe God would do something but I
[49:42] like this and I want this to be a little
[49:43] life lesson to you when God has anointed
[49:47] you to pray whatever the circumstance
[49:50] might be
[49:51] and you pray and you pray with an honest
[49:54] and Open Heart Lord thy will be done and
[49:57] when the door opens in front of you
[49:59] don't decide you need to pray about it
[50:01] for a month amen if it fits the will of
[50:05] God and your motive is right and your
[50:08] objective is right is this not what the
[50:10] prophet taught us then you step into
[50:12] that and they contacted them and said
[50:16] can we look at the building and
[50:18] initially the owner of the building said
[50:20] the last church I rented this building
[50:22] to it's actually a church building and
[50:24] the last church I rented it to
[50:26] didn't pay the rent they tore the
[50:29] building up and we're thinking more like
[50:31] renting it to a daycare or something
[50:33] else and and God was on the scene they
[50:37] rented it to them and today is their
[50:40] first day in their new church and I
[50:45] share all of that because I the new
[50:47] transparent me I never was transparent
[50:49] too much in the past right you just know
[50:51] all my problems and you know my thoughts
[50:53] but anyway
[50:55] um
[50:56] you give
[50:58] an offering to help facilitate that I
[51:03] say this jokingly because we give them
[51:05] Liberty to spend it that way but
[51:07] um you bought approximately 40 chairs
[51:10] for them and uh you know just a little
[51:13] blessing a little love gift that we
[51:16] could just reach out and and give to
[51:18] them of this Grand Endeavor there's a
[51:21] lot of things that you know as the
[51:23] church here that if you're just renting
[51:25] in a building somewhere you don't need
[51:27] those but as they were praying and
[51:29] brother John shared these lovely
[51:31] testimonies to me Lord we got our own
[51:33] building now we need a baptismal oh
[51:35] Craigslist we use baptismal we need to
[51:39] pull look here's a Pulpit and it fits
[51:41] the Decor on Craigslist oh here's this
[51:44] oh here's that and God has just blessed
[51:47] them and if I I should have had the
[51:50] foresight to have done this and just put
[51:52] the picture of the sanctuary up but you
[51:54] would think they've been having Church
[51:56] there for a while they've got everything
[51:58] they need
[52:00] now a building that's been dedicated and
[52:03] I say this for us also Grace Tabernacle
[52:05] a building that's been dedicated to God
[52:08] and is filled with holy ghost-filled
[52:11] people what more do we need
[52:14] amen we have turned it into the house of
[52:17] God and so just remember them they'll be
[52:20] starting probably
[52:21] um
[52:22] about now
[52:24] and just lift a little word of prayer
[52:26] that that their first service they've
[52:29] already got two baptismals to take place
[52:31] today God is moving amen is it good to
[52:34] be in the house of God today hallelujah
[52:37] amen I want to just speak to you this
[52:39] morning as we turn in things that are to
[52:42] be
[52:43] you know I've just become enthralled by
[52:45] this elect lady have you ever met her
[52:48] amen I I just she is the she is the most
[52:52] wonderful lady that you could ever meet
[52:55] in your life they used to say about the
[52:58] Queen of England that she was just this
[53:01] Grand Regal lady well I'm here to tell
[53:04] you she pales
[53:06] in the presence of the elect lady amen
[53:10] and so we stand here today and I want to
[53:12] speak to you on the topic the elect Lady
[53:14] it's more than just a name amen let's
[53:18] turn into Isaiah the third chapter
[53:21] and we will take our original text here
[53:24] from the third chapter verses one
[53:27] through five and then the 12th verse
[53:29] also amen and what we're going to talk
[53:33] about today in essence is lay a
[53:35] foundation of the signs of our time and
[53:38] and we want to look at this because my
[53:41] brother and sister we don't want to
[53:42] focus just on the negative as the
[53:45] negative signs of our time right because
[53:47] we can look out here and say look what's
[53:49] happening
[53:50] oh look at this oh look at this look at
[53:53] that but my brother and sister for every
[53:55] negative sign that we might see there is
[53:58] more than enough positive signs showing
[54:01] that before that can happen this must
[54:04] happen so before the bride can go home
[54:07] amen the prophecies must be fulfilled
[54:11] we don't want to would you today say
[54:13] well Lord just skip over some of those
[54:15] prophecies so we can get out of here
[54:17] no because some of those prophecies
[54:19] concern us we're connected we're
[54:22] interlaced into these prophecies so we
[54:25] want them to come to pass we want that
[54:28] to happen because that's the word being
[54:30] manifested to you and I amen
[54:33] for behold the Lord the Lord of hosts
[54:35] the take away from Jerusalem and from
[54:38] Judah the stay
[54:40] and the staff the whole stay of bread
[54:43] and the whole stay of water
[54:45] the Mighty Man
[54:47] and the man of war the judge and the
[54:50] prophet and The Prudent and the ancient
[54:53] the captain of 50 and The Honorable man
[54:57] and the counselor
[54:58] and the cunning
[55:00] artificer however you say that and the
[55:03] eloquent orator
[55:05] and I will give children to be their
[55:08] princes and babes shall rule over them
[55:12] and the people shall be oppressed
[55:14] Everyone by another and Everyone by his
[55:17] neighbor
[55:18] the child shall behave himself proudly
[55:21] against the ancient and the base Against
[55:24] The Honorable Heavenly Father we ask you
[55:27] to bless the word today come father
[55:29] speak to our hearts with a lovely time
[55:31] to be in the house of God lord just to
[55:33] receive from you and rejoice father for
[55:36] the promise has been given and we
[55:38] receive it in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:40] amen you may be seated
[55:49] now
[55:50] here in Isaiah 3 I'm actually just going
[55:54] to draw the basic thought from it and
[55:56] we'll go on into Isaiah 4. but we're
[55:59] looking
[56:00] that the Lord of hosts is going to take
[56:03] away from Jerusalem and Judah
[56:06] the stay and the staff and the bread and
[56:09] the water Mighty Man see all of these
[56:11] things being removed from society in the
[56:14] man of war and the man that's a good
[56:15] judge and a prophet and The Prudent and
[56:18] the agent the captains of 50 and
[56:20] Honorable Men and counselors and the
[56:23] cunning and the eloquent
[56:24] and what he's going to do is this
[56:27] prophecy is replace them
[56:30] with children
[56:31] now my brother and sister it's there
[56:34] elevating and you say but did they
[56:36] really give children actual children to
[56:39] be the princess well my brother and
[56:41] sister we're going to look at it in a
[56:43] spiritual context today but if the word
[56:45] said that that was done then it was done
[56:48] we don't have to try and find history to
[56:50] prove uh what it is but you look and
[56:53] what I want to focus and take on a verse
[56:55] 4 today is what it was my brother and
[56:58] sister is it was showing that all honor
[57:01] would be gone and you look in our day in
[57:03] our country you don't have to look
[57:05] anywhere else you'll find that in the
[57:08] leadership and in the high places the
[57:10] prophet of God said you could put a
[57:11] George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in
[57:14] every everywhere and and it wouldn't
[57:16] make any difference because you see it
[57:18] was prophesied that honor would be taken
[57:21] away it would be removed from it and we
[57:23] look at those who rule our nation now
[57:26] and they have no honor they rise to the
[57:29] highest offices and yet it is founded
[57:31] that they have these dark secrets that
[57:34] they have hidden and they have done that
[57:36] and so their honor is marred but you
[57:39] look my brother and sister and see how
[57:42] this comes as honor is removed it is the
[57:45] children the princes and the babes what
[57:48] this is pointing to is immature
[57:51] leadership it is not a leadership with
[57:54] wisdom and I don't want to go into
[57:56] politics today but I believe every one
[57:58] of us plays even a reasonable amount of
[58:01] attention would look and say how could
[58:04] they do what they're doing how could
[58:07] they take our nation and just keep
[58:10] continually driving it into a financial
[58:13] deficit wasting money giving it away
[58:16] like it was free and you look at that
[58:18] and realize that prophecy must come to
[58:21] pass and there is an immature leadership
[58:24] Spirit upon them and you say immature
[58:27] grown men seasoned great but my brother
[58:30] and sister are not one one drop of
[58:32] maturity in the things of God one drop
[58:35] of maturity that would cause them to
[58:38] seek the counsel of God they're anointed
[58:41] by the spirit of the day when the
[58:43] prophet of God said that our nation amen
[58:46] I you know it is what it is we just have
[58:48] to claim it but our nation would be
[58:50] completely bankrupt and it's there we're
[58:53] looking my brother and sister now the
[58:55] great fuss of whether we go ahead and
[58:57] drive the nation from these billions in
[58:59] deficit to these billions in deficit no
[59:03] solution they're not saying you know
[59:04] what we've got to turn the course and go
[59:06] back and correct this problem they're
[59:08] just looking at how do we keep it from
[59:11] getting uh less worse that's not English
[59:14] is it much worse
[59:16] from going
[59:18] you see what happens my brother and
[59:19] sister is it comes to this place that
[59:22] the leadership doesn't know how to fix
[59:24] it and God has anointed them to come to
[59:28] that position can someone say thank you
[59:30] Lord amen because prophecy will be
[59:33] fulfilled it will come to the place that
[59:36] it has to happen and we're here and
[59:39] while they are going their Direction
[59:41] praise God we're going our Direction
[59:43] amen we're not required to walk with
[59:46] them amen we dwell on the same Earth for
[59:49] a season but we're not required to walk
[59:51] with him but it says here the people
[59:54] shall verse 5 shall be oppressed
[59:56] Everyone by another Everyone by his
[59:59] neighbor and the child shall behave
[1:00:01] himself proudly against the ancient and
[1:00:04] the base Against The Honorable amen and
[1:00:07] so we look at that and realize now
[1:00:09] pardon me for using this phrase it's a
[1:00:11] kind of just a crass almost phrase of
[1:00:14] the age but my brother and sister have
[1:00:16] you ever seen so many care friends Papa
[1:00:20] yeah everywhere you go there is someone
[1:00:22] there that is there to express their
[1:00:25] opinion of what you can and cannot do
[1:00:27] you cannot live your own life in your
[1:00:30] own backyard because we might hear you
[1:00:34] you cannot do this or you can't hang uh
[1:00:37] you know a Christian flag you can't do
[1:00:39] all of this because uh you're offending
[1:00:42] me my brother and sister it's there that
[1:00:44] the oppressors are coming out of the
[1:00:46] woodwork and you say but why would that
[1:00:49] be well it's scriptural but my brother
[1:00:51] and sister this evil spirit laodicea and
[1:00:54] spirit is breaking through the surface
[1:00:57] of the Earth it's breaking through the
[1:00:59] atmosphere and it's becoming more and
[1:01:01] more manifested and the ultimate of that
[1:01:04] spirit is total oppression when the mark
[1:01:07] of the beast when all of that is in
[1:01:09] control it will be all mankind that is
[1:01:12] oppressed not just Believers not just
[1:01:14] Christians amen and so you see this
[1:01:17] manifesting or breaking out amen well
[1:01:21] that's while that's breaking out the
[1:01:22] holy spirit is moving amongst the midst
[1:01:25] of the bride of Christ and the Holy
[1:01:28] Ghost is breaking out in people's lives
[1:01:30] and they're saying I'm tired of this I'm
[1:01:32] tired of not having Victory I'm not
[1:01:34] having Liberty I'm going to claim my
[1:01:37] Liberty I'm going to claim my victory
[1:01:39] and it's breaking out and Satan they're
[1:01:41] the great imitator is looking and saying
[1:01:44] you know what if God can do that for his
[1:01:46] people I can do that to these people you
[1:01:49] see he never claimed him as his people
[1:01:51] because ultimately he'll just destroy
[1:01:53] him anyhow so you don't want to claim
[1:01:55] something to destroy you don't talk with
[1:01:57] pride of some possession only to go out
[1:02:00] and destroy it so to Satan it's only a
[1:02:04] matter of manipulation of who he can
[1:02:06] make to do what he wants because he sees
[1:02:09] himself as the ultimate where our Lord
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ sees you and I as a literal
[1:02:15] part of him
[1:02:17] amen and no man the scripture says
[1:02:20] hateth his own flesh amen but that
[1:02:23] anointing of laodicea sure makes it look
[1:02:25] as though man hates man amen so you look
[1:02:28] at this and verse 12 we jump forward as
[1:02:31] for my people children are their
[1:02:34] oppressors and women rule over them oh
[1:02:37] my people they which lead thee calls
[1:02:39] thee to Air and destroy the way of thy
[1:02:42] Pals and so we see this is a perfect
[1:02:46] prophecy perfect word for the day that
[1:02:49] we live in and we're seeing how that
[1:02:51] this is coming to pass and it's here
[1:02:54] that we see my brother and sister the
[1:02:56] very world that we live in I could
[1:02:59] recount to you some that I know
[1:03:01] personally have taken place some that
[1:03:03] you hear about but we live in a day and
[1:03:05] age or a child this took place in the
[1:03:09] country of Chile
[1:03:10] and it had a beautiful wonderful ending
[1:03:13] but we were going to to
[1:03:16] what was a camp we held way down in the
[1:03:19] uh in the mountains when we went up
[1:03:21] there to
[1:03:23] no not Picone it was anyway it doesn't
[1:03:26] matter
[1:03:28] um
[1:03:29] and as we're going to this Camp there
[1:03:31] was a brother and sister come
[1:03:34] and said our child's out of control
[1:03:38] completely out of control
[1:03:42] and the child's responses is if you say
[1:03:44] one thing or do one thing to me
[1:03:46] I will call the authorities
[1:03:49] and it will be you not me that's in
[1:03:52] trouble
[1:03:53] that's a powerful Spirit when a child
[1:03:55] threatens
[1:03:57] the parent
[1:03:59] and you know they'll support me not you
[1:04:03] and the parents said brother Paul is
[1:04:04] there something you can do and I thought
[1:04:06] about it and I just remember all my
[1:04:08] child rearing days and the children that
[1:04:11] God gave us and how that even by the
[1:04:14] third one is brother Stephen shared at
[1:04:16] Camp It's a grand experiment
[1:04:19] and so I had no answer for their
[1:04:22] experiment
[1:04:24] and you know all we could do is pray and
[1:04:27] we went to prayer about that and every
[1:04:29] time I would see that child there in the
[1:04:31] camp I would just stop for a moment and
[1:04:34] say Lord touch that child
[1:04:37] and when the camp was coming to a close
[1:04:41] here's a child with a very rebellious
[1:04:43] Spirit now I know none of us have ever
[1:04:45] been rebellious so we can't relate
[1:04:48] to what rebellious Spirits are like
[1:04:51] but here's a child with a rebellious
[1:04:53] Spirit but this is why we never give
[1:04:55] give up hope as parents as Ministry
[1:04:59] because in a moment of time in one
[1:05:02] service the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:05:04] changed that boy's life
[1:05:07] Amen in one moment and when we we saw
[1:05:10] that family later because we were going
[1:05:12] back to their home Church to hold some
[1:05:14] Services before we come home and when we
[1:05:17] saw the child the parents just almost
[1:05:19] weeping of this is like our child God
[1:05:23] gave us our child back amen the spirit
[1:05:26] was broken and my brother and sister you
[1:05:29] get to see how that God is coming and
[1:05:32] he's here with his people and he said
[1:05:34] I'm not forsaking you and I will not
[1:05:36] leave you I'll be with you and we'll
[1:05:39] touch on that in a minute in a quote
[1:05:40] here but you look at what God is doing
[1:05:43] because there's a spirit of Oppression
[1:05:45] the world is worried today and I'm sorry
[1:05:48] to touch on this because God some of us
[1:05:51] we suffer from different things and and
[1:05:53] whatnot but my brother and sister the
[1:05:55] world we're living in is getting
[1:05:57] increasingly neurotic
[1:06:00] increasingly and you know sometimes you
[1:06:03] know maybe we have an anxiety uh that's
[1:06:06] bothering us my brother and sister we've
[1:06:08] been given the answer maybe we get a
[1:06:11] little depressed we've been given the
[1:06:12] answer and maybe we get you know all of
[1:06:15] the attributes of the mind that we get
[1:06:17] we've been given the answer we know
[1:06:19] where to go to get the answer and God is
[1:06:23] gracious to his people amen and so it's
[1:06:26] here that we should not identify with
[1:06:29] verse 5 and say I am oppressed but we
[1:06:32] should stand on the word and say I know
[1:06:35] that God spoken I believe it it will
[1:06:38] come to pass I am an overcomer I am
[1:06:41] victorious I am of a sound mind
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] and somebody might say well brother Paul
[1:06:49] you don't understand but let me tell you
[1:06:51] I do understand I have been to the
[1:06:54] precipice I have stood and looked in the
[1:06:57] dark hole
[1:06:59] and I know God's got an answer that
[1:07:01] brings us back from the precipice God's
[1:07:04] got the word my brother and sister and
[1:07:05] he's given it to you and I
[1:07:07] amen so we look at the age that we're
[1:07:10] living in and we see the children rising
[1:07:13] up and we see how it is in influenced in
[1:07:17] such a fashion let me just throw this in
[1:07:19] it's not actual children but depending
[1:07:22] on what your age is if you're 25 a 20
[1:07:25] year old doesn't seem like a child to
[1:07:27] you but the older you get 25 or 20 seems
[1:07:31] like children amen I can assure you it's
[1:07:34] how it feels and so you look and and
[1:07:37] cities like Portland where they just sit
[1:07:40] back and and a video clip of young men
[1:07:44] uh with young women rooting them on
[1:07:47] young men running through a car lot
[1:07:48] busting the windows out of every car how
[1:07:52] does that change the world my brother
[1:07:53] and sister are that's nothing but a
[1:07:56] demonic Spirit expressing itself
[1:07:58] bringing an oppression as the scripture
[1:08:01] calls it on the ancients on the older
[1:08:04] people are looking and saying what is
[1:08:05] happening here but these anointings that
[1:08:07] have come upon them my brother and
[1:08:09] sister I watched a video also about
[1:08:12] Portland and this young man is there and
[1:08:15] when they finally are able to subdue him
[1:08:17] and you talk about demonic power when it
[1:08:20] takes three or four big men to hold down
[1:08:23] one scrawny teenager you know there's
[1:08:26] something more than natural strength
[1:08:28] involved and he's snarling and foaming
[1:08:30] at the mouth and this is the anointing
[1:08:33] of laodicea of that dark Spirit coming
[1:08:37] up to the surface of what they've got to
[1:08:40] look forward to but I'm telling you my
[1:08:42] brother and sister God said I've got a
[1:08:44] whole nother plan for you I've got a
[1:08:46] whole nother vision for you and I want
[1:08:48] you to see this vision and I want you to
[1:08:51] live this Vision you know here's some
[1:08:53] time back we were singing a song and I
[1:08:56] just uh encountered a little chorus
[1:08:58] there and I just started you know it's
[1:09:00] the song I'm in that number and if you
[1:09:02] remember member I started singing it I'm
[1:09:04] in that Vision I'm in that Vision
[1:09:07] Hallelujah there was a vision a prophet
[1:09:09] said I saw that bride of Christ and she
[1:09:11] didn't go down over outer sight she went
[1:09:13] up I'll tell you what I'm in that Vision
[1:09:16] amen I'm part of that that come to pass
[1:09:19] in that can you say Amen to that amen so
[1:09:22] you look at this and see now for the
[1:09:24] sake of time I could expound a little
[1:09:26] more here but for the sake of time let's
[1:09:28] go to Isaiah 4 verses 1 and 2 because we
[1:09:32] want to stay on on focused today because
[1:09:35] we are looking my brother and sister
[1:09:37] about the name and where does the name
[1:09:40] fit in and how is this and so we come
[1:09:44] Isaiah 4 verses 1 and 2 and in that day
[1:09:48] see this is just following it's talking
[1:09:49] about the spirits it's talking about
[1:09:51] what is taking place it's talking about
[1:09:53] the removal of wisdom and Providence and
[1:09:57] all of these things from society and
[1:09:59] leaving these that would oppress and it
[1:10:02] says and in that day seven women shall
[1:10:04] take hold of one man saying we'll eat
[1:10:06] our own bread we'll wear our own apparel
[1:10:08] only let us be called by thy name to
[1:10:11] take away or reproach
[1:10:14] and now we take another shift and in
[1:10:17] that day shall the branch of the Lord be
[1:10:19] beautiful and glorious in the fruit of
[1:10:21] the Earth shall be excellent and calmly
[1:10:23] for them that are escaped of Israel and
[1:10:27] you look at this in the very time my
[1:10:29] brother and sister that seven women
[1:10:31] seven Church age Spirits are coming
[1:10:34] saying all we want is your name so this
[1:10:37] didn't just come in laodicea and
[1:10:39] suddenly Blossom this has been happening
[1:10:41] through all of the church ages that they
[1:10:44] said I'm willing to just take the
[1:10:46] identity by the name
[1:10:49] hmm now we believe in the name we not
[1:10:52] and we want to be under that name we
[1:10:54] want to claim that name but you've got
[1:10:55] to understand the counter of that the
[1:10:58] spirit that is there a name is a
[1:11:01] covering because we know in the natural
[1:11:03] that a woman can take a man's name and
[1:11:05] not be his wife
[1:11:10] that's right
[1:11:12] so you look at that in the very time
[1:11:14] that these women are declaring we only
[1:11:17] want your name to take away our reproach
[1:11:19] God's declaring that the branch of the
[1:11:22] Lord will be beautiful and glorious in
[1:11:24] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[1:11:25] excellent and calmly to them that are
[1:11:26] escaped
[1:11:28] hey aren't you glad today you've escaped
[1:11:30] aren't you glad the word had come down
[1:11:32] and has pulled you out of the spirit of
[1:11:35] laodicea and taken you into another
[1:11:37] realm amen the prophet of God talks
[1:11:39] about the bride age and talking about
[1:11:41] that glorious time moving forward some
[1:11:44] tried to make it a Doctrine and say
[1:11:45] we're not doing there but what God's
[1:11:47] trying to do is get you and I to see
[1:11:49] that this world is not our home and he's
[1:11:52] taking us into a home that we'll be
[1:11:54] happy we'll be glorified in and we'll be
[1:11:57] blessed to be in that place amen so you
[1:12:00] look at that now of those two scriptures
[1:12:03] that Isaiah prophesies which one do you
[1:12:05] want to blame
[1:12:08] you want to disclaim a name
[1:12:12] or you want to be the branch of the Lord
[1:12:13] that's beautiful and glorified in this
[1:12:16] day amen there's two Spirits right in
[1:12:19] the framework of the church and one
[1:12:21] wants the name and one wants the uh oh
[1:12:24] how do you say it not just benefits
[1:12:27] we're not here just for benefits but you
[1:12:29] know we're here because this is what God
[1:12:31] has called us and promised and there's
[1:12:34] something inside of us a deep calling to
[1:12:36] that deep aren't you glad that deep is
[1:12:38] there amen so these prophetic words have
[1:12:41] come to pass and you look and let me
[1:12:43] back up a little bit we're seeing
[1:12:46] Nations run by very immature people
[1:12:51] greedy people
[1:12:54] they're just Desiring what the nation
[1:12:56] can do for them the lifestyle and The
[1:12:59] Prestige
[1:13:01] and
[1:13:02] we're seeing the churches
[1:13:05] of our modern day
[1:13:07] run by very immature people
[1:13:13] what are they led by the spirit of the
[1:13:15] day
[1:13:18] the spirit
[1:13:19] of this evil age as brother Branham
[1:13:21] preached
[1:13:22] that's what they're led by
[1:13:29] I watched a video here recently taken
[1:13:31] out of a live service
[1:13:35] and the minister
[1:13:36] ask for the
[1:13:38] offering count
[1:13:42] and they brought up a piece of paper and
[1:13:43] they put it there
[1:13:45] and he said it's not enough money past
[1:13:47] the offering plate again
[1:13:53] foreign
[1:14:00] you know what it shows
[1:14:02] why they're there
[1:14:04] my god is perfect if God said the
[1:14:06] offering is going to be ten dollars
[1:14:08] today and you would have had more money
[1:14:09] you were going to give you'd have forgot
[1:14:11] your wallet
[1:14:12] that's how much my God's in control
[1:14:15] so it shows they're not about the word
[1:14:17] they're about the money they're about
[1:14:19] the prosperity they're about something
[1:14:21] besides that because if they showed up
[1:14:24] to church with their Bible they should
[1:14:26] have been able to have Revival with
[1:14:29] nothing else hindering them but being
[1:14:31] able to press into the word amen but you
[1:14:35] see their spirits and they're led by
[1:14:37] these immature Spirits these immature
[1:14:40] men led by Spirits you see logic is gone
[1:14:44] amen now logic my brother and sister is
[1:14:47] just another word for reasoning and you
[1:14:51] know the scripture people say well we
[1:14:52] don't go by reasoning but the scripture
[1:14:54] does tell us let us reason together so
[1:14:56] we don't become ignorant and and just
[1:14:59] without any kind of understanding but we
[1:15:02] don't let our reasoning of the flesh
[1:15:04] control how we approach God we let the
[1:15:06] word control how we approach God and so
[1:15:10] it's there that uh they are uh uh uh
[1:15:13] losing their logic you can see uh just
[1:15:17] not sound judgmental just facts today
[1:15:19] amen driving to church you see people
[1:15:21] getting out of their cars in front of a
[1:15:23] church and walking in and I'm quite
[1:15:25] certain they're going to the lake this
[1:15:27] afternoon because they're in shorts tank
[1:15:29] tops and flip-flops going to the house
[1:15:31] of God I want to ask you a question are
[1:15:34] you not happy that the prophet of God
[1:15:36] laid a foundation we ought to wear our
[1:15:39] best church amen we don't need to come
[1:15:41] to church looking like a bunch of Beach
[1:15:43] Bums we ought to come to church as we
[1:15:46] are approaching God in the holiest of
[1:15:48] holies we are coming face to face with
[1:15:51] almighty God and awesome God a loving
[1:15:54] God but also the word says a jealous God
[1:15:57] Amen and I want to come and present
[1:16:00] myself appropriately to my God to come
[1:16:04] and tell him I respect you
[1:16:06] amen I want to show that I respect you
[1:16:09] no different than if you were invited to
[1:16:12] go to some place of high Authority they
[1:16:15] wouldn't go to the White House in their
[1:16:18] flip-flops shorts and tank top but
[1:16:20] they'll go to the house of God now that
[1:16:22] shows you where their opinion of higher
[1:16:25] authority is at amen so it's there oh
[1:16:30] but look what's happened we live in a
[1:16:32] day and I'm clipped a lot out of this
[1:16:34] because it's just too big a talk and I I
[1:16:36] didn't want to start and stop it but my
[1:16:38] brother and sister it's there that the
[1:16:41] spirit of church today is that they are
[1:16:44] assuming it's enough
[1:16:46] to have the name
[1:16:49] but the prophet of God said there's many
[1:16:51] people
[1:16:52] named Jesus or if you pronounce it in
[1:16:54] Spanish Jesus
[1:16:55] many people named Jesus
[1:17:00] so you have to find the right Avenue
[1:17:02] when you're talking about the name
[1:17:05] and the name is over the door the name
[1:17:07] is on the sign the name is in posters
[1:17:10] it's in the Creed it's in all of this
[1:17:12] but it actually is nothing more than a
[1:17:15] name amen because that name is such a
[1:17:19] glorious name that name is all-powerful
[1:17:21] but my brother and sister when used in a
[1:17:24] fashion and you say well brother Paul
[1:17:25] what do you mean well look my brother
[1:17:27] and sister I want to tell you that this
[1:17:30] I'm going to get ahead of myself here
[1:17:32] but I hear people in a regular basis use
[1:17:35] the name of Jesus Christ but it's more
[1:17:38] often used as a slang or a slander or a
[1:17:43] vain word than it is used as a holy word
[1:17:45] and so just to use the name or to speak
[1:17:49] the name from human lips does not give
[1:17:52] Authority or power to the name it is how
[1:17:56] the name is used and who is using it
[1:18:01] and brother Branham lays that out as
[1:18:03] he's talking about there's only one lady
[1:18:05] in the church here that uh her name is
[1:18:08] Mrs Branham she's the only one that goes
[1:18:11] home with me amen now there could be any
[1:18:14] woman walk up to you or I brothers and
[1:18:18] say husband but it would not apply
[1:18:21] unless it was our wife amen and when
[1:18:25] it's the wife speaking the name becomes
[1:18:28] a beautiful name and the name becomes
[1:18:31] powerful the name releases the word of
[1:18:34] God it releases a moving of the spirit
[1:18:36] but it's got to be spoke by someone
[1:18:39] who's in the right relationship
[1:18:42] and so it's not just the fact that we
[1:18:45] use the name or have the name can speak
[1:18:47] the name but it must have relationship
[1:18:51] amen so we look I'll tell you if you do
[1:18:56] a little studying you'll find this amen
[1:18:59] even the denominations are starting
[1:19:02] people starting to lament that the
[1:19:04] denominations
[1:19:06] are more like a social club
[1:19:09] then church
[1:19:12] and they say oh I would that we would
[1:19:15] have a church that would just preach the
[1:19:16] truth
[1:19:22] do you think they can handle the truth
[1:19:27] we're Believers and sometimes the truth
[1:19:29] hurts
[1:19:31] let me see a hand of those that
[1:19:33] sometimes the truth hurts
[1:19:35] yeah
[1:19:37] yeah sometimes the truth hurts and we're
[1:19:39] believers
[1:19:41] and they are well I don't want to judge
[1:19:43] them anyway God knows but they're there
[1:19:45] saying we want truth we want truth but
[1:19:47] when they come face to face with truth
[1:19:49] they say they're legalistic they're
[1:19:51] harsh they're this they're that my
[1:19:53] brother and sister I want you to
[1:19:55] understand how special that anointing
[1:19:58] God has placed in you is that you can
[1:20:00] come face to face and before you run
[1:20:02] from the word you stop and say Lord is
[1:20:05] that me that they're speaking about is
[1:20:07] that me the word is addressing and when
[1:20:09] the holy spirit moves upon you and says
[1:20:11] yes it is we say forgive me Lord I need
[1:20:13] to come back to the truth because you
[1:20:16] see truth has become subjective
[1:20:18] everybody's got a different truth and I
[1:20:21] got that quote from a woman preacher
[1:20:25] hmm
[1:20:27] everybody's
[1:20:29] version of Truth
[1:20:31] is a little different
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] look at vashti
[1:20:37] history
[1:20:39] scripture shows us history says vastly
[1:20:41] was beautiful
[1:20:42] it's considered one of the most
[1:20:44] beautiful women
[1:20:46] of that era of that time
[1:20:49] she had his name
[1:20:52] but she wasn't a wife
[1:20:57] so
[1:20:58] in her position she could have claimed
[1:21:01] anything she couldn't have done but you
[1:21:04] see what God did anointed that to me
[1:21:06] because he had a plan so it left that
[1:21:10] spirit that anointing title left a
[1:21:13] varsity and went to one who desired the
[1:21:16] relationship more than she cared about
[1:21:19] the title more than she cared about the
[1:21:22] name amen we have a brief Glimpse in
[1:21:25] scripture but you don't see vashti going
[1:21:27] out saying make this happen because I am
[1:21:31] Esther I mean not not bashti Esther
[1:21:34] didn't go out and say make this happen
[1:21:36] because I am Esther
[1:21:39] Esther said I want to please my husband
[1:21:42] when I have a banquet I don't want 5 000
[1:21:45] I don't want to entertain all the other
[1:21:47] women in the Kingdom like vashti wanted
[1:21:49] to she said I want to entertain my
[1:21:52] husband and so she prepared her banquet
[1:21:55] for the presence of her husband and you
[1:21:58] say but she had motive don't we all
[1:22:01] come on don't we all have motive amen
[1:22:04] every one of us has a reason
[1:22:07] I want to be that the reason I'm in the
[1:22:09] house of God today the reason that
[1:22:11] you're in the house of God today is
[1:22:13] because I couldn't keep myself from
[1:22:15] being here then I was attracted I wanted
[1:22:17] to be here I wanted to fulfill the word
[1:22:19] and be filled with the word amen not
[1:22:22] that I had to check off some attendance
[1:22:24] card
[1:22:25] but there was something in me that
[1:22:27] wanted to do and I want to be like
[1:22:29] Esther and I want to just have the Holy
[1:22:32] Spirit Come to Me come to you move us
[1:22:35] because we desire it amen not because we
[1:22:40] claim it we can say I've got the Holy
[1:22:42] Ghost I'm telling you uh you know I'll
[1:22:44] just keep this real vague but I have in
[1:22:47] just the last few years come across
[1:22:49] people that just emphatically had the
[1:22:51] Holy Ghost and I would have been I'd
[1:22:53] rather jumped in a cage with a wild cat
[1:22:56] then deal with them
[1:22:58] and they'll tell you I have the Holy
[1:23:00] Ghost
[1:23:02] hmm
[1:23:03] wow
[1:23:04] now second John 1.
[1:23:07] I think maybe you would have had to bend
[1:23:09] there to really been impressed by that
[1:23:12] thought
[1:23:13] John 1 1 sec II John 1 1.
[1:23:17] second John 1 1 the Elder and to the
[1:23:19] elect lady and her children whom I love
[1:23:22] in the truth and not I only but also all
[1:23:25] they that have known the truth for
[1:23:27] truth's sake which dwelleth in us shall
[1:23:29] be with us forever
[1:23:31] so you see John what he's expressing
[1:23:34] here he is not expressing that you uh
[1:23:38] fulfill this or you're in this position
[1:23:41] uh about having a name
[1:23:44] John didn't say you know to all of you
[1:23:46] that have the name
[1:23:47] John said to those of you that have the
[1:23:49] truth
[1:23:50] amen so the identity was not in the name
[1:23:54] I hope you follow me because we are not
[1:23:56] putting the name of Jesus Christ on a
[1:23:57] shelf somewhere but we are recognizing
[1:24:00] the day that we have is a vast majority
[1:24:03] of people believed by being identified
[1:24:06] with the name that they actually have
[1:24:10] him
[1:24:12] you can have the name without having him
[1:24:15] I will just drive this home many years
[1:24:16] ago there was a very well-off man
[1:24:19] married a wife
[1:24:23] but she refused to actually be a wife
[1:24:27] and after a year he said I'm done with
[1:24:30] this I didn't marry someone just to have
[1:24:32] in the house to be a show peace to do
[1:24:34] this and when it went to court
[1:24:37] in the divorce she wanted all this money
[1:24:40] she wanted all these assets she wanted
[1:24:42] all this stuff but ultimately it come
[1:24:45] down to it the judge says even though
[1:24:47] you took the name and you lived in his
[1:24:50] house you never consummated or had the
[1:24:54] relationship so therefore you were never
[1:24:57] really his wife
[1:24:59] that's in the flesh that's in the
[1:25:01] natural not in this world right here
[1:25:04] they recognize there had to be an
[1:25:05] intimacy there had to be a relationship
[1:25:08] took place it wasn't a matter of just
[1:25:10] acquiring the name but there had to be
[1:25:13] something that proved that the wife was
[1:25:15] really a wife and the husband was really
[1:25:18] a husband and I say God help us that
[1:25:21] we're not going to settle for just
[1:25:22] having a name but we want the
[1:25:25] relationship we want to have the
[1:25:27] intimacy with our Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:25:30] come into the place that we can stand
[1:25:32] with confidence amen and say I am the
[1:25:35] Bride of Jesus Christ I am his wife and
[1:25:39] there's no one to stand there even the
[1:25:42] devil wouldn't be able to refute it
[1:25:44] because he would look at your life and
[1:25:46] say they live like his wife they act
[1:25:48] like his wife they serve him like a wife
[1:25:51] how can you deny they're the wife amen
[1:25:54] and that's what I want to be today I
[1:25:57] want to be so thoroughly Vindicated it
[1:26:00] as the Bride of Jesus Christ that the
[1:26:03] world would say they're different we
[1:26:05] were in Kem for those of you weren't
[1:26:07] there we were in Camp and the hosts at
[1:26:10] the camp over and over and over again
[1:26:12] said we have a lot of Christians come to
[1:26:15] this camp but you guys are different
[1:26:19] oh I want to be different
[1:26:21] I want to just be another religious
[1:26:23] person I want God to look down and say
[1:26:27] that's my wife that's my bride I want
[1:26:30] the world to look and say they're kind
[1:26:32] of crazy but they definitely live what
[1:26:35] they believe
[1:26:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:26:39] that's one of the signs my brother and
[1:26:41] sister of a wife we're not talking about
[1:26:45] subservience here but one of the signs
[1:26:47] of a wife who wants to fulfill her
[1:26:50] position as a wife if she is in harmony
[1:26:53] with her husband she is there you know
[1:26:56] I'll just tell on us this morning you
[1:26:59] know I told Jerry I want a waffle I want
[1:27:02] a waffle for breakfast but she don't let
[1:27:04] me eat real waffles
[1:27:06] because they're not healthy
[1:27:08] and so you know I was like well she says
[1:27:10] you really want a waffle and I said I
[1:27:12] really want a waffle amen so what did
[1:27:14] she do she fixes up me a waffle I don't
[1:27:17] know she might have hid it from me I
[1:27:19] thought I tasted broccoli in there and
[1:27:21] maybe some spinach I don't know but I
[1:27:23] got my Waffle
[1:27:25] she did her best my point is she did her
[1:27:27] best to please me this morning that I I
[1:27:30] was looking for something that resembled
[1:27:32] a waffle and you know why waffles have
[1:27:35] all those little holes in them like that
[1:27:36] up and down the little pockets you're
[1:27:38] supposed to fill them full of butter
[1:27:42] the waffle is a carrier for butter
[1:27:46] but because she loves me I'm just trying
[1:27:48] to make a point because she loves me she
[1:27:51] went out of her way to make me a waffle
[1:27:55] and I was happy
[1:27:57] I was suspicious what's all these little
[1:27:59] spots in this waffle I was pretty sure
[1:28:02] that it looked like it was broccoli or
[1:28:04] cauliflower or something I don't know
[1:28:07] what
[1:28:08] but you see my point being is a real
[1:28:11] wife
[1:28:12] wants to please her husband
[1:28:16] and the prophet taught us these lessons
[1:28:18] a real wife my brother and sister you
[1:28:20] can put her name on the checkbook and
[1:28:23] you can put it there and hand her the
[1:28:24] checkbook and give her the pin amen and
[1:28:27] it's there as the prophet's telling us
[1:28:29] God's give us the checkbook he made the
[1:28:32] deposit he's given us the pin sign it
[1:28:35] make a claim on the promise of God
[1:28:38] that's been given to us why because he's
[1:28:40] not afraid of what he is brought going
[1:28:42] to do he knows his bride's heart and her
[1:28:45] heart is to please him
[1:28:47] amen it's not just to have a coddled
[1:28:51] life I have an ease of life to have all
[1:28:54] these things we want to please him can
[1:28:56] you say Amen this morning Hallelujah
[1:28:59] and John says you know what it's not
[1:29:02] going to be this elect lady and she had
[1:29:05] the name but he identifies her he
[1:29:08] Praises her he lifts her up why because
[1:29:11] this elect lady has truth
[1:29:13] oh I'll tell you isn't that beautiful
[1:29:16] she's got truth
[1:29:18] oh hallelujah amen and I want to say
[1:29:22] today God help us as Grace Tabernacle to
[1:29:26] be a church that is always identified in
[1:29:29] truth
[1:29:30] people I hear lovely testimonies I've
[1:29:33] got one right on my phone that is
[1:29:35] praising you as a church amen it's
[1:29:37] lifting you up as a church of wonderful
[1:29:40] people that you are wonderful Believers
[1:29:42] amen that's wonderful but what is it if
[1:29:45] we're wonderful and don't have truth oh
[1:29:49] God help us we can be wonderful we can
[1:29:52] be Godly we can be kind we can be all of
[1:29:54] these things and have the truth no
[1:29:57] compromise amen we can be the word
[1:30:00] walking in shoe leather and be kind
[1:30:03] loving caring good people
[1:30:06] oh
[1:30:08] my god oh
[1:30:10] well the word said the truth will set us
[1:30:12] free who wants to be free today
[1:30:14] Amen in the name of Truth do you know
[1:30:16] what the name of truth is
[1:30:18] good
[1:30:20] Ness
[1:30:22] did you know truth has a name
[1:30:24] amen I'm not trying to trick you so be
[1:30:27] brave
[1:30:28] the name of Truth is Jesus Christ Our
[1:30:31] Lord Jesus Christ when you have Jesus
[1:30:34] Christ you have truth
[1:30:37] amen but you can have the name of and
[1:30:41] not have truth you've got to possess him
[1:30:45] you've got to get your arms around him
[1:30:48] and not only your arms around him you've
[1:30:51] got to stop living life long enough for
[1:30:54] him to put his arms around you
[1:30:58] right
[1:31:00] you know husbands Brothers have you ever
[1:31:02] been there you want to just give your
[1:31:04] wife a hug but she's maybe doing laundry
[1:31:06] or cooking supper you're there kind of
[1:31:09] hinting I go down the hall you kind of
[1:31:10] put your arm out
[1:31:12] and they just kind of
[1:31:16] and they're in the kitchen
[1:31:18] you kind of go over there there at the
[1:31:20] stove and you kind of go over there and
[1:31:22] try and put your arms around them and
[1:31:24] they just happen to be reaching for the
[1:31:25] bullion you know
[1:31:31] and if we're not careful we'll get this
[1:31:33] idea
[1:31:35] I don't think she loves me today
[1:31:40] but it's all in its appropriate time
[1:31:44] and place
[1:31:46] say why do you say that brother Paul
[1:31:48] I'll tell you that
[1:31:49] it's one thing to walk around in public
[1:31:51] oh I love Jesus I love Jesus I love
[1:31:55] Jesus I love Jesus oh did I tell you how
[1:31:58] much I love Jesus we love Jesus around
[1:32:00] here in our house we love Jesus
[1:32:03] what about
[1:32:04] the evening time
[1:32:11] you know it's not really Netflix it's
[1:32:13] the next flick because that's what the
[1:32:17] devil does
[1:32:18] I loved how Stephen those of you who
[1:32:20] want to count brother Stephen was
[1:32:21] telling us I have addictive behavior I
[1:32:23] almost jumped out of my Pew me too
[1:32:25] brother Stephen
[1:32:30] you know why they put ice cream in half
[1:32:33] gallon containers
[1:32:35] because that's how much was meant to be
[1:32:36] eaten at that time
[1:32:39] they wanted you to eat less they would
[1:32:41] have put it in a smaller container
[1:32:47] come on
[1:32:49] one thing to be in public
[1:32:53] what did the scripture show us
[1:32:55] that was the religious people stood in
[1:33:00] the gate or the door to the temple
[1:33:03] smote their breasts oh God
[1:33:05] I'm so glad I've got more of you than
[1:33:10] they do
[1:33:12] I'm so glad that you've blessed me
[1:33:21] but when the sun sets and no one's
[1:33:24] watching
[1:33:27] pardon me I don't mean to be crass
[1:33:31] but that's the season
[1:33:33] we make love
[1:33:36] that's the season we stop and say oh
[1:33:38] Lord
[1:33:39] I love you so much who's your Witness
[1:33:42] who's your witness we often like I want
[1:33:44] to witness in the workplace well you've
[1:33:46] got a witness in the private Before You
[1:33:49] Can Be an Effective witness in the
[1:33:51] public
[1:33:52] you've got to come to the place that our
[1:33:55] relationship is more than the name amen
[1:33:58] amen and when we get to the place that
[1:34:01] the relationship is more than the name
[1:34:02] when we speak the name I'm going to put
[1:34:05] it this way when we speak the name in
[1:34:07] public there's power behind it because
[1:34:10] our husband is saying that's my bride
[1:34:13] and she speaks it I hear and act upon it
[1:34:17] amen though it's not just words
[1:34:20] it's not just words we're not just
[1:34:22] speaking words we're not just
[1:34:23] proclaiming this my brother and sister I
[1:34:26] hope I got the point I'm going to move
[1:34:27] on Amen now the scripture tells us uh
[1:34:30] that these wonderful things and I just
[1:34:32] reworded that when I said the name of
[1:34:34] Truth is Jesus Christ amen but the
[1:34:37] scripture also tells us that we're the
[1:34:39] spirit of the Lord is
[1:34:42] there's liberty
[1:34:46] Liberty to what
[1:34:50] the world out here has said it's liberty
[1:34:52] because we're under grace
[1:34:55] to do whatever we want
[1:34:58] but I tell you what it is
[1:35:00] Liberty to this bride
[1:35:02] is to do whatever she wants
[1:35:07] wait did I just say the same thing no I
[1:35:09] didn't
[1:35:10] no I didn't
[1:35:11] because you see this bride's a different
[1:35:13] kind of girl
[1:35:15] and her whole desire when she has
[1:35:18] Liberty to do whatever she wants her
[1:35:20] whole desire is how can I please my
[1:35:23] husband
[1:35:24] how can I please him what could I do
[1:35:26] that would bless him and lift him up
[1:35:30] not what I can get away with
[1:35:33] it what can I do for him
[1:35:37] isn't that beautiful
[1:35:39] I love it amen now I wanted to give you
[1:35:42] a counter of our day
[1:35:44] in first Samuel 4 and 21 I I you don't
[1:35:48] have to post it I don't think I even
[1:35:49] wrote it on the deal there if you wanted
[1:35:51] to look in your Bibles you could but
[1:35:53] what we're looking at in first Samuel is
[1:35:55] a story about how that the ark is taken
[1:35:57] uh Eli is now dead son is dead and a
[1:36:01] child is born and Mom is in such
[1:36:04] distress she names the child Ichabod
[1:36:07] now I'm telling you any mother that
[1:36:09] would name her child Ichabod would had
[1:36:11] to have been under great distress to
[1:36:14] have stepped into a position to give
[1:36:16] that name but there is several different
[1:36:19] translations depending on language Etc
[1:36:21] but Ichabod is very similar in all of
[1:36:24] its translations and centering around
[1:36:26] the definition of the glory of God is
[1:36:29] departed now my brother and sister we're
[1:36:32] knowing in the day that we are living in
[1:36:34] that Ichabod has been written over the
[1:36:37] door of organized religion amen so what
[1:36:41] is it that God has departed there it
[1:36:45] isn't very hard if you just observe a
[1:36:47] little bit I tend to be who I am and
[1:36:49] like to study in the way that I like to
[1:36:51] study I like to look at things and find
[1:36:53] a reference to the world I'm out in the
[1:36:55] world you might find a reference here
[1:36:57] find a reference there but my brother
[1:36:59] and sister it's quite apparent
[1:37:03] that if you took modern religion and its
[1:37:06] leadership
[1:37:08] and that's why sisters I thought it was
[1:37:09] so special your song
[1:37:13] take modern leadership
[1:37:15] into the holiest of holies
[1:37:20] you better be prepared to start tugging
[1:37:22] on the Rope
[1:37:26] are you with me
[1:37:28] they couldn't walk in there be
[1:37:30] bought and walk out
[1:37:32] modern religion would walk in there and
[1:37:35] I'm sorry I'm going to throw a little
[1:37:36] morbid human humor in there you imagine
[1:37:39] the pile of preachers would be on the
[1:37:41] outside of the Tabernacle where they'd
[1:37:43] say our religion we've got it amen God's
[1:37:46] blessing us look at all this we've got
[1:37:47] millions of dollars in real estate
[1:37:49] brother Brown hit it right on the head
[1:37:50] right I got investment counts we owned
[1:37:52] car dealerships we own this we own that
[1:37:54] and they'd have been pulling them out
[1:37:56] with the Rope
[1:37:58] because it wouldn't have passed God's
[1:38:00] real test
[1:38:03] hmm
[1:38:05] Lord help me I don't want to be pulled
[1:38:07] out
[1:38:07] I want to walk out
[1:38:09] I want to walk out and say I met the
[1:38:11] Lord in there but the vision I'm not
[1:38:13] trying to make something out of the
[1:38:14] vision but when brother Branham shares
[1:38:16] the vision of that little room my
[1:38:18] brother and sister that was godly people
[1:38:20] that God was dealing with needs in their
[1:38:23] lives and expressing given the Holy
[1:38:25] Ghost and as they walked in there they
[1:38:28] walked out the other door blessed and I
[1:38:30] tell you when I come in the presence
[1:38:31] almighty God I want to walk into the
[1:38:34] holiest of holies and I want to walk out
[1:38:36] and be able to tell you as my brothers
[1:38:38] and sisters I met God in there and he
[1:38:41] blessed me did he correct me yes he
[1:38:44] burns a little dross out of me but
[1:38:46] praise God I met him in there and I'm a
[1:38:49] better man for that
[1:38:51] hey man don't want to walk out saying ah
[1:38:53] well you know God is just a kind God I
[1:38:56] met Grandpa
[1:38:58] I met grandpa in the holiest of holies
[1:39:00] no we don't meet Grandpa in the holiest
[1:39:03] of holies we meet Grandpa at the dinner
[1:39:05] table we meet God in the holiest of
[1:39:08] Holiness amen we've got to get away from
[1:39:11] this watered-down Grandpa kind of
[1:39:13] religion amen so look at this we see Ned
[1:39:17] Ichabod written over the door and it's
[1:39:20] declaring the glory of God is departing
[1:39:22] it is departed amen now look my brother
[1:39:25] and sister
[1:39:26] this is Paul's spin on it are you guys
[1:39:28] okay
[1:39:30] take Paul's spin on it
[1:39:35] the prophet of God would be close said
[1:39:37] it would be close
[1:39:38] it would be right on the cusp
[1:39:42] when denomination
[1:39:45] started searching
[1:39:47] for the oil
[1:39:50] now look where denominations at
[1:39:53] they're raising their voice
[1:39:55] saying we have become
[1:39:57] a club
[1:39:59] we have become a social function
[1:40:02] we have become and they have different
[1:40:05] terms for this
[1:40:07] religious men men with all of the ll's
[1:40:10] and the P's and the Double D's and
[1:40:12] whatever else attached to the name are
[1:40:14] stopping and saying what have you done
[1:40:17] we have fallen
[1:40:18] off the course
[1:40:21] now the reason I say it's my opinion I
[1:40:23] want you to take it like whoa that's it
[1:40:25] that's it but I believe that's part of
[1:40:28] it
[1:40:29] I believe when they come and realize we
[1:40:31] have missed
[1:40:33] we've missed it we've focused on the
[1:40:35] wrong thing we we need to get God back
[1:40:38] in our churches imagine you're a pastor
[1:40:40] of a mega church that has like 10 000
[1:40:43] people every Sunday morning in your
[1:40:44] church and you'll stand in the pulpit
[1:40:46] and make a statement like I believe
[1:40:49] we've missed the will of God
[1:40:53] I'll tell you what if I was sitting in
[1:40:55] that church I'd have to stop and start
[1:40:57] looking around saying whoa we missed it
[1:41:01] does that mean we're falling off the
[1:41:02] Trestle in the river
[1:41:04] what is it how do we backtrack
[1:41:08] I want to just throw this out to you my
[1:41:10] mind your poor attention span
[1:41:14] California many years ago there was a
[1:41:16] great train wreck
[1:41:18] and the engineer realized that they were
[1:41:21] traveling too fast
[1:41:23] and he started trying to break
[1:41:27] the train
[1:41:28] slow it down
[1:41:30] but because of the mixture of cars that
[1:41:33] were in the train what it was made up of
[1:41:35] they had more weight
[1:41:37] than had brake capacity
[1:41:40] and long before the train missed the
[1:41:44] corner
[1:41:46] and smashed the whole city and pretty
[1:41:48] much obliterated it
[1:41:50] the engineer
[1:41:52] knew he was done
[1:41:55] and he turned to the man who lived
[1:41:57] through the wreck
[1:41:58] and he told them I guess this is the end
[1:42:05] my brother and sister God didn't call us
[1:42:08] to recognize our end
[1:42:11] as an impending wreck that's right he
[1:42:15] called us to recognize our end
[1:42:17] in the glory of Glory in the presence of
[1:42:21] the king Before the Throne at the
[1:42:23] marriage supper of the Lamb the
[1:42:24] Millennium to be able to rejoice and let
[1:42:27] me back this up here with a quote in
[1:42:28] just a just a minute let me hurry along
[1:42:30] here my oh my
[1:42:33] amen now look at this
[1:42:36] we speak of a new birth
[1:42:37] amen we hear it preached in this church
[1:42:40] quite a bit a new birth and just bear
[1:42:42] with me
[1:42:43] but what is being birthed
[1:42:47] we can talk of a new birth my brother
[1:42:49] and sister but what is being birthed
[1:42:52] Amen brother Brown talks about the
[1:42:55] spirit of denomination are we birthing
[1:42:57] that amen talking about nicolaitanism
[1:42:59] are we birthing that we need to have a
[1:43:02] clear Focus what it is we want birth in
[1:43:05] our lives do I want to be birthed into a
[1:43:07] rich man or I want to be birthed into
[1:43:09] this or birthed into that I'll tell you
[1:43:12] I want to make it public to the world
[1:43:13] Amen especially devil listen up I want
[1:43:16] to be a birthed in the kingdom of God I
[1:43:19] want to be burst in the word and I want
[1:43:21] it to come alive in me hallelujah amen
[1:43:25] there is now I hope you don't mind Mama
[1:43:28] put this out Marta it is a religious
[1:43:32] polling group
[1:43:34] and they they do all kinds of things a
[1:43:37] lot of it to do with religion
[1:43:39] and one of their latest polls is that
[1:43:42] evangelicals
[1:43:46] are falling away
[1:43:49] in a just incredible
[1:43:52] slipping Falling Away
[1:43:54] now when you go into the message
[1:43:57] you'll actually find that brother
[1:43:59] Branham has very little encouraging
[1:44:01] words to speak of the evangelicals
[1:44:07] we think wait they were kind of
[1:44:09] fundamentalists they were kind of there
[1:44:12] but you see my brother and sister
[1:44:14] they took the spirit of denomination
[1:44:17] over the word
[1:44:19] and when you take the spirit of
[1:44:21] denomination over the word it can never
[1:44:23] produce anything I've got a quote for it
[1:44:24] I'll read it to you here
[1:44:26] amen so what's happening in this Falling
[1:44:28] Away Turning Away of the evangelicals my
[1:44:31] brother and sister amen Church
[1:44:33] attendance is plummeting
[1:44:36] they literally will tell you they don't
[1:44:38] believe going to heaven has any
[1:44:40] connection to sin
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] they believe that belief
[1:44:48] is sufficient
[1:44:53] I had a brother tell me once he said you
[1:44:55] know belief is an interesting thing
[1:44:59] I believe I should own this he said but
[1:45:01] you better have enough money in your
[1:45:02] wallet before you walk out of the store
[1:45:03] with it
[1:45:04] don't care what you believe
[1:45:07] hey man I was back before shoplifting
[1:45:09] was legal
[1:45:10] you just wait it'll be very soon that
[1:45:13] shoplifting will be cons an attribute of
[1:45:16] Christians
[1:45:17] that's how far it's sliding you can be a
[1:45:19] Christian and pack out the stereo
[1:45:22] take the test drive on the car and just
[1:45:24] park it in your garage and say no while
[1:45:25] I was driving this and God said this is
[1:45:27] yours mine
[1:45:29] no my brother and sister nonsense
[1:45:31] nonsense so no connection to sin believe
[1:45:34] that belief is sufficient
[1:45:37] but I want to ask you
[1:45:39] what is belief
[1:45:43] hmm
[1:45:44] what is belief
[1:45:48] belief has to have an action does it not
[1:45:54] it says in their poll
[1:45:57] they're falling away from the belief but
[1:46:00] yet in the very connecting statement
[1:46:03] they said their beliefs have been
[1:46:06] wavering
[1:46:07] for decades
[1:46:12] so they're falling away from what
[1:46:15] the man interviewing him says so how
[1:46:19] would you describe this
[1:46:22] and he says oh they have no Direction
[1:46:27] it's been slipping they have no
[1:46:29] Direction
[1:46:30] come on Saints I hope you catch where
[1:46:32] I'm at this morning we've got to stay
[1:46:35] focused on the goal the goal has to be
[1:46:38] before us and we have to be focused on
[1:46:40] that goal or else we'll be evangelicals
[1:46:43] before very long and pretty soon we'll
[1:46:45] say well I believe God sent a prophet
[1:46:47] that's all I need
[1:46:49] oh ouch that I should have kept that to
[1:46:51] myself shouldn't I
[1:46:53] hmm
[1:46:54] look it don't put us any different than
[1:46:56] them
[1:46:57] if we come to the place that we just
[1:46:59] believe God sent a prophet malkai 4 yes
[1:47:02] got to come to pass it did Hallelujah I
[1:47:04] believe it came to pass what's that got
[1:47:07] to do with you
[1:47:09] hmm
[1:47:10] you've got a name but you've got no
[1:47:12] Authority you've got no power I cut this
[1:47:14] whole section out because I knew I'd be
[1:47:15] too long but I don't want to be one of
[1:47:17] the seven sons of Siva I don't want to
[1:47:20] walk into the devil and say in the name
[1:47:23] in the name
[1:47:25] I'm gonna say hey Paul I know you know
[1:47:28] huh
[1:47:30] no my brother and sister the name didn't
[1:47:33] mean anything to those demons there was
[1:47:35] no relationship to unfold the power of
[1:47:39] the name there was no relationship that
[1:47:42] gave them Authority and I'll tell you
[1:47:44] right now if I can sound almost selfish
[1:47:47] I want Authority I want Authority God's
[1:47:50] a power I don't need the power I need
[1:47:53] the authority that I can turn and say
[1:47:55] father I need you to come on the scene
[1:47:58] and he'll say that's my son amen that's
[1:48:01] my daughter my bride she's speaking
[1:48:04] she's asking I'm standing amen sorry for
[1:48:07] getting excited I don't want to have
[1:48:09] this I don't need titles I want the
[1:48:12] authority that comes from the
[1:48:14] relationship
[1:48:18] oh
[1:48:20] and they said that it was already there
[1:48:22] but covered
[1:48:25] deepened the rift
[1:48:28] but not their faith
[1:48:33] you know what my Bible says
[1:48:35] my Bible says run and hide from fiery
[1:48:38] traps
[1:48:39] [Laughter]
[1:48:44] no that was perfect Brother David I'm
[1:48:46] glad that you spoke that out because
[1:48:48] that's that's that that's the human
[1:48:50] reaction
[1:48:51] I retrial I'm out of here
[1:48:55] but that's not what the word says
[1:48:57] fiery trials are for the molding of our
[1:49:00] character fiery trials covet come my
[1:49:03] brother and sister as hard as covet was
[1:49:06] especially for those in other countries
[1:49:08] and states and whatever as hard as covet
[1:49:10] was it was for the benefit and blessing
[1:49:14] of the bride of Christ it caused us to
[1:49:17] stop and say what is important what do I
[1:49:19] need to do is my prayer life locking up
[1:49:22] my reading of the word oh and that's
[1:49:23] another one of the things of their poll
[1:49:25] among evangelicals the reading of the
[1:49:27] Bible is plummeting
[1:49:32] come on don't let the devil
[1:49:34] don't let the devil stop you I don't
[1:49:36] care if you have to read it from your
[1:49:37] phone I don't care if you have to
[1:49:38] whatever amen you do that sister Jerry
[1:49:41] help me get it you know phone charger
[1:49:44] I didn't know my I didn't even know the
[1:49:46] app on the phone would do that but now
[1:49:48] sitting in a tractor for hours on end I
[1:49:51] just put it on whatever book in the
[1:49:52] Bible and I want to listen to and I push
[1:49:54] the little button and it's actually
[1:49:56] quite interesting you know isn't it
[1:49:57] amazing how a real storyteller
[1:50:01] and God said
[1:50:05] the Lord help me
[1:50:08] and God replied
[1:50:10] and I'm like this is so cool
[1:50:13] this is so cool this is like almost as
[1:50:15] real as it gets amen but because it puts
[1:50:19] something in there that catches your
[1:50:21] attention I want the word to catch my
[1:50:23] attention amen I don't want to you know
[1:50:25] sit there oh I'm listening to the Bible
[1:50:26] who
[1:50:30] I don't care if it's covered I don't
[1:50:31] care what it is
[1:50:33] don't let it take your faith let it
[1:50:36] deepen your faith
[1:50:41] now
[1:50:43] just as reference we'll move real fast
[1:50:45] first Peter 4 12-19 beloved thinking not
[1:50:48] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[1:50:50] is his trial which is to try you as
[1:50:53] though some strange thing happened unto
[1:50:54] you but oftentimes we react like it was
[1:50:57] a strange thing
[1:50:58] Lord why is this happening to me Lord
[1:51:01] got the wrong address just write a
[1:51:03] little story the other day please middle
[1:51:05] of the night go down the street don't

[1:51:19] windows out they shoot tear gas in there
[1:51:21] they break furniture on the way in

[1:51:37] right individual he's got the right

[1:51:57] in all the years I've been married
[1:52:01] it's only a handful of times
[1:52:03] now I've had to ask my wife to do my
[1:52:06] laundry
[1:52:07] only a handful of times
[1:52:11] life gets busy
[1:52:13] the hampers clear full of greasy dirty
[1:52:16] Dusty clothes
[1:52:18] I get up in the morning

[1:52:46] more direct fashion never had to beat
[1:52:48] her
[1:52:49] to get my laundry done
[1:52:51] never
[1:52:53] and you know the more respect that I ask
[1:52:55] with
[1:52:57] the greater
[1:52:58] the response
[1:53:01] Lord you got to do this Lord you got to
[1:53:03] do that Lord you got to do this you've
[1:53:05] got to give me a better job you got to

[1:53:14] I love you and I thank you Lord what
[1:53:16] you've given to me
[1:53:18] I proudly bear
[1:53:21] your name amen I proudly bear identify
[1:53:26] the scripture tells us that if we would
[1:53:28] be tried with him amen test it with him
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:34] Hallelujah you know why the elect lady
[1:53:36] lives the word
[1:53:40] because she is the worst
[1:53:43] she believes the word she doesn't have
[1:53:45] to come to a question do I do this or
[1:53:47] not she realizes
[1:53:49] God called a people and I am the people
[1:53:52] amen and I'm ready to be identified by
[1:53:55] your name
[1:53:56] amen oh boy I've got so much here I've
[1:53:59] got to hurry somebody help me hurry
[1:54:01] somebody say hurry
[1:54:03] amen I figured sister Jerry would huh
[1:54:07] spoken word is the Original Seed amen
[1:54:10] bring that up and we'll just touch on
[1:54:11] that now part of it look
[1:54:15] Church Pentecostal nothing why it's
[1:54:17] hybrid seed it can't come to the word
[1:54:19] now there you are the body that gives
[1:54:22] birth to Christ's body again must come
[1:54:25] from a virgin womb the word that's why
[1:54:29] listen to this that's why she produced a
[1:54:32] million more in 44. that was about to
[1:54:35] slogan and that's why the Pentecostal
[1:54:36] denominations that could not give
[1:54:39] spiritual birth to bring forth a
[1:54:41] manifestation and the Christ because it
[1:54:43] was only a sowing rain and she's brought
[1:54:46] forth a denominational Church she
[1:54:48] Consolidated with the great evangelicals
[1:54:51] and she's gone the way of Cora she's
[1:54:53] gone with denomination so you'll see how
[1:54:56] it was my brother and sister that in
[1:54:58] that realm right there influenced they
[1:55:01] believed that it was God in the numbers
[1:55:03] while their Bible has told them if they
[1:55:06] had anointed to read it that they was a
[1:55:10] small elect group
[1:55:12] not a great group
[1:55:14] but a small elect group that met in his
[1:55:19] name
[1:55:20] not a name his name how can you have his
[1:55:24] name
[1:55:25] I'm sorry I'll just kind of put this
[1:55:26] blunt amen as I said earlier not one
[1:55:29] sister in here can come up and call me
[1:55:31] husband except for my wife she's the one
[1:55:34] that's got the name amen and so there is
[1:55:37] the bride of Christ in this hour the
[1:55:40] only one that can come and say my
[1:55:43] husband amen or even honestly in all
[1:55:47] truth Abba Father Can Only claim the
[1:55:50] position of Abba Father because they are
[1:55:53] of his seed if they're not of his seed
[1:55:56] they can claim fathership amen and can't
[1:56:00] claim that without having the proof of
[1:56:03] the spiritual DNA
[1:56:06] um
[1:56:08] let me hurry here
[1:56:10] now they speak the name I spoke on this
[1:56:12] earlier about some say it in vain they
[1:56:14] use it vulgarity some speak it with
[1:56:16] passion but not revelation
[1:56:19] my brother and sister it's not how
[1:56:20] passionate I witnessed this in my
[1:56:23] lifetime where they were praying for
[1:56:26] someone that had a need and they would
[1:56:28] grab halt of them and they would shake
[1:56:30] them like a dull Rag and because they're
[1:56:33] going to cast the spirit out but what is
[1:56:34] it my brother and sister even the
[1:56:36] denomination back in the day marveled
[1:56:38] there's men whose testimonies are
[1:56:40] recorded for Time and Eternity that they
[1:56:43] Marvel T.L Osborne's one of them
[1:56:46] marveled that he comes to this person
[1:56:48] lays hands on them and says Satan
[1:56:52] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:56:56] leave
[1:56:59] T.L Osborne you can find this testimony
[1:57:01] he said and we were used to shouting and
[1:57:04] shaken them and throwing them around and
[1:57:07] the louder we yell the more certain we
[1:57:10] were that that demon was leaving
[1:57:13] and William Branham comes and meets
[1:57:16] in the Colosseum there
[1:57:18] and he just lays his hand
[1:57:21] in the name
[1:57:23] of Jesus Christ
[1:57:26] why because there's power in that name
[1:57:29] but there's relationship that releases
[1:57:33] the power and oh God I want more of that
[1:57:36] relationship I want that relationship to
[1:57:39] flow in me flow out over me I want it to
[1:57:42] be real Hallelujah not just a form of
[1:57:45] godliness amen but I want it to be real
[1:57:49] oh look at this elect lady I need to
[1:57:52] close this up this select lady what is
[1:57:54] it she has a relationship that comes
[1:57:56] with the name
[1:57:57] she's not running around saying how do I
[1:57:59] form a relationship it has been revealed
[1:58:02] to her so the elect lady has
[1:58:04] relationship she has Revelation that
[1:58:06] come with a name she has the life that
[1:58:09] came with the name we don't get the
[1:58:10] Baptist Holy Ghost and then have to
[1:58:12] start reading books about how to be a
[1:58:15] kind good person loving and caring how
[1:58:18] to be a Christian when you have the Holy
[1:58:21] Ghost it is revealed in you amen it is
[1:58:25] exposed as it were in your life and it
[1:58:28] becomes Who You Are
[1:58:30] oh I'm trying to be a better Christian
[1:58:32] forget the trying be a bitter Christian
[1:58:35] and that means let go and let God have
[1:58:38] his way not what we can do
[1:58:41] are we okay for another minute or two
[1:58:44] Hallelujah
[1:58:45] amen why
[1:58:48] you know I love how brother Brandon
[1:58:50] brought that out I had the spirit of
[1:58:52] Dillinger
[1:58:54] whenever I have a gun in my hands out of
[1:58:56] shooting range I I understand what he's
[1:58:58] talking about Spirit tin can take this
[1:59:03] Target take this
[1:59:07] Spirit comes on you
[1:59:10] if I had the spirit of Dillinger I'd act
[1:59:12] like Dillinger
[1:59:14] and if I had the spirit
[1:59:15] Picasso or Rembrandt or whoever I would
[1:59:19] ain't like that
[1:59:24] and if I got the spirit
[1:59:27] come on
[1:59:29] if I've got the spirit
[1:59:31] I don't have to walk around did you know
[1:59:34] I'm a Christian
[1:59:36] I'm a Christian have you I've never met
[1:59:38] you before I'm a Christian
[1:59:42] better life that's right
[1:59:44] her life will speak so loud they'll say
[1:59:46] I don't know what it is with these
[1:59:48] people
[1:59:50] a camp a little sister I don't know how
[1:59:52] many of you was there when she was
[1:59:54] sharing this
[1:59:55] little sister was in a store
[1:59:58] and this woman walks up to her
[2:00:00] and says you know
[2:00:03] you don't have to dress like that and
[2:00:05] live like that to be a Christian
[2:00:08] how are we going to respond to that
[2:00:11] I loved how the sister responded she
[2:00:13] just turned to this lady and said
[2:00:16] and how did you know I was a Christian
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:26] atmosphere
[2:00:28] a life speaking the devil recognized it
[2:00:32] and said I'm gonna discourage her and
[2:00:34] she was there saying no you're not devil
[2:00:37] you're not going to discourage me
[2:00:40] thank you Lord and I'll tell you how
[2:00:43] easy that is to do sister Jerry and I
[2:00:44] was taking some college classes once and
[2:00:47] there was this lady named Carrie
[2:00:48] sometimes I see sister Kerry I think
[2:00:51] about Carrie but anyway this lady named
[2:00:53] Carrie we would go eat lunch with her
[2:00:55] and the break from classes and so one
[2:00:57] day we're sitting there eating and I
[2:00:58] said oh Carrie what church do you go to
[2:01:02] sandwich halfway to her mouth
[2:01:08] I'm a hippie
[2:01:12] oh
[2:01:14] you know why I made that mistake
[2:01:17] I looked long hair uncut
[2:01:20] looked at long dress
[2:01:22] and I just thought in our world that's a
[2:01:24] sign of a believer
[2:01:27] it also apparently is a sign
[2:01:30] of a certain sect of hippies
[2:01:35] and sometimes we make the mistake of
[2:01:36] thinking
[2:01:38] that bat makes us a believer
[2:01:42] but even hippies can be kind and polite
[2:01:45] and not use any bad language and
[2:01:49] you're with me amen what is it something
[2:01:54] in US
[2:01:55] but back to that sister
[2:01:57] she said I I didn't know how to answer
[2:01:58] and just come out
[2:02:00] how do you know
[2:02:02] I was a
[2:02:03] Christian
[2:02:05] could be she belonged to that certain
[2:02:07] sect of hippies
[2:02:10] that she didn't
[2:02:11] the devil knew that
[2:02:13] yeah
[2:02:16] amen you see God deals with us as
[2:02:19] individuals aren't you glad
[2:02:21] amen
[2:02:22] because actually it wouldn't be fair if
[2:02:24] God didn't deal with us as individuals
[2:02:26] because some of you would be punished
[2:02:28] more harshly for people like myself
[2:02:31] amen so God would have to say well I've
[2:02:33] got to deal with this whole thing
[2:02:34] imagine now when Aiken did what he did
[2:02:39] his sin
[2:02:41] caused punishment to fall on innocent
[2:02:43] people
[2:02:45] but God come now and he says I deal with
[2:02:47] you as individuals but he identifies us
[2:02:50] now look at this we're moving I'm moving
[2:02:52] really fast I know it don't look like it
[2:02:54] he deals with us as individuals but he
[2:02:57] identifies us collectively
[2:02:59] so I have to have a new birth of Jesus
[2:03:02] Christ I have to have the Holy Ghost but
[2:03:04] he looks at us and says you are my bride
[2:03:07] and he wraps his arms around every one
[2:03:09] of us and draws Us in and says you're my
[2:03:11] bride and I'm so happy to be identified
[2:03:14] with you and with him amen so what is it
[2:03:17] the word birthed people are the bride
[2:03:21] amen it's not a title we bestow because
[2:03:23] we believe the message amen there are
[2:03:26] many denominational people identify as
[2:03:28] bride it's in the scripture and they
[2:03:30] identify that but their life my brother
[2:03:33] and sister judgmental or not take it how
[2:03:34] you please their life does not identify
[2:03:37] them as a wife that is willing to please
[2:03:41] they have taken his name but they don't
[2:03:45] want anything else we'll take our own
[2:03:48] apparel you know why because he would
[2:03:51] not approve of their apparel and so they
[2:03:54] said we'll provide our own apparel so
[2:03:56] you don't judge us for our apparel and
[2:03:58] we'll provide everything else if you'll
[2:04:00] just give us a name we can deal with
[2:04:02] everything else so then they got the
[2:04:04] name they put the name over the door and
[2:04:06] then a prophet comes and lays the word
[2:04:08] out and says Whoa stop God wrote Ichabod
[2:04:12] over that door the spirit of God is
[2:04:15] departed and you say that's judgmental
[2:04:17] but I want you to understand where he
[2:04:19] was coming from he was coming from the
[2:04:21] position that if that church woman is
[2:04:24] not willing to please her husband to
[2:04:28] serve him and here again this is not
[2:04:30] subservient this is not doormat theology
[2:04:32] this is Sons and Daughters of God with
[2:04:35] balance in their life with Revelation in
[2:04:37] their life and the husband just like a
[2:04:40] pastor is called the preacher in the
[2:04:42] scripture is as it says the head of all
[2:04:45] things but he's also the servant so what
[2:04:47] does that do he's head he's servant it
[2:04:50] comes down to an even balance and we
[2:04:52] serve the man is the head he's also the
[2:04:56] servant amen it comes down to a balance
[2:04:59] and we as the bride of Christ have been
[2:05:02] granted the greatest gift that has ever
[2:05:04] been given to Mankind and we stand here
[2:05:07] and we can stick our head up in the
[2:05:09] heavenlies but over here is a flesh man
[2:05:12] that still plagues us and it brings us
[2:05:15] into balance that we know that the word
[2:05:17] has given us Liberty the word has given
[2:05:20] us life the word has given us Authority
[2:05:22] but we have a balance that God brings in
[2:05:25] our life and if you don't think so just
[2:05:27] get hitty and high-minded believer get
[2:05:30] heady and high-minded and God will knock
[2:05:32] you off your little pedestal and cause
[2:05:34] you to have to cry out and beg him for
[2:05:37] forgiveness and desire for a balance in
[2:05:39] your life
[2:05:40] excuse me I'm getting excited
[2:05:42] it's a shame I'm almost done preaching
[2:05:44] I'm excited
[2:05:46] oh now look at this here
[2:05:48] now not only the word whatever they want
[2:05:51] to say about it that's one thing or
[2:05:53] another but we know we have the
[2:05:55] scriptures right for we have the Holy
[2:05:56] Ghost as a witness Can someone say Amen
[2:05:59] the word is our Witness
[2:06:01] I I've met men I've been privileged to
[2:06:03] meet men that were with the prophet and
[2:06:05] to hear their stories firsthand to have
[2:06:07] them share that they're sitting around a
[2:06:09] campfire and they're thinking of thought
[2:06:11] and they're thinking oh how will this
[2:06:13] work out and brother Branham just speak
[2:06:15] up from looking over a cup of coffee and
[2:06:17] say brother
[2:06:18] not not a circumstance
[2:06:21] it'll work out just fine
[2:06:23] just trust God
[2:06:25] now that's either the greatest level of
[2:06:28] psychology
[2:06:30] that ever hit the land
[2:06:33] or God is present
[2:06:36] amen and I have sat here in this church
[2:06:39] while other brothers have ministered
[2:06:42] and I have stressed over things in my
[2:06:44] life
[2:06:46] and they come
[2:06:47] and what's really scary is not when the
[2:06:50] preacher preaches you're sitting over
[2:06:52] here and the preacher's like now God's
[2:06:55] going to come on the scene and
[2:06:57] but when the preacher's preaching he
[2:06:59] knows nothing I haven't even confessed
[2:07:01] it to my wife I haven't even shared it
[2:07:03] with my wife and the preachers up here
[2:07:04] preaching and he's like
[2:07:08] and you're just like wow
[2:07:11] the greatest psychological moment of my
[2:07:14] life
[2:07:15] no sir
[2:07:17] God
[2:07:18] speaking to his wife
[2:07:21] God says honey the dinner table how many
[2:07:24] times have we done it Brothers honey
[2:07:26] remember we got to pay this bill in the
[2:07:30] morning right to check and put it in the
[2:07:32] mail oh and this honey and that it's God
[2:07:35] sitting right here at our dinner table
[2:07:38] and he's speaking to us and saying you
[2:07:40] know what let go let me take care of it
[2:07:43] I'll put the money in the bank you write
[2:07:46] the check
[2:07:47] Hallelujah
[2:07:49] Lou I'm getting carried away
[2:07:51] amen God looking down through the
[2:07:53] optical eye as it was and look down
[2:07:56] through the magnifying glass and seeing
[2:07:58] the end from the beginning aren't you
[2:07:59] glad he knew these Skeptics would rise
[2:08:02] and try and twist the word in and out
[2:08:04] like that he knew
[2:08:06] every one of you has got someone in your
[2:08:08] family that is just twisted up in this
[2:08:11] my brother and sister believe but don't
[2:08:14] think God was surprised we're the one
[2:08:15] that's like oh what are we going to do
[2:08:17] God's out there saying don't worry about
[2:08:19] it I got it all in control I got it all
[2:08:21] in control you just trust me amen try
[2:08:25] and twist the word in and out like that
[2:08:26] he said I'll not leave you comfortless
[2:08:28] but I'll pray the father and he'll send
[2:08:30] you another comforter which is the Holy
[2:08:33] Ghost he will abide with you
[2:08:35] until 1950.
[2:08:40] 2020
[2:08:43] 2023
[2:08:45] December 31st midnight
[2:08:49] expired
[2:08:51] wake up in 2024
[2:08:54] and God's nowhere present with us
[2:08:57] come on my brother and sister
[2:09:00] for one who was called from the
[2:09:01] foundation of the world
[2:09:03] one who God shed his very blood amen
[2:09:07] through our Lord Jesus Christ shed his
[2:09:10] blood for us to redeem us you think
[2:09:12] you're going to wake up some morning and
[2:09:13] it's just done it's finished it's over
[2:09:15] it's expired it's canceled not a chance
[2:09:18] my brother and sister he said I'll be
[2:09:20] with you even in you and then we're
[2:09:23] going to come to the place that we
[2:09:24] recognize he's in me Can someone say
[2:09:27] he's in me amen hallelujah amen
[2:09:32] 1954 ever amen that's right forever all
[2:09:36] right and he would declare and testify
[2:09:38] of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:09:40] and forever so we have a wonderful
[2:09:43] witness of that tonight don't we that's
[2:09:46] right
[2:09:47] so what kind of people should we be then
[2:09:51] amen let's quit looking my brother and
[2:09:53] sister I'm closing
[2:09:58] what kind of people
[2:10:00] should we be
[2:10:03] now what I'm fixing to say could be so
[2:10:05] easily misconstrued
[2:10:07] but I'm going to be bold and say it
[2:10:09] anyway
[2:10:14] I don't have to look to the message
[2:10:18] to know
[2:10:19] what kind of life
[2:10:22] I should live
[2:10:26] is that confusing
[2:10:29] I don't want to be confusing
[2:10:31] so I'll clarify
[2:10:34] I don't have to go
[2:10:36] find a book
[2:10:40] oh look what's written right here sister
[2:10:42] Diane
[2:10:45] I guess I I'll live
[2:10:52] it's hard not being cynical as a
[2:10:54] preacher sometimes
[2:10:57] when you speak to somebody
[2:10:59] and you tell them
[2:11:02] and they look you in the face and say I
[2:11:05] don't agree
[2:11:08] well just a second here let me pull this
[2:11:10] book
[2:11:13] let me turn to this page right here
[2:11:16] what
[2:11:17] brother Brown said oh amen
[2:11:25] I'm probably just gonna need you more
[2:11:29] you see the reason I don't have to go to
[2:11:31] the message
[2:11:32] to see what I need to live
[2:11:35] is God rich in Mercy
[2:11:38] has made me the message
[2:11:42] I am the word
[2:11:45] made manifest
[2:11:48] I have a quote for that in case you need
[2:11:49] it
[2:11:51] so before you go I don't agree with that
[2:11:55] you see my brother and sister that's
[2:11:56] what's happening
[2:11:58] we are the word of God the life of God
[2:12:01] revelation of Jesus Christ being
[2:12:04] manifested
[2:12:06] I don't believe it because it's on a
[2:12:08] page or a tape I believe it because it's
[2:12:11] in me it's who I am
[2:12:15] the word says actually that's who I was
[2:12:18] from the foundation of the world that
[2:12:21] now I see by God's grace and mercy by
[2:12:25] the Revelation the revealing of Jesus
[2:12:28] Christ I see I always want the odd
[2:12:31] little duck in the chicken yard I always
[2:12:33] was the strange little kid in the grade
[2:12:36] school the really strange boy in the
[2:12:39] high school the really strange person on
[2:12:41] the workplace
[2:12:43] I didn't have to go the reason I'm
[2:12:46] strange is
[2:12:48] I was just strange
[2:12:52] and when we figure out why we're strange
[2:12:55] we rejoice
[2:12:57] in our strangeness
[2:13:00] hmm
[2:13:01] some of you looking at me like no I
[2:13:03] don't want to be strange
[2:13:06] well
[2:13:07] next time they sing this world is not my
[2:13:09] home
[2:13:10] please just sit down
[2:13:12] and don't sing it if you don't believe
[2:13:15] it
[2:13:17] because this world is not my own
[2:13:20] it's not where I belong it's not who I
[2:13:23] am
[2:13:24] do I have the name I'm going to sound
[2:13:26] bold or Brave boastful
[2:13:29] I have the name
[2:13:31] amen I have the name the name didn't
[2:13:33] save me in an intellectual sense
[2:13:37] it saved me in reality
[2:13:40] of who I am in Jesus Christ Can someone
[2:13:44] say amen sister Sarah would you come
[2:13:47] amen I'm afraid to look at the clock
[2:13:50] Hallelujah
[2:13:51] wow
[2:13:54] especially when I think about brother
[2:13:56] Terry sister Shelly
[2:13:58] sister Alice getting home at
[2:14:01] three in the morning now instead of two
[2:14:03] amen
[2:14:05] Lord help us
[2:14:07] you see my brother and sister
[2:14:10] we have received the life
[2:14:13] behind the name
[2:14:15] a lot of people got the name seven women
[2:14:18] packing the same name
[2:14:21] they don't have the life
[2:14:24] God said you know what if I have to go
[2:14:25] find a little spiritually orphaned girl
[2:14:30] she's not here to impress anyone else
[2:14:34] she's here to do what she needs to do
[2:14:37] and when he said I'm coming back for you
[2:14:40] she made herself ready
[2:14:43] oh God help us let's just stand
[2:14:47] God help us that we would take that
[2:14:50] of the Meat Packer's son and realize
[2:14:52] it's not just a little story but God's
[2:14:55] speaking to us
[2:14:56] to make ourselves ready to believe she
[2:15:00] had no tangible evidence let me bring it
[2:15:03] up to Modern days he didn't leave his
[2:15:05] credit card to buy her off
[2:15:08] he didn't start sending her expensive
[2:15:10] gifts as the Prosperity Gospel is trying
[2:15:13] to say God's going to do
[2:15:16] he gave her his word
[2:15:20] and said I'm coming back for you and she
[2:15:24] was there because she was of him from
[2:15:26] the foundation of the world she was
[2:15:28] there I believe it set there as it were
[2:15:31] by the candlelight and sowed that
[2:15:35] garment
[2:15:36] and she didn't have to send him an email
[2:15:38] and say now if I'm going to be your wife
[2:15:42] how should I dress myself
[2:15:48] she could already see the different
[2:15:49] Saints
[2:15:52] her cousins
[2:15:54] her cousins
[2:15:56] he didn't
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:15:59] can I elaborate the prophet's vision
[2:16:01] those girls were actually quite a bit
[2:16:04] prettier than her
[2:16:06] but brother random talked about glow and
[2:16:09] glare
[2:16:10] she glowed
[2:16:12] they glared
[2:16:14] I want to just glow with the gospel I
[2:16:16] want to grow glow with the presence of
[2:16:19] God hallelujah

[2:16:23] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:16:26] hallelujah what is that song Sister
[2:16:28] Sarah

[2:16:39] name of the Lord
