give myself away so you can use me amen have you given yourself away lose sight of your own self you have no confidence there's no confidence you can put in i can't put any confidence in david but i can put all confidence in the word amen amen amen if you've got your confidence in your abilities or your your human element your knowledge it's vain it's vanity you weren't called you weren't called to bring that to people you were called to bring life your ministry in this earth the bride's ministry in this earth is to impart life to believers you know that that day on calvary the prophet said the greater works you do the works of god but the greater works was to impart life you can't do that through psychology amen you can't do that through a mental understanding so we need to refocus what we're here for and what we are bringing our spirit realm our our pastor spoke of it sunday the thought the realm of the spirit you have a realm of the soul the realm of the spirit's the second realm but what is controlling that second realm jesus god said cast all your burden upon me cast all your cares upon me for i care for you if we try to do that some other way we're out of order amen so we must understand what we're here for god bless you thank you amen so let's stand together and let's have a word of prayer i don't think we're here in vain we're here assembled in the name of the lord jesus we've got a ministry in this hour and a message in this hour which should be our absolute because the message and the word are the same we have a perfect interpretation of the word we never had a prophet whom the word comes to come with any other thing but the word of god for our day and god had to interpret the word for our day we'd never see it in this bible amen so we must understand that we don't use we aren't using a carnal the weapons of our warfare are not carnal to bring our thoughts under obedience we are to bring them under obedience to christ we're bringing our spirit realm under obedience to christ if we're not doing that even for others we're not pointing them to christ what are you pointing them to amen prophet said the bride of christ lives by the word amen and it lives by faith in that word and faith in that faith there's only one thing that can completely deliver we don't want a band-aid we don't want a a just a a relief we want a remedy god's given us a remedy we want complete deliverance god's given us deliverance so who are we pointing the people to because your soul is going to control your spirit and your spirit will control your body so we don't want to give something to the spirit just as a relief a band-aid we want to see deliverance and we are here to impart life to those that can believe in their soul amen if we try to bring our mind and our thoughts under obedience to anything else you're out of order amen that's exactly right we are to bring our thoughts every thought under obedience to christ all right first timothy let's have a word of prayer turn to first timothy let's have a word of prayer heavenly father we know that we're not in the presence of just feelings imagination reasoning memory conscience we're in the presence of almighty god we're in the presence of the king of kings and we ought to reverence him every day not just in church but every day we live it ought to be a worship and a bowing down to the absolute the word and lord we ask that you would help us not to give ourselves over to anything but the word anything else lord that would take its position above that word is idolatrous and father we just thank you now for victory over sin over the enemy we thank you for victory over the flesh and lord let us point the people to the victory over the flesh let us point the people to the victory that will give deliverance to the things of this of their spirit bondage lord for because we we not using lord the weapons of our warfare not carnal when we when we we fight the good fight or bring under obedience lord our spirit but bringing it under the word and lord jesus we thank you for this lord and we give you praise because these we cast down everything and even knowledge that would exalt itself against the word of god and lord we're we're fighting against the strongholds of the enemy and it takes the word to break it and we thank you father because he stronghold satan wants to put strongholds in our spirit but lord no other way no other thing was it god given and given us to do but bring the truth to the people to deliver now father we ask you to bring deliverance through your word as we continue on this little subject of in her alone lord we just ask you to open it up and lord have your way tonight i am your servant these lips are your lips my mouth is your mouth and lord i expect and do and will bring forth your words your thoughts in word for your glory and honor and by your power not by anything i can do or think or say but lord give revelation to your people give revelation to your bride let us walk in that faith because that's the only thing that's going to be received by god nothing else faith in your promise in your word in jesus name we pray amen first timothy 3 16. i want to continue with the subject in her alone and that's course the bride in her alone part two and god's great mystery secret beyond the curtain of time revealed it's quite a subject but i'll probably go beyond that subject but my title is in her alone i'm part two and god's great mystery seek it secret god's great mystery secret beyond the curtain of time has been and is being revealed to his bride and to do this we are not looking at the things that are seen we are looking at the unseen we are seeing what god sees we are seeing and should be seeing what god sees amen amen so we want to be careful where we're feeding if we're not feeding on the things of god what are you feeding on in this day an hour we're not bringing the word to the people what is our position we should be a living epistle known and read of all men a living epistle a written word made manifest in this hour people don't take the message serious enough they don't realize who's among us we've had we have the son of man among us and we had the son of man we saw the son of man manifesting itself through a son of man we saw the word made flesh and this message in this hour will bring the word made flesh to his bride and again it's the son of man revealed she's not another she is him so what are we bringing what are we doing bringing knowledge or bringing revelation to the people and without controversy verse 16 and without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of godliness god was manifested in was manifest in the flesh how many say amen god was manifest in the flesh and i trust by the time this service ends you'll see that god is manifested in the flesh and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness or god likeness being like god god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit that's capital s justified in the spirit not not but notice in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory amen you may be seated i'd like you to turn with me to ephesians chapter one and we'll move in that just a moment ephesians chapter one notice brother branham i'm quoting from the message unveiling of god notice like the sculpture he hides with a mask over it now i want to i want to say this also before i go there revelation 10 7 remember what it said we realize that the ministry of the seventh angel which should be our ministry because the ministry of jesus christ and the ministry of the bride is the same ministry it's not another ministry so what are we ministering amen we need to get our focus right so the ministry of the bride and the ministry of jesus christ will be absolutely the same because they can't be different they are different physically but they're not different spiritually amen they are one all right they are the same person in fact it's coming right down to where where the bride and the groom are the same person it's the same person all right okay now revelation 10 7 said this mystery of revelations 10. there's a great mystery here that god kept secret in the back part of his mind since before the foundation of the world and would not have let it be revealed until this day and it was the mystery of his coming because there's there's a mystery that's been sealed in those seven seals and there's a mystery in every one of those ages that had been revealed but they were kept hid in fact god from the beginning of time in genesis he he showed it in his original creation what the mystery was and then he hid it amen he wouldn't let it out he wouldn't let it out he showed it he just gradually he kept showing it but it was hid from the people until this hour until these seals were taken off of this book off of the complete revelation of jesus christ this could not be known amen amen we got quite a message the devil will do everything he can to get you away from that message you'll get your focus on something else away from this message but the bride is a special called people who are called to a special placing and position and that position is in heavenly places in christ and we ought not to be flirting with other things the devil the devil will reason with you he'll make things look reasonable but god doesn't do things down your reasoning alley god does things by his word he works through faith in his word amen amen so the revelation 10 message is the seventh seal and it's the complete revelation of jesus christ it's a complete it's the mystery of his coming which lays in this book amen that has been opened the mystery of god mis the mystery at the day of the sev the day of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished that finish means completed and it wouldn't be until the end in fact the opening of that of that seventh seal was the sign that we have arrived the end is here and there's a mystery coming through the people that's not known the mystery we're talking about here is not and cannot be known to the public brother branham said and i quote this seventh seal is not to be known to the public until she leaves the bride leaves we've come as far as the sixth seal and brother brown said this seventh seal cannot be known to the public until that time what time the sixth seal opens and that's to israel and that's during the tribulation period she gets their message of his coming and it seals away a hundred and forty four thousand amen you see you see we we this situation this mystery that that the bride holds by revelation is not something you can mentally conceive you don't figure it out you don't study it it doesn't come that way it comes by revelation and then it lives that revelation out of you amen all right so but this mystery should be completed the mystery notice it's the mystery of god the mystery of god should be completed and it is and it will be the seventh seal not known to the public brother bram said the seventh seal is not known to the public what is now his coming and the hour of his coming is not known to the public his coming and the hour of his coming is not known the public because what's revealed is the thing jesus said i don't know only my father but when he was glorified and went up and the book of revelation become written and john wrote what he here here he begins to unveil that mystery that was a sealed mystery you say well it can never be known no yes it is brother branham said the christ the mystery god revealed i'm going to preach it and by the end of this sermon you will understand the mystery that i have been able now able to re to make known to you he said on the seventh seal he said he said all of you know i know what that is but i got to stop right here amen but in christ the mystery if you go back and look at it christ's mystery said how he would come would be revealed amen it was a secret but it can't be known to the public who is it known in her alone this is the thing that excites the bride because when they see that and realize that they are that predestinated seed for this hour and time in this complete revelation jesus christ is his the seed but he had to complete the revelation of himself how by becoming his bride he had to become bride there was a revealing that it was a revealing of himself that had to be known that was a mystery that was a secret but now he steps forth and makes it known and he comes forth in the bride form but it couldn't be done until the end of the ages because now this mystery can be made known and by making it known we come out of that dark denominationalism and fulfill the the bride coming of christ it's christ in bright form and that purpose of that is to bring us together as one family is to bring us together under the full under the under the under the manifestation i'm gonna get i'm getting ahead of myself here for sunday but under the manifestation because something had to manifest his generation who would make known his generation he was cut off from the land of living for the transgression of my people was he slain what for the seed all right now i'll believe that all right now so the now his coming and the hour is coming and not known to the public let me finish here now what we're looking into now the sculpture he hides with a mask over it the sculpture that's what god has done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hid and is supposed to be he said to the age but is supposed to be revealed in this age who would hold the mystery a prophet because these things could not be known without it coming to a prophet because the prophet would be the revealer god's word comes to his prophets so the interpretation coming through a prophet is not a private interpretation it's god's interpretation and let me go a little further than that every seed of god son of god is the interpretation of the word for this hour not the interpreter the interpretation of it see you're fulfilling prophecy you're fulfilling the word for this age amen all right so it's got to be manifest in someone because because this it had to come to a full complete revelation the the the seal had to be broken that was sealed in an earthen vessel the mystery was in the earth and vessel we find that portrayed in genesis 2. amen what about revelations of the revelation of jesus christ where is that vessel had to be broken and it was the smiting of christ was for a purpose brother brown masterpiece 1963 he said the smiting of crier 64. i don't remember the smiting of christ was for a purpose that he might take one to be his bride amen where was that sealed where was that coming from but he still kept it a mystery full mystery until the revelation of this seven seals he couldn't let it out amen but now satan can't do anything about it it's too late now these things are revealed to the bride and there's multitudes upon malta i'm not saying who is and who is it that will miss it they miss this revelation why they're not born again so let me continue on with this here i'm not saying who is and who isn't but there's a definite reality to the new birth he said and it's to be revealed these things have been masked over and hid now is to be revealed in this age he's speaking here in the unveiling of god how many know he said god has come in full view of you little ones full view not a partial view the full view god has come in full view of you bride but still hid one sees a man brother bam said the other sees god one saw man but the other saw the son of man revealing himself through a son of man to get into the bride himself to be in that form that then again would be what the revealing of the son of man what's happening today it's the revealing of the son of man amen all right so he said it's now the bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is amen all right now that's what the bible has been it's been a work of god that's been covered up brother branham said in the in these seven ages he's been forming his bride making her amen the smiting of christ was for a purpose is that right that he may bring one a bride the full what full maturity full headship to the revelation that we're not two separate people the head and the body have become one unit they're no longer twain they're one amen i know these are pretty strong statements but this is the message all right now he said that's what the bible's been it's been a work of god it's been covered over covered up until it's revealed and god promised in this day the age of the will see in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it he said what a glorious thing i say what a glorious view amen it's the whole thing's removed and he said and it's not a partial revelation we have the complete revelation and everything we need to make a rapture is in those that have the holy ghost living in them because everything you need in this journey is in you so where's your confidence laying in theology of a man in a code of rules or code of ethics or in the word amen all right don't let sidetrack don't you let the devil sidetrack you let god open your eyes and take authority over these things and place the word in its position where it belongs amen over your life over your home over these things god in morphy you know what a morphe means god in morphe changes his mask same god not another one it's the same person there isn't two or three gods it's one god one person christ god above us god with us in the form of son god in us bride form amen same god all right he said oh god a morphe mask in the pillar of fire god and morphy in a man he see here's god above us god and morphy and a man called jesus god with us god and morphy and his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god amen think of it god would become that simple come down here and live in this old 70 year old lump of clay called david and reveal his name reveal his seed reveal himself showing that before the foundation of the world i was in the thinking of himself amen he said how do you know because i have a token that identifies itself with the word amen that's it the assurance the identification his own literal life acting out living out holding keeping us straight in the word amen amen amen all right god and morphy all right up there holy no one could touch him god with us are above us he settled upon the mountain and even an animal touched the mountain had to die and then god came down and changed his tent and came down and lived with us become one of us brother branham said the whole revelation from genesis to revelation is god becoming materialized another place he said god becoming tangible god becoming tangible god becoming among us how could he do that by the cleansing power of the blood which carries the life he could sanctify a people that he could come and live in and quicken that seed in the soul the seed is in the soul not in the spirit it's in the soul a person can be anointed in the spirit cast out devils just like judas and move by the power of god and work by the power of god and be a devil in his soul that's exactly right how do you know you're in god because this word of this hour is revealed to you you have an ear to hear what the spirit's saying you're not driven over here to one side amen you know what the devil did to eve he reasoned with her got off of that one word instead of accepting it he reasoned why god would not do what he said he would do and gave her a reason why and she bit off the tree of knowledge and people have been biting every sense he never asked us to figure out anything he asked us to take that word and accept it and live with it what are we presenting to anyone else we need to get our priority right what the bible say to do he said he said well in habakkuk i had that other words just search yourselves consider your ways that's it and then god came down and changed his tent and become one of us he lived with us became one of us we beheld him first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is a mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh handled with hands god eat meat god drank water god slept god eat meats today god drinks water god sleeps god cried he was one of us beautiful typed in the bible that was god above us that was god with us now he said it's god in us no i am not myself all of god i'm a measure you're a measure you're a spoonful i'm a spoonful but without your spoonful i'm not complete without my spoonful you're not complete so god is manifested in a many member body which is his dwelling place in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you but i go prepare a place for you and i will come again just what he's been doing just write what he's been doing all along he's been coming again receiving you unto himself by the revealing of the word the revealing of himself that you may be where he is amen without this without the bible being revealed without these mysteries being opened amen in you how are you going to make a rapture amen it's got to be opened in you this message just come out to flow down the air it's got to have somebody to manifest it it's got to be manifested amen you're not just some little something here it's jesus christ in the formation of the bride today you want the quote on that i've got it amen okay but that's the word all right so great is that mystery of godliness today for god is manifested in the flesh today who is god a book of rules and regulations no he's the word amen amen and the word the bible the word is the complete revelation of jesus christ and brother branham said which is his body the complete revelation of jesus christ is his body all right now let's turn to ephesians chapter one i want to get something down here tonight before we close so i want to just make sure i get to it ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ heavenly places in christ is the believer's position don't let the devil put you out of your position by feeding you garbage he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him how did he choose us in him by foreknowledge first peter 1 2 said the elect according to foreknowledge amen there's a lot of others in the fore knowledge of god too that were elect but we're talking about the bride tonight you may not know that but there is and we're going to go into that lord willing sunday and monday wednesday all right now let's read recording as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children placing of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved already accepted in whom we have redemption through the blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself now watch this that in the dispensation of the fullness of times we have arrived that is our dispensation in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him if you hold your place there and go to galatians chapter 4. and let's look at something here just back a few pages here chapter four and verse five or four it also says jesus coming forth here to redeem his people he said but when the fullness of time was come notice when verse 10 it said the dispensation of the fullness of times over here it says when the fullness and when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made after the law now that's exactly what we just read god with us he come through a woman so as the bride come through carriers as the life in the wheat plant she was the seed that went in the ground she's the seed here that has come out of the carrier the shack which the shuck has dried up and it's dead we don't have a shock message today we have the message of the seed this is seed time life is in the grain again what life the same life the same word the same christ the same jesus the revealed word in the bride form amen life is in the grain what is the word life amen life and death are coming to their final struggle too amen that's right all right but you see the fullness of time now we have come here to the fullness of times what is it now god's here in another form not another person the same person brother branham said not another person not a third person god in us not a third person the same person amen all right now so we see then in verse if we go further here okay i just think i'll stop right there now the new birth let's read you know colossians just a moment colossians 1. 127 very familiar scripture 127-28 to whom god even the mystery which god has been hid from ages and from generations now we're talking about a mystery we're talking about a secret that god has hid that hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom now see they saw that mystery revealed they saw god come down in human form they saw him step forth and paul catching the further revelation knew that that god was in him that's the origin that's original faith that's the faith of the fathers amen all right he said now but he said even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from from ages past and their ages in time because even paul said i could speak of bear rack and jephthy and samson and all these and he said go on down who the world's not worthy and he said and without us paul's saying without us they can't be made perfect now we're standing here in this age and saying without us they can't be made perfect in fact the whole perfection of perfection came in this day and paul was looking for that to come peter the prophets were looking for this day that when perfection of the perfection of himself they knew something more was coming they didn't have revelation the book of revelations written at that time but we have the book of revelations we have a little book called the book the revelation of jesus christ and he had that book in his hand in revelation 10 2 and it was a sealed book not anymore there's a mystery revealed here all right the new birth the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery it isn't because you shouted it isn't because you cast out devils a devil can you the holy spirit can use that devil to do that did you know that he did judas judas by the holy spirit cast out devil now say that isn't right anointed to do it brother brown said the same anointing he said the holy spirit can anoint your spirit to do those works and be as smutty as black as dark in your soul amen see that's one of the mysteries that had to be opened in this day but that holy ghost ever falls upon a predestinated seed that's been planted by predestination and that soul falls on good ground it's going to bring forth a hundredfold and fiftyfold and thirtyfold amen it's gonna do it and it'll recognize the word for their dour and time and it won't feed on any nonsense of the world because they recognize their position an hour listen i'm not going to pet that devil amen he's always been reasoning against the word and any and knowledge against the word and his ways are against the word and ever so subtle but looks so reasonable and beautiful but notice his altar of worship was refused cain was refused and cain was wroth with god he said who do you think you are a little two bit by two by four brother of mine i'm the firstborn so he thought but he wasn't the firstborn of abel or adam amen is that right but i'm firstborn i come through the same mother you come from hello that's what they say today i got the same mother you know my pentecost is my mother but that old pentecost went off to denomination as a shock and the real pentecost which is the baptism of the holy ghost upon a word seed and that soul is the new birth and that's a divine revelation and that will continue right on into the revelation of the word of this hour and if you can't discern what you're doing that's off the word then you need the holy ghost the holy ghost isn't going to turn away from this word it's not going to try to do something contrary to the word i don't care how nice the knowledge looks amen now check it with a word the problem is we aren't going back to the word and why not you say it's right before me why can't you see that then why can't you discern it the holy ghost in you will be a discerner of those spirits i don't care how close they are they're not going to be able to seduce they would try to seduce the bride if it was possible but that's not possible amen quit your flirting with the other man brother brahm said you if you come with any kind of reasoning contrary to god's word you're flirting with another man your flirt no he said you're flirting with the devil amen third seal you'll see you're trying to use something that god hasn't provided to bring deliverance to spirit to that spirit realm i'm talking about the holy spirit i'm talking about your spirit realm bondage is not delivered all you're doing is bringing a little feeling but you're not bringing the word for deliverance all right brother brown here here's the new birth christ in revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery amen god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth what are we what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word through his word through his word by the same actions the same things he did he did making the word manifest or if the church only knew its position brother baum said i've introduced you to him oh he said if the church could only get her positive position another place positive position or if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is amen when it knows what it is where's the thing you're using leading you down what trail what what what way is it going here what's the fruit of it but the revelation come through the blood see through jesus christ who is the blood of god created blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today the only way you know him is by revelation that god has revealed the word to you it is the word it is he is the word and the word how how you know it's revealed it lives it and expresses itself through you that word does the only way you're saved is by revelation the only way you're saved is know him know him by revelation only way is by revelation his church is himself revealed his church is himself revealed do you see it and expressed by the word itself and expressed by the word itself that he is god these who are the royal seed are the elect of god these who are the royal seed are the elect of god are they predestinated for known of god and we're in the mind of god and his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the decreed in their designated decreed season they couldn't be expressed but they were the word they were in the word they were a part of eternal life they were in the word himself but not expressed other words they're a thought what is a word it's a thought expressed but not expressed until their designated decreed season this is your designated season this is your decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body remember the body is himself revealed the body is the word revealed do you think that body then is going to express him and then leave off a little part and just take everything else but one little section and go out there contrary to the word thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride this bride the spoken word is the original seed this bride is the original seed it's the spoken word bride and though she is feminine in designation brother paul brought that out here i think it was last sunday or sunday before or something wednesday though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and she came from the same source every seed shall bring forth of its kind the only way that that seed can come and be manifest jesus christ it had to come from the source he came from you come from the same source was eternal with him and now manifesting god and now you're manifesting god or the bride is manifesting god in a many many membered body whereas once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ amen now i i just to save time abraham or excuse me adam there was a sealed mystery in himself god expressing himself because the image of god was male and female the image of god was man which was male and female when god when jesus christ went to calvary on the cross he was both masculine and feminine then what was it that he was smitten for that she that the she that is in him amen that same life would produce itself in a bright form which would be him it's not another it's him eve was him mrs adam was expressing mr adam mrs adam was revealing mr adam in another form that was the culmination that was the capping of creation that was the capstone of god of god's work and creative act when he brought man was both male and female and then took out of that man the mystery of adam mrs adam was the mystery of mr adam revealed so is it today we can't fall because he didn't fail that first adam fell this second adam won't fall and therefore we can't fail being in him and a part of him always were in eternal life we never were a part of eternal life and then taken out of eternal life we'll get into that more on sunday there's a reason for that you say well how can some have eternal life and then be re well how can some excuse me be in the book of life written and then removed their name removed the mystery isn't it lord willing i want to get there that's something had been in my heart probably four years or better so we'll just see how the lord i would desire you pray for me upon this rock of revelation of who jesus christ is he's the full he is the full manifested god upon this rock revelation i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never shake it down never prevail against it you think about those in ukraine psalm 91 said the thousands shall fallen i forget the left to right hand and ten thousand on the other but it shall not come nigh them just think about that there's nothing there's no devils in hell can take the bride out of her position nothing the war should rise against me psalm 27 and this will i be confident one thing i've desired see the war should rise against me what does that mean anything to the bride just start rejoicing anyway say well we don't have food and water well are you limiting the creator that created your body to provide food and water you say you're not in it no but i pray that god's grace and mercy by the revealing of that word would place us right if we have to be put in it we know the bride's going is very close amen then let's get down to business with this word this book and start eating the book if you want to study something starting the book start eating the book quit running from the presents and run into the presence of god start eating the open word john was told by the angel take the book the little book and eat it up take that bride book take that take that marriage certificate take that word that full revelation of myself which you are john john heard it thunder he knew what it said amen oh you say well the seven things seventh seal will never be known i beg your pardon john knew what it said it was revealed in those seven thunders and the brother brown said it's the thing that jesus said no man but the father knew that's his coming he said so see those seven thunders hold that mystery and it's connected together amen all right now so why do you put so much emphasis on that because that's our time that's where we're at the seed again the seed again it's jesus christ again do we recognize i don't think people i know there's not many recognize that they'd be more serious about what they're believing amen okay i know i've got to hurry i want to get to a spot here i'm not going to make it and everything look christ in you makes him the center of life of that revelation amen he said see christ's life in you makes him the center of that revelation he's the center is he the center everything will revolve around the center everything the wheel outside wheel will revolve around the little wheel so if you see your life revolving around a little wheel and it happens to be the word what's taking you away from it then because you if that word's down in your soul it's going to hold you straight and it's going to reveal to your air and you're going to make it right and you'll lose your fear of what anybody else thinks and bring these things under headship amen all right now so christ in the bible makes the bible what the complete revelation of christ is that right christ in the bible would make the bible the complete revelation of christ and that's his body okay christ in you i didn't read colossians 1 27 to whom god would make known this mystery but is now made manifest to his saints how god what god to whom god would make known what is the riches of the myth glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach amen warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus you can't do that without the revelation of the word of this hour we're preaching to others to the little bride you're perfect in christ the devil said oh you can't be perfect he's not pointing to the right correct side he'll take you away from the revelation in your soul and give you something to reason over make it feel good we don't believe in a feel-good religion quit petting the devil we've got to go through struggles and trials we have to go through testings but there's only one thing that's going to deliver you from that stronghold and that's the word of god not a carnal warfare amen casting down strongholds how you going to cast them down by the way the word said to do it then why are you trying to do it another way you say brother david would you preach like that i would certainly preach like this because it's not david amen abel just simply come up by revelation and offered the lamb don't you see brother how much i've labored and how much i brought and how much beautiful this altar and this church is i put all this time in it i've grown the plants and and i've grown these things and i've labored and i've labored and i've worked and i've worked and here you come along and just by you say oh by revelation you had and brought the lamb and put a few stones together and laid him on it and gave the life god accepted it by revelation don't you see how hard i've worked and how much i've studied and how much i've done to learn this you don't learn the word of god it's revealed to you and turn right around there and and and roth and jealous because his brother was accepted and god said you'll do good if you just do what your brother does i'll receive you could he do it no why wrong seed wouldn't receive the word it was all by works it was a works it was a knowledge affair the devil's been good at that ever since he got eve over amen god hasn't asked us to do any of those things what he asked you to do was believe what he said and spread the gospel all right amen so christ in you makes you what the complete revelation of the whole thing what a position makes you the complete revelation of what thing whole thing what is that the word what that little book seal sealed the book of revelation because the book of revelation was the full reveled word was the full revelation of jesus christ manifested in bright form so you are the message so you are the living word you're a living stone you're an elect lady you're his queen you're his bride you are him and he's you well they all sound good don't they but let it be revealed in you and it takes on another dimension it's called the third dimension the third realm the third pull it's opening of the word you see in order for eve to come out the word had to be opened the book had to be opened amen adam was a living book he was a living god that god had to be opened he had to open himself in order for the bride to be manifested amen the bard the bride is a part of the bridegroom any like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour what is that word bride what's her position the manifestation of this hour the word himself revealed himself revealed and what do we see what are you seeing the son of man revealed again don't you judge him by your outside mistakes and your heirs amen he's not going to be judged that way you can be judged by the word in you that's what he's looking at that's how you're judged the token has to be on display you can't do that through your intellects you can't do that through your works you can't do that by pumping up and pressing in and studying something you can't do it that way it's sovereignly and divinely given to you by grace amen if there's that in your heart to receive it it's god's achievement not yours it's god's achievement not yours amen so but what is the bride not a creed or denomination not a living but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride amen that's that's to come in this hour to be expressed excuse me that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living amen the inside man the inside of that man the inside of the flesh man brother branham said the inside of that flesh man is a man called spirit amen inside of that spirit is a is a realm called the soul and that soul if it's not the word it never will be amen god had to be had god had to place that there the word's not there you may do all kinds of signs and miracles and you'll lean towards your knowledge but you'll never get a true revelation of the word for the hour you see we don't like the way you preach it's okay you don't have to like the way i preach i'm going to tell you the truth regardless amen amen all right i planted it i put their names on the book before the foundation of the world by predestination i'll water it and just keep moving i'll furnish the water you keep moving i'll you just spray it out i'll water it day and night unless one of them gets plucked out of my hand there you are i believe god has to plant the word amen the bride is part of her husband the church is a part of the word the manifest the manifestation god's manifested word of god today is his bride he that believeth in me not believe believe on me but believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also why it's his life it's his dynamics in his mechanics that's in you fires it off see the mechanics is the word see i believe the word i believe the word where's the dynamics to fire the word and you say well i believe the word and then live the word for another day oh you're going to live if that seeds here you're going to live the word for this day it's got to amen your spiritual your physical contacts the spirit physical your spiritual contacts are spiritual your spiritual realm your spirit realm has five senses imagination memory reason conscience and memory and imagination is that right contacts the spiritual there's only one thing that contacts the spiritual in your soul it's either god or satan and if it's of god there's only one thing that's faith in that word amen all right and if that spirit's not controlled by the word it won't last it won't do it it won't do a big good because you're going to do what's in your soul regardless of what that spirit whatever that spirit does it can be anointed to do it but unless that soul is right with the word you'll always come back to what that soul is because who you really are is your soul that's who you are amen amen all right so your spiritual context is spiritual but the inside of that spiritual you've got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from god amen there you are gene is a part of generations all right now i gotta i'm trying to rush through this because i gotta quit now when we see god makes his promise live before us and see what it's what it is in us his spirit is living in us this spirit is living in us that is the only way to worship and that's the only place of worship you try to bring any other means to relieve the cares or release the cares of an individual outside of this word you're contrary to the word you're working against the word amen because he already said he's the one that you cast your cares on amen all right okay the invisible union of the bride of christ if you're married to christ christ is the word of god any son natural son is the attribute of his father and just as you were the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the betting grounds of a church of the church spiritually i'm thinking of but the betting grounds of your mother natural you were brought into the earth and become in the image of your father then he could fellowship with you so were you sons of god and daughters of god before there was even a moon stars or a molecule you were sons and daughters of god you were you are the only you are for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god in the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you why because you were in eternal life you if i'm in my father then i come in the form image of my father but you're in your father god then there's only one form of eternal life we know that's god and if there's only one form of eternal life that was you okay before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when he was in your earthly father but you are manifested in his image in the image of god you were made and you were manifested for the glory and fellowship of god and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in god because your expression of the attributes of his thoughts do you realize your have thoughts expressed today when he when he showed when when melchizedek met abraham you were in him right there when the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was the word and the word is with god you were there the only thing you did is personally bypass that theophany but you were in that theophany you were in melchizedek when he appeared abraham because everything you are was in christ and all that you are is him and all that he all that you are is him and all that he is you are that's a brother brah made that statement unveiling of god i was there when moses did this i was there when jesus i was there when melchizedek made abraham i was there if levi was there paying tithes where was i where were you amen and he was in the loins of abraham when melchizedek met him you being a part of god before the foundation of the world when god became a man stepped forth in a theophany you were there in that right there and now in this day the word's been opened up and you've heard from your theophany and you're about ready to go into it at least i am and maybe one of you others may leave before i do we don't know do we let's be prepared what if a man gains a whole world and loses his soul what does it profit him amen let's make sure that our desires and our ambitions are centered on the word our focus is on the word and we're bringing forth the fruit of the word amen that's exactly right you're a branch he's the vine you bear the fruit of the vine now if what you're bearing and what you're doing isn't bearing that fruit because that vine is a certain quality if it isn't doing it i'd say i'd run away from it as fast as you can amen all right move right down here and i'll close here just a second well not a second but two or three minutes the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind amen amen the church bride in the last days comes to the headstone headstone comes to her amen we could just show you right now right now that that headstone that capstone this message brother braham said is the capstone message it caps the whole thing off he said we've we've come to the place he said where bride and and the head have become one he's uniting with his body they are becoming one oh no we don't we don't have the oh yes we have the capstone amen we are one then from then from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ a beloved bride a virgin of his word you know who the bride is she's a virgin born word of god did you know that she's a virgin-born word of god made manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever she's a virgin-born word of god made manifest who is she jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and what would he do if you're doing what you're doing all right through them he's a virgin they're a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man made creeds or dogmas through them and by them will be fulfilled all that's been promised for his word in the virgin brother brown said there are certain things he could not fulfill when he was here on earth so now he works in and through his bride it wasn't time for him to work then in that but now it is amen okay okay let's go just just a little further here the word of promise now listen to this i want you not to catch this i mean i want you to catch this watch what he says here this what spurred me actually to take part two here the word of promise who is he he's the word of promise isn't he the word of promise watch how the prophet words this the word of that member that's pick up your pen and write this wasn't brother brown's writing this was god writing through his pen this is god speaking in a love letter to his bride i don't believe god minced the words here he said the word of promise in himself that a strange statement the word of promise in himself well who would be himself the bride the word of promise in his bride god himself made manifest amen god himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so the word of promise is in himself and god then comes and quickens himself to manifest himself reveals quickens his word of himself because his bride is himself the word of promise comes in himself amen god himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise as to fulfill all that's been written of him as he did when he came from the virgin womb which is a type of the spirit womb now so will the virgin now accepting his word be it unto me see so will the virgin now accepting his word amen be it unto me as thou hast said though was said by an angel yet while it was while it yet was written in the word there you are that's exactly what we've received by an angel they will love him and love his and have his potentials for he is their head he is their head nothing else is their head make sure who your head is he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of christ was his all right here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with what the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord amen for it is himself in them continuing to fulfill his word amen when now see now god's word is embodied in the bride just like it was embodied in jesus christ brother and said now it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us to desperation that eternal great mystery that god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ and given right down to his church first fold second fold of the threefold purpose of the seventh seal that's god unfolding his purpose he kept that a mystery but all that god was he poured into jesus christ all that jesus christ was he poured down into his church and once what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ amen jesus making love to his church his bride whispering secrets to her and why is this four so we can step out into a millennium and have the family back together the full revealed word amen when john saw this book taken john recognized his name to be in that book john saw his name and he said everything heard me speak everything heard me scream everything heard me say amen blessings honor brother branham said he must have caught the vision he saw himself beyond the curtain of time he saw what god saw amen and the prophet said the mystery of this book when that mystery was revealed he saw his name he caught his name right there so who is the what is the revelation of that book you are you're the mystery you're the mystery revealed the mystery of christ revealed amen let's stand brother branham said you can't mix i don't want you to miss this you can't mix knowledge and the word together amen you can't mix knowledge with god's word just don't ever forget that amen you can't mix knowledge with god's word the word is to believe by faith is to be believed by faith not knowledge you don't understand it you accept it amen you say it's right and then you live by it that's all he asks you to do amen amen i could go a lot further but we'll stop do you love him amen i i just can't get enough it's so much there's so much now this mystery this secret this secret this mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride he said only that's the only one could see it amen so has he come in full view see brother brahm said god has come in full view and he's coming in full view of us to us he is coming in full view to us but brother branham knowing the message of the hour said he's come and fooled you to you so what are we to do eat the book and let him become more and more in view to us amen amen praise the lord in christ alone it's only in christ alone how am i a part of this how am i a part of the book how am i a part of it brother brown said here it is it's in me that's how i'm part of it it's in me the secret is only known to her amen aren't you glad you're one of them the devil's howling about the truth of this revealed mystery trying to shut her up form an organization to shut her up the brother brown said she won't be shut up she'll be taken up amen she will be taken up nothing can stop her nothing going to stop her because she's bringing forth of his kind amen she is his kind amen there's other scriptures that i hadn't got to but lord willing brother branham said this he said the real you is the holy spirit in you if you go to first corinthians 15 you'll find out there's an inner man and an outer man and the bible said the inside man was the spirit word the bible said it was the quickening spirit that's the holy spirit so who are you who's the real you this old coat that you wear out here isn't who you are that's not the real you the real you is on the inside that soul that can either accept or reject the word in its season will either see it or not see it how many want to see it how many longs to see it more what are you going to do to get it faith comes by hearing the word eat the book amen eat the book [Music] hallelujah amen in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is christ sing alone verse gear chorus in christ alone where do you put your trust i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory let it be said i'll be my source of strength my source of hope is christ alone amen amen there's another song in the in the word alone something about the word alone and i can't catch what that is well never mind i just there's another one we sing and it's not maybe word alone but it's in the word oh my well anyway it's a short one like that similar all right let's sing um oh what's that one this is his house amen
