Above all kingom, above all thrones, above all wonderers that the world has a overnown above all wealth and treesures of the earth. There's no way to measure what your worth. Crucified, laid behind a stone, live to die. Rejected and alone like a road trampled on the ground. You took the fall and you thought of me above all. Let's just stand as we sing this one more time. You know, in courts when the judge comes in, they stand for him. We're standing for the king of all. King of my life. Hallelujah.

Crucified, laid behind a stone. live to die. Been rejected and alone, trampled on the ground. You looked before and thought of me above all. You were cruel see fire. You were laid behind the storm. You live to die. Oh, rejected and alone like a rose. You were trampled on the ground. You took my fall and thought of me above all. Could we just thank the Lord this morning? He took the fall for you and I. Something that we did not deserve, but he says, "I've come for you. I've paid a price. You're no longer of this world, but you belong to a heavenly kingdom. You're my child. Oh, thank you, Lord. We have so much to thank you for, Lord. Just ask you, Father, just touch each and everyone today, Lord. Let us know with true appreciation, Father, what you've done for us. How we bless your holy name. You're worthy, Father. Worthy of all of our praise. You're worthy of our lives, Lord. Father, we just come this morning, Lord, just Father, desiring to hear from you, Lord, that you would just speak, Father, through your word to each heart, Lord, how we love you and adore you. Oh, Father, we thank you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Good to be in the house of the Lord today. Amen. Very happy. our dear friends, brother Jeremy and sister Emily, God bless you all the way down from the uh Washington, British Columbia area up there and uh thankful for them. Brother Moses, God bless you, my friend. We finally are going to connect. Amen. Sister Denell, Job, God bless each and every one of you to see and uh uh we just uh are very thankful for all that the Lord has done. And uh we have we didn't sufficiently greet them this last week, but um our sister Helen and her children. Amen. We're just happy to have them here with us. And I have the workbooks for for the the kids that we had talked about. So we want to give those to you today. And uh my dear friend Cody and his mother, Sister Lois. Amen. So happy to see them back again. And each one, brother Daniel, just thankful in my heart today. There's a body of believers of people who are responding to the word of God. You didn't come because the preaching so great. There's greater preachers out here. Maybe even just down the street, men that are more gifted. But you know, is it that is a saying that I've held to a long time. What it takes to catch the people is what it will take to keep the people. And great preaching, my brother and sister, is good for a season. But if we have not overcome the world, the preaching won't overcome it for us. We have to have the very presence, the very spirit, the Holy Ghost in us is the only way we're going to overcome this world. Amen. But I thank God because he has given us the ability to receive the word. Can we say amen to that this morning? Amen. It's that ability to say amen to the word that will change our lives. Amen. Sometimes it might hurt a little bit and and we'll think, "Oh, that's that's difficult." But there's something inside of us that can't help but say, "Amen." So be it in my life, Lord. And so thankful to be here today. Amen. God bless you. Amen. I just want to bring uh greetings to you from Brother Jonah up in Colona. Brother Jonah is just such a faithful brother. every Sunday morning he sends me a text and and uh I appreciate that. He's always just encouraging. He just wants to encourage. Amen. And so, greetings from Brother Jonah. Brother Jose brings greetings to you also this morning. Amen. We just appreciate these men uh in their own way, in their own communities. They're standing on the word of God to to do this uh to support it. and um youth group uh Friday evening at 7:00 uh supposed to be at brother Sergey and sister Julia's but we'll just uh see uh if they're feeling up to that or not. If not we will move it to the church here. So uh we will give you an update and that reminds me sister Helen we should get your info to uh get you shared onto the church WhatsApp. Amen. so that you will be able to see or hear what is uh maybe happening birthdays and different things. Amen. Once again, is it good to be here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want to talk to you this morning on the bride's position part two. Uh I didn't I didn't change the title, but thank you so much. Love the song service this morning. Spoke to my heart. So, we're talking about the bride's position, but we're also, if it would be a secondary title, uh, the two natures. And, uh, so we'll look at this, the two natures within the bride. Amen. Because we'll we'll identify that as we go. But you see, everything that we're doing on the earth today has a counterpart. So, there's a bride here this morning, uh, worshiping the Lord, thankful to be in the house of God and give praise. But there's a counter type that is here that is uh in their own way worshiping, in their own way giving what they could give. And uh we certainly don't want to look down on them. What we should do is thank God that he has opened our eyes to see who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles this morning to the book of Esther, the first chapter. I want to read verses 9-2. Now, this might be a little bit direct, but my brother and sister, it doesn't get any more direct than this right here. Amen. It it really the Bible just lays it out so clearly before us that there are a people that will choose to sacrifice their life for Christ. &gt;&gt; And there is a people who will choose to sacrifice their life for Lucifer. &gt;&gt; And it's pretty straightforward. We don't like to hear that kind of thing. We'd like to think everyone would be saved, but that's not what this says. Amen. There's a decision to be made and there's a calling to be followed. And I thank God that we have been called. Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, Vashi the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahazarus. And on the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded, now I always mess these up, so you guys just pronounce them to yourself, okay? Uh, Meime, Bisna, Harbona, Bigtha, A, Abaga, Zether, Carcass, Carcass, the seven Chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahazerus the king to bring Vashi the queen before the king before the king with crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty. for she was fair to look on. But the queen Vashi refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains. Therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him. Heavenly Father, we ask you to just come this morning, Lord. Speak to us. Father, let this just rest in our soul. May we view this, Lord, that is being spoken this morning in the positive light. For Lord, we are not the ones that were called to refuse your calling, but we are the ones here that are able by the word of God, by your presence in our lives, we're able to respond to the call. And we are so thankful for that. We ask for your guiding hand this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated, saints. Maybe you could just say a little prayer for me. It just seemed like after we were on our way to church this morning, my throat started tickling and my nose started running. And I think the devil just just didn't want us to enjoy ourselves in the house of God today. Well, we're going to enjoy ourselves. Amen. So, as we look at this, I want to just bring to you the definition of a chamberlain to start off with so you can understand kind of the direction that I'm heading today. A chamberlain is an officer who manages the household of a monarch or noble. Amen. And this is my words. Maybe we could go as far as to say he's a minister or a pastor. Amen. So there it is. Because we are in the house of God. Amen. We are part of his house, part of his kingdom. And so we look at this and we'll say that today we're going to be looking at the story of two brides. Amen. And we can see how that this plays out. the very difference there is. And Vashi, she's taking uh uh uh what was given to her uh opportunity. She's having a feast for all the women in the royal house. And it's there that this comes. And I I don't know if you want to really go into typology here, but on the seventh day. Amen. It wasn't on the 5th or the 8th or the 9th, but on the seventh day. And I believe it's just fair to type this out to the church ages that in the seventh church age, amen, the heart of the king was Mary. Now the Lord Jesus Christ, our our heavenly father does not need wine to be happy. Amen. He does not need to to uh uh uh you know in bib as it would to to come to that place. But our God is actually a very happy God. Some people read the Bible and say I couldn't follow. I read this commentary. Amen. Says, "I just couldn't uh really follow Christianity because our God is angry all the time." Now, when I read my Bible, I am not reading a Bible that says, "My God is angry all the time." Amen. But I'm sitting here today knowing that when the Lord hears the praise of his saints and hears our prayers come as a sweet odor before him, he's not angry over that. He's actually blessed. Amen. He's saying, "This is my children and and they're they're speaking to me. They care about what I've said and and they're asking my advice. They want my counsel. I don't think that's an angry God. Amen. So, it's there that we see this feast had been made. And this story is now as I started and got distracted there, it's a story of two brides. Amen. We must remember that we'll see how it is that one while enjoying all the benefits of the kingdom. Amen. She decided she would do as she saw fit. And I'm I'm going to be blunt this morning. That's really where a lot of denominations have gone in the day that we live in. They are doing as they see fit. And I won't go into all the details lest we would become uh not so happy this morning. But I think you can sort that out for yourself that and see where the churches are diverging from the word of God. They they've accepted all kinds of ideas and all kinds of things. And you know there is um there is a a a an aspect of where today we have accepted into many churches the ideas of of different thoughts that were all through the ages. You remember that Nika was actually a a merging together of the ideas of what would make up Christianity. They say and maybe rightly so. They say Nika was the foundation of the Christian experience. But my brother and sister, it was Nika that the Lord Jesus come down and absolutely separated the true believer from the the uh the watered down and added to and taken away from uh word that they would call true Christian biblical standards. And so we we look at this and I I don't want to be too harsh this morning. Certainly as you study you you go into different paths. And my brother and sister, in the day that we're living in almost anything could be considered Christianity today. If you just believe that there is a God, you're a Christian. But my brother and sister, we're living in a day that there is a standard that God has given out of his word to a people. And that standard is causing these people to to rise up to the level God called them to, not the level the church called them to. So the word of God has come in this hour because we are in the seventh day and the king's heart is Mary. Amen. And he's calling forth a bride to come and he wanted to display her. Now it it seems, you know, to some they have ideas of exactly what it was. There's all kinds of myths and I don't encourage you to go look it up. But you know, I'll just show you how blunt or perverted the world can be. There are some that say, "Well, the king wanted Vashi. She was so beautiful to dance naked before the people." But I'm telling you, my brother and sister, that is not a type of the true bride of Christ. We're not going to be dancing naked before anyone. Now, I put that forth so you'll catch a little later, amen, in our thought that is there. But here it is. They call for Vashi, but she's in the midst of her own party. She's in a place, her own endeavor, you might say, and and uh she's she's doing what she was felt led to do. And she had all of the ladies together. Now, it was there in her endeavor. She is having this party. She is herself now representing herself as an authority, as someone that's a leader amongst the people, amongst the women. And we know that a woman represents the church. Amen. So she had her own ministry. She had her own following. And so it was there that she just didn't have time. She was busy. She saw herself as important. And it's there that she was focused on pleasing herself. Now, a little later, you'll be able to see where we tie this together. Amen. But she was focused on pleasing herself. This party was not as much for the guests as it was for Vashi. It elevated her and showed that she was in a position of authority that she had the ability to entertain or draw the people. Amen. So she was focused on pleasing herself and she actually saw no greater picture than herself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the Chamberlains come and said, "The king wants you." She said, "I have my own schedule. I have my own ideas. I have my own position. I'm in my position. I'm doing what I want to do. I I I'm fulfilling my agenda," you might say. And and so therefore, she said, "I I don't have a greater calling." In other words, when the king calls for me, that is not greater than my own calling. Amen. I want you to think about this, not as history, but of the day that we're living in. Amen. So we'll see that she was in a position of giving glory to herself. She was the main attraction of this banquet. And so we'll see today just for a moment the nature of the two brides. Amen. Now we know that all through the scripture there's twins, right? The there's always the good and the evil, the righteous and the unrighteous. We can go right on down the list. It's there that we'll see that that this position that she was in, she was expressing a nature. Now, that nature was not a nature, my brother and sister, that that would be such that it would be that the wife, the bride is a doormat to the king, absolutely not. We as Christians, my brother and sister, if the preaching of the word makes you feel like a doormat, either somebody's not preaching it to you correctly or you're not receiving it correctly. Amen. We are not doormats. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. And in the natural, any man who would not stand up and defend his bride is not a man at all. And our God, Amen, is here. He's righteous. He's holy. And he's here to defend his bride in this day. Amen. All you have to do is test him and ask and say, "Lord, I need you to come on this scene." And he will come on this scene, my brother and sister. Amen. When we are some midnight hours, the song says, "Amen. If you'll find you're in a prison in your mind and call out his name, he's right there waiting to hear you call and say, "I need your help. Come and speak to me. Come and deal with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't believe any one of us this morning can say that our God has failed to defend us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, one is given over to her own thoughts and her own values. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I think it would bear well not this morning to drag it out, but for us to take time to see what is it is our values. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or we could take it in a slightly different deal. What do we value? &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, the scripture says that a Christian is going to be washed in the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Do we value that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are are we willing to take what it t to do what it takes to be washed in the blood of the lamb? Amen. And as we're going to to communion tonight, Amen. We have to be washed in that blood, my brother and sister. We can't just come willy-nilly and and just say, "Well, God understands. I I have a temper and I I have this and I have that. God's not going to understand because he's given you a way to overcome that. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's given us a way of escape in the hour that we live in. Amen. And it doesn't matter what we're dealing with. Amen. But if you're given over to your own thoughts, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; We can explain almost anything away in our life. I was justified to behave the way I behaved. I was justified to say what I said. I was justified to do what I did. My brother and sister, we can justify anything. But what we want is the blood of Jesus Christ to come down, the Holy Spirit to come down on us and justify us. Not by our own means, not by your own ability, but by his word coming down, changing us and say, "It is my blood that makes it just as though you never did it in the first place." Amen. There is no self-righteous behavior, no ability of our own that can bring us to a place that we could say I am justified. It is only by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she had her own values and her own sense of importance. &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to sound contradictory but you should maintain your own self of position, your own sense of importance. You really should. &gt;&gt; And the reason I say that is not your opinion, not this and not that, but your importance. When you lose what you are in the kingdom of God, when you lose what you are in the economy of God, and you don't see yourself as important, you just see yourself as someone just wandering through life, just I'm of no importance. Nobody really cares about me. that is ripe for Satan to come and put something into your life that would be there seemingly important. But you need to know what your own importance is. And I'll put it this way just to keep this simple. I am a part of the bride of Jesus Christ. And you cannot take a rapture without me. &gt;&gt; That's not a boast, my brother and sister. That's a recognition of the importance that you have in the economy of God. to recognize that God did not come along and say, "Oh, they missed the bus. I don't care." He's here to say, "I never lost a one." You can't miss the bus. &gt;&gt; Amen. God might take you through hard trials. He might take you through things that you wished you didn't have to go through, but he will have you prepared to be able to take a rapture. Amen. We're not here not called of God, not desiring to serve God, not desiring to be found faithful to be tossed away at the end like a scrap. But you are important in the economy of God. &gt;&gt; But when we have our own sense of importance on the other side, but what I think is more important than what you think, what I think is more important than what the word says, &gt;&gt; I'm more important than the calling of God. my brother and sister, that's a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. She had this sense of importance and she had her own ideas what pleasure was. Now, if I could put it to you this way, I don't mean to be too awfully stark, but there'll be people today that will get drunk and they'll say, "It was fun. It was good. We had pleasure." And there's another people today that will come in the presence of almighty God, the Holy Spirit moving in their life today and say, "Oh, how pleasing, how pleasure it was to be in the presence of God today." So, we're seeing that is entirely different uh uh mode, you might say, of pleasure. how people would judge that. &gt;&gt; She was finding her own pleasure to be one that was subject to no higher calling. And in this place, we'll put it as a natural. It it folds over into the spiritual. But actually, in all reality, as we'll see the story unfold, there was no higher calling in her life than the call of her king. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, no higher calling. There should have been nothing that that uh rung more true to her than the king saying, "I want you to come and I I want to put you on display." Now, lest you would have an idea that that him putting her on display, you know, sounds awkward, uh, we'll we'll deal with that a little further by God's grace in the service. Amen. So, she had her sense of importance. She had her own idea what pleasure was. But what was happening the old time there with Vashi is she was actually sewing the seed of rebellion amongst all of these women. Now, these weren't just common from the street people. These were the leaders wives. These were important people in the kingdom, their wives. And she was actually sowing rebellion in the midst of those people. And my brother and sister, the scripture, uh, jump ahead a little bit, but my brother and sister, it says that that old harlot had daughters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when those daughters come, my brother and sister, they for a season had liberty from the spirit of rebellion that they come out of. But they never got fully shed of that. And that spirit came back and they have found themselves now once again being courted by the mother. Amen. And Na's daughters are being drawn back into it. There's some videos out there uh that we have come across, we have watched, looked at. My brother and sister, they even come to the words to say, "We're coming back to mama." Now my I'm telling you my brother and sister, we are not coming back to mama. Amen. We've got a heavenly father. Amen. A holy spirit that come down. We don't need a substitute in our life. We've got the original. We've got the life. We've got the nature. We've got the spirit. Amen. We've got what God wants us to have. We don't have to go back to a mother church to find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you've lost your way and you don't know who you are and you don't know your importance, you might well go right back to mother because at least there's a stability. Mother's been around a long time. Mother's was uh you know went through a lot of storms and she's still here and she's still stable and after all that's where we all come from. Isn't that a tricky lie of the devil? That's where we all come from. My brother and sister, I never came from there. You didn't come from there. We come straight from the throne of God. Amen. We bypassed our theophony and come right down on the earth to test and to share the gospel. Amen. Called to be witnesses of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now look, if you think I'm being harsh about that, all you do just go study some history of the churches and you'll find, my brother and sister, that when they went away, there was great liberty. Amen. Luther come and said, "The just shall live by faith." That was such a startling revelation in the hour it was. But my brother and sister, so many churches today don't even believe the just should live by faith. They want you to live by their creed, their dogma. They want you to live by their tradition, not by faith. Amen. Faith takes us out in the place that a denominational spirit can't walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I say denominal denominational spirit, I'm talking about man telling man how to serve God. It's not man telling man how to serve God. It's the Holy Spirit using man to tell us how to serve God. In other words, if &gt;&gt; Vashi had listened to the Chamberlains, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; she would have been able to say, "I've heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the Chamberlain, &gt;&gt; the voice of my king, &gt;&gt; my husband." &gt;&gt; Amen. The chamberlain was only carrying a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was not the authority. Otherwise, they would have made her gone. Now, if they were the authorities, trust me, when you have the bodyguard type, they would come out there and they would latch on to her and they would have drugged her, maybe kicking and screaming to the king. But they didn't have that authority. All they do is have authority to carry the message. And when the message is delivered, their responsibility is over. And it's up to the one who received the message or heard the message. Maybe they did not receive it, but they heard the message. Amen. and decided to reject it. Amen. So, you see what happens here is the council to the king. He comes along and and they're they're they're talking, you know, uh King Hazarus is is very upset. I mean, obviously his wife has snubbed him in public, right? &gt;&gt; And now, let's just take that in the natural. Amen. Probably every marriage has had a time where the husband or the wife gouged their spouse in public. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But because we're all in unity on that thought, does that make it right? &gt;&gt; No. And because somebody laughed, did that make it right? Because it made us feel good, &gt;&gt; did that make it right? Every one of these are systemic from this spirit that was on Vashi. That's right. It &gt;&gt; just shows you those spirits don't die. That's right. &gt;&gt; Those spirits are still on the earth today. Amen. So you look at this. So the council to the king, we'd have to believe that they were wise men. They had, you know, good, sound thoughts. And they told the king, you know, you really should do something about this. And unless it would spread through the whole church, I mean, the whole kingdom. Amen. you you you need to do something about this because if this is allowed to go on, well, the reason I'm giving you this advice, dear king, is my wife's sitting over there in that banquet, and if she catches that, I'm going to end up being snubbed and mocked just like you are, and I don't want that to happen. &gt;&gt; It's called influence. &gt;&gt; But I believe that they had more thought than that. They weren't just thinking about what their wife might act like when she come back from the banquet. But imagine a whole kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Imagine on the seventh day. &gt;&gt; What the kingdom would look like. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And their advice is is you're going to have to stop this this rebellion. You're going to have to do something about it. But a little bit contrary, my brother and sister, to what we're going to be speaking today is the parable of the wheat where Jesus told them, "Let the tear grow up with the wheat." That's why we see that those spirits are still here in the land today is because while Vashi was put out of being the queen, the spirit of rebellion was not done away with. &gt;&gt; Because God's plan actually needed that to come to, as you would say, be a separator, &gt;&gt; the sifting. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as it is, we'll see that they come, they give counsel to the king, and they're telling him unless this would would become an issue in the kingdom amongst all of the women in the kingdom, uh, you need to do something. And and what can we do? Do we publicly fogg a queen? Do we lock her, as it is in all the old medieval times, you know, the wicked witch, as it were, locked in the tower of the castle? No, she'd still scream her message &gt;&gt; from the open window. &gt;&gt; So, the only thing that the advice of his counselors were is you need to remove her from her position. &gt;&gt; And by removing her from her position, they will realize that this is not acceptable behavior. &gt;&gt; And so, we'll look and see. And there's so many types, so many avenues off of this today that there's no way I can do more than just touch the edge of them. But you see, he he took the counsel because he was worried about this spreading in his kingdom. And uh they remove Vashi from being queen. Now, my brother and sister, uh as simple as the scripture makes that look, it's a lot easier to put someone in a position than it is to take them out of the position. And so here is Vashy, the queen. It it was a shock to the kingdom that she was being removed from queen. After all, she was the most fashionable queen they had ever had, the most uh known, most recognized on the cover of more uh tabloids than any other. She was representative of the age and that spirit. And and you know, it's very strong those spirits, my brother and sister. We'll look at that and recognize that in the fashion world, I hope this isn't so in the church, unless we're talking positive. But in the fashion world, they come out here and if the the people wear less, then the world follows them and wears less. If they wear something that is shocking, then the world follows with something that is shocking. That's the nature of humanity. That's the nature of the spirit of the day that we live in. And it's there that we'll see this. That is in the nature of the church. &gt;&gt; And as the church would come and the farther it gets away from the word and the greater depth the spirit of rebellion comes into the church, it it will be there that my brother and sister, they don't see it as rebellion because everywhere they look, they're alike. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why you as Bible believing holinessminded Christians are going to be the oddballs are the oddballs of the age that we live in because they look around and they're all alike but you're different. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you must be the one with the problem because you're different and we're all the same. But you go back through your Bible, study your Bible, and you'll see that God has always had a called out people, a different people, a righteous people, a holy people. He didn't go out here and say, "I'm just going to convert the common man and let him stay as he was." But everywhere Jesus went, lives changed. Amen. The dead come to life. Amen. Leprosy went away. The blind could see. Those who could not hear could hear. Hearts were changed. My brother and sister. Amen. Where the gospel of Jesus Christ is preached, change happens. It is not just we want to change, but something inside of you almost causes you, forces you to change because you got to follow your heart and your heart's not in the fashion of religion. Oh, did you know that religion has a fashion? &gt;&gt; Amen. Religion has a fashion. And if you don't believe so, you just go study religion as a whole, my brother and sister, and you'll see that God will subtly break it all around the world, the big megaurch behaviors. Oh, this is blunt, and I'm sorry. I I wasn't really intending to say this, but we're already there. &gt;&gt; Almost every mega church on the earth today is rocked by scandal. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. financial scandal, sexual scandal, abuse of people, manipulation. &gt;&gt; And yet, not that long ago, they were glorified as, "Oh, this is what the church has come to." Well, I'll say that's what the church has come to because in the Bible, it was small. And I'm not saying you have to be a little church, but it was that mindset. that it was that approach spiritually, that little small close group that valued their relationship with Jesus Christ more than they valued their relationship on the evening news or out here to the neighborhood. Amen. Their relationship with Jesus Christ became predominant in their life and they followed that. &gt;&gt; But whenever the spirit of rebellion is there, they would come and say, "Leave us alone." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let us be as we desire to be. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the sons of God looked on the daughters of man and saw that they were beautiful. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Don't preach to us." &gt;&gt; Don't preach to us. She believes in God. &gt;&gt; Only to find out it was a different God. &gt;&gt; It was a God of fashion. &gt;&gt; Is a God of You can go right down the list. We won't go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, look at this. We come down to the end of her story. She's no longer a queen. Now, I'll just put this out here. Don't want it to be offensive to you, but I don't care what happens. You walk away from church today or whatever, and every one of you have your own story. Brother Paul was way over here out in the bushes. He was here. He was too harsh. He didn't go hard enough. He this and that. Everybody's got their own story, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And look what happened, my brother and sister. If you can imagine the vast she went on and anyone who would listen she told them the king was abusive. That's the reason I couldn't go to him is because he treated me. The idea that he wanted to show me off was repulsive. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll just share something to you. prophet of God said, "This bride of Jesus Christ is here in her glory for the world to see what Christ in the flesh looks like." &gt;&gt; What's God doing? He's showing you off as a Christian. &gt;&gt; He's showing you off for who you are and your relationship. He doesn't want us to blend in like a wallflower. He wants you to stand out that he can be able to point out in the world today. This is what my bride looks like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to understand and desire and long to be what he would want to show off in this world. &gt;&gt; Not that he would just pass us over looking for something else. But Lord, let my life be worthy of this gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Create in me &gt;&gt; a clean heart and then show that clean heart to the world, Lord, to show THAT A HEART CAN BE CLEAN IN THE DAY that we live in where filth abounds, there can be clean hearts. &gt;&gt; And the word said there will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look in the parallels here. Now, this is a word. So I can just read the word and you can draw your conclusion. Revelation 18 1-7. And after these things, I saw an another angel come down from heaven having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird &gt;&gt; for all the nations. My brother and sister, this is not talking about some little religious movement hid in some little corner of a jungle somewhere. This is something that affected the whole world. And if you'll just stop and read your Bible, you can figure out exactly who that is. Amen. And where they're at. Amen. And so they become a habitation, a hold of every foul spirit, cage of every unclean, hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we that people? &gt;&gt; We've been called out by the word of God. We're not here just to say, "Look, we can get along to go along." But my brother and sister, we are a called out people. &gt;&gt; That you be not partakers of her sins, that you receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached into the heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. reward her even as she rewarded you. And I'm just going to tell you a little something right now. Amen. Now, we've been blessed by God's grace to go preach in Paraguay to travel almost the length of the country. Beautiful time preaching going got to be a little bit of a tourist sightseer. And we come to these places that are out. They're abandoned. They're kind of like memorial park things now. And uh literally the plaques tell the story. And now, if they're willing to put it on a plaque, my brother and sister, you must think that they probably believe it, right? It wasn't somebody's whim that they just took a little tape and a paper and slapped it on something. But they took time to cast these. And it tells a story about how these great big buildings and things were built and and uh I hope you're not timid this morning, but the Catholic Church come in there. They literally enslaved the native people. Thousands upon tens of thousands of slaves were worked to death to build these giant these giant cathedrals, you might say, these giant places. And then history also shows us how that it come a time that Paraguay, the government, and the people of Paraguay said, "We've had enough. You take our gold, you take our beautiful young maidens, you take everything and and you work the rest of us to death. You don't care." and they drove the Catholic Church out of Paraguay. You think, "Oh, that's a good thing." But time went on. And from that moment in time, the role that Paraguay played in that region diminished. Brazil took some of their land. Oh, we say it's not spiritual. Come on, saints. I want you to think about the big picture. Brazil took some of their land and every bordering country, Amen. Every bordering country took some of their land. They are a fraction of what they used to be. &gt;&gt; And you know what? They even today in public places will tell you it was when we turned our back on the Catholic Church. They turned their force against us. And we have suffered and suffered and suffered every day since. There's power. &gt;&gt; There's power, my brother and sister. And almost as a treaty because the people were suffering under that influence so greatly, they actually allowed the Catholic Church back into their country. And there are many great scholars in Paraguay today will tell you. And that was our second mistake. But I'm telling you, there is the kind of power that is welded amongst them. How that they are able to come and change the course of nations. And let me tell you right now, just in case you all wonder, go study for yourself the makeup of the government of the United States today. &gt;&gt; Certainly, &gt;&gt; they're not just good Catholics. They're Jesuits. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the Jesuits have a value system that says that if you are not of them, you have no value. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm saying this out pretty blunt, but I just want you to understand, we're not talking about flesh and blood today. We're talking about spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that he's declared that she's fallen. And it says, "Come out of her, my people, that you're not partakers of her sins. Receive not of her plagues, for her sins have reached into heaven, and God had remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you double into her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled filled to her double how much she hath glorified herself lived deliciously &gt;&gt; so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart &gt;&gt; that's it &gt;&gt; take this back to Vashi &gt;&gt; I sit a queen and am no widow Even after Vashi was taken from the throne, she still claimed that she was the queen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And rightly so, but she needed to put it in past tense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, there's a day this is coming. It shall be &gt;&gt; past tense. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And spiritually, that day has already come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And shall see no sorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, you can go read your own Bible. You can even type into Google, what city sits on seven hills. &gt;&gt; And even Google can answer that question for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't want to go waste your time to type it in, I'll just give you the answer. It's called Rome. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sits on seven hills. &gt;&gt; The scripture has prophesied that it will fall. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So look at this now. being warned to come out. But see, she believed she was untouchable. I believe Ashy would not have uh acted or reacted like she did if she had believed that she was vulnerable in her position as the queen. But she felt like that she was untouchable and become aloof to the desires of the king. Now, my brother and sister, she was a bride that was produced by the spirit of the age. But there's another spirit in that age, and it wasn't in a far off land. It was just, you might say, down the street from Vashie's house. &gt;&gt; Just down the street. Am I Am I too direct this morning? &gt;&gt; So, there was a bride produced by the spirit of the age called Vashi, but there was a bride produced by the spirit of the age called Esther. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we see the contrast. It is. And it wasn't just for that day, but it's for the ages. Do you realize this is not just an example for that day, but it is the word. Amen. It is the spirit. It is the nature of the ages. Because the prophet of God told us those spirits don't die. Amen. They don't pass away. They don't come to end. They just move on. Amen. And they've come right down through the ages to today. And so, it's there uh that it is there. So Vashy no longer has a husband but claims to be a queen. And she comes right here and says, "I am no widow." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I still have a husband. &gt;&gt; But the husband doesn't claim her. &gt;&gt; So this is a one-sided love affair. Only this is not really love. &gt;&gt; This is position, power, authority. And that was the root of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The desire to control someone. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to really blunt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That spirit still lives in churches today. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Men that want to dominate. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be part of this, you will do this, this, and this. And for some reason, people forget to read their Bible or simply don't understand what they're reading. And they go for that. They fall for that. And they they do the most silly things. You would say, "Why would someone do that?" Just read the other day how this man, I won't name his name, h has just millions upon millions and preached a sermon in his church about if you want God to save your lost children, you'll take your savings and you'll give it to me. And this little lady went took every drop of savings she had in her life and she gave it to the preacher. The preacher got a new jet and her children never come to serve God. and she was broke. &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister, that is not the gospel. That is a seducing spirit that is causing people to think that if I do this, it's completely outside of the word of God. Now remember, come back to the story there. And Jesus said that little widow who gave her might gave more than the rich man. Amen. God's not looking at how much I I'm going to put myself in the poor house to support a man with millions and believe that's how God the reason God's going to uh uh answer my questions, answer my prayers. &gt;&gt; Come right, &gt;&gt; God will answer your prayers. when you submit to this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hopefully, you'll take this right. But if you ever have to fill out a financial statement to come to church, &gt;&gt; find a new church first. &gt;&gt; When they care more about your money, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; than they care about your soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Find another church. Right? &gt;&gt; Let money be the back burner. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes money. These lights, all these things in the modern day, it takes money. &gt;&gt; But don't let that be the priority. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac shares with us. I think he's even mentioned it here in the church. He's seen a video one time where his preachers preaching prosperity. And then he's there and you know that church was they were sewing. They were expecting to get a harvest. They were sewing. And the preacher starts going money, money, money, money. money starts falling out of the rafters. Now, don't expect that. If it was, it wouldn't be very much. You could pick up the change. But you see what it is. People fall for that. And what the preacher was doing is this money fell. He was coaching the people that as this money falls, you pick it up and then you bring it to the front and put it back into the &gt;&gt; I wonder if he got it all back. Are we okay? &gt;&gt; If she's queen, where is her king? &gt;&gt; That's right. There you are. Who is he? &gt;&gt; Because I believe every one of us today can identify who our king is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at Esther for just a few minutes. I need to hurry here. Amen. Esther responded to something greater than herself. Now in Esther the 4th chapter verses 12-1 17. And they told to Mordei Esther's words. Then Mori commanded to answer Esther, "Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" Please, every one of us, apply that to our life. We come to the kingdom for a time such as this. An evil age. Amen. A dark age. A deceptive age. And God said, "I've got some people that can overcome in this age. I've called them and they're coming." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then Esther bade them return. Mori this answer. Go gather therefore all of the church. &gt;&gt; Come on. Put it to our day, right? We're not viewing it as Jews and Gentiles. Gathered together all of the church, all of the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day, and I also in my maidens will fast likewise. Sure looks to me like maybe Esther had some converts. &gt;&gt; Maybe those who lived around her every day &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; said, "She is so different." &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's something different, Esther. What's different about you? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Oh, how many times we have been approached in our lives of people saying, "What's different about you?" &gt;&gt; Now, if we look like the world, smelled like the world, acted like the world, dressed like the world, they're not going to come and say, "Why are you so different?" They're going to be able to say, "Oh, you got your hairstyle from the cover of the same magazine I got my hairstyle from. I don't know if it's real or not, but maybe there's even a site called churchfashions.com. Now look at this. I think this is really special. This should be how we unabandonly throw ourselves into our life as Christians. Go gather together all the Jews that are present in Susan. Fast ye from me. Neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise. So will I go unto the king which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, here is clear foundation of the bride of Jesus Christ coming boldly to the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say, "I got limitations for you." What he wants is a people that are bold enough to take the law and say, "The law is not for me when it comes to approaching my Lord and Savior, my God, my king. It's not a me. The law is not going to stop me from approaching him." Amen. Look what the spirit was on Daniel. You know, we'll throw you in a lion's den if you don't stop this. He didn't go close the deal up uh so he could just peek out through the crack and pray anyhow. He left it wide open because he looked at their law and says, "If God takes my life, he takes my life. But I'm going to serve God with all my heart, mind, body, and soul. I'm not going TO BE HELD BACK by the spirit of this day, the spirit of politics, the spirit of our nation. I'd rather be gone than to be submitted to this." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother and sister, this is what the nature see that same spirit that was on Daniel, we see it right here uh on on Esther. We see it come right down and it's right here in the 21st century on the bride of Christ that says there's not one thing that's going to stop me from serving my God. Amen. Whether it be famine or pestilence or uh uh be torture, whatever it might be, nothing's going to stop me from serving my God. I was sorting through one of the zillion books I have in my little library and I come across and I'm right now absent of the the the title of that book, but it was about a young man in Russia at a time and they they told him, "You know what? If you'll just quit your whole religious thing here, we'll let you go." And he says, "Why don't you just go ahead and torture me?" And they said, "Well, we'll make you give this up." And in the end, who broke? &gt;&gt; It wasn't him. They broke this body. &gt;&gt; That's right. But they didn't break his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we put the wrong value, if we put our value on this body, we'll break. But when we put the value on our soul, you will not break because your soul does not belong to you. It belongs to Christ. &gt;&gt; And you can't give away something that's not yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So look, Mori goes verse 17, does what Esther commanded him. Now we go the next jump right over the chapter there. Chapter 5:es 1-3. Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to keep that royal apparel in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house. So we've really got a a royal flush here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Over against the gate of the house. And it was so. When the king saw the bride, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; Esther, &gt;&gt; his wife, &gt;&gt; right, he didn't see some woman standing there in royal apparel. He saw something that was intimate and special, something that had his heart, something that literally gripped his heart. &gt;&gt; Need some marriage counseling? It's right there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You need to be able to look at your wife or your husband. Amen. and be absolutely gripped by your love for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Standing in the court and she obtained favor in his sight. And the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is not original thought to me. This is something another brother was speaking and and it really rung with me, really held true. He said, "Our king is sitting today on his throne holding out his royal scepter." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a solid gold deal with jewels on the end of it. He's holding out the royal scepter of our age, and that is his word. Amen. The rubies and gold have no value compared to this word. That all passes away, BUT THIS CANNOT pass away. Amen. And he's holding his scepter out to you and I today if we would take a hold of that and receive it. And look at this. It wasn't just an acknowledgement. Oh, I see your scepter. She had to touch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She had to be part of it. And he looks at her and he is so moved by who she is. &gt;&gt; That's it. You will not find one word recorded in any kind of history that shows these kind of words were ever spoken to Vashi. &gt;&gt; But in this time right here, the king said the king unto her, "What will thou queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be given thee to the half of the kingdom." &gt;&gt; Oh my brother and sister, look at the difference. One is coming. She's got an issue. She's got something she needs. Amen. It wasn't a royal banquet and to impress all the other princesses and whatevers of the nations. My brother and sister, she's there because she's got a different kind of heart. She's not wanting to throw a party. She cares about souls. She's looking out there saying, "These are souls. These are my people and they have souls and Lord, you need to save them." And God comes and says, "I'm going to work, but I'm going to work it through a way that is not what you would think." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And she says, "Oh, um, look, this rotten Hmon, um, he's causing me problems. This guy right here standing off the side of your throne, he's causing me problems. Uh, if it would please you, &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; would please you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to throw a banquet at my house &gt;&gt; just for you." Yes. &gt;&gt; And for Hmon, &gt;&gt; and please catch this. I know it's real simple, but I'm a simple guy. &gt;&gt; Hmon, his online name was Lucifer. He was so pleased. &gt;&gt; Oh my, look at this. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be elevated even higher. No one's ever been invited to the queen's house but me. And I'm going with the king. Oh, how wonderful. They have a little banquet. King says, Esther, what is it you need? Um, can you come to my house tomorrow? You know what was happening? Esther wasn't scheming. Esther was praying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And she realized she hadn't prayed enough. I need another day to pray. Imagine how many hasty decisions. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Be bear with me, saints. How many hasty decisions we have made &gt;&gt; when we had another day to pray. &gt;&gt; We had time. &gt;&gt; We had ability. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we hastily made the decision. You know what? You guys are looking at me like I'm going to raise my hand just so you know that the guy who's preaching at you today has made a lot of hasty decisions. And I've paid some large, large prices for those hasty decisions. God help me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's forgiven me, but my brother and sister, my brain still remembers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, just like the Indian that was hunting with brother Brandham says, "You go too fast." Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon was a good hunter. Everybody that hunted with him, he had a whole list of people who were like he was exceptional hunter, had good ears, good eyes and here his Indian friend is saying, "No, no, you step once and then you keep looking around you before you take another step." &gt;&gt; What are we? Lord, I want to do this. Lord, I I think I I think Lord, I feel it. I feel that you're telling me to do this that afternoon. Let's do something that would be affliction for all of us. A brand new pickup. And I'll make a confession to you. I've been looking at pickups and they smell &gt;&gt; almost new. Yeah. And they look so nice. You're right, Brother David. It is almost new. It's a new pickup, but it's so close to new that you guys would say you bought a new pickup. My only question is is why does God get rid of a pickup that's so new? &gt;&gt; I mean, Brother Ivan will disagree with me on this, but they're good for 200, 300,000 miles. Why would you get rid of it with just a few miles? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; might be something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; Or it could just be a trap of the devil. But in our haste and Esther says, "You know what? It was a lovely meal. So glad to spend time with my husband." I won't tell you what brother said this. He says, "You know what, brothers? You should listen to this here." Not talking about Esther, but when your wife says, "I don't see you enough." You might ought to listen cuz she's either going to see you or she's going to the bon mare. So, one or the other. You or the shopping mall. Maybe you should spend more time with her. But Sister Jerry tells me, "Ha, that's why they invented Amazon. I can sit with you and still go shopping." Yeah. Boy, the devil's tricky. But then the next day, everything's just right because God's orchestrated the timing. And Esther finds the deliverance for people. Now, my brother and sister, we have a brother, sister, husband, wife, son or daughter not serving God. You just keep praying for them. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow might be the day of their deliverance. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen today, &gt;&gt; you pray it happens tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And you just keep praying like tomorrow is going to be the day and the day will come when it is the day &gt;&gt; and God will move in your midst and you will say, "Praise God, he answered my prayer." But you see, if you get impatient, &gt;&gt; you'll totally miss the will of God. Esther could have come barging to the throne, touched the scepter and said, "I'm here to deal with you, to talk to you, my husband, about that man Hmon, that evil man that you have in your kingdom with you. That man who's destructive. He's a liar, a cheat, and a thief. And you don't even recognize it." &gt;&gt; Wonder how that would have turned out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because remember, they warned Esther, you go there and he doesn't accept you, &gt;&gt; you're in trouble, &gt;&gt; right? But I don't know what happens if they're accepted and then they're belligerent. &gt;&gt; I won't say that out loud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at this real quick. See, the bride's calling is beyond herself. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's she's not there just thinking about herself. She's thinking about all of those around her. Amen. And what is she willing to do? She's willing to step into the battle. Now, you know what the you know what the the human nature is? We're going to step in and we're going to give all kinds of advice. But what prophet of God say? Pray. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You want to change somebody's mind. You look right here in this little assembly. You You think somebody's headed the wrong direction. You don't need to go give them a piece of your mind because you do that too often, you won't have any mind left. But you come there and come to the place that you don't agree with what they're doing. You pray for them. &gt;&gt; Get down. Not a Lord, help them, but get down and get serious and not more than one little moment, but let it be a day or two or many days or days of your week uh praying for them and it will change lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will save lives. Amen. And she she caught a revelation. You realize it's a revelation, saints, to come boldly to the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Many people have that very timid approach. God's such an awesome God, such a reverent God, such a holy God. I can't approach him. But the word of God tells you, am I telling you the truth? &gt;&gt; He tells you to come boldly to the throne of God. And that means whether you live or die, you're going to go to that throne and you're going to present your case to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, look at this. Don't misunderstand what I'm fixing to say here. To come to the throne is life. To come boldly as God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And a true wordfilled bride brings glory to her husband. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to look at this story of Esther. She didn't ever, not once in this whole story did she put her husband in a position that embarrassed him, shamed him, caused him to look bad in the eyes of the people. Everything she did, she let it just naturally unfold itself until when it come to the point, if you don't mind me playing this out, you want to see how God works and how supernatural God is, they're there. She's there. They're they're having that, you know, I don't know, like giant couch, whatever. and and they're there. And when the king is disturbed by what Esther shares, look what Hmon does. Trying to defend himself. Look how look how God moves. Hmon trying to defend himself gets up and he's telling Esther, "No, I would never." And he falls down right upon her feet and lower legs. And about that time, the king turns around and sealed Hmon's fate right there. He's in a turmoil. my faithful man, Hmon, and my wife's making an accusation and turns around and it looks as though Hmon is assaulting &gt;&gt; his wife. &gt;&gt; And it's settled. And I'm telling you, my brother and sister, Lucifer's fate was settled. Amen. when he, our king, our husband, looked down and saw Lucifer assaulting his bride, &gt;&gt; there would be no grace for Satan, even if he desired grace. &gt;&gt; Because God is not a God to let his wife, his bride, be assaulted &gt;&gt; and just look the other way. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, look what God's doing. This is why the bride of Christ is going to have, as it were, a final voice in a final age because God respects her judgment, respects her words. Amen. I need to be done. Amen. A true word-filled bride brings glory to her husband. I think we honestly could put that in in the natural and spiritual because you see natural spiritual we have no scripture instructing us to bring glory to ourselves. If there be any glory in us it has come from our husband our king. Now John 12:32 says and I if I be lifted up from the earth Jesus speaking will draw all men unto me. See he said if I be lifted up so there's where the gloryy's at. We're lifting him up. &gt;&gt; Now, let me hurry through this. 1 Corinthians 6:1 19-20. What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, which ye are not your own? Now, how can we bring glory to something that's not even ours? We bring it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. For you were bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it's a very clear picture of how we should bring glory and honor. We shouldn't be doing this. Oh, if I do this, somebody will notice my ability. My brother and sister, I I'll be kind of vague on this, but there was something that happened many years ago and a man, a brother, he told me, he says, "There's these certain meetings, and a lot of ministers of big churches are are there at those meetings." And I I was I was just blindsided by this. He said, "You know what? If you go to those meetings, you'll get invitations to preach at some of the biggest churches in America." Something inside of me says, "You will never go there." &gt;&gt; So that's not what we're here for. &gt;&gt; Not here to get invited in publicity, &gt;&gt; be put up in a position Right. &gt;&gt; And even if I was a really good preacher, you know, to go there and people say, "Oh, he's such a good preacher." My brother and sister, that's the wrong thing. I'll tell you how I am. &gt;&gt; I'm just a farm boy. I've got a pitchfork and I want to feed the sheep. I don't want to feed the sheep that are 20 miles down the road, 100 miles, 500, a thousand, 5,000. Yeah, we'll go. We'll preach. There's things. I'm not saying that. but but to use that as as the open door to to go and and leave the sheep at home. I was talking to a pastor here recently. And he was telling me, "How come you don't travel very much, Paul?" And I said, "Well, brother, not that we don't have good ministry, Brother David. Faithful ministry right here in our church, but I said, "It's the pastor's job to feed sheep. And imagine if you're gone all this lot, a lot a lot a lot. &gt;&gt; Just imagine it in the natural. Nobody fed your sheep while you were gone. &gt;&gt; Not only would a wolf come, but you'd have some really skinny sheep. &gt;&gt; It's not our job. Yeah. Okay. Sounds like a contradiction. I'm going to South America in a couple weeks. But there's young children there, teenagers. Amen. And we're believing God's going to move in their midst. We're going to believe God's going to touch them. But I'll be back and you'll be well fed while I'm gone. But look at this. Amen. Brother Alex, are you going to play for us or you still interpreting? Amen. Look at book of Romans 15 1-7. You know, uh you can take that as homework. uh and see how our Lord felt about us. Amen. That we can verse six that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father our lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive you one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God. See so we should we can't have clicks in the church saints. What we're doing is doing Satan's work when we divide the church up that we're this group, that group, this group, that group. No, we're one body here and we need to remain one body and not let Satan cause us to become a split body. Okay, I'm going to be done right here. Just a scripture and a quote. Amen. So, look at this here in Revelations 19 and6. Here's Esther. Here is Esther in the New Testament. You realize that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Here's Esther in the New Testament. And I heard as a voice great multitude and as a voice of many waters and voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; There's an Esther spirit come right down here in the New Testament. She put on her royal garment. She didn't put on the fashion of the age. You notice that about Esther. Imagine now, pardon me. I just have to finish this. When the king was looking for a wife, I don't know what scandalous looked like in their day, but I'm sure that there were a few of those candidates that come to see the king thought, "Woo, he won't be able to resist me." as it was in the 30s. I'll just flash a well-turned ankle and that will get his attention. No, it didn't get his attention. He said, "I had a beauty queen once. &gt;&gt; And she wasn't a faithful wife. &gt;&gt; I want a different kind of wife this time." Look, this all ties into the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want a wife that won't even entertain the voice of another. That's right. &gt;&gt; She's my wife. &gt;&gt; She only hears my voice. She only wants to please me. &gt;&gt; And then with all this church fashion comes Esther dressed as a queen &gt;&gt; should be dressed. and he would have looked at her and said, "This is a young woman who's already prepared for the job at hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The marriage of the lamb has come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, these are the true sayings of God. This is the word of God to the Esther of this day. She's going to come robed in righteousness. Not going to look like everybody else. She's not going to turn a well- turned ankle to get the attention. It's going to be her righteousness, her nature, who she is, her spirit. Because you see, now this would be a little bit out of turn maybe. Forgive me if it does seem like it is. This is the same wife that's going to stand up and say, "Come." &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, if God's calling a righteous and holy bride and an unrighteous and unholy bride are calling her, no, can't happen. This bride right here, the Esther of this age is going to clothe herself. No mascara, no whatever. I forget all those names. I never been quite into that. Haven't never wore any of it myself. So I never knew which was good and which wasn't. She Oh, Max. Max F. Yeah. Why couldn't I think of that? She doesn't need that. Remember we talked earlier about knowing who you are. She knows who she is. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. I don't have to take the world and make myself look like the world to catch my husband's attention. I come righteous. I come holy. I come before his throne, not cowering. Is it okay to, you know, sometimes I'm demonstrative, but but you know, imagine you're coming up. You got something on your heart. You're going to come to the throne here to the altar and you're like, I'm not worthy. I don't know if I should go. We do it in our own closet though. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. Come on. If you feel like you're not worthy, get in a position that you can say, "By your grace, I am worthy. I am worthy to come to this throne. I'm worthy to come in my husband's presence. I'm worthy to touch the end of the scepter, the word of God. I'm worthy to take him at his promise. I'm worthy to be called his wife &gt;&gt; because he said so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And these are the true sayings of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't put this so you won't see the quote here. It was something after I was in the back room. The conflict between God and Satan. Is that conflict still going on? The bride must be unified. Oh, it is there. Did you just find it? Did I put it on there? I'm losing my mind. Pray for me. The bride must be unified. Unified together by the word. My sheep hear my voice. And this is his voice on printed word. Right? &gt;&gt; Unified by the word, she makes herself ready. not with a regular creed. Like Esther, when Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king, she didn't adorn themselves with all the things. She adorned herself with a sweet, meek spirit. That's what the bride is adorning herself with, with all of the fruits of the spirit following it. What she got assembling together in the fellowship of the word. Amen. Let's just stand. Hallelujah. Thank you for being patient. Amen. Oh, here's the quote that I didn't put. Wow. One more. Okay. It's short. &gt;&gt; It's short. And the sign of this time, he said, "Now, that's a true servant of God. Always is obedient to his master." See, not to show off or say something to elate somebody else, but to be honest and true with him that sent him. That's a true servant of Christ. Hallelujah. 269. Hallelujah. I stand I stand in awe. Amen. Let's sing this together. Just give praise to the Lord this morning. You are beautiful beyond description, too marvelous for words, too wonderful for comprehension, like nothing ever seen or heard. Who can grasp your infinite wisdom? Who can fathom the depth of your love? You are beautiful beyond description. Majesty enthroned above and I stand in awe of you. Oh, I stand I stand in all of you. Holy God to whom all my praise is to I stand in awe of you. You are beautiful beyond description to marvelous for words. Too wonderful for comprehension like nothing ever seen or heard. Who can fathom the depth of your love? Who can fathom? &gt;&gt; You are beautiful beyond description. Majesty throne above and I stand. Oh, I stand in awe of you. I stand I stand in all of you. Holy God to whom all my praise is to. I stand in awe of you. Amen. Are we ready, able, willing to pledge allegiance this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. 7:05. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyant throne. They were told that he would spare their lives. &gt;&gt; The name of Christ, but one by one they chose to die the son. Oh, that's this little bride of this hour. I like a great angelic choir saints. I can almost hear. Voices ring. For I pledge alce to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb. Now the years have come and the years have gone, but the cross calls of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost. Embrace the cross. Oh, one by one. Just give our lives a boil to give us life. Failed us on good sound on that final day. I pledge alions to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb to the lamb of God who bore my pain who took my place who wore my shame I will see to honor his command. I pledge alance to the lamb. I pledge alent to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will see to all his command. I pledge alent to the lamb. Amen. Amen. I whatever reason song kept coming back to me. Yet not I but Christ in me. Amen. Amen. Let's just sing that. What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer. There is no more for heaven now to give. He is my joy, my righteousness and freom, steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace. To this I hope my hope is only Jesus. For my life is wholly bound to him. Oh how strange and divine I can sing. All is mine yet not I. God through Christ in me. A night is dark, but I am not forsaken. For by my side, a Savior He will stay. I labor on in weakness and rejoiceing. For in my need his power is displayed. To this I hold. My shepherd will defend me through the deepest valley. He will lead. Oh, the night has been one, and I shall overcome, yet not I, but through Christ in me. No fate I dread, I know I am forgi. The future's sure the price it has been paid. For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon and he was raised to overthrow the grave. To this I hope my sin has been defeated. Jesus now and never is my plea. All the chains are released. I can sing. I am free yet not I. But through Christ in me with every breath I long to follow Jesus for he has said that he will bring me home and day by day I know he will renew me till I stand with joy before the throne. To this I hope my hope is only Jesus. All the glory ever more to him. When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ in me. To this I hope. My hope is only Jesus. The glory ever more to him when the race is complete. Still my lips shall repeat yet not I, but through Christ in me. And the race is complete. Still my lips shall repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ in me. Yet not I, but through Christ in me. Yet not I, but through Christ in me. Amen. All the glory ever more to him. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As we get ready to brother Paul mentioned songs just been on my heart very much the last uh last couple weeks was um creating me a clean heart. I just wanted to share this with you real quick. The last two verses of Psalms 139 says, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts. And if there be any wicked, way in me, lead me in the way everlasting." I pray as we go today, search us, oh Lord. Lord, purify us. Create us in Create in us a clean heart. Hallelujah. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. passest me not away from my presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. And renew a right spirit within me. bring Cate in me a clean heart home. Oh God, renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Amen. Praise God. Pray that he go with you. be with you today and in the week to come. God bless you.
