[38:21] little Fellowship uh

[38:34] has asked for us to remember her fiance
[38:37] her and her
[38:39] fiance uh for all the paperwork for him
[38:42] to be able to come and we see what's
[38:44] happening in the political world and and
[38:47] it affects like this situation our
[38:50] sister Wanda's wanders fiance it
[38:54] possibly affect uh circumstances with
[38:56] brother pan and sister aona and so we
[39:00] know that our God can do anything so
[39:02] please just lift these up in these realm
[39:06] that we live in uh you know we are here
[39:10] and sometimes if we're not careful we
[39:12] feel like the world politics governments
[39:15] are controlling us but we serve a god
[39:19] who's controlling them and so we just
[39:22] commit these things to the hand of the
[39:24] Lord amen I don't know I'm sorry I
[39:26] didn't catch that but just remember um
[39:30] sister uh aona uh and the baby uh Lord
[39:35] just bless them sister Jerry and I will
[39:37] be leaving this Friday uh and Brother
[39:41] David will be taking the coming Sunday
[39:43] service and we get a privilege to go
[39:46] down and be with brother pant sister
[39:48] koncha for uh a couple short days but
[39:52] really looking forward to that um so we
[39:56] also
[39:58] uh want to um share with you that the
[40:03] church has um sent an offering brother
[40:09] Sergey has been the connections which he
[40:13] has been for brother Barry and that to a
[40:16] lot of that that's going on there and so
[40:20] we have sent an offering we not meaning
[40:22] to be vague but some of those details
[40:25] don't matter uh the car ke region a
[40:28] small Church there um they can't work
[40:31] you know you don't dare the brothers
[40:33] don't dare go out the door go to work um
[40:36] you know being forced into uh the
[40:39] military and and whatnot but we have
[40:42] sent a $2500 offering to be able to give
[40:46] support to those families there in that
[40:49] church um and um you know when you read
[40:53] the reports those of you who might
[40:55] receive those from Brother Barry uh you
[40:57] realize that winter time uh is always
[41:01] been difficult in those areas you know
[41:03] the environment the cold
[41:06] opportunities but when you have no
[41:08] opportunity to even work uh it just
[41:11] makes things even much more uh they they
[41:15] can't gather together for church but
[41:17] they're bold and when they had communion
[41:20] they still come out and so that means
[41:22] that puts Brothers on the streets uh in
[41:26] that kind of time but they they care
[41:28] about that they want to be part of that
[41:29] and take communion otherwise they
[41:32] typically meet uh I think uh Skype or
[41:35] something of that nature that they
[41:37] communicate by and so please remember uh
[41:40] brother eigor and the church there in
[41:43] the kke region uh brother Sergey
[41:47] reminded me that is very much the same
[41:49] region sister April went to uh when she
[41:53] went to the Ukraine and and so the front
[41:55] lines are right there their their Church
[41:59] uh was damaged in the shelling so that's
[42:01] how close uh that they live to that line
[42:05] uh that the artillery comes right to
[42:07] their neighborhood so please remember
[42:10] the Saints there in carke and um I'm
[42:14] happy to announce uh this morning that
[42:17] the grace banquet which is April 5th um
[42:22] we have a speaker and of course
[42:24] everything we do in life is Lord will
[42:28] but our brother rap cook is committed at
[42:31] this point to being our speaker and and
[42:34] we're very excited about that uh brother
[42:37] rap is a wonderful wonderful brother

[42:42] that will be a real blessing to our
[42:45] young people uh in the banquet and uh of
[42:48] course further details uh coming on that
[42:52] and we also have a speaker for the
[42:55] Family Camp and uh
[42:58] um I I at first thought it was a long
[43:01] shot but we asked our brother Barry
[43:03] coffee if he would come and be our
[43:06] speaker for Family Camp and uh I loved
[43:10] his his first response and that was
[43:14] that's something I can do so amen we
[43:18] we're just uh happy that he felt led and
[43:22] then we checked back with him after he
[43:23] had time of prayer and um so we're
[43:26] looking for forward to brother Barry and
[43:29] uh sister Becky coming and being with us

[43:41] to you got to appreciate that you know
[43:43] that that uh just uh ready to step in

[43:49] announcements I thank you musicians sure
[43:51] appreciate the dedication to
[43:55] this worship service let's just stand as
[43:58] we would um
[44:01] go into the word this
[44:05] morning my title this
[44:07] morning looking in the right
[44:12] direction it's interesting sometimes
[44:14] when you're just studying and you read a
[44:17] quote and it just speaks to you and
[44:20] you're like that's it there there's
[44:22] where we're at and uh so hopefully by
[44:25] God's grace will be a blessing to you
[44:27] today let's turn to Psalm 121 veres
[44:32] 1-8 and
[44:38] uh just take a little bit from this
[44:41] thought here in the
[44:53] word I don't know how many of you are
[44:55] familiar with our brother Jeremy shr
[44:57] but he sings sang at um sister Pit's
[45:02] funeral this song and it's always struck
[45:05] me uh these these words being drawn out
[45:08] and uh starting verse one I will lift up
[45:12] my eyes into the hills from whence
[45:15] cometh my help can we say Amen to that
[45:18] my Help Cometh From The Lord which made
[45:21] Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy
[45:24] foot to be moved he that keepeth thee
[45:27] will not Slumber behold he that keepeth
[45:30] Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep
[45:33] The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy
[45:36] shade upon thyine right hand the sun
[45:39] shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon
[45:42] by Night the Lord shall preserve thee
[45:44] from all evil can we say thank you Lord
[45:48] preserve us from all evil he shall
[45:52] preserve thy
[45:54] Soul Satan would like to convince you
[45:57] and I that we are at risk but right here
[46:00] hidden in the
[46:03] word says he's going to preserve us amen
[46:06] amen thank you Lord amen the Lord shall
[46:11] preserve thy going out and thy coming in
[46:13] from this time forth and even forever
[46:17] more now I want to make a comment of my
[46:21] words right there we have to understand
[46:24] my brother and sister that we can take
[46:26] an approach preach as though people are
[46:30] outside but job was in the Hedge
[46:33] protected of almighty God and for God to
[46:37] open the Hedge doesn't mean we're lost
[46:39] right it's God who's in control amen and
[46:43] we look at this scripture I should say
[46:45] maybe I look at this scripture and my
[46:48] brother and sister I look at this
[46:49] through eyes that say I know I'm
[46:52] predestinated I know I've been called I
[46:55] know that God has sealed me and I know
[46:57] that I'm going to finish this race see
[47:00] not sitting here with a doubt or a fear
[47:03] or some kind of question mark But to
[47:06] come with a certainty now some people
[47:09] would actually say Well if you get too
[47:11] confident something will go wrong how
[47:13] can you be too confident in God Amen
[47:17] just as the prophet of God you know was
[47:19] sharing uh the little story about the
[47:20] woman that says you boast too much on
[47:23] him
[47:27] pardon me for using this strong of words
[47:28] but that's almost like an
[47:30] oxymoron because there's no way we can
[47:33] boast too much on our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:38] and there's no way that we can speak
[47:40] with too much confidence of what God has
[47:44] called us to amen he's the one who
[47:46] called and he's made the way and he gave
[47:49] the Assurance why don't we just get bold
[47:53] amen the word says we come boldly Before
[47:55] the Throne this should be part of of our
[47:57] boldness to be able to rise up and say
[48:00] I'm going to finish the race I'm not
[48:02] going to crawl across the line into
[48:04] Glory I'm going to March triumphant amen
[48:07] amen into the presence of almighty God
[48:10] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this
[48:12] day for the opportunity to come together
[48:15] Lord to receive your blessings from the
[48:17] word Lord we just ask you help us father
[48:20] to speak it that it might have its full
[48:22] impact upon the people Lord as we look
[48:25] Beyond Humanity we look at beyond our
[48:27] knowledge our abilities we look Beyond
[48:30] everything and we look entirely to you
[48:33] today Lord knowing that you are our
[48:36] strength father and as these verses have
[48:39] declared lord it's in you that we find
[48:42] our security we thank you Lord and ask
[48:45] for your guiding hand in the name of
[48:47] Jesus Christ amen you may be
[48:51] seated in the world that we live in
[48:53] today it is certainly A Time For Us uh
[48:57] to be focused uh there are so many
[49:00] distractions in the world there are so
[49:03] many things going on and uh not even
[49:06] just looking at worldly pleasures and
[49:08] those kind of things but just you know
[49:10] the the politics of the world the
[49:12] economies you know it's interesting uh
[49:16] how how these anointings are in this end
[49:19] time now I will throw something slightly
[49:21] political in if you don't mind for one
[49:24] moment just to make a point and that is
[49:26] you look look at like the man who got
[49:28] reelected and they say the vote was so
[49:31] ballots were burnt and things St but Mr
[49:34] Maduro in Venezuela has now been elected
[49:37] to his third term and he's got in there
[49:40] and now he's declaring you know we're
[49:42] going to invade these countries we're
[49:44] going to do this we're going to do that
[49:46] maybe we'll just go take Panama you know
[49:48] all of this kind of stuff and and the
[49:50] reason I bring that up is to reinforce
[49:53] the fact that the word says that there
[49:55] would be Wars and they are taking place
[49:57] and rumors of wars and and if we are
[50:00] caught up in that and we're looking to
[50:02] those things uh we'll be very much
[50:05] distracted uh just visiting with someone
[50:07] here the other day uh you know and they
[50:10] were like do you think this will lead to
[50:12] a nuclear confrontation and I I didn't I
[50:15] I knew they wouldn't handle it in the
[50:17] sense of of what we know you know I
[50:20] don't think that you can take someone
[50:21] with a question mark like that and say
[50:23] well there was a prophet of God who had
[50:25] a vision and saw America as a smoldering
[50:29] Wasteland it it it won't be beneficial
[50:32] to them but you see the point being this
[50:35] is on the minds of the people there
[50:37] there uh no rest no peace they're
[50:39] worried about what tomorrow will be and
[50:42] you know the bride of Christ we we
[50:44] should find ourselves uh uh staying away
[50:47] from those distractions we we shouldn't
[50:50] find ourselves looking at that and
[50:52] caught up in the emotion of the
[50:54] condition of the world Amen and and so
[50:57] you know uh it is all kinds of little
[51:00] distraction i' like to share something
[51:01] personal with you you know the last time
[51:04] that we had such tariffs in the nation
[51:06] my brother and sister it affected sister
[51:08] Jerry and I uh and our little uh economy
[51:11] on the farm uh severely uh you know so
[51:15] if I look at that and I say Well they're
[51:17] putting tariffs in and this is going to
[51:20] just tear up my world my brother and
[51:22] sister I wasn't counting on a president
[51:24] and his politics I was counting on the
[51:27] Lord Jesus Christ and he said he's never
[51:29] seen his children begging bread so I'm
[51:32] going to stand on that word I don't know
[51:34] what it will look like I don't know how
[51:36] it will come to pass but I got a choice
[51:38] to look at the world or I got a choice
[51:40] to look at the word and so we choose to
[51:43] look at the word because God said he
[51:45] ordered or ordained our footsteps and so
[51:49] we can't go out here and say I'm afraid
[51:51] where I'm going my brother and sister if
[51:53] we are in the will of God our footsteps
[51:56] are
[51:57] ordained amen and so sometimes even in
[52:00] our own
[52:02] foolishness God still got his hand all
[52:04] over us right you know it's there uh
[52:10] yeah talking to an individual here
[52:12] recently bought a brand new pickup he
[52:14] only has a
[52:15] $759 a month pickup payment now I'm
[52:19] telling you my brother and sister that's
[52:20] so staggering to me I can't comprehend
[52:22] it but it in that his life it was one of
[52:25] the most foolish things things I've ever
[52:27] done in my life and I thought you know
[52:29] if buying a pickup is as deep as your
[52:31] foolishness goes you'll be okay amen but
[52:35] you see there's all this distraction of
[52:37] the wants and the desire and all of this
[52:40] that's here in the world today and so
[52:43] these Wars rumors of wars all projected
[52:47] out of the word to you and I we look at
[52:49] politics my brother and sister politics
[52:52] you you can't really honestly find a
[52:55] Christian politician it's it's just you
[52:57] know it's just a a hard thing cuz after
[53:00] a while the corruption is so strong the
[53:03] influence is so strong they just don't
[53:05] last very long but you know there's
[53:08] another kind of politics in the world
[53:10] today that is more detrimental I believe
[53:12] and that is when the word of God gets
[53:15] thrown into a political Arena and you
[53:18] know we can get together and we can
[53:20] spend all kinds of time we can put all
[53:22] kinds of energies trying to explain what
[53:25] God meant
[53:27] trying to explain God we when people get
[53:30] all consumed in that and you know we
[53:32] need to know the Greek and the Latin and
[53:34] we need to know this that and the other
[53:36] so that we would be able to understand
[53:39] what the Lord meant but my brother and
[53:41] sister the same thing comes right down
[53:42] in the message there are people that are
[53:45] trying to explain what brother brandham
[53:48] meant well the prophet didn't say go out
[53:50] here and figure out what I meant he said
[53:52] pray for Revelation and when we pray for
[53:55] revelation will will understand what he
[53:58] said amen but look how there can be such
[54:01] distractions to that and so you know to
[54:05] understand and study the word is not
[54:06] what I'm saying my brother and sister
[54:08] it's when we try to interpret it the
[54:10] prophet of God said God is his own
[54:13] interpreter and I like God's
[54:16] interpretation even when it hurts amen
[54:19] amen right so you look at this when the
[54:23] prophet said pray for Revelation yes sir
[54:27] how would we pray for
[54:30] Revelation Lord give me more Revelation
[54:32] I want to have more Revelation I need
[54:34] more Revelation I need to no actually
[54:37] the foundation of that prayer would be
[54:39] Lord I Want To Know Your Perfect
[54:45] will he's already said when this time
[54:48] comes the mystery would be revealed so
[54:51] you know as a Believer as a daughter son
[54:53] of God that God's already Desiring to
[54:56] reveal himself to you this is not like a
[55:01] a mystery you know over in is Israel I
[55:03] just read Wars going on or was and all
[55:06] of those things are happening and
[55:07] there's still archaeologists out there
[55:10] just digging up because they're not
[55:11] concerned about all that that's another
[55:13] realm uh we're here and we're going to
[55:16] prove that that God was here prove that
[55:18] we as a nation were here and proving
[55:21] these things must come to pass and so
[55:24] these guys are and they're digging up
[55:26] little artifacts my brother and sister
[55:28] now I say this with a little humor I
[55:30] don't mean any any undercut to this but
[55:33] I've seen what I thought was a funny
[55:35] little deal the other day and it and it
[55:37] said a picture of a Palestinian Museum
[55:41] in
[55:42] Israel and it was an empty
[55:46] room now my brother and sister you see
[55:49] God is the prophet said that that God
[55:52] would prove his
[55:53] word amen now if he has use science
[55:57] which Archaeology is kind of a form of
[55:59] science if he uses however it is God's
[56:01] proving his word and there they're
[56:03] showing that that these things are real
[56:06] these things were here and it's
[56:07] reinforcing amongst the people in the
[56:09] world not just Israelis that that this
[56:12] is truly their land it's marked from
[56:14] north to south east to west even though
[56:17] when you look at a map and see what was
[56:19] promised to Israel and what they
[56:21] occupied is so small compared to what
[56:24] God promised to them but still in that
[56:27] land god is proving that these are my
[56:29] people I promis the land to them they
[56:32] have occupied it and they will occupy it
[56:35] again amen so we're looking now a lot of
[56:39] this going back to my title is we need
[56:42] to look in the right direction we can
[56:43] sit out here and say God is proving that
[56:46] Israel has occupied that land god is
[56:48] proving this as God is proving that but
[56:51] I want to ask you this morning while
[56:53] they're proving this what are you
[56:55] getting out of that exactly right you
[56:58] can sit here and read all kinds of books
[57:00] and magazines and articles and see all
[57:02] kinds of National Geographic type films
[57:06] documenting this but what are you
[57:07] getting out of it right amen a
[57:13] knowledge or
[57:15] Revelation that's right you see this is
[57:17] all Christ proving himself but for us as
[57:21] Gentiles we don't need to go back to
[57:23] find tablets and writings in a cave to
[57:26] know God is real we don't need to find
[57:29] plates and rings and gold coins and all
[57:32] of these things to prove that Israel
[57:34] occupied that land therefore the word of
[57:36] God is true amen God's brought it down
[57:39] to you and I to look at it in a personal
[57:42] realm now we can choose to look in that
[57:44] direction and say we have proof my
[57:47] brother and sister but I want to look in
[57:49] this direction and have proof amen I
[57:52] want to look in the word that God
[57:54] promised that I'll be with you even in
[57:56] you amen that I was in you before the
[57:58] foundation of the world and all of these
[58:01] scriptures that are pertain to that that
[58:04] God is proving he's with you and I I
[58:07] don't have to go as it were to a cave I
[58:11] remember a brother one time now don't
[58:12] misunderstand me on this but a brother
[58:14] one time says I so much want to go see
[58:17] the cave there at Green Mill and he says
[58:20] whatat about what do you think about
[58:22] this and I said I can do without it just
[58:24] fine thank You'
[58:26] and he was shocked he looked at me goes
[58:27] what do you mean you wouldn't want to go
[58:28] there I said no I believed the prophet
[58:31] that's right right I don't have to go
[58:33] there to see if it's real I believe what
[58:37] he said and so as we look here today and
[58:40] realize what God has said is right here
[58:43] to you and I we don't have to have
[58:45] something external or something that we
[58:48] can wow over because God said it and we
[58:51] believe it and therefore it will come to
[58:53] pass because that is God amen so you
[58:58] know when I say this uh uh be careful
[59:01] about being caught spending too much
[59:02] time trying to figure out what the Lord
[59:04] meant you have to understand that that
[59:06] is how you look at it it is intellectual
[59:10] or you can look at it and say when God
[59:12] wants me to see it I will see it amen
[59:16] there's Revelation coming to pass in our
[59:18] lives amen because we can dig into
[59:21] things and get out of season yes sir
[59:25] just as simple term that has been used
[59:27] for centuries we can get the cart before
[59:31] the horse am amen so when God reveals it
[59:34] we can dig in so deep I I think uh we
[59:38] could use the Seven Seals as an example
[59:41] amen people some dig so deep trying to
[59:44] prove that it's not and some dig so deep
[59:48] to prove that it is but I want to put it
[59:51] back to you in Simplicity this morning
[59:54] yes I study it I do my best to cross
[59:57] reference and put everything in its
[59:58] proper place but you see it's my not my
[1:00:01] job to make it real that's right it's my
[1:00:05] job whether I understand it completely
[1:00:08] or not to believe it the prophet never
[1:00:11] never said what you feel he said what
[1:00:13] you believe and so as we get into that
[1:00:16] realm now I'm not against don't
[1:00:18] misunderstand me I'm not against
[1:00:19] studying the word which some might say
[1:00:21] is intellectual but my brother and
[1:00:23] sister I I'm not opposed to that at all
[1:00:25] right that's how you teach a child right
[1:00:28] 2 plus 2 is four you're on the very
[1:00:30] threshold of
[1:00:32] intellectualism knowledge
[1:00:35] retained but you see when we come to the
[1:00:37] place that it's no longer our ability to
[1:00:40] explain we step out and say the
[1:00:43] scripture says that this mystery would
[1:00:46] be finished and it's finished yes sir
[1:00:49] can you explain it explain it to me I
[1:00:51] want you to explain it I don't need to
[1:00:54] explain it ask God to explain it to you
[1:00:57] which means you go pray for Revelation
[1:01:00] that's
[1:01:00] right but if they don't get Revelation
[1:01:03] they want natural explanation exactly
[1:01:06] right amen so as we look at this now my
[1:01:11] brother and sister the same thing
[1:01:13] happens when people start to study the
[1:01:15] message yes sir they're trying to
[1:01:18] understand the thought behind what
[1:01:19] brother Brandon was saying brother Bram
[1:01:21] said read between the lines so they're
[1:01:23] they're believing there's a mystery
[1:01:25] between the lines and I want to ask you
[1:01:27] this morning how many of you believe
[1:01:28] there's a mystery between the lines amen
[1:01:31] I would hope that every hand went up but
[1:01:33] you see they're approaching the mystery
[1:01:35] from a carnal intellectual approach that
[1:01:38] there's going to be some wow pop out but
[1:01:41] the believer when the wow comes out it's
[1:01:44] actually something in the soul that says
[1:01:47] Thank You Lord oh I love you more than
[1:01:50] ever Lord I need you more than ever Lord
[1:01:53] and someone says that's not a mystery
[1:01:56] amen and leod
[1:01:59] deia woed to sleep
[1:02:02] lukewarm distracted generation I say
[1:02:06] that's a revelation of a mystery that
[1:02:09] something inside you and I continue to
[1:02:11] just press forward in the word amen the
[1:02:14] storm Rises against you the world is
[1:02:16] against you a lot of things against you
[1:02:19] and there's something in you as you have
[1:02:21] ever been I've never been on on an ocean
[1:02:24] and had this happen but I I've been on a
[1:02:26] a lake in a boat before in a terrible
[1:02:29] storm many years ago in North Dakota and
[1:02:31] when the water is 3 feet deep when it
[1:02:33] comes over the front of your boat you
[1:02:35] start to get concerned that's right
[1:02:39] amen if I could share the humor of that
[1:02:42] there was a man fishing with us he had
[1:02:44] backslid hadn't served God for 3 four
[1:02:48] years he's out there in the boat with us
[1:02:50] and out of out of the well it would be
[1:02:52] the north I guess the wind all of a
[1:02:54] sudden picked up and it went from Dead
[1:02:57] Calm to this just horrible storm in
[1:02:59] about 2 minutes and as the water's
[1:03:02] coming over the front of the boat the
[1:03:04] back of the boat the side of the boat
[1:03:06] and and we're there and we are down
[1:03:08] there the Bild pump is running we've got
[1:03:10] a two or three bait buckets and we're we
[1:03:12] threw the bait right out it didn't
[1:03:13] matter anymore and we're we're bailing
[1:03:15] water and and you know it's pretty funny
[1:03:18] but it's not because God knows what it
[1:03:20] takes to get you and I in the position
[1:03:23] that we can see the word from the right
[1:03:25] perspective right it's not just about
[1:03:28] believing God sent a prophet my brother
[1:03:30] and sister the devil believes that God
[1:03:33] wants us to look through that and see
[1:03:36] the word revealed God used a man to say
[1:03:39] here I'm opening the book for you amen
[1:03:43] and when the book was open we need to
[1:03:45] eat that book but this brother been
[1:03:48] backslid you know God was doing
[1:03:50] something his heart cuz he come and went
[1:03:52] fishing with a whole bunch of brothers
[1:03:54] and so here he is the only unbel lever
[1:03:56] amongst us and he was in the boat with
[1:03:58] us that day and Water started coming
[1:04:00] over the nose and I remember I was there
[1:04:02] with a bucket in the back of the boat
[1:04:04] throwing water out as fast as I could
[1:04:06] and still trying to steer the boat and I
[1:04:08] look up and at first now this shows us
[1:04:10] our carnal human nature I look up at him
[1:04:12] and I said what is that guy doing why
[1:04:14] isn't he bailing water and I realized he
[1:04:16] was in the front of the
[1:04:20] boat excuse me praying through that's it
[1:04:25] yeah God forgive me that's right God
[1:04:29] forgive me he wasn't saying save my life
[1:04:32] he was saying Lord save my soul right I
[1:04:36] would have never thought that a fishing
[1:04:37] trip could turn into a
[1:04:39] Revival Lord but it did amen you know my
[1:04:43] brother and sister I I remember you know
[1:04:46] that that man before we left finished
[1:04:49] that fishing trip was a changed man you
[1:04:51] knew something had happened am my so
[1:04:57] we're not here to to try to figure out
[1:05:00] just exactly what brother brandham meant
[1:05:03] cuz now hang on to your hats coats
[1:05:07] whatever brother brandham contradicted
[1:05:13] himself am I telling the
[1:05:19] truth so
[1:05:21] therefore we can't trust this
[1:05:26] but do you know the only people who look
[1:05:28] through the message that brother Bram
[1:05:31] contradicted
[1:05:32] himself are the people who are looking
[1:05:35] in the wrong direction that's right when
[1:05:39] we start to look in the correct or right
[1:05:42] direction we see a man called of
[1:05:46] God and we see God that's right amen
[1:05:50] that's right you can't interchange those
[1:05:55] except for for when you can interchange
[1:05:58] them how's that for double
[1:06:00] talk what did Jesus say does not the
[1:06:04] word say that's right ye are
[1:06:09] Gods see how God is so so oh H how
[1:06:14] what's the word to use
[1:06:16] incredible that he takes the word and if
[1:06:19] you look at it wrong you come up with an
[1:06:22] absolutely wrong conclusion but when you
[1:06:25] look at it
[1:06:27] correctly you come up with Revelation
[1:06:30] amen God knows what he's doing and he's
[1:06:32] doing that so here's the prophet now let
[1:06:34] me put this out to you just as a mild
[1:06:36] example the prophet of God is saying now
[1:06:39] read between the lines so many men read
[1:06:42] between the lines and they came up with
[1:06:44] the Thunders
[1:06:45] right are the Thunders true yes sir they
[1:06:49] are absolutely 100% true if you look at
[1:06:54] them correctly amen hallelujah amen
[1:06:59] there's all kinds of examples we won't
[1:07:01] spend the time amen it all depends on
[1:07:04] how you are looking at this now let me
[1:07:06] throw one in for you amen you've had a
[1:07:09] bad day and the day is not getting any
[1:07:12] better and you look in the mirror and
[1:07:14] you see some person that's not even
[1:07:16] worthy to be called a son or daughter of
[1:07:18] God you see somebody that's a failure
[1:07:20] you see somebody that's too weak to go
[1:07:22] on I'm just going to quit now I want to
[1:07:24] ask you what way are you looking at that
[1:07:26] that's it amen when you look at it
[1:07:28] through the word you are looking at a
[1:07:31] battle uh scarred amen soldier of God
[1:07:36] that is there and God standing back
[1:07:38] saying Satan go
[1:07:41] ahead only thing you can do is take
[1:07:43] their
[1:07:44] life now look what we're
[1:07:47] doing I'm just going to quit I I I can't
[1:07:49] live this I can't I can't seem to do
[1:07:51] this and God sitting back yeah that's my
[1:07:54] daughter uh
[1:07:56] that's my son amen look at them
[1:07:59] victorious in every
[1:08:01] battle that's right and if we heard God
[1:08:04] say that we'd be going who whoa
[1:08:07] mistake but our God makes no mistakes
[1:08:09] can you say that with me our God makes
[1:08:12] no mistakes amen and he says you're
[1:08:15] Victorious he says you are righteous he
[1:08:17] says You Are Holy amen he's got a whole
[1:08:20] vocabulary of what he says you are and
[1:08:22] it all matters how you and I look at it
[1:08:26] that's right amen because if you are
[1:08:31] defeated and you say you're
[1:08:34] defeated I have to be
[1:08:37] defeated then you are
[1:08:40] defeated if I lost a battle or at least
[1:08:43] I don't feel victorious in the battle
[1:08:45] but God says I'm Victorious God says I'm
[1:08:48] righteous God says I'm holy God says I'm
[1:08:51] called predestinated amen says I'm his
[1:08:54] son amen a daughter whatever it all
[1:08:57] depends on how you look at it right and
[1:08:59] as we look at it wrong my brother and
[1:09:01] sister you're going to have a hard time
[1:09:02] getting a good conclusion but if you
[1:09:05] look back to that day that God dealt
[1:09:07] with your heart amen he come down
[1:09:09] anointed you with the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:11] says I sealed you amen trust God when he
[1:09:14] says I sealed you amen he wasn't looking
[1:09:17] at your flesh he don't care about your
[1:09:18] flesh amen because he knows the word is
[1:09:21] going to overcome our flesh exactly oh
[1:09:24] Hallelujah
[1:09:26] amen so you know there's people I don't
[1:09:28] want to Bel labor this but people are
[1:09:29] saying okay you know we're we're
[1:09:31] studying this and this is exactly what
[1:09:33] the prophet meant my brother and sister
[1:09:35] please just be real careful when you do
[1:09:37] that make sure that you can tie this all
[1:09:40] together because one line ties to a line
[1:09:43] which ties to another line and makes the
[1:09:46] full picture amen but the world today uh
[1:09:49] the intellectualism the phds of the
[1:09:52] Gospel you know they want to explain go
[1:09:55] my brother and sister I'd like them to
[1:09:57] just start with a blade of grass
[1:10:02] yeah why don't we spend our time
[1:10:05] wisely and just take the Simplicity of
[1:10:08] what the prophet said and just pray for
[1:10:11] Revelation that's right Lord let me just
[1:10:14] see that's right your word the way you
[1:10:18] wanted me or you intended for it to be
[1:10:20] seen amen it'd go a lot further that's
[1:10:24] right amen
[1:10:26] Psalms 119 verse
[1:10:30] 133 now I like this here is here is
[1:10:34] David you know David incredible lived on
[1:10:37] the mountain top he lived in the valley
[1:10:38] and I think he might even have crawled
[1:10:40] in the ditch a time or two you know it
[1:10:44] just it just a you know you look at that
[1:10:46] and sometimes we think our life is tough
[1:10:48] here's
[1:10:50] David are you ready for
[1:10:52] this a man after God's own heart in a
[1:11:00] ditch amen okay let's quit whining and
[1:11:02] crying about our circumstances of Life
[1:11:05] hallelujah amen because here's
[1:11:08] David literally defined as a man after
[1:11:12] God's Own
[1:11:14] Heart order my steps in thy
[1:11:18] word now I'm going to use this a little
[1:11:21] Prejudice I hope you all don't mind but
[1:11:24] you see if we wish to put this prayer
[1:11:26] order my steps in thy word then we would
[1:11:29] be counting on God for opening and
[1:11:32] showing and leading Us by his word
[1:11:35] that's right it wouldn't be us as it
[1:11:39] were blundering that's
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:46] that's I think this has to be tied with
[1:11:48] that and this means
[1:11:50] this well if that can't come back and
[1:11:54] tie all the way back
[1:11:57] here we're on a goose chase and that
[1:12:00] goose chase sooner or later becomes a
[1:12:04] disaster and let not any iniquity have
[1:12:07] dominion over me amen now my brother and
[1:12:11] sister what why would ordering your
[1:12:13] steps in iniquity be tied
[1:12:18] together because God would lead the True
[1:12:21] Believer he'll lead you no further
[1:12:25] than where you can
[1:12:29] live this happened in another country
[1:12:31] happened to know man very well started
[1:12:33] off normal got very intellectual started
[1:12:36] digging into all this stuff and and
[1:12:38] pretty soon he he just got on Shaky
[1:12:40] Ground And um there in meetings
[1:12:44] literally his wife come and said please
[1:12:45] pray for my husband uh he's now
[1:12:48] explained away the
[1:12:52] message and you're like how did do that
[1:12:56] well he's got piles and piles of books
[1:12:58] that are piles and piles of dictionaries
[1:13:00] and references to this and to that and
[1:13:02] he's got them all tied together and got
[1:13:04] great writings got all this stuff and
[1:13:07] now he believes we don't need the
[1:13:09] message and I remember at the time I was
[1:13:12] like yeah that brother's pretty smart I
[1:13:15] don't know how I would be able to deal
[1:13:17] with him but I didn't need to deal with
[1:13:19] him that's right God said I'll deal with
[1:13:23] him see there's the problem we get as
[1:13:25] preacher sometimes we're going to deal
[1:13:27] with the problem I can fix this amen but
[1:13:30] we're not called to fix it that's right
[1:13:32] God said I'll fix iten amen we're called
[1:13:34] to pray we're called to ask God to just
[1:13:36] give us wisdom in our portion of it and
[1:13:39] just leave the rest in God's hands and
[1:13:41] and in this case that brother one day
[1:13:43] just comes back I wasn't there at that
[1:13:44] time but he he just comes back and goes
[1:13:47] you know I I got the wrong definition of
[1:13:50] this one word way back here and it just
[1:13:53] led me off on this goose chase and
[1:13:55] realize once I figured out I had the
[1:13:56] wrong
[1:13:57] definition that all of this was just
[1:14:01] nothing and in one day just as in one
[1:14:04] day left one day he's back gets up
[1:14:08] church I'm sorry for all those foolish
[1:14:10] statements I made Lord help me you see
[1:14:14] God is going to order your steps in the
[1:14:18] word amen that's right that's right and
[1:14:21] that's also keeps us from going out here
[1:14:24] and putting our own in interpretation to
[1:14:26] it amen so let not any iniquity amen
[1:14:30] knowing what we should do and not doing
[1:14:31] it don't let any iniquity have dominion
[1:14:34] over us and part of that would be my
[1:14:36] brother and sister simply you know I'll
[1:14:38] take a simple example the word says uh
[1:14:41] uh uh you know repent and be baptized
[1:14:44] can we make that
[1:14:46] complicated you wouldn't think so would
[1:14:48] you but they have they've made that very
[1:14:53] complicated now the word
[1:14:56] order literally means arrange my steps
[1:15:01] amen by command
[1:15:05] amen my you know what that
[1:15:07] means we can just walk amen come on
[1:15:11] let's not get too spiritual today or
[1:15:14] maybe we should be more spiritual I
[1:15:15] don't know which one is it we can walk
[1:15:18] and God will guide those very Footsteps
[1:15:21] in his word that's right amen so we'll
[1:15:24] go in there how many times Saints I know
[1:15:26] it's happened to you you're reading your
[1:15:28] Bible and you have a question about what
[1:15:30] what does this mean and that day the
[1:15:32] next day whatever bam there's the answer
[1:15:35] amen that's God ordering your Footsteps
[1:15:38] in the
[1:15:40] word
[1:15:41] hallelujah now you know we live in a day
[1:15:45] that people really have lost their focus
[1:15:48] yes uh very very much we just look in
[1:15:50] the world today I saw a little clip here
[1:15:54] a few days ago
[1:15:56] of a giant giant Church they had a stage
[1:15:58] as big as our building and um they had a
[1:16:02] Halloween
[1:16:04] party in their
[1:16:07] church I mean goblins and Ghouls and you
[1:16:12] know in the house of
[1:16:14] God cuz they're trying to connect to the
[1:16:17] kids in their
[1:16:18] Community now I want to ask you did they
[1:16:20] bring the kids up or did they go
[1:16:23] down yeah see so not really a
[1:16:27] correct understanding of the
[1:16:31] word their idea of reaching out
[1:16:33] spreading the
[1:16:36] gospel on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:16:39] brother brandom says this here he said
[1:16:42] now this is a little bit of a shift but
[1:16:44] just follow me amen because we've been
[1:16:46] talking about looking in the right
[1:16:48] direction the ark was so
[1:16:51] constructed parentheses when you were
[1:16:54] once in it there was only oh I I'm going
[1:16:58] to Spill the Beans I have it marked
[1:16:59] right down in there my brother and
[1:17:01] sister it doesn't matter what the arc is
[1:17:03] if you're not in it that's right amen
[1:17:05] there's a lot of things we can say if
[1:17:07] this and if that ought to be but if
[1:17:09] you're not in it you can't really
[1:17:11] critique what it is amen so when you
[1:17:14] think about the rest of this quote and
[1:17:16] some of you already read the whole thing
[1:17:18] but anyway amen once in it there was
[1:17:22] only one window in it and it was right
[1:17:24] in the top you couldn't look sideways
[1:17:27] you couldn't look no way but straight up
[1:17:31] and that's the way the ark Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] is you can't look at the next fellow you
[1:17:37] can't look at nothing but Christ when
[1:17:40] you're in the ark because there's only
[1:17:42] one door and he is that door we talked
[1:17:45] about this morning you have to keep
[1:17:48] looking up amen and then the finish of
[1:17:51] that he says for he that put his hand to
[1:17:53] the plow even turned to look back not
[1:17:55] worthy of the plowing but let's look at
[1:17:57] this let's break this down for a minute
[1:17:59] my brother and sister there's almost
[1:18:01] always in every uh paragraph or deal
[1:18:05] there's something that unlocks the rest
[1:18:07] of it there's something that opens up
[1:18:09] the writing and so the ark was so
[1:18:13] constructed yeah and very important see
[1:18:16] they put it in parentheses but how
[1:18:18] important it is that if we're going to
[1:18:22] look at this whole picture from the
[1:18:25] outside the
[1:18:27] ark we're G have a whole another picture
[1:18:30] that's right that's
[1:18:32] right exactly right I was reading a deal
[1:18:35] concerning the the ark encounter or
[1:18:38] whatever they call that back East
[1:18:41] there and this man was a Critic of it he
[1:18:44] said I was going to go visit it to see
[1:18:47] what it represented and I drove up in
[1:18:50] the parking
[1:18:52] lot and I looked at it and it was
[1:18:55] huge but it wasn't big enough to hold
[1:18:58] all the animals I turned around and I
[1:19:03] left
[1:19:09] H the prophet said it takes Faith right
[1:19:13] but I've never seen that kind of
[1:19:16] Faith so I don't think faith will do
[1:19:22] it how are they looking at it that's it
[1:19:26] not giving God the chance to raise Faith
[1:19:30] up in them or reveal the faith that's
[1:19:32] already in
[1:19:34] them they just simply looked at it from
[1:19:36] that direction and says there's simply
[1:19:38] no way to have faith enough to overcome
[1:19:43] lodosa so instead of wasting my years
[1:19:46] I'm just going to stop
[1:19:48] now if you've ever seen the gold diggers
[1:19:53] cartoon it shows the man with a pick
[1:19:55] starting on the outside of the mountain
[1:19:57] and he's picking and he's but frame by
[1:20:00] frame he's digging a tunnel and it gets
[1:20:03] deeper and deeper and deeper deeper and
[1:20:05] then appearing in the edge of the frame
[1:20:07] is something that is the same color as
[1:20:10] gold and he's digging and he's digging
[1:20:13] and he's
[1:20:14] digging and he gets right
[1:20:17] there within that little
[1:20:20] breath and says I knew it there was
[1:20:23] nothing here
[1:20:30] here have we stop short
[1:20:35] yeah were we called to stop short no sir
[1:20:39] no you see it's all depending on whether
[1:20:43] we see the Promise as real and enough to
[1:20:46] give our whole life to it whether we see
[1:20:50] any outward result now when I say that
[1:20:54] I'm not talking about us with no
[1:20:56] evidence that God's with
[1:20:57] us but do you know I read a story very
[1:21:01] old book that was given to me a story of
[1:21:04] a missionary went to
[1:21:07] Africa spent I think almost 40 years
[1:21:11] there and when he was old he finally
[1:21:13] come back to
[1:21:16] America and they asked him hey what was
[1:21:18] the results you spent all those years
[1:21:20] there and he he told them he says
[1:21:23] well I really didn't have a lot of
[1:21:27] results and people are
[1:21:31] like oh you were there all those years
[1:21:35] and you don't have much for
[1:21:37] results no but you should have seen what
[1:21:40] the Lord
[1:21:43] did see it's all how we look at it man
[1:21:47] was expecting him to say we converted
[1:21:49] 10,000 or whatever it might be but he
[1:21:52] went there and realized that he had not
[1:21:55] done a single thing and God was the one
[1:21:59] behind it the whole time amen so he had
[1:22:03] the humility to declare I did not do
[1:22:06] anything I have no results but my you
[1:22:11] should have seen what the Lord did so as
[1:22:15] you look at this my brother and sister
[1:22:17] God look at the real understanding of
[1:22:21] the architecture of the the ark
[1:22:25] how would you and I feel if if you know
[1:22:27] there had been windows in those days you
[1:22:29] know and and we are we are looking out a
[1:22:32] window and the waves are taller than the
[1:22:35] ark we are looking out the window and
[1:22:37] we're seeing dead bodies Float by and
[1:22:40] huge trees ripped out by the roots
[1:22:42] floating and and we're look at that how
[1:22:44] would we react to that and God says I
[1:22:47] know how I made you and I know what I
[1:22:51] called you to so bear with me amen
[1:22:54] there's times I just have to keep you in
[1:22:56] the dark that's it that's right and I
[1:22:59] put this to you this way because it's
[1:23:01] true when you look into
[1:23:04] demonology if we walk out the doors of
[1:23:06] this church today if you go to a
[1:23:08] restaurant to eat or or somewhere
[1:23:10] tonight I guess we're eating in the
[1:23:11] basement so that part would be but
[1:23:13] you're going somewhere my brother and
[1:23:16] sister if you saw the demons that are
[1:23:18] out here in this world it would terrify
[1:23:21] you and I you say I'm a Believer I've
[1:23:22] got faith you'd be terrified my brother
[1:23:24] and sister so God keeps you and I to a
[1:23:27] degree understand me I'm not talking
[1:23:29] about absolute I'm talking to a degree
[1:23:31] he keeps us in the dark we feel those
[1:23:34] Spirits we we understand that presence
[1:23:38] that's there but if you realize if you
[1:23:40] saw a whole gang of
[1:23:43] demons you'd be
[1:23:46] terrified but God says you know what
[1:23:48] I'll let it be real enough for you to
[1:23:51] understand because you see they can't
[1:23:53] defeat me and you and I are one amen oh
[1:23:59] how simple God made this gospel he
[1:24:02] didn't make it some complicated thing
[1:24:04] for us to have to work our way through
[1:24:06] and find how to get every piece and be
[1:24:09] able to put it in place he said you know
[1:24:11] what when the time comes going back to
[1:24:12] our other deal when the time comes I'll
[1:24:14] guide your footsteps to the realm that
[1:24:17] you will understand who you are and why
[1:24:20] you're here and what you're facing and
[1:24:22] what your reward is
[1:24:24] amen oh my sometimes Humanity just needs
[1:24:27] to be reminded am amen I love that amen
[1:24:31] you can't look at nothing but Christ
[1:24:33] when you're in the ark because there's
[1:24:36] only one door amen and that one way is
[1:24:41] Jesus Christ isn't that beautiful I I
[1:24:44] love the quote as I look at amen now as
[1:24:47] we go on here uh so look at Isaiah
[1:24:52] 45:22 and the reason I po this up
[1:24:55] because in the next quote I'm going to
[1:24:56] read brother brandham refers to this so
[1:24:58] it says look unto me and be saved in all
[1:25:01] the ends of the Earth for I am God and
[1:25:04] there is none other so full context
[1:25:07] right there he's laying down a
[1:25:09] foundation for us now in Look Away to
[1:25:11] Jesus brother brandom says here uh the
[1:25:14] Bible said in Isaiah
[1:25:16] 45:22 we find that God says look unto me
[1:25:19] all the ends of the Earth and now when
[1:25:21] the Earth has come to its end or or
[1:25:24] system of the Earth has come to its ends
[1:25:27] let the people look unto him
[1:25:30] amen I want to ask you are we getting
[1:25:34] close I I would say we're getting
[1:25:37] close not speaking ill because we must
[1:25:40] all fulfill prophecy but Mr
[1:25:43] Putin is saying you know what you do
[1:25:46] this I think I might just nuke
[1:25:48] you my brother and sister I don't I'm
[1:25:50] not going to jump up and say oh that's
[1:25:52] it that's it but my brother and sister
[1:25:54] you're starting to see a a conversation
[1:25:57] right that's pointing to the vision
[1:26:00] brother Brown says and I saw America a
[1:26:03] smoldering ruin that's
[1:26:06] right will it come
[1:26:09] unprovoked
[1:26:10] no no it will
[1:26:13] be other factors in the world poking
[1:26:17] poking poking pushing threatening all of
[1:26:21] this and one day they'll be fully now I
[1:26:23] know none of you ever done this but it
[1:26:25] does happen when people retaliate
[1:26:27] because they feel like somebody's pushed
[1:26:28] them too
[1:26:30] far so you look at this I'm not even it
[1:26:34] doesn't matter but I'm not even going to
[1:26:36] blame Mr Putin there'll come a day that
[1:26:39] he will feel or whoever is in control
[1:26:41] will feel they've been pushed too far
[1:26:44] they're going to feel the only option
[1:26:46] they
[1:26:47] have
[1:26:50] y
[1:26:52] terrifying let's just sit down for a
[1:26:54] minute just dig into this the idea that
[1:26:56] you look up and you see a vapor trail
[1:26:59] and it's Landing in Mountain Home Air
[1:27:01] Force
[1:27:02] Base and you think well we're 80 miles
[1:27:05] away from Mountain Home Air Force Base
[1:27:08] Google says it has a blast radius of 240
[1:27:14] miles what are we going to
[1:27:17] vaporized that's
[1:27:20] terrifying except for the bride that's
[1:27:23] right won't be
[1:27:25] here hallelujah that's what the word
[1:27:27] says amen that's what God's Prophet come
[1:27:29] and brought that Clarity to you and I
[1:27:32] we're not going to be there at that time
[1:27:36] so don't let's not sound harsh forgive
[1:27:38] me if I sound harsh but if the fact that
[1:27:40] a nuke hits Mountain Home Air Force
[1:27:43] Base how much impact has that got on
[1:27:47] you the truth of it is none at all
[1:27:51] unless we open the door and let Satan
[1:27:55] into our mind and let him torment us
[1:27:58] what's going to happen that's right but
[1:28:02] let's leave Russia out of it have you
[1:28:04] guys heard of this giant volcano they
[1:28:06] call
[1:28:09] Yellowstone and the Earth's groaning
[1:28:12] remember reading in your scripture where
[1:28:14] where the O Earth is groaning amen amen
[1:28:18] the Earth is not just rattling a little
[1:28:20] bit the Earth is
[1:28:22] groaning and I don't think the
[1:28:24] scientists are wrong I think probably
[1:28:26] you know about the time a nuke hits
[1:28:27] Mountain Home Yellowstone will say woo I
[1:28:29] got to let off the pressure yeah now see
[1:28:33] what happens my brother and sister we
[1:28:34] can sit here and worry about those
[1:28:35] things or we can look in the right
[1:28:38] direction and say the word says that's
[1:28:41] right the word says that's right amen
[1:28:44] amen Joseph's wife
[1:28:47] already in the house amen and the
[1:28:51] prophet of God says and that is a type
[1:28:54] for the bride amen amen already in the
[1:28:58] house in the meantime you know I do
[1:29:01] recommend you store up a little extra
[1:29:03] food a little water cuz you
[1:29:08] know you watch how people
[1:29:11] drive you might not have any power lines
[1:29:13] at your house it won't be the Russians
[1:29:16] and it won't be a volcano it'll just
[1:29:18] simply be some crazy person nobody here
[1:29:22] has one so somebody in a big Ford
[1:29:25] Excursion Isaac and Christian used to
[1:29:27] but they got
[1:29:29] delivered so I think we're getting close
[1:29:32] now you might say we heard this
[1:29:34] generation after generation we've heard
[1:29:37] this for a long time that is true and
[1:29:40] it's been preached for a long time many
[1:29:42] ministers has took this same text
[1:29:44] thousands of them but here is the thing
[1:29:46] I want to ask you tonight for these next
[1:29:49] few minutes when you look the question
[1:29:53] is
[1:29:54] what do you see when you look that's
[1:29:58] right do you see war in the Middle East
[1:30:00] do you see war in in Europe do you see
[1:30:02] war in maybe upper uh South America do
[1:30:07] you
[1:30:08] see
[1:30:09] what what do we see I see a bride that's
[1:30:13] it Revelations 196 that is prepared for
[1:30:17] her husband that's what I see I I'm not
[1:30:20] looking to to what this politician and
[1:30:23] what this communist and what this
[1:30:25] socialist and what this deal here and
[1:30:27] what what all Global government oh we're
[1:30:30] terrified Global government I tell you I
[1:30:32] have a global government there's only
[1:30:34] one who controls my world and his name
[1:30:37] is Jesus Christ amen he's Rich he owns a
[1:30:40] cattle on a 10,000 Hills probably to not
[1:30:43] to contradict scripture he owns a cattle
[1:30:46] on every Hill amen and you look at that
[1:30:49] my brother and sister what is it we're
[1:30:52] looking at that's it
[1:30:57] that's
[1:30:58] right now he
[1:31:01] said look unto
[1:31:03] me all the ends of the Earth Moses
[1:31:06] lifted the serpent up and whoever looks
[1:31:09] got healed now it depends on what you're
[1:31:13] looking for right amen I don't want to
[1:31:17] go too long here need to
[1:31:20] stop my brother and sister was there a
[1:31:24] reason for any Israelite to die in the
[1:31:27] wilderness from being bitten by a
[1:31:31] serpent absolutely not one Israelite
[1:31:35] should have
[1:31:37] died but you imagine just as it was when
[1:31:40] the prophet was on the scene that's it
[1:31:43] that's
[1:31:46] nonsense that's out of some Egyptian
[1:31:49] folklore that we can look on an image of
[1:31:53] a snake
[1:31:54] and be healed
[1:31:57] nonsense and it spread yeah but You'
[1:32:01] have thought after they watched one die
[1:32:04] they might have
[1:32:05] reconsidered let show you how stubborn
[1:32:07] Satan is and the spirits that go with
[1:32:09] that how stubborn those are now we're
[1:32:12] going to hold to our belief in the first
[1:32:13] church of Egypt they told us that was
[1:32:16] false
[1:32:18] Doctrine nobody gets healed
[1:32:24] all they had to do is look and live
[1:32:26] that's right all they had to do is turn
[1:32:29] and look in the right direction here's
[1:32:31] the brais and Serpent and they chose to
[1:32:33] stare off across the Horizon as they
[1:32:36] started to shake and quiver and
[1:32:39] collapse and the answer was right there
[1:32:42] before them y amen but they wouldn't
[1:32:45] look and therefore they didn't live
[1:32:48] that's
[1:32:50] it now it depends on what you're looking
[1:32:52] for I've seen people coming into the
[1:32:55] meetings in this last day can only be
[1:32:58] able to sit in the meeting for just
[1:33:00] about one or two minutes that's all they
[1:33:03] could stand see they couldn't stand
[1:33:06] it now let's not be boastful about this
[1:33:09] my brother and sister but through the
[1:33:10] years we've had dozens upon dozens of
[1:33:13] people come and sit make statements like
[1:33:17] I'm looking my Bible while that's being
[1:33:19] preached and I see that's what it says
[1:33:23] walk out the door never come
[1:33:27] back meet that person on the street and
[1:33:30] they greet you hey how are you doing
[1:33:33] doing good hey what are you up to oh but
[1:33:36] and they're just like yeah okay it was
[1:33:38] so nice to visit you that
[1:33:40] day see they they don't want to
[1:33:43] look they don't want to live it's not in
[1:33:47] them and we don't say that with
[1:33:49] arrogance but I know a bride when the
[1:33:52] word come their way
[1:33:54] God opened it they said that's what I've
[1:33:58] looked for my whole
[1:34:00] life oh my brother and sister we hear
[1:34:03] these and I don't want to just go off
[1:34:04] into this but we hear these and we think
[1:34:06] well you know good people my brother and
[1:34:09] sister there are ladies
[1:34:12] sisters that absolutely were fulfillment
[1:34:16] of scripture in this day for they were
[1:34:20] prostitutes and they've been
[1:34:22] delivered and and God cleansed them and
[1:34:25] gave them a new
[1:34:28] life and then people would look down
[1:34:31] instead of saying that's the word living
[1:34:34] again they would look down on that and
[1:34:36] say I don't know about that can God save
[1:34:40] that
[1:34:41] person see we got to be careful make
[1:34:44] sure what we're looking for is correct
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:49] hallelujah okay we close right here
[1:34:53] Hebrews 12 1-3 wherefore seeing we're
[1:34:57] also compassed about with so great a
[1:34:59] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:35:03] every weight and sin which does so
[1:35:06] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:35:09] patience the race that is set before us
[1:35:11] looking unto Jesus amen what is it we're
[1:35:15] choosing to look unto Jesus amen we're
[1:35:18] not turning our head away from him we're
[1:35:20] looking to him because that's our only
[1:35:22] hope in fact that's our only desire
[1:35:25] we're we're not part of this world out
[1:35:27] here so how can you be identified with
[1:35:29] something you're not a part of
[1:35:32] right looking to Jesus the author and
[1:35:34] finish of our faith who for the joy that
[1:35:36] was set before him endured the cross
[1:35:40] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:35:43] the right hand of the Throne of God for
[1:35:46] consider him that endureth such
[1:35:48] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:58] maybe you won't see it the same way I
[1:36:01] do he endured the contradiction of
[1:36:04] Sinners against himself
[1:36:07] yeah how it must hurt
[1:36:10] him when we are the
[1:36:14] contradiction Lord help
[1:36:16] us Lord help us don't let me be a
[1:36:20] contradiction that's right I want to
[1:36:23] look to you Lord and just as it was the
[1:36:25] Brazen serpent I want to look to you
[1:36:27] Lord and I want to live I want your word
[1:36:30] to heal me heal my soul heal my thoughts
[1:36:34] my mind my emotion physical body
[1:36:37] too I don't want to be the contradiction
[1:36:42] amen lest you be wearied and faint in
[1:36:45] your minds sister VI if you would come
[1:36:48] musicians I guess I should
[1:36:50] say hallelujah
[1:36:53] God bless you it's good to be here
[1:36:55] today amen it's good my spirit feels
[1:36:59] much lighter I get to unload these
[1:37:01] thoughts you know and unload this and
[1:37:04] realize what I'm going to
[1:37:06] see is what I'm looking for there's
[1:37:09] several other things brother brandham
[1:37:11] says through the through the
[1:37:12] message but if we're not even looking
[1:37:14] for it how are you going to see
