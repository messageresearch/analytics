God bless you my friend I'm going to preach about you today amen I just totally forgot that one of these weekends you were coming and we're going to take our thought from The Book of Job today and uh not a finer young man there is walks in shoe leather and I'm glad to call him my friend Amen brother Moses God bless you my dear friend sister Danelle amen uh let's look at this and uh I just want to say God bless you Elizabeth amen been a while and sister Rachel right yes God bless all of you amen uh just uh so happy to have you here and this day of natural Fellowship after the service to be able to just visit amen I bring greetings from Brother Jose sister Sefi and the children they were passing through from Colorado and so we had the privilege to eat lunch with them yesterday and uh just to uh they asked for prayer for them and the church in the Tri-Cities and I don't know one of these days we're going to have to have I I don't know what you call it I know some brothers would call it a missionary trip but I want to take some of our Ukrainian brothers and sisters to the Tri-Cities with me they have been having uh I'll get this number wrong I think it was 14 15 16 ukrainians from uh been attending a Pentecostal Church there in the Tri-Cities but by their own admission they've just been hungry they're not being fed they're watching the decline of the church the standards and they're just hungry and uh brother Jose met them and they've been visiting the church for a few Services brother Jose asked yesterday that we would come up here in the near future and and Minister and I thought would be nothing finer than to take some with me that could really really relate and interact and there's there's just a lovely atmosphere there amen let's uh remember our sister April I don't see her this morning I know she has a very convoluted work schedule uh just to lift her up in prayer Also let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Job And I want to speak to you this morning on things that are to be and a title to see him as he is and to see us as we are now my brother and sister to see us as we are is not to stand in front of a mirror and inspect ourselves in that mirror because I'm sorry to tell you that this flesh will always have something that disappoints you there'll always be something that we have said or done and we would then be focused by the devil would focus us back to that and we'll never be satisfied in this flesh but the most important thing my brother and sister is to see who we are in Jesus Christ and to do that we have to see him as he is we cannot just look him as a God that's in the heavens uh that uh you know died for us but he has personality right the prophet of God and explaining the Trinity uh talking about the godhead says you know what you can't have a person without a personality and what we want to do is see God in his personality my brother and sister you say well brother Paul how is that well the personality is the expression of who that person is Right some people are just naturally quiet uh that's identified as their personality some are a little more boisterous identified in their personality some very humble some not so so we want to see God as he is and I trust today by God's grace we can just kind of bring out or Express this as we look here in the Book of Job starting with the 38th chapter in the first verse now you are very familiar with the Book of Job right I believe every one of us has read the book of Job many times over and studied that because it's in there we see this great trial this great uh uh uh battle that is there and we all know just for a moment of foundation we all know that if job had known exactly who he was and what God thought about him it would have just taken all the sting of the battle away and no because we are in an age that God's been revealed the book has been opened and there's still sting in the battle there's still travail they're still uh uh I don't know there's a hundred words that would describe it but you know what I'm saying it it's still the battle is still real and We Know What God Says About Us now job is in a position that he is obedient to God he is serving God and God's Own testimony says nope this is a man that I have complete confidence in complete trust in he is a faithful man he is serving me and job didn't really know 100 that that's how God felt about him so as we'll read this I just want to do that because we want to come and cover uh 38 chapters in that little discourse right there then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words with all knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me this my brother and sister was not a passive interaction this was God speaking directly I just want to take a moment has God spoke directly to us amen sometimes it's not comfortable sometimes it does not feel good sometimes God tells us you know what I can't hardly even feel the heat from you but you are a son of God so therefore I'm going to not judge you I'm going to rekindle the flame aren't you glad he comes to rekindle the flame amen but he tells him gird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who house stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning star sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy or who shut up the sea with doors when it Break Forth as if it had issued out of the womb when I made the cloud the Garment thereof and thick Darkness a swaddling ban for it and break up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors and said hitherto shalt Thou come but no further and here shalt thou thy proud waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and calls the day spring to know his place very strong conversation very direct God was tired of the position that job was occupying I wonder Saints if you don't mind me just being a little straightforward today I just wonder if sometimes God's not tired of the position we're occupying some strong words we in the human nature don't like strong words do we we don't rejoice as it were to be spoken strongly to but what if God says it's time Church to move time to come out of your position time to quit looking at your Calamity and recognize this is greater than your calamity Heavenly Father we thank you Lord today for your grace your mercy Lord for a time to come and fellowship around the word of God father for you to speak to our hearts and Lord even though I am just a man and I am here with brothers and sisters just men and women we ask you Lord speak strongly to us move us from our position father if our position is not pleasing father bring us into a greater understanding revelation of you Lord we ask this morning Father Lord come down move in our midst speak to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I trust today that each and every one of us could just simply look at this today and take this as a position that God desired to speak to us amen he's not speaking to the one on the other end of the pew he's speaking directly to us now we'll look in job one you don't need to turn there unless you desire to but we see in Job 1 the first chapter that the sons of God were coming before the Lord to present themselves and it was there that they had come to worship and give praise to God but right there on the tail of that comes Satan also into the presence of God and he comes in there now my brother and sister you talk about bold he didn't try to sneak in he just marched in and sometimes that's what happens you know is the devil he just comes and marches in and has an impact upon us and we we don't maybe understand exactly how he could be so bold but we're seeing that he was bold enough to come into the presence of God so he's just pretty bold amen and you look at this and as the whole chapter starts to break down we don't see God grudgingly offering job up for a test God readily offers job up he he doesn't hesitate he says have you considered my servant job so God was not in the least like will job be able to stand this test well will this work out the way I had planned it but God knew exactly where he stood he knew exactly deep down in the heart of job where he stood and he knew that job would be able to stand this test and he readily offers job up to be as we would say in this day and age the guinea pig and it's there that he come now my brother and sister Satan was so confident that he believed that he could cause by the Affliction of the flesh he could cause job to curse God my brother and sister the devil will come in many times he wants to come in in the age that we're living in we understand that it's a season that many false prophets are testified or prophesied to come in and Satan will deceive some by the word but some people my brother and sister just have travail of Flesh travail of life and they just get weary and well doing and Satan just keeps is wearing away at them till they give up but my brother and sister whenever a son or daughter of God has that true seed down in the soul may give up and then something starts carrying them amen something starts holding them and walking as we see in the footsteps on the sands of time and various examples and songs that it's there my brother and sister in our greatest trials he was there all the time can someone say amen amen we kind of think well what is going on in our life what is happening in our family what is happening in our church but I'm telling you my brother and sister he said he would be here he is here and I'm here this morning to testify to you he is here amen we are not sitting here without a God in our presence today but we are setting him and he is waiting many times my brother and sister for us just to call out his name amen he's just waiting for us to reach out to him and we oftentimes believe my brother and sister that that God should come first and offer to help but his word said that I come I'm paraphrasing I come to those who call out my name Amen in our darkest time on trial we should be calling out the name of Jesus Christ louder than ever before amen and so we look and see how that he comes and and uh job my I wonder what job's reaction would have been if he could have looked beyond the veil and saw this taking place and see his God offering him up saying no problem do anything you want to him just don't take his life now my brother and sister to clarify a little on that you realize that the sea Gene of eternal life is in you Satan can't take your life if he wanted to he can take this old Flash but what is this flash compared to the glory in the presence of God Amen so we see how Satan's already limited and so it's there Satan believed that the trials of this life would cause job to curse God but little did he know how strong the seed that had been planted in job in the beginning my brother and sister Satan believes that and he still believes he still believes that he can take and turn Sons and Daughters of God away from the word of God away from our Lord Jesus Christ by simply uh uh giving them trials that are great and we see many people fail and fall under those trials my brother and sister but I'm speaking to the true word seed of Jesus Christ today amen we're not talking just a human flesh because it's that true word seed that won't allow your flesh to quit because I'm telling you if that wasn't the truth we would have quit already amen we've already come on can somebody lift a hand and say we've already faced trials that would have caused us to quit but there's something that's keeping us amen and that is that word seed Gene that has been placed amen you know what happens is we look at the life of Job and see how Satan started he starts right in in the family takes away children he takes away possessions job wasn't worried about the possessions my brother and sister but he did grieve him about his children and it come to a place that his wife so grieved was there she said I've lost my children why don't you just Curse God and then you'll be lost to me too and then I can just settle down into the deepest pit of despair my brother and sister it's there in that realm she didn't know what she was speaking because she did not see the big picture job as he is dealing with his friends imagine you've got friends that are coming down saying you know what for this to come upon you you must have secret sin I pray that the ministry will never come and take a position that when someone's going through a hard trial that they would automatically assume there has to be sin maybe God said this is my servant I'll open the Hedge Satan I'll let you do everything you want to do because they will not turn their back on me and yet people would say well this happened or that happened I wonder what sin is in their life my brother and sister we need to be careful we don't understand the plan of God if we did we'll we'll touch on that a little later if we did we would be all seeing to see the plan of God but we're not all seeing amen we are just Men In the Flesh as ministers we can be anointed by God to speak truth and speak the word but my brother and sister God still veils the prophet of God said God doesn't show Everything To His prophets so there was a prophet people said well now how could brother Branham have said good words about this individual and that individual considering what they are my brother and sister God chose to hide those things from the prophet or if the prophet knew he never spoke them so it's not always expedient my brother and sister so you look at this friends and family imagine you're sitting now around your fire and boils have come upon you now I think we've all had a blister maybe from work or from hiking or something does it feel better to break the blister to leave it neither one feels good I've never met a blister yet that I liked because if you break them it's painful and if you leave them it's painful so job is in this position and the scripture shows us clearly how he's setting there scraping his boils he chose that route and his friends come on what did you do Joe were your friends we go to church together we socialize together what did you do there has to be there has to be job you're scraping boils you've lost your children you've lost your house your animals you've lost all of these things job there's got to be a sin in your life but let's go back and God said no here's a man who is perfect before me see no Revelation to the friends and to the family they could not see the plan of God but God was there all the time with a plan amen they were not just wandering they were actually anointed to follow this plan of God and so they see the struggle they see the Calamity and they're sure that there's an issue my brother and sister you realize that Satan's goal he doesn't care about our flesh no more than nothing he's trying to break our connection that we have with God that's all he's interested in is breaking the connection we have with God and if he can break that connection then we are like a ship without a Rudder we are just floating aimlessly on the sea of life and now the Calamity of Life won't change my brother and sister go out here in the world they don't suddenly have it better when they quit serving God Amen it gets worse because they're now on the sea of life without a sail and without a Rudder amen we ought to thank God today what he's doing in our life because we have a sail the word amen and we have his guiding hand as a Rudder and we need to just stick the course and say whatever it is Lord let me be a job amen I might be discouraged I might be broken down I might believe God has forsaken me but the truth of it is I'm in God's plan can we say Amen to that today I am in God's plan not always maybe in his perfect will but I am in his will amen so you look at this sometimes things happen in life I want each of you if you would please just to look back in your own life and there's things that have happened we cannot explain but you know God's doing punishing us glad you didn't buy that God is molding us because without a struggle character is not molded we've heard that preach like how many times couple zillion but did hearing it preached mold character in you all God was doing was making you aware that you are going to face something that's going to mold character in you now to some the idea of being molded that way they say if God was a loving God if God was a loving God he would bring us to this position he wouldn't cause this to happen in our life but God is a loving God can we say Amen to that this morning and God says I know oh I hope you don't mind me getting personal today but some of you are so stubborn amen that just telling you this needs to be molten in your life would just be like rain on a duck's back amen but God says I know exactly what it will take to bring you to a place and when you see the end of the story you will turn around and say thank you Lord amen because the end of the story for us as the passing of our brother Gideon people oh he's gone he's gone no my brother and sister it's the start of the real story it's the start of the story that down in our soul that we long for it's a life that we have longed for it's a start amen it's only the finished of a past house and God moving us so we're saying oh how can this be Lord my life here this is not our life our life is in Jesus Christ amen and we look around this world right now and we can get caught up is it easy to get caught up amen reminds me of a little story I say this a little bit in humor reminds me of a story of a man once told his wife he said they had twins he said I want to build bunk beds for the twins she said are you sure and he said yeah I'll save some money about five thousand dollars worth of tools later they have bunk beds and his wife said I had no idea bunk beds were that expensive but my brother and sister we can get so caught up in something I need this I need that I got to do this I have to do this got to go here got to go there we get so focused on that the reality of our situation fades but God says I'm going to bring you focus because this is laodicea the most deceptive of Ages it's the blackest of times it is the culmination of all of these other ages brought together and tied together my brother and sister when you tie a demon to another demon you've got something that's pretty powerful but when you tie the holy ghost in a son or daughter of God to the Holy Ghost and a son or daughter of God you've got something more powerful than any demon ever amen and so God is coming and he's molding us and bringing us to a place that we can stand and say you know what I don't want to be job I don't want to be Joe my brother and sister I don't want to be sitting by the ash Heap and scraping my boils but I'm telling you every one of us will have a job experience every one of us will come to a place in our life that we'll look around family or friends or circumstance and we'll deny that for Jesus Christ amen we'll take a halt of that and say I'm sorry this is who I am en can you explain as the song says how do you explain my brother and sister we can't explain we sat here today we might be thinking oh there's things in my life are not good I don't like this I don't like that I want this to change change it change it don't change it by complaint don't change it oh I'm not preaching too hard am I you know when you got a dog in the back seat that constantly whines you know what you do you throw him out of the back seat and you throw him in the back of the truck now how much you think you're going to change God's mind by whining at least she was in the cab with him amen but whining becomes a habit hmm you know they say 30 days can create a habit some of it's been whining for 30 years no wonder God's got to move in such a fashion to break those spirits to break our our view of what this life is I'm going to serve the Lord I'm a Believer I believe the message of the hour amen but you know what God doesn't want you to whine while you're believing he wants you to shout amen he wants you to claim he wants you to stand up and say if God said it I believe it and it will come to pass and it don't matter what my Calamity is amen hallelujah look as we were speaking about job and our brother David preached a lovely service about job I hope he didn't steal too much of my thunder but you look at that my brother and sister job is there he looks this way he sees whale he looks this way he sees whale he looks this way sees whale he looks this way he sees whale he looks up he sees whale he looks down he sees whale vomit and God anointed him anointed him moved Beyond like woe is me but anointed him to say I see I see I look into the temple I look into the Tabernacle I look into the glory of God and God said he habits his praise of his people and God come right down into the belly of that whale and met him there and if God would come in the praise of of uh uh Jonah in the belly of the whale if God would come and meet him there my brother and sister if we'll lift a hand and lift a heart and say Lord I feel like complaining but I'm going to praise you instead I'm going to lift my hands to heaven and say thank you Lord this age 2023 you have called me and you have kept me and you'll take me through this circumstance too I was not called to live in this circumstance but I was called to live in your presence amen see what happens we can't explain it what is happening job thought how can this be how can this be my enemies have never they have never done this before I've never had this happen my house has never fallen down by strong winds and this and this all is why how can this all happen but he was there and ultimately deep down inside if I could present it to you this day this fashion deep down inside was a little box that was locked what do we call that box the soul job knew he was a son of God there was not a question but there was Revelation in that soul that had not been released and God said now is the season now is the time now is the circumstance I'm going to unlock the Revelation that's already down in that Soul now my brother and sister job would have stood in church lifted his hands he would have praised God he would have prayed for healing prayed for deliverance prayed for whatever is necessary for those around him but there was something that was not unlocked there there was something in job's experience that he had never experienced before and God says job I'm going to unlock this in you now is the season Satan is here Satan is powerful but I'm going to unlock something not just for you job but an example for ages gone by or I mean going coming I mean amen so it's there I'm going to unlock this that Believers in the future will be able to see this and understand that it's there for them also and so it's there Satan had beat him down I like mountain tops I love experiencing the Mountaintop but I tell you what I am who I am today because God has allowed me not only to go to the valley but fall off a cliff or two on the way down I don't like that time's way back years and years years long before I ever was a minister I come to places and I was like I think I'm just done I'm just done yep I'm just done and then find myself calling out to God what happened when I had got beaten so far that Satan says there I've got him right where I want him can someone say Amen got him right where I want him but something down inside started leaking out of the box amen something inside started to stir and it started to do and then we quit right no we didn't because we're here today because we couldn't quit because that was God himself inside stirring causing a rumbling amen causing a reaction amen so you look at that and realize my brother and sister what was happening with job job was a righteous man he was a church-going man he paid his tithe he was faithful in his posts of Duty but it was there when Satan had beat him down and it come to a place that him in that place even his own wife speaking has enough courage he didn't call her a fool but he says you speak as a foolish woman and the greatest thing that God can give us out of salvation outside of Salvation is a good wife you realize how defeated that household was to the point that job's own wife said I think God's forsaken us why don't you just curse him and just die get it over with we can't endure this any longer and it was in that position that Satan's ordering the balloons of the cake all of the little Hoots and whatever's for the party that God says now it's time for me to step on the scene now I'm going to show you I'm going to give you a breakdown job I'm going to give you a breakdown of what I already deposited in you I'm going to show you what's in there you knew oh can someone lift a hand and say thank you Lord we know there's something in there my brother and sister but God sometimes has to come and give the breakdown of what it really is inside of you and I we're not just Christians we have come as a prophet showed us as minor Gods at part of Jesus Christ himself in flesh today this is not a human that's buffeted by the winds this is God himself walking on the Earth today amen and we forget that we forget that but God wants to teach us that lesson in such a fashion we'll never forget oh have the trials been hard wait till God turns the heat up and we say I don't think I can handle anymore yes you can because you have God's Own nature amen as we know he could have on the cross called Ten Thousand Angels could have come leveled the whole city if he had wanted to but he was there and when it's a place then it reaches the ultimate level he's crying out Lord let this pass from me and did God take it away from him no sir he gave him strength to endure it gave him strength to finish the word in fact he himself declares it is finished he saw the culmination coming and he says it is finished I have saw the finish of the plan of God and I'm going to speak with confidence this morning my brother and sister that we will stand in that day in that hour and we ourselves will be able to speak the words of our Lord Jesus when we see that final run see that final gate the veil opened before us we'll be able to testify it is finished thank you Lord I would have quit here here here here but I have finished the race it is finished excuse me excited Hallelujah see this is not a god of History my brother and sister this time goes on I don't want to plant the wrong fought with you but I'm getting tired of us preaching the message as a message of History we preach the message look what brother Brown did in this meeting look what happened here prayed for this person the Holy Spirit come down delivered that it's the same God same God he's here today the same God Amen don't look back look for god let's look in our midst and say Lord we have needs and we got children that need the Holy Ghost we've got healings that need to take place we have all these things that we need in our body of Believers my brother and sister don't look back he's here amen the same God today is here in our midst amen and God's moving in ways we cannot even explain but he's moving amen amen amen he's the god of your present circumstance amen what did he do it comes to a place in a Time that God says job gird up yourself now how do we gird ourselves Saints the word shows us that we're clothed in the word of God what is that Christ himself amen amen we're not going over here trying to build us a paper mache dress gird yourself up I want answers from you Joe I want answers Joe I don't want a bunch of mumbling I don't want a bunch of complaining I don't want whining I want answers prophet of God gave us a very Stern word and indictment to the denominations what have you done with this Jesus called Christ he's coming he's asking a question of us what have we done with this Jesus called Christ are we making him welcome or do we call upon him in a time of convenience I've been guilty of that any of you I mean you don't have to admit it but I will admit I I have been in my life before in a time of my life before that I called on God out of convenience namely a pickup hanging by one rock over a large large Canyon I desperately wanted God to show up right at that moment I hadn't thought about him in the previous week two or three but I sure wanted him to show up right then and to finish the back story of that is when they finally hooked on to State snow plow hooked onto the pickup they're not supposed to but the guy says well I want to see your pickup fall down in the canyon while we wait for someone and they hooked on that and pulled the slack in the rock that was holding the pickup fell in the canyon to realize we are so close to calamity and had given zero attention to God but when we called on his name he came amen amen amen that's the God we serve Saints amen that's how faithful our God is why because he's not here my brother and sister we as the bride of Christ can we claim that today we as the bride of Christ are not here to be judged we're here to be purified we're here to be washed we're here to be prepared and God is anointing us to judge ourselves and that we would look in the word and say Lord help me to line up to this that's who I want to be Lord and I believe this was the heart of job but he could never maybe he could live the life but he couldn't really understand why that's one of the problems our young people have this day there's something stirring down in the heart and soul to serve God but they don't know why the world is so pretty the world is so pretty my brother and sister yeah the world is so pretty and yet there's something inside that says I want to serve God and the devil offers all kinds of reasons why we should serve him and God just says come follow me I'll guarantee you there's not one of us today would walk away or even think about walking away if we ever had been beyond the curtain of time one Glimpse beyond the curtain of time it would be finished but did you know that everything that's beyond the curtain of time is already in you come to with what is happening and I say every day that goes by I I can speak for myself I trust I'm speaking for you every day that goes by what's in the box is more real than it was yesterday what is it the same thing that happened to job is happening to you and I God is bringing us face to face with not a religion not a message of the hour not God's Central Prophet but we are starting to see who we are in the plan of God and as it opens up the life becomes more real to us and there is more power put on display you say brother Paul where's that power you're overcoming aren't you you're still standing aren't you you haven't give up laid down and died yet have you there's power coming to meet the circumstance we have the answer my brother and sister to the devil's question Hallelujah amen so God comes he says you know I want these answers where were you good question but aren't you glad today you can answer that question where were you I was in you Lord amen I was already manifested in you Lord I was in the palms of your hands I was in your heart I was written in the Lamb's Book of Life I know where I was when the foundation of the Earth was laid my brother and sister we have that benefit today that job did not understand he had not that Revelation but God has been gracious in our hour and every little thing of the word that has come people are there will are the Seals open or not is this this what about Thunders what about viles how about we build relationship and when we get relationship the importance of those things will be revealed to us and you'll find that your key to get into glory is not going to be explaining the Thunders or the vials my brother and sister it's going to be relationship with him Hallelujah for the word says He never he never spoken says uh uh now you didn't receive my education but he turns them away he says because I never knew you that's personal that's intimate well Hallelujah amen now I have the quote of all quotes here but the nice thing about it Saints is when we get through this quote we'll just almost be done now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek now my brother and sister when we realize that this person of Melchizedek was absolutely none other than our Lord Jesus Christ standing there and in that he was imparting right he himself no man has seen God so God stepped into a body though he could reveal himself and then people would just be looking on this body of Flesh amen thank you Lord has anybody seen Jesus Christ here at church this morning Hallelujah he's sitting all over these pews he's been worshiping he's been lifting his hands amen man saying Amen to the word oh God will say Amen to his own word you better believe it amen so if we understand who we are right this is part of the secret that's hid in the Box this is the part that we need Revelation to understand amen now look at this then later we never heard no more of Melchizedek because he become this would be amorphe Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet amen aren't you glad that we don't know all things oh my brother and sister I'm telling you in this human element if we knew all things we wouldn't get out of bed we'd make one last trip down to Walmart and buy thicker curtains bigger pillow bigger you know comforter and we would just curl up and snug down in there because the word of God shows us and the hour we live in that oh my Millions upon millions of demons have been turned loose I don't like the idea of going out there and facing those demons because you see this flesh man doesn't do well with demons but I'm telling you this Spirit man when this Spirit man catches a revelation of who he is amen we can walk out and say you know what I'm not afraid of the devil I'm not afraid of what he's done he might have a a dad a husband he might have a wife a daughter Sons whatever he might have I'm not afraid of those demons in the season that God ordained Amen in the season my brother and sister that God ordained but we get nervous we get nervous and a good shepherd can look out upon the flock and he can see the behavior of the Sheep and he don't have to go over there and ask him are you feeling all right or is there something going he can just see the behavior of the Sheep and he can recognize I have a real life experience of that once we were young men full of energy there was Lakes up in the Sawtooth way up there lakes that you had to hike for miles and miles and miles to get to them but the attraction was these great big fat fish giant fish and we went up fishing there in the Sawtooth one night and we got to the trailhead and it was dark and there was a sheep camp and the meadow was just clear full of sheep and there was the little trailer and uh the shepherd he was from Spain young man oh he was so excited the old guy just went in and went to bed the young guy was so excited he spoke good English and he sat down and we started visiting and pretty soon one of the dogs made a weird little and that old guy combusting out of their camp trailer young guy would stand on his feet and we're all like is there something there I had a pistol with me first thing you think a bear if you ever watched all those things a bear is going to pop out behind that little Bush right there with blood on its teeth big claws it's gonna look like a shadow moving across the land you know I'm to the pickup I got a gun a young man bear and the dog and those two Shepherds went running off in the dark and I was lying I hope he doesn't yell help because if he yells help I'm gonna drive to the top of the mountain and yell help myself later he had a big old Pyrenees dog there and that dog ran so fast now this might seem hard to believe it ran so fast you can't run through the Sheep there's so many sheep you can't run around them this dog literally leaped on top of the Sheep and ran across the backs of the sheep so fast the Sheep didn't even have time to react and then as there was just enough light we saw this black object going across the far end of the meadow being chased by a large white object going out and they come back and we're like that was really a bear and he goes oh yeah bear like slam yeah the bear amen the lion he likes lamb and God works in such mysterious ways it was the lesson I've never forgotten my life that in our little moment of security we were around the fire and all is well the sun has gone down and all is well but the enemy is just beyond the light are you with me Saints the enemy is just beyond the light the enemy didn't care the fire we had because there were sheep out there in the darkness and he could stay beyond the light and still get to sheep but God says I've called you out of Darkness into this glorious light amen this light is our protection it is not here to hurt us it's not here to make us feel bad about ourselves it's not here to discourage us it's here to keep us in this age that we live in this dark Wicked age is here to keep us and as a side note to that little story my brother and sister I felt compelled to go to the pickup there were several of us there wasn't just me and I bought this one pound bag of M M's peanuts M MS and I thought oh how to share and that young man sitting there across the fire and I pulled the top and peeled that back they didn't have zip lock back then I peeled that open he stood up come around the fire he didn't put his hand out can I have some he's like I love I love you know what happened I got a few peanuts he finally just took the back from me and went on his side the fire and ate them all now my brother and sister I want to say let's get around the fire let's not be selfish let's let the word of God be something that is so in us oh so desirous to us I don't want just a little bit I want my hands filled in fact just give me all of it amen because I have a desire for that later he told us he says I apologize I feel so bad but he says I sometimes dream of them you come like Adam like me you come from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted wow Lord couldn't I have just took a little written test hmm be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it come on my brother and sister we're standing here I promise you that every one of you of you be honest this morning will be sitting here saying Lord I don't understand why I don't understand what has happened here I don't understand it I don't understand how I have a son that I raised my wife and I raised in the house of God he knows the truth even to this day he will tell you I know it's the truth Dad but he doesn't live it I don't understand that but one thing I do know is a prophet of God stood on the word and said if I'll put the blood on the doorposting on the lentil if I will clean my house out if I will do these things my God will take care of the rest I just have to believe Hallelujah see we don't have to understand everything but I'm telling you when the box starts getting broken open it don't matter where they're at or what the circumstance is and job's position it didn't matter when it started to come job started to catch a revelation there was something there that job had not caught before my brother and sister amen we don't understand it we've never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word hmm I'm the word I'm not I'm not contradicting the prophet I am the word but that word is resident in this flesh so the word is sound here in the box and the box has got to be opened up and as we get farther down the road here there's more coming out that we start to understand understand what is it doing it's bringing us into the presence of almighty God it is not religion where we sign up and we agree and we do and we follow my brother and sister this is the word already deposited in you taking over your body your mind your thoughts your attributes oh Hallelujah now what is the rapture body change this actually becoming kind of a controversial thing in the message believe it or not maybe not out into the church realm so much but definitely hit the preacher Realm some say we're already in the Millennium so we can do whatever we want when you all leave church today just empty your wallet really nonsense nonsense my brother and sister but Millennium is not going to have that out there what are people thinking but they have struggled all they can struggle they've come to the end of their strength and they won't allow the Holy Ghost to take them further God sent a prophet I'm sorry to speak so direct it's more than God sent to Prophet amen the prophet said I want to introduce you to Jesus Christ amen there is the introduction that matters amen there's where the box as it were the soul starts to be opened up and what God's already placed in there starts to come out and take hosts you know you realize my brother and sister were just a host to the Holy Ghost right hey Ben yeah just a dwelling place we're just the host we open the door we let him in amen but when we open the door to let him in he's actually coming out yeah because he already put the seed in there it's already there we opened it up amen free moral agency we say Lord come into me sir our Lord I want to serve you I need to and then the door opens and he comes out and the body starts to change a whole nother sermon amen so but and look clearly it makes it clear you'll never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning see you you can't suddenly just become the word people say oh praise God I got saved you know yeah you did but you always was it just now is an Awakening to who you always have been there's an Awakening that's taking place that's right it proves the predestination of God say you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany right how glorious that would have been just to move right into a theophany form but what character would we have now if you never had any trials never no Temptations you always lived in the presence of God that would be wonderful but that wasn't the plan you see how Satan I just want to interject this it's not my notes but I want to interject this you see how Satan has has fooled us we get this mindset ourselves or maybe we're judgmental to apply it to someone else here's a family they put a lot of Trials what's wrong with them well let me present you another chapter of this here's a family many trials oh how much confidence God must have in them now God uses trials to move us I'm not taking that away sometimes God uses fiery trials to move us amen when nothing else will move us the preaching of the word won't move us God just says okay I'll let's fiery trial we've got to be careful about praying oh Lord take this family or this person's struggle away from them that's not our business leave that to God but my brother and sister let's not be judgmental either because we don't know but what God had so much confidence in job if job was in our service today amen and we have our brother job but if job was here in the service today many of us will look and say what is wrong with you when in reality there was so much that was right and God was actually just opening the word to job kind of in a rough way can you be handled rough and not be offended well if it was God doing it maybe it is you had to come down the flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and I'll raise him up in the last days see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from the attribute to but before the foundation of the world his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he became the word this talking about our Lord Jesus Christ the theophany and could appear and disappear and then he become Flash and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies right so the Tabernacles there amen or you understand what the prophet's saying but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah he that's born of God does not commit sin look at the transition God is bringing in US amen he who is in Christ my brother and sister that sin hath no part it cannot be laid to his account and you realize this is what's happening it's there well we believe but my brother and sister there's a level of receiving this that causes us to change our Outlook it changes how we see things amen and so he's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8 1. now I want to tell you my brother and sister how many of us I want you to be self introspect to yourself how many of us when we do or say something wrong stop and say I didn't do it in the first place we talk about it but when Satan can come and shoot that little Dart of condemnation and you still feel that Dart of condemnation you don't have a full revelation of that right there amen oh God I want that Revelation I want that Revelation to be able to live and when I make a mistake stand up and say Lord I for ask me Lord please forgive me I ask you forgive me Lord and just walk off without one second thought about that you say boy that sounds pretty that sounds pretty far out there brother Paul it's the word it's a word it's a life amen it's what's down in that Soul when you know that you know that you know that you are a son or daughter of God and there's nothing going to draw you away from him I'm not too far off in left field for you am I Hallelujah because I didn't bring them but boy I can sure produce a whole lot more amen so look at this you don't have to say if all I could just quit drinking if I could just get in Christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live the right kind of life like you women Amen brother Brown gets a little strong here like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost uh going out there and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that said Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed of word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question just what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started [Music] Hallelujah can you stand and not stand literal with me but can you stand with me today amen I've already begun my Rapture Journey amen I'm already uh going through a body change why because the box is fully opened the open word in our hour fully opened it my brother and sister that we can stand here today anointed by the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost and walk in the presence of almighty God it's no longer religion it's life it's relationship not a religion oh some people will be like who are you to say we're already in the Rapture that's false Doctrine well I don't know this whole body is changing all I can say this whole body is changing and if it's changing and coming and being molded by the presence of almighty God my brother and sister something's happening because a natural course of life I've heard a minister one time bring it very simple he said all you have to do is go stand on the side of a mountain to see what human nature is okay the trees they fall down they don't go up the mountain they go down it rains hard or it snows and melts the dirt the Rocks don't go up the mountain they go down the valley gets flatter the mountains get lower the very nature of humanity amen it's easy to go down it's hard to go up you know we were in Israel now I hope you catch this point kind of the corner of my mind I just in Israel my brother and sister people there at Masada this might sound morbid but I don't know that I could stand on top of the cable car or hang underneath the cable car and feel the same way but I feel very secure in the cable car and there was people there Masada different group and the people were like I had no idea we had to get in something like this to go up to see Masada I'm not doing it now is that group right in front of us that they had to open the gate and work those people out the side and down the deal there and I understood with it how they felt and the man turned to his wife and said well we can still say we've been to Masada but can you no got right to the base of Masada got the brochure got a picture in front of the sign but that's not Masada we can be faithful be in the house of God but if the soul has never caught the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen can we say that we have it I know say that judgmental it's already started it was once again subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly amen now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's the earnest see what's happening my brother and sister I did you catch what the prophet just laid out right there you realize what's being stirred in you and I right now is the rapture amen people would say wait wait wait that's the catching away we are we've got been caught away from this world we've been caught away from the lusts of the Flesh and pride of life all we can stumble we can have troubles and the devil will tell you see you've never got it but my brother and sister that's the flesh man but God's not looking at the flesh man he's looking down in the soul and he says I know what I put in that Soul amen amen it's almost like oh I don't know this silly analogy to bring it out this way but my brother and sister we've got all that equipment at home there I've got a computer program and I can go in there and type into serial number I can go over into this part right here and click on it and it tells you exactly every nut and bolt that machine had when it came out of the factory and I'm telling you I know poor analogy but God doesn't even have to look you don't need a computer he can look at that and he can say I know what was in that Soul when it come from the foundation of the world I don't have to wonder I don't have to hope I know what was in that soul I put the seed Gene of life and the Sea Gene of life is there and it will bear fruit because I have never oh the devil thinks it's boasting but he say I've never lost a one that ought to calls us to lift a hand and say thank you Lord hallelujah Hallelujah oh my worst time call amen now look at this Joe believed that that's how he had lived it all those years he believed that get this now believing it and having a full revelation of it are not one and the same Lord give us a full revelation full revelation of who we are amen that when the Devil comes and says you know what you made these mistakes that life would be different if you hadn't done this this and this and you know you just ought to give up and we entertain thoughts like that but I'll tell you what my brother and sister that's not who we are no that's right the Lord allowed job to live an experience he didn't have a full Revelation though that's happening today experiencing hard things but he come to the place God dealing with him so Direct that he moves from this place that's almost woven to me he moves to this place that suddenly the Veil pulled from his eyes and he sees the whole picture and he realizes this whole time this whole time I've been pleasing God and I had my ups and downs I had on fire and chilly and I was this and that and the whole time though God was in complete control now what does job do stop and start to gripe at god well if you look at these going on from these scriptures onto the end of job you'll see that it is one almost continual discourse of God driving home to job the whole picture go study it I don't need to preach it to you just go study it just you can even just you know uh just read it about that fast and you'll see God is laying every aspect of everything job this is this this is this this is it this is this this this this this this this this this this and job is not contesting it job is now absorbing this and he's realizing this whole time when I thought oh I even got the Holy Ghost I had it now this is not taking away from the fact that we have to come to a filling or baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's not taking away but this is when we have come to that and Satan's coming like a pickpocket trying to take it back amen I don't like pickpockets amen see where he was see where he was going in essence it was the opening of the written and Unwritten word to job so it is today my brother and sister believe it the Lord has allowed you to be tested Can someone say amen amen I I just might be this might be personal forgive me but brother Moses you went through a lot of struggles the Hedge is open it's not your failure my brother the Hedge is open and God said I'll let my brother be tested I'll let him go and struggle and fight and have to press through these things it's not that he has failed it's I have confidence in him to give full access of Satan to the life and it will come and he will overcome I know that was kind of blunt forgive me brother but I say that to encourage you Amen in these struggles that we have it's not about the failure Satan focuses on failure God is here to tell you I have confidence in you you're my son you're my daughter and I have given everything you need is that not what the prophet of God said everything you need is to make the Rapture amen that's paraphrasing it but everything you need is already in you oh what's happening the box is being opened and when the box was open what God deposited on the inside is coming out oh Hallelujah oh it terrifies us if we really saw the whole picture I'm telling you we're we still are here caught in this realm right here you realize when God told the devil he had full access to your life we'd be there going God said don't worry about it don't worry about it it's already in the Box it's already down in your soul don't worry about it have confidence in me trust me follow me it's already in you oh Hallelujah amen sister Ruth if you'll come you see job comes down to the end of this brother Gideon put up Psalms 1. I wasn't gonna put it I didn't include it but I just want to share it real quick Psalms 1 amazing Psalms follows job and Psalm 1 follows job who's blessed where do we take our counsel where are we standing and where are we sitting amen I'm not going to walk in Satan's Council and I'm not going to stand in the the courtyard as it were with Satan's Witnesses I am not going to sit in the seat of the unbeliever do you realize saying said we set long enough people say well they I sat there long enough finally I caught the Revelation that the message is wrong no you sat there long enough to catch the spirit of the devil because the scripture is telling you not to sit with the seed of the scornful amen because we're just human we just talked about how glorious the word is in us but my brothers and sisters God still put it in a tabernacle of Flesh and this flesh is subject to influence and if you don't think so nah this is going to be a little scathing I'm sorry but if you don't think so you just go visit some Churches that are constantly having pyramid schemes go through them I said I'd never ever do anything with that brother but you know I might I mean there's guys getting rich on this thing here's my 500. and then it creates such an animosity in the house of God now imagine if I had pyramids schemed you and over and over I told you this was going to make you money gonna make you money easy money you all be rich never works the devil's only one getting rich on this Earth you better believe it my brother and sister it's the devil that's getting rich and then that same Spirit comes up here and says now believe the word believe me trust me impossible we're not going to walk in the Council of the ungodly we're not going to stand in the way of The Sinner and we're not going to sit with this scornful we are going to stand true on the word and we're going to believe the very word of God that showed us job's life and showed I could put it to you this way hopefully this doesn't come across shocking you know what happened to job he saw the opening of the seventh seal that's exactly right Christ himself that's what he saw all of this led him to an absolute personal relationship with God it was no longer religion it was relationship Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah one last comment do you know that the opening the true opening of the word reveals to us exactly Who We Are amen amen reading the Bible now I'm going to throw you guys one you guys ready to catch a curveball reading the Bible never ever calls me to want to go to church not really trying to trick you but just reading the Bible never caused me to go to church but when the spirit of the word Came Upon me something told me I need to be in the house of God not only is the word say so but I want to be it's my desire you know what uh maybe a little transparent but Wednesday night I did not feel good sister Jerry did not feel good and I had to admit this but I might have just put my jammies on and sit down in a chair but when I actually got back to the house sister Jerry's like yeah I don't feel good and I'm like yeah I don't either but I asked you this is Jerry I'm going to church anyhow you know what if it's covered what if you're sharing the flu what is what what is that no sir I'll tell you what we did we put our dress clothes on we come and we got blessed in the house of God Amen I didn't feel like it I'm sorry to admit that I didn't feel like it but as soon as Jerry said I want to go to church anyhow something inside of me said we should be in church we should be in church I need to go to church do you know by the time the service is over I felt just fine amen now you talk about that I mean I could have took some NyQuil and some NyQuil and some whatever kind of quill and whatever a couple aspirin and a you know and still not felt good yeah but I come in the house of God and the presence of God is here and all of a sudden something inside of

and then one day God just unlocks something then we see that and we don't know why we didn't see it before but now that we've saw it we cannot unsee isn't that beautiful otherwise Satan would become
