[23:58] Hallelujah isn't it wonderful to be part
[24:00] of the Bride of Jesus
[24:02] Christ amen everyone in the world today
[24:05] is looking for an identity and even all
[24:08] the psychologists and whatever else are
[24:11] saying we we're having a great identity
[24:14] crisis and people are trying to to find
[24:18] something that would make them happy and
[24:22] often times because Satan comes and
[24:25] muddies the water their choice to make
[24:27] them happy is is not a good choice cuz
[24:30] it's not a lasting happiness it's
[24:33] temporal but I thank the Lord today that
[24:36] we actually can come and get a hold of
[24:40] something in our life that will hold us
[24:42] amen and uh I thank God for that amen
[24:46] that we have something holding us I
[24:48] think maybe she's in the the basement at
[24:51] the moment but we want to um welcome

[25:10] time in Oklahoma I heard it was too
[25:13] wonderful actually and you're trying to
[25:15] buy a house uh but um you know we just
[25:18] want the Lord's will to be done right we
[25:21] want him to guide us if we were relying
[25:24] on man we would have to have just Reams
[25:27] and reams of paper and plan a wouldn't
[25:30] work plan B wouldn't work we just have
[25:32] to keep digging through it until somehow
[25:35] we found a
[25:36] compromise but when God's in control we
[25:39] trust him and we listen to him then we
[25:43] know all things work together for them
[25:46] that love the Lord amen I I just want to
[25:50] um also remind the young people if you
[25:54] would
[25:55] please um young people's this Friday
[25:58] here at the church 700 p.m. and uh to
[26:01] sound like the school master or

[26:09] [Music]
[26:11] right brother Caleb's just looking at me
[26:15] like what are you talking
[26:17] about okay here's the last and final
[26:20] warning we won't mention it again please
[26:22] it read at least the first 10 pages for
[26:27] you young people with such talent 10
[26:30] pages is probably 10 minutes if you
[26:34] could please do that amen looking
[26:36] forward to it actually communion is this
[26:39] next Sunday evening 5:00 p.m. amen
[26:42] looking forward to that I I um we want
[26:45] to remember uh brother Sergey brother
[26:48] vasile is already on the prayer list but
[26:50] I I was uh trying to text with with uh
[26:53] brother Sergey last night and he said
[26:56] brother Paul uh while I tried to call
[26:59] him and and he says um I'm in the middle
[27:01] of a huge snowstorm and I just can't so
[27:05] let's remember them amen it's not just a
[27:08] matter of steering a truck down the road
[27:11] but uh sometimes you have to deal with
[27:13] everything else and um so one last
[27:16] announcements that I want to make um by
[27:20] God's grace we have arranged all of our
[27:24] speakers for the events coming up so for
[27:27] the Youth banquet we have brother rap
[27:30] crook uh brother rap um lives there in
[27:34] the Lima uh area but attends uh literal
[27:38] Life Church and uh I just really enjoyed
[27:42] visiting with brother rap and we're
[27:44] we're looking forward to that and uh I
[27:47] hope brother rap wouldn't mind me
[27:49] sharing this but you know Sister
[27:51] Elizabeth um has you know sometimes she
[27:54] just suffer some some
[27:56] anxieties and when I talked to brother
[27:59] rap the other day he said the Lord has
[28:01] just totally delivered her from that
[28:06] he's it's like she's a whole new sister
[28:08] in Christ amen and so we want to
[28:10] continue to remember our sister in
[28:13] prayer amen because those things
[28:16] anxieties and stuff like that are very
[28:18] very difficult to deal with they they
[28:20] control people's lives and so we're
[28:23] looking forward to brother rap coming
[28:25] the Easter
[28:26] meetings uh and not all of you will know
[28:30] them but the Easter meetings brother
[28:32] Daniel kungu from Seattle area will be
[28:37] coming and ministering for us for the
[28:39] Easter meetings sister Rachel would know
[28:42] them he's been coming up to North Idaho
[28:44] and ministering um brother Trevor
[28:46] wouldn't because his him and sister
[28:48] Carrie skipped the fellowship at the
[28:52] wedding so they won't know in fact where
[28:55] is Sister Carrie she's with my dun right
[28:57] now
[29:01] kid she's not feeling well this okay boy
[29:03] you threw me right there I'm like
[29:06] what okay let's remember Sister Carrie
[29:09] in prayer amen I always find a source of
[29:13] of uh uh
[29:16] reinforcement um you know Sister Carrie
[29:19] you know just always right there just
[29:22] right on top of it and brother Trevor
[29:24] also I I mean I think they missed their
[29:26] calling I I I've seen them write a few
[29:29] books uh and uh and and that's good it's
[29:34] good because sometimes we just need that
[29:36] reminder and it's good to read through
[29:37] it isn't it brother Trevor Amen to be
[29:39] able to look back and say Yes amen so um
[29:45] uh the Easter meetings um Lord willing
[29:47] we haven't solidified this uh but a very
[29:51] good chance that it will be a Saturday
[29:54] evening a Sunday morning with a
[29:56] fellowship following
[29:58] and um I guess I should spill the beans
[30:01] I will not be here um we um have
[30:05] accepted an invitation to go to South
[30:08] Africa and uh speak a series of uh
[30:13] Easter meeting there uh several services
[30:17] and um we prayed about that just really
[30:19] felt like the Lord uh laid on our heart
[30:22] to go and um I can be honest with you
[30:25] that in my flesh uh I'm excited but I'm
[30:29] not um I know that uh it will be um a
[30:33] long time to travel and a little bit
[30:37] laborious in in all of the things that
[30:39] will be there but the Lord laid it on me
[30:41] so strong that within the first day
[30:43] after the invitation I actually knew
[30:45] what I was going to preach on and um
[30:48] then the Lord just kept reinforcing that
[30:50] so uh the brothers will be here in
[30:53] charge and then to put on top of that um
[30:59] coming not this Monday tomorrow but in a
[31:02] week Monday and sister Jerry and I will
[31:04] be in
[31:05] Florida uh it's it's work it's work uh
[31:10] we're we're not we're not going and and
[31:12] laying on the beach um uh but brother
[31:15] Danny steeman has us uh invited us
[31:19] sometime back and we'll be there for a
[31:22] Wednesday and uh Sunday services and uh
[31:26] so Brother David uh we'll be uh taking
[31:30] the I never confirmed this with him but
[31:35] well the Wednesday following is
[31:39] confirmed Wednesday before Sunday
[31:41] Wednesday following so sorry we're
[31:44] taking business here but anyway so and
[31:48] then Family Camp brother Barry coffee
[31:51] has confirmed and uh sister Becky I
[31:53] believe if I understand correctly will
[31:55] be coming with him and so it will be a
[31:58] good time they are a wonderful couple uh
[32:00] those of you that don't know them you'll
[32:02] have this opportunity to get to know
[32:04] them they are wonderful couple amen God
[32:07] bless you let's turn in our Bibles I
[32:10] want to speak to you this
[32:12] morning uh kind of a different title but
[32:15] it actually come out of the message and
[32:17] brother brandham put it uh uh in this
[32:22] fashion respect for What the Lord Has
[32:25] Done For You So we just
[32:28] you know want to have respect and you
[32:31] know sometimes we look at things and
[32:33] Define a word and we Define it in a such
[32:35] a way we think oh this is what respect
[32:37] means I look up to this person but
[32:41] there's many uh definitions and we will
[32:44] just um take a Hol of one today but
[32:47] respect for what God has done for you
[32:50] amen I just want to say if the Lord
[32:51] spoke it it's already
[32:55] done we in the humanity
[32:58] look into things and say well if this
[33:03] happens when this
[33:06] happens when the Lord spoke it it was
[33:10] already finished amen that should
[33:14] actually help our faith that should
[33:16] actually be something we anchor on
[33:19] because then when we look at this you
[33:22] know the scripture shows us very clear
[33:24] there's going to be a Rapture you know
[33:26] as far as I'm concerned the rapture has
[33:28] already taken place there's not a bit of
[33:30] anxiety not a bit of fear not a bit of
[33:33] question will I make it can I be part of
[33:35] that while I come short amen the word
[33:38] shows us that there's going to be a
[33:40] catching away and he also showed us that
[33:42] we were the ones that we're going to be
[33:44] caught away and so that should just give
[33:47] us confidence not anxiety and and we
[33:50] hold to that and and we'll we'll touch
[33:52] on a few things this morning amen so
[33:55] let's turn to Hebrews 11 1-4
[33:58] and uh if if it seems like this is just
[34:01] a little different uh scripture to use
[34:05] uh I want to just uh show you here in a
[34:07] minute or remind you uh this is what um
[34:11] brother brandham used as a foundational
[34:13] scripture in faith is a substance and so
[34:17] I just felt led to just draw this out
[34:20] amen Hebrews 11
[34:23] 1-4 now Faith is a substance of things
[34:26] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[34:30] Seen because you see once you have it in
[34:32] your hand as it were you don't need
[34:35] Faith anymore sub it's
[34:39] substance and so God is taking this and
[34:43] drawing now pardon me for using these
[34:45] words but God is drawing a
[34:48] concept saying this can be like this and
[34:51] this can be like this and this can be
[34:53] like this and then he's expecting or
[34:56] Desiring for you and I to believe that
[34:59] amen and when we reach out by God's
[35:02] grace and take a hold of that my brother
[35:04] and sister no longer
[35:07] concept
[35:09] reality and we as Sons and Daughters of
[35:12] God are in
[35:14] reality we are not in the abstract we're
[35:17] not in the hoped for we have moved into
[35:20] the realm of
[35:22] reality and I say that with confidence
[35:25] because it is Christ in you
[35:28] can we say Amen to that we we're not
[35:30] sitting here hoping someday we'll meet
[35:32] our Lord Jesus Christ we have met him
[35:35] amen now Faith is the substance of
[35:37] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[35:39] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[35:42] good report through faith we understand
[35:45] that the worlds were framed by the word
[35:47] of God so that things which are seen
[35:50] were not made of things which do appear
[35:54] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[35:56] excellent sacrifice and Cain by which he
[35:59] obtained witness that he was righteous
[36:02] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[36:06] being dead yet speaketh Heavenly Father
[36:10] we ask you to just bless the service
[36:11] today bless each brother each sister
[36:14] father and Lord those who are not here
[36:16] today by whatever uh situation sickness
[36:19] or circumstance Lord we would just ask
[36:22] you may your presence even at this
[36:24] moment come down upon them Father speak
[36:26] to their hearts Lord for father we want
[36:29] to obey the word when it said not to
[36:31] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[36:33] together but father we know that you are
[36:35] the author and finisher of our faith and
[36:38] you know every circumstance of our life
[36:40] and father you are in control so we
[36:43] commit this day Lord to you in the name
[36:46] of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[36:55] Saints now as we look through this
[36:58] very familiar scripture it is my brother
[37:01] and sister the fact that by the by faith
[37:05] the elders obtained a good report and so
[37:08] if this worked for the elders it'll work
[37:10] for you and I amen who has a good report
[37:13] today amen by God's grace we have a good
[37:17] report because this is the same faith
[37:19] that has been All Through the Ages come
[37:22] right down and just listening to the
[37:24] prophet Discerning lives and and and
[37:27] speaking to people and and you know it's
[37:30] so interesting that the Holy Spirit can
[37:32] in such a fashion now remember brother
[37:36] Branham is uh this was back East I
[37:38] believe in Georgia and um brother bram's
[37:41] there and he calls out a lady and and he
[37:44] says you are Mrs so and so and you live
[37:47] on such and such street and I would be
[37:49] able to quote that to you if I had a
[37:50] better memory cuz just having heard it
[37:53] and read it it's h i I'm just already
[37:55] faltering on that amen that's why we
[37:57] need it daily or at least Paul needs it
[37:59] daily just to keep the brain tuned up
[38:02] and and so there's a lady sitting in the
[38:04] crowd in the congregation and she says
[38:08] uhoh he missed that
[38:11] one and so as she's sitting there a
[38:13] little this is Satan my brother and
[38:15] sister coming down and saying I know
[38:17] better than that I know where she lives
[38:19] I've been to her house and he missed
[38:22] that one but what the lady didn't know
[38:24] is in the last couple days this sister
[38:27] had moved moved to a new house and so as
[38:30] she is sitting there and Satan now is
[38:32] trying to an anoint a a doubt or a
[38:36] question mark amen the holy spirit is
[38:39] Discerning not past tense that's right
[38:42] amen not not going and having to look
[38:45] back as it would be into the Yellow
[38:47] Pages to those of you are old enough to
[38:49] know what that is and and seeing you
[38:52] realize the phone book used to have
[38:53] addresses in it and so you know that
[38:56] kind of dates you but anyway um you know
[38:59] not the holy spirit's not going back
[39:01] going now where does she live the holy
[39:03] spirit's on time amen the holy spirit is
[39:06] right here at this moment absolutely on
[39:10] time in our lives amen and so as it is
[39:15] the lady by God's grace it it's revealed
[39:18] that yes her friend had moved yes in
[39:20] fact that was her address yes in fact
[39:23] that was her Affliction yes in fact that
[39:26] was the Holy Spirit yes in fact God
[39:29] healed her am and so we look how God is
[39:32] working in our lives and he he's doing
[39:35] this and my brother and sister uh as my
[39:38] title says today respect for What the
[39:40] Lord Has Done For You amen I don't use a
[39:44] generic title in a sense I want it to be
[39:47] specific what he's done for you and God
[39:50] being an on time God we can look back
[39:53] and say you know I I I just really was
[39:56] on fire for the Lord 5 years ago or or
[40:00] my family was just really serving God
[40:02] Faithfully you know 6 months ago God
[40:06] doesn't want you to have a historical
[40:08] relationship he wants a relationship
[40:11] that's current at this time right now
[40:14] amen as we said in church this morning
[40:17] God wants your relationship to be on
[40:21] time amen and so we look at this and we
[40:25] realize I don't want to say I've shared
[40:27] it here at the church been a time in my
[40:30] life that God has done things I still
[40:32] vividly you know certain things in your
[40:34] life that that are drilled or burned
[40:37] into your brain so you can relive it in
[40:40] detail and and I just give a glimpse of
[40:43] that the time in my life as a teenager
[40:45] backslid that uh sitting in a pickup
[40:47] perched on top of a ravine with one rock
[40:51] holding the pickup now my brother and
[40:53] sister I can go back to that experience
[40:56] where God allowed that one single Little
[41:00] Rock the size of a softball to stop a
[41:03] pickup from falling in a Ravine and I
[41:05] can go back to that and I can go back to
[41:07] that but I want something real today
[41:11] amen I want God to speak to me and touch
[41:14] my life today because you see that was
[41:17] many years ago I was 17 years old when
[41:20] that happened and that time I have been
[41:23] hot I have been cold I have been injured
[41:26] I have been emotionally injured I have
[41:30] been everything on the board in that
[41:32] years in that but I'm coming today
[41:35] knowing that I don't want to look back
[41:38] to that relationship but I want to stand
[41:40] here this morning and acknowledge that
[41:43] for what would that be let's just call
[41:45] it 40 years more than 40 years I've been
[41:48] married 40 years or some 40 some yes
[41:58] math don't matter when you're
[42:00] married that's
[42:02] right I might make a Doctrine out of
[42:06] that I forgot your birthday look we know
[42:10] you were
[42:14] born so you look at this my brother and
[42:17] sister that we can look at the Times the
[42:19] pace that God is doing and and we say
[42:22] thank you we want to be respectful to
[42:25] God to look back and say thank you Lord
[42:29] for everything you've done you've
[42:30] delivered me you've saved me you gave me
[42:33] the Holy Ghost you've healed my body but
[42:36] lord I can't live in the past I'm living
[42:39] in the present but I want to have
[42:41] respect for what you've done because I
[42:42] know that when I honor your word you
[42:45] honor me amen isn't that beautiful God
[42:49] says you know what if you'll just
[42:50] believe my word say Amen to my word then
[42:53] I will bless you and so what he's doing
[42:55] is encouraging us to believe the word to
[42:59] confess the word and when we believe the
[43:01] word and we confess the word then he
[43:03] turns around and says because you
[43:05] believe my word I'm going to bless you
[43:08] boy what a beautiful Circle to live in
[43:10] amen God dealing with us all the time a
[43:13] Perpetual blessing if we will
[43:16] perpetually obey believe and act on the
[43:19] word of
[43:20] God so as we look at this we we see now
[43:24] now don't misunderstand me as we look
[43:27] back through the Bible often times uh we
[43:30] will talk about Enoch we talk about all
[43:33] of these others and we see what God did
[43:36] with them and we create them into
[43:39] spiritual Giants that we never believe
[43:42] we can live at that level but you
[43:44] realize my brother and sister if Enoch
[43:46] was placed here today and he looked you
[43:49] in the face and said hey what you need
[43:52] is a little encouragement let me tell
[43:54] you how I did it yeah
[43:58] we'd have our notebooks and our pin out
[44:00] we would be expecting to almost like
[44:01] write a book and Enoch would say I
[44:06] trusted God yeah right
[44:09] what that
[44:12] simple yes I trusted him and because I
[44:16] trusted him it unlocked in me the
[44:19] ability to confess and live out the word
[44:23] right but we'll have it as though Enoch
[44:25] was a super super spiritual guy then
[44:28] never faced a hardship never had a doubt
[44:30] or a fear or an anxiety never had issues
[44:34] with his children
[44:36] Etc but you see that's not what God's
[44:38] looking for he's not looking for perfect
[44:41] parents he's looking for people with
[44:43] perfect Faith amen a perfect trust in
[44:46] God that's what he's looking
[44:49] for now in the message faith is a
[44:53] substance brother brandham says here
[44:58] may God help us as I read some of the
[45:00] scriptures now over in the book of
[45:01] Hebrews 11th chapter we will begin and
[45:04] read the first three verses listen very
[45:06] closely because my words is just the
[45:09] words of a mortal they will fail but
[45:13] God's word will never fail it's always
[45:16] true and then we go on to the scripture
[45:19] of that now Faith is the substance of
[45:21] things hoped for the evidence of things
[45:23] not seen by for by it for by it the
[45:25] elders obtained a good report through
[45:28] faith we understand that the worlds were
[45:30] framed by the word of God now look my
[45:33] brother and sister as I just spoke to
[45:35] you uh I don't know exactly don't
[45:38] remember when I spoke these words but
[45:40] you see my brother and sister God before
[45:42] the foundation of the world he didn't
[45:44] just say Okay a lamb is slain and your
[45:47] name's on a
[45:48] book my brother and sister he birthed us
[45:52] amen right and it like any birth
[45:57] water and
[45:59] blood see we get an idea that there
[46:01] wasn't a sacrifice before there was a
[46:03] world but there was a sacrifice before
[46:06] there was a world and when that
[46:09] sacrifice was given and he cried out our
[46:12] names positionally placing us that we
[46:16] could come today and be positionally
[46:18] placed now those are not just
[46:20] catchphrase words my brother and sister
[46:22] that's as Supernatural as this Earth
[46:26] hanging in space perfectly on time that
[46:29] they can take and set time years in
[46:32] advance and look back in time perfectly
[46:35] that's how perfect our God is and so our
[46:38] timing of being placed in the Lamb's
[46:40] Book of Life is just as perfect as what
[46:43] they call I think the atomic clock and
[46:46] so it's there that God knew exactly
[46:48] where he would place you and I and by
[46:50] faith my brother and sister God placed
[46:53] you amen you say but does God need Faith
[46:56] no my brother and sister but he's the
[46:57] author of Faith so he had to have faith
[46:59] to author author it he is Faith amen
[47:03] that is God in you and I my brother and
[47:06] sister so God is Faith and so he is
[47:08] speaking That Into You and I today and
[47:12] he says by his word this is God speaking
[47:15] today that this is already in
[47:17] you you don't need to go roam through
[47:20] the deserts and search for Faith my
[47:21] brother and sister you need to believe
[47:23] that you are and when you believe that
[47:25] you are and a part of that perfect plan
[47:28] of God that you can then stand in the
[47:31] word with confidence now I I think that
[47:34] one of the things that's lacking in the
[47:36] world today in fact all the
[47:37] psychologists and all these mental
[47:39] whatever people are saying that there's
[47:41] actually less confidence in society
[47:44] today than there was like right after
[47:46] World War II in the 40s into the early
[47:49] 50s people have less confidence today
[47:52] and so it's there my brother and sister
[47:54] uh isn't it wonderful that we can stand
[47:57] here today sit here today as Sons and
[47:59] Daughters of God with full
[48:04] confidence I am not the least worried
[48:06] about waking up tomorrow morning and
[48:09] finding out I displease God and he
[48:11] disowned me struck me from the will
[48:14] praise the Lord that's right we have
[48:16] full confidence he said I'll lead you
[48:17] and guide you into and these are my
[48:20] words that perfect
[48:24] place we we don't have to go along
[48:27] well what if what if what if talking to
[48:31] a brother doesn't live around here so
[48:32] don't try and overanalyze but I was
[48:35] talking to a brother here recently and
[48:37] uh he put out several what
[48:40] ifs well what if the war with Israel and
[48:44] and and Gaza all starts again okay what
[48:50] if what if Russia we wake up in the
[48:52] morning and the news says Russia has
[48:55] crossed the boundaries with such force
[48:57] and they're headed to the Middle East
[48:59] what if amen I'll tell you what it comes
[49:03] down to before that comes to its climax
[49:05] the prophet of God showed us by the word
[49:08] that the bride is in the house amen so
[49:11] what
[49:12] if amen if these things continues the
[49:16] wars and the rumors of wars what if but
[49:19] we can stop my brother and sister and
[49:21] this will be highly personalized you can
[49:23] just think about it for yourself amen if
[49:27] you cannot look back in your life and
[49:30] see the hand of God in your life then I
[49:33] encourage you to find a place and dig in
[49:36] deeper and pray through
[49:38] amen he's been with us from the
[49:40] beginning he said he would be with us in
[49:43] the end or the finish and in everything
[49:47] in
[49:49] between see some theologians have taken
[49:52] the idea that when Israel was crossing
[49:55] the Wilderness of sin
[49:57] that when he allowed them to go into the
[49:59] Wilderness for 40 years that God had
[50:01] forsaken
[50:07] them
[50:08] nope God did not forsake
[50:12] them they themselves chose that path
[50:16] right God did not choose that path for
[50:18] them right they chose that for
[50:21] themselves we sit here this morning and
[50:25] God by his infinite wisdom is giving you
[50:28] and I the opportunity to choose our path
[50:32] you say but we're
[50:33] predestinated ah predestination doesn't
[50:36] make your path either easy or
[50:40] hard you can make your path easy or hard
[50:45] so predestination my brother and sister
[50:47] is not us being
[50:50] captive God will bring you in whatever
[50:52] Circle he needs to bring you and bring
[50:54] you right back to your correct place
[50:57] will it be
[50:58] hard oh my brother and sister I made
[51:01] reference to this but a brother left
[51:04] serving God when he was I think 17 going
[51:07] on 18 years old and 50 years later he
[51:10] comes back to the Lord and people are so
[51:12] happy to see him back and finally he
[51:14] gets comfortable enough and somebody
[51:16] asks him about his testimony and he said
[51:18] I have just spent 50 years in
[51:24] misery that don't sound like something a
[51:27] man would choose for
[51:28] himself that doesn't sound like a
[51:31] perfect plan but let me just share this
[51:33] I'm I'm kind of semi plagiarizing this
[51:36] off of someone if you don't mind I won't
[51:38] name names so you don't have to but my
[51:40] brother and sister we look at Elijah and
[51:42] what God had called Elijah to do and God
[51:45] gave Elijah a mantle and as he is there
[51:49] with that mantle Supernatural mantal
[51:52] anointing that is there and God's time
[51:55] piece and God's plan is so perfect that
[51:57] he's bringing this forth and he says you
[51:59] know I'm going to come to the time that
[52:01] Elijah's ministry will be over and
[52:04] someone needs to be able to pick up this
[52:07] mantle and wear it and be able to carry
[52:10] the word forward and as they carry the
[52:13] word forward they will become my
[52:15] representation my voice on the earth my
[52:19] brother and sister do you realize that
[52:21] God bringing Elijah in the scene and
[52:24] Elisha coming along that it was years
[52:27] before Elisha was prepared to wear the
[52:31] mantle amen he didn't just come they
[52:33] didn't go across the brook he didn't go
[52:35] away in The Chariot and the mantle fall
[52:38] on Elisha and there it was my brother
[52:40] and sister God trained Elisha he took
[52:43] him through many trials many things he
[52:45] didn't understand down many Pathways and
[52:48] in the end when the mantle fell and it
[52:51] fell on Elisha he didn't have to say I
[52:54] guess I'll have to go to the tailor
[52:57] that mantle was perfect now did God
[52:59] change the mantle or did he change
[53:02] Elisha now I'm telling you my brother
[53:04] and sister the word of God has come and
[53:06] and this will be another subject for us
[53:08] to go off into someday Lord willing but
[53:10] my brother and sister when the prophet
[53:12] went off the scene we have scriptural
[53:14] type that the mantle was going to fall
[53:17] on another people who would become the
[53:19] final voice in a final age and as she
[53:22] was to become that voice did he just
[53:24] throw the mantle out there and say let
[53:26] them make the mantle fit themselves no
[53:29] my brother and sister we are still being
[53:32] molded by the Lord that that mantle will
[53:35] fit on you and I and the Holy Ghost you
[53:37] say but I'm going through these
[53:39] struggles and I thought the Lord was
[53:40] going to make the way smooth before me
[53:43] he has you have no idea what it was
[53:46] before he started smoothing it out but
[53:48] he's taking you and I and he's molding
[53:51] you and I that the mantle of the word
[53:53] you'll find it in the message if you
[53:55] search it out the mantle of the word
[53:57] coming down the prophet of God says we
[53:59] don't change the word to fit us we
[54:01] change ourself to fit the word and so
[54:05] God is doing that can someone say Amen
[54:07] this morning God is doing that we are
[54:10] being changed and I think we need to
[54:12] have respect the what God is doing in
[54:15] our life we didn't just come and believe
[54:18] a message that's right God said you are
[54:21] the message and I'm going to mold you
[54:24] that when the mantle Falls on you and
[54:27] the Holy Spirit starts to deal with you
[54:30] that you will be a perfect
[54:32] representation of my word yes amen I
[54:35] tell you I don't feel like a perfect
[54:37] representation this morning my brother
[54:39] and sister but God's word says he's
[54:41] making us perfect or we are perfect in
[54:44] his side Can someone say thank you Lord
[54:47] amen because we're not going to go out
[54:49] here and recraft right the
[54:53] mantle restructure the mantle
[54:57] I want it to be longer I want it to be
[54:58] shorter I want the sleeves to be hanging
[55:01] over my fingers I want the sleeves to be
[55:02] 3/4 I want the sleeves above my elbows I
[55:05] want it this way I want it that way I
[55:07] want this I want that but my brother and
[55:09] sister sorry to put a negative
[55:11] connotation out here but around the
[55:13] world today we see people who are
[55:16] crafting the message to fit them amen
[55:19] and that's not what God called for God
[55:21] said I want you to be molded perfectly
[55:24] to my mantle and when the mantle Falls
[55:27] and it fits you perfectly you can take
[55:29] that mantle because the power of God
[55:32] rested with Elisha in the mantle it was
[55:35] not Elisha he didn't walk out of there
[55:37] saying praise God I'm powerful he walked
[55:40] out of there knowing that that mantle
[55:43] had come and fallen and the Holy Ghost
[55:45] has fallen on you and I today that the
[55:48] power of the word is crafting you and I
[55:51] into that perfect image of Jesus Christ
[55:54] amen we're not here to turn the message
[55:57] into what we think it should be but the
[56:00] message is here by God's grace to craft
[56:02] us or mold us into what God desired for
[56:05] us to
[56:07] be but the scripture warns us that they
[56:10] would be those
[56:13] people who saying the Lord told
[56:17] me well my brother and sister the Lord
[56:21] told
[56:23] me I'm not required to live your re
[56:26] ration you're not required to live my
[56:28] Revelation but there is only one
[56:30] Revelation amen it's not the revelations
[56:33] of Jesus Christ it's the Revelation
[56:37] right in correct English is
[56:41] singular so we look at this amen where
[56:44] was
[56:45] I we'll just start right here for by the
[56:48] elders obtained a good report through
[56:50] faith we understand that the worlds were
[56:51] framed by the word of God so that things
[56:54] which are seen were made of things which
[56:57] do appear by faith Abel offered to God a
[57:01] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[57:03] which he obtained a
[57:06] witness what a price to pay to be a
[57:11] witness God didn't just say you know
[57:13] what Abel I'm going to make you a
[57:14] witness just sit down and enjoy
[57:17] yourself here's your here's your
[57:20] drink sit down here under the umbrella
[57:27] Stir It with your little Twizzler stick
[57:29] or whatever they call those and and just
[57:31] enjoy
[57:32] yourself God said you know what Abel I'm
[57:35] going to make you such a
[57:39] representation but it's going to take
[57:41] your
[57:42] blood just as it took my blood before
[57:44] the foundation of the world to seal this
[57:49] witness Who Wants To Be A Witness amen
[57:52] hallelujah amen my brother and sister no
[57:54] carnal flesh is going to say I want to
[57:56] be that kind of witness but I tell you
[57:58] that seed Gene of almighty God down
[58:00] inside you and I is Lord this is not my
[58:03] life never was my life and I don't own
[58:06] anything Lord my house my car everything
[58:09] I have in the bank whatever it might be
[58:11] it's yours Lord and this body is yours
[58:14] Lord and even the Revelation that is
[58:16] within me is yours
[58:19] Lord
[58:23] amen and being dead yet
[58:27] spake now brother Brown here you'll see
[58:29] in the
[58:31] quote um that it says something about
[58:34] the PA systems too loud and blank spot
[58:36] on the tape I think that may be just a
[58:38] little better kind of causes a
[58:41] rebound imagine those things still
[58:46] happen now wish to take my text out of
[58:50] the third chap the third verse rather
[58:52] the last one of the last phases God
[58:56] testifying of his
[58:59] gifts do you realize my brother and
[59:01] sister that what is in you today is
[59:05] being testified of in the
[59:08] natural I get these kind of
[59:11] conversations and it makes me happy I
[59:13] don't take credit for them brothers will
[59:15] put it this way they say oh brother Paul
[59:17] that's such a lovely group of Believers
[59:19] there as I as though I had crafted you
[59:23] into being beautiful people
[59:27] but there is a natural witness
[59:29] amen known around the
[59:32] world that you are a wonderful group of
[59:35] Believers yeah praise the
[59:37] Lord ain't that
[59:39] incredible God
[59:42] testifying if he wrote another book of
[59:45] Acts my brother and sister the Saints of
[59:47] Grace would be listed in there as Paul
[59:50] speaks positively of those little groups
[59:52] and those people that he interacted with
[59:54] amen we would be in in there Can someone
[59:57] say thank you Lord hallelujah and and
[1:00:00] we're looking here saying but we have
[1:00:02] struggles we have this we have that it
[1:00:04] doesn't matter what you think you have
[1:00:06] what did God say you have amen and God
[1:00:10] has given you this report that is shared
[1:00:13] Around The World God has given you this
[1:00:16] blessing it is not what we did not what
[1:00:18] we can do not anything special about us
[1:00:21] but God having giving this good report
[1:00:24] and as it comes down my brother and
[1:00:26] sister God working is using you as a
[1:00:29] witness amen that God is powerful God is
[1:00:33] faithful God has Saints on this side and
[1:00:36] that side and far north and far south my
[1:00:39] brother and sister he's got a body of
[1:00:41] believer Every Nation every Kindred
[1:00:43] every tongue and this is God testifying
[1:00:46] of what he's done for you amen amen
[1:00:48] God's not needing to testify that I can
[1:00:51] do this God knows he can do that and
[1:00:53] anyone that has a seed of faith in him
[1:00:56] knows God can do that but God's wanting
[1:00:58] you to know that the work he's doing in
[1:01:01] your life even if you don't see it he's
[1:01:04] showing you off as a testimony
[1:01:06] hallelujah oh my brother and sister
[1:01:09] maybe we ought to think on those things
[1:01:12] Amen to be reminded oh sounds boastful
[1:01:14] brother Paul I'm not talking about human
[1:01:16] element Saints I'm talking about the
[1:01:18] power of what God has done for you and I
[1:01:22] what he changed us from and I think you
[1:01:24] need to respect that test testimony you
[1:01:27] don't need to sit back and say oh we
[1:01:29] just be so humble we'll be this but we
[1:01:31] don't need to be boasters unless we're
[1:01:33] boasting on Jesus Christ but I'll tell
[1:01:35] you what God has done for us we need to
[1:01:39] respect that we need to say yes God's
[1:01:42] healed me yes God delivered me yes I had
[1:01:45] doubts yes I had fears yes this was upon
[1:01:48] me the Philistines are upon me but God
[1:01:51] has delivered me and I'm no longer
[1:01:54] subject to the fear of a
[1:01:56] Philistine amen because this is what God
[1:01:59] is doing in our life and as long as we
[1:02:01] downplay it as though oh that couldn't
[1:02:03] be for me that couldn't be for me then
[1:02:05] it won't be for you cuz whether you say
[1:02:08] you will or you say you won't you're
[1:02:11] right either way and I say today thank
[1:02:13] you that God has marked you and I as the
[1:02:17] bride of Christ has anointed us with his
[1:02:19] word poured His blessings out upon us oh
[1:02:22] do we have struggles oh do we have
[1:02:25] trials can you wait till you get the
[1:02:27] other side and sit down and talk to job
[1:02:29] and start to tell job about your
[1:02:32] woes come on my brother and sister amen
[1:02:36] job's going to say hey just a second
[1:02:38] brother I love you so much sister I love
[1:02:40] you so much but how how long did you lay
[1:02:43] there and scrape the
[1:02:45] boils I never
[1:02:48] have and then you'll start sharing your
[1:02:51] testimony of the greatest battle ever
[1:02:53] fought and job would say I never
[1:02:56] realized yeah but you're here you
[1:03:00] overcome it was the grace of God Amen he
[1:03:04] did it for me one day I caught a
[1:03:05] revelation that it was already settled
[1:03:08] that when he our lord Jesus stood there
[1:03:10] at Calvary and said it is finished I
[1:03:12] caught a revelation one day that every
[1:03:15] woe that I have right now everything
[1:03:17] that you are battling in your mind this
[1:03:19] morning are you with me Saints
[1:03:21] everything that's a thought that come
[1:03:23] dragging to church in your mind today
[1:03:26] has already been defeated by the word of
[1:03:29] God he said the victory is already been
[1:03:32] won we should respect what God has done
[1:03:35] and believe him and stand up and say it
[1:03:39] is already done it's finished amen
[1:03:47] hallelujah God testifying of his gifts I
[1:03:51] believe each one of us sitting here
[1:03:52] young and old if we could really really
[1:03:54] focus
[1:03:56] we would
[1:03:57] realize what God has truly done for us
[1:04:01] amen I don't care if you're 10 years
[1:04:04] old
[1:04:07] or older than
[1:04:14] me 10 or
[1:04:16] 73
[1:04:17] whatever maybe we go younger than 10
[1:04:21] even some of these children have such a
[1:04:23] grasp God has been so good to them he's
[1:04:25] pour His word into them from babes and
[1:04:28] they understand way more than we give
[1:04:30] them credit for so it doesn't matter
[1:04:33] what that age is my brother and sister
[1:04:34] what matters is how we view the mantle
[1:04:38] amen are we waiting for someone greater
[1:04:41] to come that the mantle might fit no sir
[1:04:44] no sir God is forming you and I as Sons
[1:04:47] and Daughters of God that as that mantle
[1:04:51] comes I've seen a little short
[1:04:54] video it was kind of funny the other day
[1:04:58] actually the wife comes home and tells
[1:05:01] the husband I bought you some clothes at
[1:05:03] the thrift
[1:05:06] store she says I think they'll
[1:05:09] fit and I thought this could be
[1:05:12] something that sister Jerry and I
[1:05:16] wrote I put a shirt on the other day
[1:05:18] I'll skip that other whole story you'll
[1:05:20] get it when I share this with you I put
[1:05:21] a shirt on the other day and I said
[1:05:24] Jerry come here here and she comes
[1:05:26] walking in the bedroom what and I've got
[1:05:29] this shirt on and
[1:05:32] I I don't think it
[1:05:38] fits now I'm not I'm not dinging on
[1:05:41] sister
[1:05:42] Jerry but you see my brother and sister
[1:05:45] that
[1:05:46] mantle we're not going to have to pull
[1:05:49] our tummy in and twist a shoulder and
[1:05:53] try and get that mantle on and neither
[1:05:56] is that mantle going to be hanging past
[1:05:58] our fingers and dragging on the ground
[1:06:01] with shoulders that they all and we're
[1:06:04] dragging it
[1:06:06] along that
[1:06:07] mantle Christ in you amen is a perfect
[1:06:12] fit amen amen amen God made it just for
[1:06:17] you that's right oh he uses a what we
[1:06:20] might pardon me for using it this way he
[1:06:22] he used it in a generic term the bride
[1:06:25] of Christ but my brother and sister that
[1:06:27] Holy Ghost tailor has tailored this word
[1:06:31] right down so perfect that we realize
[1:06:34] who we are now I'm talking natural
[1:06:36] spiritual so bear with me who we are it
[1:06:39] is a perfect fit God tailored the word
[1:06:42] for you amen amen when the word is
[1:06:45] preached about someone who who has had
[1:06:47] many
[1:06:48] husbands and you only had one or not
[1:06:51] even married you don't have to say how
[1:06:53] do I make that fit my life that was
[1:06:55] wasn't tailored for you amen and maybe
[1:06:58] you were a drug addict and the word is
[1:07:00] preached and it comes and it breaks an
[1:07:02] addiction that was tailored for you and
[1:07:05] we need to stop and quit rushing through
[1:07:08] life we need to stop and say thank you
[1:07:11] Lord thank you Lord as I look back in my
[1:07:14] life thank you Lord because you knew
[1:07:17] what it would take to get Beyond this
[1:07:22] day have you ever tried to live in the
[1:07:24] future
[1:07:28] I've
[1:07:29] tried I've tried every year sister Jerry
[1:07:32] and I pardon me for using this as an
[1:07:36] example every year sister Jerry and I
[1:07:38] it's already done for us it's already
[1:07:40] we've already predicted our financial
[1:07:44] future for the next
[1:07:47] year sounds like lunacy doesn't
[1:07:52] it but our Banker says I I want to see
[1:07:54] your pi
[1:07:56] picture please bear with me the banker
[1:07:59] says I want to see your picture as you
[1:08:02] see
[1:08:03] it for the coming
[1:08:06] year when we sit down and with our best
[1:08:09] knowledge we're going to burn this much
[1:08:12] fuel we've spent this much on repairs
[1:08:14] we've done this we've done that and we
[1:08:17] put all of that together and you'll find
[1:08:19] it shocking that then when we go over to
[1:08:21] the income side and we're growing this
[1:08:23] crop and it's worth this and we do this
[1:08:24] and these numbers don't add
[1:08:28] up we don't go to the banker and say
[1:08:31] well I don't know it shows that we spent
[1:08:34] you know 250,000 more than we made but
[1:08:37] you can fix it right the banker is's
[1:08:38] going to say you fix it
[1:08:42] yeah so what happens the years come and
[1:08:46] the years
[1:08:47] go and you start to grasp I'm talking
[1:08:50] natural you start to
[1:08:53] grasp you know what these crops are are
[1:08:57] cheap we're going to have to tighten
[1:09:01] this
[1:09:02] belt tighter than we've ever tightened
[1:09:06] it
[1:09:08] before and you come up with a document
[1:09:10] and you go lay it on the Banker's
[1:09:14] desk weeks go by finally one day your
[1:09:18] loan docks are ready they don't call you
[1:09:21] and say you've been accepted in the

[1:09:54] losers or
[1:09:56] winners amen are we going to be blessed
[1:09:59] or feel like God has abandoned us are
[1:10:02] are we going to be Overcomers or are we
[1:10:04] going to just let Leo DEA beat us up do
[1:10:07] you know that your spiritual budget is
[1:10:09] what you write it to be amen there's no
[1:10:13] as it were profit or loss if you ride in
[1:10:15] there and say you know what I don't know
[1:10:17] if next year is as hard as last year I
[1:10:20] don't know if I can hold on my brother
[1:10:22] and sister you will get exactly what you
[1:10:25] wrote in your budget amen you will get
[1:10:28] that unless God intervenes but what God
[1:10:31] wants you to do is look through the word
[1:10:34] and say Lord you was with me in 2000 you
[1:10:38] were with me in 2005 you were with me in
[1:10:42] 2010 you were with me when we were sick

[1:10:56] the answer to my question amen but if
[1:11:00] we're over saying I think God abandoned
[1:11:02] us I don't know if the message is true
[1:11:05] because brother so so I looked up to him
[1:11:07] for so many years and he quit so I'm
[1:11:10] wondering if the message is true I'm
[1:11:11] sorry he wrote his budget why don't you
[1:11:14] write your budget why don't you write
[1:11:17] God's plan for your life and stand upon
[1:11:20] it when I'm not talking about writing
[1:11:22] another Bible I'm not talking about
[1:11:24] writing another message message I'm
[1:11:25] talking about what you're going to write
[1:11:27] in your brain and in your heart and when
[1:11:30] you write the word the word has never
[1:11:33] failed amen we can look back and we have
[1:11:36] ample evidence that the word has never
[1:11:39] failed and we can take that and go
[1:11:42] forward with that and say I'm going to
[1:11:44] be bold I'm going to walk out on this
[1:11:46] limb or this ice or whatever it would be
[1:11:49] I'm going to walk out there cuz my God
[1:11:50] has never failed me and he's not going
[1:11:53] to fail me today and I say thank you

[1:12:04] have Revelation and God's going to be
[1:12:06] with me everywhere I go and he's going
[1:12:09] to guide me amen my decisions won't be
[1:12:12] my decisions they'll be his decisions

[1:13:53] were early when the church was up by the
[1:13:55] post office out on
[1:13:57] GAR the devil used to throw that at me
[1:14:00] so what's it mean people are coming to

[1:14:24] a listed invitations he told me one time
[1:14:26] he said if I answered every one of these
[1:14:29] invitations he said I'd have to live to
[1:14:31] be 120 years
[1:14:35] old and he said I don't want to do
[1:14:38] that but he chose to deal with us or got
[1:14:41] followed What God did and you know it's

[1:15:28] you if you start to drift or
[1:15:32] something I believe the Lord would lead
[1:15:35] me or another brother to straighten you
[1:15:40] out made me more nervous than I was
[1:15:43] before but you see my brother and sister
[1:15:45] what happens is is God knows what needs
[1:15:47] to happen and he comes along and he
[1:15:49] starts to reinforce it and he starts to
[1:15:50] build it up and this is not men boosting
[1:15:53] men yeah this is God coming along and
[1:15:56] saying I'm going to prove to you who you
[1:15:59] are amen that's right we sit here this
[1:16:01] morning my brother and sister I don't
[1:16:03] want to sound boastful Brother David
[1:16:05] would have the same actually every one
[1:16:06] of you would have the same of the things
[1:16:08] that God's done to reinforce you to lead
[1:16:11] you to guide you to do all of this but
[1:16:13] at that point right there suddenly one
[1:16:15] day you wake up and you have a little
[1:16:17] bit more confidence and you realize
[1:16:19] truly God will correct you he'll wake
[1:16:21] you up in the middle of the night and
[1:16:22] say you didn't say that quite right
[1:16:25] right you didn't do that quite
[1:16:28] right but it's only when we become dull
[1:16:31] of hearing that God's not there to
[1:16:32] correct us we blame it on God but he was
[1:16:35] speaking we just weren't
[1:16:38] hearing okay most anybody can get a
[1:16:40] following no matter what they teach or
[1:16:42] think somebody will listen to them and
[1:16:44] it's a day that the prophet spoke of
[1:16:46] people when they're hungry they'll eat
[1:16:48] from anywhere if children and people are
[1:16:50] starving they'll eat from a garbage can
[1:16:52] that want eat from a nice table but if
[1:16:55] they are hungry they'll eat somewhere
[1:16:58] and I'm going to throw this out at you I
[1:17:00] hope it doesn't offend anybody but my
[1:17:02] brother and sister if you find yourself
[1:17:04] uh uh you are starting to dig into the
[1:17:06] world's movies and the world's music and
[1:17:09] the world's behaviors you're in a
[1:17:11] garbage
[1:17:12] can let's just face
[1:17:14] it this is not it's okay with God you
[1:17:19] have starved yourself to the place that
[1:17:21] you're eating out of a garbage can and
[1:17:24] in the strong illusion of the age you
[1:17:26] don't even realize you've climbed in the
[1:17:28] dumpster and that's where you're living
[1:17:31] Lord help us I say this in Love to You
[1:17:33] Saints amen let's just lift a hand lift
[1:17:36] our heart say Lord keep me from ever
[1:17:38] climbing in the dumpster I don't need to
[1:17:41] feed on the dumpster I have the bloody
[1:17:44] lamb I have the word I don't need a
[1:17:47] dumpster I don't need Le O deia other
[1:17:50] than it's here to mold your
[1:17:52] character and God proving the devil
[1:17:54] wrong but if you're hungry they'll eat
[1:17:56] somewhere so I think real true Ministers
[1:17:59] of the Gospel ought to be up and going
[1:18:01] ought to be giving the people the right
[1:18:03] things meet in due season pray for me
[1:18:07] pray for Brother David pray for the men
[1:18:09] that come and pass through this church
[1:18:12] amen because my brother and sister we're
[1:18:14] not here to give you garbage I've often
[1:18:17] said this and you mind if I had a heart
[1:18:19] attack tomorrow somebody will bring it
[1:18:20] up but I could care less what somebody
[1:18:22] else thinks but my brother and sister
[1:18:24] there was a time in my life I really
[1:18:25] really struggled and I I used to just
[1:18:28] say Lord if if I ever drift off the word
[1:18:31] father just let me die of a heart attack
[1:18:34] I'd rather be dead than preach something
[1:18:37] false amen I have no desire to be
[1:18:41] dead so I'll tell you I have no desire
[1:18:45] to be caught up in something false amen
[1:18:48] hallelujah boy at this rate we're going
[1:18:50] to be here all day so the prophet's
[1:18:53] talking about meet and due season
[1:18:55] look where the Lord's brought you
[1:18:58] from Hallelujah my family has roots
[1:19:01] going back my grandmother was born
[1:19:05] raised up in the LDS left it I don't
[1:19:09] know exactly what age but she left that
[1:19:12] the other side my father was raised in
[1:19:14] Catholicism God left them when they got
[1:19:17] married my parents they looked at each
[1:19:19] other and says we don't want to be any
[1:19:20] of this other stuff out here and they
[1:19:23] started searching and they search
[1:19:24] searched and they searched and it looked
[1:19:26] like they were Church
[1:19:28] Hoppers oh you know that's almost a
[1:19:32] curse word in the
[1:19:35] message Church
[1:19:38] Hopper they went over here they went
[1:19:41] over here they went over here went over
[1:19:43] here but God's promise is true and one
[1:19:46] day they found something satisfied that
[1:19:49] Soul oh my brother and
[1:19:52] sister forgive me for putting it this
[1:19:54] way but you know as the years went by
[1:19:57] and you start to see as a young man you
[1:20:00] know all the people Pentecostal oriented
[1:20:03] people that my parents went from here
[1:20:05] there and what people like jeie Platt
[1:20:07] bless her heart she had a lovely heart
[1:20:09] but you know they get to be 70 odd years
[1:20:11] old and they got 10 earrings in their
[1:20:14] ears and purple hair and they're
[1:20:16] dressing like they were
[1:20:18] 16 and and it's like what did this do
[1:20:22] and I've been there before when they
[1:20:24] would say to my
[1:20:26] mother wow this thing you believe sure
[1:20:30] has made you a dowy looking
[1:20:35] person well praise God my mother was a
[1:20:38] Dy looking
[1:20:40] person praise God my wife is a dowy
[1:20:44] looking person we're talking about their
[1:20:46] opinion amen oh some of you are smiling
[1:20:49] praise God you're Dy looking
[1:20:51] people because the bride of Christ was
[1:20:53] not called to the fashion of the age not
[1:20:56] called to look like the world not to
[1:20:58] dump into the dumpster and come out
[1:21:00] smelling and looking just like the rest
[1:21:02] of the world the bride was called out
[1:21:05] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:07] washed in the water of the word and
[1:21:09] she's not looking back to say our
[1:21:11] denomination says but she can look back
[1:21:14] you got that she can look back and say
[1:21:17] God came on the scene here and here and
[1:21:20] here and here and here and he will come
[1:21:23] on the scene here here and here and here
[1:21:26] for every need that I have amen I say
[1:21:30] thank you Lord I want to respect your
[1:21:32] word and the way I'm going to respect
[1:21:34] God's word is I'm going to live it amen
[1:21:37] I'm not going to talk about it I'm going
[1:21:38] to live it
[1:21:41] hallelujah we're eating at a king's
[1:21:43] table not a dumpster amen amen amen Le
[1:21:47] de seean
[1:21:48] garbage not a watered down version amen
[1:21:55] my I had no idea I had that much to
[1:21:57] preach
[1:22:01] here yeah let's go ahead let's go
[1:22:05] ahead faith is a
[1:22:09] substance paragraph 59
[1:22:20] yes see it's the substance of things is
[1:22:22] hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:22:24] you don't see it you don't taste it
[1:22:26] somebody said I don't feel any better
[1:22:29] well what's the matter why don't you
[1:22:30] feel any better if you have your faith
[1:22:33] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:22:35] is that
[1:22:39] right my that's
[1:22:42] right but I need something I can
[1:22:47] see well I have an answer for that I
[1:22:50] believe in being able to
[1:22:52] see you dive into the word deeper than
[1:22:55] you've ever dove in before and if you
[1:22:58] don't see a difference in your life I
[1:23:01] will stand on the street corner and
[1:23:03] apologize to
[1:23:04] you because you can't get into the word
[1:23:07] that's and not see a change you can't
[1:23:10] get into the word and not see God moving
[1:23:13] in your midst oh my one caveat on that
[1:23:17] offer is you have to give
[1:23:19] 100% effort that's right none of this
[1:23:23] well I I over breakfast
[1:23:28] and no
[1:23:31] no come on you want 100% give
[1:23:38] 100% no matter how you feel you're
[1:23:41] healed anyhow no matter what you see
[1:23:43] you're healed anyhow see what I mean
[1:23:47] it's you know it there's nothing can
[1:23:49] take it out of your heart you know it is
[1:23:52] just positive act right there oh my
[1:23:55] If You Could Only See It
[1:23:57] friends something would take place amen
[1:24:01] that's it right
[1:24:05] exactly people when it comes to
[1:24:07] different things that brother Brown
[1:24:10] preached they want you to show them in
[1:24:13] the
[1:24:16] scripture show me the
[1:24:19] seals show me show me show me you know I
[1:24:24] I must be inadequate cuz I can't show
[1:24:28] them but I have a quote where the
[1:24:30] prophet of God said it takes Revelation
[1:24:31] from God the Holy Spirit to reveal that
[1:24:35] can I reveal the Holy
[1:24:37] Spirit can I break open the book and say
[1:24:40] well I'm going to come and act like the
[1:24:42] Holy Spirit and show this to you but you
[1:24:44] see without them giving
[1:24:47] 100% they will never see it and so I got
[1:24:51] to keep going here
[1:24:55] the natural just as positive okay let me
[1:24:58] see it friends if you could only see it
[1:25:01] friends something would take place if
[1:25:02] you could only know what I'm talking
[1:25:04] about something would react right now
[1:25:07] see it's a positive it's right there
[1:25:09] just as positive as these other five
[1:25:12] senses these are of the natural man
[1:25:15] faith is of God so we'll never find
[1:25:19] faith if we're looking at it after the
[1:25:21] natural that's right it'll just never
[1:25:23] happen my brother and sisters let's get
[1:25:25] out of the boat let's get in the water
[1:25:27] amen let's get ourselves baptized not a
[1:25:30] baptism as into the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:25:33] that sense but baptized in the holy
[1:25:35] spirit so it completely covers us and
[1:25:38] we're Washed by the Water of the word
[1:25:41] and then you get 100% sincere brother
[1:25:44] brandom said God uses chaos how many of
[1:25:46] you like chaos oh my I don't think
[1:25:49] there'll be a hand
[1:25:51] lifted we don't like chaos but the
[1:25:53] prophet show mes God uses chaos because
[1:25:57] chaos brings
[1:25:58] desperation amen maybe we're not
[1:26:00] desperate enough we we're just living
[1:26:03] going through life we're finding we've
[1:26:04] got some music that we know we shouldn't
[1:26:07] and we're doing this and we know we
[1:26:09] shouldn't and we're doing that and we
[1:26:10] know we shouldn't and it's a little
[1:26:12] iniquity is all right it goes beyond
[1:26:14] iniquity my brother and sister it goes
[1:26:16] to the place that we're not desperate we
[1:26:19] want God to take us in a Rapture as
[1:26:22] though we were babies yeah in
[1:26:25] arms just come take me along
[1:26:28] Lord God wants you to show him you're
[1:26:31] serious help us all Lord yes amen amen I
[1:26:36] like this
[1:26:38] quote natural man faith is of God the
[1:26:41] natural man can be wrong but God cannot
[1:26:43] be wrong oh my why make us go to shout
[1:26:46] and think of it and the people tell me
[1:26:48] they got faith and say they can't
[1:26:50] believe in Divine Healing friends if you
[1:26:52] don't believe in Divine Healing you're
[1:26:54] lost amen H how you going to if you
[1:26:58] can't have faith enough for God to patch
[1:27:01] up this body to glorify him in how more
[1:27:04] are you going to have faith to believe
[1:27:06] that God will take this old Mortal and
[1:27:08] make immortality out of it to take it up
[1:27:13] we believe in a Rapture but we don't
[1:27:14] have enough faith for anything else I'm
[1:27:16] sorry we're fooling
[1:27:18] ourselves we're fooling
[1:27:20] ourselves when we come face to face with
[1:27:23] a rapture we realize we had no
[1:27:24] revelation of the Rapture because my
[1:27:26] brother and sister if you bear with me
[1:27:29] amen the Rapture is already taking
[1:27:34] place there's already a body change
[1:27:38] taking place amen and if the body ain't
[1:27:44] changing you're not in the
[1:27:48] Rapture right when we're floating
[1:27:50] through the air this is a vision most
[1:27:51] people have we're floating through the
[1:27:53] air
[1:27:55] God doesn't have a bunch of angels up
[1:27:56] there with a pressure
[1:27:58] washer cleaning you up before you get
[1:28:02] there you're ready to go amen when he
[1:28:05] calls you amen hallelujah
[1:28:10] am okay Paul has
[1:28:13] just had too big of a diet
[1:28:17] today amen but I want to finish
[1:28:20] this real
[1:28:22] quick so do you believe God's got enough
[1:28:25] to patch up this whole body
[1:28:28] Hallelujah not only that he's going to
[1:28:30] change every molecule of
[1:28:32] it how much more you going to have faith
[1:28:34] to believe God will take this old Mortal
[1:28:36] and make immortality out of it to take
[1:28:38] it up that's a direct Divine Healing oh
[1:28:41] my there's going to be some awful
[1:28:44] disappointments at the day of Judgment
[1:28:46] at the resurrection that's right faith
[1:28:49] we got to get such a place we'll be
[1:28:52] translated like Enoch was that's right
[1:28:54] faith and testimony that it pleased God
[1:28:57] did not Enoch our following scriptures
[1:29:00] said that Enoch had a testimony by faith
[1:29:03] that he pleased
[1:29:06] God can you imagine saints that God
[1:29:09] could so anoint you and I with a
[1:29:12] supernatural confidence that we could
[1:29:15] stand here this
[1:29:16] morning and say I have
[1:29:19] faults but I testify by the word I
[1:29:23] please God amen amen by the word yes sir
[1:29:27] I'm pleasing the Lord yes amen see when
[1:29:30] we get to that place right there Then
[1:29:31] You' Got Confidence enough to stand up
[1:29:33] and say there's nothing on this Earth
[1:29:35] going to detour me nothing on the Earth
[1:29:37] is going to keep me from the
[1:29:40] Rapture but I'm telling you not to sound
[1:29:42] negative but it's the truth and we need
[1:29:44] to just go ahead and speak truth I still
[1:29:45] deal with people that are just not sure
[1:29:49] they're even
[1:29:50] close not sure that they even have
[1:29:53] enough faith for a
[1:29:55] Rapture they for sure don't have enough
[1:29:57] faith for
[1:30:01] healing and yet some of them and pardon
[1:30:04] me for saying this I don't want to
[1:30:06] offend no
[1:30:07] one they're believing brother brandom's
[1:30:09] going to come back and give that to them
[1:30:11] yeah that's right absolutely
[1:30:13] right is that what the word says no the
[1:30:16] word says that when I'm paraphrasing
[1:30:20] this when he has gone
[1:30:22] up the the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:30:26] fell upon you and I and if we have the
[1:30:31] Holy
[1:30:32] Spirit what more would it be that God
[1:30:36] could
[1:30:37] do we've got the very Life of Christ in
[1:30:43] us just like the prophet laid it out and
[1:30:46] said God healed you even if he came back
[1:30:50] what more could he do amen you're
[1:30:53] already already amen healed amen Lord
[1:30:56] help our thinking that's right Lord help
[1:30:59] us to quit looking at this message and
[1:31:01] and almost like it's just a
[1:31:04] story God was with you at your
[1:31:08] Wilderness of sin that's right he was
[1:31:10] with you when you crossed over Jordan
[1:31:13] he's with you you know you'd think when
[1:31:16] crossed over Jordan that the Philistines
[1:31:18] would have all just disappeared out of
[1:31:19] the picture like etes sketch have
[1:31:22] Philistines
[1:31:25] no
[1:31:26] Philistines didn't work that way they
[1:31:29] had to go defeat every Philistine but
[1:31:31] they actually had a promise I was just
[1:31:33] reading about achen the other day it's
[1:31:36] just almost a scary story Saints yeah
[1:31:39] God comes down and says okay there's sin
[1:31:41] in the camp tells Joshua you're going to
[1:31:43] draw
[1:31:45] Lots I was I don't know why I thought
[1:31:47] this when I I read that but I thought
[1:31:49] that's almost like
[1:31:50] gambling you know I mean you know that
[1:31:54] got to be divinely ordained of God that
[1:31:57] they went through Israel drawing lots
[1:32:00] and in this nope it's not them guys Drew
[1:32:04] Lots
[1:32:05] oh it's in this family here oh it's in
[1:32:09] this subp part of the family oh
[1:32:12] achen what's going
[1:32:15] on and achen
[1:32:17] confesses and had the unintended
[1:32:20] consequence of killing his family that
[1:32:23] day he never got up that morning and
[1:32:25] walked out and Saidi think I'll just
[1:32:26] kill my family today sounds
[1:32:29] good but anointed spirit bear with me of
[1:32:33] leoda crept in and achen went
[1:32:37] out
[1:32:39] and forgive me sisters if sounds
[1:32:43] pointed but some of those Babylonian
[1:32:47] garments are really
[1:32:49] sexy exactly I hope that didn't offend
[1:32:52] anyone
[1:32:54] but they're deaf
[1:32:57] yeah and God won't let it
[1:33:00] pass God didn't let it pass that's right
[1:33:03] what did ain's little girl have to do
[1:33:05] with this
[1:33:09] equation but you see achen had already
[1:33:12] planted the seed in his own home and it
[1:33:15] had come down and affected his whole
[1:33:18] family oh Lord help us amen sister via
