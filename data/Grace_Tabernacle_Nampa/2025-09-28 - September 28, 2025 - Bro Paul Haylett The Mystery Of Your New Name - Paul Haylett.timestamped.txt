[14:25] Victory in Jesus.
[14:27] [Music]
[14:32] I heard an old old story.
[14:37] How a savior came from glory.
[14:41] How he gave his life on Calvary
[14:46] to save a wretch like me.
[14:51] I heard about his groaning
[14:55] of his precious blood
[14:58] atoning.
[15:00] Then I repented of my sin and won the
[15:06] victory.
[15:09] Oh victory
[15:11] in Jesus
[15:14] my savior
[15:16] forever.
[15:18] He sought me and he bought me with his
[15:24] redeeming blood.
[15:27] He loved me and I knew him. And all my
[15:33] love is to him. He plunged me to victory
[15:41] beneath the cleansing flood.
[15:46] I heard about his healing
[15:50] of his cleansing power revealing
[15:55] how he made the lame to walk again. And
[16:00] he caused the blind to see.
[16:04] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[16:08] come and heal my broken
[16:11] spirit."
[16:13] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[16:19] the victory.
[16:22] Oh victory
[16:24] in Jesus
[16:27] my savior
[16:29] forever.
[16:31] He sought me and he bought me with his
[16:37] redeeming blood.
[16:40] He loved me as I knew him.
[16:45] And all my love is to him. He plunged me
[16:51] to victory
[16:54] beneath the cleansing flood.
[16:58] I heard about a mansion
[17:02] he has built for me in glory.
[17:07] And I heard about the streets of gold
[17:12] beyond the crystal sea
[17:16] and about the angels
[17:19] singing
[17:21] and the old redemption
[17:23] story.
[17:25] And some sweet day I'll sing up there a
[17:30] song of victory.
[17:34] Oh, victory
[17:36] in Jesus
[17:38] [Music]
[17:41] &gt;&gt; forever.
[17:43] He sought me and he bought me with his
[17:49] redeeming blood.
[17:52] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[17:57] love is to him. He plunged me to victory
[18:05] beneath the cleansing flood. One more
[18:08] time. Oh, victory
[18:12] in Jesus,
[18:14] my savior
[18:16] forever.
[18:19] He sought me and he bought me with his
[18:24] redeeming blood.
[18:27] He loved me where I knew him and all my
[18:33] love is due him. He plunged me to
[18:39] victory
[18:41] beneath the cleansing flow.
[18:48] Amen.
[18:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:53] Amen.
[18:55] Number 993. Something keeps holding me.
[19:01] [Music]
[19:07] It says, "Resist the devil and he'll
[19:09] flee from you." Right? That's what the
[19:11] word says. Anybody ever
[19:15] something something in your head, you
[19:18] know, whatever the world, whatever it
[19:20] is, but doesn't matter.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Doesn't matter when you say I
[19:25] reject that.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:32] The child of this world was getting
[19:38] closer.
[19:43] But I felt was more than I could bear.
[19:54] And I was on the verge
[19:58] of giving over.
[20:05] The strength within myself just wasn't
[20:10] there.
[20:14] Then keeps holding me.
[20:20] Every day I see
[20:26] helping me faithfully
[20:29] to overcome
[20:31] my trial,
[20:36] guiding me constantly,
[20:41] giving me victory.
[20:46] He's a reality.
[20:48] [Music]
[20:50] Something keeps holding
[20:52] me.
[20:58] Satan laid before me
[21:02] his temptation
[21:08] of his desire to steal away my faith.
[21:18] But I have found inside
[21:22] the revelation,
[21:27] the strength I need to keep me in his
[21:34] grave.
[21:38] and keeps holding me.
[21:44] Every day I see
[21:49] helping me faithfully
[21:53] to overcome
[21:55] my trial.
[22:00] fighting me constantly,
[22:06] giving me victory.
[22:12] He's a reality.
[22:15] The something keeps holding me.
[22:23] The something keeps holding me.
[22:30] Every day I see
[22:34] helping me faithfully
[22:38] to overcome
[22:40] my trial,
[22:45] guiding me constantly,
[22:50] giving me victory.
[22:53] [Music]
[22:55] He's a reality.
[23:00] Something keeps holding
[23:02] me.

[42:26] He heals
[42:28] me now.
[42:31] He heals
[42:34] me now.
[42:37] Jesus
[42:40] heals
[42:41] me now.
[42:46] He's all
[42:49] I need.
[42:52] He's all
[42:55] I need.
[42:59] Jesus

[44:01] You're all
[44:04] I need.
[44:07] Jesus,
[44:09] you're all
[44:12] I need.
[44:17] Amen.
[44:19] [Music]
[44:20] Amen. As we ask our brother Paul to come
[44:23] number 1064,
[44:28] start with a chorus.
[44:33] Amen.
[44:35] Here
[44:40] we are
[44:44] lifting our hands to you.

[45:17] You are here
[45:22] dwelling within
[45:24] our praise
[45:29] for every answered prayer.
[45:33] [Music]
[45:35] for always being there.
[45:42] For love that hears us when we call.
[45:47] For arms that lift us when we fall.
[45:54] Oh, you you've been
[45:58] right beside us, leading us all along
[46:04] the way.
[46:07] And we made it through.
[46:14] Because of you,
[46:20] here we are
[46:24] lifting our hands to you.
[46:32] Here we are
[46:37] you thanks
[46:39] for all you do.
[46:42] [Music]
[46:45] as we praise
[46:49] and worship your holy name.
[46:57] You are here
[47:01] dwelling within
[47:04] our praise.
[47:09] For days we cannot see.
[47:15] For all that's yet to be
[47:21] the trials me have to face.
[47:27] and we'll be leaning on your grace.
[47:34] It will be your strength
[47:37] that saves us. Your love that makes us
[47:42] strong.
[47:46] And through it all,
[47:52] we'll sing this song.
[47:58] Here we are,
[48:02] lifting our hands to you.
[48:09] Here we are
[48:14] giving you thanks
[48:17] for all you do
[48:22] as we pray
[48:26] and worship your holy
[48:29] name.
[48:30] [Music]
[48:34] You are here
[48:38] dwelling within
[48:40] our praise.
[48:45] Here we are
[48:50] lifting our hands to you.
[48:58] Here we are.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Beautiful
[49:05] for all you do
[49:10] as we pray.
[49:15] Worship your holy name.
[49:18] [Music]
[49:22] You are here
[49:26] dwelling within
[49:29] our pray.
[49:32] Amen. Go to verse two,
[49:35] please.
[49:37] I would just like us just to ponder
[49:39] these words cuz this verse is almost
[49:42] like a sermon.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; The days you cannot see.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; We don't know the finish of today much
[49:49] less tomorrow.
[49:52] and the things that are yet to come.
[49:56] [Music]
[49:57] &gt;&gt; The trials
[50:00] we must face.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Could we lift our hands today and say,
[50:04] "Thank you, Lord, for the trials we're
[50:06] going to face."
[50:08] &gt;&gt; You see, we've already been given the
[50:09] word of God that says we're overcomers.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; These trials are not going to defeat us.
[50:16] It's time for us to just give God praise
[50:19] for no matter what tomorrow may be, no
[50:22] matter what we're facing today. What
[50:25] challenge it is, we belong to him. Amen.
[50:29] He's already spoken the word over us.
[50:33] It's time for us, including myself, I
[50:36] say for us to stop
[50:39] complaining about our circumstance and
[50:42] start declaring victory is already come.
[50:45] Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. For days we cannot see.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; For all that is to be
[50:59] the trials we may have to face.
[51:06] We'll be leaning on your grace.
[51:12] It will be your strength.
[51:15] that saves us.
[51:18] Your love makes us strong.
[51:24] And through it all,
[51:30] we'll sing this song.
[51:35] Here we are worshiping the saints uh
[51:40] lifting our hands to you.
[51:47] Oh, here we are
[51:52] giving you thanks
[51:55] for all you do.
[52:00] as we praise
[52:03] and worship your holy
[52:07] name.
[52:11] You are here
[52:16] dwelling within
[52:19] our praise.
[52:21] [Music]
[52:23] Hallelujah.
[52:25] Good to be in the house of the Lord this
[52:27] morning. Amen. We appreciate your
[52:30] prayers. Uh Sister Jerry and I had a
[52:33] very long laborious week, but by God's
[52:36] grace. Uh all is well. Good to be here
[52:40] in the house of God today. Felt very
[52:42] much as I wanted to finish the second
[52:45] part uh you might say of of last Sunday.
[52:49] And uh so I just want to speak to you
[52:52] this morning on the mystery of your new
[52:54] name. And I just I enjoyed the song
[52:57] service. Did you? I I just felt like it
[52:59] was good. God bless you musicians. Amen.
[53:02] Let's turn in our Bibles to Genesis the
[53:05] 32nd chapter verses 23-30.
[53:10] And uh as we'll look at this, we would
[53:14] uh just take a little bit out of uh uh
[53:18] what we had spoke as the opening of last
[53:20] week and uh lay a little foundation
[53:24] before we uh move forward here. Amen.
[53:34] Genesis 32:23-30.
[53:36] And he took them and sent them over the
[53:38] brook. This talking of Jacob, over the
[53:41] brook, and sent them uh over that he
[53:44] had, and Jacob was left alone, and there
[53:48] was wrestled, and there wrestled a man
[53:50] with him until the breaking of the day.
[53:52] And when he saw that he prevailed not
[53:54] against him, he touched him in the
[53:56] hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of
[53:59] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[54:01] wrestled with him. Now, my brother and
[54:04] sister, I want you to catch this. I'm
[54:06] sure you did last week, and I don't mean
[54:08] to be redundant, but even in this moment
[54:11] of personal
[54:14] affliction,
[54:17] do you know what that is?
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] That's not a,
[54:23] oh, I felt sad. That is a personal,
[54:26] deep, grievious, hurting, painful.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Do do we know what that means?
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Affliction.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't let go.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; My my brother and sister, we sometimes
[54:40] think it's all the devil that allows
[54:43] those things to happen. But God will
[54:44] allow sometimes deep grievous affliction
[54:48] to come upon us to see whether you will
[54:51] let go or
[54:52] &gt;&gt; you'll hold on.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And when he saw that he prevailed not
[54:57] against him, he touched the hollow of
[54:58] his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's
[55:00] thigh was out of joint as he wrestled
[55:02] with him. And he said, "Let me go, for
[55:04] the day breakth." And he said, "I will
[55:06] not let thee go except thou bless me."
[55:09] And he said unto him, "What is thy
[55:11] name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he
[55:14] said, "Thy name shall be called no more
[55:16] Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince, thou
[55:19] hast power with God and with men, and
[55:22] hast prevailed." And Jacob asked him,
[55:25] and said, Tell me, I pray thee thy name.
[55:27] And he said, Wherefore is it that thou
[55:30] dost ask after my name? And he blessed
[55:33] him there. And Jacob called the name of
[55:36] the place, for he had seen God face to
[55:39] face, and my life is preserved. Heavenly
[55:43] Father, we just come today, Lord. We
[55:46] come in your presence, asking you,
[55:47] Father, just to speak to hearts.
[55:50] Encourage us, strengthen us, give us
[55:51] something, Lord, to hold on to in this
[55:54] coming week, Father. For Lord, we know
[55:57] that the hour that we're living as the
[55:59] prophet of God laid out a foundation
[56:02] before us. And we see in the candlestick
[56:05] of the ages, Father, it is going into
[56:07] gross darkness once again. We talk of
[56:10] the dark ages. We talk of times when the
[56:13] revelation of the word was almost lost.
[56:15] But father, according to the word, we're
[56:18] coming back into a season. And Lord, I
[56:20] think today we should just give praise
[56:23] for it's in our worship that you dwell
[56:25] to give praise that the light is shining
[56:28] upon us today that we are not walking in
[56:31] gross darkness, but we have the light of
[56:33] the gospel revealed in this hour. Lord,
[56:36] it's not about religion. It's not about
[56:38] churches. It's not about other names.
[56:40] Father, there's only one name that
[56:42] matters. And Father, we come today just
[56:44] by your grace and mercy. We will express
[56:47] this. And we just ask, Father, that you
[56:49] would help us in the name of Jesus
[56:51] Christ. Uh bless each life in your name.
[56:54] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Now,
[56:58] we'll see that the principle of giving a
[57:00] new name is established in scripture.
[57:04] And uh it it goes much deeper than just
[57:06] this example. But we take this here that
[57:10] God placed upon that and chased Jacob
[57:13] from being a surliner or a deceiver and
[57:16] gave him the name of Israel and how that
[57:19] in that God brought it this moment of
[57:22] his life. Now, this was not a moment as
[57:26] it would be that that Jacob had thought
[57:28] would be coming, but yet there was
[57:30] something in him that was yearning for
[57:32] this. And he was there in a time of
[57:35] great distress uh meeting his brother
[57:38] Esau again coming together uh wondering
[57:41] exactly what is uh upon Esau's heart.
[57:45] Esau, the the news came that Esau was
[57:48] coming with 400 of his men. And that
[57:50] sure sounds like war. and and Jacob was
[57:53] in distress. He had a wife. He had a
[57:55] family. Had possession. And and it
[57:57] looked like he was going to lose all of
[57:59] that. And he got serious with God. And I
[58:02] think God will allow you and I to come
[58:05] into positions in our lives that we have
[58:08] to get serious with God. It might not
[58:11] happen today. It might not have been
[58:13] yesterday. It might have already passed.
[58:15] But Lord will come. The Lord will come
[58:19] and put you in a position you will seek
[58:21] him. Amen. This is not about maybe you
[58:25] will, but if you're a son or daughter of
[58:27] God, you will. It's just that simple.
[58:29] So, it is there the Lord establishing
[58:33] this new name in the word for Jacob
[58:36] where he is now called Israel. Now, as
[58:39] we'll look in a minute uh here, but
[58:42] Isaiah speaks and prophesies. You love
[58:44] the book of Isaiah. So many good nuggets
[58:47] hiding in the book of Isaiah. And so he
[58:50] is here in Isaiah 62. He's uh
[58:54] prophesying or speaking over Jerusalem
[58:57] and over Israel and over you and I. And
[59:00] so this is not just a scripture that uh
[59:04] pertains to days gone by, but it is
[59:07] there that he says, "For Zion's sake
[59:10] will I not hold my peace." Amen. Please
[59:12] change that, Brother Alex. And for
[59:14] Zion's sake will I not hold my peace.
[59:17] And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[59:20] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[59:22] as brightness and the salvation there as
[59:25] a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles
[59:28] shall see thy righteousness and all
[59:31] kings the glory. And thou shalt be
[59:32] called by a new name which the mouth of
[59:36] the Lord shall name. So it's not a new
[59:38] name that man gives to it. My brother
[59:41] and sister. We see all through this
[59:42] scripture. We'll touch on it a little
[59:44] bit. Uh but the new Jerusalem, amen, we
[59:47] have ideas. There's been artist
[59:49] depictions of a new city coming down
[59:52] from the heavens to the earth. But my
[59:54] brother and sister, I'm telling you that
[59:56] we have to see the whole picture to
[59:59] catch what the picture really is. Amen.
[1:00:01] A partial picture is not sufficient. We
[1:00:04] can preach Jesus Christ today. We can
[1:00:07] preach baptism today. We can preach a
[1:00:09] lot of things today. But God's not
[1:00:11] wanting you to just see one portion of
[1:00:13] the picture. He wants you to see the
[1:00:15] whole picture. He's bringing out right
[1:00:18] that the fullness of the mystery in this
[1:00:20] day of the Godhead bodily, the fullness
[1:00:22] of the mystery of Christ needed to be
[1:00:25] expressed. And I believe that it is
[1:00:27] expressed in this day because without
[1:00:29] the whole picture, you won't make it.
[1:00:32] You can acknowledge Jesus died on
[1:00:34] Calvary. You can acknowledge baptism.
[1:00:36] You can acknowledge all these things.
[1:00:38] But God is wanting to put every piece of
[1:00:41] the picture together. Brother Brandham
[1:00:44] uses that analogy. Otherwise, we end up
[1:00:46] with a cow in the top of the tree. Amen.
[1:00:48] And that's not going to work. So, every
[1:00:51] picture or part of the picture in its
[1:00:54] correct position. And this is why by the
[1:00:57] preaching of the word, it is setting
[1:00:59] things in order. They would be those
[1:01:00] that would say, "Well, these are not new
[1:01:02] truths. These are not uh new
[1:01:04] revelations. These are not new." No,
[1:01:06] that's right. It's a time of setting it
[1:01:09] in order. That's right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And that's what God's des doing today,
[1:01:13] desiring to do today. Amen. So, here it
[1:01:16] is as it is in Isaiah 62, a new name.
[1:01:20] But the word clearly says it will be the
[1:01:23] mouth of the Lord that names this name.
[1:01:27] Now, if we'll turn in our Bibles uh
[1:01:29] today or look on the screen, Revelation
[1:01:32] 21:17, very familiar scripture for us.
[1:01:35] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:01:39] the spirit saith unto the churches. Now,
[1:01:42] this has been really speaking to me
[1:01:44] lately because, my brother and sister,
[1:01:46] we can quote, we can we can quote the
[1:01:50] prophet. We can quote ministries, good
[1:01:52] men of God. We can quote uh uh those in
[1:01:56] our midst and those abroad. We can do a
[1:01:58] lot of quoting. But here it is giving a
[1:02:01] very clear picture. But what we need to
[1:02:03] hear is what the spirit is saying. We
[1:02:06] can have the word and the word will be
[1:02:09] good. It will be sufficient. Will be
[1:02:11] inspiring. But without the spirit
[1:02:14] speaking to us, my brother and sister,
[1:02:16] it's just words. It will be something
[1:02:18] that we try to uh uh analyze,
[1:02:21] categorize. we we want to put it in a
[1:02:24] place but we'll then have a certain
[1:02:26] amount of our own understanding own
[1:02:29] intellect own revelation being put in
[1:02:32] there but when the spirit speaks to you
[1:02:34] when it's God speaking to you personal
[1:02:38] then it is not subject to interpretation
[1:02:40] of this man or that man. Amen. I was
[1:02:43] going to pull a quote over and I didn't
[1:02:45] do it. But the prophet of God says the
[1:02:47] problem that we have is that um uh we
[1:02:51] hear something and instead of going to
[1:02:53] God for the answer, we go to the
[1:02:56] preacher, the pastor, we go to this man,
[1:02:58] we go to that person to to understand or
[1:03:01] try to see what is being said. And
[1:03:04] brother Brandham is implying there that
[1:03:07] what we really need to do is go back to
[1:03:09] the spirit, ask the Lord, you know, what
[1:03:12] is this, the right and the wrong of it.
[1:03:13] Now my brother and sister, let me just
[1:03:15] put that in a little bit of context.
[1:03:17] There'll come a time or may come a time,
[1:03:19] let me put it that way, that they'll
[1:03:21] shut the doors of this church and they
[1:03:23] would come and take your Bibles away and
[1:03:26] they would for uh forbid you to assemble
[1:03:29] together. You come into a season as it
[1:03:31] was the dark ages of little or no
[1:03:34] fellowship amongst the saints. Now, when
[1:03:37] you hear these things being spoken, when
[1:03:40] you see these things a and that uh uh
[1:03:43] that uh deceiving spirit would come in
[1:03:46] the land and you can't go back and make
[1:03:49] a quick phone call. What does this mean?
[1:03:51] What does that mean? You're going to
[1:03:53] need to hear the spirit.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You're going to need to hear what God is
[1:03:58] speaking to you or you will be deceived.
[1:04:01] Now, we put that in proper context that
[1:04:03] the bride of Christ cannot be deceived,
[1:04:06] right? It would do its very best to
[1:04:09] deceive you, but you can't be deceived.
[1:04:11] But you shouldn't take that as, well,
[1:04:13] praise God, I don't need to do anything.
[1:04:15] I can't be deceived. No, my brother and
[1:04:17] sister, if you're the bride of Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ, you're going to make your
[1:04:21] calling and election sure. You're going
[1:04:23] to nail that down yourself. You're not
[1:04:26] going to say, "I'll just rely on what
[1:04:28] brother Paul preaches. uh I'll just rely
[1:04:30] on this or on that or what I can get off
[1:04:33] the internet. My brother and sister, God
[1:04:35] wants you today to make your calling,
[1:04:38] your election sure. That's where you
[1:04:41] hear the spirit speaking to you. Amen.
[1:04:45] So, he that hath an ear, hear what the
[1:04:47] spirit saith unto the churches, to him
[1:04:49] that overcomemeth. So, not the w man who
[1:04:52] gives up, not the man who who says, I
[1:04:54] I've went as far as I can go. I'm done.
[1:04:57] No. To him that overcomemeth will I give
[1:04:59] to eat of a hidden mana, and will give
[1:05:02] him a white stone, and in the stone a
[1:05:04] new name written, which no man knoweth,
[1:05:07] saving he that receiveth it. Now, I I
[1:05:11] don't want to go too far off on this uh
[1:05:13] little rabbit trail, but through the
[1:05:15] ages, through the years, there's been
[1:05:17] men that come and said, "It's been
[1:05:18] revealed to me the new name." Well, my
[1:05:20] brother and sister, the thing is there
[1:05:23] we would be no new name or no
[1:05:25] understanding of the new name except to
[1:05:27] the one that receive it. So man comes
[1:05:30] and says, "I've got a revelation of the
[1:05:32] new name." That's good. You don't have
[1:05:34] to push back against that. But that's
[1:05:37] not the new name to you because you have
[1:05:40] to be the one who received it to know
[1:05:42] what the new name is. So this is not
[1:05:45] some universal doctrine to be preached
[1:05:47] or to be brought out and say I have the
[1:05:50] answer come to me for the answer but it
[1:05:52] will be the spirit speaking to you will
[1:05:55] re reveal the new name to you. Amen. And
[1:05:58] God is doing that right now. He's coming
[1:06:00] through the word to reveal himself to
[1:06:04] you. Now let's just look for a moment.
[1:06:07] White is a color of purity.
[1:06:11] So, you're going to be given a white
[1:06:14] stone,
[1:06:17] something that's going to be pure. It's
[1:06:19] not a tarnished stone. It's not It's not
[1:06:22] something that's been laying in the
[1:06:24] dirt. Now, I'm not preaching this as
[1:06:26] doctrine. I want to stir up your pure
[1:06:28] minds today. Okay? So, white is purity.
[1:06:32] Now, a stone is used through scripture
[1:06:37] as a memorial. Many times there's been
[1:06:40] memorials that were placed and God
[1:06:42] anointed Ben to put up piles of rocks
[1:06:45] which other generations
[1:06:47] uh don't really look at, maybe don't
[1:06:50] fully understand. It didn't matter. God
[1:06:52] said, "You know what? When they crossed
[1:06:54] over Jordan, he sent them back into the
[1:06:56] river. They picked up stones out of the
[1:06:59] crossing, out of the water. not just a
[1:07:02] convenient stone on the bank, but he
[1:07:04] caused them to go back into the depths
[1:07:07] of the riverbed and pick up stones and
[1:07:09] bring them out and stack them up in a
[1:07:12] memorial. And it'd be like, why is why
[1:07:15] is this? And it was so that future
[1:07:18] generations, you could come and bring
[1:07:21] your children. This is what the
[1:07:22] scripture says. Bring their children
[1:07:24] back to that place right there and say
[1:07:27] God did a mighty work and delivered us
[1:07:29] out of the influence of Egypt and we
[1:07:32] came into the promised land which is the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:07:37] this is a memorial. So children, this is
[1:07:40] a reminder of what God has done for us.
[1:07:44] But God didn't say now just come back
[1:07:46] and worship this pile of stones. Amen.
[1:07:48] It was a memorial. A memorial is there
[1:07:51] as a remembrance. Right? And so a stone
[1:07:55] is also used as a foundation. And it is
[1:07:58] there that we see see through the
[1:08:00] scripture. Amen. We see the scripture
[1:08:03] laying out that um uh the foundation.
[1:08:08] Now it was upon Peter the rock. But
[1:08:12] brother Brandham so clearly shows us
[1:08:15] that it was not Peter himself as many
[1:08:18] theologians would say. Oh, Peter was the
[1:08:20] foundation of the church. No, my brother
[1:08:22] and sister, Peter being interpreted as
[1:08:25] little rock was nothing more than a
[1:08:28] representation of revelation. So, it's
[1:08:31] upon revelation that God is building his
[1:08:34] church. And a white stone, a memorial is
[1:08:38] also a foundation. And so, we see that
[1:08:41] revelation is the foundation of the true
[1:08:44] church or believer. Amen. This is not a
[1:08:47] matter of academic study that we come
[1:08:50] and we put scriptures together and
[1:08:52] convince you because I can tell you
[1:08:54] right now that every religion there is
[1:08:57] has scripture that they have put
[1:08:59] together to prove where they stand. But
[1:09:03] if the spirit is not speaking it,
[1:09:07] it's a man work. And if man does the
[1:09:10] work, it will fail as the work of man
[1:09:14] always does. Just think about how great
[1:09:18] Rome was as a society.
[1:09:23] And what did they fall from?
[1:09:26] The same spirit of Sodom
[1:09:30] that is present today.
[1:09:32] Lovers of pleasure
[1:09:35] more than lovers of God.
[1:09:38] having a form of godliness. They worship
[1:09:40] their idols. Now, I heard a lovely
[1:09:43] statement made the other day about uh
[1:09:46] idol worship and and um these deceiving
[1:09:50] spirits. And idol worship, my brother
[1:09:52] and sister, would not be now focus okay
[1:09:55] if you would. Idol worship would not be
[1:09:58] that brother Paul would come and have
[1:10:01] introduced to the church today something
[1:10:03] here and saying God showed me this is
[1:10:06] this is something important and we
[1:10:08] should worship this.
[1:10:12] You'd say but that is idol worship. I'm
[1:10:14] talking about real believers.
[1:10:17] Idol worship
[1:10:19] is worshiping the true God
[1:10:23] falsely.
[1:10:26] It's not introducing another god.
[1:10:30] Idol worship that you and I need to be
[1:10:32] concerned about. Right? We don't have
[1:10:35] Buddha in our house. We don't have
[1:10:37] Confucious. We don't have any of that
[1:10:39] kind of stuff in our house. But we can
[1:10:42] have the truth
[1:10:44] and worship the truth falsely. That's
[1:10:48] right.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; So you have to be careful, my brother
[1:10:50] and sister. We're living in that age
[1:10:53] that it will deceive if it can. But now
[1:10:56] look, this white stone, this foundation
[1:10:59] is there. And as I already said,
[1:11:02] revelation is the foundation of the true
[1:11:05] church or the true believer. Revelation
[1:11:07] is that foundation. Now, my brother and
[1:11:10] sister, when we're talking about stones,
[1:11:12] we're not talking about the believer
[1:11:14] having a hard heart. We're talking about
[1:11:16] a fleshly table of the heart. The
[1:11:18] scripture says that is tender and
[1:11:20] moldable. It can be written upon. God
[1:11:24] didn't introduce a holy chisel to write
[1:11:27] on your heart.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought the word and the word
[1:11:31] come and started to write on your heart
[1:11:33] because your heart is moldable. Your
[1:11:36] heart is such that that God can lay
[1:11:38] principles and put them and it's not as
[1:11:42] it were a surface religion. This is a
[1:11:44] problem we have in the 21st century. is
[1:11:47] so much of religion is a surface
[1:11:51] religion. It is something that we do as
[1:11:54] it were uh because our families always
[1:11:56] went to church. Uh I I share this with a
[1:12:00] little bit of humor. I won't name the
[1:12:01] religion but I have a good friend uh and
[1:12:04] um uh he he I was talking to him. He
[1:12:08] actually called me about a little
[1:12:09] business matter and he he and his wife
[1:12:12] were taking a little trip and we were
[1:12:15] chatting back and forth. This is a man
[1:12:17] that uh I have talked uh sometimes in
[1:12:21] hours long conversation as he would be
[1:12:23] traveling and uh not he's not ashamed to
[1:12:26] talk about these things in front of his
[1:12:28] family and he'd be on speaker phone in
[1:12:30] his car and and we'd be talking and we'd
[1:12:33] get done. Now this is not lifting up
[1:12:35] Paul but this is the truth when it's
[1:12:37] unfolded and we'd get done and he'd say,
[1:12:40] "Man, I've been so blessed by this
[1:12:42] conversation. I've never heard these
[1:12:44] things before." And so it's there, but
[1:12:47] we're in a conversation on the phone.
[1:12:49] Sister Jerry was there, could overhear
[1:12:51] this conversation. He said, "My wife and
[1:12:53] I are taking a trip and we're going to
[1:12:55] go. We're not actually doing the work.
[1:12:57] We're not going to be out there
[1:12:58] proceliting people, but others will be."
[1:13:03] Now, my brother and sister, we're not
[1:13:05] here to procelite anybody. If the Holy
[1:13:08] Spirit doesn't stir your heart, nothing
[1:13:11] will stir your heart. We can give you
[1:13:14] all kinds of studies and literature and
[1:13:16] all kinds of knowledge and we can graph
[1:13:18] it all out and put it all together. How
[1:13:21] many of you have seen that that timeline
[1:13:23] calendar they have uh of the scripture
[1:13:26] and the ages of when who was born and
[1:13:28] what happened? You know what I'm talking
[1:13:30] about? It's a just a huge the paper
[1:13:33] version of it just would cover this wall
[1:13:35] and it comes together and you look at
[1:13:37] all these things and how incredible that
[1:13:39] is. You could have that memorized. It
[1:13:42] wouldn't do one thing for your
[1:13:43] salvation. Amen. To know exactly when it
[1:13:46] happened, my brother and sister. Do you
[1:13:48] realize how close things can be that
[1:13:51] Enoch and Adam walked on the earth at
[1:13:53] the same time? Amen. I I love this cuz
[1:13:56] Enoch, Amen, was walking into the
[1:13:59] promise and Adam had walked out of the
[1:14:02] promise, but they were on the earth at
[1:14:05] the same time. Now, that's not to say
[1:14:07] that Adam had not found reconciliation
[1:14:10] with God. But I'm telling you that the
[1:14:13] anointing that was there brought Adam
[1:14:15] out of the garden and it took and
[1:14:17] anointed Enoch so much that Enoch was
[1:14:20] searching for a way back into the
[1:14:23] presence of God. Amen. And that's what
[1:14:25] God's doing with you and I, my brother
[1:14:27] and sister. We're not here, this is why
[1:14:29] I made my opening statements. We're not
[1:14:31] here to say, "Well, we're living under
[1:14:33] the curse." I tell you, I'm living under
[1:14:36] the blessing and I'm moving back into
[1:14:38] the presence of God. I'm coming back
[1:14:40] into the promise that was there
[1:14:42] originally. We're not standing here to
[1:14:44] say the curse, the curse, the curse. Oh,
[1:14:47] this is curse. That's cursed. Let me
[1:14:49] tell you how personal this is with me. I
[1:14:51] don't know how many of you's occupation
[1:14:53] is named that the very way that you live
[1:14:56] and work and labor is cursed. But I am
[1:15:01] living under that as a farmer. The very
[1:15:04] soil is cursed. You leave a field alone
[1:15:07] for a little season, it will grow every
[1:15:09] kind of weed. But you'll never find a
[1:15:11] field of corn. Volunteer itself to grow.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But the weeds will show up just all you
[1:15:18] got to do is ignore it. They'll show up.
[1:15:21] My brother and sister, that's the curse.
[1:15:23] But I'm not living under a curse. I'm
[1:15:25] living under a blessing that came out of
[1:15:26] the word of God. I was called out of
[1:15:29] that to live and participate and
[1:15:32] actually fulfill or manifest that
[1:15:34] blessing of promise. Amen. So this
[1:15:37] foundations there God riding on the
[1:15:40] tender moldable hearts of sons and
[1:15:43] daughters of God. Now let me sum this up
[1:15:46] in simplicity. Pure revelation of who
[1:15:50] you really are. That's really one of the
[1:15:53] things I don't want to I don't want to
[1:15:54] misguide and say that some of these
[1:15:57] things don't matter the understanding
[1:15:59] and and to see but I'm telling you my
[1:16:01] brother and sister none of this means
[1:16:03] anything if you don't know who you are.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; If you go year after year studying your
[1:16:10] Bible and praying and come to conclusion
[1:16:13] that I just hope I make it. I just uh
[1:16:16] you don't know who you are because when
[1:16:18] you study out the word, the word will
[1:16:21] reveal to you who you are and where you
[1:16:24] stand in the word of God. That's what
[1:16:26] the revelation or opening of the word
[1:16:28] was for. Not just to have something we
[1:16:30] conform. You know, men short hair,
[1:16:33] sisters long dresses, long hair, blah
[1:16:35] blah blah. No, we're not talking about
[1:16:37] conforming. God was informing us of who
[1:16:40] we really were. Amen. He didn't come and
[1:16:42] say, "I'm going to make you conform." He
[1:16:44] come through the word to inform you. And
[1:16:46] when you are informed, there's something
[1:16:49] inside of you says, "Praise God, that's
[1:16:51] who I am right there." And nobody has to
[1:16:54] browbeat you at church. Nobody has to
[1:16:56] preach at you. Nobody has to, as it
[1:16:58] were, throw stones to get you to see. It
[1:17:02] is a revelation that's already down in
[1:17:04] your heart. And when the word comes to
[1:17:07] it, oh my, you can't tell me that you
[1:17:10] won't know when God starts to ride on
[1:17:12] your heart. Amen. When God starts to
[1:17:14] ride on your heart, you see
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; who you are
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; the pure revelation
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; of who you are not teaching.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Teaching helps reveal
[1:17:31] but it is not the revelation of
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So preaching and teaching and all
[1:17:39] of these things are good, but we'll
[1:17:41] never make you what you aren't. Amen. We
[1:17:44] can bring a skunk to church and we can
[1:17:46] never never, no matter how much we call
[1:17:48] him kitty, will never turn him into a
[1:17:51] cat. And you'll never, my brother and
[1:17:53] sister, take an unbeliever and bring him
[1:17:56] to church. He could be in church service
[1:17:57] every day of his life with the Holy
[1:17:59] Spirit moving and signs and wonders and
[1:18:01] manifestation. And it will not just for
[1:18:04] his attending church make him a
[1:18:05] believer.
[1:18:07] Amen. But if there is a seed down there
[1:18:10] and that writing upon the heart is
[1:18:12] revealed by the preaching of the word
[1:18:14] and you say, "But we've heard this
[1:18:16] before. We've heard this before." Well,
[1:18:18] let me put it this way. Don't don't be
[1:18:19] offended. But some people just have so
[1:18:22] much trash piled on top of their heart.
[1:18:25] God's got to slowly dig his way through
[1:18:28] it. And he digs his way through it. And
[1:18:30] when it gets down, he writes that on the
[1:18:33] heart. And it's there that they say,
[1:18:34] "Oh, praise God, my brother and sister."
[1:18:37] You know, we have friends in the
[1:18:38] message. We have brothers uh that that
[1:18:41] have uh you know, they might not share
[1:18:43] it with you. You might have met some of
[1:18:45] these brothers, but they won't share it
[1:18:47] with you uh just because they don't want
[1:18:49] to uh as the brother says, blow you
[1:18:51] away.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; But when God come and started dealing
[1:18:55] with them,
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; they started out thinking, "Oh, they're
[1:18:59] trying to make me guilty."
[1:19:01] And then he just realized God was just
[1:19:03] bringing up the list that was already
[1:19:05] listed against him. It was not that he
[1:19:08] was condemning him of it. He was just
[1:19:10] giving him the opportunity to say,
[1:19:12] "Forgive me for that, Lord. Forgive me
[1:19:13] for that. Forgive me for that. Forgive
[1:19:15] me for that." And it's there when he got
[1:19:17] down. You know, if you've ever ignored
[1:19:19] your emails, I did this sometime back
[1:19:22] here. I just thought, "Ha, I'm just
[1:19:25] ignore this junk." But you know what
[1:19:26] happens? You end up with 1198 of them
[1:19:28] things in your phone. And then your
[1:19:31] phone starts getting weird cuz it's got
[1:19:33] no more memory. And so you say, "You
[1:19:34] know what I'm going to do? I'm going to
[1:19:36] go through here. I'm going to delete
[1:19:37] this." Well, you know, it's way smarter.
[1:19:39] Now, this is not a computer thing cuz
[1:19:41] that's not me. But it's just like way
[1:19:43] smarter to stay on track.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Delete.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Delete.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Delete.
[1:19:53] You'll never make the rapture. Delete.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; You're not good enough. Delete.
[1:19:59] You did this. Delete.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You thought that. Delete.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Delete. Delete. Delete. Delete.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't delete it, Satan
[1:20:08] will just pile it up and pile it up.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; But as long as you can come back to the
[1:20:13] word and say, "The word says delete."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Not deleting the word. You're taking the
[1:20:19] word to delete what Satan is saying. Oh,
[1:20:22] delete. Delete. Delete. Delete. And the
[1:20:23] word's saying that's not you. Delete.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't hold that against you.
[1:20:27] Delete. Amen. That'll never be brought
[1:20:30] up. Delete.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You see, my brothers and sister, what
[1:20:33] God's doing is he's bringing us to a
[1:20:35] place that we have a pure revelation of
[1:20:39] who we really are.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not a intellectual uh
[1:20:44] revelation. Not not just, you know,
[1:20:46] something that that uh you know, hey, my
[1:20:48] family my family, you know, I was born
[1:20:50] in the message. You hear this a lot when
[1:20:52] you get around young people. I was born
[1:20:53] in the message. Okay. After you were
[1:20:56] born, did you just stay a baby?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; No. You started to grow.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And as you started to grow, you started
[1:21:06] to face different challenges.
[1:21:10] Now, those different challenges, my
[1:21:12] brother and sister, might be a little
[1:21:14] bit different.
[1:21:16] And I'll just use this simple analogy if
[1:21:18] you don't mind. The 11th hour worker
[1:21:21] makes some of us that have been around
[1:21:22] the message our whole lives
[1:21:25] look as though we've done nothing for
[1:21:27] years.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But you see what God's done is he's
[1:21:31] bringing them up to speed in the word
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; while we were so so slow.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister, another
[1:21:42] simple analogy if you don't mind. We
[1:21:44] farm some ground and there's great big
[1:21:46] trees on one side of the field.
[1:21:49] It's about noon or 1:00 every day before
[1:21:52] the sun actually strikes this part of
[1:21:54] the field.
[1:21:56] And then when you harvest a field, you
[1:21:58] kind of forget. And it's like, why is
[1:22:01] the rest of the field mature?
[1:22:04] And this part is green.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Because it has to bask in the sun.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The 11th hour worker is about the
[1:22:15] time the sun starts to reach its height
[1:22:17] and the light starts to shine down. Some
[1:22:20] of us been living in the shadows of the
[1:22:21] message for far too long. You've said,
[1:22:24] "I'm a message believer. I go to church.
[1:22:26] I love brother so and so's preaching. I
[1:22:28] love this. I've been to this revival.
[1:22:30] I've been to this camp. I've been to
[1:22:32] these special meetings." But are you
[1:22:34] actually basking in the sun? There's the
[1:22:37] key that comes down. Now, let me move
[1:22:40] on. Revelations 3:12
[1:22:45] says, "He that overcomemeth will I make
[1:22:47] a pillar in the temple of my God."
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Now, where is the temple of God?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; It's not down the road somewhere. It's
[1:23:01] not on Mount whatever somewhere you are
[1:23:05] the temple. So God's going to make you a
[1:23:08] temple in the very creation that he has
[1:23:12] made of you.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Now some people say that that's just too
[1:23:16] weird. What are you saying? What I'm
[1:23:18] saying is is God's raising you up under
[1:23:21] a pure revelation of who you really are.
[1:23:24] That I am the temple of almighty God of
[1:23:28] my Lord Jesus Christ. And now he's
[1:23:30] making me a pillar. You don't take you
[1:23:35] can let me stop. You can take something
[1:23:37] else. An artifact or in the temple can
[1:23:42] be removed
[1:23:44] but you don't remove the pillar. So in
[1:23:47] other words, God's telling you, I'm
[1:23:49] going to make you an absolute unmovable,
[1:23:52] immovable portion of the creation of my
[1:23:56] dwelling place. In other words, you are
[1:23:58] going to stand here as a memorial of
[1:24:01] time. And what did they build those out
[1:24:03] of? They didn't build that temple. They
[1:24:05] didn't build that pillar out of
[1:24:07] cardboard. They didn't build it out of
[1:24:09] out of some cheap whatever recycled
[1:24:11] pallets or something of that nature. But
[1:24:14] they built it out of the very solid
[1:24:16] stone. The revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:19] standing in you being there that you can
[1:24:22] stand every test of time. We have
[1:24:24] visited Israel. We have visited the
[1:24:26] places that different things armies
[1:24:28] destroyed it. The Roman army destroyed a
[1:24:30] lot of these things and and uh you know
[1:24:33] you remember what's what's the mount we
[1:24:35] rode the cable car up on top
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Mada
[1:24:43] you can just look it up on the internet
[1:24:44] you go to Msada uh those those pillars
[1:24:48] some of them still standing after all
[1:24:50] this time many of them knocked down I
[1:24:52] hope you see the analogy some of those
[1:24:55] were able to stand the test of time and
[1:24:58] are still standing, but there was
[1:25:00] hundreds around them that have fallen.
[1:25:03] Amen. That's not a pillar that's
[1:25:05] standing in the house of God. Those are
[1:25:07] pillars that were once there, but have
[1:25:09] fallen. Amen. And God saying, "I made
[1:25:11] you a pillar, and you're going to still
[1:25:13] stand. You're going to be standing in my
[1:25:15] house." Amen. I remember when we were
[1:25:18] standing there on top of the uh uh Msada
[1:25:20] that day. Amen. And we're looking there
[1:25:23] at that mountain. You're looking at all
[1:25:25] of those different things. And brother
[1:25:27] George and I were were having a little
[1:25:29] conversation. And it was actually
[1:25:31] Brother George that says, "It's amazing
[1:25:34] how it would be that some would stand
[1:25:36] and some would fall." And even when the
[1:25:39] Romans come and assaulted it, uh why did
[1:25:41] they choose to knock this over, but they
[1:25:43] left this? Maybe it wasn't their
[1:25:45] decision. Why did Satan in this hour, he
[1:25:48] come to knock this over and he tried to
[1:25:51] knock you over, but you're anchored.
[1:25:54] Amen. You're set in the solid rock of
[1:25:57] Jesus Christ. Amen. The firm foundation.
[1:26:00] This is a stone that was a foundational
[1:26:03] stone. And that's where you stand today.
[1:26:06] That's who you are today. Amen. And we
[1:26:09] look at that and realize by the
[1:26:10] scripture. No new revelation here, but
[1:26:13] you are the new new Jerusalem. Amen. You
[1:26:17] are that place that God is speaking
[1:26:19] about that's coming down. when he says
[1:26:21] it's coming down out of heaven a as as a
[1:26:25] a city, a beautiful thing coming down as
[1:26:28] a bride adorned for her husband. It's
[1:26:33] right there in scripture. Isn't it
[1:26:34] amazing how God would hide that? So,
[1:26:36] people are thinking there's going to be
[1:26:38] this big city going to come right out of
[1:26:40] the heavens and float right down. But
[1:26:42] the truth of it is that New Jerusalem,
[1:26:45] you, the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:26:47] His wife that has been adorned, is right
[1:26:50] here, right now. And God is blessing her
[1:26:53] right now, raising her up in heavenly
[1:26:56] places right now. It's not something
[1:26:58] he's got to do some supernatural unheard
[1:27:00] of thing and bring a city out of the
[1:27:03] heavens. He's not bringing a city down.
[1:27:06] He's raising a city up.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This bride, it doesn't have to
[1:27:10] have some supernatural event at the end
[1:27:13] to bring it down. My brother and sister,
[1:27:15] he is here.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seventh seal was open, it
[1:27:19] declared he is here. Amen. And so we are
[1:27:23] here now under the influence of that
[1:27:25] word being raised up. Hallelujah. So
[1:27:28] God's not going to do some supernatural
[1:27:30] event like the sci-fi movies have some
[1:27:33] kind of new creation floating down from
[1:27:35] heaven. Amen. We are new creation in
[1:27:38] Jesus Christ right now. Amen. Being
[1:27:41] lifted up into heavenly places.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; So as we look at this now, what does God
[1:27:49] what does the word of God tells us that
[1:27:52] uh the prophet's words, but it's the
[1:27:54] word speaking it? He just put it out in
[1:27:55] these words that uh the bride of Jesus
[1:27:59] Christ will be the final voice
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; to the final age. Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that for
[1:28:06] a moment.
[1:28:08] It's not going to be another prophet.
[1:28:11] It's not going to be another great man.
[1:28:15] It's going to be you rising up.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; It's going to be the word in you rising
[1:28:24] up.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Is going to be that final voice.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love how the word is
[1:28:30] because, you know, instead of preaching
[1:28:32] me a sermon, just live it for me.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; That's what the bride's message is going
[1:28:37] to be. We are not going to take a
[1:28:38] sandwich sign and have to stand. There
[1:28:41] are some who believe that still, but we
[1:28:43] are not called of God to take a sandwich
[1:28:45] sign and stand on the corner and and
[1:28:48] say, you know, Jesus is coming.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, the world's heard
[1:28:53] it so much they could care less about
[1:28:54] it. And those that even pay attention to
[1:28:57] it won't live it. That's right.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; It's right in front of them and they
[1:29:00] say, "I want to do what I want to do,
[1:29:02] the way I want to do it, when I want to
[1:29:04] do it, how I want to do it, where I want
[1:29:06] to do it." So, it's all about them. It's
[1:29:08] not actually about what does my
[1:29:09] bridegroom, what does the Lord Jesus
[1:29:11] Christ want. It's about what I want.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Seen a child the other day sitting on
[1:29:19] the floor sobbing
[1:29:22] and the mom says, "You're not getting
[1:29:25] it." And the little kid was sitting
[1:29:28] there kicking its feet out and hitting
[1:29:30] its hands on the concrete. Made my hands
[1:29:32] hurt as the little guy's like,
[1:29:40] what was the little kid's voice? Not
[1:29:42] mama, you promised.
[1:29:45] I want.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; I want. Give it to me. I want.
[1:29:52] Well, imagine if we seek the Holy Ghost
[1:29:54] like that child was seeking that candy.
[1:29:58] God would give it to you.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; But the world is today saying, "I want
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I want give it to me."
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; A sign of prosperity
[1:30:11] is the new sign of the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:14] Oh, that's not us saying that. That's
[1:30:16] ministers out there saying that.
[1:30:19] men that were called to be a voice.
[1:30:23] Amen. A minister that's been known
[1:30:25] around the world on the internet just
[1:30:27] passed away a few days ago from some
[1:30:29] kind of a health event. Um I I don't
[1:30:33] even know how you say his name. Vodum
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Bachman.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Vod Bachmann. Amen. The man spoke truth.
[1:30:40] If you ever listen to much of what he
[1:30:41] said, the man spoke truth.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; The world won't be able to say we didn't
[1:30:46] hear truth.
[1:30:47] They don't have to hear it from you.
[1:30:50] You you realize that he was anointed and
[1:30:54] called. We're not preaching on those
[1:30:56] modes, but Charlie Kirk, there's a man
[1:30:58] who spoke in a public forum many, many,
[1:31:01] many words of absolute truth.
[1:31:05] He didn't say you got to come to church
[1:31:07] to get it, but he spoke it in a forum
[1:31:11] that God chose for him to speak it. And
[1:31:14] the message of the hour, the preaching
[1:31:16] of the word says, "Come to the house of
[1:31:18] God. Come that I can let this ministry
[1:31:21] perfect you." It's not the ministry.
[1:31:23] Come on, folks. There's people that say,
[1:31:25] "Oh, the preachers have failed us." What
[1:31:27] they're saying is God failed us.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. I know that's straight, but
[1:31:33] that's what they're really saying
[1:31:34] because the word said that that ministry
[1:31:36] of Ephesians would come for the
[1:31:39] perfecting of the saints. And they say,
[1:31:40] "We don't want them to perfect us. this
[1:31:43] won't do it. We don't believe in it. And
[1:31:46] then they say, "See, we're not
[1:31:47] perfected, so that proves it." Well,
[1:31:50] they never believed that they were going
[1:31:51] to be perfected.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; But when the word comes and you believe
[1:31:55] that the word's going to have that
[1:31:57] impact on you, it will.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; What the prophet of God say, Amen. You
[1:32:02] go to a church that preaches Jesus is
[1:32:04] divine.
[1:32:06] He didn't say that preaches everything
[1:32:07] just perfect.
[1:32:10] And then you glean.
[1:32:12] Some of you might be this morning just
[1:32:14] gleaning.
[1:32:16] Boy, that was quiet.
[1:32:19] I take that as an amen. You're just
[1:32:21] you're just gleaning.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; But you see what portion you believe,
[1:32:27] God will bless you with.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That portion that you believe that you
[1:32:34] held on to.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, he's long-winded. He's this.
[1:32:38] He's that. Sometimes he doesn't make
[1:32:40] sense. Am I your savior?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Am I your healer?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Am I your deliverer?
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; No, sir. But the one who is, if you will
[1:32:50] believe on him, he will fulfill those
[1:32:54] things in your life.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; But we have a human problem and that's
[1:32:59] looking at human.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we don't think the human's
[1:33:02] doing it right, then we reject all of
[1:33:05] it. Why don't you just say, you know
[1:33:07] what, that was his opinion or that was
[1:33:09] his way. Maybe just poor vocabulary.
[1:33:12] Maybe it was just poor words that he
[1:33:14] used. Why don't you look on it and say,
[1:33:16] "Is that in the word or not?" And when
[1:33:18] you find it in the word, say, "I believe
[1:33:19] it, Lord."
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That sure take a lot of naysayers
[1:33:23] uh uh doing their naysaying. Because if
[1:33:25] they would actually take time to take it
[1:33:27] back to the word, they would realize
[1:33:29] that in fact uh no matter how uh the the
[1:33:33] preacher failed to articulate it, well,
[1:33:36] if it's in the word, you believe the
[1:33:38] word.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that, as the Apostle Paul
[1:33:41] said, I don't come with you with this
[1:33:44] perfect speech and these words of wisdom
[1:33:47] to convince you to do this, but I come
[1:33:49] in power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:33:51] Ghost. And if we would look at the power
[1:33:53] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and
[1:33:55] forget about how the man may not quite
[1:33:58] phrase the words correct. So, yeah, I
[1:34:00] don't know about that. I I think he's
[1:34:02] off the word.
[1:34:05] Hard question. Sorry, I don't mean to be
[1:34:07] brutal this morning. Anytime you believe
[1:34:10] someone's off the word, my only question
[1:34:13] to you will be, did you actually go to
[1:34:15] the word
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; and see?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I've asked a few before. Well, they're
[1:34:21] off
[1:34:23] here.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Show me.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; They've got nothing.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; They're off my opinion.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; They're off my emotion.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Can I run around? pat everybody on the
[1:34:39] back so you don't leave today feeling
[1:34:40] bad.
[1:34:42] But you see, my brother and sister, this
[1:34:44] is all part of God's plan that we got to
[1:34:46] come to the place. And you say, "Well,
[1:34:48] what's this got to do with the mystery
[1:34:49] of our new name?" Well, the prophet of
[1:34:51] God said that uh God gives the Holy
[1:34:53] Ghost to the true anointing of the Holy
[1:34:55] Ghost. He gives that to those who are
[1:34:58] obedient to the word.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will put this in my words so
[1:35:03] you can reject it if you want. You will
[1:35:06] not receive a new name. Unless you have
[1:35:09] obedience. That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; To the word.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He don't just hand it out like candy.
[1:35:15] Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Revelations 22:17
[1:35:19] says, "And the spirit in the bride say,
[1:35:22] "Come." So, this bride of this day, this
[1:35:25] last days, uh, is going to be anointed
[1:35:29] to be able to say, "Come." And let him
[1:35:31] that heareth say, "Come." And let him
[1:35:33] that is a thirst come. and whosoever
[1:35:35] will, let him take of the water of life
[1:35:37] freely. Now, this bride in her ministry,
[1:35:41] see, she's got nothing to boast about,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; my brother and sister, but let's not be
[1:35:45] ashamed of it either. Sometimes we hear
[1:35:48] people say, "Well, I'm not worthy, but
[1:35:50] you know, like this is what God did for
[1:35:52] me, and I kind of like And what are we
[1:35:54] doing? We're downplaying, downplaying,
[1:35:55] downplaying, downplaying, downplaying,
[1:35:58] cuz you're looking at your flesh. Right?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You're looking at you.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And the word says the spirit and the
[1:36:06] bride say come. He didn't come and say
[1:36:09] the bridal say come when she's perfect.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; She's being perfected by the word of
[1:36:14] God.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by man's thinking. Not by
[1:36:18] man's ideas, man's ability, man's
[1:36:20] intellect, but she's coming under the
[1:36:23] anointing of the word of the spirit of
[1:36:26] the age. And so I know what your answer
[1:36:29] will be, but I'll say it anyway. Amen.
[1:36:32] How many of you are perfect this
[1:36:33] morning?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, some of you would say, "No, I
[1:36:37] make these mist." No. No. See, there's
[1:36:39] the flesh rising itself up right there
[1:36:42] to keep you from stepping into your
[1:36:44] rightful position because the word of
[1:36:46] God says, "You are righteous because I'm
[1:36:48] righteous. You're holy because I'm holy.
[1:36:50] You're perfect because I'm perfect." It
[1:36:53] wasn't about you in the first place.
[1:36:56] We'll never reach a status of hearing a
[1:36:58] new name if we keep looking at our flesh
[1:37:01] because our flesh is our own stumbling
[1:37:04] block.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But God says, "If you'll just look to me
[1:37:08] and what I said about you and how I feel
[1:37:10] about you and what my word is capable
[1:37:12] of, then you will reach heights you
[1:37:15] never would reach on your own."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And God wants you to reach those
[1:37:20] heights. So maybe it's about time for us
[1:37:23] to remind ourselves to get that out. In
[1:37:26] fact, the prophet of God says it this
[1:37:27] way. He says, 'When you say, "I'm not a
[1:37:29] very good Christian and I'm weak and I'm
[1:37:32] this and that." He says, "You're
[1:37:33] speaking the devil's language."
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do we do? Let's stand up and
[1:37:37] say, "Look, I it's been revealed to me."
[1:37:39] Anybody got a revelation this morning?
[1:37:41] It's been revealed to me. I'm a son of
[1:37:44] God. I'm a daughter of God. Amen. The
[1:37:46] blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient for
[1:37:49] every mistake I made. And I like how one
[1:37:52] man put it. He said, "When God called
[1:37:54] you to serve him, he factored in your
[1:37:57] stupidity."
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He already factored it in. It's
[1:38:02] already part of the plan. He's already
[1:38:04] got that settled. He's going to do this,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; but I've covered it.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; It's going to say this, but I've covered
[1:38:12] it.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] Amen. This bride in her ministry,
[1:38:18] nothing to boast but the grace of God.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac had several songs that had
[1:38:25] different verses today that just really
[1:38:26] spoke to my heart. Amen. Nothing.
[1:38:31] Grace is sufficient.
[1:38:34] Can somebody say that with me?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Grace is sufficient.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not grace and you. It's not
[1:38:43] grace and the message. Amen. It's grace.
[1:38:46] God's grace. Period. And you. Amen. You
[1:38:51] are the unlikely, unworthy
[1:38:54] portion. But imagine how amazing
[1:38:59] grace is.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; So, as you look at this, she's got
[1:39:05] nothing but a personal experience. This
[1:39:07] bride is coming forth. She's being
[1:39:09] molded.
[1:39:10] Now,
[1:39:13] anybody have a personal experience this
[1:39:15] morning?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Would you believe me if I told you this
[1:39:20] morning that your personal experience
[1:39:22] was nothing? That was just like
[1:39:23] something you read in a book. It was
[1:39:26] just something that just happened and
[1:39:27] that has not No, no, it's personal. You
[1:39:30] know, it happened.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You know where God brought you from. You
[1:39:34] know what God's done for you. You know
[1:39:37] my brother and sister and there should
[1:39:39] be no demon on earth that could talk you
[1:39:41] out of what you have experienced and
[1:39:45] know personally. Amen. When you are so
[1:39:47] to speak living on the edge of the abyss
[1:39:50] and Satan's there trying to coax you to
[1:39:52] step off and God called you back and
[1:39:54] something inside of you pulled you right
[1:39:57] back away from the abyss and you do that
[1:39:59] and somebody say, "Oh, that was a
[1:40:01] figment of your imagination." Amen. My
[1:40:03] brother and sister, that's not a figment
[1:40:05] of your imagination. That was the Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost that's in you. Amen. That's
[1:40:09] calling you back into the word, bringing
[1:40:11] you from those positions. It would have
[1:40:13] been for, you might say, eternal
[1:40:15] destruction is what Satan wants. Eternal
[1:40:17] separation. But God says, "No, come my
[1:40:20] daughter. Come my son." Amen, my sister.
[1:40:22] I don't want to embarrass my sister
[1:40:23] Lisa, but my brother and sister, when
[1:40:25] you've been in certain places in your
[1:40:27] life, addictions and different things
[1:40:29] that are there and you come and God has
[1:40:31] straightened up your life and you are
[1:40:33] standing here today as a daughter of
[1:40:35] God, my brother and sister, nobody's
[1:40:37] going to tell you that had no impact on
[1:40:38] your life. Nobody's going to tell you
[1:40:40] just kept on like that. It would have
[1:40:42] been just fine. But I'll tell you what,
[1:40:44] you stand upon the word yourself and are
[1:40:46] able to say, "God did that. God called
[1:40:49] me from that lie. God saved me from
[1:40:52] myself. God saved me from this world.
[1:40:54] And he's brought me into his presence of
[1:40:56] God. I don't care how many demons walk
[1:40:59] on the earth today and say, "That's
[1:41:00] nonsense." My brother and sister, you
[1:41:02] know better. You know what God has done.
[1:41:06] Amen. And you say, "But I was raised in
[1:41:08] the church. I've never done that. Never
[1:41:09] even took a sip of liquor, smoked a
[1:41:11] cigarette, or done any of those things."
[1:41:13] It's still God's amazing grace that has
[1:41:17] kept you.
[1:41:18] Satan will desire to destroy you. He
[1:41:21] wants to let the wolf loose in your
[1:41:23] house to bite and to tear and to
[1:41:26] destroy, my brother and sister. So what
[1:41:28] does God do? He gives us personal
[1:41:30] experience.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So what do you
[1:41:35] have here? Now when the spirit and the
[1:41:38] bride say come, Amen. She's not going to
[1:41:42] talk about, don't misunderstand me,
[1:41:46] she's not going to come when the spirit
[1:41:49] anoints the bride and she starts to
[1:41:52] speak. She's not going to quote the
[1:41:56] preacher.
[1:41:59] She might not even be quoting the
[1:42:02] prophet.
[1:42:04] There might be some influence that she
[1:42:05] would speak about. It's got to come down
[1:42:08] on that personal level.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I was lost,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; but now I'm found.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I had scars upon me, but the scars
[1:42:18] are healed.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I had these things here. Maybe it
[1:42:23] was that my mind had come to a place
[1:42:25] under pressure that it was weak. But he
[1:42:27] said that I would have a sound mind. And
[1:42:30] I stand here today with a sound mind.
[1:42:32] That was not a doctor. That was not a
[1:42:34] pill. That was not some kind of
[1:42:36] analysis. That was the Holy Ghost that
[1:42:38] come and said, "You're going to have a
[1:42:40] sound mind." And I believe it and God
[1:42:43] did it.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's the difference, my
[1:42:45] brother and sister. Not talking about
[1:42:47] what somebody else said, somebody else
[1:42:49] did, somebody else thought, but what God
[1:42:52] did for you.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's coming down God doing
[1:42:55] this. Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; What happens here? This bride, she's
[1:43:00] going to talk about how Christ the word
[1:43:02] is her experience. Amen. It's not going
[1:43:05] to be I went over and joined this church
[1:43:07] or joined that church. Amen. Uh not to
[1:43:10] say there's not good things that happen
[1:43:11] in those places. Don't misunderstand me.
[1:43:14] Very good things happen in those places.
[1:43:16] And in many times, God uses churches
[1:43:18] that are not even on the word of God to
[1:43:21] start a journey that leads you to the
[1:43:23] word of God.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember as a kid, I won't name
[1:43:27] the church, but my aunt and uncle,
[1:43:28] faithful attendants there. And while
[1:43:31] they were having church upstairs, these
[1:43:32] were these were of the old fact. Well,
[1:43:34] I'll just say it. They're Nazarene.
[1:43:36] Amen. And they were old Nazarene. I
[1:43:38] mean, they just really got into serving
[1:43:40] God, worshiping God while the kids were
[1:43:42] playing bingo in pingpong in the
[1:43:44] basement. My brother and sister, no way
[1:43:46] to lead your family in the presence of
[1:43:48] God. Amen. You're worshiping here and
[1:43:51] the devil's got your kids in the
[1:43:52] basement. No, my brother and sister,
[1:43:54] when the word says that the spirit and
[1:43:57] the bride say come, the bride is going
[1:44:00] to present the opportunity, the
[1:44:02] atmosphere that will draw the children,
[1:44:05] too. We don't need to sit here today and
[1:44:06] say, "Well, when our kids get to be 18
[1:44:09] or 20, maybe God will deal with them." I
[1:44:11] want God to come while they're still
[1:44:13] little toddlers. I want God to come
[1:44:15] while they're still not even
[1:44:17] comprehending totally what they're
[1:44:18] hearing. And I want God to anoint their
[1:44:20] little hearts to say, "You know what? I
[1:44:23] see by the word of God there's going to
[1:44:24] be a bride out of every nation, every
[1:44:27] kindred and tongue. And I'm not meaning
[1:44:28] to add to the word, but out of every age
[1:44:31] group.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether it be remember prophets
[1:44:36] there in that vision. Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I don't recognize her.
[1:44:43] I don't forget the age. Forgive me for
[1:44:45] not remembering. 90 years old. She comes
[1:44:48] to the Lord at 90 years old. Her life is
[1:44:51] close to over. Everything she's got
[1:44:53] promised in this earth is actually
[1:44:55] passed
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; and God saves her. Why would he leave
[1:44:59] her? If she's a daughter of God, why
[1:45:00] would he leave her till that point?
[1:45:03] Because God's going to prove
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; it's going to prove sovereign grace,
[1:45:07] sovereign word
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; is going to work. Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; My grace is sufficient.
[1:45:14] Remember
[1:45:15] the story of the soldier, World War I, I
[1:45:18] believe it was, maybe World War II, the
[1:45:20] man is dying
[1:45:23] and the chaplain or whatever comes to
[1:45:25] him.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And he goes, "I I don't I'm I'm afraid
[1:45:29] to die." And he says, "Well,
[1:45:31] go back to where you left him."
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; See, what happened? Here's a young man
[1:45:36] in war
[1:45:40] and he's laying there dying
[1:45:43] and he starts searching his life
[1:45:47] and suddenly he says as I lay me down to
[1:45:51] sleep.
[1:45:54] You see that atmosphere
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; was such that he left.
[1:46:02] If you've ever watched I I I actually
[1:46:04] watched this, pardon me for using
[1:46:06] terrible analogy.
[1:46:08] I was in the semi one time just north of
[1:46:10] Baker City, Oregon,
[1:46:12] and I'm passing another semi and I look
[1:46:15] over and the driver has an elbow on the
[1:46:20] window seal and an elbow on the steering
[1:46:24] wheel.
[1:46:29] and he looked over enough and I waved at
[1:46:31] him and he kind of
[1:46:40] went on by him, went to move back in the
[1:46:43] other lane
[1:46:45] and I watched what became a very slow
[1:46:47] drift.
[1:46:50] Went from the center line. That was one
[1:46:51] of the reasons I was concerned. He's
[1:46:52] driving down the center line and a very
[1:46:55] slow drift.
[1:46:58] I start hollering on the CB. Hey, hey,
[1:47:00] hey.
[1:47:04] Drives right off the freeway
[1:47:07] and truck just crashed and destroyed
[1:47:10] itself. Fortunately, the man didn't die.
[1:47:14] That's many people's spiritual walk.
[1:47:17] They become so doled by Leodysia,
[1:47:21] they start a drift.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Everything's okay. My family's still in
[1:47:24] church. Yeah.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know you yourself put it
[1:47:29] in there. Your family being in church,
[1:47:31] does that make them hot?
[1:47:34] Come on, let's be honest with ourselves.
[1:47:36] Does that make you hot cuz you're in
[1:47:37] church?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:40] Does it make you even lukewarm?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Could, but if you're still drifting,
[1:47:49] come on. Let's not use such thoughts.
[1:47:51] That's right.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; My family's in church.
[1:47:54] Let's be hot.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Let's find a purpose for what God's got
[1:47:58] us here. Okay, let me move on. So, we're
[1:48:01] talking now uh uh this experience will
[1:48:04] be things that they cannot even put. The
[1:48:06] bride of Christ won't even be able to
[1:48:07] put this into words. What happened?
[1:48:09] Remember the prophet's vision uh of the
[1:48:12] little room and they come out and they
[1:48:14] said, "What happened in there?" I don't
[1:48:15] know.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; And people thought, "Well, nothing must
[1:48:18] have happened if they don't know what
[1:48:20] happened." But I'm telling you, when God
[1:48:22] comes in your life and starts to deal
[1:48:23] with your life, things will change. And
[1:48:26] you won't know how they change. You'll
[1:48:28] just know something happened. Amen. We
[1:48:31] don't need to explain this gospel. We
[1:48:33] need to live it.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to accept it. Now, look in
[1:48:36] in Second John 1 1-8. We won't preach
[1:48:40] the whole thing, but I want to make this
[1:48:42] point.
[1:48:43] Um my somebody stole the time this
[1:48:46] morning.
[1:48:49] Must be we'll get a new pulpit and maybe
[1:48:51] it'll be better. Second John 1 1 uh 1
[1:48:55] 1-8. The elder and to the random lady
[1:48:59] and her children.
[1:49:02] No, my brother and sister, this lady is
[1:49:04] not random. She's elected
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; whom I love in the truth. And not I
[1:49:10] only, but also all they that have known
[1:49:12] the truth. So you look up the definition
[1:49:15] of election. It is a choice by vote. And
[1:49:18] so a vote, one vote, amen, God's vote,
[1:49:22] God's vote for you. And God is an
[1:49:24] unchangeable God. Same yesterday, today,
[1:49:26] and forever. So when God voted for you,
[1:49:29] Amen. He didn't go back a week later and
[1:49:31] say, "I guess I cast the wrong vote."
[1:49:33] Now we as that if you vote for a
[1:49:35] politician or something like that you
[1:49:38] know um you know maybe you'd want to go
[1:49:40] back in 6 months and say I I would like
[1:49:43] to change my vote but it's impossible to
[1:49:45] do. Amen. So you look at this says for
[1:49:48] truth's sake which dwelleth in us shall
[1:49:50] be with us
[1:49:53] forever.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Truth is not fading away. It's not being
[1:49:58] degraded. Grace be with you. mercy and
[1:50:01] peace from God the Father, the Lord
[1:50:02] Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, and
[1:50:05] truth in love. I rejoice greatly that I
[1:50:07] found of thy children walking in truth,
[1:50:10] as we have received a commandment from
[1:50:12] the Father. Now I beseech thee, Lady,
[1:50:15] not as though I wrote a new commandment
[1:50:17] unto thee, but that which we had from
[1:50:20] the beginning, that we shall love one
[1:50:21] another. And this is love, that we walk
[1:50:25] after his commandments. So people say,
[1:50:27] "I love the Lord," and live any way they
[1:50:29] want. They have a carnal understanding
[1:50:33] of love.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; They they don't have a a real spiritual
[1:50:37] understanding because they would be
[1:50:39] obedient to the word if they really
[1:50:42] loved him. Amen. That's not too hard to
[1:50:45] comprehend, is it? And so take this
[1:50:48] commandment that as ye have heard from
[1:50:50] the beginning, you should walk in it.
[1:50:51] For many deceivers are entered into the
[1:50:54] world who confess not that Jesus Christ
[1:50:56] has come in the flesh. This is a
[1:50:57] deceiver and an antichrist. Now this
[1:51:00] might throw you if you don't have any
[1:51:02] understanding. Look to yourselves.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; What does a comma do?
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It denotes a gap, a stop, a space,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; pause.
[1:51:18] Look to yourselves. Now, if we just
[1:51:21] preached a sermon, look to yourself,
[1:51:22] then people would be like, what's wrong
[1:51:24] with this guy? But you see, it's already
[1:51:28] Christ in you.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to look, if it was up to your
[1:51:32] flesh, the carnal person, you would have
[1:51:33] quit so long ago. It ain't funny. You
[1:51:35] wouldn't even be able to remember when
[1:51:36] you quit. You would have quit so long
[1:51:38] ago. So, you look to yourself and let's
[1:51:41] just stop and let's just recount in our
[1:51:43] own life what God has done for you, what
[1:51:45] he has come and and answered prayers and
[1:51:48] and changed circumstances and all of
[1:51:51] this is. So, look to yourself. You don't
[1:51:53] need to look to the preacher. You don't
[1:51:55] need to look to someone else. Look to
[1:51:57] yourself. What's God done for you?
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't find a single thing
[1:52:01] that God's done for you, then I I don't
[1:52:04] even know what to say. I don't know what
[1:52:05] to share with you if you can't find a
[1:52:08] single thing that God's done for you.
[1:52:10] But look to yourselves that we lose not
[1:52:12] those things which we have wrought.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; See what's happened. My brother and
[1:52:17] sister, I'll just be blunt with you this
[1:52:19] morning. Many a person and I know these
[1:52:21] people personally I would not divulge
[1:52:23] their name
[1:52:25] but they are sitting here today not
[1:52:26] serving God
[1:52:28] because they looked to what someone else
[1:52:31] said what someone else thought when
[1:52:33] someone else's opinion someone else why
[1:52:36] didn't they stop and look and say what
[1:52:38] has God done for me
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; I was a druggie I was an alcoholic I was
[1:52:42] a liar a cheating a thief an adulterer
[1:52:44] and God cleaned me up and took me in and
[1:52:46] called me his own if they would have
[1:52:48] just went back and look to themsself.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Not of their own ability, but to see
[1:52:55] Christ in them, right? That's the word.
[1:52:57] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Stop
[1:52:59] and just look to yourself. What has God
[1:53:01] done for me? And they would put the
[1:53:03] naysayer and all of those. They would
[1:53:06] just ignore them and put them off to the
[1:53:08] side. But somebody's like, "Well, the
[1:53:10] preacher said, the preacher did, the
[1:53:11] preacher this, the preacher that."
[1:53:13] What's the preacher got to do with it?
[1:53:15] He can't get you in and he can't kick
[1:53:17] you out.
[1:53:18] Amen. All he can do is bring the word to
[1:53:21] you and he's either bringing truth
[1:53:24] and you can stand on that and if he's
[1:53:26] not bringing truth then find another
[1:53:28] church.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; And if you don't want to find another
[1:53:31] church, get rid of the preacher and get
[1:53:33] one that will preach the truth to you.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Boy, but church splits are just horrible
[1:53:39] things. I never want to live through
[1:53:40] another one. Well, I'll tell you what,
[1:53:42] being lulled to sleep and fed to the
[1:53:45] wolves is not such a sweet experience
[1:53:47] either. That's right.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Well, they hold on eternal life.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; What does it do? It puts you in a
[1:53:55] position to receive. My brother and
[1:53:58] sister, we were there. Brother Luke, you
[1:53:59] know, he works with high voltage
[1:54:01] electricity
[1:54:03] last Sunday. It was there, you know, I
[1:54:05] went down there. Those of you here, you
[1:54:07] know what happens? Brother Luke is 440
[1:54:11] and I grab a hold of brother Luke. Amen.
[1:54:14] There's been many a case and it's a
[1:54:16] proven principle of electricity that
[1:54:17] there's been people that tried to jerk
[1:54:20] the person away from the electricity and
[1:54:22] the guy with the hold electricity
[1:54:23] doesn't get shocked as bad as the guy
[1:54:25] that was on the end.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while he's trying to rescue
[1:54:30] him, see how Satan works?
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; He follows the same principle God's got.
[1:54:35] Amen. I'm here. I want to be a conduit.
[1:54:38] I spoke this last Sunday. I want to be a
[1:54:40] conduit to you. But my brother and
[1:54:42] sister, I want that conduit to be filled
[1:54:44] with the Holy Ghost. I want it to not be
[1:54:46] fleshly things, carnal things, brother
[1:54:48] deals, you know, uh multi-level
[1:54:50] marketing things, and and just, you
[1:54:53] know, conduit down through this. No, I
[1:54:55] want it to be Jesus Christ, the same
[1:54:56] yesterday, today, and forever flowing
[1:54:59] right down. And may it be as it were,
[1:55:02] that the one that you're holding on to
[1:55:04] out here, uh, receives also. That's
[1:55:07] right.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; We're not in this just for oursel. We're
[1:55:09] in for the word to come down to it. And
[1:55:12] it's there that God's looking for those
[1:55:13] that are faithful. Because when people
[1:55:15] are faithful, God can bless them and
[1:55:18] know what kind of result he'll get.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; can I have a couple more minutes?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Couple in farmer talk is anywhere from
[1:55:30] 10 minutes to two hours.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're all still good.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Jerry knows. She told me
[1:55:38] one time I come home. I told her I'll be
[1:55:40] home in a few minutes. I come home a
[1:55:42] couple hours later and I said, "Hey
[1:55:44] honey, where's supper?" She says, "Well,
[1:55:46] I've got a revelation. This might not be
[1:55:48] the exact words." And I said, "What's
[1:55:50] that?" You like cold food. I put it in
[1:55:52] the fridge.
[1:55:54] So, you know, I don't mean it to be
[1:55:57] funny, but look, let's just move on
[1:55:59] here. So, correct position in essence is
[1:56:03] everything.
[1:56:05] I want you to think about this for a
[1:56:06] second.
[1:56:08] This word misapplied.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Circa church in the 70s. I'm going to
[1:56:17] give you the word test. If you don't get
[1:56:20] 100% on it, you're serpent seed.
[1:56:24] Misapplied.
[1:56:26] Horribly misapplied.
[1:56:29] When it should have been applied, eat
[1:56:31] this book,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; right? And if you'll eat this book and
[1:56:35] keep eating this book, it will save your
[1:56:39] soul.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what happened was it was a
[1:56:44] 100% as it would be in or you're 100%
[1:56:47] out. Well, I would have been 100% out. I
[1:56:50] have to tell you the truth. It took
[1:56:52] years for God dealing with me. Years of
[1:56:54] struggle and and trying and failing and
[1:56:58] wanting to but not achieving. Anybody
[1:57:01] know what I'm talking about?
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; And so you look at this. See, we come in
[1:57:05] a time. We come in a place that God
[1:57:07] sometimes works quite slow. I don't
[1:57:10] know. I couldn't tell you. I could
[1:57:11] figure it out, but I couldn't tell you
[1:57:13] right now how old Jacob was. But Jacob
[1:57:15] was born a suppler.
[1:57:18] And until he reached that age that he
[1:57:20] wrestled with the angel, he was a
[1:57:22] suppler all the way to that moment.
[1:57:25] Must have been serpent seed up to that
[1:57:27] day.
[1:57:29] Must have been of the devil up to that
[1:57:31] day right there. No sir, the word would
[1:57:34] show you he always was a son of God.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; God just changed his desire and brought
[1:57:40] it to a place that focused on him. Now
[1:57:44] correct positioning. Let me get focused.
[1:57:46] It's essence of everything. Now look,
[1:57:49] Brother Brandham, if you guys remember a
[1:57:51] vision brother Brandham had that he goes
[1:57:54] and it's at a it's at a house and uh
[1:57:59] there's this baby that's sick
[1:58:01] and there's all these individuals
[1:58:04] and a neighbor and a mother-in-law or a
[1:58:07] mother, grandmother, whatever. Sorry,
[1:58:11] I'm should have this. My brain just went
[1:58:13] foggy.
[1:58:15] So, Brother Brown sees all this and he's
[1:58:18] going to go pray for the baby
[1:58:22] and he realizes
[1:58:25] this lady's missing.
[1:58:28] But here she comes, sees out the window.
[1:58:31] She's come coming down the path.
[1:58:35] She comes in the house and then he's I'm
[1:58:38] going to pray. But God shows him.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Not everything in its correct position.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll let me to turn this a
[1:58:48] little bit. You got your Bible. You read
[1:58:50] your Bible. You believe your Bible. But
[1:58:52] what's in the Bible's got to be in its
[1:58:54] correct position.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; If it's not in the correct position, you
[1:59:00] can read it. You can claim it. You can
[1:59:02] tell the devil to leave you alone until
[1:59:04] you got no breath in your body and then
[1:59:07] say, "This doesn't work." Because my
[1:59:10] brother and sister, God wants you to put
[1:59:12] it in position. That's right.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Not some random I I went out and I
[1:59:16] partied all night and now I'm having
[1:59:18] nightmares. Devil leave me alone. My
[1:59:20] brother and sister, you can't go flirt
[1:59:22] with the devil and not expect him to go
[1:59:24] home with you.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; You want to have something in peace in
[1:59:29] your home, then you bring peace into
[1:59:31] your home. It doesn't just show up.
[1:59:34] That's right. I hope that didn't offend
[1:59:36] anybody, but I'm telling you, if you
[1:59:38] don't have peace in your home, you have
[1:59:40] to create the atmosphere that puts peace
[1:59:44] in your home.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown praying for the child
[1:59:49] and everything's done. And then he looks
[1:59:52] over there and by God's grace, he
[1:59:53] recognizes, you know, that hat's not in
[1:59:55] its right position. And and uh she's
[1:59:58] here, grandmother, whatever is here, but
[2:00:00] it's not in the right position. and and
[2:00:03] the Lord just calms him and he steps
[2:00:04] back from that. And then pretty soon the
[2:00:07] hat gets picked up and gets put on top
[2:00:10] of the stove, the furnace over here. And
[2:00:12] that person shifted around and went and
[2:00:14] sat in the right sea. And then the
[2:00:16] prophet of God knew that that vision
[2:00:18] that God had showed him of that baby
[2:00:20] being healed was perfectly in the
[2:00:24] picture. Perfectly, as brother David
[2:00:26] just said, in time. It was just what it
[2:00:28] was supposed to be. Now I want to say my
[2:00:30] brother and sister hopefully I don't cut
[2:00:32] you too hard this morning. Take this
[2:00:34] right here. This is your vision for a
[2:00:37] Leo to see an age. This is your vision.
[2:00:40] It must be put in its correct position
[2:00:44] if you expect God to honor your prayer
[2:00:47] and to answer you. Now you say, "But
[2:00:49] I've got some things out of order in my
[2:00:50] life and God's still doing that." That's
[2:00:52] right. He's showing you he hears your
[2:00:54] voice. He's showing you that he cares
[2:00:57] for you. But it's time get it in its
[2:00:59] right position.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Let it be the preeminent thing in our
[2:01:02] home.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] So the washing of the water of the word
[2:01:08] is preparing the bride to receive more
[2:01:10] word.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? We know John 1, he is the
[2:01:14] word. Now
[2:01:18] I'm sure glad I expressed that couple
[2:01:22] minutes.
[2:01:24] Revelations 19. And I heard as it were a
[2:01:27] voice of a great multitude and a voice
[2:01:29] of many waters and as a voice of mighty
[2:01:31] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[2:01:32] Lord God omnipotent reigns. Let us be
[2:01:35] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[2:01:37] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[2:01:39] and his wife have made herself ready.
[2:01:42] See this is the process we're in right
[2:01:43] now. His wife not girlfriend.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; See there's already been a vow taken.
[2:01:49] There's already been a betrothel taken.
[2:01:51] Amen. And this is what's happening my
[2:01:53] brother and sister. It's not, oh, uh,
[2:01:55] the marriage ceremony, the minute you
[2:01:58] make the commitment, you're considered.
[2:02:01] So, see what God's doing? God is
[2:02:03] bringing you and I to this place right
[2:02:05] now where we are here and we're saying,
[2:02:07] Lord, I'm going to serve you. You say,
[2:02:08] "But we haven't met at the marriage
[2:02:11] supper of the lamb that comes after."
[2:02:13] The supper comes after. Supper doesn't
[2:02:15] come before. Supper comes after. Amen.
[2:02:18] And so it's there that his wife, Amen,
[2:02:22] he's making a claim to her and to her
[2:02:25] was granted that she should be araided
[2:02:26] in fine linen, clean and white, tying
[2:02:28] that back to the white stone. Amen.
[2:02:31] These things all come together. There's
[2:02:32] a purity there. So she is coming by the
[2:02:35] blood of the lamb. Amen. She is in fine
[2:02:38] linen, pure.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; For fine linen is the righteousness of
[2:02:44] saints. And he saith unto me, write,
[2:02:46] blessed are they which are called unto
[2:02:47] the marriage supper of the lamb. And he
[2:02:49] saith unto me, these are the true
[2:02:51] sayings of God. What is it? Let me just
[2:02:53] sum this and move quickly. Perfect, pure
[2:02:57] revelation. Not one single word added,
[2:03:00] not single word taken away. Perfect
[2:03:03] revelation.
[2:03:05] And so the lamb's wife, where does she
[2:03:07] receive her new name?
[2:03:10] Not from the church.
[2:03:14] might offend some of you. She doesn't
[2:03:16] even receive it from a prophet.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; She receives it from her husband.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; There's where she receives her new name.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; No new name's going to come just because
[2:03:27] you went to a message church.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; No new name come because you're a a
[2:03:32] follower of brother so and so's
[2:03:33] ministry. Amen. Now, if you understand
[2:03:36] what I would say here, there's not going
[2:03:38] to be a hyphenated bride in heaven.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:03:42] Amen. My name is Mrs. Le oysia bride.
[2:03:46] Nope. Nope. I'm sorry. No hyphenations.
[2:03:49] You're either the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:50] or you're of Leodysia.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; One of the two. That plane. Amen. And we
[2:03:55] will receive and take on the name he's
[2:03:58] given us. Now, let me read this and then
[2:04:00] we'll be then we'll be almost done.
[2:04:08] It's not funny, but I just find myself.
[2:04:15] Let me just move on. I'll just move on
[2:04:17] to the very next one. Amen. Go to that.
[2:04:20] Go to the next one out of the church
[2:04:22] age.
[2:04:23] So
[2:04:28] the next one also
[2:04:32] little too much here.
[2:04:34] Now then there is also the thought of
[2:04:36] the future partaking of the hidden mana.
[2:04:38] Right? They're in revelation. Those are
[2:04:40] partaking of the hidden mana. I think it
[2:04:42] will be eternal partaking of the
[2:04:44] revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[2:04:46] eternal ages to come. How else could we
[2:04:48] begin to know the uncarchable riches of
[2:04:51] his own being? All that we have longed
[2:04:54] to know. Now look at this. I've had
[2:04:56] people ask me this question. Will we
[2:04:59] will we anything change? Will we know
[2:05:01] more in heaven? Right? Here's the
[2:05:02] answer.
[2:05:03] All that we begin to know the
[2:05:05] uncarchable riches of his own being.
[2:05:09] All that we have longed to know, all our
[2:05:11] unanswered questions, all that will be
[2:05:14] revealed. It will be from Christ who is
[2:05:17] our life that we receive it. Oh,
[2:05:19] sometimes we think we get to know a
[2:05:22] little of him and his word down here and
[2:05:24] is so good and it makes us rejoice. But
[2:05:27] one day when our flesh changes that word
[2:05:29] and he will become what we had never
[2:05:32] dreamed possible.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What we never dreamed possible
[2:05:39] will be an understanding to see how it
[2:05:43] was. My brother and sister I want you to
[2:05:46] think about this. Before the foundation
[2:05:48] of the world, God was there. He writes
[2:05:51] your name on the lamb's book of life.
[2:05:54] And we think, "Okay, okay, that's that's
[2:05:57] cool. I'm not sure how that works." But
[2:05:59] did you realize he didn't wait an eon of
[2:06:03] time? I'll put it that way because I
[2:06:05] have no idea how much time that was. He
[2:06:07] doesn't wait and then pull you off the
[2:06:09] page and send you out. When he wrote
[2:06:14] your name, when he spoke your name,
[2:06:18] we've preached it here in the church,
[2:06:19] but just let me give a little refresher.
[2:06:21] as a Jewish mother would give birth or
[2:06:23] any mother uh that'd be and as they're
[2:06:26] in the process of giving birth, "Thank
[2:06:29] you, Lord, I'm a man." Um, but they
[2:06:33] would cry out a name.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; And that was a name given to that child.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; The scripture types this in that same
[2:06:41] context that God spoke. Put your name in
[2:06:44] here. I don't mean to be selfish, but
[2:06:46] I'll put my own name so I don't offend
[2:06:48] anybody. spoke Paul Halelet. It was a
[2:06:52] birth pain.
[2:06:54] Listen to the sermon birth pains. It was
[2:06:56] a birth pain.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; It didn't just like Paul Hale.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; It was a birth pain.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Imagine the birth pains our Lord Jesus
[2:07:04] Christ went through. That's Paul Hale.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And then he writes that name down in the
[2:07:12] book in his own precious blood. You
[2:07:16] realize that put you out here? Oh, you
[2:07:19] mean we just floated around out here in
[2:07:20] the heavens somewhere and just appeared
[2:07:22] on earth? No. God had This is such
[2:07:25] amazing about how what God is and what
[2:07:27] he does. God run a genealogy. We look at
[2:07:30] anybody who ever run your genealogy.
[2:07:32] Amen. I kind of did kind of
[2:07:34] half-hearted, you know, enough to get
[2:07:37] disappointed. Um, but look, he says,
[2:07:41] "This is going to be my daughter. She's
[2:07:45] going to receive the word. She's going
[2:07:46] to say amen to the word. She's going to
[2:07:48] stand for the word. She's going to live
[2:07:49] the word. She's going to be the word.
[2:07:52] And this is her parents and this is
[2:07:54] their parents and this is grandparents
[2:07:56] and this is this. And he goes back and
[2:07:58] if you've looked at a genealogy chart,
[2:08:00] it just goes,
[2:08:03] you don't think that's amazing that God
[2:08:05] would call your name and write you on
[2:08:07] the Lamb's book of life and put every
[2:08:10] circumstance and every life and
[2:08:12] everything together to come down and
[2:08:15] bring the word. And then a mother has a
[2:08:17] baby and she holds it in her arms
[2:08:21] and said,
[2:08:24] "I'll call him Paul."
[2:08:28] Come on, tell me you don't serve an
[2:08:31] awesome God.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; A God that the word is so incredible. He
[2:08:36] cares so much for you. He put all that
[2:08:38] together
[2:08:39] to bring you to this place. And you tell
[2:08:41] me he can't bring you
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; right
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; through your circumstance.
[2:08:46] He can't bring you through those things,
[2:08:47] those things that Satan wants to stumble
[2:08:50] you over. You're saying you don't think
[2:08:52] God can bring you through that.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. You're so underestimating your
[2:08:58] God. In fact, that is so radical it
[2:09:01] might be just considered unbelief.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hopefully that didn't offend you either.
[2:09:07] Amen. So,
[2:09:11] let me find myself.
[2:09:14] Move on to that next piece if you would,
[2:09:16] brother Alex.
[2:09:20] Oh, go back.
[2:09:23] He gave me the look like what are you
[2:09:24] where you going?
[2:09:27] So, it says he's going to give the
[2:09:28] overcomer a white stone in not on whit
[2:09:31] stone a new name which the owner alone
[2:09:34] knows. Now, the idea of a new name is a
[2:09:36] familiar one. Abra was changed to
[2:09:38] Abraham. Sarahi to Sarah, Jacob to
[2:09:40] Israel, Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul,
[2:09:43] these names either brought about a
[2:09:45] change or were given because of a
[2:09:49] change. Look, when you get there and he
[2:09:52] gives to you a new name, it's not going
[2:09:56] to be you, the old man that is there,
[2:10:00] but it's going to be the new creation
[2:10:02] that is going to receive the new name
[2:10:05] because there has been a change. Now,
[2:10:08] look at how brother Brandham puts this.
[2:10:10] They brought about a change or were
[2:10:13] given because of change.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:18] H
[2:10:20] I know I'm long here, so I just I'll
[2:10:22] hold these thoughts. It was only after
[2:10:24] Abraham and Sarah had their names
[2:10:25] changed by the Lord that they were made
[2:10:27] ready to receive the coming son. So
[2:10:30] there it was a change brought the son.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look at this. In Jacob's case,
[2:10:35] he had to overcome and then he was
[2:10:39] called.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. A prince. In the case of Simon and
[2:10:43] Saul, when they had received the Lord,
[2:10:45] their change came. And today each one of
[2:10:48] us true believers has had a change in
[2:10:51] name. Now look at this. We are
[2:10:53] Christians. So we could settle for that
[2:10:55] and say, "Oh, our new name is we are
[2:10:57] Christians." But that's just a glimpse
[2:11:00] of what God is bringing about to name a
[2:11:03] new name. We give you a new name. It's a
[2:11:06] name common to all of us. But we already
[2:11:08] have in the word. Amen. A name that will
[2:11:12] only be known by the one who receives
[2:11:14] it. So it can't be a common name.
[2:11:16] It can't be common. But one day we will
[2:11:19] have another change. We will of a
[2:11:21] certainty receive a new name. It could
[2:11:23] well be that name that was our true and
[2:11:26] original name written in the lamb's book
[2:11:29] of life from the foundation of the
[2:11:30] world. Imagine this. So your mama, your
[2:11:33] daddy names you whatever. I'm going to
[2:11:35] use there's no Agnes's here today, are
[2:11:37] there? We'll use Agnes. Mama names you
[2:11:40] Agnes. Amen. And and you know, you grow
[2:11:42] up and you don't like the name Agnes,
[2:11:44] but you know, you just live with it
[2:11:46] because that's what they named you. And
[2:11:48] then you'll find one day that God had an
[2:11:50] entirely different name for you.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; So the name you disliked your whole life
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; turned out not to be your real name.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:12:03] Those of you that don't like your name,
[2:12:05] that should give you hope.
[2:12:08] should give you peace that you're not
[2:12:10] going to have to go through eternity
[2:12:12] named Agnes.
[2:12:14] But God has a name for you. Now, I don't
[2:12:18] make light of that because I knew a lady
[2:12:20] was like a grandmother to me named
[2:12:22] Agnes. And if everyone was like her,
[2:12:27] it wouldn't matter what you named her.
[2:12:30] She was a saint.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Have another change. A true original
[2:12:35] name written in the lamb's book of life.
[2:12:38] He knows the name but we do not.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; One day at his good pleasure we will
[2:12:43] know also.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us be aware
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; that you right now
[2:12:50] as sons of daughters of God are
[2:12:52] possessing a new name.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you receive it, praise
[2:12:57] God. We don't need to get in a hurry. We
[2:12:59] don't need to try and come up with a
[2:13:00] revelation that we've got the new name.
[2:13:03] Just let God reveal it to you in its
[2:13:05] season.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're an overcomer,
[2:13:11] you will receive.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; A new name.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm apologizing but not for being
[2:13:19] a little long.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; But look at this, saints. How beautiful
[2:13:22] it is that God would come and be so
[2:13:24] mindful of us. All that matters to me
[2:13:28] whether my name was meant to be Paul on
[2:13:30] the lamb's book of life or it's another
[2:13:32] name just as long as my name is in the
[2:13:36] lamb's book of life that's what matters
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; amen and that is a gift of God to you
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; if he put your name there and I don't
[2:13:46] say if as a question mark when he put
[2:13:49] your name there amen he made it possible
[2:13:54] for you to achieve accomplish
[2:13:58] all of the synonyms that go with that
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; to be there and finish that work. Amen.
[2:14:04] Can someone say thank you, Lord?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ruth, would you come?
[2:14:08] Hallelujah. I say, my brother and
[2:14:10] sister, I hope that maybe the Lord
[2:14:12] blessed you a little bit today. This has
[2:14:14] just been something on my heart.
[2:14:15] Something just looking at that, it's
[2:14:18] like, wow, we can turn this into a
[2:14:20] doctrine or we can turn it into reality.
[2:14:22] I think I'll just settle for the reality
[2:14:24] that God has got a new name for me and
[2:14:27] when I stand before him as an overcomer
[2:14:29] one day. Amen. And we stand there before
[2:14:31] the throne of God and he reveals what we
[2:14:34] were. Imagine how big this picture is.
[2:14:37] Now remember my brother and sister this
[2:14:40] genealogy.
[2:14:42] I want you to realize just as a promises
[2:14:45] to Abram
[2:14:47] becoming Abraham,
[2:14:49] the sands on the seashore.
[2:14:52] Imagine if God come and started stirring
[2:14:54] the sands
[2:14:56] and laid out your whole life story from
[2:15:00] the beginning
[2:15:03] to the end.
[2:15:05] It would be so incredible there'd be no
[2:15:08] way for you to even comprehend.
[2:15:11] Say, "But but how could this be? How
[2:15:14] could No. The same God who wrote you in
[2:15:18] the Lamb's Book of Life and made it
[2:15:20] possible for you to fulfill that word is
[2:15:23] the same God who's hanging the earth in
[2:15:27] orbit."
[2:15:29] Brother Isaac shared a little deal with
[2:15:31] me. They're thinking they're going to
[2:15:32] have to uh change the atomic clock
[2:15:35] because time is speeding up.
[2:15:40] It was something on the order of some
[2:15:42] 10,000th part of a nancond.
[2:15:46] How can they even measure that?
[2:15:48] I don't know if that's a fulfillment of
[2:15:50] scripture that he would shorten the
[2:15:53] time. I don't care. Time's in his hand
[2:15:58] and I'm in his hand. So whatever it is,
[2:16:02] he's going to fulfill it in you. Amen.
[2:16:05] Hallelujah.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:08] Oh my.
[2:16:10] Let's just stand if you would please.
[2:16:16] Hallelujah.
[2:16:18] 712. Brother Alex. Amen. And then we'll
[2:16:22] just ask our brother Isaac to come and
[2:16:24] lead us in a song.
[2:16:27] Amen.
[2:16:30] be it unto me.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Whatever the word is, just receive it.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Don't put up a offense. I disagree. I
[2:16:37] don't feel. I don't understand. Just
[2:16:39] say, Lord, whatever the word is, let it
[2:16:42] be in me.
[2:16:47] Be unto me,
[2:16:52] oh according to your word. According
[2:17:00] to your promises
[2:17:05] I can stand
[2:17:08] secure.
[2:17:12] of upon my heart
[2:17:17] all the truth that sets me free
[2:17:23] according to your word. Oh Lord,
[2:17:30] be it unto me.
[2:17:35] Oh be unto me.
[2:17:41] Oh, according to your word,
[2:17:48] according to your promises,
[2:17:54] I will stand
[2:17:56] secure.
[2:17:59] Oh, you carved upon my heart.
[2:18:05] Oh, the truth that set me free.
[2:18:11] and according to your word, O Lord,
[2:18:18] be it unto
[2:18:21] me.
[2:18:24] Be it unto me
[2:18:30] according to your word,
[2:18:36] according to your promises
[2:18:42] I can stand
[2:18:44] secure.
[2:18:48] Carve upon my heart
[2:18:53] the truth that sets me free
[2:19:00] according to your word, O Lord,
[2:19:06] be it unto me.
[2:19:11] You're playing first there.
[2:19:16] I have a man.
[2:19:21] I have a maker.
[2:19:26] [Music]
[2:19:28] He formed
[2:19:30] my heart.
[2:19:34] And before even time began,
[2:19:40] life was in his hand.
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:48] He knows my name.
[2:19:54] He knows my every thought.
[2:20:01] He sees each tear that falls
[2:20:06] and hears me when I call.
[2:20:11] [Music]
[2:20:14] I have a father.
[2:20:21] He calls me his own.
[2:20:27] And he'll never
[2:20:30] leave me.
[2:20:33] No matter
[2:20:35] where I go,
[2:20:40] he knows my name.
[2:20:47] He knows my every thought.
[2:20:53] He sees each tear that falls
[2:20:59] and hears me when I call.
[2:21:06] I have a father.
[2:21:12] He calls me his own.
[2:21:19] And he'll never
[2:21:21] leave me.
[2:21:24] No matter
[2:21:26] where I go,
[2:21:31] he knows my name.
[2:21:38] He knows my every thought.
[2:21:44] He sees each tear that falls
[2:21:49] and hears me when I call.
[2:21:56] Amen.
[2:21:58] Amen. You know, I took a psychology
[2:22:01] class years ago and one of the two
[2:22:04] things they say, you know, every human
[2:22:06] needs is place and purpose.
[2:22:09] I have a father. He calls me his own. I
[2:22:12] have place and he's given me purpose.
[2:22:14] Hallelujah.
[2:22:16] Amen. Amen. A song that uh
[2:22:20] who I am, Lord, who I am.
[2:22:25] Amen.
[2:22:28] Oh, glorious victory. Amen.
[2:22:33] Oh, glorious victory.
[2:22:38] That day he set me free.
[2:22:42] And he made my heart
[2:22:47] his very throne.
[2:22:51] My life is no longer mine.
[2:22:56] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[2:23:00] And now I live
[2:23:04] to praise his name.
[2:23:10] Who I am, Lord.
[2:23:14] Who I am.
[2:23:19] I can see now
[2:23:23] who I am.
[2:23:27] Part of my Savior,
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:32] part of his words.
[2:23:36] It's a revelation.
[2:23:38] [Music]
[2:23:40] of who I am.
[2:23:45] On Calvary,
[2:23:47] he died
[2:23:49] to redeem his lost bride,
[2:23:54] the King of Kings,
[2:23:58] became my savior.
[2:24:03] This is God's great mystery
[2:24:07] of love expressed to me
[2:24:12] that Christ and I
[2:24:16] might be made one.
[2:24:21] Who I am, Lord.
[2:24:25] Who I am.
[2:24:30] I can see now
[2:24:34] who I am.
[2:24:38] A part of my Savior,
[2:24:43] part of his word.
[2:24:47] It's a revelation
[2:24:51] of who I am.
[2:24:56] Amen. Turn around, shake hands with one
[2:24:59] another. Let's just sing this chorus one
[2:25:00] more time as we're dismissed.
[2:25:03] Who I am, Lord.
[2:25:08] Who I am.
[2:25:12] I can see now
[2:25:17] who I am.
[2:25:21] Part of my savior,
[2:25:25] part of his word.
[2:25:30] It's a revelation
[2:25:34] of who I am.
[2:25:37] God bless you.
[2:25:39] [Music]
