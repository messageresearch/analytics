i know [Music] who holds my hand amen's brother paul comes to sing he is here hallelujah [Music] he is here [Music] his holy name he is here just listen closely hear him you can touch him you will never be the same can we say amen to that this morning hallelujah never the same all the things of our life you just see everything change around you and while the world my brother and sister has become more attractive and the reason it is because it appeals entirely to the flesh so it's there that we have realized that that is satan's tactic in the day that we live in trying to appeal to the flesh make the flesh so happy that it won't think about the soul until it's too late oh my well i want to bring uh today greetings from brother manasseh he sent me a lovely text this morning sister sophie you got such a lovely son i love him so much he just woke up this morning he shared with me and just felt led to open his bible and open to ephesians 2 and he said he got really excited amen i'll tell you what just god is good and so let's continue to lift our brother manasseh up in prayer i know you know god allows us to enjoy the good things of life i know that he loves soccer amen and you know they've they've put that often into the future so i tried to encourage him that now's the time just one spiritually dig in dig into the school work the soccer that part of his life will come back if the lord wills in the spring just not getting in politics but according to some people who want to run our country we'll never enjoy those things again if they have the authority so you know that's fine that's fine because they're not in control god is amen so just remember brother manasseh amen also in contact this week with brother rohr sister mona up in north idaho they send their greetings to you saints they thoroughly enjoyed themselves when they were down for a visit trying to figure out how to come down soon and just ask for your prayers for their family the little group up there that god would just continue to move in their midst i want to speak to you once again on redemption's manifestation and my topic or title this morning would be this is our season amen now before we do that i have a little something if the brothers have that ready to those of you that have been thank you to our musicians what a blessing uh to those of you who have been on the church whoops what's app you will see this was posted and i think it's a very informative thing now my brother and sister we're not basing our salvation our faith in god on what man's discovery is but you will find that man's discoveries will prove that god is here and he is in control so if the brothers can play that if they'll just pop that up maybe i don't know do we need to turn a light off or will that show up well enough there was a recent study by the center for bible engagement where they pulled forty thousand uh the general population in the u.s from eight to eighty and they just wanted to see how we are engaging with scripture right and they discovered something that actually became kind of the profound discovery of the entire study they weren't even looking for this and this just kind of became the highlighted study right um when we're in the scripture one time a week and that could be church on something that's pastor saying you open your bible you hear the message one time a week had negligible effect on some tears really so i'm going to spell it out more here in a moment two times a week negligible effect now three times a week there was a blip on the map like there was a heartbeat something happened again a heartbeat but here was a profound discovery when we're in a scripture four times a week it literally spikes but it was literally one two three four something radically happens to this extent anger issues drop 32 uh bitterness in relationships marriage a relationship with your kids and so on drops 40 alcoholism drops 57 feelings spiritually stagnant you know if there was one area when i'm talking with people that that they'll be honest about is they just feel spiritually stagnant ask them a question how much time do you spend in the scripture if they're in the scripture four times a week or more it drops sixty percent while viewing pornography drops sixty one percent that's very important now on a flip positive side sharing your faith jumps two hundred percent wow because you have a confidence and then discipling others just two or three percent that's that's amazing so now what happens if you pray and read your bible seven days a week you see even science will testify of the word of god amen i just thought you would find that interesting just you know something that might stir your mind as you say well what can i do to have a better relationship with the lord well just pick up your bible start reading it it will change everything and then the prophet of god declared that prayer changes even everything so imagine between reading our bible and praying what effect we can have on our own life upon our family upon our church upon the community around us amen let's just stand as we go into the word today just once again greet our visitors and uh brother scott his family amen and uh so that's uh good to have him here uh sister kristen has uh just been overjoyed to have her dad here and and that's that's beautiful amen let's turn in our bibles to second samuel the 21st 22nd chapter verses one through four and uh we'll just go forward this morning amen saints i i make this as a bit of humor so uh hopefully the humor doesn't uh bother you but i shrunk the plate down further but found that i stacked it higher so i'm not sure where we're at today so uh you know just a lovely time to to uh do that you know if you want a natural example of that i don't know if any of you ever go down here to the mongolian barbecue just on the boulevard down here but they have different size bowls there and and sister jerry and i started eating there several years ago on occasion and you know you fill your bowl up you go and by the time they cook it it seems a lot less and then we saw the masters of the mongolian come in and they start with a bowl full and then they use things to build the shoulder and then they build it out a little further they build it out a little further and then they pile it up and the next thing you know they were posting a sign there that uh the food should not exceed four inches above your bowl and uh so you know i kind of took a lesson from that and so it doesn't matter the size of the bowl i hope you catch this and it doesn't matter what size a bowl you have it's how full you desire to fill it amen so you can take their their normal bowl and get enough in it that you have to take leftovers home or you can just let it be what it is ii samuel 22 1-4 and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul now you find it interesting that he doesn't lump saul in as an enemy but soul certainly was someone to be delivered from and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my savior now saves me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised now saints in the writing of this you could put parentheses around that because this is making an emphatic point because you could eliminate those words who is worthy to be praised out of it it wouldn't change the context over all of the sentence i will call on the lord so shall i be saved from mine enemies but you see it's making a point that i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised not just a call on the lord that's a solution to my problem but it's telling that it is worthy to be praised hallelujah thank you lord ask for your guiding hand today lord bless your saints i pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated and we look at this scripture today i want to use this in a context leading us up into a position to realize the season that we live in now my brother and sister i find it interesting that you can have a political analyst looking at the situation and when i say political it's more geo political than it is actual politics but looking at that and their analysis is that this thing that's happening in the united states has been festering below the surface for many years and it just took the right time and the right event uh to take place and uh it has broke to the surface now we're not here to discuss the uh social aspect or the racial aspect we're here as sons and daughters of god to dig into the word and to take what the word is but my brother and sister as we'll touch on here in a little bit we'll realize that everything has a season and i believe ecclesiastes when he says that everything there is a season so we'll look at the season of the time that is there and we're seeing how an unrest is coming upon the nation and how these things the stage has been set many years ago and as we'll look at this we'll recognize with a little spiritual discernment how that these things must come to pass for the word of god to come to full fruition and so it's in that you know it it just breaks our heart to to see a such a behavior in our nation but yet my brother and sister as i said it is something we must recognize must come to pass there must be a complete selling out to our lord jesus christ and there must be a complete selling out to the things of this world and so as you look at that there is a real move upon the land to change the face of our nation and those many of them are are i would believe innocently promoting something they don't really know the power that they are calling to be unleashed there it's right there below the surface this is the scripture tells us that the antichrist spirit is waiting for the season the the correct time a book of revelation lays it out so clearly and as you look at that you realize my brother and sister as we've been talking about that some are are there the middle wall of partition has been taken down some are pressing into the presence of god and because there's only two spirits in the framework of the church some are pressing into satan's synagogue and so it is that as they press into that i believe that they don't even realize what they are pressing into now as we've had with the older uh young people uh in these last couple friday youth meetings uh looking at music and how it all ties together some of that my brother and sister is just you know even at my age you look at it and it's just stunning to realize how that satan has captured the heart of generations by music and so we'll find that he's just constantly using that because it brings up something in the realm uh that is uh god created in humanity and we can enter in it's an open door into the spirit but yet if that will draw people to actually worship the devil and and enter into those things how much more will a godly atmosphere draw sons and daughters of god into the presence of almighty god so everything has a season and i thank god that by the grace that he has bestowed upon us that he said that he would reveal himself to us he would lead us he would guide us and i'm going to take the words of another man my brother and sister you may not feel how many of us like to feel all of us we're human we may not feel like god is here but he said he would be and his promise is just as powerful as his presence if he said i'll be with you i will lead you and guide you then you in your worst day the wheels fall off the wagon you can stop and say thank you lord for being here but the human element gets anointed we say where's god well if you will acknowledge and call on him he said when you draw nigh to me i draw an eye to you so we don't have to go by our feeling we can go by the promise amen and his promises have never failed and so we stand on that no matter how i feel amen i know that god is with me amen these are beautiful words as we read this my brother and sister and recognize here that uh david's words they're beautiful words as he is declaring the god of my rock amen it's not another god it's not some god not a part-time god but he's the god of the whole rock amen and him i'll trust and you know each and every day the lord is delivering us from the spirits of the age that we live in now if we didn't believe that my brother and sister then we would be on such a roller coaster we would be up one day praising god for saving us and the next day we would be purchasing a ticket going straight to hades but you see god's not a god of a roller coaster he's a god that starts down here at this basic beginning of our life when we recognize we can't live without him and he builds us up every single day now some would say well you know the lord just kind of tore up my life i had to go repent i had to change a lot of things you know technically now i i know this is a little bit opinion i don't directly have scripture if there is scripture for it to back this up but did you know that when god is tearing you down he's actually building you up god does not tear down like the world tears down god does not tear down like satan tears down god dismantles to the point that he hits solid rock again and he builds from there so it's never a plan just to tear down god's always got a plan to build it up but sometimes he has to take some of that old nature from us now i know that he's not really talking about you but people like you that have a nature that sometimes things poke you and you respond in such a way amen we're all saved filled with the holy ghost we never get upset but see that old nature amen you have to kill him every day oh hallelujah it's not hey i got rid of that you know 40 years ago no my brother and sister if you don't acknowledge the very fact that that nature is right there then the nature has overcome you to such a degree that you don't recognize that the nature possesses you so it's a battle that we face every day now so the lord is delivering us from the spirit of the enemy of the age that we live in and my brother and sister as we'll look through the word of god i want you to look at this now god gives directives to us and when he gives us a directive he puts an absolute in place uh acts 2 38 would be a very uh a direct directive uh repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and so he doesn't uh give that but if we're not careful we take the directives that god has given and we turn them into suggestions amen and so here it is now this deliverance that he's given he gives us a directive putting an absolute in place in verse 4 once again to back up to that he says i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies this directive shows us very clearly if we call he will save us amen that's beautiful hallelujah it don't matter what kind of doctrine or background or age that is involved if we call on the lord amen he will come amen now we look at this and many times we take the directives of the word of god we turn them into suggestions oh my brother and sister you say well brother paul what do you mean by that well we'll touch on that in just a little bit but my brother and sister a directive is an official or authoritative instruction it has come from one in position of authority or counsel so you know my brother and sister there's times that we would come forward and you know take this and if we're not careful we'll take the things of the bible the things of the word of god and we will approach them as though they are suggestions now a suggestion is an idea or plan put forward for consideration now there is a radical difference of taking something as a directive which is an official on authoritative instruction and reducing it down to a position where it is put up for consideration amen so you know there is a time to consider look it up in your bible the word consider shows up many many times one that comes first to my mind is consider the lily amen so it's telling you to go out and look at that and consider what is happening there look at it analyze it study it amen so the word or the approach of considering is not anti-word but my brother and sister it is also not got the authority to move you forward because considering does not bring necessarily a mode of action are you with me amen so you look now there's nowhere in the word of god nowhere in the word the directive is that all things are possible if you consider it says all things are possible so what is our directive belief there's the directive it's not that all things are possible if you believe in god you would believe all things were possible but the directive is to believe not consider amen so as you look at this you realize that what satan has come he's come down in the day that we live in he's moved in he's come in such a way that we have come to consider many people around the message they would say well okay i i believe this i do this and and you look at it and this sounds harsh in judgment but forgive me and they are not really believing they're not acting upon it they're considering it and when you just consider something it does have an impact upon your thinking but my brother and sister when we pray we don't pray that god would consider us we pray that god would hear us it is not just lord if you have nothing better to do would you ponder my situation but we pray for a direct action can you say amen we're not praying a vague prayer of lord if you feel like or if this could be but when we pray we pray lord heal this person heal this save my son my wife my daughter whatever it might be we are praying for a direct action and if we are praying for something that would fall under just a consideration then it's because we do not have faith in the one that we are praying to but if you have prayer if you have faith in the one you're praying to your prayer you believe as a son or daughter of god will be answered someone say amen to that i believe god answers my prayer in fact i don't just believe it i have tangible evidence that god answers my prayers amen now does that sound boastful well i hope we have something to boast on hallelujah come on saints we got to have something to boast on that's right i think you're missing it i'm a boaster hallelujah i like to boast amen i don't have much to boast on in me as a man in fact i have a lot of things i just don't even like to admit in public you know i buy something that falls apart you know it's hard to admit you paid money for something that don't last amen but you see i have something to boast on and that was the fact that god after i went out and jumped off the high board into an empty swimming pool as it were that god come along and says now before you hit the concrete to the bottom of this i will come amen amen now do we tempt god no but you know what some of us were just silly enough we jumped off the high board with nothing to back it up and god still come on the scene amen and he saved us he healed us he delivered us amen i got something to boast on hallelujah amen nothing of man but all of our lord jesus christ now as we look at this now we're looking right here now at a time that's talking about paul or saul and how that he had come down and all that happened there when the light the pillar of fire come to him and uh so that is the background of this and there was one a prophet down in the city who saw in a vision while he was praying and he came now i want to tell you this was paul jumping off the high board saints he thought he was doing the right thing he thought he was serving god thought he was fulfilling the word of god and he had even slain the saints and he comes to a place but you see now the bottom being if you follow my analogy the bottom being that before he had went too far which would be the bottom of the swimming pool god come down and caught him and so it's there ananias came and come into saul laid his hands upon him and he was healed by divine healing he rose then and was baptized washed away washing away his sins calling on the name of the lord and then he had an absolute he was never the same after that he went straight from church to church from place to place trying to build up that which he had tried to tear down now when you look at the effect of paul's life those he persecuted what was greater his persecution or the building up it's not even a question is it for here we are in the year 2020 still being blessed by the gospel that god laid on john i mean paul's heart preached amen see not looking at the negative my brother and sister but if we're not careful we can look at one little segment of our life and we will be controlled for years by that segment of our life and satan will always point back amen to that point but he won't point to the building up because if he points to the building up he has to acknowledge that god is doing something in your life and so he takes you in a snapshot of time back to a place a time that you were backslid maybe never even ever saved so he wasn't backslid but you were there in that condition and what you might have done what you might have experienced what you might have done to others and he wants to constantly bring that back before you in fact there's years of evidence that god has done something god has changed god has turned the direction and yet he will keep us focused on one little point oh my god ah how clever satan is right amen so what does he do he goes back to church to church from place to place trying to build up that's what he had tried to tear down how the nation how the christian world this morning needs that type of an absolute those who had creeds of traditions has tried to with doctrine of men to disqualify god's word to being the same yesterday and forever they need an absolute an experience of meeting on a damascus road the living god who can heal the sick raise the dead and cast out devils a genuine absolute now look at this we got to come to the place saints that we have this for ourself that we know he says paul knew something had happened can someone lift a hand and say i know something happened amen i'm not living on mama's experience or daddy's experience or our church experience well what are you i'm a methodist because i was born a methodist well i'll tell you if it was for the grace of god what would i be i got my catholic background we got mormon background we've got methodist background which one of those would i have been it wouldn't have mattered my brother and sister because i wasn't called to be one of them amen i was called to come out of it can someone say amen to that i was called to not be identified by a name over the door but by the god that resides in the house amen hallelujah a genuine absolute paul knew that something had happened there was no one could take it away from him nothing else mattered he was tied and that was it no matter what come he knowed he was tied christ centered life now if i speak a little strongly on these things i don't want you to think i'm judging them because i in my heart i'm not but my brother and sister i got friends i was just joking with one of them the other day he was talking about a deal and it scared him and i said yeah i probably scared you bad enough to about jerk your rosary beat off the mirror and he laughed and says really close now my brother and sister in a time of great travail what is that rosary bead going to do for you amen nothing but you see it becomes instinctive i want to ask you what's instinctive when crisis comes to you what do you reach for when crisis comes to your life do you reach to see what your bank account says do you reach well we won't waste the time going through all of those things i doubt if any of us have too big of a stockpile of gold but it won't do any good anyway reminds me of a friend of mine and and i believe he's right on a great portion of this he said when chaos comes to the earth he said your money will be just paper with ink on it won't have any value and he says that's why i have gold and i have silver now some of you know me sometimes i probably speak when i shouldn't but i told this friend of mine i says it's no problem i don't need to save any gold he says yes you do paul you've got to have something to be able to buy food and do whatever i said no friend i just follow you home and kill you take your gold he looked at me like what and i said you know i wouldn't do that and he goes wow you had to be scared for a moment but someone would but someone would now i lay this in place so these next few words that we are looking at might register to you in a deeper fashion amen to everything there is a season a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and beautiful i look out my little grandson declan i look at little brother samuel amen i look at a little baby take that is coming little alley time to be born it's beautiful isn't it you to hold them little babies many of you wouldn't know them but would be almost like a second son to sister jerry and i uh jesse barrios him and his wife passed through town uh my children grew up with them i think i met jesse he was probably just a knee-high to a grasshopper and uh now he's head high to a big man and you look at that my brother and sister all the seasons and all the times and all of this coming and and you look at what's happening around us and you recognize a time to be born and a time to die i want to ask you a question was he talking naturally or spiritually or both a time to be born in jesus christ a time to die to ourself amen a season amen hallelujah a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down do you realize if there's barriers in our life god is not going to come and let you build an oasis at that barrier in your life you weren't called to stop this side of glory and build an oasis on earth we were called to tear down everything that hinders our spiritual walk now god's not going to do it now some people think the preacher is is going to come in and fix that for you and some resent the fact they feel like the preacher is coming to do that for you but did you know that you have to be the one that tears it down it's only as it were your hands and the anointing of almighty god that will tear down the strongholds of your life if you choose to hold that's the reason i use the reference of hands if you choose to hold on to that stronghold god's not going to come and tear it down but it's at the point in time that you become sick and tired of being sick and tired and you come to the place that you say satan you're not gonna bind me any longer and i am pushing back against this i demand a deliverance oh saints i i don't know maybe i'll be a little too blunt this morning but i want to ask you those issues that you have in your life have you come to the place that you stand before god in the right spirit and the right attitude and demand a deliverance from that hindrance if you haven't then you're holding on to that hindrance we've often used a little story of analogy i think it come out of russian history is that where i found it of a story of a little boy who found a baby wolf in the woods and he brought it home when the parents said that's a wolf you can't keep it the little boy cried and cried and the family gave in and the little wolf was growing and growing and him and the boy played and played and had lots of fun running through the woods and the wolf was growing and growing and one day the parents come home and there's no little boy but a sleepy wolf my brother and sister a wolf is a wolf no matter how cute it is when it's little a spirit is a spirit no matter how it doesn't seem to impact your life when it is little but the day will come it will consume you amen and so we need to deal with the wolf when we meet the wolf not when the wolf has consumed us amen hallelujah so as we look at this everything a season a time to kill a time to heal time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn in time to dance a time to cast away stones in a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate now the scripture says anyone who hates his brother and says he loves the lord is a liar so what are we going to hate hallelujah we'll address that here in just a moment a time of war and a time of peace we look at this and of course in our subject today as we're thinking it's a time to break down in a time to build up and god provides a season my brother and sister now i i'm going to be presumptuous forgive me but you know every one of us has things that we need to deal with in our life sometimes they're things that we have just pushed them to the side we become passive about them but if that is there and it is still something that has any kind of controlling influence in your life now that controlling influence might be that you have been brought to a place i'll just share a little story now as a little boy i like to talk a lot and as a big boy i like to talk a lot but when i was a little boy i was with my older brother and we went to a little country store that was close to my grandmother's farm and uh the man my my brother was like 14 years old and the man was selling my brother cigarettes and i stood there in the store as a little boy and i looked at the man and i said you shouldn't be selling my brother cigarettes you're evil and the man told me shut up you mouthy little boy and get out of here and i made a statement i'm telling my grandmother and he said you ever come in this store again i'll slap your head off and i was like a little intimidated but you know when i got back to the house and i'm looking at my grandmother and here's my brother acting all weird you know because he's hit the cigarettes under a rock out behind the metal bar and he's all acting weird and it just come out of me i couldn't help it maybe god knew i'd be a preacher i just couldn't help it i had to you know what grandma my brother just bought cigarettes from that old fat bald man down there at this store oh my brother got so angry he was like i'm gonna beat you and i was like well it's the truth didn't it didn't he sell you cigarettes didn't he sell you cigarettes didn't he huh did he not sell you cigarettes answer me my grandmother said did he sell you cigarettes and my brother got all embarrassed i sold i bought cigarettes didn't stop him my grandma said you go get him wherever you hit him and bring him here she reduced them to ashes but you know the next time i walked into that store that man was right there and this we're talking not just a day or two this is down the road he saw me and he goes i won't i cannot repeat all the words because they were they were lightning laced but he said oh there's that little boy that's got diarrhea of the mouth pretty funny isn't it except for as a little boy that was like to own the strongest insults that had ever been hurled at me in my mouth in my life i was like diarrhea of my mouth and you know what it took years for me to wake up one day and say wait here's a man who corrupted every young person young man young woman sold beer and all that to underage kids cigarettes to chewing tobacco all of this just a corrupt man and it took years for me to wake up one day i was probably 17 or 18 so you know half a dozen years i was like why do i let the words of a perverted man have an impact on me now do i suffer from the symptoms of diarrhea of the mouth well hallelujah sometimes i just can't shut up say last sunday for example but you see my brother and sister what i speak is not of the darkness but we speak of the light and how can we put a limit to the light follow the light i remember reading a story once where a man wanted to fly around the world and he just wanted to follow the light it was like a little experiment that he had and they did a great effort but it was not actually possible because it come to a time and a place he had to stop and naturally refill the airplane and different things like that and so then they was not able to stay up with the light but we have been called of almighty god to walk in the light so therefore god provided the ability for us to walk in the light we don't have to stop the light's not going to leave us behind we can walk constantly day by day in the light amen what a beautiful analogy what a beautiful type that it is amen so we look at this now let me move forward here uh in jude the first chapter amen but it says here not but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last day who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves central having not the spirit but remember now we've studied through the years the effect of but and this applies right here he's talking about something that would make us nervous we would look around saying okay where's his spirit who's this is this and this and this what is it but he says but ye beloved so he's identifying a certain class of people building up yourselves on your most holy faith now i want to just look at this for a few minutes my brother and sister we realized that all things we do uh because of and through him right through jesus christ and so we know that we cannot hold ourselves we cannot save ourselves we cannot give deliverance to ourselves but yet as the promise of god is being manifested or magnified in the day that we live in right it says that as a gross darkness comes on the land that the light would actually be identified to a greater degree and as i've shared with you before flying over south america in the middle of the night a lot of jungle a lot of not much out there and uh just sitting there uh looking out the window of an airplane praying about the meetings and the things that we were going to do for the lord and looking down there in this vast uh the darkness that you see and all of a sudden you see a single pinpoint of light my brother and sister that light shines out of the darkness so incredible amen you don't have to have lots of lights you just need one light amen and you can find it in the darkness amen so we are not worried about what is happening in this world of gross darkness because the light has come and we are attracted to the light amen so if we take these promises of god all that is opened and while we know that we cannot do this in ourselves right can't save ourselves can't heal ourselves can't deliver ourselves but the promise of god has been delivered to you and i can you say amen to that we have the promise we don't have to go ask for the promise we don't have to search for the promise the promise is right here in the word now if we have the promise my brother and sister then we have all of the potential that god intended for the bride of christ in the latter days and we don't have to go out here and try and find a new startling revelation what we have to do is take the word for our day and apply that word to our life believe that word and act upon that word and let it act upon us and as this happens we have now every tool that we need so but ye beloved building up yourself now we could take that and say well how can i build myself up well my brother and sister it is in your most holy faith amen it is in the word right because faith cometh by the hearing of the word and so you take this word and start to apply it and as it is applied to your life you have a choice amen now i don't know about you guys but i take vitamins when i remember too hallelujah you know what it tells you it tells you that all is not totally sold out to the idea of taking vitamins or i'd be able to tell you i take my vitamins three times a day like clockwork i take my vitamins when i get up in the morning and i remember on my way out the door i really should take some vitamins i'm getting old i need to take some kind of anti-aging vitamin and i do amen it's called reading the word of god amen i'll never get old reading it and so as we approach this my brother and sister i want you to catch this now you have to take this a tad bit carnal hope you don't mind you're gonna have to just build yourself up if you're waiting for me to come to your house and build you up you might be waiting a while if you're going to be built up when you come to church you're not going to get built up but a couple times a week remember the old phrase two steps forward three steps back well if you take that and the only time you're ever built up is when you come to church it's going to be two steps forward and five steps back you have to decide how do i want to be built up now when i was a young man i know it doesn't doesn't look it so i'm not trying to live in the past but i used to go to fitness center men's only fitness center used to go there play racquetball lift weights swim run but i haven't done that for years and it shows i used to be able to run six minute miles mile after mile used to be able to ride a dirt bike in the desert for hours wide open not stop and rest but it's not working very good living on those laurels now i run halfway to the mailbox walk the rest of the way you know how close my mailbox is no you see you can't live in the past that's right if you want to be built up in the holy ghost it is just like these fitness fanatics they get up every single day and they build themselves up son or daughter of god the only way we're going to be spiritually fit is building ourself up you say well if i'm the bride of christ if i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god god's going to do this and god's going to do that my brother and sister that's not how it works god gives you everything that you need to make the rapture he's waiting on you to apply it hallelujah because you know now i say this in humor i don't want anybody to be offended but did you know if you left it to the preachers to build you up you wouldn't like it that's right i can assure you you wouldn't like it because a preacher had come in and he'd take your piles of magazines and your piles of books and your piles of this and your piles of that and he'd get a dumpster out there and he'd go through your house and he would decide arbitrarily you can live without it you can live without it you can live without it you can live without it there wouldn't hardly be nothing but one pair of shoes maybe two we'll give you a pair of dress shoes for church two pairs of shoes my goodness sister jerry would supply the goodwill for months she wouldn't like it oh you sisters giggle you wouldn't like it either because it'd be a lot easier to be hard on you than it would be hard on my wife so hallelujah but you see that's not how building it up comes it's not someone forcing you to build this up it's you with a great burden you deciding i'm fed up with my spiritual condition i'm fed up with the condition of my marriage i'm fed up with the condition of my children i'm fed up with the condition of my church and i'm going to start building this thing up tear it right down to the foundation lord how many have the courage to say tear our church right down to the foundation and rebuild it like it should be but you see we become comfortable in our church the way it is well there's a few things i don't like about it but there's a lot of things that i'm comfortable with so let's just leave it alone how about we become fed up and say lord now's a time now's a good season where the word of god shows us that this is the end time we're seeing the spirits coming bubbling to the surface we're seeing demonic spirits bubbling to the surface maybe we ought to be building ourselves up maybe status quo is not going to get us in a rapture that's right come on don't don't frown at me saints not every day can be popsicles and ice cream time that we must be built up you don't have to lift a hand for me because it's irrelevant for me but it comes to a time that you got to decide and you will decide it may not be lifting a hand or saying yes or no but there'll be a day that you make the decision i will be built up in the things of god or i will be built up in the things of the world amen but he says here but beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost oh what do we got to do we've got to not just say a prayer i'm guilty just like you are sometimes it's like lord you know super tired lord just thank you for being with us today keeping us safe lord you know let us rise in the morning give praise to you as we labor and hallelujah now i probably missed the mark there's no one like that maybe it's just me what does the word say that's right how are we going to get billed well brother i read my bible and i pray every day oh but beloved remember you the words which were spoken before of the apostles i wonder what words he's talking about there of our lord jesus christ man i'm just too tired i can't even read should we hold an election next week come on my brother and sister verse 19 says that these people separate themselves sensual they don't even have the spirit doesn't mean they're not religious doesn't mean they don't go to church doesn't mean they don't read their bible doesn't mean they don't pray they just don't have the spirit but ye beloved hallelujah talk to a whole different class of people but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost there's where prayers make a difference there's where prayers shake the very foundation as it were just a phrase of heaven amen because your prayer has power behind it amen keeping yourselves in the love of god looking for mercy of our lord jesus christ and into eternal life what does it do it entirely changes your engagement oh my brother and sister you know i had a friend that sold cars years ago he's quite well did quite well out of it used to right over here at ed marks this will make you all feel bad that buy new cars he used to make about two hundred thousand dollars a year on commission selling cars right here in the town of nampa idaho lived a a awesome life then the dealership started to change hands and they said we're not gonna pay commission no more we're gonna just pay you a wage and he says my wages went down to less than half now my brother and sister scott had a different kind of enthusiasm he goes out on a car lot he looks at you you know what he's what scott saw you i used to joke with scott about this i'd say scott you don't see paul scott you see dollar bills and he was like you're absolutely right and i look at people and i'm like i don't care what they're wearing i don't care what they're driving right now that guy has money and he sensed that and he just ignore people like me and go sell the car to some guy in grubby jeans and whatever driving a beat up pickup because that man has money and he was right more often than not now saw scott got in the spirit of selling cars scott didn't go out there and somebody says well now sir i know this isn't your brand of car this is a nissan and scott would say yes it's got a two-point blah blah motor turbocharged he's got this it's got this differential it's got this this this would do because in his time waiting for the prey i mean for the customer scott would whip his phone out just like you do and he would go specifications nissan pathfinder oh you want a pathfinder it's got this it's got this it's got this and people are like wow you're the only guy around here knows anything about it why he had passion scott didn't like you scott liked your money scott liked your money at his cabin in the mountains scott liked your money in his uh ski boat scott liked your money in his jet boat scott liked your money in his house in arizona scott had passion i told scott once you had made a great christian he said well i'm lds and i said i stand on what i said and he's like now back to you but i shouldn't laugh because he sold me a vehicle because he knew what he was talking about what did he do i hope you catch this scott didn't sit back and say well if they want to buy it they'll buy it i don't have to know anything about it scott builded himself up in what he did he knew what he was talking about he knew what he believed in and that was the belief that he could sell anyone a car but you beloved building yourselves up on your most holy faith what are we commanded to do to take our faith to another level not just common everyday faith not just well i believe this i'm a message believer took his faith to another level to a most holy faith what was he doing believing enough that you could pray in the holy ghost and that would change your life amen not just praying praying will change your life but praying in the holy ghost will be a whole life-changing event not just reading your bible i wasn't going to mention who shared this with me but i was talking brother george out of the blue he calls me the other day and uh he's so funny he's such a character he's looks like hey stranger and i said hey brother george how are you he doesn't even answer my question he goes how's that pie making wife of yours i was like what am i chopped liver he's like oh i was going to get back to you he's funny character but we got talking about serious things and he made a a comment he said you know paul he said no i wish people could catch the revelation of praying through amen and then reading their bible then the bible become a whole new book when you've entered in and got in the presence of almighty god and then you read his word the bible becomes an all-new book oh now let's digress to a little video here i picked my bible up i read it this week brother paul i read it again and i read it again but remember what he said the research showed nothing really changed until they got to reading it four times a week i don't want to call people out but on the whatsapp those of you that read it would see it sister amy made a comment wow what would happen if we read it seven times a week if four times a week changes all those statistics about our life our loneliness this that and the other if four times a week would change that what would seven or nine or ten or twelve or 15 what would that change saints come on none of your none of you look excited or happy this morning what's wrong come on i came here happy today amen i've made you all sad you're all sitting here looking at me like [Music] oh i know what it is the devil's telling you see you didn't read your bible this last week okay flash game everybody that read it once hold up a finger with one no some of you don't think that's funny some of you look at me like kind of little spitefully look come on i'm going to stir up your pure minds that's what i believe it is i'm going to stir up your pure minds you're not going to make it you're not going to make it to the stand before the lord and say well paul never told us paul never said a word i'm going to tell you the word whether you like me or not i'm going to tell you the word you can always trade me in on a younger model brother chris is available you want an older higher mileage model brother david's available now brother david's not smiling but look saints it doesn't matter what you really want it to be are we lining up with this or not is this having the impact on her life that god intended for it to have i can play patty cake with you and we can all walk out feeling so good but i don't want to be found lacks in my job you want to change in your life if you're not happy in your world right now if you're not happy with marriage you're not happy with children you're not happy with your job you're not happy with yourself there is a remedy amen you don't have to go forward in that position and say well i prayed god didn't answer the prayer well maybe god answered it you just didn't like the answer and subconsciously put it to the side okay well praise the lord maybe this will be a short enough sermon amen look all the tools are available amen all the tools are available pray before you read your bible get in the spirit amen this book i guarantee you will become a new book right we want it to be a book of life to us it'll be a new book to us right now let's look at this here amen at the end of jude here keep yourselves in the love of god looking for mercy of lord jesus christ and eternal life amen and of some have compassion making a difference now i told you a few minutes ago we'd come out and touch this see others save with fear amen we don't like to be preached to in such a fashion that we're afraid to go to hell but others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh see we can't become comfortable saints that we're message believers that god sent a prophet that all of this is done and we're fine no my brother and sister we need to come to the place we don't even want our garment to be spotted by the flesh and somebody needs to stand as it were a faithful brother faithful friend faithful sister faithful friend and be able to say their spots on your garment without us becoming offended we need to come to the place that we actually can say lord i realize i'm not living you know our problem is as we say we're holding the church but holiness does not mean long hair and a long dress holiness is the state of the soul amen it's not a state of the wardrobe it's a state of the soul amen and if we're not careful we fall into a pattern where holiness becomes a state of our wardrobe and it is not a state or the condition of our soul and we find that our garment is all spotted but we are not concerned with that because we can pass our own analysis hallelujah praise the lord well this service is going a little different than i thought because i feel mean and grumpy because i don't like the devil that's what it's coming down to remember we talked earlier about hate that's right well it's right here amen that's it pulling them out hating even the garment spotted by the flesh that ought to be the only hate that is in a son or daughter of god on a behating that garment that is spotted by the flesh not those around us not the world we live in not all of that they can't help what they believe they can't change what they believe it takes god god's the only one that can call them amen hallelujah well i want to just move forward here modern events see a man can say anything but lest god interprets that word see now we have our own interpretation we say it means this and this one methodist says this baptist says this the pentecostal said this the oneness says this the tunis says this and oh my there you are but god don't need no interpreter he's his own interpreter he interprets his own word by vindicating it in the age that it's purposed for the age that it's given for we're not living in a pentecostal age i once had a sister uh you know uh she she was disagreeing with me and she's like so you're saying that we have something better than what happened on the day of pentecost and i said no sister not something better but we do have something different and it's something different in the sense that receiving the baptism of the holy ghost true baptism of holy ghost doesn't give one person more authority than the next unless god's called them endowed them with a gift or a calling but you look at this and realize that it is what its purpose for so we cannot go back and try to recreate the upper room experience and say what we're going to do now is this is going to have us an upper room experience in the church and we can satisfy that scripture we're living in a different time right we're not living in a pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in the methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bright age amen the calling out of the church and getting it together for rapture that's the age we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth see so we're not trying to go back and recreate that we have there now under the auspice of the first fruits my brother and sister there has to be one come to maturity and it is that this is where the great crux of our day is the great disagreement my brother and sister that people are pointing back uh laying uh the credit as it were to the prophet when in the reality the first fruit was our lord jesus christ and that now fell down as a anointing upon the prophet to the age he comes to maturity and so it's a chain of events it's not a singular event but it is a chain of events that come to pass and then here we are as believers and that first fruit anointing must come on you and i we cannot stop and say well it is the ministry it is the pastor we're doing good they understand the word it's a maturity that must come down to you and i and as that the representation that is brought forth of our lord jesus christ coming down into prophetic word coming right down into a bride what did the prophet of god say he said that you and i would be the final voice to the final age and so that means that it will not be an immature voice that is coming with a speculation of what god meant or some hope of what god meant but a maturity coming down that the bride of christ comes to the place she speaks with authority why because she's now become a mature bride amen she is not now having to say well i don't know we i i have to ask someone i'd have to do no this bride knows what she's talking about because she's had an experience and god has dealt directly now remember we were looking at the scripture how and the quotes look at that how did paul know because it was a first-hand experience no one come peter didn't come to paul and say now paul the day will come and this and this and this and this no paul had a first-hand experience he was struck from the horse he was blind god sent a anointing to a prophet the prophet comes up says i was sent of god i was praying i was sent of god to pray for you that you might receive your sight and god confirming then what had been spoken is praise for him he has his sight he has a conversion he's no longer a theological believer he is now a true believer hallelujah this age that we're living in my brother and sister no theological believer will take a rapture we're living on up here to the bride age the calling out of the church that's taking place it's happening getting it together for the rapture amen people have this idea i've had this spoken to me well when will the unity come in the message my brother and sister i'm here to disappoint you there'll never be a unity in this message there will be a unity in the bride of christ because i don't know unless somebody's changed listen let's let's take a little vote on what change we want to be i can i could load us all up in a bus to train a plane and we could go right here within these 48 states and i can walk you right in the door of a polygamous church that believes this message just as much as you do they say now if we fellowship together sooner or later something's got to change are we going to become them are they going to become us you can't fellowship together unless you agree that's what the word of god says now i use that because it's a safe somewhat said polygamy a safe topic no it's a seducing spirit now i say this in humor that some of you looking grumpy at me could maybe have a little humor today my wife's gave me permission to have as many wives as i want only she worded this way you can have just as many wives as you can support i'll take a half a one i'm sorry sister jerry but can we join together with that and call it one happy church there's no way saints there's no way you can't have fellowship lest you agree amen so getting ready for rapture it means two different things to two different people but the bride will have unity amen this bride is going to have unity now i'm getting close to quitting here we're down i can see the plate amen amen we're living up in the bride age that's the age we're now living to my honest opinion is exactly the truth and this book is a book of prophecy that's right its believers are suggested to honor it and read it and believe its author i want to tie you right to our earlier thought is it a suggestion no the prophet of god said it's commanded strong words to believers are commanded to honor it and to read it and believe its author for every word that's written in there must come to pass you see the problem we've got is where we've come to where we've taken the the command and we've turned it into a suggestion it won't work it won't work we have to take the commands as a command amen everything that's been promised has to has has to come to pass because it is jesus christ in each age the same yesterday it was jesus christ was in noah it was jesus christ moses it was jesus christ and david it was jesus christ and joseph it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it's jesus christ among his people today now i want to know who this applies to jesus christ in his people today uh who who does that apply hallelujah it applies to you and i amen we have to claim that we can't just say okay okay the prophet said it i believe it no you have to actually lay claim on that you have to reach out and say you know what this word was sent you know i have a just a really distorted i have a very distorted view on malachi 4. can i get you all nervous come on i want to say it again i got a really distorted view on malachi 4. god sent a prophet to this loudest in age just for me well that's when i read if they would put up malachi 4 5 we could read that to you behold i send you and i'm the one reading it so he sent a prophet to me amen i hope you can see the same distorted view that i see because my brother and sister this is not something you just cast to the whole world he wrote it in the word behold i send elijah the prophet to you and i'm right over here saying i claim this i claim this if god sent a prophet he sent it for me he knew i had the seat can someone say amen to that he knew i had the seed and so he knew something had to come and dig all the overburden and all of the big cloths and the rocks and the sticks and the trash and expose that seed to the light and to the moisture and to bring the life into that seed that that seed could respond hallelujah and so therefore he says i know you have the seed in you i'm going to send the prophet to you oh hallelujah you got i believe you know reason i use the words distorted is because i believe that you have to see it that way you can't see that it's just well god sent a prophet no big deal no sir he sent it to me he said to me he had my address he knew right where to find me he knew right what condition i would be in when it came to me and he knew what response it would be in my heart and he knew how long it would take for the seed to germinate it's almost we baptized some of these young children here in the church just kids and you think well do they have a real understanding of the lord and then you you get to see and then you get to see them growing and you're going to see and you get to hear them and you've got all this and then you start to realize you know what god's dealt with that child amen and then some of us had to get well well along all along the path before it finally pushed out of the ground but the seed was there and when the season comes it comes to life now my brother and sister you want to pile rocks on your seed go right ahead you can do that but i like to see i like to see you know i've been known i'm sorry just a little personal i've been known to be out there on a tractor in a field and see beans corn whatever coming up and see a rock in the field you know how easy it is just to say well it's only one little plant it doesn't make a difference what do you do put the tractor in park climb out of that nice air conditioner into the dust get my clean wranglers dirty dirt on my shoes i got no place to put the rock so i have to take the rock and put it in the cab with me and my nice new shiny tractor see there's a lot of reasons why not to do this but it only takes one reason why and that is that seed is not going to live underneath that rock so you get out and you take that rock and you pick it up and you put it in your nice shiny little tractor and you haul it to the end of the field and you throw it on top of a pile where all the rocks go and i could never find that spot again but when i'm harvesting that field i know that somewhere about right here is a plant that lives because i cared enough amen to get rid of the rock saints care enough amen parents care enough in your own life to take the rock out of your family so your children will live ministry care enough to lift the people up and preach what god lays on your heart that they can live because you see if we look at it and pardon me sister nadia but if i don't care that the rock is there if i don't care can i look sister naughty in the face and say i love you sister no you can't do that we got to carry enough saints i love my children but i don't love them enough to throw the garbage out of my house i don't pray i don't love my nafta i have an altar in my home but i love them i want to see them saved could someone come and influence my children that they'd get saved why don't you influence your children why don't you put the altar why don't you light the altar why don't you keep the fire burning on the altar amen why don't you learn amen to pray amen in the holy ghost or do we care enough i think we better call them musicians you guys are looking down right hostile three kinds of believers what a sermon to close it off on david said you meet me with a sword actually this is a positive thing i love this you meet me with a sword and a spear with armor you meet me in the name of a philistine but i meet you without a sword or a speared an armor but i meet you in the name of the lord god of israel there you are that's a believer that's his fortress that's his shield that's his defense amen that should be the church defense any believer that's his defense no matter what takes place what the world says anything else your defense is the lord god of israel that's it the name of jesus christ is a strong mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe that's our defense is jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah you know what saints some of you probably think i'm a little grumpy this morning but actually i've got joy bouncing around like a little deer in my heart because you see we're in the thrashing season nothing better than the thrashing season you know why you get to see everything that you've labored for coming to pass coming to fruition saints i'm going to tell you election time's coming our nation will have an election [Music] but you and i will elect [Music] you and i will elect how can i say it kindly how can i say it nicely it's time to quit playing the game it's time to get so serious that we are going to say i'm not going to settle for this any longer that's where we've got to come it's election time you will elect what you're going to do will i build the altar as it were in my home will i build it in my heart will i i make the commitment will i throw my lazy ways out will i throw my distracted ways out look it applies to every one of us no one's no one's exempt from this but it comes to a season we gotta elect what we're going to do so i speak a little solemnly today i speak a little straight to you today what will your election be do you have an excuse i've been called up for jury duty the minute i read the summons for jury duty i started formulating my excuse of why i couldn't serve [Music] i've got some doozies too don't formulate an excuse respond to the call give your all serve do get tired of what you've got in your life that's hindering you i want to ask you and one last one last left hook to you today saints then we'll sing what's hindering you i want you to stop and i want you to look at your life if you would look all the way from the beginning the end the sideways of your life what is hindering me and if you can find what's hindering you then deal with it be strong be courageous in the lord and deal with it don't leave some little thing out there you say well brother paul you don't understand well i'll tell what my brother and sister i do understand i've dealt with it amen i had to deal with it every day just like you have to deal with it every day and every day i have just come to a place lord i'm not going to settle for this any longer and i'm dealing with those things and it's making a change in my life amen because there's strongholds that hindered me the things that just held me back a little bit for years i've wanted to just just come out and speak the truth unvarnished and just encourage a church to break free to do that and i always had the excuses well you know i just can't i can't do that i i just saints we're putting that behind us we're putting that behind us find whatever it is that's hindering you tear it down tear it down let god pull it out of your life have a little memorial service i'll attend if you want amen bury that thing speak some words over it

can you guys smile at me so i know that some of you still still are okay most of you some of you are not okay well i don't mean trying to be funny but you see sometimes saints what is that old phrase you catch more with honey amen so i'm trying to use a little honey here i love you i want to see you prosper i want to see you overcoming i want to see you victorious and i also want to see you free from whatever is hindering you amen so i can preach good to you i can preach nice to you i can butter you up hallelujah my brother and i was talking about this once brother david we literally you know he said oh there they have a farmer's market there and these people have these like 40 pound blocks of butter and he said wouldn't that be funny brother paul that we just part way through the service have on the brothers just push this big block of butter up here and tell them now saints come on go on start come up form a line we're going to just butter you all up he said i think it'd be so funny to do that they wouldn't though because their sunday best they'd have butter all over it we're not here to butter you up we're here to preach the truth to you scripture says to stir up pure minds in remembrance that's what we're here for saints your pure mind to be stirred and say you know what lord i've been letting down the bar i haven't been praying like i should i've got some issues i've been feeling lonely i've been feeling lonely why like you said right there how many times have you been in this scripture i got some other issues in my life have you been in the scripture you feel discouraged how much have you been in your bible you feel like god's not there for you how much are you reading your bible come on saints i've got the big stirs account i want to stir you up today

happy we're gonna have such a glorious service today and hear y'all just yelling at me now either i failed or you did or something i don't know what but look i think that i think the word of god is good i think god knows what he's doing i think that we need to sometimes stop and say okay have i just become settled in as a message believer and there's nothing really stirring in my life oh maybe i could go this far how many of you you don't have to lift your hands how many of you this last week have asked god to do the supernatural in your life i'm not talking about you prayed for something i'm talking about literally lifting a voice and saying lord i want to see the supernatural [Music] if you can't lift your hand in your heart right now then i'm going to encourage you to start doing that because that's going to make the difference that's god present on the spot with you the supernatural prophet of god said wherever god is as supernatural is present so maybe you said lord i want you to come in my house and my car my office this week you're asking for the supernatural hallelujah oh hallelujah thee [Applause] [Music] thee are alone are my strength my shield to you alone as my spirit
