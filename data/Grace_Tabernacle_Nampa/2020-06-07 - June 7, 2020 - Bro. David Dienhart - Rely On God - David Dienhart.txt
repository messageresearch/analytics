me hallelujah I'm so thankful god bless you brother I bless you sister appreciate the song service I had that in my heart to sing that today and I just felt checked and I know why now because this to be sung now I'm gonna sing at the end of the service but God knows all things stand with me together I want to bring something to your heart or to your thoughts into your attention I should say I guess I'll get the word out right here I'm gonna be a little different in ministering this morning more than different than what you're normally used to seeing me minister God laid a very definite way to bring this this morning I want your hundred divided I say God wants your undivided attention I'm going to do a lot of reading and I don't mean to do that it's not like me to do that I don't like to do that but please don't take an offense to what I just said because this is important this is something I'm not just reading to be reading God laid this in my heart this is something pertaining to the very day an hour and things that are happening now and unfolding to happen if you miss something I know there's children with parent I mean parents with children little ones if you miss it go back and get the archives if you have a pen something to write on write down what I'm referring to go back and read it I'm only going to bring out what the Lord wants me to bring out there sings I'll probably skip because of time but I want you to listen can you give God that much grace please I it's Sunday morning I don't wouldn't do that at night but God laid this very definitely I struggled very heavily Satan trying to stop me me away from this but I know God's right on time I believe it's something we need is something the future I believe it's going to help all of us not because I'm saying it because I just feel very anointed of God to break this this way so listen carefully I pray that God will bless His Word open the word to our hearts let's pray our Heavenly Father you know I'm standing here in the midst of your presence I'm standing here in the midst of your body I'm standing here in the midst of your church yourself your body your flesh and bone here's a part of it here Lord and and you're wanting their attention and I Lord I pray that you would I just give you my absolute undivided attention myself lord I know as a man I do not have a human ability to bring anything to these people that would help them but I'm not depending on this I pray that they'll not depend on themselves it's a morning they're refreshed Lord and you've chosen to bring it this way I pray Heavenly Father believing your anointing me and the way you want me to anoint them to hear and receive the way you would have them to and Lord may you be praised and glorified in all things and that's not to say we don't stop amens and this Lord it's just gonna be different you wanted me to say it that way and Lord but you do things different you do things unexpected you do things in an unexpected time and way that your prophet said you met you there unchanging God doing things in an unexpected way your prophet taught us that and showed us that that your sovereignty new things the way you want to do it but you have a purpose in all of it Lord in doing what you want to do and father I'm standing up here needing miu more than I then probably most of these people right here this more time I don't mean that to be different but I'm just saying I need you Lord and these people need you and we all need you were in tremendous times we're in a very time of gross darkness but to the bride it's light and father I want to express the light as your prophet has expressed it because I don't know any other way to get out what you've laid my heart but to say what he said I'm not meaning saying what he said but to read what he said because he said it in the way that Lord I believe you wanted your people to receive it and so father I just commit this to you I commit these scriptures I commit through you unfold that you deal with every individual heart as you have predestined to do so and Lord you open their hearts to receive and if they go back and read these things and meditate upon them which I believe you'd have them to do then Lord then Lord I pray that you would open it you would reveal it further because Lord were in a tremendous time we're also in a very deceitful time but there's only one thing that can discern that time and that deceit is the token himself so Heavenly Father made there if there's anyone here that has not met you in their true baptism of the Holy Spirit may they meet you Lord that that TWIC ins that seed down and soul to make it live and manifest the word for the hour and time heavenly father may you grant these things now as I commit myself to you with this congregation under the power and leadership of your spirit may you so unlike these words Lord let it not be just something all my ho-hum I wish you would be quiet lord i bind every contrary devil from that Lord that your people would have freedom and they would receive what they're to receive for your glory Lord in thy name I pray not I don't have any right to stand here and give a reason why you do anything Lord I just believe it's ordained of you and I I believe you will you will manifest that soul now for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the congregation said amen amen I'd like you to turn with me to second Thessalonians why you're standing 2nd Thessalonians and I prayed that the word as it's read that the things that and there's a big comment I'm not saying like make a comment but I just believe the Lord has quickened this this way and that's between me and him anyway but I pray for you I asked for your undivided attention this morning second Thessalonians chapter 2 starting with verse 1 and I will hella bring that in a minute after we get to it second Thessalonians 2 verse 1 now we beseech you brethren watch this now by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him now Paul is referring tear to the first coming but it applies right over here to our time and our gathering together how many's gathering together with the word with you say one another yes one another in the word amen we're gathering together there's a unifying taking place what's doing it the revealing of Jesus Christ in his body amen alright now by our coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by our gathering together unto Him bead that you be not soon shaken in mind or troubled or be troubled neither by spirit this is very prevalent for the our notice is it very prevalent neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us I didn't say a letter from them but as from us as that day of Christ is at hand if you have a Scofield there's a B it at a little B you go down there now present let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come for that day for this very moment they were in right here where you'll understand as we go along except there come a falling away first and there had in order to come a falling away first there's got to be an absolute rejection of the word and the churches have rejected the nominal churches have absolutely rejected the word and put it on the outside and made way for Satan to come in and they've fallen away so except they that come to that falling way which has taken place something follows this alright for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that day or in that day brother sister we we I preached on that we've come back to we go back to revelations one we go back to several scriptures alright back to what the prophet said that day shall not come except their calling of become a falling away first and that man of sin aren't you glad for the message aren't you glad that we know who this is and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so close just like Judas he was the son of perdition same spirit don't think spirits don't want to stay out all they say all we can't we can't come around the message they absolutely have and we'll come into that in a little bit here that same time talking about spirits we're not warring against flesh and blood we're warning against spirits the word will uncover those spirits and only the word can uncover so the word has to be in you not only in letter but in you hallelujah so and and so that meant the son of perdition who opposeth who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember ye not when I was with you I told you these things remember you not when brother Branham was here he told us these things Paul speaking I preached what Paul preached he said see okay now and now you know what withholdeth now you know what withholdeth what's keeping him any worry ant worries that can't come right watch what he's saying every with a holdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he that's God who now letteth and that word means hinders will let or hinder until he be taken out of the way other words he can't do anything as long as the bride of Jesus he can't fully come to manifestation fully we know who he is we see him working but who letteth will let until he be taken he be taken his Christ the bride is taken out of the way all right now he said will be taken out of the way and then that wicked be revealed which the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him remember thy light has come brother sister them even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders now he's got signs he's got lying wonders lying wonders not truth lying wonders but watch that spirit can be manifest by the same anointing of the Holy Ghost that's in you to manifest the word I said a mouthful there didn't I not real quiet but that's the truth it takes the Holy Spirit to manifest both the weak and the seed both they live by the same life Satan can create all they can do is pervert what God has created amen any spirit that will not stay with that word and believe it and obey it has not the love of God and is not of God all there is - I don't care how close to the message they get Wow I all right all right now watch now listen to the score of the verse 10 he saw his inside the lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness of unrighteousness it them in them that perish that's not you bright because they received not the love of the truth they Seve not the love of the truth that they might be saved so it takes the love of the truth to be saved and when did he love you first before the foundation of the world identifying you to be seed because I love him now how do I know I love him I keep his word not me he does showing he's in me the love of God is present all right that they might all be now and and for this cause no way I'm backing up here the love of the truth they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them them not to bride them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they might all be damned who believed not the truth when did they not believe the truth from beginning before the foundation of the world they never could believe the truth believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now Matthew 24 and I'll let you be standing I got a couple two or three more just to lay a foundation here Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false anointed ones now the anointing is not false brother branham anointed ones the endtime made that very clear the anointing is the Holy Spirit for theirs but they are false on the inside of their soul they are not the seed of God they are not the elect of God they cannot hear the word of God receive it all right now for there shall arise false Christ's and false teachers prophets false preachers and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive they shall deceive the very elect now that's how close it'll be behold I have said I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go forth behold is in the secret chamber believe it not we know where he is we know where he is we know were provided place of worship we know where he put his name we know where he's at if you don't you need to hey man are you with me he lives in his word amen are you with me all right all right so he said here he's in the secret chambers believe it not for as the lightning they're gonna come with their own interpretation of these things there he's over here he's over here he's in Jeffersonville he's in the church he's over here he's in Brandon Tabernacle I'm not being sarcastic brother sister I'm defining a spirit all right I have nothing against any person anybody I can separate the person from an issue it's the spirit that makes you do and don't do what you do meet you or anybody else amen all right all right now so we so we go back here says now for as the lightning lightning the lightning of something lightning not lightning flash bang the Lightning cometh out of the east and shine it even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for wheresoever the carcass that's the provided word for the hour of the time the key of the fresh kill for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's not Hawks not buzzards not not vultures the Eagles will be gathered together immediately after the tribulation of those excuse me I want to stop right there that's going into that's going into the Jews for worse so ever the carcass is there will the eagle what brother Browns say what's the fresh what's the carcass the fresh manna he said you are not feeding upon the word of a man you are feeding upon the body word of the son of man amen you may be seated revelations chapter 13 I'm gonna keep moving here because I know I have to and I just you just pray for me I know you have how many is prayed for me god bless you you didn't have to raise your hand but I just just say men anyway I appreciate it cuz I'd only need it you need it we all need it I know I've got the answer for what I bring here this morning I'm fully aware of that all right chapter revelations chapter 13 we know what that is out of time there's so many things you could talk about revelations 13 I'm trying to hold myself back here because I know that this has got to be breached this way revelations 13 and don't think the devil don't fight revelations 13 verse 7 and it was given unto him that's the Beast to make war with the Saints and at the image remember there's an image made to the Beast it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and he did 68 million on the Martyrology of Rome alright are you with me okay same spirit we know that from the seals same spirit white horse red horse black horse same spirit in another ministry form all right same one all right now he said and all that dwell upon the earth excuse me make war with us and overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's tongues and nations and all that and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him we'd be in sad shape we didn't have the next statement whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world let let if any man have an ear well any normal man has an ear but that's not what he's talking about let a man have an ear let him hear let him hear all right first John 4:4 very familiar scriptures now first John 4:4 I'm trying not to to snuffle my nose so much I know that's on Mike I'm always gotten after because of that you know you just use your tanker chip use your all right I will when I think of it alright first John for for you are of God I made say men how many know that how many actually know that he said we would know it in that day you will know you are of God little children and have overcome them that's and brother Graham said that's that Antichrist spirit and have overcome them because greater is he person he either Sun veiled he that's been opened he that's made manifest and growing and and being cut out brother Graham said there was a stone cut out of the mountain it was a hidden stone light hadn't shown on that before was something hidden from the very foundation of the world all the way to our day but it was laying there in that word all the time in the body all the time and it broke forth and light he said stay here and you look in on this some did not very many most of them didn't are you with me while I go and get the interpretation of that come back and preach it to you in the opening of the seven seals I've got to go meet that cluster out there I've got to go meet that person that's the only one that can't open oh yeah and his sword was put in my hand and he said it fit my hand just perfectly all right now watch here we just go on you just keep praying for me you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you oh my goodness that is our keeping power that is where we're standing that's our stand actually we could call this here we stand part 2 but I haven't given you my title yet so we've got a subject here under that here we here we are of God little children overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in another person that is in the world all right Ephesians 6 last scripture while your your your reread here starting off Ephesians 6 and verse 10 through 13 we could read the whole thing I just wanted to save time here verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the token in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand brother Browne said the whole armor Supernatural put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles deceiving this deceivableness of Isles the traps looks for really like the same but it's a wily person the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places really high places in high places wherefore I think yea wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day or at and having done all to stand stand therefore god bless you amen now are you ready I'm going to be reading some up of this church age book and out of different things that prophet has said I'm reading out of the old one as you can see I don't have the new one I do have a new excuse me but I haven't read in it marked it up like had my old one it's kind of nice looking I don't want to mark it up in any way so if you want to refer I'm going to refer to page numbers that will not match the new one so you're gonna if you have a computer you think of something it's quoted like I quote here pick up the word put it together something stands out to you go look it up if you have another one you'll find it if you have the new I don't want to call it George Smith's version but it's just what he did I appreciate it it's good I like it okay is that you understand okay now before I do that I want to bring a couple things to you my title here this today is rely on God rely on God great big letters in neon sign before you this morning real I rely on the word rely on God creator of heavens and earth giver of every good gift amen rely on God I don't want to diminish that thought this morning rely on because there's no absolutely no other way now let me just read a few things before we get into the reading of this I want to pass a few things on here rely means to rest on something to have confidence in to trust in to depend on you know that man was made not to shift for himself do you know he was made to rely completely upon God and do you know this message this message has who has and Christ had paid the redemption and caming take the book to give back to the bride everything that Adam and Eve lost that ripe and brother Bram said it has been delivered so where are the people of this open book where are the people that have this at partakers of this growing into it that are living a normal Christian life not the abnormal one of the world but the normal Christian life a walk of faith they're gonna preach on this morning I didn't say that I do I couldn't do it what is normal I'll tell you what normal is the original life this it ends whether you're seeing God's I am normal or the words no okay I want to get sidetracked here so rely means to confidence in having confidence in trusting in depending not independent from him but depending dependence on him as you're facing perilous times now we've heard that for years but we're coming in to see just a little view of it just a little everything that's happening is working for the brides good it's got to all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are called thee called according to his purpose I don't care what's happening how much you're hurt how much this and how much that and you can't do what you used to do and everything it all works together for good and sons of God are led by the Spirit of God right now all this is I don't even know where this this out this is I think the things out things that are to be yes all his works are perfect I've got to give this to you because we're going into a subject here all his works are perfect they're perfect and on time you may not think so your own carnal mind may say all what's wrong why do I always me what was me contracts contrary to the word there's no was you happy am i joyous am i rejoicing and i don't feel like it then get out of your feelings we're not talking about feelings this morning we're talking about the word who I am the word the bride can't be anything else but the word if he's the word the bride is the word alright the word living that means that she is the Reap person the bride is is the Holy Spirit manifested in her and by that spirit will have a change to taking her to a change of her body which her body will become that very spirit in flesh and it is in flesh now but the flesh will become that hallelujah are you with me but see we're looking at it by faith and saying it's it's here it's here you know there's where is it I don't feel it I don't see it you can't see it it's not it's not seen it's spiritually discerned by him that is spiritual when our brother David who do you think you are I am spiritual the Bible said you are he that is spiritual amen go back to first Corinthians to find out if he didn't say that all right now but his works are perfect they're perfect and on time they don't miss one hour sometimes we think they're going to but they don't after it's all over we see it couldn't have come any quicker it couldn't have come any better it's perfect and on time how many's witness that then why should we complain about anything I'm speaking to myself this morning alright our people I'm not I know I won't go there all right that's brother Paul statement all right now this little bride is perfect within and without from beginning to end allured and all his works are perfect and her as summed up and manifested the eternal width and purpose of God though she goes through trials and is beaten and but she's handcrafted of beaten gold she's a form thing and a thing of beauty and joy pepper by the trials and testings of this life alright so don't ever discount testings when you know where you are and who you are and where you're standing every trial and every test has be brought subject to the word and stay there and say God be praised alright know one other thing your birth here was pre-planned I love it your birth here was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows our birth was pre-planned do you know you're being never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you're here he had to know every flea would ever be and how many times as bad it's I that's infinite and your mind can't fathom what infinite means but so he knowed all things therefore there's nothing out of cater we know the hour we're living in what lays ahead we see that we pass and the book is God's revelation of Jesus Christ and his works okay so the book of Revelation is a revelation of Jesus Christ we are the hidden mystery the final complete revelation of that revelation all right now I'm just bringing this to you so you so you understand you don't have to get brought down and down in the mouth so you were pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God you were pre-planned by God he knows all about it it's all been pre-planned planned for many generations back that you would be here this morning he said tonight I'm saying this morning he said therefore the bride in the rapture will come for all right and and it's all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place would set it's all pre-planned he knew it he knew he'd be sitting here he knew what do he knows your thoughts you think people think my goodness they think they can just hide their thoughts oh well nobody knows about this I can just think this and think that and think this and you create an atmosphere every time you think it Amen see because your thoughts speak louder in words in heaven all right now God okay I'll just stop right there he also said another place he said you were you're all planned free your your way in fact this day was pre-planned amen and you know what God will do he'll live the word and when you come up against the barrier he won't go around say well I don't believe that I don't believe brother branham just meant that I won't believe that I'll do contrary to it that's not God that's the devil you can't claim to have the Holy Ghost and disbelieve any word you can't claim to have look only goes to not keep his commandment a men and then you're not hiding anything Amen we judge everything either the spiritual judges all things by the word all right who is that spiritual one the Holy Ghost in you that's who I am that's who you are bright that's the revelation of Jesus Christ in you that's why we speak in his name ask anything in my name it's not a I was named it's an I am Nate it's present tense because that same revelation of that person in you as it was in him we speak in his name who's speaking then is David alright now I'll just leave that now heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away there is a resting place for the soul he said there is a resting place for the soul and he's entered into his rest has ceased from his own Labor's labor ye that you may enter into that rest for the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword so the word is our rest and it can't pass away it can't fail it's perfect to begin with it's flawless you don't need your opinion you don't need to had anything to it take out of it it's perfect all right now jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll do it but sometimes when God performs something and does something we asked for yet it comes in an unexpected way and sometimes in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time but God will answer in his own way if you'll just believe it and you have to know God is sovereign but he's obligated to his word but how he performs it when he performs to you how he brings it to pass that's sovereign we aren't even concerned with that we just know if he said so it's gonna happen that's where you stand all right now so it comes unexpected now lay hold on it don't he said see you must believe it accept it then don't take it back if it doesn't come the way you think it should don't take it back hold on to it lay hold on and say this is it God said it that settles that God said so that's finished no matter how long all right all right okay church age book page 355 that's the first statement I want to read here from now these things might be like I said maybe a little I don't I pray God don't let it be doldrum because it's not doldrums this isn't being read to be dulled room you say well we could read that at home yes you could but I had to bring it to you to read at home I'd bring you in remembrance of it mm-hmm how they'd say Amen that's the ministry all right 3:55 paid page 355 this is in the Laodicean Church age he says ol little flock do not fear they remove remember he reproves and he chastens by suffering sometimes the potter takes the pot and breaks it up and remotes it but brother branham said but it is love there is not that is his love another way of love there is not there cannot be so that's love so never disregard what God is bringing you through just take him at his word and put it over the situation Amen let God have his way and claim your right under the word God many times tests us to see and brings an action to see our reaction because he'll act react on our action if we love him we keep his commandment if we have faith and believe his word and take him at his word it expresses love projects it how do we prove our love to him by believing what he said Amen and there's other things goes with that you can run that in your mind but how do we prove his love for us how do we prove I mean our love for him by believing what he said and conducting or acting upon that word all right now watch so there's no other way love now watch what he says all little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears we'll be bound together now I can say we know if they're bound together even brother branham said they're already Pentecost says many costs all organizations already went in the Confederation of churches already joined way back when he was still here so see they've united they're uniting uniting uniting uniting what are they doing coming together in one group one bundle brother been said be bundled there got to be bundled and they got to be bundled first by the opening of the word it bundles those tears because it brings separation all right now he says here but do not fear little flock he says those tears will be bound together and as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they we'll have a tremendous three-fold strength watch the threefold strength number one one is political physical and satanic empower which he returned to a spiritual political physical spiritual satanic 'el power and they will seek to destroy the Bride of Christ she will suffer but big letters but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the earth for he who loveth his own loveth them unto the end now there's a lot now that's in the three fifth page 355 church age book there's a lot before and after this that you can read I'm just bringing out these points page 359 Oh elect now we're here we know the chaff is to be burned we know that the that the Serpent's seed canes line hates the true seed they'll do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elect ones but they are needed for what's the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat no shuck no wheat but at the end what happens to this chaff it's burned with unquenchable fire and the wheat where is it it's garlic gathered in his garner it is where he is all elect of God nobody else he's speaking to now it's elect elect all elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon God and be strong in his might your be strong in his might your adversary the devil is now even going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watch unto prayer Paul said don't you stop pray if anything you need to pray more and you pray more amen pray without ceasing all right don't stop praying don't you stop praying well I'm in the message I'm all right don't you stop praying you need to pray all the more you can I'll tell you what you got a great big target on you and your elect every bolt of help is against you why because it hates the word because he knows that if this bride takes out of this place he knows he's finished this bride he won't believe it he will not can testify of it he doesn't up that's almost Satan but he knows she will destroy him amen all right why it's the word its Christ all right I say shi'ites he/she is he he is she all right now now but here watch what watch unto prayer and be steadfast this is the end time both the true and false vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning now you can see how close we are I pray that God will just open your idler to see how close are we to our sweeping body change you say sweeping yes the sweep comes over we're God and then we have a time here we're gonna meet our loved ones brothers I'm expecting that any day watch now watch I just pray that this will be quicken to you to rely on God those ripened tears must be bound for the Burney see before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning and they are all joining the World Council of Churches that is the binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two spirits are at work in two vines come out from among the tears start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your Lord

that down brother branham said it and put it in your Bible and see if it's right communism is nothing but a tool in God's hands playing right up well it won't amount to nothing that's exactly right don't fear about that that's something that throw you off the track of looking don't you miss that statement right there that's to throw you off the track everybody's concerned about what the Democrats are doing in there and they're working against the kind of the the the the the the the no the the religious rights watch those two spirits fight with one another I'll get to we're gonna get to it here to watch he said said common is nothing but a tool don't you fear that that's something to throw you off the track of looking see God's brother I'm saying it's throwing you off the track of

with Catholicism what person to fight communism Pope John is calling for all the churches to come back he calling the daughters we know mother they will and they'll unite themselves together it's exactly what thus saith the Lord you say wait a minute brother Brown be getting off the line if I am God wrote this Bible off the line you've got to have be a Micah on this case now you know he's referring to Micah 400 prophets you got to be a Mike on this case alright see we're at the end carnal world's at the end watch now Federation of churches heading up in the Federation United Brethren

world themselves with the world not spiritual understanding not able to overcome not elected of god to be called out and separated alright now watch same same message going on look at the spirit filled Church shaking off all this now eating on the neck up here the carnal church they're going further and further away but he said now look at the spirit filled Church shaking off all its little nonsense coming up in the spirit in the minority of course coming in the spirit but moving into such a place till it's it's got there to where the Holy Spirit's moving right through it now watch brother but remember what Jesus said he didn't finish all of his works when he was here some of the things weren't completely revealed brother balance said but when he went up and met John in the book of Revelation he said all of it was made known now watch and he said he said now he said but now brother Brown said but now he comes back in this day and he now works in and through his bride he does alright now watch where the Holy seat seat minority of course and the rest of them oh excuse me moving up to a place till it's got to where the Holy Spirit's moving right through it working its way ready to receive her Lord ready to receive her Lord and the rest of the organized gone back to the world sectioned off sectioned off going back into Federation moving up into that one Confederate head under Catholicism and there was an image formed to the Beast and image something like it a confederation of church formed with Catholicism them two together work together who's able to make more war with the beast or his image certainly not see so so he goes on to say oh he says it right here at the next thing this is in conference 60 1125 conference report did you notice Khrushchev and Russia means clay eyes our and I'm skipping some of this Eisenhower means iron iron the clay they could mix together iron Romanism clay russia and they still can't mix have you noticed all right they can't mix alright and there and they can't mix even showing it in politics they can't mix alright alright socialism and the church catholicism won't mix all right now you just communism and tomba won't mix with roman and roman ISM all right now they couldn't mix together they can't mix they won't cleave to one another do you see friends the next thing the next thing left is the stone to be cut out of the mountain coming of the Lord to roll onto this image and mash it to pieces and all the kingdoms will be ground and blown away like the chaff on a summer's threshing floor where at the end time brother sister can't you see where we're at listen thus saith the Lord repent I predict three curtains in the name of the Lord now this goes back to what he said three curtains which will be Russia he said with the iron he said one curtain is called the iron curtain will be Russia and then he said watch Red China that'll be a bamboo curtain they're horrible but watch the purple curtain that's rising in the United States and over the world the Roman Empire the cruelest of them all alright remember in the name of the Lord get away from it come away from it anything that's attached to it oh my we could spend a lot of time on that couldn't flee to the rock which one the one cut out flee to the rock the coming of the Lord is at hand we need a conference I need a conference to talk these things over with God the church is at the end of her road now I'd like to read some scripture behold the great Solomon's here this is 62 715 I'm gonna skip a little bit here because of time he said I preached up and down the coast and and he said I've gone as far west the message to the world that the light's gone as far west as it can all right and there's a curtain there he said he can't go no further it's God's time curtain he said being we're talking about curtains then he goes on to tell about the curtains we just read about the curtains but watch you watched that one talking about the purple one you watched that one it's going to take over you be careful it's going to be so deceitful it'll deceive the very elect 'add if possible now he's bringing it right down here what we just read if it was possible now to be left out there wouldn't be much to have to be deceived about with it but when it comes right down amongst us I'm not us here but us message dried believers it's becomes very deceitful but what am i reading here there's a token it takes the token you've got it he said brother Brown said here he said watch two things are gonna happen there's going to be something go through the mighty God will make itself manifest and he said he said The Verge and it's one of the mightiest things that ever struck the earth since the days of the Lord Jesus but it can only be known it'll be so humble that man what man calls mighty God calls abomination but what man calls foolish God calls mighty see how watch it it'll be so humble now the word and bride form is going to be that humble but there's also something else it's gonna appear very humble very religious and claim to believe the message I'm still speaking about Romanism I'm talking about that spirit God's wanting us to see something here to his bride he's speaking to his elect that's why he's got to bring it this way now watch here he said it'll be so humble you'll never MIT you'll you'll miss it if you if you don't have if you're not got the token there to examine it you see you see why we've kept talking about the token all along the token is required the token is the person that the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings forth identifying you as see already in him he got to have the token now now watch I could say a lot here this is speaking out this is out of the message desperation I just read the quote there out of paragraph 32 now watch here he said and all these things hasn't he has he hasn't done through the ages in the church ages he is now doing back to the word because the message and the messages and the messages and the messages has has to wind up in the entire word and in the last day days the seven seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride them who lived back there was not perfect until this church be perfected that's Isaiah that's I mean Hebrews 11:40 unless these seven seals opened up and this great thing is made manifest in that bride don't you see the bride coming price can't you see what he's doing he has to fulfill that in order to meet him in the air that life that word has got to come through the woman the bride in order to meet him without that there's no meeting in the air look at adamant look at Abraham and Sarah there had to be a union to have that son there had to be a change do you not realize there's a union taking place there's a bra coming of Christ he has to manifest himself that way it has to come through that channel in order to have that masterpiece family it's got to there has to be a pregnancy taking place amen to meet to receive the coming son because you bear him you're manifesting him what is the bride manifesting Christ again that would be the missing she has to be the complete revelation of the whole thing in order for the two to be united so you see the coming is at hand this is the mystery and it's so humble without the token you won't get it I'm going to stop right there on that all right so with the token you show you've been accepted when the token of the blood is applied to you you're accepted you're until the token comes you're not permitted on the highway on the highway you're not permitted in the bus line they're permitted on the train or the plane you've got to present the token that your fare is paid that you've come to the blood amen all right a lot could be said there and you realize you've been approved amen now where was I let's get back here with this so we wrap this up we see God uniting himself with his bride until he and the church is the same thing let me back up here you watch Romanism an antichrist isn't that kind that flatly denies everything he said he said it's so close like it's so close like it yeah it's so close I get tiller deceived they're very elected if possible jesus said you watch that that's the thing you keep your mind on that's why he's asking us let go of these so much of this news nonsense and give yourself over to where you should be the open book God has provided that escape God has provided the rapture God has provided the way to go home it's called the message of the seventh angel it's called a message of the bride and the bride is that message Amen all right now let's let's go on we see nations uniting world uniting communism uniting church is uniting we see we see uniting with himself with the bride until he in the church is the same thing same cell person God uniting why why never before since the early age was the pillar fire ever among the people in every forest since the early age you ever see the things that we're seeing today and this was only made possible when God sent the seven seals and give us a sign by it and sent seven angels down out of heaven second Corinthians says that you wonder where he gets that from second Corinthians 1:7 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on they said as a judge ain't vengeance on them that know not God and who may not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints to be admired in all them to believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day this day wherefore see wherefore we pray always for you that your God would count you worthy of this calling and it and fulfill the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ then he goes on to say we beseech you by the coming of our Lord hallelujah all right now so watch this so it that sent seven angels down other heaven come to bring back that scattered word in them denomination scattered word what is the sky bring them back where loosen take it back to his perfection bride all right now watch he said scattered work from them denominations and tie it right back into the Word of God to bring down his Holy Spirit the person the Jews now watch he said he's I'm not trying on time stalling here because I want to make sure I just hit the places that need to be communism he's uniting to destroy the church and the that's not Church bride that's church Rome Raman ISM is uniting to destroy the church that is that is after the church has United itself to in the Council of Churches now watch they're uniting to destroy the church but it's after the church nominals the church denominations have joined themselves in the world council so see how far down the line you are because now we see communism uniting to destroy the church right in front of us it's right in front of us it's working and we get our eyes so caught up in this and caught up in that and we met and brother Graham said that's the ploy of the of the Romanism working down behind the scenes to keep you looking at that to miss this alright now watch he said he said that after the church is united to in the council of churches the World Council of Churches they have to unite to deny and to destroy the message the word and they did before brother Branham even left they had already put him out and he said it's thus saith the Lord you're dead and you'll never rise again you shut him out and the earthquake and in in Alaska said that was the official that was the official sign that they had put him out see they're just I hope you realize we're further down the line maybe you think now watch here we're watching something unfold it's a drama and it's been unfolding but it's unfolding clearer and clearer and clearer and you're clear and you see you go back to what he said you say my goodness there it is all right now I'm just got just a little bit more time watch I'll listen I know you are thank you god bless you they have turned down the word the churches had they cannot accept it because it's against their denominational Creed no matter how many pillars the fire would hang in the midst of people how many people how many things would be foretold in happened all the great signs he promises us say they cannot do it therefore therefore they are uniting themselves now this is in the Uniting time and sign 8 1863 paragraph 57 therefore they are uniting themselves now and your pastor here many can tell you that's reading that they that they are have the ekam they have the ekam unikom movement of the world and there's a Lutheran minister over it now watch what he said that if there comes a disaster would happen in this neighborhood here if we're not united with that eka miracle move then our church can be no more be Church and they can use it for a storehouse now am I saying that what happened no but it's your leading that way if they can do one little thing she Satan doesn't come all at once just throw the whole thing out little by little but that's the way the god bride takes the land to little by little it just keeps opening watch them they can do that whether they can do next if they do that what they can do next him I take you scared no fear not because oh he who loves his own loves them to the end you have nothing to fear anything just get in the word stay in the word stay with the word don't give way to nothing anything this contrary the word separate from it it brother Browne said anyone anything anybody that is 2 draws you away from that word contrary to that word he said leave it don't had nothing to do with it all right remember the Prophet said he said God's Word calls for a total separation from unbelief all right now you people he said what do you what am I what's he asking you to do stand with the word rely on God all right you people okay and he goes on to say if any brother or anyone a minister would give spiritual blessing we could be shocked for it it goes on down the line okay now super sign 7/8 62 and you people I say I've got to say this don't let nobody poke something down your neck about communism okay we know that let's just keep moving here it isn't communism that's going to rule Roman isn't going to rule all right he said there's three curtains he talks about those three curtains again Oh can't you see the whole thing facing into it the church unless see there's got to come a falling away first I already Express that why there's come a falling away we've already see it happen confederation of churches will form the image of the beast we know that all the churches uniting are unite themselves together to fight communism don't you worry about it it ain't going to - it ain't going to be the thing to fight we realize there's only no now this is Messiah 1 1761 father the hour has come we realize there's no way for us to find anything no place to go now but only to Jesus keep that in mind we were at the end time we see all these things taking place we see our nation just at bankruptcy authority is they just keep printing more money it's not worth anything keep borrowing how far they gonna keep borrowing when they run out all right now watch but watch something got to come in alright as you see what's happening he says we're at the end time we see we see our nation just at bankruptcy we see our world at bankruptcy we see communism sweeping in an ungodly spirit called the iron curtain we see one rising under China called the bamboo curtain then we see wonder eyes under the purple curtain room taking the whole world now you remember this that these things are your promises you promised us these things in the evening time we're so glad you're making your word fulfilled in our lives now I got about a page and a half I'll just bear with me I've got some things out of this church age book about another 15 20 minutes can you bear with it it's got morning it's morning we're still early it's not night nobody just I you know stay awake you missed something go back a minute I think it's that important study it out take your time all right now I wish I could take my time but I can't take my time but God's a lot at the time honey believe he's in that control that's it absolutely says that will well well we'll all join together one big cause to fight communism that's exactly what they're doing brothers sister they're moving that direction said they say they say we'll all join together in one big cause to fight communism and they don't know that God raised up communism and even put it in their minds to avenge the Saints of the blood that they that they had shed upon the earth praise the Lord God organized communism just the same as they did King Nebuchadnezzar to chastise Israel he raised up communism and some day she'll blow Rome Pope off the map God raised up communism he said so that she'll blow Rome Club plumb off the map how many has ever been in the Vatican we've been to the Vatican we stood at Ground Zero talk about jewels talk about gold it's his own city governs his own self has its own currency now connecting with another no nation she's the nation in her own amen ground zero be blown off the map praise the Lord praise the Lord you say well how would she praise the Lord all the people dead I'm not talking about the people I'm talking about that ungodly organized system that worms this way right down here and tried to sieve the people even though even to lift up a prophet and worship Him worship over his books as Bibles his gun is this and that having museum they can go into and pay their tithe into it tell me if that's not Romanism that's the truth you say that's harsh it's not harsh that's the truth they put the word on a different cart it's not supposed to be on the cart half brother's drove the cart see the words perfect the other sister I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the spirit of thing the spirit of thing is Romanism this here thing is Catholicism and it's an organized system and that system won't take all the word they can shout they dance but they can not and will not receive the word for the hour and anybody that does is their enemy thank the Lord I'm glad to be that enemy of that thing because that thing is my enemy it's idolatry okay we'll continue reading I got some more to read here clock lot closer than this we've been reading listen now I'm will close on it now well we'll join together see chastise Israel now we know we know we know J who was raised up to destroy what do you destroy a hab jessabelle that's what J who's part was anointed for that part God honored his zeal to kill and put it in his mind to kill that Jezebel it's like he said about it you could type it again in Nebuchadnezzar's chastising israel for her rejection and her idolatrous worship of her pagan idolatry see you can't mix you can't mix idolatry into this work this is a pure word this is the bride's head this is her husband this is the word we have no other no other thing to bow to but that word that living word hallelujah amen don't even allow it to come in your lives don't even don't even answer to it anything contrary though don't you let the devil put fear in your life by being afraid to stand up against anything contrary to the word when you do so by the spirit it's done in love but it may not be done like they think it ought to be and you preach the word under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and bring forth a word of faith for this season that is love being projected to the people it's the light upon the pathway to set you free hallelujah Amen alright I'm thankful for the message my goodness but just not on letter form just not a book form but it's becoming alive in the bride she sees what's happening oh my he says all right don't you pay attention to that iron curtain you watch that purple one read foxes the martyrs and you'll see this you know what she did you watch when the bride takes her leave you think sparks didn't fly you watch Inquisition then tell you who's ruling and we've got people rights and then right among the Pete right among I say among the message that will blow the whistle on the people believe in this pure word but God has appointed that because God will show there's nothing gonna touch his bride you can't murder her off of that word you can't move her off of believing this truth you can't I don't care what happens just the breath away is a new body it's the word page 265 of the church age book I'm coming down to an end now just bear with me page 265 you see I preach differently in some preachers but leave me alone I feel good this way I'm different but I'm happy all right 265 these are going to be important things so don't get so tired now and lose me now bottom at page 264 it was a keep you I want to bring this in because I think this is very important keep your skirts clean he reads a message he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and then it goes on to say repetition of verse 4 of Revelation I don't I've three for a few who have not defiled their garments now we used to have a saying years ago no doubt was taken from this verse it was keep your skirts clean now listen this isn't this is a diss to be something joking it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved you have one thing to do rely upon God keep your focus on that eternal word that's present among us keep feeding in the book ask God for revelation keep your eyes on Jesus the Living Word the revealed word your husband said someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it now God is going to reward those who follow this advice there okay now I'm jumping down here just about a few sentences down you know we're living in the end time it is the age that the churches are going to come together and they are even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world they you won't be able to buy or to sell now let me just back this up a minute okay I've got that coming okay keep that in mind you won't be able to buy or sell you will lose all because brother manna makes a comment on that and buying and selling let me just tell you right now he said thank God the church will be enjoying your great three and a half years in glory don't have to go through that so I want you to realize how close are we may be I pray not is that door closed I don't know and you don't know and nobody conjectures it but what we do say we know the bride's still here so we knew Mercy's here for those that can hear the word and still mercy to offer it to the others even brother brown said you would even be preaching the souls in prison third pull lot could be said about that too couldn't it okay now let's keep going but watch what he says he said you lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement this world system of church orders will be physically bereft burette means deprived of lacking something we must see that's what the graph means deprived of or lacking something be physically physically bereft not spiritually physically he said there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in watch this preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give in to the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the judgment they will be found naked they will not be given why those white robes neither will they walk with him I don't know how much the bride's gonna face this but I do know one thing we won't give in it's just all there's to it you say what's gonna do how close is it brother Davis said close the token will discern it you say where is your confidence in him not in me not in my reasoning not in my thinking not in my feelings not it my not having or having or not having every day it's in him I pray God give us grace never to move from that spot and we won't if we're elect seed and Christ is revealed in us because you can't receive Christ then Christ leave you can't have Christ in you then taken out of you that's all there is to it once you're in him and he's in you identified you're accepted you're already approved you're already approved all the way out to the rapture all the way into the resurrection right in the rapture right into the Millenium rightful millennium into the new city in the new city they're beyond ternal already settled it's already sealed in the other day of redemption yes getting back here preachers will give in and the people will follow these false shepherds right in the slaughter but in the judgement they'll be naked they will not be given white robes neither will they walk with him in the judgement do you see brothers sister in the judgement Brides not being judged all right now the people will follow okay now you can't you can't you can't walk with spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up hear the voice of God crying come out of her organized religion organized religion brother we're not having Methodists Baptists Presbyterians Baptist Presbyterian Catholic spirits are all amongst us here all forming their little religion just adding to something taken away something of this word that's it that's exactly right but you're not you'll do that the bride can't do that how can she deny Christ when she's in Christ how can she deny Christ when she is Christ God can't deny her how she can be nice how she gonna deny him I'm not talking about out here your feelings and your ups and downs I'm talking about that in inside soul that's been resurrected it's already raptured and he that has begun a good work and you also finish it we say book devil the rapture is already in progress who devil boo he that started a good work and Mees gonna finish it hallelujah alright my people ve not partakers of her sins that you received not of her plagues Amen God is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plain leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance in the blood of the Lamb but do it now tomorrow may be too late alright now let's go to page 313 what's this this temptation is exactly like the temptation that Eden's it will be very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition of gods commanded word watch what the opposite watch what this temptation it'll be a very inviting proposition you know Eve was and it was very inviting she wanted a reason she was she wanted to know why God said that and he gave her a reason don't you add your opinion don't you even try to add your opinion don't think brother branham it that he meant exactly what he said and you leave it alone unless you don't understand leave it alone don't put your interpretation to it if he said the scripture meant this believe it he took a scripture he took it back over here he said admit this who are you to put your opinion to that scripture and her to that prophets word and say it didn't mean that prophets are the very interpretation of the word don't tell me you dot if you don't believe that then you don't believe he was vindicated prophet of the hour who the Word of God comes to all right now so watch quit putting our interpretation don't put your thought about it don't put your opinion on it direct opposition just like he did Eve to gods commanded Word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right and so enlightening and so life-giving to fool the world watch this thing coming up to that so simple why brother we lose all well I'll just let me read it here okay life-giving only the very elect will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows ooh now we have a heads up here's the way the temptation is going to come he told us yes sir it's gonna be just like it wasn't Eve yes sir it's gonna come right now I'm very religious yes sir it's gonna be an organizational something and it's gonna be so right it's gonna fool because it's gonna look so reasonably correct why certainly he didn't mean that he meant this you better get the token brother sister you young people I'm not talking somebody above your heads you've got to have the token we can't be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and don't you stop there you go on to the word and say God you promised me to fill me with the Holy Ghost I'm not gonna see steady you're not gonna be satisfied until I'm filled and I know that I know that I know that I know you're living in me period don't you take this message as some religion that your mommy and daddy believes don't you take this is just some religion this message is a person Jesus Christ amen there's nothing else nothing less it's what it is and it's your only way to get out of here you will never you will never make the rapture because you believe this message as a religion because it's what we believe in the house because my mommy and daddy do you're not saved because your mother and father are your say because you have personally accepted the blood of Calvary to be your way of escape and believe that that blood is shed of life and that life was meant for you and you've got to be filled with it hallelujah you accept it no other way don't you let the things of this world there's nothing as important as meeting him in your soul it's okay if I spit in snot and I'm sorry but look at how it's preached listen to what's said watch what he's continues on to say now here's the here's the temptation the ecumenical move is there any question now that there is an economical move that started on what seemed to be a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one mother Bram said not that one but one with the word one with the anointed word in you that's the one this God expects alright what the Pope says oh I'll look at brother my brothers and sisters come and be one with us Jesus prayed we'd all be one one with what it's not the word now that we all might be one he said that principle that movement that temptation that move becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to the principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches it's a less under direct or indirect denomination domination of this council I could care less because I am the church you are the church this is a building we come together as God said to do to come together thank God we still can but we come you come I come as a part of that church and we come to bring strength for one another strength that we bring is that is the Holy Ghost revelation of the hour spirit of the word living there's no strength we have no strength in herself it's only him the Bible didn't say here you her it was here you him all right all right but under her under him she's the final word yes now watch this that would we go on little groups will lose Chartres privileges they'll lose all property spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Ministerial Association approves in many of most cities one cannot run a building for religious services to become chaplains in the armed services etc it has now mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will said twice it's hard it'll be higher it will be harder to resist for to resist it's the loose privilege so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel that it's better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization then not to serve God at all publicly organization was the mark of the beast you see that a denominational system the mark right there it is well well let you will let you keep why will even lift up the prophets name for you let you keep that will let you well let's just serve God I'm it just just do the do the things we require here no problem you can still propagated but he said they would rather work in the framework of this organization that does serve God at all publicly but they do err to believe the devil's lies to serve Satan even though you might want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be fooled furthermore as the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast the Saints will be gone in the rapture now where are we look all close as this move becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the rapture now that can we we can say we're already gone the rapture but we say we're not gone in the rapture spiritually I'm gone in the rapture physically it's got to catch up what are we looking for change in my body I'm looking for what's already begun in me that's revealed in me that's already started in me I have the substance of it I got the very evidence and I'm included in that body change amen all right and this little delightful wine some movement that started out as in fellowship and Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic and Protestants and coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privileges of buying and selling whereby they will make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlot daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds all the paper at the right time all the paper at the at the right time the harlot will destroy the present excuse me the Jews have bonds and all the paper periods at the right time the harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into an alliance and the harlot Church will take over the whole world brother Branham said before she comes into that Alliance the church is gone she goes up I forget the exact word goes up or gone that's exactly right so brother's sister this isn't the story we see this thing how long I don't know when I don't know that I know we're here I know we're here any time that last one may be in I don't know I can't know you won't know I don't know but it'll tell it eventually yeah I just pray God let me preach like there still can and tell the truth of the hour okay you trapped the harlot Church we'll take over now let me just let me hurry right here now okay now I'm moving right down now third seal first seal three 1863 now when he when he gets all the money under control he will break this covenant with the Jews that's after he gets it all in control the bride's gone he'll break the covenant with the Jews that during that three and a half weeks three and a half years covered with the Jews as daniel said he would do it in the midst of the last three and a half last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel that's three and a half years then brother what will he do he will have all the world trade the Commerce a pact with the world because he will hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time then two prophets will rise on the scene that's that's revelations 11 Moses Elijah and called that hundred and forty-four thousand then what will take place then the mark of the beast of revelations 13 will set in because he holds the Commerce trade and everything of the world and what will take place then the mark of the beast will come that no man can buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast thank God the church the church will be enjoying a great three and one-half years in glory don't have to go through that page 367 or 376 I'm sorry church age book I'm sorry I don't mean that I just but I'm so close to finishing up I can't stop now 376 now watch how can all this go to there yeah I would suggest the same time that you read you read also with 375 with it now he talks about as the image erected to the Beast okay Roman or its revelations we just talked about that and he talks about him that has wisdom let him count the number of the beast 666 I saw that right above the throne right and right the Vatican norm Roman numerals exactly what he said but she was headed she was healed of her death stroke that that's Rome talking about how she was healed up came paganism became a religious system she joined to the nominal church Church okay - I may just pass up here let me get town Rome is not going it alone let me just put it this start right here her daughters are right with her and she will take over our over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches where's their authority who's she speaking through a religious system with with which looks like the Blessed principle watch this now you'll take it over this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics well what do you know all right and at the opportune time will manifests exactly how great is that control watch these words the eka miracle move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not envision it that way well I thought the mark of the beast was I thought the Beast was the take oh I thought the Antichrist was to take over well it is but they how can this nice quiet congenial religious man that loves everybody all the Protestants want us all to become one how could he be Antichrist the personage of Satan now watch they didn't envision it that way so in revelation 17 it states the whole the Mystery Babylon seeded the Beast she's controlling the last and fourth Empire the Roman Church is doing that with the world church system under her rome will control will rome will be controlling and this image church system is the image will be obedient to church to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world thus all the people will have to belong to the world system or be at the mercy of the elements they cannot buy or sell we've been through that I'm just going ahead now okay the mark well without the mark of the beast in the hand or the head the mark in the head means they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism etc and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world Church with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it and before the Antichrist in person takes over the complete world system the churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the Lamb amen all right all right I'm just gonna back see if I need to get this I think we about done now fifty-two I'll just read this part this page 352 without the baptism of the Holy Ghost now young people everybody you can never have your eyes opened to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the Spirit is blind to God and his truth I would say don't you let nobody wife husband children friends anything keep you from meeting him if you have that pull down inside of your soul if you know if that's calling you give your life reservedly to him say Lord I can't be satisfied until you come in and reveal yourself to me in me do you love him see if I can close this off right here the ministry will soon will end soon the expected son will appear himself that's exactly what we're looking for the church has come from justification through Lutheran sanctification through Wes leads into the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the Pentecostals and now winding up to the headstone ministry that's bride time bride age headstone ministry typing all the time right into that perfect into that perfect he said typing all the time right into that perfect he said negative shadow becoming positive brother Branham said it's becoming more from the negative to the positive all the time then Jesus will come to catch his church someday those who believe separate yourself from unbelief and believe tonight will you do it every church age every star every minister through every age every angel to the church has done made its manifestation he included the seventh one in them and did you know this church age has only is the only church age that Jesus was put out of his church and found knocking on the door trying to get back in was the latest a an age don't you see the hour we're living see what we're living friends what's the matter with you people can't you see we're at the end time it's all over the next thing will be a sweep that little group will come together in a month or so she'll be gone a sweep while we're looking for a brother-sister I'm looking for a sweep wait you're looking for brother David I'm looking to maybe walk down that trail some morning I'm looking to meet my loved ones I'm looking to be a sweet come over me you say you positive that very positive very

further into the kingdom of God you better get it right now amen while we look not at the things which are seen but are the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen amen she'll be gone as soon as she's gathered together you know there's a gathering coming before we meet him in the air there's a gathering hallelujah

at the end there's no hopes left nowhere watch now he said run to Christ people run to Christ people that's I didn't tell you where that was did I die here where that was found that that quote right there that's found that's found in letting off the pressure 5 1862 the one before that was 120 164 I think I gave the first seal the one before that okay that one in God's Word calls for total separation from unbelief negative shadow becoming positive that's paragraph 220 letting off the pressures paragraph 112 he 112 that's not a book so you have to go to the computer alright one one twenty two twenty yeah one 2164 god's word calls for total separation from unbelief okay then then what I just read to you here was that one it was 112 letting off the pressure run to Christ people
