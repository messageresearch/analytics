maybe still traveling so anyway we just thankful let me discern my own notes here um anyway i want to announce to you that sister jerry and i uh and sister elia will be traveling to monmouth oregon to um preach or minister the weekend for brother rich some meetings there with them and so um we will be gone this coming sunday amen and uh we have some things here that uh we've been working on you know in the basement i would encourage each one of you i know uh tomorrow evening uh we'll be laying carpet again and would certainly appreciate any any help that we could have so i just encourage you to come do that and uh so we want to remember brother scott i don't know that we had a prayer request for brother scott we want to remember brother scott not feeling well um i don't see sister yulia and sammy here today so possibly whatever that circumstance might be just remember them in prayer and as i said about uh sister julie's brother uh pavel and his new bride joy uh we're gonna be traveling west and i don't know if they delayed their departure i know the weather has not been very good uh through wyoming again so just remember them for traveling mercies as they get to start and enjoy this new life together good to be in the house of the lord today amen let's just turn to the word this morning i want to talk to you on the two sides of obedience and you know everything that's happened recently i say a service or two ago but uh it's been a while here but i i preached you on mary's kind of faith now you see god always works on all sides and so here we have that counter balance as it was in this equation we're going to speak to you this morning on joseph's kind of faith and uh so he was there as a type an anti-type we see how this comes and we just want to be concise this morning so let's stand and go into the word of god but first i want to turn or take my original thought as i did on mary's kind of faith from first peter 1 1-9 and we're looking at this my brother and sister and understanding that as time gets further and further along now when the prophet of god prophesied that america would be bankrupt you know he said that it already was but we can look now at the acceleration of time my brother and sister now the prophet of god brings us into the scripture and shows us very clearly that when the scripture is talking about time being shortened my brother and sister people sometimes get that idea that god had to shorten the time to save the people and the scripture puts it thus but remember this principle god will not take an immature bride so as time is shortened this bride under the light of the sun is maturing very quickly she is coming to this place of maturity where this relationship that she has with jesus christ is is coming to fruition now there are some things that you could as a farmer you could harvest and then you could you could find a way to deal with it in an immature state but my brother and sister wheat is something that lies in the sun until it's ready come on has to lie in the sun amen first peter 1 1 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithya elect according to the foreknowledge of god so these strangers my brother and sister are actually only strangers in the fact of an unnamed and uncounted number otherwise they're not strangers to the word elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ and now pardon me for interjecting a couple of these things but the prophet of god said that no person will make it there absent the blood so i want to dispel some myths that float around that god would just take this person because he was a good person no no the blood has to be present he clarifies it only takes one drop the power of the blood is not as it were in quantity as to be drenched or but just one drop thank you lord amen sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplying blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible now my brother and sister this inheritance doesn't become incorruptible over there it is incorruptible here now amen and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god can someone say thank you lord who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time and i want to take out of verse 5 right there if you'll just give me a little bit of grace here not to change the word of god but to change it in this fashion for you to understand who are kept by the power of god through faith into salvation betty ready to be revealed at the right time are you with me amen for you it might be in a certain situation here for me it might be entirely this different situation the seasons of our lives are different but we can say that in the last time in the right time for you and i it will be manifested you know some bloggers sometimes they'll say things like we are so sad at the current state of the message i see where they're coming from but i'm overjoyed i'm excited about the current stage or state of the message amen closer to jesus christ than ever before more faith in this word than ever before now my heart breaks that other people are slipping away but i'm telling you there's a bride who's been drawn closer and closer in fact she's so close she has went down to the threshing floor she has lifted the blanket and she has laid down at his feet and declared unto him do with me as you would hallelujah just waiting for the word you go don't you love that you go i'll take care of everything else she didn't have to go down there and say okay naomi i better run down get a marriage license and i better go make sure all the witnesses are going to be in the courtyard today and i better this and i better make sure he wears a pair of slip-on shoes no sir she just said he's got it all in control no sorry to keep you standing i'm just excited this morning so excited i fought with the wife before i come to church amen hallelujah amen i'm telling you the devil rared his head up and you know i got all bent out of shape over cat food come on i just want to be honest and then i got bent out of shape only that was me being bent over my father's knee and being corrected hallelujah so after i got bent out of shape i got bent out of shape amen to an inheritance let me re-read this because it just really means a lot to me this morning to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for everyone else for you who are kept by the power of god through faith into salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through your manifold temptations of the cat food no the devil anoint anything he can anoint he don't care what it is that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold the paris though be tried with fire might be found into praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ oh my brother and sister and we're going to tie this appearing today together in a little bit different fashion amen whom having not seen ye love aren't you glad something in your heart is i love you lord in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls i want to go back to verse 8 and read it again to make an emphasis whom having not seen ye love in whom though you now though now ye see him not yet believing amen you rejoice with joy and speakable and full of glory heavenly father i pray you just help us to articulate speak this today lord may you come down and anoint your word let us speak only thy word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints so as we look at this we realize that not one of us will finish this race without having our faith tried and it is something that we must grab or grasp the halts of with a steadfast conviction it must be something that we are gripped in our soul not just for a season many times and it breaks my heart but you'll see people serve god for seasons and then go away and we pray that the season will come again in their life will they'll come back in repentance to the word but we have to have a steadfast conviction and this steadfast conviction my brother and sister is necessary to unlock the power of the word amen to unlock uh the revelation of the word you can't just have a half-hearted approach uh to uh the word of god for this hour and say well if you know um there there are things i'll just save that a good analogy but i'll save it for a future service but you look at this and realize that you cannot truly serve god as a committed christian without having an absolute steadfast conviction that the word of god is for you if you just believe that it's well you know this is mom and dad's religion this is uh convenient uh this is what then it it will limit my brother and sister what you will gather from the word of god and as i said we we had a service uh just a few past speaking on mary's kind of faith and uh we want to speak more on that subject uh in the near future but we'll look at that and just to recap that a bit my brother and sister as mary is there now it was prophecy it would have been taught amongst the faithful uh of parents um mothers to their daughters that someday there will come a time when the messiah will come and he'll come through a virgin birth through a young girl and and you know it could be you sweetheart so live your life to uh be such that it could be you and so israel would have had a host of of young women young uh daughters that would have been saying you know could it be me and no doubt amongst those there would be some that would say no for sure it's not you daughter you got a little rebellious spirit you're this you're that you're not pretty enough whatever it might be as it is that people have misguided things of judging but you know you look at this and and see and then others would have been just actually on the other end of the scale honey there's no one in israel it compares to you you're the greatest daughter ever you're going to be the one but yet god had already if we believe in predestination god already knew mary he already knew everything about her and while no doubt a very humble family as history would say not a very well-off family but it was there that god was laying down inside of her little things of her life that was being anchored down to where she just knew if this word said it amen if the word said it it would come to pass we believe the prophecies of the prophets and and we hold to those things as being the word of god and so it was there that she had been you might say raised in such a fashion that she understood there would be a girl one day now my brother and sister i don't know if this has happened to you i know at the time that god healed my foot many years ago uh it was such that as i was standing there in the service i knew something was happening now i didn't know enough to stand up and say praise the lord saints god's just healed my foot but i knew something was happening now the manifestation of it was just a few short days later i knew god had healed my foot but you know i believe that mary must have known there was something something you might say tingling within her that that she had a purpose in life she wasn't just a common girl but maybe she didn't have direction of that maybe she just thought you know i'm going to live my life as a faithful wife and mother teaching my kids i'm going to raise them in the fear and admonition of the lord i'm going to be the best mother i can be and she had conviction of those things that she believed in and so it's there that she was committed and it is there certainly that something started to happen in her life and as we know this scripture we won't go back into it but then when the angel comes gabriel comes to her and tells her you know you have found exceeding favor saints do you realize the age that we live in when you look at the world around you we cannot deny we have received great favor in the eyes of god great favor and certainly she speaks those words that speak so strongly to me being unto me according to thy word and i believe that ought to be every one of us testimony that we could no matter what the circumstance is it's not being unto me according to the circumstance of laodicea don't be it unto me according to how i feel or what someone else has said to me or about me but be it unto me according to thy word you see my brother and sister that kicks out all the negative that kicks out all satan's influence it kicks all of the the prejudice and judicious favor of mankind and brings it right down to the very essence of what this is about and so it's there as as mary was speaking i believe those weren't just common words that she spoke out but they were anointed of the holy ghost and she declared that and that opened the door but you see god must speak from both sides you know there's there's times and and we see circumstances in life and you know it reminds me kind of a funny story young man he was just certain that this young sister was going to marry him and one day he got his courage and he comes and says you know sister so and so before the year's out you'll be my wife she just looked at him i can see it now maybe even raised her nose a little and said well that isn't what the lord told me see god works on both ends right the prophet of god preaching to us about deep calleth to the deep if there's a deep calling there has to be a deep there to respond you see what was the devil's anointing on israel when they come out of egypt you've led us here to the wilderness to die that's not how god works when god calls you out he calls you in amen god's never called the people out to just leave them in a wilderness of sin god never intended for israel to have the response at kadish that they had but they set themselves up to that response not god but yet they walk through the wilderness watching the elders die blaming god for their circumstance which only made the situation worse because they refused come on you know what i'm talking about we refuse to accept the responsibility because you see what happens when we accept the responsibility every son and daughter of god that accepts a responsibility repents you can have a situation and somebody says well this is this and this is that but my brother and sister you'll know whether they've caught the revelation of it whether or not they'll repent when the word is given to them we're not talking about being beaten with the word we're talking about the word coming in love and yet if they refuse to then be corrected the scripture is very blunt about where they stand so god always works on both sides of any situation now look how mary i'm going to just speak this uh don't get too spiritual on me because i'm going to just put this in blunt words uh that that uh would describe here is a prophecy and along comes mary and she fits the prophecy now there's always the old question did the egg or the chicken come first and i'm going to throw this at you just for you to ponder if god knew before the foundation of the world that mary would be the chosen one did mary come first or the prophecy the prophecy did god's speaking it see we think often times that it's the man speaking brings the prophecy but we'll touch it i believe if we get to it here today we'll touch on that you see it's always god's voice it's never the man it's never the man i want you to catch that it's never the man it's always god's voice amen when god chooses to use the man to speak that is the expression of the thoughts of god being brought forth in language as it were in whatever native tongue it might be being brought forth it's god's thought and god's thoughts are eternal so long before there was a mary there was a prophecy that there would be a mary but she fit so perfectly in the plan of god and so now what happens is actually the voice of the angel is the confirmation that it was mary that fit that place in the plan of god in other words mary had to be notified mary had to know that she had been now chosen to fulfill a prophecy that all of israel that was well taught knew every family had gathered around the torah and of the writings and they was there they knew that a virgin would conceive and so now it comes that mary has been notified in this day and age it might be like a knock on the door and here is your mailgram or whatever they call those things and you would open it up and be notified god's thought is so much important that he sends an angel comes down and he doesn't just hand her a letter i i want to get to that hopefully i will maybe i'll just get to it right now he doesn't handle it look my brother and sister we have been handed a letter i hope you get this we've been handed a letter notifying of who we are and we've been handed another letter which we would call the message notifying who we are but the message is not complete until you have met the messenger meeting jesus christ face to face there's where the true essence of the message lies in meeting face to face it is not a second or third hand message it is a personal message we've received the letter and god said i'll come and make that letter real to you we've received a message and god said i'll come and make that message real to you and we said here in faith saying be it unto me according to thy word because i want to receive a revelation of who i am i am not mary to bring forth the messiah but i am the bride to bring forth the very child or essence of the manifestation of the spirit of christ in you we call to bring that out hallelujah the letter my brother oh you're gonna say brother paul i argue with you but the letter alone won't do it the letter won't do it gabriel could have said to mary you are gonna bring forth the man-child you're going to bring forth the messiah but if the holy ghost had never anointed her she could have had all the writing all the writing she could have posted the prophecies on the walls of her house walls of her bedroom and it said yes yes yes but unless the holy ghost fell right because it said this that is within you is of the holy ghost so if the spirit never fell she would have never been pregnated oh my brother and sister we can have all the bible we can have all the message but unless the spirit falls we will never be pregnanted with the word of god in this hour hallelujah so mary fits so perfectly this confirmation comes from an angel now let's look at this as well just go forward here joseph we don't talk about joseph much do we he fit the plan of god just as perfectly as mary did now the word joseph means perfection so here was a man my brother and sister that come right down through the lineage it had to be the perfect lineage well it was perfect language because god made it so i mean i don't know i look at rahab and i kind of question whether that could possibly be good i don't know i mean look where she come from some of us are never going to forget where rahab come from i don't care who she married and whether they let her in the tabernacle to worship or not we know where she came from come on come on i i without really just diving in and hammering on i want you to understand my brother and sister some people have such elevated things of where they come from and who they knew and who they rubbed shoulders with and who baptized them and what church they were raised in my brother and sister it don't matter god said there's a little woman by the name of rahab and i'm going to run a scarlet thread not a brown one not a green one you know cause brown and green would match the rocks a little better camouflaging who she was and what was happening no god said i'm gonna have a scarlet thread it can't be hid it can be seen by anyone who will look but i'll blind the eyes of those who cannot understand and she's there oh my goodness i'll get off track here but just one moment you know there's so many crazy things out here in the world well those two spies knew rahab because they were customers come on what carnal minds can grasp at without catching a revelation that something was tingling in rahab we've heard of israel we've heard of you we've heard of your conquering and we've heard of all these things and the people are shaking with fear but i rahab am actually shaking with anticipation because i believe in jehovah i don't know bible doesn't show it that way but i'm telling you we see all through scriptures where god led by a pillar of fire i can see them two servants you know brother trevor they did their very best to camouflage themselves go back study the scripture and yet there were people that went they're strangers soon and very soon we are going to meet the king well hallelujah we don't belong here we don't look like them we don't act like them we don't think like them we don't sing like them we don't dress like them how are you going to hide you can't before i preach on rahab instead my thought this morning i just want you to know my brother and sister that when that touch of the blood touches it'll be more like what sin are you talking about what sin so joseph fits the plan of god and my brother and sister and we could look at this as though just about any man could fulfill this and and here would be mary as a young woman and we know that joseph was quite a few years older but mary as a young woman and no doubt in school and in the streets city or her neighborhood there'd be a young man who who liked her maybe even thought he loved her and one here one there whatever childhood friends but you see my brother and sister god so ordains things to detail together so perfectly one mind would say just about anyone because after all it was not joseph's seed amen so any man could have fulfilled that but you realize it could not have been any man it had to be a predestinated man who could step into the shoes and this position because i'm telling you i wouldn't want to been that man that was not a that was not an easy position to to fulfill to to walk in now let's go to matthew 1 18 if we would and it goes here now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary see how the word is written now as the incubator mary but you see god's going to stumble the wise he's going to stumble the intellectual it's going to stumble a lot of people espouse to joseph now i want you to understand this my brother and sister this word espoused in our mind see they're already married this is not an engagement because and young people listen to me please when you make a commitment to mary there's only one option to put a halt to that and that will be your father stopping it so you make promises of marriage you better know what you're doing it better not be just a game and if something changes we'll just sweep it all under a rug so see here joseph and mary were espoused together they'd never been together never had relationships they were espoused they were man and wife and it's in that position that god comes he chose the seas and i hope you get this he chose this season and put it in such a place joseph's natural love for mary had grown and come into a maturity that it was not just a fleeting boy whim of a cute girl but this was a deep enduring love of a man who knows this is the woman for me and so god allowed it to come into that maturity at that state because it would take that kind of commitment to withstand what's coming before they came together she was found with child now i'm going to just kind of tell you my brother and sister how it must have been and i hope this isn't too graphic or too strong but i'm telling you here's joseph looking forward at this beautiful young lady mary his espoused wife and you know the day the baby bump shows up and i mean this man is shaken to the very roots of his life because he thought this was the girl a godly girl a girl that prays she reads she studies she is just faithful how can this be and his world now has become shaken to a point that he does not know what will i do what will i do my brother and sister this was not without scandal this is not without scandal and here's joseph he's never been with her you understand the laws such it was in that day that a man step out of turn they were very harsh not this day and age we live in like oh hug them kiss them love them you know live them we'll live with them a while so you know what you who you're marrying uh it'll just be okay god understands none of this nonsense they had very strict rules and there was no exemptions look at this what am i gonna do now you see we can judge the character of joseph by the simple fact that god chose him to be that man to fulfill that position amen and the scripture says being a just man not willing to shame her publicly he knew what was happening was wrong she's with child she's been with someone else besides me and the timing of everything is wrong and and i i still love her but being a just man let me put it this way this was a man that knew what it was to judge and be judged he knew you know what i think we just very quietly we'll we'll go to another neighborhood we'll go to another we'll go on down over here we'll go down over here and then i'll just i'll just put her away she'll have a baby it'll be she'll go out of people's minds no one will know i don't want to shame her i want to destroy her in her own community so he's minded he's starting to think you know i probably just need to do it this quietly let's just do this this quietly but wally thought on these things while he's trying to figure it out himself god says i know the son i chose and i know what it chose him for and i know what he'll go through and i have made him just as i made a whale for jonah i have made joseph for mary for jesus and behold see the difference an angel come face to face with mary there was a commission my brother and sister that wouldn't even be done through a letter it wouldn't be done through any other fashion it was direct an angel which was the mouthpiece of god speaking to mary but now god comes now and chooses a slightly different fashion i believe my brother and sister now i want to deviate and i'm not speaking about me but i can relate to this in a certain fashion here many many years ago jerry and i attending a different church here in the valley certain things were happening and i i i i kind of wished in a way that it would still happen in my life but god come in a certain season and it's like a voice spoke to me and says when you go to church this sunday this and this will happen and i thought well it's just my yeah i gotta get my head screwed on straight here i never said a word to jerry the first time it ever happened but i went to church that next sunday and lo and behold exactly what that was spoke to me and the individuals they were trying to woo us and wind us into a circumstance and because of those thoughts my brother and sister and i put it as thoughts i don't want to call it discernment i don't want i don't want to make a something glorified i just know it was real to me and and it was there and i was like no no sorry i can't go and a little bit of time goes by two three weeks the boy speaks to me again says when you go this sunday you're going to be invited on a trip all expenses paid to go be in a certain deal don't go we get to church that sunday and they're there hey we're going to travel to here and we're going to do that and and our back seat is open we have room for luggage and we'll pay for everything come with us you know what happens the conversation replays itself and you're like this is exactly what that voice said and that happened about a half a dozen times saints and you know what i got to the place it i shouldn't say it doesn't happen too many more it happens in a different fashion let me correct that i trust that voice i trust that voice it never failed me i'm not making some great spiritual thing out of it often times it is simple everyday things of life don't do it and you listen to that voice i'm not gonna do it amen so now look at this here he is this is just the start saints of god speaking to joseph this is not the end all of it this is actually the start god starts speaking to him go down here go over here leave it this time leave now and what does he do he's trusting the voice he's trusting the voice for his hour that god used to speak to him he's trusting that voice while he fought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream why not in person because this was how god chose to communicate with joseph amen god's choice not joseph's saying joseph i love how god always identifies who you are joseph thou son of david joseph would have known yep i'm not just a son and the reference to david is not far off and distant but i am of his heritage i'm of the bloodline you know when the prophet of god speaks about bloodline talk about herefords going up in the mountains and all this stuff saints this is what he's really talking about in another language to you it's about the bloodline if the bloodline is not there then it don't matter what grass you're eating and where you're living it won't matter if the bloodline is not there amen joseph the son of david fear not see what he do identified it up here i'm kind of surmising forgive me but do you think joseph identified it as fear see what the devil's doing in this day and age we live in he's coming down we don't identify it as fear we identify it as issue this issue that issue something here something there but when the angel come he cuts right to the chase and he says joseph the son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the holy ghost now you go prior to this saints little homework everybody for some homework how far prior to this do you find the scripture referring to the holy ghost this is not a legacy where joseph could go back and say well we'll just see what isaiah said about the holy ghost we'll go back and see what what is here what is here my brother and sister you see the holy ghost as terminology is concerned was a relatively new way of expressing right new covenant god expressing himself in a different fashion you don't see joseph saying now i don't get this holy ghost stuff you're talking about i don't know why can you give me some documentation which one of the prophets talked about that but if you have a discerning mind you can go back through the old testament there's the holy ghost there's the holy ghost there's the holy ghost there's the holy ghost there's the holy ghost you see they didn't know god by terminology only they knew god by experience amen so you have people in the day that we're living in saying well no brother meant this when he said this and he meant that when he said that my brother and sister ever get it by experience and you won't be there nitpicking away at all of these little details because you'll know what he's talking about hallelujah amen was conceived in her so he's telling her there's something growing there is something coming to life this baby bump is not of man it is not of this or of that don't be afraid of this this is of the holy ghost and i can assure you the godhead was real to joseph and he said okay this is of god himself will have to happen right then saints faith kicked in he didn't stop and say i need it proven to me you need to be able to defend that statement i need more documentation but faith rose up in the right season and in this as i emphasized earlier in the latter times in the last age it will be the season as you need it faith kicks in and takes the halts of it and you're able to grab the word and say that's nothing but the truth amen it's not some theological approach to the word of god but it's a living word in us growing and coming forth to produce a seed amen shall bring forth a son now shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all of this is done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord and you know we literally could cut that off right there and it would not change the context are you with me you could completely cut that off but god gives clarity he said i spoke it come on give me a little liberty this morning okay i spoke it but i used a prophet to say it hallelujah hallelujah i'll tell you i get excited about it it was god that spoke the word for our hour but he used a prophet to say it hallelujah so whose word is it amen it's god's word hallelujah just because a man spoke it my brother and sister didn't make it his word hallelujah this was done right all of this now he's declaring that all of this was done that it might fulfill the word that was prophesied we go right back to isaiah we go back to zechariah all these different testimonies that have put everything in its right place through this scripture and realized it was god testifying in advance so that there would be a people that would be prepared now it's still shocking look it had to be shocking to mary and it had to equally be shocking to joseph but they've been prepared what had happened a foundation a foundation had been laid and so then something had started to build upon that foundation and when those words struck mary she says that's what this is about amen be it unto me when joseph heard this oh hallelujah my brother and sister when he heard this he didn't have to say give me time to study the scrolls give me time to figure this out now look at this behold this is the prophecy behold a virgin shall be with child she already is and shall bring forth a son they shall call his name emmanuel being interpreted amen god with us not god in the universe not god down the street not god in the attic not god in the basement god with us oh my my oh my you know luke and then bring out other accounts and just for the sake of time we won't go into all of them some of them actually expressed it a little bit better i think luke actually expresses part of this better than matthew does then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth firstborn son and called his name jesus luke describes this that he got up and went and did what the angel told him to do come on are you with me saints i'm telling you it's about time for some of us to get out of our chair amen get up on our own two feet and go do what the angel told us to do amen not sit here and discuss where the comma ought to be or the semicolon ought to be or who has a right to and who don't have a right to but it's time to get up and go do what the angels said do hallelujah that's what this little bribe this is why these voices that are saying oh no the message is in such a mess you know they use those terms critics do mess edge mess of the age i'm like oh that's that's cute you must be standing looking in a mirror right now because i tell you what well i'll just skip ahead and remind you that i already spoke it joseph he does what god calls him to do he goes now look i don't mean to be crass but you put a man and a woman in the house there's going to be some hugging going to be some kissing but joseph had heard the word and he didn't touch her until the baby was born prophet of god said this ministry of this age would not man handle the word of god the bride of christ would not manhandle her amen until she has brought forth christ again he will keep his hands off of the people he will tell them this is what god said this is what we've been called to do let's rise up and do it at once but he's not going to go and manhandle her to bring forth his idea [Music] so here he is he goes and he starts to set a stage and the moment he did it he started burying mary's shame not when the baby was born not when the baby was crucified but the minute it started to come forth in her and be made evident that something had changed joseph bore that shame can you imagine saints his friends coming joseph are you serious are you serious we understand biology we understand human nature joseph she's been with someone and you're still going to take her what's wrong with you joseph and joseph would say you don't understand i had a dream come on i want you to think about how real this would come across i had a dream we all dream joseph it don't mean it's real no you don't understand i had a dream and an angel told me that this is of god amen god don't work that way anymore joseph we're beyond that you need to went down and talked to the priest he's got it all written right there in the message you don't understand yeah we don't joseph you've lost your mind what are you thinking what are you thinking or are you so so caught up in her that that you're you're just but remember where joseph's already been saints that's it he's already been there pardon me for just taking this he's already been there okay mary tell it to me one more time you mean to tell me you were here you went there and you were walking back here and at this corner of the stone wall in the garden an angel met you and said as a virgin you're going to bring forth the son of god and it's of the whole oh mary oh mary i've read about it mary i've heard about it mary but it can't be us it can't be us we know it was prophesied mary but this is you and i and you should hear what they're already saying about you this is supposed to be the son of god it's going to be so glorious people are going to worship mary and they're calling you words i can't even repeat mary tell me one more time mary i just can't grasp it and mary telling him an angel joseph believe me it's i mary you're betrothed you're espoused i wouldn't lie to you i promised you joseph i've not been with any man and he's pondering he's thinking do you catch that saints did i fly over your head or do you catch that when i got growing in me i never got that seed amen from any man no man gave me this no man revealed what's growing inside of me no man did this to me this is of the holy ghost oh joseph he's pondering he's like oh here i know she's a real christian i know she's a real child of god i know she wouldn't lie to me oh god i can just hear his saints i don't mean to be presumptuous but i can just hear him in the midnight hour oh god oh jehovah what do i do and he falls asleep and he has a dream a dream that is so real saints that if you could ask him today he would tell you a certainty that angel was standing in my room amen come on oh my brother and sister look at this now he knows the girl story's almost too much and all of joseph's friends what's wrong with you you used to smoke used to drink used to dance used to drag race you used to this used to that well you're not going to believe this the holy ghost came come on saints god's real same yesterday today and forever the holy ghost came and he touched me hallelujah i don't have that desire any longer whoa what's happening surely joseph you don't believe that but faith had kicked in and joseph would have told you almost recounting it see people looking with a critical eye don't see it correctly they would be like well he told it before like it was a dream now he's telling it like it was alive like he was awake do you know you've done the same thing absolutely everyone that's ever received the holy ghost tells that story that way the holy ghost came to me met me in a little church met me here and as time goes on it wasn't he met me there he came into me amen amen it goes from impersonal to personal oh you say well you're changing the facts no we're coming to reality we're coming to the realization it's not us walking with jesus through our life amen it's us walking with him because he has become us and we have become him hallelujah oh thank you lord hallelujah and i want to reiterate this i kind of touched on it earlier it's one thing my brother and sister read scripture behold i send a prophet before my face i send a messenger before my face i i send a word to you before my face oh come on saints i hope you can grasp also that it's one thing to read the scripture it's one thing to hear this scripture to hear the prophecies but it's an entirely different thing to be there and watch it unfold it's unfolding around us oh praise the lord the prophet of god said the united states to be bankrupt we're seeing that prophecy come to pass that's good that's good what about the one that's prophesied that in the time of trouble the time of despair the time when your hope should be faltering that you'll just have enough faith to look up and be able to declare my redemption draweth nigh oh the world's like uh it's coming to chaos i love that song our young sisters thank you for singing that beautiful amen it's getting ugly it's getting dark there's all kinds of nonsense here but i'm not worried about it because this is not my home amen so look we see prophecy come to pass don't worry about it god's just interpreting his word you have revelation to see what is happening amen oh hallelujah now look at this god chose to come in a dream to him but it still left him on through scripture go study it don't study it i'll preach it for you later but you see as time comes on now he's able this voice has become audible to him i want to leave you with this thought maybe you'll do a little studying on this this voice my brother and sister wasn't meant for us to look back back back back the voice was meant to be audible today tomorrow and every day after becoming an audible voice of god telling us come go stop turn right turn left speak an audible voice oh hallelujah my oh my now look i want to jump back does we don't need to go on the screen but just to remind you uh first peter 1 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father is that not an incredible thing when you think about it elect according to the foreknowledge i don't have to convince god amen i don't have to convince you amen i have to rest on the fact that my god the holy ghost coming down speaking in an audible voice reminds me years ago at a setting at a place questions and answers now i felt really bad for the pastor because the person that brought this up's pastor was sitting right there brother paul if our pastor only preaches the basics of the message is it possible for us to have more revelation beam me up scotty but did you know that god has mysterious ways by god's grace the answer just starts coming out your own brain's like going well slow down here huh uh what it did is it ultimately caused the pastor there was no shame there there was no guile on behalf of the person asking the question and the pastor was like i need to get deeper i need to get deeper i i i'm supposed to be leading amen still they had a little reconciliation out there on the edge of a driveway and pastor walked away not feeling real happy probably but i'd stand on the answer i gave amen because it was the word amen it was the prophet's words and you see my brother and sister we we're not here just eat chicken soup the rest of our life amen we're eagles aren't we amen can the eagles show me their claws hallelujah amen we're made to grab the meat of the word hallelujah and i pray all the time lord help me be able to dig deeper i'm not a real deep preacher but i tell you i want i want to get in there i want to at least be able by example if not by words by example show you how to dig these claws into that me and take a bite out of it hallelujah oh yes amen but look at this i need to hurry along in this an incredible little revelation here joseph met an angel in a dream i'm just going to say he met an angel because i'm telling you this wasn't some vague fuzzy dream this was a very specific right down to it and so joseph meets an angel but joseph had to come to the revelation saints just like you and i he he named me he named me this is not them over there this is not maybe them down there this is not maybe a back east where there's way way more message believers so there must be way more anointing this is me joseph and i'm called to take mary get this to protect her god gave me a commission to protect mary god gave me a commission to love mary gave me a commission to feed mary and clothe mary are you following me yeah somebody's got to do it amen and when you catch the revelation god's talking to you and says somebody's going to be the overcomer of this age ah he's talking about me he's not talking about them he might be talking about them but he's talking about me oh come on my brother and sister i hope you catch this analogy of mary amen she's the one carrying the seed and i'm here today to feed protect provide for and and be with and you know what another thing god anointed him oh i'm getting excited here excuse me but another thing that was so incredible that reaches out of the word of god that god anointed joseph to look at mary and see no shame amen the world is looking down on that all they see is shame amen you're a cult you're this you're following a man well good i i sprung this on a gentleman's way back he's like wow you guys follow this and i was like yeah okay you're a baptist do you know your baptist history i know my baptist history perfectly who started the baptist church that's right a man did i seen a little quotation in a farm magazine everybody driving too slow is a and everyone driving too fast is an idiot i alone have the correct balance come on saints yeah idiot more on internet perfect idiot perfect let it come to the place look at this now joseph looked at the chosen of god and didn't see any hinder most parts god help us hallelujah it'll change our lives saints oh the devil's got it rooted down into us so deep we justify it well i'm not really criticizing brother trevor i'm just pointing out facts yeah the same facts that are facts about you yeah is that how it works come on come on saints yes sir oh we do all these things about yes you're pointing you got three back at you well as bad as most of you aim the three back wouldn't even hit you because in your own mind you're perfect and you didn't get your facts right in the first place so the one you were pointing out didn't hit the mark either come on but look what god did he put into joseph a spirit of subjection and when he looked at mary he saw himself and christ amen you see my brother and sister i i don't have enough time we'll stall you see as the scripture talks about the coming of our lord jesus christ right there in the natural sense right in in that kind of a what would be the right word for that it hadn't taken place but you see that natural event of the birth of christ was represented spiritually at the coming of christ amen so as the coming of christ the baby as they saw him it was there manifested now in the spiritual coming of christ that all things were made perfect the the atmosphere the stage and the right people to worship everyone was in their right position you see god don't make no mistakes god doesn't say well you know there's only a manger left well why because we're dealing with sheep amen if he wanted to deal with a hierarchy they'd have had a hilton we would have had a room reserved for him but god said nope i want to set the pattern and i'll keep the pattern i'll maintain the pattern because my pattern will never be broken oh hallelujah now let's god in his people this is a mystery to some people they question about whether god's even in his people and prophet of god even saw fit to name a sermon that my the holy ghost dispensation come in and continued on and will continue on by the administration of angels to the church truly but there are ordained spirits of god sent from god to carry the things out every man has a special calling back all through the ages angels has visited men not a worship of angels that's wrong like brigham young and so forth and like some people do but an angel of god will testify to the truth of god that's right and it'll declare god it won't have some kind of mythical something and no one understands it'll speak of jesus christ and testify of jesus christ and produce jesus christ to the people oh hallelujah i'm telling you there is some prophecy my brother and sister that was spoken for our day by an angel messenger of god that said there'll be a people on the earth at the coming of our lord jesus christ that will be worshiping him in spirit and in truth and they can't be deceived according to the word of god and that not being deceived is just not seeing whether it's right or wrong but knowing him in his personal relationship oh hallelujah hallelujah you know i want to share this just silly thing that people do you know so they're like okay we're going to see if we can fool a family they take a professional makeup artist they take a man that is of the same stature has the same walk and everything and he sits down in a chair and the makeup man takes this complete stranger that fits him more or less physically and they take him over and they they do all this makeup stuff even to making the right wrinkles in the back of the hands and everything complexion is just right and the man drives a car in the garage you know and gets out and goes in the house and they've studied they've studied they study these things why would you study these things it's the devil studying and he walks in the house puts his briefcase right on the corner of the counter where the real husband father does and goes in and goes over the refrigerator and gets him a soda the wife comes in gives her a hug tickles the kids on the head just right and the little boy walks up to him and goes where's daddy amen some of them are going to get fooled oh but if you come as a little child amen you come in the humbleness of the anointing of the word in our hour you're gonna look at that and say you're not my daddy and the rest of the story goes on the dog come running in the room stop start growling at him and the woman who's already hugged the man is like going what is going on here anyway she was quite embarrassed and then quite mad but this bride can't be deceived the devil can throw the briefcase down he might have the code to the garage he might throw his briefcase in the right spot know just what soda to get and no just right every move to make but this bride of christ is going to say you're not my husband amen and in fact i'll give you about 32 seconds to get out of this house before i'll help you out of here amen my brother and sister god didn't say now you know you worry about being deceived you find me a spot in the scripture where it says you worry about being deceived i'll tell you you find a place in the word of god where it tells you if you eat the book and you become the book that there's nothing going to deceive you oh hallelujah amen so what happens here it won't have some kind of mythical something no one understands that's a good example of the trinity as they teach it we don't even understand it but you should just blindly follow us oh look a ditch it'll speak of jesus christ and testify of jesus christ and here's the thing my brother and sister now i don't want to go hash into things but i've had people look me in the face and say why do we have to manifest this message well mostly because my prophet told me to well no i let me take that back the word told me to god told me to the prophet just said the words hallelujah produce christ to the people in the people let me hurry i i kind of bungled that up but you you know what i'm talking about amen yeah oh my look at this sorry to dig in on things chris but look we have to have a foundation saints amen the foundation that was there for mary and joseph both was laid long before the angel came to them long before they were asked to manifest this prophecy of god the foundation had been laid and they could settle back on that foundation and everything fit amen hallelujah amen allowed him to seem that his dream mos i mean joseph to see that his dream was not just a dream not just not just you know indigestion or something like that but to see that it was real able to recognize the presence of god in his life and we'll study this out some more and if you want to study it obviously do go study it but you'll see that god speaks to joseph here here here he's sending him over here he's telling him stop go over here sends them from there to here sends them from here to here see joseph hardly gets any recognition isn't that interesting but as the head of his home come on come on i hope this comes out right i got too much humor in me this morning look if nothing more joseph had a hold of the lead rope of the donkey and he's walking mary went where joseph took her oh in times of trouble let it be let it be no i'm sorry mary is not some mythical thing the prophet of god said mary had to have the holy ghost mary had to have a prayer life she had to submit to the word and when she kept coming to jesus and trying to exert her point i'm your mother he would say who are you who are you i don't know who you are but yet on the cross dying i'm getting ahead of myself on the cross dying he points out yay your mother your son and by revelation he knew i'm going to take care of her not because she was the mystical mary because she was a widow a daughter of god you see saints what god's doing but joseph amen the holy ghost had joseph's lead rope that's how the home ought to be let me just say this in closing the holy ghost had joseph's lead rope and joseph had you might say mary's lead rope and so where the holy ghost took joseph joseph took mary and in those formative years as you might say because they truly were formative years god used them to form a character in jesus christ amen the man the flesh and so wherever the angel took joseph joseph took mary mary took jesus hallelujah are you with me oh hallelujah i was sure i wouldn't have enough to preach this morning okay in the message influence and we're just basically right here to be done in fact sister emmy if you'd come please and that's the way many times that's that's what i think has got the world today in such confusion men go out and try to take those places which they're not ordained to do it gets to a spot where they try to fulfill this office and they're not called for that place and i included that because i want you to understand this the events of the time the events of the season requires a certain individual joseph had to have the character except the words of the angel the character to accept mary shame to bear reproach to protect feed clothe oh jesus was jesus was jesus he was the messiah john 1 it was god in flesh let me tell you saints mary and joseph still did devotions they still read the word of god to their son they still prayed with him amen why because god chose that kind of people to fill the role oh he's going to be the messiah he's going to save the world we don't need to do anything we just sit back and watch it happen no i'll tell you what parents with that kind of a spirit on them are the ones that are often amazed why i can't understand why my child walked out of church one day has never come back it's because you never laid a foundation they had nothing to build on the storm started raging and everything they thought do you know that we have a crisis in america christian young men and young women are going to college running face to face with this whole intellectual explanation [Music] and young christian individuals are falling like flies and coming home went to college believing in god coming home agnostics and whatever else why no foundation no foundation no personal experience no understanding that i was called to fulfill this [Music] you know we don't see in scripture where somebody else showed up and said joseph you're in the wrong place i'm supposed to be mary's husband [Music] you know why noah did that well i personally believe i'm just one of those crazy guys i think mary must have been a very very pretty girl i just i just believe that don't ask me why i can't prove it i just don't think that you know god chose a broomstick i think that he he dwelt in a beautiful lady just leave me to my delusion [Music] would have been as i said earlier many young men would no doubt have wanted ben mary's husband because of mary and her character but no one no one wanted to bear mary's shame and disgrace now look at this this jesus called christ the prophet of god said what are you going to do with him you see my brother and sister at a distance he's beautiful and everybody wants to be married to him seven women everyone wants to be married they don't want to bear the shame and reproach they want to share the prosperity and the beauty and the joy and all of this and all of that they don't want to bear the shame but you've got to bear the shame to receive the glory oh hallelujah hallelujah my let's stand up and sing a song or two amen you see each one of us got to have faith not just for a moment saints we got to have faith enough to play out our part now i don't mean to put anybody on the spot but do you want to have faith enough to play your part that god called you amen he called me to be the bride of christ in laodicea it's 2022 when i was a young person like these here my there was just no way i was ever growing up i was never going to get married while when i was that age i was like i can't even get a girl to smile at me but anyway um you know i'm never going to get married i'm never going to have a family i'm going to never this and now i look around and the brothers are like man you're old brother adam the other day called me a geezer i couldn't think of any retort so i

sorry but i just want to drive this point have any of you saw the video before of the young man they're all young when they race like that young man in a race i think he tore a hamstring or something like that and he's you can see the finish line he's not going to win the race all these little healthy people and he stops and he's there and he's hobbling and he stops and he puts his head down and he looks up and he saw a finish line and it was just right down there and he just starts and you know oh i hope this touches you like it touches me the security police tried to keep father off the track and his dad climbed over the fence in the grandstands over the fence surrounding the track pushed a couple security people out of the way ran out there got a hold of his son and helped him to the finish line you realize that's what our lord jesus christ is doing with us there's nothing going to stop us saint you say i don't know i can't make it brother paul the trials are too great the circumstance is too great don't worry he's on the scene amen the answer is already on the on the way god's already present oh hallelujah i gotta stop oh hallelujah lord prepare [Music] you're and holy

you [Music] i'd like to sing that letter word be born in the manger of my heart you know i i just kind of i don't mean to break the spirit or anything but you know brother david i never knew anybody else ever sang that song but our brother david nash and so far as i even thought he wrote it but i tell you what my brother and sister i remember as a young man struggling my way back to serve god brother david would come sit in our home at times play that on our piano and as he was singing that i would sit there and i would cry because i knew that's what i needed i needed not jesus christ on a cross oh understand me i didn't need him to be on the cross saints that work is already done what i needed was to get him back here in the manger of my heart where i could take a hold of him and say lord i love you lord i need you can you just wrap your arms around me can you just can you just speak sweet words to me it was a tiny simple staple oh [Music] hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose someplace special to reveal his majesty so i know if i give him control he'll be born in me let your lord that's our desire today lord help us in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start living inside this house let your word be born in the manger of my heart now i [Music] for his word to unfold but if i'll just heal this vessel and let him from glorion to glory he'll change [Music] live in me [Music] every day let your word be born in a manger of my heart hallelujah hallelujah one more song saints amen i heard joel's army is in the neighborhood amen you know salvation army's a good name my brother and sister if they'd have just stuck with salvation and not had to try to form some program around it but i'm telling you that sons and daughters of god which are the army of almighty god are on a direct commission they don't take their orders from just anyone it has to be vindicated has to be proven and has to be verifiable but when she starts marching oh my does the devil not like it hallelujah [Music] sons of god his preachings ring arise and shine my holy comes in [Applause] we are shall shine with healing in his wings he'll run shake this all in [Music] have you considered my [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] this world shall fall oh bridegroom come [Applause] let's sing that first verse as we close morningstar take care that we sing o sons of god his praises reign [Applause] hallelujah aren't you glad this morning amen you know the prophet of god said that when the the book of redemption was written down it says then it was wrapped up in those seals to be revealed in these last times i'm telling you saints god's pouring it out on his bride in this day she'll rise up in an age that is so full of darkness so full of wickedness so full of doubt and as we expressed earlier satan can hide it so well we don't even realize it's fear we think it's something else but the holy ghost come and says i'll shine my light on it i'll set my people free hallelujah god bless you saints we'll see you wednesday night amen just take the word deep down in the heart take it home with you amen and just then whatever you have to do to not forget it amen reminds me there's a sister in arizona i won't mention names but she she told me she says oh brother paul [Music] she said you know i have all these things i thought oh my goodness she's going to tell me about every ailment and problem in her life and i had to admit at the moment i was like oh lord please and she says you know i have all these issues in my life and she just bounced over the couple top of them she had heart issues she had female issues and she says you know what i do then got my interest because she wasn't just talking planet of like uh-huh you know what i do she goes you know what i do i go home from church every sunday and wednesday and i have these pages about this big and i sit down with a big bold marker and i write these things from the word of god from the prophet or even what the minister says and i go around my house before i go to bed and i pin them on the wall and then when i get up morning i can't hardly think because my mind is cloudy my back my hips it's that in the other and i feel a little dejected i just walk around my house and i get to relive the word of god all over again and she said in a few minutes the curtains are open and i'm singing i think some of us probably ought to do that hallelujah if you need any help affording the paper and the markers i can do that i don't know what to say about your walls after you thumb tacked them to death but if that's what it takes to find victory amen just repeat the word of what god said about you not what the devil said oh i could preach to you again god bless you we love you so much amen take the word of god press to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus we love you god bless you [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music]
