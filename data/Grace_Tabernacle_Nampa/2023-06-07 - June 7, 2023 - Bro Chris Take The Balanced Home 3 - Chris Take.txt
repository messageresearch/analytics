at camp next week so amen praise the Lord you want to turn with me um do Proverbs chapter 31. we will start in verse one the words of King Lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth Kings it is not for Kings oh that meal it is not for Kings to drink wine or for Prince's strong drink lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the Judgment of any of The Afflicted now verse 10 who can find a virtuous woman for her prices far above rubies the heart of her husband death safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship ships she bringeth her food from afar verse 17 she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she proceeded perceive it that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff verse 28 her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he prayseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou ex tell us them all hey man you let's have a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you Father to be in your house again tonight Lord we just pray that you

you and Lord that is your desire so father we just Commit This service into your hands tonight may you speak to us we just want to remember our pastor Lord with the farm and the different things Lord this prayer to encourage him Lord Heal his eyes Lord and father just help him to feel better and encourage his Spirit we ask we love you Lord we commit this service into your hands and ask you again that you would speak to our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated tonight so I would like to continue um sorry for the I try to keep my voice the same when I start but I always start off too quiet and then they have to mess with the sound so my apologies but uh we want to continue tonight on the um the series that we've been going through and we're on part three of the balanced home so we read in Proverbs 31 and I and I wanted to read proverbs 31 I'm not going to minister so much on on Proverbs 31 but there was a couple of things that I just wanted to again reinforce um our our position now now our position is strength so anytime that we find our position in Christ that's where we find our strength and and the you know Joshua positionally placed Israel in the land and uh brother says Ephesians parallels Joshua so Ephesians places us in our position and we read you know we know Ephesians 5 and how it lays out the family and the order and different things and so as Believers our desire then should be the the top of the of the list should be what is our position and and we we can say uh you know what is God's will for our life we can say what is what is the job I'm going to take all of these things and they all fall underneath the umbrella of our position and where where do God where does God want us to go to church and and what does God say in his word where we should be and so there's a bit of a Baseline there's a bit of a baseline on um where where we start from so anytime you have anything that you desire to do you know the best place to start is okay is it is it is it God's is it in God's word now we know if you're going to move somewhere the first thing you check is is there a church that preaches the word of God that's a baseline that should be a desire and so there's different things where we start with right and there's a baseline on our positions and you know a man is a man and a woman is a woman and that kind of thing and and so we start there and God designed that that that sex should be in marriage not outside of marriage so there's all of these things these baselines that that are in the scripture that we build our life from and then each and every detail in that well that's comes to you and that is from God but it can't deviate from the word of God so just to highlight a couple of the scriptures here I really liked this um verse here it just kind of popped out to me it says what my son what the son of my you know proverbs 31 is known as the the the Proverbs or the chapter for women but it starts off with the instruction it's actually it's 20 to to her son the prophecy of his mother lemuel's mother is telling him this so so he knows what to look for in a woman and and so she says my son you know he she says give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth Kings and so I went and I and I got the Amplified um version I don't know if everyone knows about the Amplified Bible it just kind of takes it and uh in square brackets and different things it'll it'll put in um the more of a deeper look into the meanings of the words and different things so in the Amplified version it says give them not your strength to loose women nor your ways to those who who and that which ruin and Destroy Kings so in other words don't you have a strength God's given you a strength as a man and and don't just don't give that out that's for your why okay we can start there with virtue and living virtuous and moral but at the same time you're called to your position and what what this what I take from this um scripture is and you can look up in Strong's Concordance as well strengthen strength and you can find the different places it was used in the same occurrences that strong strongs has that option that and it's same thing as Mighty Men of Valor and all these things so so it really what she's telling him is first of all be moral and that is your position that's a very basic thing as a man be moral and but to build on top of that strength is your position so he's he's telling her she's telling him son your strength is your position don't just don't give it away don't do go into things that were destroyed Kings and kingdoms and so I wanted to also pull in here uh in verse 17 says she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms and I wanted to pull the Amplified of this one as well so she girds herself with strength spiritual mental and physical fitness for her god-given task and makes her arms strong and firm in other words there's nothing lazy about this woman there is nothing there is no couch potato in her if you will and and I and I just want to notate on this um well let's go to the next one so physical fitness for god-given tax I thought that was very interesting how they put that in there and it makes sense you know if you're if you're healthy and you're and and you're taking care of yourself you're going to give you you're going to put more into your god-given task you know God has called us and I'll just put this here now because the next scripture will fall right in line with that many of you know that I'm I'm I I enjoy Fitness and um I have I I stay my my let me put this in my goal is not to to have you know the the beach bot or have the I'm not that we go to the beach but have the you know Mr Olympia that's not my goal that's that kind of goal is Vanity and it won't get you very far my goal is is as I just said we were gone for a week and it was long hours of travel it was late nights it was preaching it was all these things and and if I keep myself healthy and in the fitness I could give my god-given task to the best of my ability but if I'm not taking care of myself that then what am I giving to God because God has called this whole thing to his service and um same thing for for not just for the men so now the the young men we're all younger than somebody so everyone hears young men in a similar way urge so this is the Amplified version of Titus 2 verse six to eight you can go and read the the regular version if you want to but it says in a similar way urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently and this really goes uh in tonight to what we're going to to talk about I just wanted to kind of lay a foundation again and bring our our Focus back to this because it's been a couple of weeks but um having behaved prudently taking life seriously um in in the in the world that we live in today everything's a joke and and if we're not careful we we let that joking around which is nothing wrong with that but if we're not careful we let that cross over and now we don't take life seriously you know you don't wear your suit to church young guys you should all have a suit now this is a personal opinion okay my wife was very reminded me that hey don't you know watch your personal opinion she's right I appreciate that but that's my personal opinion we're the best of church okay so taking life seriously so you go to a job interview you're going to dress your best you're going to put your effort into your resume and you're going to be respectful to society and the people around you into the community the community that you're in so taking life seriously and says and show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and words teaching what is unadulterated showing gravity having the strictest regard now this is what I really like having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive now I don't want the young people here tonight remember when we took we took a youth meeting on but is it honorable and there's certain things that might be okay it might not be against the word of God but sometimes you have to look deeper and say yes but is it an honorable thing to do there are certain things that are not honorable and if you live life save your life seriously and you have desire to be you know should disregard for truth and purity of motive what is your motive and objective okay so with dignity and seriousness seriousness again nothing wrong with with taking life serious I think it's important and I think in the society like I said today we do we do have enough reverence and let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome so when you give somebody instruction don't just give it on a whim it make sure it's sound and fit and wise and wholesome now tell me is there anything outside of the word of God that doesn't fit this the best the word of God fits this description the best so whatever doctrines you have whatever ideas you have whatever uh views you have politically whether it be whatever it would be make sure it's lots of with the word of God and its sound fit wise and wholesome because you don't ever we you underestimate especially as a man you underestimate the uh influence you have on somebody who looks up to you they might not be younger than you they might be your period but they look up to you you underestimate the ability you have and what they do and what they take with what you've said so make sure you take it serious so your instruction be sound fit wise wholesome vigorous irrefutable and above sensor so that the opponent may not put maybe put to shame finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us us not you us as a whole how are you conducting yourself outside of the walls inside of your family outside of the church amen so all of that being said and that that positions kind of laid out there again I would like to take tonight and talk and the balanced home about home economics now this is a very large subject so maybe if Lord Wills will take a few services on it but I want to start and and to look at this and we've kind of talked about the man and husband and the mother and the wife and all those things and and uh we haven't got to the the kids yet we're coming for you um but I was feeling LED you know just really thinking lately about about stewardship and and how that that um economics is not just money it's it's the whole ecosystem of the home outside of certain things you know it's how you you know did you paint the wall that needs to be painted did you fix the patch you know stuff like that not always you know we joke of the honey to do this but really it's not it's it's taking care of what God's God has blessed you with so I was thinking about this and and and being good stewards and I thought what we are we are ambassadors of God so let me put it this way very simply for you if you're an ambassador for the United States and you are over in China or um Japan or you know the Middle East wherever you are if you do something that brings shame on America if you do something that comes against the laws you are not if you just act any way you won't be an ambassador but as an ambassador you want you understand that in this country I am viewed as the United States so in this world that we live in today you are viewed as Christ so you want people to be attracted to God you want to be honey salty right you want to make them thirsty so you have to be an ambassador for God now there's a fine line on this but if you're taking care of your family and your home God says he'll take care of us now does God want us to look like well I'm not going to go there so we want to have good economics so all that being said Luke chapter 12 verse 13. now I will tell you this um I don't know at all surprise um you know last time I spoke I mentioned something about you know well if you're a girl and you're you know you're 25 and you can look for a career and I'm sorry I didn't mean to put an age to it so I thank you for your patience and for taking this journey with me because I'm learning it right alongside of you and so my desire is to stick with the word that way you don't get brother Chris you get Christ okay so if you have this if you find a discrepancy in the word and you want to bring the word and you want to talk please that would be great Luke 12 chapter verse 13. um you know there's been many times where where in in this series that we've been ministering on there's been many times where you know at home like okay you know I'm preaching this I want this to be in my home and I've gone and I've sat down and just flipped Through the Bible Lord give me something to help me right now and so that's my desire and in Luke chapter 12 verse 13 Jesus is speaking to to a group of people and um and then an innumerable multitude the Bible says so you couldn't count them and he's preaching to them and he comes to this part in his sermon and he says in verse 13 and and um one of these somebody speaks up from the from the audience and says Master speak excuse me speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me you know it's like it's like that questions and answers where somebody asks a question that they know the answer to but they're trying to get somebody else and he said unto him man who made a judge who made me a judge or a divider over you I like to think he said it like man and he said to them take heed and beware of covetousness so okay so here's the thing that I really like about the word of God God doesn't always tell us see this this this person asked him said Master speak to my brother he divide inheritance in other words tell him how to split our inheritance and he says I'm not going to do that but I'm going to tell you what you need to know to split the inheritance yourself the best thing that I can do when I Mentor somebody in the in the secular in my in the business world the best thing that I can do is I can teach them how to do it themselves instead of telling them every little detail because there's a lot of details in what I do for a living tell them every detail I teach them the concept then they take the concept and they go and apply it to their daily tasks so God teaches us the concept there are certain things that we just know that's not right because God has taught us the concept see well there's no scripture for this over here there's no scripture for this over here it says well yeah but what's the content in other words what's the heart of God that's what he gives to us he gives us a new spirit he gives us himself so that we understand the concept and we apply those to the nuances and the details of our daily life so he's this is what he says he doesn't tell him how to do it but he says here's some advice take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesses now be careful right this is uh I wish I could just jump really quickly to the first screen this is the balanced home so everything's balanced okay now some people can take this so far um and they're just living um with poor economics they went too far everything in balance and he speak a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully so he gives his text his subject and then he gives an example and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will I do I will pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my soul soul thou Hast much good laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry pretty much retirement okay but God said unto him thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of Thee then whose shall those things be which thou Hast provided so in plain Modern English you fool you're gonna die tonight and all that you worked for now who's it does it belong to because it's not going to do you any good so if we're not careful we run with that and we say well yep you can't be rich can't have money you know in a second so is he that layeth up Treasures for himself verse 21 and is not rich toward God the Bible doesn't say money is evil the Bible says the love of money is evil when the Bible says you can't serve two masters you have to serve either God or Mammon when you're serving Mammon in other words all you care about is the next dollar we should all be motivated to make money for our households guess what that's how the world Works Cold Hard Cash well cold hard plastic sometimes that's how the world runs that is economics so we want to run our home as good stewards and so I we can't read the whole chapter so I pulled a few verses from this and just a touch back again on this one we just read and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possessive so a couple of things first point don't be jealous of some other somebody else's blessing second thing life is not about what you own so we've all been there where we just knew we were going to have that new thing and it was going to be the best thing and then we got it and then some time went on and now we could live without it so it's also how much stuff you can get second third point don't put all your focus into building your bigger Barns and neglect your soul don't put all your focus into providing money for your family and neglect your family everything in balance fourth point if you lay up Treasures for yourself you find yourself lacking in Treasures of God so if you spend all your time putting Treasures to yourself you're not rich toward God so now in verse 21 is the point here pull out here where to read this one life is more this is verse 23. now I just there's something about when you pull a verse by itself it you zoom in or you as I like to say we double click life is more than meat and the body is more than Raymond in other words you know what you got to have that that that that you know 75 dollar skirt from Sarah Williams Boutique you've got to have those uh weatherproof hunting boots waterproof crispy crispy boots that's a famous hunting brand popular hunting brand like 350 bucks gotta have them and then you get them and then if you if you had the option to die or give up the boots you'd give up the boots when you're when you're fighting for your life and you know there's a well anyways you understand the point the body is more than Raymond and life is more than meat so oh we gotta you know we we've done this just be transparent we gotta have this food so we buy it and we go home and it goes bad in the fridge life is more than meat but guess what you can't have any of this stuff and live you have to have it still right so it doesn't say hey don't eat hey don't wear clothes please wear clothes he says for all these things do the nations of the world seek after so everyone's that's everyone's Focus that's everyone's Focus okay but you got to have them got to have clothes and I think nice calls are good they last longer for one thing and your father knoweth that you have need of these things so he's not saying it's wrong to have them he's saying it's wrong to focus on them everything in Balance home economics you know it's it's a terrible example but you've seen it that family that has let's say a Jeep Wagoneer out front and their house is I don't want to offend anybody but you understand what I'm saying their houses not good something's out of balance here right the car should be equivalent to the value of the home how about that you have a really really really nice house and it well okay never mind you understand the point that the things are out of balance so the Lord knows you have need of these things so he provides for them so he backs this up with now I know I'm probably going to make mistakes but you just bear with me and God will take care of it because that's my heart but brother seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you so you see it's your focus this goes back to what a young man should focus on as he's growing up he should focus on on on you know having his schooling taken care of you know it's in the world we live in today it's good to have your high school diploma so you know you focus on that get out of that now college is optional as far as I'm concerned but um the world we live in is is a certain way in different careers what are you going to do for a living where are you going to live what's God's will for your life all of those things that's kind of your focus because you're building an economy to support a family and a girl she's growing up and her focus should be on how she's going to support the economy her future husband will provide for her that's your focus okay that's what God wants he wants you to be focused on the proper thing and when you're focused on the right thing you're in the right position they were in the right position because God looks God looks at the desires of your heart so he knows hey this is what you desire for and you always pray Lord what's your will for my life because if we're not careful we we preach it a certain way and we cut people off that God is leading on a very specific path so he says seek the kingdom of God first put God first number one rule put God first I've heard it said read your Bible before you even brush your teeth I think that's a little much so don't be legalistic about it you're putting God first putting God first is addressing him at the beginning of your day whatever the beginning of your day looks like okay you're addressing him you're seeking him and then in everything that you do you say hey well you know um I'm gonna do this over here how am I going to put God first when something comes up a choice you know you got you got a couple of things you need to do I'm being very vague so please fill in the blanks for me two choices of what you go you want to do well which one hinges on this scripture putting God first start there and then if both of them do well okay but you start there that's the Baseline keep God first in your life and all these things let me ask you a question is there anything left out of the word all all these things shall be added unto you I really like this scripture this is in Luke chapter 12 as well you know go home and read Luke chapter 12 write it down go read it it's like 59 verses long so there's a lot in there and it all kind of fits I just couldn't take the time to read the entire script chapter but I really like this one so when it comes to to this subject of the balanced home and and keeping things lined up with the word of God and having beautiful Harmony in your home and having good economics in other words being smart with your finances being smart with with your home taking care of your home you know if you've got a leak in the basement fix the leak in the basement don't leave it there which is going to make problems worse be a good Steward with your time I've been wrestling my irrigation for like two weeks and traveling everything in between and but I'm I'm staying the course because it's my I'm being a good Steward of what's God you say brother Chris it's grass if you have a God gave me that grass so if I can't be a good Steward of that how am I being you understand like someone pulls up to your house and it's just all junky and then you say you're a Christian what are they going to associate Christianity with with that now you don't have to be rich to have a nice home there's a quote that I have where it says you know keep your home nice have I read that here yet let me see if I can just grab it really quickly brother Branham what achievement should we let our pre-teenage children participate in this is a question given to him and questions and answers 1964. he says I beg your pardon what activity should our pre-teen children anticipate or participate in also how should we go about helping them select their Associates he says keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can if it's a girl keeper with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with a boy see that she keeps with the right kind of a boy discourage her to any boy otherwise or boy to a girl if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa now he says make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother in other words clean and orderly nice as well as a nice atmosphere a nice atmosphere not one of contention and all of those things and into their house make homes so happy this is his words make home so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there so there's a lot packed into those sentences in this paragraph but the gist of it is make your home nice keep it clean keep it orderly you know you got too much junk get rid of that junk if it's hindering the keeping the home nice and everything right because if you have a dirt floor you still sweep that every day I don't think any of us have dirt floors you can keep doesn't being having a nice home doesn't mean you have to be rich okay I think we made the point y'all look at me like move on so all of these things are we're an ambassador for Christ and in Luke 12 35 says let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and your lights burning that's that's a good one there now later on in this chapter as I hope you'll read in your devotions at home he tells another story and because Peter asks him and Peter says you know you're giving all these Parables unto us and um in other words can you explain this and he tells a story of a faithful and a wise Steward and all of these things and and um he says this is this in his in his exhortation to his disciples he says blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so do it in other words the master says all right I entrust you with the estate take care of this and he goes off right and when he comes back he finds the steward doing not sitting doing now when I say sitting and talking about theoretically and because you're all sitting in church but that's the best place you can be right now okay so not sitting but but but you're you're not doing nothing you're doing that's how God wants to find you you know people well anyways we've we've heard that you know well the you know Rapture is coming and and uh and that that happened years ago hopefully it's not still happening hopefully everyone learned their lesson but um you know you know the Lord's coming all this stuff so you know why you know we're not going to buy houses we're not going to have jobs we're not going to take care of careers we're going to live day to day and then now they're old and they have no retirement and things aren't going well because God says do do we I don't have we we we as Christians is it type A personality sweetheart where you work do stuff all the time never sit down is that type A okay whatever whatever one of those things people say oh well they're type A you know I'm just overachievers you see what the devil does is he pulls stuff in school like oh well they're overachievers and it's cool to be the lazy dude on the back row been there we had to sit with our slouched and then we were cool I did it I was there but that's and then I had to grow up and then I had to learn that you're not gonna get anywhere spiritually or in life if you just chill all the time now we want to be chilly I want to be even tempered but we don't want to be lazy we want to be doing there's always something to be doing always something to be doing and I know I'm probably like a little bit overboard on the doing part but that's okay I'll pull you from the other side and we'll balance each other out so I I've mentioned this before this is but brother this is Theodore Roosevelt and he he said this in a speech he gave he says I wish to preach the doctrine not the doctrine of ignorable ease but the doctrine of the strenuous life and you can read stories about him and he really liked this model but what it is is we we leave this model we leave this to the world and then we look at them and say oh they're all they're all worried about the money and everything and and and we say well we're Christians and God will take care of us so we sit and do nothing God will let you sit in your nothingness and rot until you get up and start doing something there's simple Baseline and so I love this and I and I Try by God's grace to live by the motto to live a strenuous life it's not easy right his his he says in the scripture my yoke is easy and my burden is light so serving God is a joy it's not a burden it's a joy and if you are at the fitness level of running 50 miles 50 miles is a light and easy burden so what God does is he gives you the spiritual Fitness you hear him again I'm Fitness I am sorry spiritual Fitness to be able to look at 50 miles and say yep when do you want me to go Lord but the world looks on or or or a Christian who's not in their position looks on and says oh that's impossible exactly it it wasn't impossible it wouldn't be up to God that's why the scripture is there With God all things are possible we cannot serve god without God so it is impossible to be a Christian on your own but with Christ it's not I know that's very simple but God calls us to a strenuous life I mean go and read the stories of the men in the Bible and what they went through none of them they were all doing okay but he that this is in the same chapter verse 48. so Less on the stripes more on the second part of the verse for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more now I'm really learning this firsthand at work right now different things but I'm being thrust into more responsibilities and for a while I was didn't want it because more responsibilities more is asked of you and I remember there was a time in my life as a husband and a father where I had to come face to face with the fact that I wasn't doing enough I was being lazy I don't understand grown men who can game I don't have enough time to gain there's too much to be doing if I'm not working on a project if I'm not working if I'm not preparing a sermon if I'm not you know doing something for the Youth or for different things in the church or or traveling for the ministry or whatever then I'm spending time with my family and we said oh we're so busy I challenge you if you have the ability to do so you say you're too busy to do all the things you need to do today I challenge you turn your phone off and leave it in your bedroom you will be amazed how much time you waste just picking it up and looking at it because we just pick it up and look at it 10 minutes well you do that six times a day that's a whole hour do you know what you can do with the whole hour so I realized I had to get the games on my phone this was years ago delete them it was time to get doing and I started to to embrace that yes it's hard but but that's what makes it all the better with Vigor young men should have Vigor and vitality and be energized I mean you see me energized but you know and that's not to say you have to show the energy but have the endurance have the energy to to go to go through with it to stay awake in church sorry I couldn't resist the energy to put into because guess what that's that when you're in your youth when we're in our youth that's the energy then when we get older we can sit on the porch in the rocking chair and counsel the young men right if the Lord should Terry but you don't ever just because you have gray hairs doesn't mean you have experience so you got to get that experience while you have the energy to do so that was personal opinion so we want to be faithful ambassadors now you don't have to run around like a chicken with your head cut off when I say energized I I don't want to get too off on that but uh take Life by the horns okay do you want to be faithful ambassadors well what is that scripture we all we all want to hear one day well done my good and faithful servant so you can do this in your own studies you know it's always nice to have a kind of a fresh idea what to do in devotions go through the scriptures and look the word look for the verses look for the stories that describe a faithful servant you be that and when you get to that place in glory one day he will tell you well done my good and faithful servant if it is not going to require anything out of you that he didn't write down we want to be faithful ambassadors now in Luke chapter 16 Luke verse 10 he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much now I speak from experience how many times do we say if I just had more money I'd be able to pay my bills this is the very challenging subject and we're we are still learning and we are still living this but if you're serving God if you're paying your tithes if you're paying offerings if you're if you're putting God first in your life you're being responsible with what he's given you he's going to take care of it whether you have money in the bank or not God never told us to fear always have faith okay we're not to be Beggars we don't beg God takes care of us and we're his child what do you want to what do you want to give your child when he's when they're listening and they're obeying and and they're serving you they're doing their best you want to give them the nicest thing yeah the best thing for their for their needs and everything so he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much God says all right I'll give you a little bit and let me see how you handle that for years we struggled financially this is just personal testimony this is not lifting myself up for years we struggle financially as soon as I begin to be a good Steward of the money that God was giving us the money started to come in I got a better job and I got promoted then they got promoted again then they got another job that was better than that and every time just before God gave us an increase he tried us hard on if we would stick with the principles he had given us for finances and when we did out the other side would come and increase now it's not going to be it never doesn't necessarily like that for us it wasn't just up a nice little set of staircases there was some you know what do they call that you're looking at a a graph and you want to see growth you know if you zoom way out it's just it's like a straight line but if you zoom in it's like this right but it's always up okay that's how it is so God tries you to see are you going to be faithful he said oh God you know I remember one time I was like okay I'm gonna tell my landlord I'm gonna testify to her because I heard the testimony God's gonna give me a thousand dollars by the end of the day and I didn't win and I goofed off all day long so guess what it came at the end of the day and I look like an absolute fool is that the kind of representation we want to give the world of what Christ is I should have went out and tried my best first of all I shouldn't have been there I should have had rent when rent was due if you're late on rent you're late there needs to be a good reason how about that they don't just be late all the time it's if it's habitual you're doing something wrong and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much now this is a little bit negative but I want you to look at the positive side of this if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches they say oh I I want to be I want to be used of God and I want to be a part of the church and doing stuff and and you can't take care of your home and the economics of your home God's not going to trust you with the riches of the church and I don't mean cash I mean helping the body God can I had the desire to go out and do what what we just did last this over this last week and what God has called us to over the uh called us to do now in the ministry I had desires for that years ago but I didn't have anything in place I had no experience I had I didn't my I wasn't taking care of my family wasn't taking care of my home so God said nope it wasn't until I got all of that sorted out that that desire I had in my heart that pull I felt began to manifest out here he says look I want to make sure so you're looking you're wondering why aren't things working out you know we had a recent incident I'll be very transparent we had a recent incident where it was just like you ever been there where it's like where's the money it's just gone and then sometimes it's like wow the money's just there there's not any more but it's just it's going more places and I just Lord what's going on what's going on and I realized and I'll have the scripture later on that there was a time where tithes were owed and I didn't pay an additional half so one and a half times as soon as I fixed it that that day he provided us provided for us that day it was in almost instant now I'm not saying every time it's going to be innocent but it was God showing me yes look you honor me you put me first you pay your tithes like you're supposed to even when it hurts I will take care of you because he owns a how did we do that it's the flesh I know but how do we do that we forget that God owns everything he's got all of this we should never have to beg God owns everything we just gotta do what he says and he'll bless us and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own now he doesn't say he doesn't specify house car money he just says another man so if you're renting you better take care of that house that apartment you're you're leasing a vehicle renting a vehicle whatever it would be you take care of that you go you go to another state you rent a car that car better show up cleaner than it was before you say well you're just being a clean freak no that's being an ambassador for Christ people say wow yeah you go to a restaurant you tip because that's being an ambassador for Christ look there's a perfect story brother Madam the waitress was rude to him didn't deserve a tip and he tipped her a little extra and he had insight into what was going on that doesn't matter we our ambassadors are everywhere we go in public we get our drink they you know Starbucks and you ordered a Vente quad shot soy milk two pumps of sugar free vanilla one pump of caramel with whip on top and cinnamon dolce sprinkles and they give you no whip no cinnamon dolce sprinkles you don't go up there and be like I want to talk to your manager and you don't be rude you say hey do you mind can you fix this for me if your whipped cream is that important to you and you're nice they can be as rude as they want you don't you're not judged for that you're judged for how you represent Christ I'm probably gonna have to deal with this on Friday God have you speak something so direct like that every time I almost a couple days later it's like oh oh he he say humble before God I don't I'm not up here I'm pointing one finger but I got four pointing back three point see I can't count three point back at me the foolishness of preaching that's what the Bible says that doesn't give me a ride as a minister to be foolish but in God's eyes preaching is what he ordained us to anyways but we're just men who make mistakes so be faithful in what God has given you and then so you're faithful to other man he shall give you what's your own and you'll be faithful with that you know keep your car clean take good care of it take good care of your stuff you know God calls us to a higher order and I know of a story where someone borrowed a piece of Machinery from somebody else and it wasn't their fault but it broke while they had it and it was just I was already coming apart but you know what that person knew this was given to me in good faith that it will return to them the same and in good working order because it was given to that person in working order so they went and they bought a brand new one and replaced it you say wow that's way overboard yeah but is God not gonna stand behind that you see we oh we gotta we gotta hold on to it we gotta hold on to it but when have you when if you can't give now you got to have everything taken care of pay your tithes God pay your bills because that's being a good ambassador okay you could have a quarter tank and need a half a tank and God tells you to give somebody the twenty dollars you need to make your take have more gas guess what you do that turn around God fills up the whole thing now don't go out doing it expecting the whole thing but you do it because you know hey you know what God has under control or you don't have to drive there anymore right I mean you never know what how God's going to do but but how what what a place would that be if we had such total faith in God like that that he would take care of everything what kind of people would he be I think we'd be a lot more giving and eternal life by definition eternal life is living for other people and that's not just leave it to JFK to say don't look what you what your country can do for you look what you can do for your country let's not leave that phrase for them because I think that lines up with the word of God don't ask what God can do for you ask what you could arrest what the kingdom of God can do for you ask what you can do for the kingdom of God living for other people the governor says pray for other people's needs and watch God meet your own see it's a it's a it's a it's a mind shift okay a few more here to get through so tithing say great preachers after our pocketbook again well no it's in the scripture and all the tithe of the land whether there whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's it is Holy unto the Lord and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall add there to the fifth part thereof in other words if you have to redeem in other words you owe Tides you add a fifth part to that and ties is is by definition in other places ten percent of of your increase now I'm just going to interject something there maybe it's on my opinion maybe not but when you get your check and it says gross and it says net in between gross and net that stuff is paying for your stuff it's paying your taxes it's paying your benefits it's paying your uh Social Security it's all of yours your stuff so they're just paying it for you so tithe on the gross that's my personal opinion but that's your increase all those things even between gross and net they are paying for your stuff they're just doing it for you if you had a 1099 instead of you have W4 or whatever it is W-2 get it to 99. you would pay what you were paying you would pay tithes on it but then as soon as we go maybe that's like you guys that was me for a while and then one day I was like hang on a second okay so my personal opinion pay on the gross now um in Hebrews chapter 7 part 1 1957. he says what would a man take tithings for if he never was born never he's talking about Melchizedek Melchizedek comes to Abraham and Abraham Pays His ties to Melchizedek and he's saying why does Melchizedek need the money he doesn't need the money No Maybe get that dog out the out of the church sorry folks um so never had a father so why does why does you need to pay tithing to Melchizedek when Melchizedek is is he's all-knowing he's Eternal he's right he's everything well he says so that's what he's talking about right here so he says that never will die and also the beginning to end and he never had no father or mother or descent and owned the whole heavens and earth and all in it why would he take tithe why would he ask Abraham to pay tithes you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes so even though he's Melchizedek Abraham paid him tithes and it's in the scripture and it says that while the the Levi was in the loins of Abraham he paid tithes because it's God's money it's actually not your money that portion there is not your money it's God's money you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes tithing is right every Christian is Duty bound to pay tithe that's right never has been changed you pay your tithes he says um but you know I feel like this that a member of a church their first obligation is with their tithe and offerings is to support their Church if you are members of These Fine churches as represented here you support your church that's your first duty to God bring your tithe and offerings into the storehouse the offerings too and the storehouse you surely know what that is what that is it's where you get your food so there is where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to your church and not to an evangelist like me so he's saying that's your duty bound and that's your first duty to God to pay your tithes to God now here's what he says right here he says tithes pays the preacher the pastor he's he's to live by the tithe of the people but we have to get something else to do we have to have our part into it they can't make it it up there's another Society will do another Society so he's saying that they can't pay the preacher because they're not paying their tithes so they have soup suppers and they have the different kind of things like that and baking sales and everything to support the pastor instead of paying their ties like God had it to be God's way is right isn't that the truth it's not the truth if we could just we could always come back to that and say what's God's way always come back to that God's way is Right tithe and offerings goes to Levi which was the minister if everybody would pay their tithes you wouldn't have to have any soup supper see you adopted something else and leave the tide things off say it's an Old Testament argument I'd like for you to prove it to me that's right you can't do it by God's word it's a new testament order too God makes one order it can never be changed it has to remain that way so in the home economics we want to start with putting God first and we want to start with with paying our tithes because that's what it is that 10 that goes into the the the the your tithes go to the church and that pays the pastor and that's for him to take care of okay it's your offerings and everything else outside of that that help with the building and the building funds and things like that now um so in all this talk about money and different things and this is um maybe a bit of a personal opinion but um you ought to have a budget now this is a little bit silly but if you don't know where your money's going if you don't tell your money where to go your money disappears so when you got down with your to the end of your budget you should have nothing left over because if you have a left over it'll go to Starbucks or Dutch Bros it'll just fall through your hands like sand okay so so I think I put this in here since I think budget is important and it's part of the home economics you need to know what's going on you know there's no excuse to not know right you know adulting is hard stop you now prescribe to the strenuous Life as a Christian adulting is not hard adulting is strenuous and God is there to inspire you and give you the strength you need to continue living life as a good ambassador of Christ now all of these things I know for me the first time I heard it was very overwhelming and and every day you know we're faced again with our mistakes we're faced again with our discrepancies we're faced again with our failures and we say wow I did it again I bought Starbucks and I forgot to pay a bill now I don't have the money because it's been done on Starbucks or whatever apparently as you guys know now Starbucks is our problem because a preacher preaches where he lives so so here's the deal I don't know your life I don't know the nuances and the details and frankly I don't want to know you have the different things between you and God and your family that's okay you want to tell me that's fine too I don't want to sound like rude or things I do care very deeply about each one of you God says be strong and of good courage You're Not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with her so ever thou goeth so he's saying not just fear but don't be dismayed don't be depressed don't be downtrodden because you're looking at this and you're thinking man I need to do better but it's so hard some days you're tired and no matter how much caffeine you drink you can't shake it and you have things you have to do but you're tired some days we put them off and then we regret it you know what it I hated the saying as a kid but it stuck with me my entire life and my dad got it from his dad so my grandpa is where it started maybe from his dad but it's don't put off tomorrow what you can do today and that comes back sometimes when it's 9 p.m and it's raining I said well I can still do it today it's it's hard but so is Jericho and look what happened when Joshua said all right we're going across the river Jordan we're going to face a mountain we don't have the money for so God said March around seven times so here we are you see God was telling him what to do but then God came and said be strong and of good courage I'm with you I'm asking you to do this so I'll be with you he's asking you to be a better Ambassador for Christ in the in your home and have a balanced home that represents Christ of the world he's not going to leave you hanging by yourself he's going to come and he's going to be strong and of good courage not to hinge on this word courage and one last thing at the men as we close Charles Spurgeon said a man without courage is a knife without an edge everybody hates that knife that won't cut anything courage is not ignoring this is another one another saying I remember who said if a courage is not ignoring the danger and acting like it's not there courage is facing the danger and doing what needs to be done that paraphrase that's a paraphrase God calls us the stuff now getting up in the morning making that breakfast to the family and cleaning the house and keeping a nice home or or getting up in the morning and and and you know getting that cup of coffee and stumbling to work and now you have to stumble to work but going to work or you know up late because you got to work on this project to take care of the family and keep things going and running smoothly takes courage you don't have to be facing a AK-47 someone telling you deny Christ or I'll shoot you it takes courage just to do those everyday things and God says I will give you the courage to do so and I want to be a man with courage because I don't want to be a dull Knight Spurgeon goes on to Define this phrase and he says a man with a sharp knife can cut his way through to success It's a Jungle it's a jungle and the best way to get through the jungle is the Bowie knife now you don't face your your colleague at work and say I'm going to cut you down because I'm going to be the leader no that's not what I mean when an obstacle comes up you take the best sword I know of the word of God and if you are Mount of Courage you will take the word of God and apply it to your life only a week man will say it's too hard to live let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord you call us to uh such a high order and I believe tonight Lord we're ready to step up to the challenge but we can't do it without you that's the beautiful thing of this of this calling that you've given us Lord we can in no way shape or form ever do it until we find you and you surrender to you and then you do it through us but we surrender to you we have things we have to do we have our part to play and we surrender everything else we servant it all to you and you guide us and you lead us and you give us the strength that we need to be courageous like Joshua to be strong to face life even when it's difficult we face it and we say God I need your strength and you call that courage you call that a strong man you call that a strong woman when we say God I can't do it without you you're not a crutch you are our life and there's no living without life thank you Lord we love you we appreciate you may you just be with us and lead us and guide us we ask in all these things we once again remember our pastors God may just be the strength to him Lord and encouragement to end father [Music] thank you for his efforts Lord Jesus keeping up on the farm in the busy season taking care of the church is not an easy place to be and you just keep continue to
