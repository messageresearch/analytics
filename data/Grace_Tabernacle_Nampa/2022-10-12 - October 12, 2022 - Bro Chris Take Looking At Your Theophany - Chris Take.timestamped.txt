[29:11] number 903
[29:15] came to me
[29:17] amen
[29:19] the gulf that
[29:23] separated me from Christ my Lord
[29:31] it was so vast The Crossing eye could
[29:39] never fall
[29:43] from where I was to his demands it
[29:51] seemed so far
[29:55] I cry dear Lord I cannot come to where
[30:03] you are
[30:05] [Music]
[30:08] he came to me aren't you glad
[30:13] he came to me
[30:18] when I could not come to where he was he
[30:26] came to
[30:28] me
[30:30] and that's why he died
[30:36] on
[30:37] Calvary
[30:41] when I could not come to
[30:45] where he was he came to me
[30:53] he came to me when I was bound in Chains
[31:01] of my sins
[31:04] he came to me when I possessed no hope
[31:12] within
[31:16] they picked me up and Drew Me Gently
[31:22] to his side
[31:27] where today in his sweet love I now
[31:34] above
[31:37] God
[31:39] he came to me
[31:46] [Applause]
[31:49] when I could not come to where he was he
[31:56] came to me
[32:01] and that's why he died
[32:04] [Music]
[32:11] when I could not come to where he was he
[32:18] came to me
[32:22] he came to me
[32:27] he came to me
[32:32] when I could not come to where he was he
[32:39] came to me
[32:43] and that's why he died
[32:47] [Music]
[32:53] when I could not come to where he was
[32:59] he came to
[33:05] amen good to be in your in the presence
[33:08] of the Lord tonight to be in the house
[33:10] of God we're going to take the Liberty
[33:13] to bring greetings from Brother Stephen
[33:14] Coffey and his assembly there
[33:16] tonight from them didn't tell me exactly
[33:20] but
[33:21] um
[33:22] we uh I'm going to bring that to you so
[33:26] amen if you have your Bibles you want to
[33:29] stand tonight we will
[33:31] get into the word this evening
[33:37] sing that song he came to me
[33:40] but around says that he came down and
[33:42] became us so that we could become him
[33:46] you see sometimes we think
[33:49] I don't say this in an arrogant Spirit
[33:51] but we think to live a little of Who We
[33:55] Are
[33:57] the devil wants to put you down and make
[33:59] you feel small and insignificant which
[34:03] you are
[34:04] in the right
[34:06] attitude
[34:07] when you see God and who he is and how
[34:09] he is desired desire to express himself
[34:12] in you
[34:14] you feel you are humble but you are
[34:16] confident
[34:17] and the power that he has given you as
[34:20] Sons and Daughters of God Amen Psalms
[34:23] chapter 116.
[34:28] looks like you already saw my
[34:30] um title tonight
[34:34] but um it's looking at your theophany
[34:39] Psalms 116 verse
[34:42] 9
[34:47] Psalms 116 verse 9.
[34:53] I will walk before the Lord in the land
[34:57] of the living
[34:59] I believed therefore have I spoken
[35:02] I was greatly afflicted
[35:04] Paul takes the Liberty to cut that
[35:06] scripture in half and he says I believed
[35:08] therefore have I spoken
[35:11] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1.
[35:16] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1.
[35:28] I walked before I will walk by back in
[35:30] Psalms here I will walk before the Lord
[35:32] in the land of the living we we move
[35:35] from the Land of the Dead
[35:37] into the land of the living though we
[35:39] walk through the Land of the Dead
[35:42] it's the Paradox of the Christian Life
[35:45] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1.
[35:49] quite a few verses to read here but
[35:51] you'll be seated and you'll get to set
[35:53] the remainder of the service so
[35:55] II Corinthians chapter four therefore
[35:57] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[35:59] received Mercy we think not
[36:03] you have this ministry
[36:06] but you have mercy and you faint not but
[36:09] have renounced the hidden things of
[36:10] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[36:13] handling the word of God deceitfully
[36:15] don't use it to your own gain but by
[36:18] manifestation of the truth commending
[36:20] ourselves
[36:21] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[36:24] the sight of God but if our gospel
[36:26] behind it is hid to them that are lost
[36:29] let me tell you the truth will never be
[36:32] hidden if you find a gospel that's
[36:34] hidden it's a gospel that is not full
[36:38] truth because the devil likes to sneak
[36:40] around
[36:42] and to hide but the Gospel of Truth
[36:44] cannot be hidden
[36:46] you try to hide your life if you're
[36:48] living for Christ people are still going
[36:50] to see it and they're going to recognize
[36:52] that
[36:53] but if our gospel beheaded is hid to
[36:55] them that are lost
[36:57] to whom the God of this world hath
[36:59] blinded the minds of them which believe
[37:01] not lest the light of the Glorious
[37:03] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[37:06] should shine unto them
[37:09] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[37:12] Jesus the Lord and ourselves for your
[37:16] servants for Jesus sake so they see the
[37:18] gospel but they don't understand it
[37:20] that's right
[37:23] I realized what I said kind of sounded
[37:24] like contradictory with what we were
[37:26] reading so to clarify they see the
[37:28] gospel in you they see your life as
[37:30] different and it bothers them it
[37:31] irritates them some of them but because
[37:33] they don't see the truth they don't
[37:35] catch a revelation of the truth for we
[37:38] preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[37:40] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[37:42] Jesus sake for God who commanded the
[37:45] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[37:47] shined in our hearts to give the light
[37:49] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[37:51] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[37:53] this treasure in Earthen vessels that
[37:56] the Excellency of the power may be of
[37:58] God and not of us we're actually going
[38:00] to pause there say a word of prayer and
[38:02] have your seats Heavenly Father Lord
[38:04] Jesus
[38:05] father I pray tonight nothing would be
[38:08] held back for Jesus but father as a as a
[38:11] as a man here I would I desire to give
[38:14] 110 into you father that you would come
[38:18] and you would speak Lord father May the
[38:20] barrier when we break down the barriers
[38:22] of unbelief Lord may you break down the
[38:24] barriers of sin Lord father may you
[38:26] break down the barriers of of
[38:28] preconceived ideas Lord break down the
[38:31] barriers of bias that are within us Lord
[38:33] that we would come and we could hear
[38:35] with you with pure unadulterated hearts
[38:38] Lord I pray you'd speak to us Lord that
[38:40] your word would revive within us Lord
[38:42] pull us from the Earthly and into the
[38:45] Heavenly tonight god father for this
[38:48] world that we live in is Satan's Eden
[38:50] God we're going to claim it back one of
[38:52] these days but as right now it's Satan's
[38:54] eating we don't want to get caught in it
[38:56] father but we want to step into the next
[38:58] Dimension Lord father though we live and
[39:01] then we walk through here father May our
[39:03] lives and our thoughts beyond the glory
[39:06] Lord we love you father we thank you
[39:08] speak to us tonight father have your way
[39:10] may there be no personal opinions father
[39:12] contrary to your word but it'd be your
[39:14] pure word spoken lest our pastor and his
[39:18] wife Lord tonight give him strength in
[39:20] their bodies you pray in Jesus name amen
[39:22] you may be seated
[39:31] so the title tonight like I mentioned
[39:34] already looking at your theophany let's
[39:36] pick back up here in second Corinthians
[39:39] 4 where in verse 7 says but we have this
[39:41] treasure in Earth and vessels that's the
[39:43] Excellency of the power may it be of God
[39:45] and not of us
[39:48] see we don't just want anointing
[39:52] anointing is anointing of God is good
[39:57] but it's not just the anointing it's the
[39:59] combination of the anointing and the
[40:02] word you go too far into just the the
[40:04] the the the the scriptures and the
[40:06] quotes you go too far that way it
[40:08] becomes intellectual and you leave the
[40:10] spirit of Christ you go too far into the
[40:13] anointing you leave the spirit of Christ
[40:15] where you want is you want right in the
[40:16] middle where you have the word and the
[40:18] anointing because that's my brother
[40:21] preached the sermon anointed ones at the
[40:22] end time
[40:24] so so we have so the power may be of God
[40:28] and not of us
[40:29] so who why God chose Earth and vessels
[40:33] why he chose us to to express himself
[40:36] through us
[40:37] to express to who he is in US you see
[40:42] he's expressing himself out through us
[40:44] but at the same time showing us through
[40:47] that expression who we are sometimes we
[40:50] say things and we do things and we go
[40:52] wow what in the world was that god
[40:55] pushing out his life within us so
[40:58] tonight that's what we want to look at
[40:59] looking at your theophany we looking at
[41:03] our theophany but Christ looking at your
[41:06] theophany
[41:07] we are trouble on every side verse 8 yet
[41:10] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[41:12] in despair
[41:14] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[41:17] but not destroyed
[41:19] always bearing about in the body the
[41:22] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[41:24] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[41:27] our body how does that work
[41:30] the dying of the Lord Jesus that the
[41:33] life of the Lord Jesus would be mid
[41:35] manifest in our body but the Bible says
[41:38] the seed has to die and rot to bring
[41:42] forth life we're going to look at that
[41:44] for we which live are all we delivered
[41:47] unto death for Jesus sake that the life
[41:49] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[41:52] our mortal flesh
[41:55] unbelievable
[41:59] that God would use this mortal flesh to
[42:02] manifest himself
[42:03] but yet he's doing it
[42:05] he's showing the power of Christ you say
[42:07] why wouldn't he why wouldn't he make the
[42:09] why wouldn't he just when he changed us
[42:11] why wouldn't he resurrect the flesh as
[42:13] well because he wants his power on
[42:15] display every day
[42:17] he wants to say and look say see what
[42:20] the power of Christ within that Earthen
[42:23] vessel that Rotting Flesh look what it
[42:25] can do it can bring it under subjection
[42:27] to the word of God
[42:29] that's why he dealt the way he did with
[42:30] job that's right
[42:32] that's right so then death worketh in us
[42:35] but life in you we having the same
[42:37] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[42:40] written I believe we just read this I
[42:43] believed and therefore have I spoken he
[42:45] says we also believe and therefore speak
[42:47] knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[42:50] Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus
[42:53] and shall present us with you for all
[42:56] things are for your sakes that the
[42:58] abundant grace might through the
[43:00] Thanksgiving of many redowned to the
[43:02] glory of God for which cars we think not
[43:05] but though our outward man perished yet
[43:07] the inward man is renewed day by day
[43:11] see the flesh is rotting every day it's
[43:13] getting older it's rotting but why
[43:15] because there's something inside that
[43:18] needs that flesh to rot to bring forth
[43:21] that life within us
[43:23] knowing that he would okay
[43:26] for our light Affliction which is but
[43:28] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[43:31] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[43:34] you see the seed in the ground was
[43:37] crying out because he was rotting and
[43:40] dying away
[43:42] but it was birth pains and listening to
[43:45] the tape birth pain it was the birth
[43:47] pains you say why a birthday you think
[43:49] about oh the bringing force of life
[43:50] every time there's a bringing forth of
[43:52] life there's pain involved in that when
[43:55] a baby is born there's great pain
[43:57] involved in that
[43:58] so God had women do it not men
[44:01] because there would be no babies
[44:03] there's great pain when the seed is
[44:06] dying and it's rotting away but what is
[44:08] that that doing the very I mean all of
[44:10] creation right now is dying
[44:14] okay let's also work with me here we
[44:17] don't know what's happening we've never
[44:19] seen fall before
[44:21] and everything's dying
[44:23] Brother David you're going to go out
[44:25] there and you're going to start dumping
[44:26] fertilizer on your trees Jason's going
[44:28] to go be trimming the dead Limbs and
[44:30] he's just going to keep on trimming
[44:31] until there's just a stump
[44:33] because you've never seen fall before
[44:35] okay
[44:38] so you're wondering what's going on
[44:39] what's Happening everything's dying all
[44:41] around you you've never seen fall before
[44:43] but then someone comes along with a
[44:46] Farmer's Almanac
[44:48] oh I don't know what he was some book
[44:51] and says no no stop stop cutting off
[44:54] those branches you think are dead
[44:56] stop stop denying that in your life that
[44:59] you
[45:00] don't understand
[45:02] this is fall
[45:03] and what's happening is everything is
[45:05] dying and going back into the ground
[45:08] because spring winter is coming
[45:11] and when there's a time of harsh weather
[45:14] and it's cold and if the sap of the tree
[45:18] was in the tree the tree would die
[45:20] but the trees going down the the flowers
[45:23] the the bulbs you know the Tulips and
[45:25] stuff the bulb that all the whole plant
[45:27] dies it goes away but the bulb is there
[45:29] down inside the Earth because there's
[45:31] coming a resurrection so you go through
[45:33] winter University Winter before and
[45:36] you're like wow what's going to happen
[45:38] this is it but this is just our life now
[45:41] but then something begins to happen it
[45:44] begins to warm up
[45:46] life begins to start to come and now you
[45:48] see the same thing that died
[45:50] resurrecting itself coming back new life
[45:53] why it had to die and go down to
[45:56] preserve life to bring life again at the
[45:59] appointed season so those same thing the
[46:02] word went down in the Dark Ages as we
[46:04] know to preserve the life so that the
[46:06] life could be born again renewed a seed
[46:10] was planted you planted some uh what is
[46:12] is it onions or garlic you plant in the
[46:15] fall and it comes next spring I think or
[46:17] something like that there are things you
[46:19] plant in the fall that that that that
[46:21] need to be planted at that time of
[46:23] season to bring forth to life later on
[46:25] but that seed had to go down in the
[46:27] ground the seed from the beginning from
[46:29] Pentecost had to be planted so that
[46:31] therefore to bring forth the life from
[46:33] within the seed the seed had to rot and
[46:35] to die amen so
[46:38] um sorry I don't mean to amend myself
[46:43] and me Manning the word I'm reading
[46:45] for our light Affliction which is but
[46:46] for a moment
[46:48] Verse 18 while we took not at look not
[46:50] at the things which are seen But at the
[46:52] things which are not seen
[46:55] he's picking up his message coming up in
[46:57] Hebrews
[46:58] Paul is
[47:02] for the things which are seen are
[47:04] temporal but the things which are not
[47:06] seen are Eternal in other words what you
[47:09] see and what you call real isn't
[47:13] but the things that are not seen are
[47:16] real and eternal
[47:19] for we know we're in chapter five for we
[47:21] know that if our Earthly House of this
[47:23] Tabernacle be dissolved rotted and dead
[47:26] we have a building of God a house not
[47:30] made with hands
[47:31] Eternal in the heavens this flesh was
[47:34] made with hands
[47:36] that you're sitting in tonight that you
[47:38] prettied up and fancied up and handsomed
[47:41] up before church
[47:43] it's made with hands if you will you
[47:46] understand God created life
[47:48] but it comes through the fall so we have
[47:51] to this this is going to be laid down
[47:53] and the Tabernacle dissolve so that we
[47:56] may step into the building of God that's
[47:59] Eternal for in this we groan earnestly
[48:02] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[48:04] house
[48:06] which is from Heaven that's your
[48:09] theophany that's those scripts right
[48:11] there talking about your theophany so
[48:13] we're groaning our bodies are groaning
[48:15] as they age and as they get older and as
[48:18] they rot away they're groaning Desiring
[48:22] because we were not designed we were not
[48:25] this is not what God had in mind if you
[48:28] understand what I'm saying this is not
[48:30] the end
[48:31] see you see every time you see death
[48:33] it's testifying of life every time you
[48:37] see something going down and getting old
[48:39] it's testifying a resurrection why
[48:42] because for every for every opposite for
[48:44] every fake there's a real
[48:48] this expression God showing time and
[48:50] time again that hey look what I desire
[48:53] is that in the fall it would go down but
[48:56] there would be a resurrection he's
[48:58] Desiring an eternal spring
[49:01] an eternal Summer
[49:03] oh God expressing himself to us
[49:05] throughout eternity now in the message
[49:08] who is this Melchizedek says you were
[49:10] there in his attributes you don't
[49:12] remember it no because you're just a
[49:14] part of his life you're a part of God
[49:16] when you become a son or a daughter of
[49:18] God now let me let me just pause there
[49:20] for a second he says you are there in
[49:23] his attributes let me tell you you are
[49:25] an attribute of God Amen amen we talk
[49:27] about the attributes of God and we say
[49:29] you know God had the attribute of healer
[49:31] that he desired to express so he allowed
[49:33] the Fall In the Garden of Eden so that
[49:35] people could be sick so he could well
[49:38] the eventual plan was Redemption but
[49:39] Desiring people would be sick so that he
[49:42] could come and heal them so that's why
[49:44] he come and and he's walking on the
[49:47] shores of Galilee as Jesus he's not
[49:48] hanging out with the Pharisees of the
[49:50] people who don't need him he's going and
[49:52] talking to the prostitute at the well
[49:54] and Samaria Samaria Samaria
[49:57] because he came for those who needed him
[50:00] you see what all men need him yes but he
[50:03] came for those with the desire for him
[50:05] and why do you have that desire you have
[50:08] that desire for him because of
[50:10] predestination because there's a seed in
[50:12] your heart there's a seed in your life
[50:14] so you are an attribute
[50:16] so no different than he had the desire
[50:18] to express his healer he had the desire
[50:20] to express you
[50:23] amen he had a desire to express you
[50:25] today 2000 and 20 and 22.
[50:30] you were born when you were born and
[50:33] that was the time God desired to express
[50:35] you out
[50:36] so let me if you are an attribute of God
[50:40] God's attributes are eternal
[50:44] amen God's thoughts are Eternal it
[50:46] wasn't that that he had a thought
[50:49] I don't have a paper
[50:52] here we go it wasn't that he had a
[50:54] thought
[50:55] and he said oh yeah
[50:57] that's a good idea
[50:59] you wrote it down
[51:00] that would be a beginning
[51:03] but the thoughts that he had of a Healer
[51:06] the thoughts that he had for brother
[51:08] Jason
[51:09] never started
[51:13] because he's Eternal his thoughts are
[51:16] eternal
[51:17] so if you're from eternity because
[51:19] you're an attribute of God
[51:21] you only have one destination
[51:24] and that's back to Eternity
[51:27] back to Eternity what is redeemed taken
[51:30] back
[51:31] that is what redeemed means it is not
[51:33] that God said oh you know I'm going to
[51:35] decide to to choose you Sean and so I'm
[51:39] going to change you no he's taking you
[51:42] back he came and he said now it's time
[51:45] for you to recognize who you are I'm
[51:48] going to show you I'm going to identify
[51:51] myself in you through the expression of
[51:54] my attributes I'm going to identify
[51:57] myself with you by expressing who I am
[52:00] to you so that you can see who you
[52:03] really are
[52:04] you begin to see something let me tell
[52:06] you you know your spirit remembers
[52:09] eternity
[52:10] your soul remembers eternity your soul
[52:14] remembers sitting there with Papa God on
[52:16] the side of the of the bench your soul
[52:19] remembers living in glory without a robe
[52:21] of Flesh your soul remembers and when
[52:24] God came along and he found you because
[52:26] you didn't find God God found you when
[52:29] he came along and he began to speak to
[52:31] you your soul was quick and wide because
[52:34] you remembered
[52:36] eternity
[52:37] something in your soul begin to stir
[52:39] because you recognize you begin to
[52:41] realize I forgot about this Amnesia you
[52:44] had Amnesia see whether I preaching that
[52:46] message about spiritual Amnesia why is
[52:48] it Amnesia and why is it not
[52:51] some other context of of you discovered
[52:54] this cool thing no it's Amnesia because
[52:57] it's already Who You Are
[53:00] do you see the Eternal quality that you
[53:03] have as a son and daughter of God you
[53:05] say oh but I failed or I haven't done
[53:07] this or I haven't done that yet it
[53:10] doesn't matter because there's something
[53:12] in your heart that keeps pushing Back
[53:15] Against The Darkness the light came and
[53:18] the Darkness comprehended it not but
[53:20] that did that stop the light no the
[53:23] light pushed back the dark
[53:26] just as you are a part of your Earthly
[53:28] father that's right you are the male
[53:29] carries the hemoglobin the blood and
[53:32] when that has gone in the egg then you
[53:33] become of your part of your father and
[53:36] your mother is a part of your father
[53:37] also so you're all a part of your father
[53:39] Glory that's that lets denominations out
[53:42] all together he says notice now in
[53:45] notice now his attribute then the
[53:48] attribute was first God the thought the
[53:50] attribute itself all in one without
[53:53] being expressed logos then when he
[53:56] expressed secondarily he became then the
[53:59] word
[54:00] and then the word was made flesh and
[54:03] dwelt Among Us you see he had a thought
[54:05] to step down into a robe of Flesh to be
[54:08] your Kinsmen Redeemer
[54:11] and that thought came to pass one day
[54:13] when he expressed the word and he said
[54:17] Mary why did the angel come down and
[54:20] give verbal message to Mary
[54:22] when he when when the angel Gabriel was
[54:25] if it was Gabriel was speaking to Mary
[54:27] and saying thou are highly favored among
[54:30] men the word if you could see if you
[54:33] could put on your spiritual glasses and
[54:34] look the word was coming forth on that
[54:36] message and going right into the womb of
[54:39] Mary and begin to create
[54:41] begin to move inside of her and when she
[54:44] said
[54:46] be it unto me according to your word the
[54:50] spirit quickened what was inside of her
[54:52] when God when her faith connected with
[54:55] her identity it brought forth life in
[54:58] there and that life began to grow right
[55:01] then and there that cell to start to
[55:04] build upon cell was quickened inside of
[55:07] her womb
[55:08] the spoken word coming forth amen now
[55:12] who is this because I'm gonna quote from
[55:14] who is this Melchizedek many times I
[55:16] recommend you go listen to who is this
[55:18] Melchizedek and identification
[55:22] uh the first identification I think it
[55:24] is but look when those when this body
[55:26] receives the spirit of God The Immortal
[55:28] Life inside of you it knows this body
[55:31] excuse me it throws this body in
[55:34] subjection to God
[55:36] let me read that again when this body
[55:38] receives the spirit of God The Immortal
[55:42] Life inside of you
[55:44] it throws this body in subjection to God
[55:47] he that's born of God does not commit
[55:50] sin he cannot sin Romans 8 1 there is
[55:52] therefore now no condemnation to them
[55:55] that are in Christ Jesus they walk not
[55:57] after the flesh but after the spirit
[55:59] there you are see that throws your body
[56:01] subject
[56:05] now watch then after you recognize the
[56:08] very word of God
[56:10] was Eagle food
[56:19] sorry I I just realized I had some notes
[56:21] missing so let me pause before I read
[56:23] that quote Revelation brings recognition
[56:27] amen recognition brings identification
[56:31] identification brings more Revelation
[56:34] it's one big circle saints of God it's
[56:38] one big circle as you catch the
[56:39] Revelation you recognize Who You Are
[56:42] and then recognizing who you are you
[56:43] become identified with the word of God
[56:46] and when you become identified with the
[56:48] word of God more Revelation breeds upon
[56:51] that when Revelation moves upon that
[56:52] because you say well if that's it then
[56:55] this is it and this is it and this is it
[56:58] and God begins to bring you see why it's
[57:00] so important that you feed on the word
[57:01] of God Amen it can never be
[57:03] overemphasized you gotta feed on the
[57:06] word of God if now this is hard for some
[57:08] people to accept
[57:10] I don't want to say sound negative when
[57:12] I say that let me put it this way
[57:15] you have to feed on the word amen when
[57:18] you're not feeding on the word daily you
[57:20] miss listen the battle is really hot in
[57:23] laodicea
[57:26] it's hotter than it was in time past
[57:30] that's biblical
[57:32] so now 50 years ago
[57:34] wow well I can't say 50 years ago 500
[57:37] years ago
[57:40] the battle was such
[57:43] that sanctification was enough
[57:48] but today the battle is such that you
[57:51] need everything
[57:52] you need the whole complete revelation
[57:54] of Christ in you
[57:58] makes you the complete revelation of
[57:59] Christ right you need all of it so now
[58:02] before just as a metaphor maybe you
[58:06] could miss
[58:07] a day or two of devotions and be okay
[58:13] this is Brother Chris's personal opinion
[58:15] but I believe it's backed by the word
[58:17] you miss one day In the Heat of the
[58:19] battle right now in this day and age
[58:21] that we live in and you're going to
[58:22] begin to struggle
[58:25] it's that important
[58:28] I I I
[58:30] maybe I shouldn't say this so take over
[58:33] the grain of salt but test it out don't
[58:37] don't test it out
[58:39] but next time you find yourself
[58:40] struggling going man what's wrong with
[58:42] me it doesn't have to be it could just
[58:44] be depression
[58:46] ask yourself when's us if you had
[58:47] devotions not read your Bible devotions
[58:51] and you'll find many times it's been too
[58:55] long because when you're not feeding on
[58:57] the word your body always feeds
[59:01] it never stops feeding your body always
[59:03] feeds physically your body always feeds
[59:05] if it's not eating if you're not eating
[59:07] food it's taking the energy stored in
[59:09] your body
[59:09] spiritually is the same way your body's
[59:12] constantly feeding so if you're not but
[59:15] giving it the word of God and even
[59:18] storing up reserves of the word of God
[59:21] riding on the table of your heart
[59:24] you're going to begin to feed on the
[59:26] world
[59:28] you're going to begin to feed on your
[59:30] own ideas and it might be something
[59:32] simple that's not a big deal yet
[59:35] but baby amalekites grow up to be big
[59:37] amalekites
[59:39] so it's very very important that we feed
[59:42] that we prepare ourselves for battle and
[59:44] even even just change the way you
[59:46] approach your devotions in the morning
[59:48] which I hope you have uh I hope you have
[59:50] a rhythm or a
[59:52] you know a part of your morning routine
[59:54] where you spend time with God I would
[59:57] believe that we all have come to a
[59:58] position now in maturity where we
[1:00:00] realize that we need that part of our
[1:00:02] morning if it's not part of your morning
[1:00:03] I challenge you get up earlier
[1:00:07] so um
[1:00:10] well I don't remember what it's going to
[1:00:11] say so we'll just we'll move forward so
[1:00:14] then after you recognize the very word
[1:00:17] of God was Eagle food then you left the
[1:00:20] other thing
[1:00:21] you you have then been formed into the
[1:00:25] living image of the Living God
[1:00:28] you heard from your theophany
[1:00:32] this is not just allegory and nice words
[1:00:36] you heard from your theophany why what
[1:00:40] was that your theophany is the word of
[1:00:42] God Amen the word of God spoke to you
[1:00:45] your soul remembered eternity and that
[1:00:48] the often began to speak to you
[1:00:49] Gabriella begin to say you are better
[1:00:52] than this
[1:00:53] you are better than the situation and
[1:00:56] Life begin to grow inside of you you see
[1:00:59] but you got to just like Mary you have
[1:01:00] to accept it and said be with me no
[1:01:01] matter how hard it is you have to accept
[1:01:03] it
[1:01:04] the living image of the Living God you
[1:01:07] heard from your theophany if this
[1:01:09] Earthly body be dissolved
[1:01:11] so now
[1:01:12] um God another quote here God vindicates
[1:01:15] that that's always been right God
[1:01:17] vindicates it to be true so playing the
[1:01:19] predestinated is the only ones that's
[1:01:21] considered in Redemption did you get it
[1:01:24] let me say that again the predestinate
[1:01:25] is the only one that's considered in
[1:01:27] Redemption
[1:01:28] okay praise the Lord
[1:01:38] the next paragraph 117 being Eternal
[1:01:40] with him
[1:01:41] at the beginning the eternal life that
[1:01:43] you had
[1:01:45] being Eternal with him
[1:01:51] you think you think sometimes
[1:01:54] well we need to preach against split
[1:01:57] skirts and high heels
[1:02:00] we do those things have to be said but
[1:02:05] if we can preach I'm not condemning
[1:02:07] preaching that so we have to be blunt
[1:02:11] if you but you see brother man I'm
[1:02:13] focused his focus wasn't on that he hid
[1:02:16] it but his Focus was not his focus on
[1:02:18] was on recognizing Who You Are
[1:02:22] that was his message revelation of Who
[1:02:24] You Are
[1:02:25] which is an expression of Christ so
[1:02:27] being Eternal with him
[1:02:30] at the beginning the eternal life that
[1:02:32] you had his thought of what you was
[1:02:35] only he wanted he wanted me to stand in
[1:02:38] the pope you see so God had a thought of
[1:02:41] what he wanted you to do Sean he wanted
[1:02:42] you to stand in line at Chick-fil-A and
[1:02:44] take sandwich orders
[1:02:47] he had an Express a thought that he
[1:02:50] wanted you to lay he had he has your
[1:02:52] life laid out Sean you can't mess it up
[1:02:55] he has it laid out in front of you you
[1:02:58] really don't have a say
[1:02:59] but in your heart you don't desire
[1:03:01] anything else
[1:03:03] that's predestination so he said only he
[1:03:06] wanted he wanted me to stand in the
[1:03:08] Pulpit he wanted you to sit in the seat
[1:03:11] tonight
[1:03:12] you are right now fulfilling the will of
[1:03:14] God
[1:03:15] so if you've been concerned that you're
[1:03:17] out of the will of God tonight you are
[1:03:18] in the will of God
[1:03:20] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[1:03:22] so he has an eternal purpose for your
[1:03:23] life and you are playing it out not like
[1:03:26] a robot
[1:03:28] but
[1:03:30] for Destination is he saw
[1:03:32] foreknowledge he saw that you would have
[1:03:35] the desire to serve him he saw that you
[1:03:39] had the desire for the birthright so you
[1:03:41] are playing out what he saw because he
[1:03:45] saw it try to wrap your head around that
[1:03:47] and the one that left home only come to
[1:03:50] the Earth to serve his purpose the body
[1:03:52] the flesh
[1:03:53] to serve his purpose is that right all
[1:03:55] right then after it's finished it's
[1:03:57] brought back in a glorified State it's
[1:04:00] matured and brought back again now
[1:04:02] remember we talked about the seed
[1:04:04] why do not just bear with me why did we
[1:04:07] have to bypass our theophany wouldn't
[1:04:10] that wouldn't it have been better for us
[1:04:12] to just step from glory to glory and
[1:04:15] skip the in between
[1:04:18] wouldn't have been better that way the
[1:04:20] thing is
[1:04:22] you had to come and take on a robe of
[1:04:25] Flesh that's right so that God could be
[1:04:28] glorified
[1:04:30] and that same flesh that's glorifying
[1:04:32] God by being under subjection to his
[1:04:35] word is rotting and dying to bring forth
[1:04:39] life
[1:04:43] some of the some some of our loved ones
[1:04:45] have passed on into Glory
[1:04:48] but they're going to come and that body
[1:04:50] is going to resurrect into their theophy
[1:04:54] they're going to come down and they're
[1:04:55] going to resurrect
[1:04:56] are this flesh we have to be in this
[1:04:59] flesh just like the seed has to go in
[1:05:01] the ground and rot this flesh has to
[1:05:04] it's rotten right now this flesh is
[1:05:06] rotten no good
[1:05:08] but it's not just a byproduct of the
[1:05:11] Fall
[1:05:12] it's God's purpose
[1:05:15] so that it can bring forth the Life of
[1:05:18] Christ
[1:05:20] that's God's Redemption plan right there
[1:05:23] so he he says and then after it's
[1:05:25] finished it's broadcast now it's matured
[1:05:27] the seed will never mature into the
[1:05:31] plant
[1:05:32] another mature into the wheatless it
[1:05:34] first goes in the ground and rots and
[1:05:36] bring forth life so if you just step
[1:05:38] from glory to glory there'd be no
[1:05:39] maturity
[1:05:41] there'd be no expression
[1:05:43] but you see that life is forming and now
[1:05:46] because you take your character with you
[1:05:49] your character is who your spirit man
[1:05:52] the soul excuse me your soul is your
[1:05:57] character is what molded into your soul
[1:05:59] and your soul then steps into the
[1:06:02] glorified body
[1:06:04] and that glorified body amen lines up
[1:06:08] perfectly with the soul the spirit of
[1:06:11] Christ within you and now the whole
[1:06:13] thing is complete now it's a mature
[1:06:16] plant and now you can stand in glory
[1:06:19] because you can never stand in glory in
[1:06:21] this rotten flesh
[1:06:23] praise the Lord
[1:06:26] so God okay praise the Lord
[1:06:28] um
[1:06:31] then he was
[1:06:33] Christ has revealed in his own word
[1:06:35] 1965. then he was made actually human
[1:06:38] flesh and dwelled Among Us in the person
[1:06:40] of Jesus Christ himself born of the
[1:06:43] Virgin Mary he come in that form so he
[1:06:46] could die
[1:06:49] and went back into heaven now in this
[1:06:52] last day he has promised
[1:06:54] to manifest himself in the fullness
[1:06:56] again of his flesh in spirit see
[1:07:00] so he came to die
[1:07:04] and resurrect
[1:07:06] and then he says now in this last day he
[1:07:08] has promised to manifest himself in the
[1:07:11] fullness again death burial Resurrection
[1:07:15] the fullness again if you are God you
[1:07:17] are God in flesh you're going to mimic
[1:07:21] Christ but you could not do it until he
[1:07:25] first came and broke the last barrier of
[1:07:28] death
[1:07:29] now you have this you have the ability
[1:07:31] through his anointing because he's paid
[1:07:33] the price for you to complete the
[1:07:35] picture Death burial Resurrection
[1:07:40] all three of these
[1:07:42] so he came the Flesh and the spirit for
[1:07:44] as it was in the days of solemn so shall
[1:07:45] be in the coming of the son of man now
[1:07:48] look at the Sodom how it's set and what
[1:07:50] taking place and Jesus Christ being
[1:07:52] manifested in bodily form of his church
[1:07:54] today see doing the same thing same work
[1:07:57] same things that he did all the time
[1:08:00] never changes the Eternal one so if he
[1:08:03] came to die you came to die too
[1:08:07] amen you stepped out of Glory To Die
[1:08:11] see and upon Earth today he was
[1:08:13] manifested himself in the human bodies
[1:08:16] Our human body is that he has called and
[1:08:18] done exactly the same thing that he'd
[1:08:20] done thing he done in Sundry times in
[1:08:22] the times of his flesh upon Earth so
[1:08:25] he's doing the same thing today
[1:08:31] now per gift 142 the next now the next
[1:08:34] thing happens is when it's all gathered
[1:08:36] up into that one person Jesus Christ
[1:08:37] bride and body at the physical Return of
[1:08:40] the Lord Jesus
[1:08:42] trying to get to the part I want I want
[1:08:45] to read
[1:08:46] and the the woman and man is just so
[1:08:49] close together
[1:08:53] uh next next next yes and the woman and
[1:08:57] the man and man is just so close
[1:08:58] together tell they're just almost they
[1:09:02] are the same
[1:09:06] next time someone tells you how dare you
[1:09:09] say your God and flesh
[1:09:11] this quote
[1:09:12] was also in 1965. so for all those
[1:09:16] naysayers that say Well it has to be
[1:09:17] after 63.
[1:09:21] he says they are the same they ought to
[1:09:23] be anyhow there they are see they just
[1:09:26] exactly manifested the same she is a
[1:09:30] part of him because she was taken out
[1:09:33] from him you see who what was that what
[1:09:36] was the representation of of our
[1:09:38] relationship with Christ Adam and Eve
[1:09:39] Eve was taken from Adam you are a actual
[1:09:44] part of Christ
[1:09:46] for Christ for for us to get to the end
[1:09:49] of this whole thing and you do not be
[1:09:51] there if you're a son or daughter of God
[1:09:53] and you would not be there which you
[1:09:54] just keep believing you are
[1:09:59] it wouldn't be complete
[1:10:02] we'd get there and God would be
[1:10:04] incomplete if you will he'd be missing
[1:10:06] an arm
[1:10:10] because she was taken out from him and
[1:10:13] the bride today is taken out from the
[1:10:15] body of Christ which is acting and doing
[1:10:18] just exactly like he said it would do
[1:10:22] for this day the bride the Queen the
[1:10:25] king and the Queen
[1:10:27] so he had to come Christ had to come
[1:10:29] down and a robe of Flesh to die
[1:10:32] just like the seed has to die okay
[1:10:35] we have to come down and bypass our
[1:10:37] theophany so that the Life of Christ
[1:10:39] could be born in us through the death
[1:10:42] and rotting of our flesh
[1:10:45] but it would have it would end there
[1:10:49] if
[1:10:50] because we without Christ have no
[1:10:53] victory over death
[1:10:55] but he came before us and he took the
[1:10:59] Stinger from death
[1:11:03] so all this time so no I hope I by God's
[1:11:06] grace you understand
[1:11:09] so all this time you're walking in flesh
[1:11:11] and you're and you're living in this
[1:11:13] robe of Flesh and and God's done
[1:11:15] redemption in your life and you are
[1:11:18] serving God and you look at this
[1:11:24] well
[1:11:25] I'm mad at my wife again
[1:11:29] well I growing up for every reason it
[1:11:32] was always you know the preacher always
[1:11:34] said kick the dog so I just
[1:11:36] automatically use that example oh I
[1:11:38] kicked the dog again I don't know where
[1:11:40] that came from don't kick it
[1:11:43] I did it again I stuck my foot in my
[1:11:45] mouth or or I did something I shouldn't
[1:11:47] have there's something wrong I did I did
[1:11:49] it again you're looking at the flesh
[1:11:55] now do you want me to tell you what
[1:11:57] God's looking at
[1:12:01] all this time he isn't looking at you in
[1:12:04] your flesh
[1:12:05] because he doesn't know your flesh
[1:12:08] if you will
[1:12:10] the way a husband and wife know each
[1:12:12] other it's not your flesh that God knows
[1:12:15] God doesn't know your flesh that's right
[1:12:17] you say but but I did this
[1:12:20] God said I don't see it
[1:12:25] God has a forgetting problem
[1:12:28] every time you put something out of the
[1:12:30] blood he forgets it
[1:12:32] that's that's truth
[1:12:36] 100 percent
[1:12:38] God does the all-knowing omniscient
[1:12:41] all-power for God doesn't remember your
[1:12:44] sin amen
[1:12:47] he doesn't remember it you remember it
[1:12:49] the devil remembers it but God does not
[1:12:52] remember it
[1:12:53] also the devil is not all-knowing just
[1:12:55] so you know
[1:12:57] and he can't read your mind
[1:13:02] don't give the devil too much power amen
[1:13:05] all this time God isn't looking at you
[1:13:08] in your flesh
[1:13:10] he is looking at your theophany amen
[1:13:13] because that's who you really are that's
[1:13:15] exactly
[1:13:16] because your theophany is a
[1:13:18] representation of Christ within you amen
[1:13:22] this flesh contradicts
[1:13:25] the spirit of Christ inside of you but
[1:13:27] your theophany is a perfect
[1:13:29] representation of the spirit of Christ
[1:13:32] inside of you every day you see this
[1:13:34] flesh come underneath subjection to the
[1:13:36] word of God because God's word is that
[1:13:39] powerful because he created all things
[1:13:41] and all things are underneath his
[1:13:43] subjection but God doesn't look at your
[1:13:47] flesh God looks at your theophany if
[1:13:50] you're under the blood
[1:13:53] you still have your part to play repent
[1:13:56] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:58] and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:59] you still have your part to play
[1:14:04] but you will play it
[1:14:06] you will play it
[1:14:08] he is looking at your theophany who you
[1:14:10] really are which is the word of God
[1:14:13] expressed his attribute
[1:14:16] you see saying to God the power that God
[1:14:19] has put within us the power that God has
[1:14:22] expressed to us we are literally a part
[1:14:25] of Eternity amen
[1:14:28] this this finite Minds Can't Wrap our
[1:14:31] heads around that
[1:14:33] and I might sound contradicting but you
[1:14:36] don't need to figure it out
[1:14:39] stop trying to figure out God
[1:14:42] I've I've counseled with with with
[1:14:44] different people about all the questions
[1:14:46] that they have and it's like look stop
[1:14:49] questioning
[1:14:50] and just accept it
[1:14:52] when I was growing up I I I math was
[1:14:55] hard I I wanted to know why
[1:14:58] now down the line I realize why God made
[1:15:00] me that way but I wanted to know why why
[1:15:03] why why why
[1:15:04] and I was like I was told look
[1:15:06] and there's an element of proof to this
[1:15:08] look don't worry about why just do the
[1:15:10] formula and you'll get the right answer
[1:15:13] you see God has a formula
[1:15:16] now
[1:15:18] you know in in uh in programming
[1:15:22] we can do we can do we can get the same
[1:15:25] result a lot of different ways
[1:15:28] but there's only one or there's only
[1:15:31] there's but there's a right way to do it
[1:15:33] and put let me put make it simple put it
[1:15:35] that way there's many ways to do things
[1:15:36] to make what you see as the client when
[1:15:39] you open the application on the web and
[1:15:41] to see it you'll see the same thing but
[1:15:43] I did it wrong
[1:15:45] so it won't last it'll break
[1:15:48] it might be good for a little bit but
[1:15:50] then it breaks might be good for a
[1:15:51] little bit then it breaks see that's
[1:15:52] what people in their life they try to to
[1:15:54] manufacture of being a Christian some of
[1:15:57] you sitting here tonight might be trying
[1:15:58] to do that manufacturing being Christian
[1:16:01] you wonder why all it's just a struggle
[1:16:03] and how do people live this life look
[1:16:04] what you have to do is die die
[1:16:08] you have to die and you got to say look
[1:16:10] it can be as simple as this look I don't
[1:16:12] understand how this works Lord
[1:16:14] um
[1:16:15] but
[1:16:17] I want to serve you
[1:16:19] and that's it and then you just spoke
[1:16:21] the word
[1:16:24] maybe your life isn't lining up with the
[1:16:25] word at the time but speak the word
[1:16:27] maybe you are keep losing the victory
[1:16:30] with the sand or something in your life
[1:16:32] or anger in your life or something you
[1:16:34] keep losing the victory
[1:16:35] just start speaking the word
[1:16:38] don't focus on your problem focus on the
[1:16:42] one with the solution
[1:16:44] don't focus on it don't don't even try
[1:16:46] let me say something that might sound a
[1:16:49] bit radical don't even try to change
[1:16:50] yourself don't even try to stop
[1:16:53] lusting or stop smoking or whatever
[1:16:55] whatever it is stop getting having a
[1:16:57] taper don't try don't put your energy in
[1:16:59] stopping that
[1:17:01] instead put more time and energy into
[1:17:04] God's word
[1:17:06] when you go to open your Bible if you've
[1:17:07] got to sit in your life that's that's
[1:17:09] condemning you've got something in your
[1:17:10] life that's condemning you
[1:17:12] um
[1:17:13] maybe you didn't have the courage to
[1:17:14] make to go to go repent about it yet
[1:17:17] just and and just open the word and
[1:17:19] start to read and the devil's going to
[1:17:21] come and say how dare you read the
[1:17:22] scriptures with this thing in your life
[1:17:26] he's going to be whispering in your ear
[1:17:27] but guess what when the devil's talking
[1:17:29] it's because he's scared
[1:17:31] that's right
[1:17:32] he doesn't bother he didn't bother when
[1:17:34] you're doing exactly what he wants you
[1:17:36] to do
[1:17:37] he's like that boss I never tells you
[1:17:39] when you're doing good
[1:17:40] or
[1:17:42] that sounds weird but he's like that
[1:17:44] boss that never tells you hey you're
[1:17:45] doing a good job all you ever hear is
[1:17:46] when you're doing bad same thing all
[1:17:49] time the only time that I've ever talks
[1:17:51] to you I mean it's the opposite is when
[1:17:52] you're doing good
[1:17:54] he wants to tell you how you know how
[1:17:56] dare you
[1:17:57] and you put on a tape and you begin to
[1:17:59] feel condemned and you begin to feel all
[1:18:00] these things but let me tell you
[1:18:02] something
[1:18:03] this word the word of God and the
[1:18:07] messages are on the tapes are not just
[1:18:10] words
[1:18:13] there's life in them do you know why
[1:18:16] do you know why because they're God's
[1:18:19] thoughts
[1:18:22] that's right this book if you will is no
[1:18:24] different than
[1:18:26] you know the words in this book if you
[1:18:27] all know different in the words on this
[1:18:29] page
[1:18:30] Naturally Speaking
[1:18:33] but these words aren't God's thoughts
[1:18:36] these are God's thoughts have creative
[1:18:40] power there's something going on in your
[1:18:43] home and I challenge you to do this
[1:18:45] maybe you'll see the effects right away
[1:18:47] it might take time but I challenge you
[1:18:49] to find a scripture in your Bible that
[1:18:52] represents the opposite of what your
[1:18:55] house is doing
[1:18:56] and every morning get up
[1:18:59] for anyone else is up and out loud read
[1:19:02] the scripture amen
[1:19:05] don't don't try to you know grab the
[1:19:07] wall we rebuke you Satan
[1:19:10] no
[1:19:11] just speak the word amen say and maybe
[1:19:15] it's just you in your room maybe you're
[1:19:18] a young person in your room there's
[1:19:19] something you're struggling with walk in
[1:19:20] your room tonight shut the door
[1:19:22] and don't say I rebuke you no there's a
[1:19:25] time for that but don't do that find a
[1:19:27] scripture in your Bible that speaks
[1:19:29] Victory to your atmosphere and create
[1:19:32] that atmosphere
[1:19:34] but guess what as soon as you start to
[1:19:36] do that the devil is going to come with
[1:19:38] a couple other Buddies
[1:19:40] so you got to do it again the next day
[1:19:42] and again the next day and again the
[1:19:45] next day and next thing that you know
[1:19:47] you're going to be walking in Victory
[1:19:49] and you're going to look and say wow I
[1:19:52] don't have chains rattling on my feet
[1:19:54] anymore
[1:19:55] well I haven't even thought about
[1:19:57] wanting to do that thing or go to that
[1:20:00] website I haven't even considered that
[1:20:02] why because the atmosphere that you're
[1:20:05] living in has been regenerated by the
[1:20:08] power of Christ you had that ability to
[1:20:11] say to God you had that ability it's not
[1:20:13] so much although those services are good
[1:20:16] and you are and things are delivered but
[1:20:18] it's more take the word home and put it
[1:20:21] to use take the word tonight what's been
[1:20:24] spoken don't leave the anointing here in
[1:20:27] the building
[1:20:28] don't leave what's been said here
[1:20:30] for brother Chris to take home and and
[1:20:33] think about how he could have said it
[1:20:35] better take the word of God the quotes
[1:20:37] the spoken and go and do what it says to
[1:20:42] do
[1:20:42] the word on tape play it in your house I
[1:20:47] don't care if you feel anointed I don't
[1:20:50] care what the situation is put the tape
[1:20:53] on and play it every day
[1:20:56] keep on playing keep on playing it I
[1:20:59] know someone who was struggling with
[1:21:00] depression and guilt feelings of guilt
[1:21:03] even though it was all taken care of and
[1:21:06] under the blood the devil was coming and
[1:21:08] reminding them and I said you know what
[1:21:10] you need to do
[1:21:11] start playing the tapes
[1:21:13] start playing the good worship music
[1:21:16] start reading the Bible and you know
[1:21:18] what that person is so happy
[1:21:20] so free and so light today why because
[1:21:24] the word began to create an atmosphere I
[1:21:27] can't come home with you and do it for
[1:21:29] you
[1:21:31] amen I have my own house to take care of
[1:21:34] my own house to take care of
[1:21:37] every man is responsible for what's in
[1:21:40] his condition responsible for his
[1:21:42] condition of his house
[1:21:45] maybe you you know a young person again
[1:21:48] and there's something in your house
[1:21:50] that's getting the victory over
[1:21:53] the soul
[1:21:56] there's a scripture in Joshua that says
[1:21:58] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:22:01] Lord we hang that on the picture
[1:22:03] nice in our homes guess what that
[1:22:05] applies to your fleshly house as well
[1:22:08] that could be your scripture
[1:22:10] that can be your scripture remind
[1:22:12] yourself of that scripture put it on a
[1:22:14] little index card laminated and put it
[1:22:15] in your pocket and when you're at work
[1:22:17] and you touch it you remember as for me
[1:22:19] and my house we served like this stuff
[1:22:21] is not denominational ideas this is
[1:22:24] putting the word of God in action and
[1:22:27] sometimes this is the kind of preaching
[1:22:29] that we need more of is God is it
[1:22:32] Brother David and brother Paul preaching
[1:22:35] and we're getting the word of God to put
[1:22:37] into action
[1:22:40] I don't want you to leave tonight and be
[1:22:42] like what do we talk about
[1:22:44] what did we do I felt really good but
[1:22:46] what do I do what do I do now there is
[1:22:49] practical applications that you can
[1:22:52] start tonight it's your house in your
[1:22:54] life that God and watch God begin to
[1:22:57] give you
[1:22:58] Victory give me victory over bitterness
[1:23:01] give you victory over unforgiveness give
[1:23:03] you the ability to say whether that
[1:23:06] person has treated you any other way it
[1:23:08] does not matter to you you've forgiven
[1:23:09] them
[1:23:12] and you pray that God one day
[1:23:15] that they hear from their theophany
[1:23:18] amen let's bow our heads
[1:23:21] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:23:24] Lord we want to remember
[1:23:27] we're going to go from here in this this
[1:23:29] building this this church we come and we
[1:23:33] sit in a certain triggers in our brain
[1:23:35] and different things but
[1:23:38] at the same time this is what you called
[1:23:40] us to
[1:23:42] you called us to be here
[1:23:44] it might feel like a habit sometimes but
[1:23:48] there's something in us that desires
[1:23:50] more it might be the same scriptures but
[1:23:53] it's the Living Word of God
[1:23:56] Lord I pray that they wouldn't we
[1:23:59] wouldn't leave the word here tonight but
[1:24:00] we would take it home with us
[1:24:02] Lord this day this scripture is
[1:24:05] fulfilled

[1:24:31] but that's one thing Lord but the the
[1:24:33] other side of it is Habitual sin I pray
[1:24:37] God that you would come
[1:24:38] and break the chains that may be binding
[1:24:42] some of our belief Believers tonight
[1:24:45] some of our brothers and sisters suppose
[1:24:47] they would find the freedom
[1:24:50] that we talk about they would find the
[1:24:51] freedom that we live in
[1:24:53] God that the devil would not have his
[1:24:56] say or his way anymore
