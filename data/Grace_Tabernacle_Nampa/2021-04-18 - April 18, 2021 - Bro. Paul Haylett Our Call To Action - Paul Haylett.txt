couple weeks from now just wanted to put that out early so you'll know amen uh we want to just today uh also just um happy to see our brother i i have a my own personal prayer request brother bob sister joanne for you this morning but you're here amen and uh praise the lord that's the prayer answered before we even prayed it as it were so glad to see them brother prashant sister koncha uh just things happening there i think they'll announce those or share those things on their own but uh just uh they were sharing some things with me that uh god just answering prayers for them and um you know just very very happy for them and we want to remember our brother sergey he's in north carolina where he was anyway last night uh there with um sister yulia's uh family and uh just good shared a picture and stuff and just remember the whole family you know sister yulia's brother philip i go all the way back met him the first time uh at uh um brother ivan's sister uh nadia's wedding and um i just really love him and you know sometimes the devil wants to stir the pot cause little ism scissors things so just just remember all of her family and lift them up before the lord uh brother chris uh and sister kristin um are camping i believe so we'll just remember them for traveling mercies today and um so just good to be here today and i just really was happy to receive this phone call yesterday uh morning uh my brother george sends his greetings to you he appreciates your prayers he he let me know that maybe the news that was spread was maybe a little overstated he wasn't um he wasn't about dead when he went to the hospital unresponsive um he i i won't i won't put it out kind of some of the words that he said but he just said you know sometimes your family overreacts and uh so but it's better overreact than under react and um the lord just touching him and we have to remember brother george is getting getting a little bit older and uh he just got back from colombia south america uh you know so he he's committed he is not going to stop traveling the world sharing the gospel until the lord calls him home so you know i just um i just like to see him you know be alive and remain at the coming of the lord still preaching the gospel so definitely uh continue to lift him up in prayer and so we try to hold him hostage to commitments and when he's healthy he says he'll do his very best to come see us so pray for him amen let's just stand to our feet this morning for the reading of the word once again speaking on this overall topic of redemptions manifestation you know i struggled for a title this morning as it were but i believe that we can maybe take this as an overall encompassing uh title or call to action that's what the word has done for you and i it's called us to action not to just sit and say well okay if god wants it to happen it'll happen but there's something in the heart of sons and daughters of god now you know we know this is not a works gospel right it's not going to be that we've done great deeds and therefore we're rewarded for them but it's all christ but remember we were chosen right that's what the word says we were chosen in him so therefore we are part of him right we're we're not just some after thought or some thing that's out there but before the foundation of the world god said i'm gonna i'm gonna call you and so while many people there's different doctrines different teachings that believe that you can kind of work your way to heaven this call of action that is taking place in the life of sons and daughters of god is not an obligation that we must do but there's just something in us can we say amen to that today there's just something in us that we read the word of god we hear the word of god preached and something in us says i want to do that i want to be part of that and uh you know as an old friend of mine used to say he was quite competitive in sports and and uh he would say everyone wants to be on the winning team but you know the reality of that is not true some are not willing to pay the price to be on the winning team and you look at that to sacrifice even in the natural that is required uh you know i had a friend that was quite quite accomplished in sports uh he is you know christian believer invited to go play soccer for madrid and those of you that know anything about soccer know that they're one of the big national world level teams invited to go play soccer for them and um it's it's a very lovely story and for the sake of time we won't go into it but to recognize that it's not just i'm talented and i can kick a ball and i can make it go where i wanted to go there was extreme sacrifice that was involved now this brother his father is a pastor a very godly man a very sincere man and he he put the question to his son and says son um what is it that you want to do what where where is your where is your direction in life and and he says i i love soccer dad and he says what other direction there's a certain young lady of which he is married now and and they have a couple children very happily married and his father was very troubled and the lord woke him up one night and said give this word to your son and the word was if you go you'll never serve me pretty strong words and for one that had a passion for something he had to stop and say what is my real goal who am i what is important to me and what sacrifice am i willing to make but then when god using his own father natural father says if you go you'll never serve me you see god was putting the period on the end it's no longer a question mark it's a period and i'm going to make a profound statement to you saints that when it comes to action there are certain actions you don't need to pray about you see my dear friend did not need to go and pray and say now lord if my dad is right and you really did speak to him is this really what is going to happen see he knew his unnatural dad who is also his pastor he knew him as a godly man he didn't need to say okay god is this the final answer is this what it he had heard the word the word says you go you will never serve me now think about this he was only going to be on probation as a soccer player and they were going to give him a house and a car and a few hundred thousand dollars the carnal attraction is so incredible but he heard the word of the lord he didn't need to pray about it that's right he needed to either accept it as truth or not now let me just apply this to several things we won't go into it's not really my thought today the scripture says by his stripes you're healed do you have to go pray about lord is it your will that i'm healed take action scripture says if you'd repent and be baptized you'd receive the gift of the holy ghost do you have to pray about that you see there's some things we just need to come to saints that we simply accept what the word said at face value we don't have to go and say does that apply to me is this what i should do should i claim my healing should i claim the holy ghost no accept it take action these are the declarations if i would use that word of the scripture that god drove the post as a friend of mine put it this way he says you know i don't understand what's wrong now forgive me those of you live in the city most of you forgive me but a friend of mine is like what part of no trespassing do these city people not understand it says no trespassing now my brother and sister let me turn that around for example when the word says yes don't accept no from anyone else when the word says receive don't say i'll have to go see if that applied to me act on the word take action hallelujah amen our call to action praise the lord let's go into the scripture in first samuel the second chapter verses one through three now saints i just want to clarify something with you and um you know we started in this redemption series uh to speak on the three kinds of believers but i'll just be honest with you i'm having a very very hard time uh fulfilling that because i find myself drawn well let me put it this way the only excitement there is is preaching to the believer i i i can't get excited i mean it's necessary but i can't get excited about preaching to the person that's going to reject all that god has offered and say nope i want this moment of pleasure i'm going to do what i'm going to do and it's hard to focus and really present or pour yourself into preaching to the person that goes through all of the labor they live right they talk right they dress right they go to church but they just can't quite take the last step i i'll be honest with you i i just struggle with the idea of getting excited about preaching to somebody that's going to run the race now let this is a poor analogy but i think it's very vivid enough they run the race with all that is within them and they get to the finish line and they say well i've got close enough everyone knows i'm a finisher i could cross that line but they don't you know in the natural we would look at them and say what's wrong with you i don't know if you've seen the little video that had circulated some time back i believe the man was from kenya they were running i don't remember i believe it was either a steeple chase or a marathon reason i think it was a steeple chase is because it was in hilly terrain but it could still been a marathon and this this man is exhausted i mean he has run the race but he has a substantial lead on the closest person and it comes to this two or three angled intersection and the way the sign is it's there saying finish line but it didn't really clearly point it out and it had some ribbons that kind of went off to the side but this man comes and he's exhausted and he stops and he's got his hands on his knees he thought finish line but you see the finish line was over here another 100 yards and the man who was behind him second place got roundly criticized around the world for not just passing him and winning but he realized this man did not stop because he gave up he stopped because it was confusing where the finish line was and he thought he had reached it and the man in his exhaustion is stopped there and this guy there's a language barrier praise god the holy ghost doesn't know language barriers this man comes and he's trying to talk to him and he's motioning and he's trying to gesture and he knew just a few words of french and he's trying to do it and finally just takes a holds of this man if you ever find the video you'll see it it's just beautiful he takes a hold of this man and the man ends up putting his arm around him and he leads him to the finish line and when he gets right to the line he stops and pushes the man across in front of him and everybody said you could have won the prize you could have had the title why didn't you do this and he says because i couldn't have faced my mother come on oh my brother and sister i say god help us i'm sorry i can't get excited that man didn't quit somebody confused him something confused him there's a lot of difference between the confusing confusion of the end time and the desire to reach the finish line so let's not get confused there but what about those that run the race and simply stop reminds me another video i hope you don't mind share this i want to drive these points home to you of a young man running i think it was in the college level he just flat out runs everyone and he gets up to the finish line and he's already jumping up in the air ah yeah yeah yeah yeah and this other guy let's not celebrate too early which means giving up stopping losing our focus we have a call to action part of that action finish the race you've been given the ability you've been called finish the race don't let anything stop you from finishing the race first samuel second chapter verses one through three and hannah prayed now first samuel here such a lovely lovely scripture uh we see a a a a daughter of god anointed of god you know she's had struggle in her life people have judged her for not having a child and you know even even the priest is hard on her because he sees her just you know in another realm she's just slipped off into another realm and and she is crying out to god and and the priest thinks that she's either drunk or crazy but she knows her heart and she says no no no i'm i'm clean of heart i'm i'm coming before god honestly what i'm doing and you look at this now it says and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoices in the lord my horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the lord there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god i say we can pray hannah's prayer we can speak hannah's words talk no more so exceedingly proud proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed and only by him it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks it's how god judges the action now let's remember we have god's words in written form so we can't say the lord told me and go conquer contrary to this right so there's no going off deviating and saying well the lord told me to do this but it's by our action or reaction to this that we are weighed heavenly father we thank you today for your grace for your mercy lord just bless our visitors father you bless each one father those that are not with us today may your holy spirit just reach out and touch in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated you see we've been given a call to action and in that my brother and sister we will find that the response to the call to action is very interesting um you'll see some believe that the church was called to activism and uh to to take up a cause and by its definition you might say that that would be true but also by its definition it says it's mostly centered in a political or social realm and so that we as the church my brother and sister uh are called to share the gospel now my brother and sister the word of god the world's full of bibles but yet you'll come and and as brother berry coffee has great connections in africa uh there are still christians new believers that have no access to a bible uh bibles that literally are so worn out the pages are falling out of them and and so you look at that and realize that that uh the life that is in the word of god it is not just something we share you don't just give a bible and assume that's going to make the difference in a person's life but there has to be the gospel which is the life behind the word and so if we have a call to activism to take up a cause uh as a church and if we focus into political or social realms now my brother and sister i'm going to say some very direct things so please don't be offended but my brother and sister you can go stand on a street corner and be identified and you can hold up a sign that condemns the actions of others all you want but that will not change their life amen activism to go and shout in people's face and push and do all of these things force your literature or thoughts upon others and say well we're the church we're called to do this that's a misunderstanding of going to all the world amen and so while we want to do that we will find that we will have a greater change or influence on the lives around us when those people recognize that we are not of this world when we are not like everyone else you might say so it's there that uh this call to activism uh just you know sometimes little influences come and just listening to a pastor and circumstance i won't get specific or take the time but you know talking about we need to rise up and we need to to be in this certain church's defense we need to do this we need to force our legislature to do this and this my brother and sisters see they're losing focus the energy that they should have preaching the gospel the changing of lives is now spent or burnt up in activism so it's there that we realize we do at the right time according to the leadership of the holy spirit need to raise up our voices not be muted not be quiet but my brother and sister is not to go out into the realm i'm just reading a little article the other day uh these people believe that by 2030 with a good pressure from christians that we can change the fundamental direction of the united states but i'm telling you that united states has made her decision she values her position she has she's rich and has need of nothing but yet she is poor and naked and blind this is according to the word of god so we'll recognize that a misguided understanding of what an action or the actions we're called to as christians leads people into this political or social realm believing that's what's going to change people's lives what changes lives is the presence of god and not having a form of godliness but having god on the inside amen so a new birth is what changes people greatest form if you want to call it activism that's great the greatest form of activism we should be searching for is a new birth amen there is something that will change a life forever amen now activism requires uh time and commitment you know part of this same deal that i was reading they're looking for people that will go and stand on the steps of their state capital seven days a week lest they forget that we the people well my brother and sister that requires great time great commitment someone's going to miss church that is if they attend see you can be religious and not bother to fulfill the word of god you can take a position and say well you know the churches are messed up the preachers are messed up all of this i don't need to go to church because they're messed up well that doesn't get you around the word of god amen so it's not a you know get out of jail free it's not a pass go collect 200 exemption card i don't care what your thinking is what does the word say the word says you won't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as you see that day approaching so either they don't see that day approaching or they don't believe their bible and it comes down just pretty basic amen i hope this is not too straight so there nowhere in the scripture and this is just something that struck me i put down on the page here nowhere in this scripture says go into all the world and be an activist hallelujah but we've been called with supernatural calling you say brother paul you you bring that up a lot that's right because the devil's out here trying to tell you that you're not the devil constantly bombarding us with all the reasons why not well it should be fair time fair game to just bombard you with all the reasons why amen but have you ever noticed now you might not unless you delve in this realm that people will be bombarded by the devil and just build a tolerance to that but when they come to church they need to hear something new and exciting they don't want to hear the same old gospel they want to hear something that gets them excited but you see it's actually the scripture declares that me brother david brother chris is good ministers of the gospel we're not going to come and bring you something new and exciting we're going to come the scripture says and stir up your pure minds in remembrance of what has already been brought to you so i'm sorry if i'm not too exciting with something new but i do want to do my job of stirring up your pure minds well i want to stir up your pure mind right not corrupted minds pure minds this is god's outlook or god's view to you as pure mind and my job is just to keep stirring it up remember he said this about you remember he said this about you remember he said this about you hallelujah i don't have to have something new i just have to stir up your pure mind that you remember he called you righteous and he called you holy and he called you worthy and he called you his we just stir up the pure mind in remembrance of those things the devil says well you know look you can still serve him and kind of serve me too but you know the word of god says that a man cannot have two masters he's going to follow one and loath the other follow one forsake the other now you say i'll follow one part time and one part time the scripture says that a man that's unstable is in unstable in all of his ways so there's no this wishy-washy going back and forth right so we have to decide and this is why i've had a trouble my brother and sister preaching on the other two segments because you see i'm not interested i am interested in the people themselves but i'm not interested in the concept of or the presentation of that um the unbeliever you see if the unbeliever could care less would even curse you for mentioning god to him in that context they'll use god's name in any other way but you mention it to him in salvation and they'll curse you for it i've been there and the person that won't finish the race imagine imagine if we could force them to finish the race you'd just walk out in the church and you'd grab them by their caller and they'd be saying i don't want to and you'd be saying i don't care and you drag them kicking and screaming up front and then you would hold them at the altar for a prescribed time tick tick tick tick and then you would pull them from the altar and you would take them over here to the baptismal tank and maybe that's where you would get it done because you would hold them under for a prescribed time and when they came out they would be a good christian you imagine what church would look like we'd have about 10 guys the size of brother ivan brother jason because there would be no one that would be free from our conversion and that does happen in certain places yeah sometimes it's mental emotional but those should be called abuse not conversions but you see the real truth of it is what happens is some things happen down in the soul and it's the soul that gets the body out of the chair it's not the mind it's not the intellectual understanding it's the soul that moves the person from the chair to the altar to the baptism to the infilling of the holy ghost it's something on the inside and so god totally removed man's ability now we can explain the gospels my brother and sister of what happened here and what happened there and why this happened we can do that but that will not change the soul that's why we have way too much intellectual understanding of the message of the word of god because somebody said now this is here and this is here and this is here i still have to laugh about this you know brother prashant i ask him brother prashan what are you working on now and he goes well i'm sorry brother paul i don't know any other way to explain it to you than to tell you this grain of sand has now been made more intelligent than you i get it brother i understand exactly what you said how can you take a piece of silica or whatever it is and you do these and somehow electrical charge and then it will now sorry i'll just stick with putting seeds in dirt and irrigating it and keeping the weeds out because that's a concept i understand and besides this i say this in good humor if brother prashant sister conch are listening today nowhere in the scripture do you find anything about taking pieces of sand and making it intelligent but you can find the farmer in scripture so i say that to make myself feel good because i don't have a clue what they're doing but you see we're not called with a natural calling that we explain how that this energized and this has now intelligence and has memory we're called with a supernatural calling and the supernatural calling my brother and sister god chose those that were poor and weak and unintelligent amen even so much that it was praised in the scripture lord thank you for hiding it from the wise and the prudent and revealing it to babes and i say thank you lord amen that he take this that we didn't have to have an intellectual understanding to grasp why it is that god chose you and i before the foundation of the world what we have to do is act upon the word that says he did and when the word says he already has done this work in you what we need to do is take and put that to action and say i believe i believe this work has already been begun in me and when the scripture says that he finishes everything that he starts we should be able to take and put that in action and say i am a finished work of god but but brother paul but brother so and so sister so and so you have this little issue and you have this little issue i don't care about how you see the issue i see the word of god that says i'm a finished work in jesus christ he says not only that that i am perfect in him and that i am righteous in him and i am holy in him i don't need to understand how that it happened i need to accept it and take the action and by taking the action i make it real in my life and then when i make it real in my life i start to apply it and as i apply it my life changes can someone say amen to that and so as our life changes we start to realize that our god is not a god that comes around every once in a while but he's an ever-present god who knows our every situation and cares enough to correct us have words i could share with you the words of a man i know concerning his children but i can't use a kind of language in the house of god but the man just turned his kids loose to become whatever they become because he said they were a child of and he used heaven now my brother and sister how could a man say that about his own children but yet those words would anoint his household have enough liberty with this man to look him in the face and say you know what you're just causing yourself more problems buddy you need to just stop saying that and you need to say my kids are going to grow up to be awesome adults productive and respectful and whatever and he's like why would i say that i said because what you say right here is what will come to pass in your children's life i think he believed i don't hear him say those words either that or he just doesn't say him in front of me but my brother and sister you see that's how it is the word says your body will obey your confession take action on that hallelujah i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm struggling i have things that look like worldly habits and worldly thoughts and worldly whatever i like to listen to worldly music but i believe i could be a son of god i believe i will be a son of god and you'll find that one day that music is distasteful that alcohol is distasteful that lifestyle is distasteful because your body is reacting to a supernatural call not an earthly call and don't confuse this to the works of a a a is good and those things that operate on the principles of a a where they speak these positive things that's good there's tens and thousands probably hundreds of thousands of of people that have been changed by that but i'm talking about my brother and sister the scripture says that we fight not against flesh and blood but against principalities and darkness the spirits of evil and evil kingdom and evil reinforcement of an evil idea you're not just talking about hey we're going to just change people got to be able to withstand the spirits of the day and we understand by the scripture that the spirits of laodicea are the spirits of all the ages have now come into a maturity in this time and my brother and sister many a man many a woman many a family through history has been derailed of the spirit of their day and you're here with a spirit of every age fighting against you why are you standing because there is something supernatural called in you that will lift you up because you recognize on fighting against the flesh and you can fight against your own flesh oh if i could just be if i could do that my father back in the days of korea i say he was blessed in the sense that the the united states navy said we you have an aptitude we're going to make you an airplane mechanic and ultimately they chose to send him to panama where they would fly the patrol planes over the ocean the float planes and because of that he got to fly to many different places my father i'm not speaking ill of this my brother and sister it's not the people but it's a spirit behind it but my father one time was chosen to be the flight engineer to fly to bogota colombia while diplomats were taking care of business and he was there they said now you don't go anywhere stay away from these areas but tour the city be back at a certain time and he got there my brother and sister and come to a catholic church that had multiple layers of stairs going up to the church and those stones were of rough cut rock and here were people who were climbing from one step to the next and as they are praying moving from one step to the next by the time they got a short distance their knees are bloody and they're now leaving a trail of blood behind them believing that is going to save them there's only one blood that would save us and it won't be the shedding of our blood it is his blood and so you see my brother and sister they're acting upon something that they were taught that says if you'll do this you'll find favor with god but my bible says that if we will live this word there's where we find favor with god it's not in our human action but it is obedience to the word of god we find favor with god amen so we could climb those stairs on our knees day after day until we were physically wrecked and couldn't even walk and that would not get us salvation but i tell you we can come and we apply this now i'm talking about how an activist can come and they would give such time and such effort days and nights weeks months and years to do this imagine if they would give that same kind of devotion to the gospel of jesus christ there's where you see a life-changing event taking place we can't change now i'm not going to get into politics but we can't change the politics of our current administration we cannot change the politics of the past administration or those through history my brother and sister one voice will not do that and they believe that multitudes of thousands of people coming together will do that but they burn down a city and say well they're just expressing their voice did it change anything no it sent a signal that evil is good and good is evil reinforcing exactly what the word of god said would happen for our day see when you're called with that supernatural calling my brother and sister it isn't that we give up on life or our nation but we recognize that there's another power uh powers that are battling out uh things that are happening and it comes there my brother and sister and when you're called with that supernatural calling it requires one's entire entire life otherwise we're a wednesday christian and easter christmas this celebration that celebration sometimes to make a fact it sounds like you're being judgmental and i i'm not truly i am not but this last easter there's a certain church down midland boulevard here the police allowed them to put barricades in the streets they allowed them to use the school parking lot because it was just literally packed out very next sunday we're right back to normal i don't want to be that kind of christian i want to have the holy spirit move on my life move on your life something supernatural happened you know that god spoke to you it wasn't some man behind a pulpit you know it was god speak to you and if we're not careful the spirit of the day will bring us back and next sunday we'll be right back where we was i want a life-changing gospel and when i hear a life-changing gospel i want to act upon that life-changing gospel reminds me of a story that was shared it was a first-hand story a personal story a man's grandfather was friends with a man so much so that sometimes he would go and help him work on his project and the man says you know i believe i can i believe i can take this idea that i've got and i believe i can sell it to the car makers and i i believe they'll i think they'll be interested in it but i need 500 more dollars and i i know that you have the 500 would you please invest that with me so i can go forward and he looked at this and he says you know i just don't i don't believe in it i i've helped you i've saw it i've done this but i i don't i just know i'm not going to give you 500 the man found another individual to help with the 500 and he takes his idea i don't remember one of the car manufacturers it was he took the idea to first and they looked at that idea and they said we want in in less than five years that investor who had invested five hundred dollars had made one million dollars and this man says he's i know that story he says because my grandfather if it was great grandfather i'm not certain about that he said everyone in our family and now i've even caught the spirit we lament the fact they didn't see the vision of what the automatic transmission would be you see he had the opportunity to act upon it but in his mind there's just no way they're going to take this little thing because you see the automatic transmission of that day wasn't as it is today it was more of exposed discs and different bands and different things you know so it's very primitive in the sense but my brother and sister those of you that are old enough and maybe brother bob sister joanne might be the only ones that qualify to really have experience back in the day to see cars that had almost prehistoric automatic transmissions but my brother and sister you recognize that there was something there the man was given now my point is is to make to you that the opportunity is given but there's almost more reasons why not sell out to jesus christ well i should the devil comes some of the kids have their little notebooks but i'll just mimic this can i borrow your note sister sue the devil comes and he says but let me show you the reasons why not and he don't just have half a page he just keeps going and going and going he's got all kinds of reasons that's why the new birth is a supernatural event it's not a human event it's not an intellectual event it is not an action i'll go to church today and get the baptism of the holy ghost it is something that has to be in the inside of us inviting us invest invest invest in life here invest in eternal life move forward take claim to this but if we'll listen there'll be a lot of reasons why not well it turns out part of that story was is this uh this grandfather great grandfather whatever called up his father-in-law this is maybe why father-in-law's have a bad reputation i don't know but he called up his father-in-law and he said hey friend and he's got this idea and he needs five hundred dollars and he says you realize son with five hundred dollars you can do this and you can do that and you got a baby coming you can put an addition on your house and fix it all up for that baby and you can listen totally miss the idea that 500 could turn into 1 million but if he had a father-in-law i want to just throw in influence if he'd had a father that said you know what son if i was you you can work overtime you can mow yards you can dig ditch you can trim trees you can do this and make up this 500 dollars but that sounds like a pretty good idea i would risk it and i'll tell you what when the baby comes if this doesn't work out and the baby comes i'll i'll help build a dishing on your house for you for the baby see a different father-in-law different idea different concept different now i'm delving in the natural here but i think you can apply this over into the spiritual some people are like well i have a certain thing in my life brother paul and i struggle with it that's all right praise god anyhow amen you got things in your life that you'd be ashamed for it to become public come to church anyhow amen when you are sitting there don't be ashamed to say lord i behave this way this week lord forgive me amen and act on the word anyhow or we can sit back and say you know when my life is just right all i'll get saved well hallelujah you won't even bother looking at the finish line because you never started are we all right proverbs 16 25 amen this applies to all of us my brother and sister there is a way that seemeth rightened to a man but the end thereof are the ways of death see we can convince ourself right i kind of twist that little deal about being justified we can justify ourself i am justified to treat them like that because they did this to me 42 years ago i'm sorry my brother and sister the bitterness will eat you and they won't even understand why hallelujah well i won't face them or tell them they hurt my feelings because well it might cause a fight okay it might so the answer do you know i have the answer i found it in scripture i go to them they actually hurt me we're talking about not something for thought we're talking about legitimate they hurt me and if i go to them it's just going to cause problems so you know what i'm going to do to solve this i'm going to go apologize to them scriptural i'm going to say i am so sorry that i took what you said and i become bitter over that i couldn't do that brother paul i mean i i would look silly i mean i would well i'll tell you what i won't go into details on this sister jerry and i had a circumstance we went to some individuals and we said we are sorry what are you sorry about what is it you're apologizing you never even told us what the reason is what are you doing god bless you leave i died apart see now it's on them if they had been in the right spirit they'd have said i guess it doesn't really matter what you're apologizing about i accept it see if you come in the truth in this particular situation you come in the truth and you speak out what the actual truth behind it all is if they get that way from an apology imagine what they're going to do when you lay out the facts bent out of shape angry strident over an apology do your part apologize let go of it may not change them but it will change you hallelujah see you're taking action on the word of god now as it is the way that seemeth right to a man but the end thereof are the ways of death you see man's thinking man's approach man's way my brother and sister never ever ever fixes anything but you see god has a way of removing obstacles i'm telling you it's just utterly amazing god has a way of removing obstacles now look partial submission to the word at best gets you partial results come on i want somebody to say amen we need to acknowledge that is the truth a partial submission to the word only at best will give you partial results then people sit there and say well i went to church for 20 years and god never did nothing for me well i'm telling you what folks whoever you might be you never ever gave god yourself a hundred percent you gave god what you wanted to give god you gave it when you wanted to give it you gave it how you wanted to give it and you wanted god to come back and make you a millionaire as it were because of your limited effort hallelujah now look that's a that's a much deeper thing saints than than we would like to look at it's much deeper so if you want complete results you need a complete submission and a complete complete submission brother jason i think you left that spirit up here complete submission to the word brings a complete or fulfilled result see now look at this i i didn't uh i didn't give this to the brothers but it's in the token full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it or added to it but what god said about it you know that didn't solve a lot of problems in christians lives if they just simply looked at the bible and said okay i got no other alternative than to be obedient to this but you know what it is uh one one minister that i know calls it the church of the flavor i feel like shouting i'll go to this church i feel about feel sorry for myself i'll go to this church i want to go to the potluck i'll go to this church i want to do this i go to this church my children need friends i'll go to that church what do they have you realize my brother and sister that every one of these churches has everything that the other church has it's a matter of what they're willing to submit to so when they're not willing to submit to the preaching of the word they're not going to be around for the fellowship do i need to explain it further probably not so you see my brother and sister full obedience to the full word of god and entitles us to the token no other in an age of entitlement my brother and sister no other form will get you the full word of god other than full obedience to the word you know now let's look here real quick hebrews 12th chapter 24-29 and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped who refused him that spake on earth much more shall we not escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth and now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we received a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire now we're looking my brother and sister that a time that i believe that hebrews 12 has come to pass that we are now seeing the shaking of heaven and earth we're now seeing that everything that can be shaken is being removed from the christian's life amen so when the christian life is now changed because things are disappearing is it always comfortable we joked the other day i have a temper because i'm irish go ahead put your weakness in there you might not be irish but you can have something that controls your life that you struggle with and god says no problem going to shake heaven and earth because if it can be removed from your i will remove it because the only thing that will not be moved is the word amen amen i come from this i come from that i this i that god don't care amen god does not care if it's a hindrance i'll just be bold enough to say this i've dealt with people that felt like they had a spiritual plateau over everyone else because they came from a certain church in a certain ministry but the truth of it was they had just as many little foxes in their vineyards as everyone else but in their mind they were more spiritual because of where they come from or what teaching they were under god don't care about that i'm sorry to tell you folks god don't care about that what god cares about as you get that little fox out of your vineyard i have dealt with people that their pastors have actually told them oh god understands don't worry about that little besetting sin come on my brother and sister that's not what this gospel is about it's about shaking those things that need shaken and you know what if you get shook by the word of god maybe we ought to act upon that and go home and get down serious and say lord the word shook something loose there i heard it rattling around lord remove it look we were flying over the bering sea in a uh i don't remember what that was it was a cherokee 310 or something like that or a baron or something i don't remember and i happen to be sitting there right on the on the wing and we're out over the ocean iceberg stuff floating around and i'm thinking you know even if you survived landing in that down there uh there's nowhere to go it's just cold water and ice and i'm looking out and pretty soon something catches my eye and i'm looking out and there's a door on the side of the engine of this airplane and it starts to shake and i lean over to tell jerry there's a door on the side of this engine here that's shaking i look back it's all gone i hope the mechanic that put that on was a little more efficient on everything else put on because my brother and sister i don't care what your looks are if it won't stand if it's shaken it will get tore loose i'm sure it was just a simple thing of a distraction right he put it on there somebody distracted him and never tightened the bolts at least that's what i convinced myself of the pilot said oh no big deal we've lost a lot of them and the pastor who made his church so happy so comfortable feeling so blessed we're all part of this great program will stand one day and say no problem we've lost a lot of them but the one that's lost he's not going to feel that way brother branham says you clench the nail that's why framers don't make good finished carpenters you see my brother and sister wherefore we receiving a kingdom cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear let that be more of the motto of this church let that more be the motto of our lives then i will submit to the shaking see some people never know what will get shook loose because they'll never come they'll never submit themselves to the word of god to be shaken but i say a real son or daughter of god says lord you know what if there's something in my life lord i'm asking you i'm not going to cry when you do it but i'm asking you lord shake that loose in my life because i don't want at the moment of the finish line to realize that i've lost something that i needed because i didn't want god to shake me i didn't want to deal with it now look preachers can get complexes and i i don't mean to really go into this but it's just a fact you know people will be well you're you're too harsh you might wonder once sometimes i ask you guys you know am i okay i'm not offending anybody you know a little complex rises up there i don't want to hurt anybody but you see i realize if i don't tighten the bolts on the cowling on the airplane it's going to fall off and no one's going to go up to the bolt howling of the airplane and say now if i tighten you will you be offended so we're going to take the word and we're going to tighten it down nice and tight amen for we know it will stand the test of time we'll know it will stand the spirit of laodicea we know it will stand whatever might come our way and we won't be offended you see our action my brothers and sisters right here in philippians 3 14 cherry picking this right out of the scriptures but i just want to make this point to you i see it's not we it's not them it's not someone else there's the make-believer spend his whole life going to church hearing the word preached but somehow it never changed never caused him to step beyond the line and look at himself hmm i think i'll leave that one alone you see what happens it comes down to a personal conviction it comes down to a personal action amen an action we're called to but we all have to respond to you know now look at this i want to just really go i've got a lot of highlighting in here and uh separation as it were to bring attention to but we'll just try now see go home read what's in front of it read what's behind it i don't think you'll find that it changes the context reasons no we're this no we're that no i'm sorry i'm a christian christian meaning christ-like that is my goal i don't want to be like a baptist i don't want to be like a methodist amen i don't want to be like lds see these are all things my family touched on in years way gone by my brother and sister i don't want to be like them i want to be like the god who wrote this bible amen i don't want to be because otherwise we'll find ourselves just conforming to a program that says if you believe this you will do this okay that's fine if it's the bible otherwise if it's just a book of creeds now some people think that we're caught up in that but the problem my brother and sister is those people want to take the same brush and paint everyone the same you all believe this so you must think like this well i'm sorry my brother and sister i firmly believe that the covenant the calling says to introduce us to jesus christ i believe it's happened hallelujah didn't introduce us to church introduce us to jesus christ hallelujah so now as then all true believers see him the word of promise of this day openly manifested see this is not just a writing there's not just a theory we're teaching the theory you can take college classes go to bible school go you know to seminary and and they have classes with titles such as the theory of no i want something openly manifested i'm going to stomp on your toes what reaction do i get let's have a line and see no i'm keeping you see my brother and sister we can't judge it that way because you realize there's days that spirits anoint us and we just overreact ah you're not a christian but the word of god says god looks on the heart amen so he looks down in the heart and says boy they had a rough day and the devil really really got them in a corner they kind of accepted they set themselves up for got them in the corner that's not who they are i know who they are because i have a clear vision of their heart amen but i'm telling you consistently year after year after year after year if you don't get rid of that temper something's wrong you don't get rid of that spirit of the world something's wrong right now the devil you know reminds me of a friend this is a couple years ago he said oh yeah you know paul uh i planned it i got got a sweet corn contract an open contract on a really good variety and uh and i said but i thought all your ground was filled up and he goes yeah i'm going to put it right down here by the lake i got a little spot down there and i said well i hope you harvest something and he goes what do you mean i says where there's one there's two and where there's two coons there's three where there's three coons there's four and i kept going until he's finally i got the idea you know his little seed corn plot looked like it had been ravaged by a tornado when it come harvest season my brother and sister did i get that point across where there's one spirit trying to defeat you there's a second and where there's two spirits trying to defeat you there'll be a third it's not just some easy i have a little problem with lying there'll be something else attached to that there'll be something else attached to that something else attached to that the devil where he gets his foot in the door has his minions there to push the door open amen so now the word of promise for this day openly manifested that's a big word if you can get it see manifested i've preached to people who have walked and looked me in the face and say we don't like you using the word manifested no because this message as a son or daughter of christ has to go beyond us just saying i'm a christian it's got to go beyond that it's got to be manifested but if nobody calls you on just the simple fact that you say i'm a christian i'm a believer you can go for years convincing yourself this is what happens my brother and sister to the make believer they're convinced they've got all they need so what we want to see is whether people like it or not we want to see this openly manifested all true believers that's in the word see god openly amen now look at this you cannot say that you are enlightened you know we live in a day with this well they call it woke such a new concept isn't it no no sons and daughters of god have been woke for generations they pick up their bible they read the word of god and it shows them something that other people say nonsense you read it again and say holiness now i don't recommend you do it but i get different ideas and i just have to follow them kind of like a bloodhound or something i guess but you come across articles out in the etherland things like a pastor writing an article saying why we are no longer holiness and he gave a very very balanced very balanced reason as the world has changed we need to be able to interact with them so if we come and our wives look like they're from 200 years ago and we come and we don't understand them how can we interact with them where's that train going hell it's full i guess i should go this bride of christ she's woke i never thought i'd use that term here let me pat myself on the back i'll never speak that word but this bride of christ she's woke amen hallelujah true believer that's in the word see god openly the veil is rent and god stands openly before you just because you say message message message doesn't mean it's open to you or to them or however you want to put it amen so if the veil is rent god stands openly before you manifest it see god didn't leave it as theory to you god left his word as reality it is true we can sit here today and say our god is a prayer answering god he is a healer he is a provider he said he would give me a sound mind and a clean heart at least that's the theory no sorry god stands only before you manifest to see god manifested open in order to do this our old denomination traditional veil must be rent again in order to see what it is you've got to come out from among that stuff see you'll never do it they'll keep pulling that veil before you every time oh there is nothing to that but here it is written and here it is made manifest you see he's used the word manifest a lot here in just this short distance but i don't think that's what he meant because we're going to take seminary 101 theory come on my brother and sister theory never works pardon me for putting it this way but you know i get a few different industry magazines and they're in there and and for the season that's coming there's always articles about you know those things and you know i read these articles and i'm astounded men with masters women with master's degrees phd's etc and they're like if you want to grow good alfalfa you have to harvest it at the right time i don't know who they write the articles to but they're not writing it to somebody who's been raising alfalfa their whole life right and it's dependable different authors same article every year i made a comment to my wife here a while back just waiting for this deal so i can read it so i'll know how to grow hay this year but my brother and sister you look at this see in order to do this our old denominational traditional veil it was already rent it's got to be rent again now you say but we're not in denomination we're not denominational i do embrace this saints let me just share this with you i no longer identify as a non-denominational i actually have a denomination which is something that you adhere to follow the teachings of it's called jesus christ yeah he is my lord he's my savior he's my teacher all good things come from him everything is provided by him that's who i follow that's where i belong you've got to come out from that stuff see you'll never do it they'll keep pulling that veil before you every time now look i i debated and i struggled whether ahead and say these words because in a way it's not applicable to us but i'm just going to go ahead and say it saints there's someone trying to drag that old denominational spirit that old denominational veil they're trying to drag it in front of us they keep saying this is how you got to do it this is how you got to serve god in the auspice of the message this is what you got to do right here and they're pulling in a front but i'm telling you what the word of god says and the prophet of god goes on to say it right here in just a minute is there is a sword called the word the holy spirit that keeps coming and slashing all of these veils that people keep putting up hallelujah yeah you'll never do it they'll keep pulling that veil before you every time oh there is nothing to that but here it is written here it is made manifest you see now what if a fellow refuses to see the sun say oh there i know god said let there be light but there's no such thing i'm going down in the basement i just refuse to see it the guy is crazy there's something wrong with him there's something wrong with a man or a woman can see the promise of god see it manifest and then refuse to believe it because the denomination pulls the veil down see veil now i'll tell you right just i i don't mean to be rude i certainly don't but my brother and sister my bible says get up and go to church my bible doesn't say stay home but there's a whole movement that says don't trust the preacher he'll cause you problems stay home you're better off home than you are in church my bible says go find it my prophet says go find a holy ghost filled church find a good solid pastor amen and if you don't have a good solid pastor search till you find one amen and go to the house of god because it's by the preaching of the word that we are perfected and so it's there we have this great conflict of the day and my heart breaks because i have people that i consider to be dear friends to me would vehemently disagree with me but i'm going to stick with the bible and nowhere in the bible have i found yet i see where he put it in go to church i haven't seen where he said take it out i don't want that to offend anyone on that but you see we're coming down to this little little behaviors little things little things amen and mass refuse to believe because denomination pulls a veil down see veil in order to do this our denomination traditional veils must be broke by god's spirit of fire and sword which is his word okay if it's going to be the word that breaks that then it must be in the word already always his word is his sword see he took his sword for that fire ripped that veil from top to bottom he does the same thing with the same sword today not my creed my book of creeds my catechism but the sword of the lord see rips the veil down you see god standing in plain view manifested in his word what a glorious view to look at see all right god's holy spirit and fire his sword rips it the word rips the denominational veil my that's pretty rough stuff my brother and sister we live in a day that people will almost fight you over that but i'm sorry i'm going to take those same words that said stick with your bible hallelujah aren't you glad there's something that'll come along we get a little veil we get little ideas we little things blurs our vision aren't you glad that sword comes rips that thing opens it wide open we realize just a second okay i wasn't looking at that right because you see every man's right in his own eyes now look we live in a world as i close here we live in a world my brother and sister that the bible spoke of what was going to happen in our day right the bible did we don't have to go on tv we don't have to go on somewhere else and listen to this prophecy and listen to that prophecy now i don't encourage you to do this but i i will be honest and acknowledge you that sometimes as i said in pursuit of ideas i go and study this and so you know i was recently looking there in etherland uh about prophecies and it's interesting what the idea of prophecies are and some people's idea of prophecies uh you know will be like this one man has quite a following not just tremendous following but his prophecy was go ye therefore consuming the word of god overcoming by the fire of god's word it's what we do every day buddy and i'm not making light of this but i'm sorry that's not prophecy in fact looking at you know the behaviors and the attitudes and the whole drama behind it i'm i'm wondering if he's following his own advice my brother and sister the sure word of prophecy in our hour has come in the magnification of the word of god what we need to overcome in this hour is already in this word what we need to do is pray for the revelation that the word would be manifested from us let the word come to life amen i'm not against the spirit of prophecy don't misunderstand me but my brother and sister in an age when satan would take and twist that thing and pervert it and people then follow that oh i've got gotta i've gotta dig into this thing i gotta dig into that thing it's too long a story to really to share but uh we used to rent some farmland from from these people and the missus uh seemed like a very nice lady but um you know we dealt with her where when she bought the land we were already farming it they bought the land we were already farming it then uh we dealt with them for quite a long time just over the telephone and then they moved here and so then i got to meet this lady face to face now my brother and sister how do i say this i enjoyed talking with this lady talk spiritual things one day she says well why don't you meet my family and and pay your rent in person and i said okay i'll do that they lived just a few miles they'd move just a few miles from us i went to their house they opened the door things and and they are coming to pass and therefore they're gathering a following but i want you to find the right words to say this i want you to come and look at this real quick here when prophecies would seemingly be out of season a prophecy would come when there's no other patterns around to fit it it's one thing for me i could go out tomorrow and i could prophesy and say thus saith the lord the day will come when all of these denominations will fall back together because the scripture says their daughters and we can do a spiritual or natural dna and we can test the dna of the daughters and identify the mother would that really be a prophecy i'm prophesying i could be speaking truth thus saith the lord we're going to see the day when the daughters rising up are identified in their mother and everything i'd say would be the truth but you see because we've been made known [Music] can i use it one more time in the service today we're woke [Music] we see what the word says but look at this look at this right here look at the date 19 and 54. right in the era of mccarthyism and all these other things communists we've got to protect against it it seemed totally out of order no great thing but out of order to what what is going on but i want you to look at these words satan might have went out of fashion but he's not out of business he's still on the job brother the thing it is you just let these little old things creep in creep in creep in you think he wanted us to know he's thinking about it creeping in till the devil has blinded the eyes of the american people and communism has swept every church every school and everything else yes sir that's true now you say brother paul what is that well in my digging following it a thought a man you would recognize his name known through politics etc in the united states has a reputation nobody's managed to tarnish it yet and he said i looked at what the variation of communism is and he said i acknowledge it has taken over our government it's taken over our universities it's taken over our high schools he said in fact it has taken over our nation and it struck me i thought my oh my you know the kind of communism he was talking about not a red star in a nuclear device this undermining socialistic we're going to take from the rich and give to the poor but we're not talking about us rich we're talking about those rich and we are also poor so we're going to take from you and give to us and [Music] the whole thing was it [Music] for brezhnev i said we will take over america and never fire a shot my i wonder if he read this quote because that was in the time of kennedy that was shared so this was predates that my point being his saints you take action because the action is taking place the word is here it's opened it's made known it's time for you and i to take a hold of the word say i'm going to live this word i believe this word it is my life it's my identity that's what i'm going to do because you see if you don't the prophecies will still continue to be fulfilled [Music] oh put it all on hold hold hold hold i got one over here that's not doing what they should no no no no these prophecies will still come to pass [Music] scripture says the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous ponder study theorize no sir the righteous run and they don't just run helter skelter they run into it it's time to take action hallelujah god bless you saints i love you my y'all saw how short my notes are that's why you got to be careful when you open a zip file see oftentimes we view all of this as external to ourselves let's see part
