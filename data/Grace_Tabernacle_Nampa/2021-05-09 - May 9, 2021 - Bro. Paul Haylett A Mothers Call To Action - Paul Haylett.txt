know you in truth oh god oh blessed be the name of the lord [Music] hallelujah hallelujah can we say it it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning hallelujah to be a chosen generation a royal priesthood a peculiar people oh my brothers and sisters the world would say that word peculiar might mean weird or strange but the scripture is actually showing us we're different than the world around us oh aren't you glad this morning you're peculiar amen i don't want to be identified with words only amen it's not words only i can say you know it's crazy it's crazy my brother and sister but in the world we live in this might sound i don't mean it to sound humorous i mean it's serious but but people are saying i i i look like this but i identify as that and you realize what that is that is actually in the spiritual realm people saying i identify as a christian but i'm really this here and that spirit come out in the world and now men are saying they're women and women are saying they're men and people are identifying as this and identifying as that and and you see that spirit moves right out and it ripples out into society and we can say we're anything but i want to be a christian i don't want to say i'm a christian i want to be a christian and the word says that we are therefore my brother my sister is within our grasp to claim our inheritance to claim our promise hallelujah well i just want to put this out as a reminder to the church this coming saturday ten o'clock brother yannick sister sharon i'm going to take their final step in their identity as husband and wife and so let's remember as they always say save the date but it's good to save the date but i want you to save the time 10 am and the wedding to start at 10 30. so come let's worship a little let's create an atmosphere in the church this is not a secular wedding we are not bound by a tradition we're christians and christians come to the house of god to worship hallelujah so don't forget that amen and the other thing i was going to share what was that brother jason oh my forgive me my mind is just spinning god bless you mothers happy mother's day each and every one of you our sisters mothers in waiting and mothers that are god bless you each and every one i always am a little bit bad on the tradition i just extend this to every one of my sisters young and old god bless you today amen let's just turn in our bibles this morning god bless you thank you brother jason i i so thoroughly enjoyed our song service this morning it just stirred my heart you know saints i i don't say this anything other than just to explain i don't know a condition you might say sister jerry and i suffered from a condition this morning and it was called worship we're sitting in our bedroom on the side of the bed this morning just crying of the wonderful things amen god has done amen his grace is mercy oh my brother and sister i i i don't know you see it's not something that you can just shake off it just it just lingers with you and you know we we would sing the song which we don't sing too much here in the church definitely did as i was growing up at the end of service almost every service they would sing the song take the name of jesus with you amen it doesn't just leave we walk out the door it's done we left it here it lingers with us and we take that and the presence of god stirs our heart and i just pray today you come hungry i pray today you come with great liberty now those that would understand will understand of what i'm fixing to say there's sometimes things in life god laid upon my heart this sermon and i thought isn't that beautiful and then it dawned on me that mother's day was coming in a couple weeks and i thought i'm going to share this font a mother's call to action today amen but those who will understand will understand that some things are laid upon the heart god speaking preparing laying the groundwork long before the things of life rise up to face us and so i just pray today that each and every one of you just receives the word of god today with an open heart knowing that god loves you and he expresses his love to us through his word amen he comes and he speaks to us through his word and i am a firm believer my brother and sister that this bible this word of god covers every need that we have yes god did not forget one thing that's right god's will is his word second kings the fourth chapter amen let's just move to that brother isaac hallelujah now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead time of grieving for her a time that no one would really desire to face and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor i want to make emphasis the creditor not just any creditor the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be born men and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee now sometimes saints we read the scripture and we just read right on right we just go right through it but elisha asked her a question what shall i do for thee inspiration strikes him tell me a comma denotes a pause more inspiration strikes him what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out unto all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of god and he said go and sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest heavenly father we ask lord for you to come and open the word to us lord just reveal to us the deeper meaning father may it not be superficial may it not just be a story but may we recognize father what we are truly reading today speak to our hearts i pray in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah you may be seated saints you know i've never been much of what you might call a theme preacher you know to preach on things it just always felt like whatever god laid upon our heart would be but this is to me might not be significant to you but one of the rare times that before a season or a time would come and it would come to mother's day that the lord dealt with my heart to to speak upon this subject and it goes much deeper and i cannot explain to you as a body of believers uh the confirmations as it were that god gives to us of what he is leading us to but i want to tell you that god already stirring a heart he comes to meet the need amen and the devil comes pouring in the word of god says god would raise up a standard which we can take this if you would allow me to step out and put this when the devil comes pouring in god has already given his word to counter the devil amen we are not now in the world we live in today if you are a hindsight investor you will never see the true benefits of being the investor it will always be this is worth this i should buy some but by the time the hindsight investor chooses to invest the value or the increase has already taken place and they only get just a small segment of what is there and they're always extremely disappointed and my brother and sister the son or daughter of god that lives in the hindsight of the moving of the spirit of god will always sense a degree of disappointment because the moving of the spirit never seems to strike them fully in measure that's why we should come to the house of god prayed up can someone say amen and we should come hungry therefore we are not a hindsight recipient of the moving of the holy spirit when we come in anticipation when we come recognizing the sign of the time now look it's not a great sign of the time to come to church ready prayed up prophet of god said that should be almost in my interpretation i want to put it that way it should be a mandatory thing as a believer that we come ready to receive from god amen not that we come to church to get rid of the spirits of the workplace get rid of the spirits of the world outside or the spirit that where satan's been fighting you and that's not don't come to get rid of that my brother and sister you've been empowered already to have deliverance from the spirits of this age you come to the house of god to receive the reinforcement of the word that prepares you for your next battle it is not in the hindsight of to deal with what is behind you but god is bringing the word to prepare you for your next battle you see often times we say well i i've been going through it and praise god the preaching of the word the pastor the minister whatever hit on what i was going through see we're behind the circle when we should be in front we come not to play catch up but we come to being reinforced for the next battle so i encourage you dig in dig deep dig down to the rock pitch out all the cans pitch out everything until you are anchored at the rock and then god will reinforce you because god is raising the standard satan will come he will find a standard already prepared oh thank you lord hallelujah you see god did not come to to have us live like most of us live and when i say most my brothers and sister i'm not excluding i'm not standing here as some super spiritual man that woe unto you guys but you know when we do not stay in our proper position we live the life of a yo-yo christian and we don't want to be yo-yos do we amen we don't want to be the up and down the up and down the up and down what we want to do is be prepared and hang on but often times now i was going to touch on that this morning but the lord just kind of led me to leave that out but talking in the revelation of jesus christ uh in the seals there brother branham's talking about how that uh happened to adam was and said he listened to the reasoning that satan had reasoned with eve and adam listened to that and he let go of the word of god to take a holds of that and in that he lost his fellowship and his inheritance my brother and sister we were called to live one our fellowship or to our inheritance we're not called to that this is the age this is the day this is a season that a bride is rising up victorious she is not going to fall again this is not the time the word of god's not talking about a bride our second eve as it were falling again and another raising a resurrection of that this is a season that the bride of christ comes to full fruition there is no avenue there is no foundation laid for something beyond amen either that or we have to go back through to malachi 3 because there's only two anointings of that coming of that calling to anointing so it's either back with john or it's here today well hallelujah i i don't really like the world we live in but i don't know that i want to go back to walking everywhere i go i don't know that i want to go back to that i certainly spiritually don't want to go back to that because you see we have the culmination of the revelation of all the ages and it's been laid out before us today it's right here at our hands what they could only look at in a pre-figure we are seeing with open eyes now look there's many things we do not completely see but we're seeing it unfold right before our eyes today hallelujah amen amen hallelujah you know as a minister sometimes you just don't like it when you get ahead of yourself but as we look i want to make emphasis here that this woman they lived in church they were a part of the ministry they recognized the prophet elisha and the ministry that god had given him and her husband had served in that ministry he had been a part of that and now he has gone from the scene and we see this in the natural that uh she's speaking to him and saying you know what my husband is gone and he served the lord he had a fear for the lord he was faithful in the ministry or the life that he was called to and all of the struggles that would go as she has these sons and now she's having to step into a position that she doesn't really have an answer for and she comes back my brother and sister to the prophet and and she's acknowledging to him the creditor has already showed up at the door he's already notified us that he is coming for a certain debt as it were and uh when i cannot pay that debt the creditor now under the law of the day is able to come and take my sons and take and make them bond men for a season for a certain time it might even be into the jubilee season of seven years uh that it would be that they would be bound by that and my brother and sister she's there she didn't run out and she didn't go try to find someone she didn't go to a title alone she didn't go to here and there she went back to the word of god she said god's got an answer for my situation god's going to answer for the condition that's taking place a circumstance in my household i can't speak to your household i can't speak to your household but i can tell you that god can speak to my household and god will speak to my household and i say with confidence god will speak to your household if you will take whatever your need is that has you bound right that's what a bonds man is he's someone who has found whether it's by oath or documentation or debt or spirit that's right that's right hallelujah there's deliverance the world don't have it that's right and the creditor want to make emphasis the creditor not a creditor the creditor the primary one that is taking and making bond men that's right and let me expand this bond men not of only just young men but of young women also making them abound the creditor and he's come to take unto him my two sons to be born men my brothers and sisters these were believers of the message of the hour this was a prophet on the scene they were believers of the message of the hour can i drive that home to you but that did not exempt them from having their sons taken to be born men to be bound by the spirit of the age that they live in bound by the spirit of laodicea but we are looking my brother and sister of how these scenarios how these things play out because you see it might not even as it were be the children's fault but the creditor doesn't care the creditor doesn't care my brother and sister but let's talk about the family and the personal level oftentimes as parents and i think you parents will be able to say amen we can look back and maybe even your children will throw this back on your face but you've made mistakes and the parents themselves might look in the mirror and say oh god forgive us i wish that i could have done this different and done that different oh lord forgive me i've had a negative influence upon my children i have went into as it were a debt and now the children will be responsible for this debt carried forth you see the husband now in the grave suffers no lingering effect of that debt in the natural but the word says that we will all stand in the judgment and we'll either judge ourself now or we will be judged then sister jerry and i am sorry i don't mean to make emphasis it's just what's on my heart this morning sitting on the side of the bed uh just crying this morning just in the presence of god knowing my brother and sister that we will pay the price hear me well this morning we will pay the price you either get to pay it now or you will pay it later oh god anoint us i pray today that we would pay the price today then we would rise up and say lord i'll give my life today because the word says that you will either give it now or you will give it later that is the problem with the watered down religion of our ages that they seem to have as it is the way they view debt i i can borrow i can spend i can do and there's no consequence i'm here to tell you there's consequence see they were followers of the prophet they weren't some splinter group they weren't somebody looking back they weren't quoting moses that's right she's looking to the prophet of her day now look i'm going to speak kind of blunt is that okay i'm telling you i'm just a few days older than i was when i preached to you last and the older i get the bolder i get and i hope you guys are good with that because i'm i'm looking in the mirror and it scares me where'd that wrinkle come from and where did that saggy spot come from if the lord tarries i've only got so much time to preach the truth to you i want to be a steward of that time you see in a time like this the easiest thing for her to do the easy way out would to have looked her sons in the face and say you know your father got us into that maybe the creditor will let me come and bring you a box of cookies every once in a while maybe i could come and hug your neck maybe i could come wash your clothes but i'm so sorry that you're in this situation see the easiest thing to do is to do nothing and when the holy spirit speaks to you you've got the same decision she had you can take the easy way out do nothing or you can go back to a prophet's words for your day amen and say there is an answer there is liberty i'm going to fight for the liberty come on saints i i'm sorry i would butter you up this morning but but i kind of run out of spiritual butter uh part way through my studies on this sermon and i can't butter you up i just i have to speak to you like it is so the easy way out is to do nothing see you can give up you say you don't know preacher my circumstance that's right i don't know your circumstance but god does and so you can give up to your circumstance and say well there's just no way out of this there's no way and you know what happens some blame it on god some come along and say the situation i'm in is god's fault and they won't serve god for that they'll blame it on something they'll blame it on someone else i had much more strident words in my notes and i felt like i should buttered up and this is what burnt up what butter i have for the whole service and i just started erasing the words that something stirred in my heart and said those are a little harsh i don't mean to be harsh i mean to be truthful and straightforward amen you understand the difference see we can blame it on god we can blame it on the message we can blame it on the church we can blame it on the preacher we can blame it on the circumstance or we can pick up our bible and under the anointing of the holy ghost we can fight for what is ours you realize this mother you didn't see her show up to the prophet carrying some big old shield she wasn't dragging some shield she didn't have some big old sword dragging in the dirt she didn't have shin guards and armed guards and everything and i'm gonna fight for my sons she knew how to fight saints god has opened the word to you and i we know how to fight in this day and the most powerful weapon we have is prayer god help us i think some of us probably need to learn how to fight amen amen whatever you do fight fair right even the scripture did not want the believer to curse satan is this not true now that's not the way of our warfare it's not the way of our nature the word of god is teaching us to be gentlemen and ladies sons and daughters of god amen so if we're gonna fight for one of ours what are we going to do we as sons and daughters of god are going back to the word that's our weapon of warfare my brother and sister is the word of the hour is the weapon that we have been given to fight in the day that we live in and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee you know a lot of people are so quick to be offended that's right a lot of people are so quick to push back in the modern day that we live in this 21st century elisha would have said uh oh what can i do for thee fine i'll just do it myself oh i've seen those reactions the words hardly leave your mouth and they're already angry and they're already walking away but that's not the believer the believer says okay whatever is spoken now remember the prophet of god said you know if you don't have a church to go to you go where they preach where jesus is divine and you take what they say is truth so they read the word of god they read the bible you can say amen to that they say our lord jesus christ is king of king amen might not agree with some of the other but you see you don't go in there and you don't sit down and you don't start criticizing whether they did this and they did that and they don't believe this and they don't believe that oh this place is messed up no wrong attitude wrong spirit hmm amen i don't want to get sidetracked on that what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house you know what this was saints this is discernment god coming right down don't think this is just someone going okay now now let's see what are we gonna what am i gonna say to her oh what do you have in your house maybe you can pawn your furniture maybe you can pawn your jewels you can pawn your dishes you can pawn no sir this is discernment now do we serve a god that's an awesome god we serve a god that can deserve the very hearts of sons and daughters of god it's not just a world out here in the spirits of the world that he's discerning he's discerning our own hearts and the word we'll read in a little bit if we get to it he's reaching right down and we know our own hearts and we say oh the lord's looking at my heart but he knows you greater than you know your own heart he knows what is deep within your heart and he still said my grace is sufficient for thee tell me what house thou in the house discernment now let me just speak this morning i say this in love saints my house included were not exempt but what's in your house tells a lot about where you're at in life that's right come on if our house is filled full of frolic and frivolous our house is filled full of carnalities our house is filled with the superficial that's right it tells a lot on us no one's exempt all worthy things but let's just turn this this morning to the real house that's important on the earth today the real tabernacle of the holy ghost the real dwelling place what is in that house is there anger bitterness strife envy what is in the house saints i think it's time it breaks my heart i'll just be bold and say this it breaks my heart that not more of you show up for a communion because i'll tell you what communion does communion causes you to stop start going through the house it says and let a man examine himself so we start to go through the house and in the atmosphere of communion we start to say you know what lord that is not right it's maybe how i've been for years but it's still not right lord forgive me and god allows you to deal with that now i want to know how many penances and prayers and how many sacrifices you must offer to be forgiven that's right don't be thinking that soon as you get enough good things going for you that it'll be okay examine the house look through the house and what doesn't fit get rid of it and i can assure you that the scripture clearly declares all malice and all strife and all envyings get rid of them clean up the house clean up the house come on saints can i say it again clean up the house it'll make such a difference you say well brother paul i don't know where to start then just start somewhere i think it was brother jason shared with me a book that him and sister emmy read and you know in that this is just one of the things i remember if you're unable to go conquer the big things of your house just start with one drawer and everything that has no value in that one drawer get rid of it did you know saints that while you're still working on your house you can take communion sure am i trying to sell you on it no i'm trying to tell you the prophet of god said this was the word of god one of the ordinances of our day let's not get in a mental conception that we can just skip these things and everything will be all right that's right i don't know where that came from not handmade hath not anything in the house save upon oil see she had nothing of earthly value that she could that she could come and say you know what i i guess i'll go sell this but this little pot of oil i'm telling you my brother and sister oil has always had value so if she had a great big great big jug there she could have taken a portion of that and sold and applied it to the debt but i'm telling you in my heart maybe it's just my imagination but when she says that she just had this little vessel this little pot of oil my brother and sister i'm not imagining that is some great big pot and part of the reason is is here's this little sister now i party me sister nadia but if i come along here with a 55 gallon drum of oil and i tell sister nadia go ahead and pour this out into some other vessels my brother and sister she's not even going to be able to tip it and get it off the floor this is something that our dear little sister was able to pick up and the reason i want to make emphasis of that is we oftentimes say well you know i would get over this if god would just come down in a supernatural way and sweep through my house and just anoint me with the power and i could just go and i could be delivered of this no sir a little pot that a little sister could take and not once enough strength to stagger hold it up and pour it out but something small enough she could pour out again and again and again because in our human element we think i need this vast quantity i need a vast quantity what we need is god on the other side of the vessel we need god on the other side of the vessel and as we pour out he pours in and you can't outpour god you cannot outgive god you cannot out love god you cannot out oh my goodness hallelujah there's just nothing you'll ever do that will outdo god hallelujah including you can't even sin enough to get beyond the grace of god hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister so it's there that she recognizes she has nothing of earthly value but this little pop of oil oh and i'll tell you i don't need to talk to great theologians to get this thought expressed to you the oil has always represented the holy ghost and so in her house she had just this little vessel of the holy ghost in earthen vessels amen so she's acknowledging we have faith in the word of god for our hour we have faith in the things that god has done for us and what he said he will do we have faith in his messenger to the day and that's why we have come to elisha because we believe he's a man of god we believe this is the word of god for our day and we have confidence in that amen hallelujah and so there it is he tells her what i want you to do go and borrow vessels now i hope you can follow the spiritual type here my brother and sister i want you to go borrow vessels it's not about how many but you see god was going to come and prove you know the whole spirit of this abundance gospel you know this prosperity gospel you know it has roots right in the bible where everybody's like god wants to bless you beyond measure god wants to just give you more than you could ever contain that's right he want to fill you with the holy ghost so full that you can't contain it he never said nothing about mansions and mercedes and swimming pools and jet planes he's talking about filling you up with the holy ghost you got a choice between more of the holy ghost and more of the things of this world i pray god would just anoint you to say i want the holy ghost more than i want anything this world has to offer but i'm telling you what you see it time after time affluence comes and the barriers start to come down and that's why the scripture says that very few rich men that's right we'll make it amen because very few are able to withstand the onslaught of the spirit of the almighty dollar but lord if i just had a little more money we just had a little nicer car like maybe the nicest one in the church and lord if we just had a little bigger house like the biggest one in the church lord we would entertain we would do this we would do that would we i can assure you from personal experience the more you have the more it takes to take care of it it's almost like a curse you know that sister jerry i'll just i just feel transparent this morning hopefully you can look right through me and see the cross here this morning you see being motivated or driven as the world would use that term can be just as much of a curse as it is a blessing all right think about it now look are we okay okay you see she trusted she went and borrowed all these vessels see it doesn't say in there that she actually did this but we recognize she's a true believer so the question marks not whether she was going to do it or not she's a believer believer follows the word so it's just automatic they don't have to put in there and she went from this house to this house to this house she went to 124 gram street 126 elm street and 128 elm street and then all the odd numbers don't have to say that the prophet said it are you with me prophet said it yeah she had confidence in the words of the prophet she went and did it no need to document every last little thing about she did this and she did that they did this they did that right amen oh i tell you what this is where it gets really good and when thou art come in i shall shut the door upon being upon thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shall set aside that which is half full that which has been anointed not which has seen the oil no sir set aside that which is full how many vessels do you fill up a thousand how many did you fill up 200 how full was yours i just poured a drop in each one it didn't fulfill the word look the prophet's words were you pour that vessel full preachers are we listening we're not here to just get as many half full vessels as we can packed in the walls of this church what we're looking for is to fulfill the word of god and to every vessel be filled completely and set aside you wonder my brother and sister i try really hard in fact maybe i try too hard to not stick my nose into your lives not to just do sometimes i bite my tongue and i just pray that god would change circumstances because my brother and sister it is a human element to want to go fix things not everybody's that way but i am a fixer i am one that in the the human element i would like to just come and i would like to just fix it for you but my brother and sister it isn't how it works you have got to be the vessel you have got to be the one that's clean on the outside clean on the inside you've got to be the one that says nope i'm not full yet pastor preacher keep pouring holy ghost keep pouring i'm not full yet i want more of you lord keep pouring but if we're satisfied with just a little bit i can tell you the season will come will you be right back where you started with not enough oil right now for sake of time this morning i kind of admitted it but i will verbally just lay this out when the wise and foolish virgin were there and the call came out behold the bridegroom cometh what was the only ingredient does a scripture use to define those who stayed and those who went oil that's right didn't talk about their house didn't talk about their bank account didn't talk about their intelligence level didn't talk about their clothes or their only the oil that's right god fill us all i can say this morning i set my office and i wept god fill us don't let us walk out lord with just a little bit lord let us sit here before the throne until we are full you see this little mama didn't set you in the world and the door is closed and what happens then they had a revival amen they had a little revival in that house and as they were having a revival they saw the word of god coming to pass in their house they weren't having to sit over here and say well i can look over here at this family god's really answering their prayers i can look at this family god's really answering prayer i can look at this preacher over here god's really answering prayer i'll tell you why you feel like god's not answering your prayer you haven't shut the door to the world and you haven't poured out and you haven't filled up and you have just settled for whatever will be will be the future's not ours to see yeah i'll tell you what my future is clear before me can someone say amen this morning my future is clear before me the word of god said i am victorious in every trial i'm an overcomer no matter my circumstance oh no matter what satan would do i can stand up and say i am chosen i am a chosen generation i am a royal priesthood i'm not some common person on the face of the earth god chose me before the foundation and placed me not in any age but this age why because in gross darkness the light has to shine and you ought to say thank you lord for letting me be the light of laodicea let me be father the light of laodicea it's not a curse that you're in this day is a blessing it's an anointing from almighty god showing his favor to you his confidence to you he trusted you empowered he called you to fulfill this scripture says this comes to my mind the scripture says you did run well who not what who did hinder you amen problem is saints can i just speak a little blunt i've been speaking politely in case you didn't know you know reminds me one time is there at the farm shop salesman pulls up gets out comes in the shop i wouldn't say he was necessarily a younger man but maybe in his mid-thirties starts off to tell me how long been with this company how long he's been selling this project this product i mean how successful he's been and then he takes a step forward and he says i'm not leaving here today until i sell you something and i was like well i guess we could invite you to supper and maybe we could get you a blanket on the porch but you know the problem is many of you think that many of us are here to sell you something just a few days ago not making light of people's bodies but this car pulls up in front of the shop this little man gets out and i'm sorry lord forgive me for thoughts like this but i thought my goodness that man's as white as he is tall and he come into the shop with a brochure some paperwork he walks right in hi my name's roy and i represent this company and if there is anything i can do for you i will do it broiler see what you got my a man who would come with that attitude i might not be able to sell you something but i might be able to help you i wanted to ask him if he was a preacher but after a few minutes it was obvious he wasn't i felt sorry for the man my heart breaks don't don't think i'm making light of him but the obvious thing was he was telling me how his wife had got sick she passed away he was heartbroken it was four years ago my first girlfriend was like this and my second girlfriend was like this and my third one was like this the lady i'm living with now is like this he's not a preacher but you see my brother and sister it's all about the attitude the first man now let me balance this for you the first man i didn't have the right attitude towards him but neither did he have the right attitude towards me he saw me as a way to make money and the minute he said those words i saw him as an adversary now let me bring that to church can we bring him to church yes many times the preacher says something maybe he says it too strident maybe he says it too blunt or it seems like without love and instead of saying what he's saying is true we you're not selling me anything we walk out of church with nothing and he walks out of church wondering why nobody cared but the truth is is there got to be a melding together the truth the scripture says in love and sons and daughters of god want truth so when you have the truth in love and truth is presented we both walk out blessed see there's there's the structure that god wants you see because if you think that the ministry is against you then we are in a self-destructive cycle the preacher walks away and says why do i do this i don't care you walk away going why is he trying to tell me to clean my house he don't know what my house is like he doesn't know nothing about my house well then haylets i'm sorry to tell you a little transparent sister jerry had a little company yesterday and i'm like uh you didn't show them the house did you yes i did i'm like oh mercy that's my dirty socks on the floor that's my sweatpants and my t-shirt tossed in the corner that's pants i wore about a week ago still laying there on the floor because i told jerry i'll take care of them so what happens when she hears a prophet's words she proceeds to get the vessels she doesn't have to stop and figure out how far this oil will go she has no clue i'm going to take a position that she was just as smart or smarter than any of us she didn't stop there and say now i've got a reason this i don't know why he wants me to get all these vessels because there's only maybe a half a gallon of oil here and so what's this going to do what did she do she simply took the word of the prophet god's word spoken to her she didn't have to figure out a formula and figure out how this by this and done by this and this way in that way can produce this she just said he said it amen he said it i believe it was thus saith the lord he said it and so i am going to just go and she fills the house imagine i can see the whole house every room everything just filled full of a vessel stocked up and then they closed the door and they had a revival in the house i think more of us need a revival in our house we can start pouring out some oil if we close the doors and have the revival amen and so starts pouring that oil out and as she's doing that oh get this saints she drew by the word of the prophet she drew her children into the experience it wasn't mama it wasn't mama's experience a problem some of us got it's a daddy experience it's a mama experience good or bad oh it's about this and it's about that no no she had revelation she drew her children into the experience and her children were there they weren't off in the room sorry i hope don't meet i don't mean to insult any of you they weren't off in the room on their ipad they weren't in there on their smartphone they weren't in there on their cable tv they weren't in there in their sports magazines they were in there watching their mama pour the oil out again and again and again and again and mama poured the oil out on sunday and mama poured the oil out on monday and mama poured the oil out on tuesday and mama poured the oil out on wednesday and mama poured it out on thursday and on friday and watched their house transformed and it wasn't just that mama could pay a bill but that act of a prophet and that act of a god-fearing believing mother give those children deliverance from the bond men it was what delivered their children from rock and roll is what delivered them from meth and from the music and from the clothing and the spirit of the age it was that continual poor real simple thought she could have been there reasoning this out each vessel we owe 100 remember this a long time ago 100 at five dollars a vessel we got to fill up 20 of them one two three four five 18 19 20. praise the lord we're done what'd you do she listened to the intricate detail of the prophets when he said as many vessels as you can get and you keep pouring until they're all full when the deepest regret i have as a young man there wasn't much oil poured by my children my children's father i mean to say their mother was pouring oil their mother stood and looked me in the face and said paul whatever you choose to do i'm going to church anyhow come on saints i'm not just talking to you out of thin air here i'm telling you there comes a time there comes a place that you got to put your complex to the side you got to put your feelings to the side you got to put the circumstances of your life well if you knew how i was raised in the circumstances no put it aside put it aside she didn't offer excuses to the prophet she went and did what he told her to do what was it a mother called action amen and she obeyed the call amen right look how simple this is well you know brother paul no no mamas future mamas sisters young and old just respond with action amen not with excuses not with reasons not with circumstances action start borrowing the vessels and start pouring it out now you tell me coming right back to the little sister fed a prophet he says i don't care that you only got enough food for one meal you fix it for me first you know what the type is i remember reading this deal online where some guy with a theological whatever and phd this and phlll and whatever and the guy's like it wasn't reasonable for elijah to ask her that okay so it's not reasonable it's not reasonable but they missed the revelation that it wasn't elijah standing there it was god in elijah's flesh and god was speaking to that widow woman saying put me first you put me first and i will take care of you but you see looking at from the carnal side it just isn't reasonable that man was i forget had some term you know when preachers start promoting feminism yeah he should have cared about her he should have understand her needs he did he did put god first and god will take care of you there's your need there's the revelation that you need put god first clean out the house [Music] oh hallelujah that's right now look here what the prophet's words are i got to get going along my where's the time go she had this revival in her house and it comes to pass when the vessels were full you know what it was she didn't stop saints i want to just drive this home to you we get these cars we get these things well i i've heard message believers saying well you know my my children they're going haywire but what do i expect i went haywire when i was their age yeah i understand i understand i understand you left the door open you only borrowed a few vessels and before the spirit was finished being poured out you had had enough and you put it down and you wonder why your children are mimicking your behavior instead of a godly behavior because you didn't listen to the prophet you didn't get all the vessels you could and you didn't keep pouring when you had opportunity yeah i understand but you know what scares me the most about that saying sorry if i'm being blunt i'm stepping on somebody's toes i don't mean to god laid this on my heart it's been on there for long enough to become a burden you know what the problem is what we think is love to our children is selfishness to ourselves amen oh yeah glad i don't have my wallet because the only thing i have my wallet is 100 bill i don't want to give that away but you know our solution is sister gabriella will you be my example i hope she just cringed she's my adopted granddaughter so i can kind of mistreat her and it'll be all right but i'm not you know what the problem is we see a little something oh sweetheart here daddy loves you grandpa loves you we walk away going oh i did something for my daughter i did something for my granddaughter it was selfish you weren't willing to get the vessels you weren't willing to close the door and you weren't willing to pour out whether you felt like it or not you have actually just given a carnal solution to a spiritual problem that's right tell me that's not selfish on the part of the giver 100 bill will just buy your love my daughter my granddaughter loves me she will until some punk out here starts buttering her up with the caramel butter and tells her oh your parents they don't really love you they don't really love you look if they loved you they let you do anything you wanted climb out your bedroom window and go with me and i'll sell you to some guy in new jersey and they'll never see you again see how the devil plays the game and the parents are like oh we love our daughters so much we love our granddaughters so much oh why why why no you didn't love her no you didn't love her because if you loved her you would have closed the door to the world and you'd have started pouring out the oil and you'd have kept pouring the oil until you could have looked over there one day and say my dear little daughter granddaughter is clear full of the spirit of god she's got the holy ghost she's been delivered she's been sealed to the day of her redemption that's love my brother and sister but it takes effort on the side of daddy and mama to express that kind of love amen and it takes effort on the side of a ministry ministries in a church in a body of believers to pour out that kind of love it takes prayers in the middle of the night it pray it takes praying god what do they need to hear it takes time it takes effort not selfish come on so what happens here finally reaches the point there's nothing left to be filled there's just nowhere to go then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil now i want you to understand my brother and sister i preached it in this church many times i'll preach it to you again holy ghost to a christian is like gasoline to a car you walk out of here today some of you will go home and the devil will be waiting on your doorstep in fact you know you pick the lock to your house he might be sitting on your couch right now waiting for you because he's going to prove to you you ain't got any oil on your vessel but it takes oil just to live in this day praise the lord we've filled everything up no see the type right here in scripture go sell the oil holy ghost which is god himself paid the debt you see what it is right here god himself poured himself out and paid our debt all he wants us to do is be a part of the active plan of god he wants you to put the effort to pick that up as it were and take it out and maybe take it to an altar and say you know what i've been bitter about this person i i've had this or i've had that i've had an anxiety i've had a fear i've had what you just name it and you've got to take that oil and you've got to go quench that debt well isn't god going to do it for us no sir she had to pour the oil out she was entirely there was no knock yes elisha sent me to pour the oil out for you no no you've got to close the door you've got to have the vessel you've got to pour the oil amen that seems like that'd be enough but no see what god's got to do is get you to get down to the reality of this and now you have to take the holy ghost and you have to examine yourself amen and that will cause you to start pouring some oil out here and here you know i said this i thought this i felt this forgive me whoa whoa that's too big a price i'm too proud to do that okay okay no problem i can show you where the prophet of god says when the holy ghost comes upon a man it humbles him not a proud bone left in his body that's right or you can stand up and say i've been wrong forgive me amen i just can't do that you're not ready that's right you're not ready probably your back door is open go check and see you probably left the garage door open there's got to be a door open somewhere because when the door is closed and god's on the inside amen things change amen amen amen that's right man this is a terrible mother's day sermon isn't this i'll tell you what reminds me that little story we're sitting there on the bed this morning on the side of the bed and we're talking about this reminds me a little story about that girl coming home from college with her friend she's ashamed of her mother what was it like the conductor or somebody there you know it's like how dare you treat your mother like that when the house was on fire and you were a little baby in that room she ran in there not to save herself oh come on moments are you with me this morning didn't even put that effort out to save yourself but you put that effort out to save your baby hallelujah you're pouring the oil out god's been good to us as adults we're sitting here god's been good to us are we too lazy too selfish to pour the oil out for our children that's it oh hallelujah some of you look pretty somber this morning are you frowning you're sad or are you thinking somebody please send me a memo but the truth is we've got to break our selfish spirit amen and realize if we as a church are not willing to pour the oil out for our children god will find someone who will i'd like to know that i had an impact on my children's life i know i did when i was backslidden it was i had a giant you know slash line negative now by god's grace maybe i can have an impact with the plus sign amen not all negative okay let's move on to the second half of the sermon here i say that jokingly but it's kind of true you know what god help us apply a liberal you know did you guys know i i might ought to tell you you thought i was conservative this whole time but i'm actually liberal i want the liberal presence of god nothing not the stinging not the conservative side i want a liberal dose of the holy ghost i want a liberal power of god moving in our midst amen not conservative we're all so conservative in our politics we bring it to church and it's like no no no we can't do that that would seem liberal if i was to stand up and shout hallelujah if i was to hauler if i was to oh my i just remember i just remember a service we had i don't remember who was preaching might have been brother dwayne lawson might have been brother andrew my brother david i'm not here to embarrass him but i'm just going to tell you my brother david got so anointing he's here in the aisle and he's just standing here and he's just doing and i'm sitting here looking in most of his eyeballs it's about this big and you're just like oh my goodness what is god holds a brother david what's he doing come on i want a liberal dose that's right because i tell you don't take very much anointing to get an amen out of you that's right but i tell you what to get a game changer out of you it can take quite a bit hallelujah well look i see it saints look i say this in humor i see this oh let's stand and praise the lord and it's like oh he asked us to stand up come on come on somebody smile now look at this what is going to activate this first john 3 21. i'm telling you this is drug out so far i am sorry beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god you see you don't see one sign in this scripture of dealing there that she was hesitant to follow a prophet's words her heart had no condemnation she had confidence to god and she knew that what she was doing was for the benefit of her children and my brother and sister our children will see us fuss they will see us fight they will see the dark side of our marriage they will see every circumstance that we would like to hide from them but shame on you for hiding what is happening in your world shame on you for putting up a false front of what is going on we are and i don't say this to offend no one and like i've said before the service this has been on my heart for for just a period of time here but my brother and sister it's not for us to hide these things in our life it's for us to find deliverance from these things in our life we have a tendency of we're gonna fight in the backyard well i'll tell you the prophet of god said that i'm not going to counter that but how about we come to the place where the spirit of unity brings us to the place we're not fighting in the front yard backyard side yard or whatever my brother and sister that we can stand in the word of god hallelujah because you see what happens satan wants to come along and he wants to put this little that's it you know we're driving to church i'm not applying this to no one don't misunderstand me driving to church me and the husband just gotten a little tiff i really can't say amen to what the pastor is saying he do he just sewed a little condemnation oh maybe i'll go somewhere we don't like to go as message believers i was driving to church and there was a pretty woman on the sidewalk and i looked at her twice i feel so condemned there's just no way i can enter into the service now satan spreading a little condemnation i laughed at a joke that most believers would call dirty there's no way i could respond to the word of god and satan's going through there i wore clothes that i knew i should have threw out of my closet a long time ago and i don't know why i wore that little condemnation thrown out there and he just moves in our midst and we get to church and we're trying to praise god and we're asking for him to move but our hearts down there saying how can you do this don't you remember don't you remember don't you remember scripture says that we're not warring against flesh and but against principalities and powers of darkness i'll tell you how transparent i'm going to be this is going to be an owie but i just want you to understand i'm willing to preach what god lays on my heart sister jerry and i drive into church on wednesday night fighting like cats and dogs because that was probably a little too aggressive disagreeing over something so important that it will have no impact on our lives ever can someone say amen you know what it is even as we're driving along arguing sister jerry looks at me and goes why are we doing this because i want to now you can have a little sympathy for brother paul and sister jerry because wednesday night brother david drugged me out of my seat right over there i know those of you who are here in church and those that you watched it didn't see this but this is what happened he drug me out of my seat right up here to the center of the church and proceeded to stomp on me but it was in love and i'm quite certain we're not the only ones that those things happen to now i have a choice you have a choice you can look at the minister and say how dare him or you can look up and say thank you lord thank you lord i've got some oil oh come on saint i hope you see this thank you lord i've got some oil i can pour out i can pour this oil out and say forgive me lord thank you lord i want to pay this little debt of this spirit that got on me that caused me to do this hear it and cover it with the holy spirit pretty soon nobody's good enough to go to church with me but problem is the guy sitting next to you feels the same way about you and pretty soon the church just dies withers becomes cold and formal look now those of you that were going to go to a restaurant for mother's day actually i'm doing you a favor because the people will have all eaten and gone home by the time you get there but you see god's bringing us to a consciousness my brother and sister to a constant state to recognize who we are and what's happening around us right see because remind you once again we're not dealing with flesh and blood we're dealing with principalities and powers that would desire to come down into a household desire to come down into our car come down wherever and stir it up stuff that's underneath the blood we will be bold enough to walk under the blood and drag that back out and say there you go you did this you said this you whatever this my brother and sister that's how strong those anointings are but any son or daughter of god that examines his life would say you know what it's only by the grace of god that i myself can stand and praise god lift my hands in worship only by the grace of god i'm able to do that does that mean we shove it under the rug reminds me of a cartoon it was on a little preacher's website you'll never find it that's good but it shows this three or four stage cartoon and it's obvious it's a preacher he's standing on the step with his bible and the wife looks out the window oh my goodness honey it's preacher jones and they look at each other what are we gonna do you lift up the rug and i'll start sweeping everything underneath it i'm sure that solved all the problems didn't it but the last frame of the cartoon shows the preacher standing inside their door on this big lump in the carpet and he says what's wrong here come on examine yourself deal with it clean your house out of course if you left the back door of the house open maybe instead under the rug while someone delays the preacher at the front door you can sweep all your problems out the back door okay other half of the sermon are we okay a few more minutes now remember this now look there is all of these keys that one unlocks another unlocks another that's how revelation works right we don't just unlock something and we have revelation sometimes we have to see one portion see that's what the oil is doing to us saints now look at this brother trevor hope you don't mind brother trevor and i've been good friends for a number of years now and we have at times disagreed with one another and we've been upset with one another and we have been vocal about him we brother trevor nothing to be ashamed of we didn't throw things we didn't call each other names we just disagree now my brother and sister in a case like that if we have a key that's been given to us the key was i gave to brother trevor and said if you'll unlock this you'll see i'm right no sir the same key that god gave to brother trevor he gave to paul and we find ourselves standing at the same door unlocking and stepping through into in this case we're talking a deeper relationship a deeper friendship deeper fellowship it doesn't end right there though god gives us another key and we unlock the door and we step in a little deeper you see that's how friendship is made that's how we have confidence when someone says well you said this and i didn't understand you don't get offensive that's right you know what do you mean you didn't like what i preached no i didn't understand what you said or vice versa you ought to hear brother trevor when he starts talking about certain topics we were sitting i remember whose house that was one night and i'm like is this the brother trevor i know i was talking about this adam thing this and this did this and that come around like this and this was like that and i'm like look i think i understand what you're saying brother trevor you're saying that if we plant a good seed in dirt and water it that it'll grow is that what that was is that what you were saying but you see god's bringing this bride down to one mind now look at this remember this christ in the true church what did he do we had to all be given the same key to get into church come on we're not in a different building we're not in a different church as it were right we've been given the same key to get into the same church christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts we've read this quote so many times we should be able to just quote it right amen but look at this now it's a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works now look at this saints what we're talking about here this moving of the holy spirit this oil to pour out is exposing satan and so we have here i mean anybody that's been married more than i don't know how long has most honeymoons last 50 years okay so so i think i'm gonna come move into your house and see how it's done because our honeymoon lasted about three days i went back to work [Laughter] man you've had it good brother david now look at this what is happening is is satan's coming he's the creditor and he's coming in here and he's trying to take what he says he has claimed to so the book of acts my brother and sister was not an event that's right it was an experience that's right that's where people get it so wrong so what is brother brown saying here i'm not changing his words don't accuse me of changing the prophet's words i'm going to say what he said but i want you to understand what he meant christ in the true body of believers is a continuation of the acts of those true believers the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into church amen and defile it he didn't come to church to worship he can't worship the prophet of god says that if the devil come and he got under the blood and he wouldn't have the experience he'd be your brother so he's not even here to take part of the experience in other words he doesn't care whether he's got oil to pour out or not he got anointed with that oil at one time he got a little oil on him got just a little oil in his vessel and he's good with that making it lukewarm saints that's why i'm not here to punish you i'm not here to drag services out i don't measure service by length but there's just so much to say making it lukewarm you know why i fight against the formal side here saints i encourage you someone say amen someone respond somebody please lift in somebody please smile because you see the spirit of formality doesn't just jump on a church pardon me for putting it this way it starts on this row and it silences them and then it moves to this realm and it silences them until pretty soon no one wants to speak up no one acknowledges how great yes my god amen amen and when it becomes lukewarm it becomes formal then it becomes powerless you say brother paul where are you going with this i'm telling you there was a sister and when a prophet told her you go home and you take that oil and you start pouring it out i'm just gonna kind of go beyond what i said earlier maybe the jug was bigger than paul thinks it is and then say get your son to pour it out mama god started with you pouring it out maybe she needed to pray through lord give me strength to lift this jug up but it didn't matter powerless it exposes satan you want to know what's happening my brother and sister now look i know none of you ever fuss and fight with each other it's just sister jerry and i on the way to church because i didn't see anybody jump up and say amen but um you know you know what satan's doing he's coming in and we're looking for some greater sign we're looking for something but just like the holy spirit moves in our midst it's a spirit the devil moves in you thought you heard a click that was him closing the back door he wants to be inside he wants to convince you that's fanaticism don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it it won't make any difference and besides that you're fighting with your husband on the way to church you have no right to do it sorry under the blood i took the oil i poured it and covered that see what's happening saints satan's getting exposed now you you you might be ashamed and say you know what we're fussing and we're fighting and i i just have condom no no no no no no stop stop stop stop sometimes god lets that happen to expose the devil so that you start to recognize how the devil's tactics work and his spirit and the work that he's doing you recognize it you can say that spirit i i experienced it before i recognize that spirit i'm not going back there i'm not going back there and reveals his works now look at this see what brother branham tied with this you say well brother paul what do you mean what is this about how is this look what it's all about i believe god anointed the prophet to put this into words here it exposes satan revealing his works what is his works attempted destruction of you and discrediting of the word that's that's what he's doing you you you say well no no that was god that was god that let you that was god you say it was the devil no my brother and sister the devil can't do anything but what god allows him to do it god sometimes will let you fall down so that you can recognize i don't belong here this is not who i am and when you start to come to that and the next time the devil comes that way you're like no he's trying to destroy me i'm not going to live with condemnation i am called to liberty i am called to the freedom of the moving of the holy spirit i will not be bound by these spirits and then you start to push back against them amen right down to the time he's passing the lake of fire he fights that what is it not flesh and blood this is the fight of principalities and powers of darkness this is the devil my brother and sister it might be easier if the devil just come and just took a sword and cut you we'd say wow look what he just did to me but look how the devil can come and take the sword now understand what i'm saying the sword of the spirit and he can come right down and he can cut a little here and cut a little there and pretty soon little spirits pop up my husband doesn't love me i don't know if i was called to be a believer my wife my children the devils there are cut here and a cut there and a cut there what is it he's destroying you did you know in the days when they fought with the rapier they didn't try to drive the rapier is a very thin very flexible blade they weren't trying in those days to drive that through a man's armor into his heart but then cut him on the wrist cut him on the side of the face cut him in the side here cut him on the calf of the leg and pretty soon from the i hope you get this from the loss of the blood when we finally come to the place we step away from the blood we die we lay down and fight no more amen see that's what satan's doing right he fights that he can't stand it he knows that if you are you with me he knows that if you get the true revelation of the true church and what you is i know that's not good english and what you stand for and what you can do the greater works you can do the greater works are you with me i know i'm changing these words but don't make this impersonal don't make it just a quote i read make this realize this is the warfare that you are in it is not flesh and blood it is not the wife it is not the husband it is not the parents it is not the children it is not the preacher it's the devil because you see every time he gets you to the place that your confidence in god is waning he's winning that's what he's trying to do he's fighting you see my brother and sister when you are kept from the greater work mama i just told you this morning of a story of the bible of a mother that did the greater work it wasn't like we think she didn't go out there and tell that creditor you're a lion cheating deceiving devil she didn't go stand on a corner and say this is false this is false that is false what'd she do she closed the doors to the house and she started pouring out the spirit of god into the house oh man mistakes my children wouldn't believe me no i'm here to tell you that's the devil it's called condemnation we think kids if they hear those voices 11 45 at night they're not in there going oh mom and dad are praising the lord you're not fooling them you're fooling yourself you see all he's trying to do is keep you from doing the greater work you say but i got discouraged and i walked away from church i got discouraged my family has walked away from church we're discouraged that's all right you're all right you might think everybody's going to look at you like a sinner i'll tell you what you do you turn right back and come back to the word you don't have to come to this church you don't have to call me your pastor none of that is important you've got to get back to the word of god you've got to get back to that oil you've got to get back to that position right there see but what he's trying to do is convince her what she's standing for is not right and convince her she can't do the greater work but when god comes down and the oil is poured out without hindrance you wake up oh i hope saints that you can say amen to this you wake up in the morning and you're like thank you lord that i'm a son of god thank you lord i'm a daughter of god none of yesterday none of last week last month last year has anything to do you recognize who you are right now there's the time grasp the moment take the word examine the house cast out everything that doesn't fit doesn't apply let the oil flow right amen hallelujah i think i've wore my thought out well who wants to sister emmy would you come who wants to be an invincible army you know revelation comes in many forms my brother and sister we have revelation understand the bible we have revelation to understand the spiritual world we have revelation understand the natural and if we'll have an understanding now catch this we'll have an understanding of the spirits that are moving in this present world that's a revelation we need we often times yes sir i got a revelation i do this you know it's interesting i just love the statement that brother david made the other day the seventh seal is not a doctor the revelation of jesus christ is not a doctrine it's an experience hallelujah and if that is closed we got some serious problems that means nobody has got a relationship with god so when you understand the spirits moving in this present world and you understand that the creditor is still on the job amen but i want you to remember most of all the oil is still being poured out hurt not the oil and the wine holy spirit's still pouring out don't let the devil tell you it's somebody else it's you saints it's you this invincible army this true church it's not someone else it's you it's you take a hold of that if you find yourself oh hallelujah sorry i don't know if this offends someone forgive me but if you find yourself in a constant battle with someone they're just this they're just that they want this they want that they do this they do that i just ask you as your friend your brother will you stop [Music] close the doors of your house leave the husband outside leave the wife outside leave the kids outside leave the parents outside close the doors of your house and get to the place that the oil flows freely you know always marvel this is kind of a little humorous in a way evangelists come to a church preach some tremendous services there was a lady in the church she was considered the church information center you know what that translates into in english don't you she was the gossip god strikes her heart during that saturday night meeting and the evangelist tells him god's dealt with you you go home and don't quit praying until you prayed through good sound advice she come back to church sunday morning [Music] and she's there in church worshiping the lord tears that she hadn't cried in years flowing down her cheeks and she looks over at old mrs widow jones and goes oh praise god the lord just sure changed sister jonas [Music] and when we come in the presence of the outpouring of the oil why suddenly everyone around us is going to look a lot better so much more to say things [Music] let's see let's go back to his quote real quick exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting god's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire he don't quit we got people that are just like i don't know if i'm going to go and serve god or not all right well the devil ain't going to quit at least you can mimic the devil he fights that he can't stand it now look at this oh here's i knew i had it in here ephesians 6 10 14 finally brother be tossed around in the lord and in your weakness no no no that's the devil's interpretation finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his mind put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil he's tricky come on pardon me i'm not trying to imply nothing but he's tricky he knows how you know we get in the car to go to church and he don't just stand on the curb and say i hope they invite me i hope they invite me no sir he goes right over there and he just jumps right in seat belt he doesn't want you to know he's in the car because the seat belt bites going to ding his seatbelt on he settles down he's comfortable [Laughter] you're driving aggressive no i'm not yes you are when i drive like that you you get upset with me i don't think i'm driving aggressive you're speeding i'm going 45 and a half miles an hour you should take a different route to church those are not the shoes i put out for you well that's nothing i didn't realize i was in the car that the tie that i'm wearing doesn't match either oh god bless you guys we're so happy to be in church today praise the lord we're looking for a great moving of the holy spirit today as soon as i can cast this spirit off i'll be able to receive something from the lord unfortunately it took all but three minutes of the church service to cast that other spirit off he's widely isn't he he's willing i've listened to believers fight over whether or not the wife put pepper scalloped potatoes you tell me the devil's not wiley i'm not talking about just like i think you put pepper in this no i didn't honey it's like i told you not to put pepper in these i didn't yes you did you kept telling me my taste buds don't know what to talk about is this like 46 minutes after church come on he's wily he's wily and the whole time he's trying to diminish everyone's value oh you say no no they were speaking to me in such a fashion my value is diminished no no the speaker's value is also declining [Music] let's catch a revelation today can we catch a revelation who will lift a hand and say lord let me catch a revelation today hallelujah or we let's read this together for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let that be a revelation to us saints we're not wrestling husband to wife wife to husband children and parents we're not wrestling against brother or sister we're wrestling against spirits that are anointing you wrestling against spirits that want to get in the car with you get in the house with you go to church with you when we catch a revelation that that is not the holy spirit then let's close the doors let's get the vessels let's start pouring out the oil because we certainly must be low on oil oh hallelujah i hope this don't come down as congregationally today i love you i love you you see he says that if the people get the true revelation that's on the personal level too many times we have a revelation of the message but we never got it down on a personal level [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you see i'm skipping over some stuff i'm sorry i think you've got the point satan's been called out saints prophet's message come called satan now identified he's called out he's identified and he's been rejected hallelujah you've all seen the little stamp apply for something they have accepted or rejected hallelujah you know maybe spiritually you all need to get some of those and when the devil comes around and the devil comes around and he starts throwing something on you why don't you just stomp long enough and reach in your pocket pull that little pad out in that little stamp say see [Music] when he gets right up close because he thinks you want to fellowship with him you can just take that ink pad and reject it depart depart reject it saints i hope somehow this be a blessing to you today you realize oh we got these problems we got these problems no no no you know just got to recognize who you are the true church when she recognizes who she is she will be the invincible army that's what god's allowing to happen he's allowing your recognition your identification ability he's allowing that to be sharpened because the scripture says some people around the message are absolutely afraid of this scripture says it would be so close to deceive the very elect i've seen people post that on social media with dot dot dot dot after that be so close it would deceive the very left and i thought that's a deceiver that would represent it that the very elect could be deceived but my bible says and my prophet quoted if it were what's happening you're being taught to recognize the devil and his wives aren't you glad can we rejoice we're being taught amen we're being taught since we are sitting here we are not failures we are not backslidden we are not lost we are not without revelation but we are being taught and it has to be taken from the mind [Music] what's that little vanessa little vanessa where are you hiding at her oh right in front of me okay now what was that you shared with brother paul at young peoples it starts here [Music] right [Music] [Applause] [Music] starts here it goes here ends up here [Music] oh recognition of who we are in jesus christ in recognition of who we are in jesus christ comes out hallelujah hallelujah oh my jesus signed my pardon what is the song you're playing he is our peace amen hallelujah let's stand he is our peace hallelujah is our peace that's what brings you comfort enough to stop amen sorry i'm just mr talkative this morning but remember the prophet of god talks about the miracle happened in world war one christmas morning the shots being fired they climbed out of their trenches and they come over and they greeted one another they celebrated they gave gifts they shared things and then they realized you see what would happen to all of the spirits of the day if they could have taken that anointing that fell on them there and if all through the land they just laid their arms down the anointed ones would have said no fight fight fight and they would have said no i've given gifts i cannot take this man's life that anointing what was it as a free figure of the peace that was coming there was peace breaking out the anointing breaking out [Music] he is our peace you cannot have the oil saints and not have peace [Music] who has broken down every wall he is our peace who has broken down every wall he is our peace [Music] is for you he is our peace he is our peace cast all your cares on him for he cares for you he [Music] cast is my cares on him let it be from your heart today glory cares for me [Music] he is my peace he is my peace cares for me [Music] he is my peace he is thank you lord hallelujah jesus signed my pardon hallelujah i tell you what i'm going to do saints i'm not going to be that guy that wads up the pardon and stuffs it in his pocket questions whether it's real or not i've been set free i've got a pardon hallelujah i know i've kept you a long time saints if you really gotta go go but i just want to worship the lord for just a few minutes hallelujah i feel good right now i've had this little burden on me for a few weeks to preach this and i knew that it's going to be kind of straight and i feel kind of a liberty it's all off of me i'll give it all to you now amen so i feel free now [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen you're not enough [Music] when this my surely know he took my place on calgary now i don't have to go [Music] now i don't have to go [Music] one more time oh jesus signed my partner for this i surely know he took my place on calgary now i don't

you your loving kindness [Music] is filling my heart as i sing how great are you [Music] how great is how great is how great are you more how great is your mercy how great are the things your loving kindness [Music] is filling my heart as i sing how great are you now saints there's one thing i didn't say in the sermon although the scripture is talking about the mother [Music] that's father's brothers we have the same exact commission you say well where did you get that in the word of god brother paul the word clearly called us to be the priest of our home to lead our family in spiritual sacrifices and worship to the lord amen let's just take the word of god people say well now brother where do you stand you know there was a time when people were leaving the message and i preached a sermon up in canada and people were sure that paul was done that was my exit sermon from the message but you see what we fail to recognize is this message is jesus christ it's not something that we toe our toe up to but i'm telling you you can't criticize a prophet and have a relationship with can't do god [Music] [Applause] saints please don't take paul's word for him speaking my granddaughter liam right there she is in the back i'm telling her your grandpa's the preacher he's the pastor don't just take what he says look for yourself critical thinking doesn't mean you're critical you understand that means that you trust but verify saints trust and then act on it don't be the one that says that's good thinking act on it i tell you what the word of god does brother jason i'm just sorry things i've just had a love affair with this song i go around all day and the tractor and the pickup on the ditch bank wherever i'm at it's i can't get rid of it it's just you know and things
