[30:03] you here tonight amen
[30:05] let's just uh go i want to once again go
[30:08] into the book of proverbs
[30:10] and um just uh look at this you know
[30:14] such wisdom
[30:15] that is here if we just stand to our
[30:18] feet as we go into the word
[30:20] proverbs the 28th chapter and now as
[30:23] we've been going through this saints
[30:24] it's
[30:25] um not as though we've been trying to
[30:28] speak on
[30:28] every single chapter every single verse
[30:31] but just been reading and those things
[30:33] that kind of give
[30:34] you might say a inspiration uh you know
[30:38] and we might backtrack on some of this
[30:40] but um just to look at uh
[30:43] these things and um i pray that what is
[30:46] an inspiration to me will also be an
[30:48] inspiration to you uh
[30:50] and uh we are truly blessed and happy
[30:53] our young people
[30:54] brother chris sister christian have have
[30:57] taken this
[30:58] upon themselves a real burden uh we're
[31:00] not talking about just something like oh
[31:01] hey i've got to do this
[31:03] but i'll just tell you out front all of
[31:05] this has been
[31:07] chris coming and saying what do you
[31:09] think we do this what do you think about
[31:10] pursuing this and
[31:12] i i'm actually quite thrilled that he
[31:14] has that desire
[31:16] that uh enthusiasm of youth
[31:20] to um connect with our youth and i i
[31:22] think it's been beneficial i think we're
[31:24] seeing
[31:25] a great progress there so let's just be
[31:28] praying for them just as our
[31:29] brothers have said we just really want
[31:32] them to go to camp and as i have
[31:34] mentioned in several services
[31:36] we don't want them coming home saying
[31:38] yay we won the volleyball
[31:40] we want him to come home saying you know
[31:41] what i heard some preaching and it
[31:44] touched my heart and it's changed my
[31:45] life
[31:46] and i received the holy ghost and and i
[31:49] just really want to serve the lord and
[31:51] and then we will continue if the lord
[31:54] tarries to
[31:55] to encourage them and do what we can do
[31:58] as a group of believers
[31:59] to keep uh um pressing
[32:02] on and entering in and and them going
[32:05] and
[32:06] and not only making friends uh you know
[32:09] of
[32:09] other believers young people because i
[32:12] think saints it is good
[32:14] when young people can come face to face
[32:17] with people
[32:18] and if i don't have the words just
[32:19] exactly right forgive me but
[32:21] young people they might i'm going to use
[32:23] the words admire
[32:25] they would look at that and go oh you
[32:26] know a sister saying this is a really
[32:28] fine sister a brother saying this is a
[32:30] really fine brother
[32:32] a friend and and encouraging to them to
[32:35] realize
[32:36] they're not the only ones there are
[32:38] other people
[32:39] you know one time a long time ago a man
[32:42] told me he says a thing about i don't
[32:43] like about he had a kind of a work
[32:45] perspective here because thing i don't
[32:46] like about christians they're all boring
[32:50] but that's because his idea of what was
[32:53] not boring was
[32:54] just the things of the world and you
[32:57] guys are boring and
[32:58] i was like yes but what you don't
[33:00] realize is so are you
[33:02] and uh so anyway proverbs the 28th
[33:06] chapter verses one through six
[33:08] amen the wicked flee
[33:11] when no man pursueth but the righteous
[33:15] are bold as a lion for the transgression
[33:19] of a land many are the princes
[33:23] thereof but by a man of understanding
[33:26] and knowledge
[33:27] the state thereof shall be prolonged
[33:31] a poor man that oppresseth the poor
[33:34] is like a sweeping reign which leaveth
[33:37] no
[33:38] food they that forsake the law praise
[33:41] the wicked
[33:42] but such as keep the law contend with
[33:45] them
[33:46] evil men understand
[33:50] not judgment now because it's not going
[33:53] to be one of my thoughts tonight
[33:54] i want to just throw this in look at
[33:57] this spirit that is in the land
[33:59] that people push back against
[34:01] christianity
[34:02] whatever they're living any old way and
[34:04] then they say
[34:06] don't judge me don't jud you're judging
[34:09] me
[34:10] the bible says you're not to judge me
[34:12] but that's not what the bible says
[34:15] the bible says that all things are
[34:17] judged and
[34:18] all men sins either go before them or
[34:22] follow after them and i just listening
[34:25] to the prophet of god and he put it in
[34:27] these words and he says
[34:29] now the very god they claim to serve
[34:32] and love will judge them
[34:37] so we want to make sure ours go before
[34:41] us
[34:42] we want it clean amen i don't mind
[34:45] and i don't believe you mind being
[34:48] judged by the word
[34:50] you see the being judged by the word is
[34:52] not someone saying you're wrong or
[34:54] you're this or you're that
[34:56] but the word judging us is god's way of
[34:58] correcting us
[35:00] those he loves he chastens so the word
[35:03] comes and chastens us
[35:06] and if we're in the right spirit in the
[35:08] right attitude we're saying thank you
[35:10] lord we're not we're not looking to the
[35:11] preacher we're not looking to anything
[35:13] we're looking and saying thank you lord
[35:16] because you're now
[35:17] causing me to to look at my own life
[35:20] and compare it and if it comes up short
[35:23] forgive me lord
[35:25] amen aren't you glad i'm kind of glad
[35:28] now half of my family is catholic i'm
[35:30] kind of glad i'm not catholic
[35:32] because you've got to do all kinds of
[35:34] things to be forgiven as a catholic
[35:36] but we have just to apply the blood of
[35:39] jesus christ just to come and say lord
[35:41] forgive me amen
[35:45] evil men understand not judgment but
[35:48] they that seek the lord
[35:49] understand all things better is the poor
[35:52] that walketh in his uprightness
[35:55] than he that is perverse in his ways
[35:58] though he be rich heavenly father we're
[36:01] asking you this evening
[36:02] father just help us to be concise father
[36:05] lord we know that you're in control of
[36:07] all things
[36:08] and father just help us tonight to be
[36:10] able to speak directly father just to
[36:13] share this and not hold the saints too
[36:15] long in this heat
[36:16] and father once again we lift up our
[36:18] brother chris sister christian
[36:20] and we lift up our young people all the
[36:23] young people lord our brother dwayne who
[36:25] will be preaching
[36:26] the youth camp father lord may you just
[36:29] give
[36:30] unction to him give anointing to him
[36:33] let the words not be his words lord but
[36:36] let it be your voice
[36:37] speaking to the people the young people
[36:40] and let them hear
[36:41] father not a man's voice but your voice
[36:44] father may each and every young person
[36:46] every grown-up father there
[36:48] at the camp lord be changed by the
[36:51] preaching
[36:52] of the word lord we ask this and we ask
[36:55] for your guidance your wisdom and
[36:56] understanding
[36:58] your forgiveness for our short comings
[37:00] lord tonight
[37:01] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[37:04] be seated saints
[37:08] now i i do want to just say this is just
[37:11] kind of a little word to you real quick
[37:13] uh sister jerry and i was in paraguay a
[37:15] few years ago
[37:17] and um would love to take some of you
[37:19] with us there again
[37:21] just as long as you're not squeamish
[37:23] because it was about 114 and
[37:26] the deacons were walking around with one
[37:28] cup
[37:29] and a pitcher of water and they were
[37:31] going down the row
[37:37] and if you were squeamish you didn't get
[37:39] a drink but
[37:41] seeing how you had been sweating and
[37:43] clapping and shouting and everybody's
[37:44] packed together
[37:46] pre-covered of course and uh you know
[37:49] you look at that cup and you're like
[37:51] well praise the lord the lord will keep
[37:53] me amen
[37:55] i tell you that's oftentimes the way i
[37:57] view the communion cup right
[37:59] i'm not speaking against anybody who
[38:01] ever drinks out of the little cups
[38:03] but it doesn't say cups it says cup
[38:07] amen now we look at this and i want to
[38:09] just take a few minutes this evening and
[38:11] just kind of touch upon these six verses
[38:14] i got a couple little quotes to quote uh
[38:17] to to
[38:18] quote at the very end to just kind of
[38:20] make a point
[38:21] but it says the wicked flee when no man
[38:23] pursueth and
[38:24] we know my brother and sister just in
[38:26] the human nature that a guilty
[38:28] conscience
[38:29] tends to cause the behavior of a person
[38:32] to change and
[38:33] often times as they study behavior of
[38:36] people
[38:37] they can tell what is going on with
[38:39] someone by
[38:40] their hands their gestures their eyes
[38:43] their reactions and
[38:44] you look at this and we know that in the
[38:47] age that we live in the prophet of god
[38:49] showed us very clearly that there's only
[38:51] two spirits and
[38:53] so it is then that spirit right of right
[38:55] and wrong and
[38:56] it is that that that people sometimes
[38:59] they
[39:00] they just can't help themselves because
[39:02] deep down within themselves
[39:04] they know that they are not doing the
[39:06] right thing and
[39:07] so the wicked flee no man is pursuing
[39:10] but the thing is my brother and sister
[39:12] is the conscience is always there and so
[39:15] a guilty conscience causes people to
[39:18] act or react in different ways but here
[39:21] it says
[39:22] the righteous are as bold as a lion
[39:25] now if we are looking at this in these
[39:27] scriptures here and looking how it is
[39:29] that we approach
[39:30] god my brother and sister the wicked
[39:33] flee now
[39:34] i i you know only can say it thank you
[39:37] lord it's by his grace
[39:38] but my brother and sister when we
[39:41] backslid and i
[39:42] spent those years of my life backstage i
[39:44] i know this firsthand
[39:46] we tend to run from the very thing we
[39:49] need
[39:50] it's just an interesting
[39:54] thing of humanity that we run away from
[39:56] the very thing
[39:57] that we need it reminds me of a story of
[40:00] of some people who uh
[40:02] uh were down in death valley in
[40:05] california
[40:06] uh they didn't have enough gas for one
[40:09] they took no extra drinking water they
[40:11] had nothing and they run their car out
[40:13] of gas and
[40:14] the man should have just stayed there in
[40:16] the shade of his car with his family
[40:18] done his best
[40:19] to to uh preserve that um
[40:22] but he he said you know uh family you
[40:25] stay here
[40:26] i'm going to go they had driven like 57
[40:29] miles out into death valley and he said
[40:31] i'm going to walk for help and
[40:33] you know by the time somebody noticed a
[40:36] vehicle there and stopped
[40:38] and rescued the wife and the children
[40:40] she said my husband went that direction
[40:42] for help and when they found the man he
[40:44] was so delirious
[40:46] that he actually ran from them they were
[40:49] trying to
[40:49] help him and he just went running off
[40:52] across the desert
[40:53] uh no telling what he was actually
[40:55] thinking but
[40:56] he he was so confused in his thinking
[40:59] that
[40:59] the very help he needed he ran from and
[41:03] i i would just like to type that back
[41:05] tonight
[41:06] that the wicked flee from god when he's
[41:08] the very
[41:09] thing that they need the whole
[41:12] solution to their problem and you know
[41:15] the righteous uh my brother and sister
[41:18] are as bold as a lion
[41:19] now some people would take this
[41:21] scripture and they would say that you
[41:23] should pin
[41:23] everybody you come down and tell them
[41:25] they're going to hell but
[41:27] this is not in continuity with the rest
[41:31] of the word
[41:32] but my brother and sister have you ever
[41:33] noticed how satan
[41:35] tries to make us timid as believers
[41:39] now we we are to turn the other cheek
[41:41] there's a lot of scriptures that will
[41:43] balance that you know
[41:45] that we should uh you know if they ask
[41:48] for your
[41:48] uh cloak you you give them the whole
[41:50] garment all of these different
[41:52] scriptures but
[41:53] it doesn't say anywhere that we are
[41:55] called to be timid
[41:57] and we are called to stand for what we
[41:59] believe were to stand upon the word
[42:02] unwavering and the righteous are bold as
[42:05] a lion
[42:05] now let's take this as i just shared in
[42:07] the continuity or context
[42:09] of coming to god we do not come as
[42:12] beggars do we
[42:14] we do not come as it is timid
[42:17] see we have to understand the difference
[42:19] of timid
[42:21] and respectful timid and uh
[42:24] coming in in uh um the words escaping me
[42:28] oh my
[42:29] to come in reverence no we need to
[42:32] we need to find that balance timid is
[42:35] not the solution
[42:37] we come and i always like and you know
[42:39] this i love to use
[42:40] esther as an example esther did not come
[42:43] into the fourier
[42:44] of the palace and crawl to the throne
[42:48] she come and presented herself not
[42:50] boisterous
[42:51] not demanding but knowing that her
[42:54] husband
[42:55] loved her she came boldly
[42:58] she didn't send a note and have it
[43:00] smuggled to him
[43:02] she presented herself ready
[43:05] to meet the king oh i think there's a
[43:09] lot to be said in that
[43:10] not coming she didn't show up in a house
[43:12] coat she didn't show up in her hair in
[43:14] curlers
[43:16] he might have just loved her the same
[43:17] that way she was his wife
[43:19] but my brother and sister she knew how
[43:21] to present herself to the king
[43:23] and she came a presentable amen
[43:27] she was bold truly bold to come
[43:31] we would look at the shutamite woman my
[43:33] brother and sister
[43:34] she did not come groveling but she come
[43:37] even to the point to say all is well
[43:41] all is well why because did she have a
[43:44] false hope no she had a confidence she
[43:46] came boldly knowing
[43:47] that in a moment when the timing is
[43:50] right
[43:50] she didn't come groveling my baby's dead
[43:53] you know you promised this why did you
[43:55] make this happen
[43:55] she just come and she knew the moment
[43:58] would be right
[43:59] and the spirit of god moving on the
[44:02] prophet
[44:02] recognized her spirit was troubled and
[44:05] the door is open for her then to speak
[44:08] so we want to come my brother and sister
[44:11] not with a
[44:12] guilty conscience not as it is in first
[44:16] john you know this is i hate to admit
[44:19] this right but we might as well all just
[44:21] put the rubber on the road
[44:22] have you ever experienced this i think
[44:25] every one of us as believers would say
[44:27] we've experienced this
[44:29] if our heart condemn us not you see if
[44:31] our hearts condemning us
[44:33] then we we just can't even hardly even
[44:35] pray even the meagerist of prayers
[44:37] but if we are coming in confidence right
[44:40] boldly
[44:41] coming in a confidence that we are sons
[44:43] and daughters of god
[44:44] and the scripture says that he is quick
[44:46] to forgive us
[44:48] we don't have and that's why i made the
[44:50] comment earlier we don't have a ritual
[44:53] we have to follow through to find
[44:56] forgiveness
[44:57] we have the utter simplicity of the
[44:59] gospel to come
[45:00] and say lord forgive me and it is a
[45:03] finished work so if our heart condemn us
[45:05] not
[45:06] then we have confidence toward god and
[45:09] so
[45:09] i have i'm ashamed to say this but i'm
[45:12] human
[45:12] i have had it times that it would be as
[45:15] though
[45:16] i had maybe a terrible day and my phone
[45:18] rings and somebody says brother paul
[45:21] this situation this situation this
[45:23] situation
[45:24] can you pray and you're there thinking
[45:26] why would god
[45:27] answer my prayer why would i you know
[45:30] it's like
[45:31] of all the days if they would have
[45:33] called yesterday or the day before
[45:36] or last sunday i would have boldly stood
[45:40] and said we're going to the throne
[45:42] and we are going to change this but it
[45:44] seems like the day that i have
[45:46] fallen down the day that i have
[45:49] i don't know let's just take something
[45:50] simple then impatience and maybe even
[45:53] angry i know none of you have that
[45:55] problem
[45:59] and it's at that moment ring ring
[46:04] but we're learning in that time
[46:09] we're still sons and daughters of god in
[46:12] that time
[46:13] we still have access to the throne
[46:17] so what do we do we deal with the
[46:19] condemnation first
[46:21] how do you deal with condemnation true
[46:24] repentance
[46:25] wipes away all condemnation aren't you
[46:27] glad my
[46:29] my dad when he was in the navy was a
[46:30] flight engineer and
[46:32] one time bogota colombia they flew in
[46:34] there
[46:35] there was different diplomats and
[46:37] different things dealing with the
[46:38] government of colombia
[46:40] and they said you know go stay in the
[46:42] heart of the city don't go out into the
[46:44] the suburbs don't go anywhere no blind
[46:46] alleys no dark alleys no whatever's just
[46:48] stay
[46:49] so my dad just went right in the heart
[46:51] of bogota colombia and walked around
[46:53] and literally come upon this saint this
[46:55] is not a story this is my dad's personal
[46:57] witness
[46:58] that there was a man catholic church my
[47:00] dad raised catholic
[47:01] and uh catholic church and here is a man
[47:04] crawling
[47:04] up to the steps and they were chip stone
[47:07] you know uh steps and on his knees
[47:11] and he's praying a prayer and crying out
[47:13] to mary
[47:15] and then moving up to the next step and
[47:17] my dad as he observed this he actually
[47:19] went up those three or four flights of
[47:21] stairs and went in and walked through
[47:23] the church
[47:24] and the man was from the same tier out
[47:26] of i think it was three or four i'm not
[47:28] i don't remember exactly
[47:29] and already blood on the steps behind
[47:32] him
[47:33] crying out to mary for forgiveness
[47:37] aren't you glad i'm glad not just for
[47:40] the physical pain my brother and sister
[47:42] but for the revelation to know that the
[47:45] blood of jesus christ
[47:47] wipes away washes away all sin it's not
[47:50] about
[47:51] persevering to to be crippled
[47:55] as it were to to bring that to pass
[47:58] so we we want to come as it were
[48:02] uh as bold as a lion my brother and
[48:04] sister so that means we got to keep the
[48:06] slate clean
[48:07] right amen we've got to just keep wiping
[48:09] the slate clean
[48:10] and we do that by the blood of jesus
[48:12] christ amen
[48:14] so now i like verse 2 in the sense for
[48:16] the transgression of a land
[48:18] many are the princes they're relevant i
[48:20] i tell you
[48:22] you know the prophet of god now i didn't
[48:23] go ahead and go into this quote yes if
[48:26] you please go back to that scripture
[48:27] brother
[48:28] uh isaac uh now i didn't bring up these
[48:31] quotes we know them
[48:32] amen but brother branham says that
[48:34] america being so far gone
[48:36] that a george washington and abraham
[48:38] lincoln on every corner will not change
[48:41] the direction
[48:42] of our nation and he has some words that
[48:45] are even stronger than that
[48:47] but we'll look at this my brother and
[48:49] sister we'll see
[48:50] that many the transgression of land many
[48:53] are the princes thereof and
[48:54] i want you to just look in the world
[48:56] we're living in today and there are many
[48:58] princes of this there's the princes of
[49:01] hollywood
[49:02] and the princes of this pleasure and
[49:03] that pleasure and there's princes
[49:05] everywhere promoting
[49:08] all of these things that are a
[49:09] transgression before god and
[49:12] and they're everywhere and they're
[49:13] widely accepted it
[49:16] there are so many of these princes
[49:18] presenting themselves and i would say
[49:20] in this context so we would understand
[49:22] there's many princesses to go with the
[49:24] princes
[49:25] and so it's there that we look and and
[49:27] now pardon me i hope none of you
[49:29] hold to these things because i'm just
[49:31] going to blast it for a minute
[49:32] but the whole world is judging a
[49:35] fashion and what is moral and
[49:38] presentable
[49:39] by some people named kardashian and
[49:42] they're going gonna get kardashian all
[49:44] right uh they're gonna come a day that
[49:46] without repenting they're they're gonna
[49:48] find a judgment
[49:50] that's going to dash all their hopes and
[49:53] these people and i'll bring this out
[49:55] just to make a point these people are so
[49:57] fringe in their idea of who god is
[49:59] to evade taxes they started their own
[50:02] church
[50:04] so they can give millions to their own
[50:06] church and now they're priests and
[50:08] priests uh priestesses of their own
[50:11] religion
[50:12] and therefore they can draw salary
[50:14] without paying wages or an expense
[50:16] account without paying taxes on this
[50:18] and so this is how little they see or
[50:21] how little respect and
[50:22] i should have brought that quote up
[50:24] instead of just trying to paraphrase it
[50:26] here
[50:26] but the prophet of god said that come to
[50:28] a day that they will
[50:29] manhandle and mishandle the word of god
[50:32] with
[50:33] no respect or reverence
[50:37] so it's a good tax write-off
[50:40] and then people dress and act like these
[50:42] people
[50:43] you see what kind of princes of the land
[50:46] that they are choosing but by
[50:50] a man of understanding and knowledge the
[50:52] state thereof shall be prolonged
[50:54] now i want you to look at this my
[50:56] brother and sister that when we're
[50:58] talking about prolonged here
[51:00] this is as it were ties right back to
[51:03] uh the fact that even though the word
[51:06] says that time would be shortened
[51:07] the prophet of god shows us clearly how
[51:10] that god is not going to
[51:11] cut this off until you and i are ready
[51:15] and this is something that we want to
[51:17] look at in the context of
[51:19] hey i'm not going to just drag this out
[51:21] that's not what the spirit of the
[51:22] believer is
[51:24] the spirit believer wants to stand in
[51:26] the presence
[51:27] of the son and be brought to maturity
[51:30] we're not wanting to drag this out
[51:32] amen in fact you look around and it
[51:34] actually kind of is sickening
[51:36] what we see in the world today uh so
[51:40] we'll see how that many evil around us
[51:43] uh but you know the lord is keeping us
[51:45] can anyone can you agree tonight the
[51:47] lord is keeping us in this present world
[51:50] amen in this present darkness
[51:53] god is keeping us now that doesn't mean
[51:55] we're mistake free
[51:58] but under the anointing of the word we
[52:02] are
[52:02] repentant people and we find liberty
[52:06] in the blood of jesus christ now this
[52:08] message my brother and sister and i say
[52:10] this emphatic
[52:12] this message is a message of liberty
[52:15] if one feels like they are bound inside
[52:18] the constraints of this message
[52:20] there is something wrong there there is
[52:23] an altar to be found there is repentance
[52:26] to be brought
[52:27] a changing of the thinking and you'll
[52:30] find this and i'm not going to get
[52:31] sidetracked into this but you'll find
[52:33] that many of the people that are
[52:35] quitting
[52:36] say oh now that we're gone i feel
[52:39] so free but a message of liberty
[52:43] is what sets us free it is not the
[52:46] spirit of laodicea
[52:48] my brother and sister the word shows us
[52:50] so clearly
[52:51] that in the year of the jubilee as they
[52:54] come to make the decision
[52:56] of what they viewed as security
[53:00] some were secure to put their ear to the
[53:03] post
[53:04] and have an all driven through it
[53:08] that was their idea of security they'll
[53:11] take care of me from the cradle
[53:13] to the grave but you see this bride's
[53:16] not looking from cradle to grave
[53:19] we're looking as it were from the
[53:21] foundations of the world
[53:23] to eternity at the throne of god we're
[53:26] not concerned about cradle and grave
[53:28] we're not concerned about these things
[53:30] we have a much bigger picture that by
[53:33] god's grace so let's go back to that
[53:35] scripture right here
[53:36] and just kind of touch on that again
[53:38] here amen
[53:40] for transgression of a land many are the
[53:42] princes thereof
[53:43] but by a man of understanding and
[53:46] knowledge amen that's how we're able to
[53:49] look at this picture entirely different
[53:52] than the world now i have no i no doubt
[53:55] my brother and sister if i could just
[53:56] put this
[53:57] that that donald trump being president
[53:59] of the united states
[54:00] had a tremendous effect he he made it so
[54:03] that people had a liberty to stand up
[54:05] and say
[54:06] we love the lord you know all these
[54:08] things and and
[54:10] and he made that very comfortable but
[54:12] you know
[54:13] we can look at this and and i i don't
[54:15] want to get in it tonight and people
[54:17] have different perspectives
[54:19] even to the point that at a point in
[54:21] time people were like
[54:22] you know uh donald trump is a savior of
[54:25] our nation
[54:26] no i'm sorry jesus christ is the savior
[54:29] of our nation
[54:30] and our nation is rejecting him
[54:33] they like the tax breaks and they like
[54:36] the liberties and they like all of this
[54:38] but that's not what this nation was
[54:40] founded on
[54:42] amen so we'll see how the thinking of
[54:44] man has become
[54:45] even warped in the time that we live in
[54:48] so i'm glad i'll say tonight i can lift
[54:50] my hand
[54:51] and say the lord is keeping us in this
[54:53] present time
[54:54] now look he's using people get confused
[54:57] about this right because we're living in
[54:59] a world that we're saying lord come
[55:01] quickly
[55:01] we want to be out of here we want to be
[55:03] done we don't identify with this world
[55:05] but look how this works god
[55:07] is using the resources of this corrupt
[55:11] world to provide for you and i
[55:13] know now you want to type in scripture
[55:15] for that anybody neither type in
[55:17] scripture
[55:18] when israel was coming out of goshen god
[55:20] anointed them to be
[55:22] bold and they went to their egyptian
[55:24] neighbors and said give me your cart
[55:26] give me your wheat give me your pots and
[55:28] pans give me this give me that
[55:30] and they under an anointing were not
[55:33] able to
[55:34] reject them so god gave provision
[55:37] i hope you see this broad picture god
[55:40] gave provision
[55:41] of egypt for them to go to the promised
[55:45] land
[55:45] and we are seeing that once again right
[55:48] here
[55:48] right now god giving us provision
[55:52] out of this world
[55:55] to go to the promised land now it's the
[55:58] word of god that gets us to the promised
[55:59] land but god knows how to sustain us
[56:01] naturally
[56:02] amen that's all part of the plan of god
[56:05] so we look at this because my brother
[56:07] and sister some people are like well
[56:09] well we just when's the lord gonna come
[56:11] when's the lord gonna come let's get in
[56:12] the presence of the son and get mature
[56:16] we want the lord to come get in the
[56:17] presence of the son
[56:19] and get mature god's not going to take
[56:22] an immature bride look i i've shared
[56:24] this story before
[56:25] i don't want to discredit brother donnie
[56:26] by sharing this and maybe not getting it
[56:28] right
[56:29] but i remember brother donny talking
[56:31] about how it would be a scenario
[56:33] that maybe a man would call him up and
[56:34] say brother donnie um i'm engaged and uh
[56:37] you know i want with my fiance to come
[56:39] and talk to you to get ready for a
[56:41] wedding
[56:41] and brother donny would say come on down
[56:43] i'll meet you in the office and the
[56:44] brother comes in there and walks in with
[56:46] a twelve-year-old
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] no brother donna'd be like oh brother
[56:52] you're confused
[56:54] you're confused this is not a bride this
[56:56] is a child
[56:57] right you take a mature woman to a
[57:00] wedding
[57:02] you don't take a child we're not
[57:04] perverted like some countries
[57:06] amen and god's not going to take an
[57:08] immature bride
[57:10] right and then when she's in heaven grow
[57:13] her up
[57:15] no sir this is our season this is our
[57:17] time we're standing in the presence of
[57:19] the sun
[57:20] coming into a full maturity of the
[57:22] revelation of the redemption of
[57:24] almighty god that plan of redemption
[57:27] which we can tie directly over into the
[57:29] seals
[57:30] and the seventh seal the whole plan of
[57:32] redemption revealed
[57:34] so the plan of redemption is open to you
[57:36] and i
[57:37] now we come into the maturity of that
[57:40] plan of redemption that mystery
[57:43] amen just because it was open we don't
[57:45] go in as a mature bride
[57:46] amen i mean immature bright so this is
[57:50] our season of maturing for the bride
[57:52] this is a season of prophetic
[57:56] fulfillment there is a lot of
[58:00] prophecy my brother and sister that
[58:02] still has to come to pass
[58:05] now some people are like well we quit
[58:07] believing that brother branham was a
[58:08] prophet of god
[58:10] because this this and this and this
[58:11] haven't come to pass
[58:13] well my brother and sister even in this
[58:15] great age of technology
[58:18] we don't know what happened in india
[58:20] today we don't know the miracles i'm
[58:22] just talking about the worldly things we
[58:24] don't know the miracles that happen in
[58:25] africa today
[58:26] we don't know what happened in europe
[58:27] today or asia today we don't know what
[58:30] happened
[58:30] in the little church or the prayer room
[58:35] many things are being fulfilled that
[58:37] people will say well i can't believe
[58:39] this because this wasn't fulfilled
[58:41] god didn't say i'm going to put it on
[58:42] cnn god didn't say i'm going to
[58:45] blast it to the whole world when
[58:47] somebody has
[58:48] come and as it were prophesied and watch
[58:51] it come to pass
[58:52] and when i say prophesy as sons and
[58:54] daughters of god
[58:55] we are called to prophesy do you know
[58:57] that we are not called to just be mute
[59:00] but we are called to prophesy and
[59:02] prophecy can
[59:03] in its utter form be as simple as
[59:06] declaring
[59:07] god's going to heal me i believe it
[59:10] and so you are then speaking what is
[59:13] going to
[59:13] take place in your life and i want to
[59:16] ask you tonight have you ever seen that
[59:18] happen
[59:20] i have seen god answer prayer time after
[59:23] time
[59:24] and we have voiced the things not out of
[59:27] some supreme confidence or
[59:29] you know arrogance but we were speaking
[59:32] because the word said
[59:33] speak those things that are not as
[59:36] though they
[59:37] are and those things that are as though
[59:39] they are not you got to speak it
[59:42] so you what you are doing you are coming
[59:44] as i'm going to put it these terms and
[59:46] you'll understand
[59:47] a minor prophet speaking the very things
[59:50] that
[59:50] are going to come to pass in your life
[59:54] that's why when like our young people
[59:55] going off to camp if they can get right
[59:57] down there in camp
[59:59] and stand in that atmosphere and say
[1:00:02] lord
[1:00:02] those that maybe don't have the holy
[1:00:04] ghost say lord i want the holy ghost
[1:00:06] i need it i claim it and god says there
[1:00:10] you are you're speaking it you're
[1:00:11] speaking it i'm going to answer that
[1:00:13] prophecy
[1:00:14] i'm going to answer that word and i'm
[1:00:16] going to fulfill that
[1:00:17] and the bible's clear full my brother
[1:00:19] and sister of these examples
[1:00:21] of men speaking those things and it
[1:00:24] coming
[1:00:25] to pass hallelujah are we any different
[1:00:30] did you know this is a sideline note
[1:00:33] probably ruined another sermon i had my
[1:00:35] mind but did you know
[1:00:38] you are completely interchangeable
[1:00:44] in the body of christ
[1:00:49] are you with me in other words god if he
[1:00:52] had chose
[1:00:54] could have taken you and put you in the
[1:00:57] colosseum
[1:01:02] brother paul i don't like big cats
[1:01:06] no no saints the faith that is in you
[1:01:10] your ability to believe and manifest the
[1:01:13] word
[1:01:14] means god could have taken you and put
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:17] into the colosseum he could have put you
[1:01:20] in the first church age second third
[1:01:21] fourth fifth
[1:01:22] sixth but god in his infinite wisdom
[1:01:24] says you know what
[1:01:25] i'm going to come down in the darkest of
[1:01:27] ages and i've got a people
[1:01:29] already selected this is predestination
[1:01:31] a people already selected
[1:01:33] that will stand in laodicea
[1:01:37] and so god would say they would overcome
[1:01:39] in the first stage if i'd have put them
[1:01:40] there
[1:01:41] they'd overcome in the second age if i
[1:01:43] would have put them there and the third
[1:01:44] and the fourth and the fifth and the
[1:01:46] sixth but i chose them
[1:01:47] for leo to see i chose them for the
[1:01:49] seventh age
[1:01:52] but you're completely interchangeable so
[1:01:54] you say oh my look at this saints there
[1:01:55] with the apostle paul
[1:01:56] and look what was happening over here
[1:01:58] and look what's happening happening
[1:01:59] there do you realize my brother sister
[1:02:01] come on i hope you catch it you realize
[1:02:03] god could have placed you there
[1:02:04] if he had chose to and you would not
[1:02:07] have failed
[1:02:10] praise the lord you would have been an
[1:02:11] overcomer there just like you are an
[1:02:13] overcomer here
[1:02:14] hallelujah amen so the lord's keeping us
[1:02:18] amen a season of prophetic fulfillment
[1:02:22] because every word is going to
[1:02:25] be fulfilled every single word
[1:02:29] hallelujah now i want to move forward
[1:02:31] because i just
[1:02:33] i'm overheating
[1:02:36] verse 3 a poor man that oppresses the
[1:02:38] poor
[1:02:40] is like a sweeping rain which leaveth
[1:02:44] no food now
[1:02:47] my brother and sister you'll look at
[1:02:48] this and i think that's pretty
[1:02:50] self-explanatory if you've ever
[1:02:54] been we just had one of those kind of
[1:02:56] rainstorms out there
[1:02:58] at the farm the other day and it rained
[1:03:01] so hard
[1:03:02] for about 15 minutes 20 minutes max
[1:03:06] everything was muddy you couldn't do
[1:03:07] anything we were just basically done
[1:03:10] but before the sun went down that night
[1:03:13] the ground
[1:03:14] was completely dry again
[1:03:21] a sweeping rain now if you go look it up
[1:03:24] brother branham uses this term in like a
[1:03:26] prayer
[1:03:27] talking about a revival moving like a
[1:03:30] sweeping rain in other words
[1:03:31] he was referencing it to coming and
[1:03:34] passing over everyone
[1:03:35] so don't get confused this is not a
[1:03:37] conflict brother brown's using this as a
[1:03:39] term
[1:03:40] of a rain that comes and a moving of the
[1:03:42] holy spirit sweeping across the whole
[1:03:44] church but you look at this now what
[1:03:46] they're saying here
[1:03:47] is a rain that come and it left an
[1:03:49] evidence
[1:03:50] of its presence but there was nothing
[1:03:52] that soaked down
[1:03:54] into the roots of the plant to bring
[1:03:57] a continued life and the scripture now
[1:04:00] saying here it is a poor man that
[1:04:02] oppresses the poor
[1:04:04] is like a sweeping reign so there's
[1:04:06] something there
[1:04:08] that that just is incongruent with with
[1:04:11] what should be
[1:04:12] you would think that a poor man would
[1:04:13] have sympathy for a poor man
[1:04:15] you would think that one that had been
[1:04:17] through great trials and travails
[1:04:19] would have mercy on those that were
[1:04:21] around them but they like a sweeping
[1:04:23] rain come through
[1:04:24] had an impact that had no lasting
[1:04:26] positive effect
[1:04:30] in other words what they did didn't help
[1:04:34] the poor
[1:04:36] didn't change the direction of anything
[1:04:39] now you know we have scripture to to
[1:04:43] uh go with this amen let's just grab
[1:04:46] this right here in matthew
[1:04:48] 18. let's look at this
[1:04:51] now how it is that a poor man can
[1:04:53] oppress
[1:04:54] one another right here perfect example
[1:04:57] in scripture for us
[1:04:59] then came petered him and said lord how
[1:05:00] oft shall my brother sin against me
[1:05:02] and i forgive him any of you ever
[1:05:06] thought about that one
[1:05:08] of course none of you have ever been
[1:05:10] offended or had someone
[1:05:12] do something to you right we've all just
[1:05:15] grown up in just a perfect atmosphere
[1:05:18] i remember one time a minister brother
[1:05:20] told me he said
[1:05:22] brother paul he said it confuses me to a
[1:05:24] degree as a man
[1:05:26] of how the message could attract so many
[1:05:29] con men
[1:05:30] liars cheats and thieves
[1:05:36] i hate to even bring that up right but
[1:05:39] you see people have this idea that the
[1:05:40] message the pure word of god for this
[1:05:42] hour
[1:05:43] everything about it would be pure well
[1:05:45] the word itself
[1:05:46] is pure and the effect it has on the
[1:05:49] real believer is pure
[1:05:51] but you'll find that many people fit
[1:05:53] right in here with this
[1:05:55] they just see a group of people drawn
[1:05:57] together what can i get out of them
[1:05:59] i remember when i first started the
[1:06:01] pastor of the church side note here is
[1:06:03] it okay amen side note here
[1:06:05] i told myself i remember speaking to
[1:06:07] jerry if anybody ever comes in our
[1:06:09] church and starts peddling
[1:06:11] mlm i will preach at them from the
[1:06:14] pulpit
[1:06:15] and i don't like to approach things that
[1:06:17] direct
[1:06:18] right i don't but you know what i've
[1:06:20] seen this before
[1:06:21] you see one it's like oh brother trevor
[1:06:23] assistant carrie only five hundred
[1:06:25] dollars to sign up
[1:06:26] and in a few months you'll have 50
[1:06:28] people under you and be getting checks
[1:06:29] for seven or eight thousand dollars
[1:06:31] thank you for the 500 thank you for the
[1:06:33] 500 thank you for the 500.
[1:06:35] in a few months these people are so
[1:06:37] discouraged they just give up because
[1:06:39] nothing what nobody's interested
[1:06:41] how did i get into this how did i get
[1:06:43] conned into this thing
[1:06:44] you see my brother and sister that's not
[1:06:46] what the house of gods for
[1:06:48] amen that's not what the body of
[1:06:50] believers is for and it's not for us to
[1:06:52] come
[1:06:53] and uh have a negative impact on other
[1:06:56] in fact the word shows us
[1:06:58] that we should go out of our way to lift
[1:07:01] up our brothers and sisters
[1:07:05] how oft shall my brother sin against me
[1:07:07] and i forgive him
[1:07:09] tell seven times lord with that i mean
[1:07:11] would that be reasonable
[1:07:14] some of you already ran out no
[1:07:19] seven times no jesus said unto him i say
[1:07:23] not unto thee until seven times
[1:07:25] but until seventy times 7
[1:07:28] that is an incredible amount of
[1:07:30] forgiveness that's an incredible amount
[1:07:32] of mercy
[1:07:33] that is not god giving to us because we
[1:07:36] can't measure his mercy
[1:07:38] this is our mercy between us
[1:07:43] isn't that incredible you imagine now
[1:07:45] somebody's gonna have to really work at
[1:07:47] it to offend you 490 times in one day
[1:07:51] that's something's really malfunctioning
[1:07:52] here right
[1:07:54] even in the worst of whatever it might
[1:07:56] be so
[1:07:57] you look at this therefore is the
[1:07:59] kingdom of heaven lacking to a certain
[1:08:01] king
[1:08:02] which could take account of his servants
[1:08:03] and when he had begun to reckon
[1:08:05] one was brought unto him which owed him
[1:08:07] ten thousand
[1:08:08] talents but as for much as he had not to
[1:08:12] pay his lord commanded him to be sold
[1:08:14] and his wife and his children and all
[1:08:15] that he had and payment to be made
[1:08:17] my brother and sister this is this this
[1:08:19] is a supreme sacrifice this man
[1:08:22] has for a debt his wife and his children
[1:08:25] himself
[1:08:26] all just probably being split up sent
[1:08:28] down the road to bring a price to pay a
[1:08:30] debt
[1:08:33] hmm the servant therefore fell down and
[1:08:37] worship him saying lord
[1:08:39] have patience with me i will pay thee
[1:08:41] all
[1:08:42] then the lord of that servant was moved
[1:08:44] with compassion and loosed him and
[1:08:46] forgave him
[1:08:47] and it's done clean finished oh my
[1:08:52] but the same servant
[1:08:57] couldn't just couldn't get over that the
[1:09:00] mercy that had been shown to him
[1:09:02] he could not pass it on
[1:09:07] imagine somebody being so bold to come
[1:09:09] and say please forgive me for something
[1:09:12] but i'm not going to forgive
[1:09:19] the you servant went out and found one
[1:09:21] of his fellow servants which owed him a
[1:09:23] hundred pence and laid hands on him
[1:09:25] and took him by the throat saying pay me
[1:09:27] the thou owest
[1:09:29] my this is pretty rough guy huh and his
[1:09:32] fellow servant fell down at his feet be
[1:09:34] uh
[1:09:34] they sought him saying have patience
[1:09:36] with me and i will pay thee all right
[1:09:38] same word should have echoed back in
[1:09:39] and he would not but wouldn't cast him
[1:09:42] into prison
[1:09:43] till he should pay the debt so when his
[1:09:45] fellow servants saw what was done
[1:09:47] they were very sorry and came and told
[1:09:49] them to their lord all that was done
[1:09:51] then his lord after that he called him
[1:09:53] said unto him o
[1:09:54] thou wicked servant he didn't even say
[1:09:57] misguided or
[1:09:58] you didn't have a revelation of this he
[1:10:00] says he's wicked
[1:10:02] i forgave thee all that debt and because
[1:10:05] thou desired me
[1:10:06] should us not thou also have compassion
[1:10:08] on thy fellow servant even as i had pity
[1:10:11] on thee
[1:10:12] and his lord was wrong delivered him to
[1:10:15] the tormentors
[1:10:16] till he should pay all that was due unto
[1:10:18] him so
[1:10:19] likewise shall my heavenly father do
[1:10:22] also unto you
[1:10:24] if you from your hearts forgive not
[1:10:25] everyone his brother
[1:10:27] their trespasses that's pretty that's
[1:10:29] pretty abrupt
[1:10:31] right i mean i don't think we need a
[1:10:33] revelation we don't need to go get
[1:10:35] the theosaurus and the dictionary and
[1:10:37] all of the lexicons
[1:10:39] to go back and study this to understand
[1:10:42] what was just spoken
[1:10:45] talking to the young people you know do
[1:10:48] unto others as you want done unto you as
[1:10:50] our old paraphrase of the scripture
[1:10:53] you want forgiveness you want friends
[1:10:55] you want all of this
[1:10:56] we do that adults are we listening
[1:11:00] amen let's just put it a little stronger
[1:11:05] every brother and this sister what in
[1:11:07] this church whether you feel like they
[1:11:09] are
[1:11:10] devoted 100 or not you ought to look at
[1:11:14] them
[1:11:15] with compassion and prayer and
[1:11:18] lift them up and call them brother and
[1:11:20] call them sister
[1:11:21] not judging whether they're worthy or
[1:11:24] not
[1:11:24] of our approval
[1:11:34] so you look at this
[1:11:40] this sweeping rain it's a rain that only
[1:11:43] gets things wet
[1:11:45] never soaks in for sustaining life
[1:11:51] gone in a very short time
[1:11:55] now i want to say saints
[1:12:01] when we come and we do something for
[1:12:04] someone
[1:12:06] when we help or we bless someone with
[1:12:08] something
[1:12:09] if it does not come from our heart
[1:12:14] where is it coming from do we have an
[1:12:18] agenda do we have a motive do we have a
[1:12:20] purpose
[1:12:22] if it does not come from our heart we
[1:12:23] need to question why we're doing this
[1:12:27] but i'll tell you this my brother and
[1:12:28] sister whether you
[1:12:31] not them you are rich or poor
[1:12:34] if you do this from the heart you love
[1:12:36] them from the heart you pray from
[1:12:38] them from the heart you help them maybe
[1:12:40] financially something lord lays on your
[1:12:42] heart whatever it might be
[1:12:44] just sometimes a a arm around the
[1:12:47] shoulder
[1:12:47] a hug saying god bless you we love you
[1:12:50] so whatever it is
[1:12:51] you do that whether you are rich or poor
[1:12:53] you do that
[1:12:54] and be a blessing to someone and god
[1:12:57] said i'll open the windows of heaven
[1:12:59] and pour blessings out upon you
[1:13:02] you see it's all about the intent
[1:13:06] or the purpose of our heart why we do
[1:13:08] this
[1:13:09] you see if we do it for the wrong motive
[1:13:11] we may as well not do it
[1:13:13] we do it for the right motive god said i
[1:13:15] will fill
[1:13:16] your house full of treasure now he
[1:13:19] didn't say gold
[1:13:21] he didn't say silver he didn't say
[1:13:23] stocks and bonds in real estate
[1:13:25] he said treasure now treasure might be a
[1:13:28] godly wife or a godly husband children
[1:13:31] serving the lord
[1:13:32] might be the car that never breaks down
[1:13:34] it might be the tires that go a hundred
[1:13:36] thousand miles might be a refrigerator
[1:13:38] that you look at and say my
[1:13:39] we've had that thing for 25 years it
[1:13:42] might be a washer or dryer
[1:13:44] that you got for when you got married
[1:13:46] and now you've got four kids in the
[1:13:48] years have went by and it still works
[1:13:51] see god pours his blessings out in
[1:13:52] various ways
[1:13:56] i knew a brother once drove a station
[1:13:58] wagon
[1:14:00] i don't remember now the miles but
[1:14:02] incredible amount of miles
[1:14:03] and he actually pointed it out to me and
[1:14:05] says brother paul them tires have been
[1:14:07] on there for over a hundred thousand
[1:14:08] miles
[1:14:10] now i'm telling you my brother and
[1:14:11] sister that's god
[1:14:14] putting treasure in your house
[1:14:21] are we okay amen they that forsake the
[1:14:25] law praise the wicked now i'm gonna
[1:14:27] speak
[1:14:27] you know these are words that come to me
[1:14:29] while i was studying and
[1:14:31] and they're gonna be a little bit direct
[1:14:33] and please forgive me i i wouldn't
[1:14:34] offend any one of you for no reason
[1:14:36] but my brother and sister they that
[1:14:37] first take the law praise the wicked
[1:14:39] now i tell you what come to me as i was
[1:14:42] studying this
[1:14:43] you see my brother and sister many times
[1:14:45] let's talk about the realm of this
[1:14:46] message we don't got to worry about all
[1:14:47] the rest of this garbage out here
[1:14:50] it is what it is and you ain't going to
[1:14:51] change it but around the message
[1:14:53] we tend to allow people to bring in
[1:14:57] ideas and make statements concerning the
[1:15:00] message
[1:15:01] that do not line up with the word of god
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:04] everybody is like oh that's a good
[1:15:06] brother he's just doesn't understand
[1:15:08] look there's only two spirits in the
[1:15:10] framework of the church
[1:15:12] so let's not be praising someone who
[1:15:15] is then putting a twist on the word of
[1:15:17] god don't be trying to lift that up
[1:15:18] because what you do is you send a mixed
[1:15:20] message where people go well they
[1:15:22] believe this over here but i guess
[1:15:24] that's all right no my brother and
[1:15:25] sister
[1:15:26] we believe the word of god for the hour
[1:15:30] we don't need to put a twist or a spin
[1:15:32] it don't need to have a sinker it's not
[1:15:33] a spitball
[1:15:35] amen it needs to just come straight out
[1:15:37] of the word straight to you and i
[1:15:39] and so let's not praise the wicked let's
[1:15:42] not praise that right
[1:15:43] because the prophet of god said this
[1:15:44] when you come up to a place
[1:15:46] where you are opposed to the word of god
[1:15:49] any bit of the scripture i'm just
[1:15:51] paraphrasing this
[1:15:52] any bit of the scripture you're opposed
[1:15:54] to that
[1:15:55] that is an antichrist spirit
[1:15:59] this is not my brother and sister
[1:16:01] differences of opinion
[1:16:03] it is not me interpreting they
[1:16:06] interpreting
[1:16:07] brother branham preached it god
[1:16:09] interprets his
[1:16:11] own word amen so don't be given praise
[1:16:14] to these people
[1:16:16] that are then causing people to get all
[1:16:18] twisted up in what they are
[1:16:20] taught and what they believe and how it
[1:16:22] is and then you come and then people are
[1:16:24] like but but everybody speaks so highly
[1:16:26] of this guy
[1:16:27] and well he's got a great sinker ball
[1:16:31] no come on let's face it saints we need
[1:16:34] to come as a message and start just
[1:16:36] standing up and saying you know what
[1:16:37] i i this doesn't line up with a word and
[1:16:40] i can't support that
[1:16:41] we don't have to speak ill in fact i can
[1:16:43] give you quotes where brother brown says
[1:16:45] you don't speak ill of them you don't
[1:16:46] criticize them you pray for them
[1:16:49] amen but you don't you are are we on the
[1:16:51] same page
[1:16:52] you you aren't going to criticize them
[1:16:55] and that's a human fault that we many
[1:16:57] times have
[1:16:57] that we are going to lift them up and
[1:16:59] pray for them but we don't go over here
[1:17:02] and then talk about what a wonderful
[1:17:03] spiritual guy this is
[1:17:05] that has something that won't line up
[1:17:06] with the word you see what i'm saying
[1:17:08] and so
[1:17:09] we got to be real careful while we
[1:17:11] aren't going to criticize the individual
[1:17:13] that we don't promote yes
[1:17:16] that's right
[1:17:19] it's a tough position sometimes it it
[1:17:23] it causes a i'll tell you what it'll do
[1:17:25] sometimes it'll take
[1:17:26] grown men and grown women and make them
[1:17:28] so nervous they'll just break out
[1:17:30] cold sweat because these are people they
[1:17:32] know these are people they love you know
[1:17:33] these are people maybe even in their
[1:17:35] church or
[1:17:35] you know i remember one brother i i
[1:17:38] definitely want to hint where this come
[1:17:39] from
[1:17:40] but you know it it was right there his
[1:17:42] own father-in-law that he he
[1:17:44] grew up under and and whatever and one
[1:17:46] day he had to just say look uh
[1:17:47] i can you show me where brother brown
[1:17:49] said this
[1:17:53] his own father-in-law said how dare you
[1:17:55] question me
[1:17:56] see that wasn't the right answer
[1:18:01] that's that's not defending what he
[1:18:04] should be able to as a minister defend
[1:18:09] but i like the second half of this i
[1:18:10] don't want to focus on that too much
[1:18:13] but they that seek the lord understand
[1:18:15] all things
[1:18:17] now in this wonderful my brother and
[1:18:18] sister the scripture says
[1:18:20] that you can't even call him the christ
[1:18:25] without the holy ghost so look how god
[1:18:29] works
[1:18:30] he comes right down here and he puts
[1:18:33] something inside of you and i
[1:18:36] and we start seeking him lord i want to
[1:18:39] know you
[1:18:40] i want to know you in truth i want to
[1:18:42] know you in spirit
[1:18:43] i want to know you lord yes
[1:18:47] and then sometimes they don't even
[1:18:49] realize it
[1:18:51] we start getting the revelation of
[1:18:53] understanding and we start to see in the
[1:18:55] word
[1:18:56] and it starts to come alive to us and
[1:18:59] the more it comes alive to us the more
[1:19:01] of this word
[1:19:02] we understand and then it just starts to
[1:19:05] grow
[1:19:06] starts to grow starts to grow
[1:19:09] and pretty soon it is a full-fledged
[1:19:12] revelation not a man revelation but
[1:19:16] a revealing of jesus christ
[1:19:20] oh hallelujah it makes me so excited
[1:19:22] we're not just message people god sent a
[1:19:24] prophet saints
[1:19:25] we've had the very mystery of jesus
[1:19:27] christ
[1:19:28] open to us in this day it
[1:19:31] is alive and it is well amen the seals
[1:19:34] have been broken
[1:19:36] and god has given us understanding i see
[1:19:39] ears to hear the word is coming into
[1:19:42] full blossom full maturity right before
[1:19:46] us
[1:19:46] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:50] oh my oh my now look as we just keep
[1:19:53] moving along here
[1:19:56] better is the poor that walketh in his
[1:19:59] uprightness then he that is
[1:20:03] perverse in his ways though he be rich
[1:20:08] i think that's pretty self-explanatory
[1:20:10] actually but you know
[1:20:11] i just wanted to kind of bring a little
[1:20:13] light
[1:20:15] you know now i don't know all of us are
[1:20:17] a little different
[1:20:19] i'm a person our house reflects it
[1:20:24] when i work it reflects it
[1:20:27] i'm a person that likes light in the
[1:20:30] natural
[1:20:34] yes sir people sit over there and
[1:20:36] they'll read a book
[1:20:37] and i what are you doing in the dark
[1:20:39] it's not dark in here
[1:20:41] yes it is in my world it's dark in here
[1:20:46] okay we need to put more lights in this
[1:20:48] room
[1:20:49] we're remodeling this house we're
[1:20:51] putting more lights there's so many
[1:20:52] lights in this room that the
[1:20:54] room glows that's good it's just about
[1:20:56] right
[1:20:59] that's just me in the natural
[1:21:04] the way of a true prophet brother
[1:21:06] branham
[1:21:07] i always encourage you saints i
[1:21:10] cherry-pick these things out
[1:21:12] most people won't stand in the pulpit
[1:21:13] and tell you i've just cherry-picked
[1:21:15] this quote
[1:21:16] but the truth of it is if we didn't we'd
[1:21:18] have to read the whole book to you so
[1:21:20] that you could find
[1:21:21] the true understanding of the whole
[1:21:22] thing and then we wouldn't hardly get
[1:21:24] anywhere because we would be reading
[1:21:26] page and page and quote quote quote
[1:21:28] quote so you go
[1:21:29] home and you look before it and you look
[1:21:32] after it but i just love
[1:21:34] this quote and i said the other night it
[1:21:36] seems to be today that the whole church
[1:21:38] is built upon
[1:21:39] the main thing amongst the brethren
[1:21:40] today of the churches
[1:21:42] is numbers numbers one trying to outdo
[1:21:45] the other one
[1:21:46] numbers god don't count
[1:21:49] numbers he counts character
[1:21:53] can someone say thank you lord character
[1:21:56] is what god's
[1:21:58] looking to find somebody he can get his
[1:22:01] hands on now some of us my brother and
[1:22:04] sister
[1:22:05] might be a little overzealous on this
[1:22:08] but
[1:22:09] as i shared sunday we'll go into the
[1:22:11] mercy seat and we'll start dealing with
[1:22:13] this because some people kind of feel
[1:22:14] like
[1:22:15] if god's right here in our midst tonight
[1:22:17] that he must be off the mercy seat but
[1:22:19] i'm sorry i serve an omniscient
[1:22:20] omnipresent god
[1:22:22] amen i serve a god that the word
[1:22:25] opened in our day shows very clearly
[1:22:27] that he is here
[1:22:28] now look this is where people stumble
[1:22:31] it's not just
[1:22:32] in the holy spirit that the spirit is
[1:22:35] upon us
[1:22:36] but you see the word of god is god
[1:22:40] himself and the prophet over and over
[1:22:43] and over again refers to the word in you
[1:22:48] does anybody give me the conclusion of
[1:22:49] what that means
[1:22:52] god's in you god wasn't looking to just
[1:22:56] anoint you in the flesh god was looking
[1:22:58] for a place
[1:22:59] to have a life manifested
[1:23:03] in this day so there is a
[1:23:06] group of believers that are manifesting
[1:23:08] the word of god
[1:23:10] that is the very life of god walking
[1:23:13] on earth today not just an anointing
[1:23:17] on the flesh of the holy spirit but the
[1:23:20] scripture
[1:23:20] says christ in you
[1:23:24] hallelujah so we become that vessel we
[1:23:26] become the hands we become the feet we
[1:23:28] become the voice we become the example
[1:23:30] and we reflect that
[1:23:34] because god's looking to find somebody
[1:23:37] he can get his hands on somebody they'll
[1:23:41] stand still
[1:23:42] long enough okay
[1:23:45] are we good
[1:23:49] so we're not really looking for numbers
[1:23:54] you know my brother and sister i was
[1:23:56] talking to a brother sometime back
[1:23:59] i made a little comment i said brother i
[1:24:01] hear your church is growing
[1:24:04] and there's silence silence sometimes
[1:24:08] can be deafening
[1:24:11] and he makes a little comment with a
[1:24:12] chuckle behind it
[1:24:14] not all growth is good growth
[1:24:19] and no i'm not explaining that okay
[1:24:22] i'll pray for you good we need it
[1:24:26] so look my brother and sister what god's
[1:24:27] looking for
[1:24:29] if we come well look at it this way
[1:24:32] you remember reading the quote where
[1:24:34] brother brown says something's wrong
[1:24:35] when the mayor of the city starts to
[1:24:36] come to your church
[1:24:41] so that's the mayor and we can do that
[1:24:44] but sometimes
[1:24:45] there's people who think they're the
[1:24:46] mayor there's people who are anointed
[1:24:49] act like they're the mayor
[1:24:52] there's people that want to express
[1:24:53] their opinion whether it's ask for or
[1:24:55] not
[1:24:57] and when they come that doesn't always
[1:25:01] mean well doesn't mean we're blessed
[1:25:05] it might be that they bring their money
[1:25:07] believing that's going to change the
[1:25:09] church to be what they want the church
[1:25:11] to be
[1:25:12] but i tell you my brother and sister
[1:25:14] just as it was remember in the scripture
[1:25:16] i i'm i'm i wasn't going to say anything
[1:25:19] about it i really shouldn't but
[1:25:21] i come to church tonight with a migraine
[1:25:23] and i
[1:25:24] i seriously thought about playing a tape
[1:25:26] i thought i have all weekends chris it's
[1:25:28] gone brother david's gone
[1:25:29] and here i am or midweek and i've got a
[1:25:31] migraine and
[1:25:32] and uh well i'll just fast i i had an
[1:25:35] instant migraine today when i
[1:25:36] backed a chopper into the back end of a
[1:25:38] semi trailer and bent it up
[1:25:40] i had an instant migraine
[1:25:44] amazing how that works isn't it
[1:25:48] so you know you look at this and you
[1:25:50] think oh my oh my what what is
[1:25:52] what well look my brother and sister
[1:25:54] what god's doing here
[1:25:56] is he's trying to show us the only thing
[1:25:59] that matters
[1:26:00] rather have this little handful
[1:26:03] of real believers than a great big
[1:26:06] church and a great big program
[1:26:09] of unbelievers and make believers
[1:26:12] we don't want to count numbers let's
[1:26:13] count character let's count character
[1:26:16] let's have courage enough to say lord
[1:26:18] mold my character right that's kind of
[1:26:19] like praying for patience
[1:26:21] it's hard more my character lord well
[1:26:23] the lord says fine i'll mold your
[1:26:25] character i'll let you run into things
[1:26:26] and
[1:26:27] i'll let you do this and i'll let you do
[1:26:28] that and i'll let this happen i'll let
[1:26:30] that happen
[1:26:31] because i'm gonna mold your character
[1:26:32] i'm gonna let this sister say something
[1:26:34] to you
[1:26:35] and you're gonna go home and go oh my
[1:26:36] goodness i i think she just called me or
[1:26:38] said i was like this
[1:26:39] and oh lord i thought she was my friend
[1:26:42] and this brother he's this and
[1:26:43] oh he says and he done this and oh lord
[1:26:45] i feel insulted and what am i gonna do
[1:26:48] and then we pick up our message and
[1:26:50] we're reading and the prophet of god
[1:26:51] says you choose to be offended
[1:26:56] huh yes you choose to be offended
[1:27:04] well if not the devil would just throw
[1:27:06] the spirit of being a thief on you and
[1:27:09] you wouldn't be able to help yourself
[1:27:11] you'd walk out of here tonight and
[1:27:13] you'd go to a walmart kmart this martin
[1:27:15] that martin you just start packing stuff
[1:27:17] out cause you no no it's a decision
[1:27:21] so is character lord mold me
[1:27:25] mold me into your i want to be your
[1:27:27] character
[1:27:29] now let's close with this right here
[1:27:31] because you see somebody's got to stand
[1:27:32] still let the word of god move
[1:27:35] now i like this right here closing
[1:27:37] sister emmy would you come
[1:27:44] i hope we can say amen to this tonight
[1:27:49] your character is god's character
[1:27:55] what is it a little pushover
[1:28:05] saints now don't think i'm complaining
[1:28:06] but i want to give an example i've had
[1:28:08] people tell me
[1:28:12] the prophet of god said not to argue
[1:28:13] over the word and you're arguing
[1:28:17] no actually i i wasn't arguing
[1:28:21] because if you think i was arguing you
[1:28:23] don't really know me because i
[1:28:25] get pretty intense when i argue
[1:28:29] i'm not proud of that but if we're going
[1:28:31] to step over in that realm i can get
[1:28:32] pretty intense
[1:28:34] but you see my brother and sister
[1:28:38] i'm not a pushover
[1:28:42] the older i get the less of a pushover i
[1:28:45] am
[1:28:46] no sir if god is a god of judgment he is
[1:28:49] a god of
[1:28:50] correct it must be on the line nothing
[1:28:53] else will do that's the kind of
[1:28:55] character you are because you're the
[1:28:58] character
[1:28:59] of your father see see that's why we as
[1:29:02] a church aren't going to compromise to
[1:29:03] grow
[1:29:04] we're not going to compromise to
[1:29:06] accomplish this or
[1:29:08] compromise to accomplish that or
[1:29:10] compromise to be known
[1:29:14] you see my brother and sister because
[1:29:15] when it really comes down to it
[1:29:19] when it really really really comes down
[1:29:21] to it
[1:29:23] we
[1:29:27] that's why we should highlight things
[1:29:31] [Music]
[1:29:36] well maybe i no here we are there we are
[1:29:40] going back to verse four
[1:29:44] well you don't have to put it on screen
[1:29:45] they that forsake the law
[1:29:47] praise the wicked but such as keep the
[1:29:50] law
[1:29:51] contend with them
[1:29:54] contend is to take position
[1:29:58] in an argument
[1:30:01] you see saints we weren't called to give
[1:30:04] falsehoods free reign we were called to
[1:30:08] stand sure upon the word of god
[1:30:11] and to declare it that's one of the
[1:30:12] reasons they didn't like brother brown's
[1:30:14] ministry
[1:30:15] because he took this spirit of
[1:30:17] denomination and he took it right
[1:30:20] back he didn't call the people he didn't
[1:30:22] say you're a devil you're a devil you're
[1:30:23] a devil
[1:30:24] in fact jesus was much more blunt when
[1:30:27] he spoke to them and said ye of
[1:30:29] your father the devil but brother
[1:30:33] branham they were angry with him because
[1:30:35] there he was he took the spirit or where
[1:30:38] the nomination come from and he took it
[1:30:41] right back and
[1:30:42] showed them where that seed sprouted
[1:30:47] now do you understand what's happening
[1:30:48] in the day we live in
[1:30:50] god's called you and i not to give free
[1:30:53] reign
[1:30:54] to these things but to stand and say we
[1:30:57] know where the spirit of that
[1:30:59] came from now people say that's you're
[1:31:03] you're angry you're bitter you're this
[1:31:05] no saints we're not we're not we either
[1:31:08] stand on the word of god or we
[1:31:10] compromise
[1:31:11] it's that simple and so what is this god
[1:31:14] brings life lessons to us
[1:31:17] you wonder why sometimes you find
[1:31:19] yourself caught up in a little turmoil
[1:31:21] and you wonder lord why or how did this
[1:31:23] happen you realize there's always a
[1:31:25] lesson in that stop
[1:31:27] don't look at the trial itself my
[1:31:30] brother and sister
[1:31:31] don't look at the trial i'm just going
[1:31:33] to use a silly example
[1:31:34] the wheels fall off the wagon oh lord
[1:31:38] why did the wheels fall off the wagon
[1:31:40] why don't you stop
[1:31:41] and say lord there's got to be a reason
[1:31:45] the wheels fell off the wagon
[1:31:49] maybe i need patience maybe i need to
[1:31:52] learn to pray
[1:31:54] maybe someone will come along and god
[1:31:57] will anoint them
[1:31:58] to help you that they might receive a
[1:32:01] blessing
[1:32:02] for helping the bride of christ don't
[1:32:05] stop and say lord
[1:32:06] you don't love me today lord you know
[1:32:08] why why why
[1:32:10] oh i know what it is i know what it is
[1:32:12] this little catholic spirit on me
[1:32:14] about 10 weeks ago i kind of went
[1:32:18] and now the lord's punishing me for that
[1:32:21] seriously

[1:32:35] character hallelujah
