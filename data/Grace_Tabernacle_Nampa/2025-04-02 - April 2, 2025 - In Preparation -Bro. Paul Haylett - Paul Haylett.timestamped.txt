[7:51] Having no burdens to bear.
[7:57] Wely singing with heart bells all
[8:01] ringing. Oh, won't it be wonderful
[8:08] there? Won't it be wonderful

[8:20] bear, joyously singing with heartbells
[8:25] all ringing. Oh, won't it be wonderful
[8:33] there?
[8:38] Amen. Did you get my text, Ivan?
[8:42] Okay. Sorry. I knew I knew the screen
[8:44] was going to do that. We had some bugs
[8:46] before service that we had to squash.
[8:48] So, amen. It's good to be here tonight.
[8:52] Amen. God bless each one of you. I'd
[8:55] like to start with
[8:57] um number 276. I just came to

[9:02] this
[9:03] evening. Amen.
[9:08] I just came to
[9:12] glorify
[9:14] glorify your
[9:19] name. I just came to
[9:23] glorify

[11:19] name.
[11:21] Amen. I didn't write that number down,
[11:23] Ivan, but uh justified.
[11:36] I was sitting alone and wondering about
[11:40] what I'm supposed to do. I can't deny
[11:45] the times I've made mistakes. I've met
[11:49] from him. He
[11:52] knew. But I know that deep within my
[11:56] soul I feel sorry. honest I
[12:00] do. So I just cry and say forgive me
[12:05] Lord. Forgive me Lord. Will
[12:11] you
[12:12] [Music]
[12:15] justify?
[12:19] Justified. I have not done it in the
[12:23] first place. Justified.
[12:26] [Music]
[12:32] Justified.
[12:37] Justified. Have not done it in the first
[12:41] place. You
[12:45] justify. He looked at your perfect
[12:49] picture without spot or a wrinkle.
[12:55] He didn't look at you where you are now.
[12:59] He looked from
[13:02] eternity. He said, "You just trapped in
[13:05] that body. You bypassed your
[13:10] theophony. You have not done it in the
[13:14] first place. You justified.
[13:17] [Music]
[13:23] Justified.
[13:27] Justified. You have not done it in the
[13:31] first place. You're
[13:36] justified.
[13:40] Justified.

[14:30] tune for some
[14:32] reason.
[14:34] Jesus paid it all.
[14:39] All to him I
[14:43] own.
[14:45] Sin had left a crimson
[14:50] stain. He
[14:53] washed it white as snow.
[14:59] I
[15:00] hear the Savior
[15:03] say, "Thy
[15:06] strength indeed is
[15:09] small. Child of
[15:12] weakness, watch and
[15:15] pray. Find in
[15:18] me thine all in all."
[15:22] [Music]
[15:24] Jesus paid it
[15:28] all. All to him I
[15:34] own. Sin had left a crimson
[15:41] stain. He
[15:43] washed it white as snow.
[15:47] [Music]
[15:50] Lord

[15:54] find thy
[15:56] power and thine
[15:59] alone can wash my garments
[16:05] white in the
[16:07] blood of Calvar's
[16:12] lamb.
[16:13] Jesus paid it all.
[16:18] All to him I
[16:23] own. Sin had left a crimson
[16:30] stain. He
[16:32] washed it white as
[16:36] snow.
[16:38] Jesus paid it all.
[16:43] All to him I
[16:48] own. Sin had left a crimson
[16:55] stain. He
[16:57] washed it white as
[17:02] snow.
[17:05] Amen.
[17:10] Amen. Let's just stand. I did like to
[17:12] sing
[17:15] um some
[17:17] reason just before I got into service,
[17:20] blessed assurance came on my heart and I
[17:22] feel like singing that tonight.
[17:27] Amen. Jesus is mine. Oh, what a
[17:30] foretaste of glory divine. Amen.

[24:27] the outcome because we know it'll be
[24:29] exactly as it's supposed to

[26:48] [Music]
[26:52] Though my life on earth may never be a
[26:55] spectacle to
[26:58] see, honored as a great man, no, I never
[27:02] thought I'd
[27:04] be. It really doesn't matter till at the
[27:09] end I stand.
[27:12] only ever always Lord. My life is in
[27:18] your
[27:21] hands. It's only ever always Lord I give
[27:25] myself to thee. It's only ever always
[27:29] Lord throughout
[27:31] eternity. It's only ever always Lord
[27:34] till at the end I stand.
[27:38] and only ever always. Lord, my life is
[27:45] in your
[27:48] hands. Defeat is turned to victory and
[27:52] shame to honor there. And standing in
[27:55] your presence, Lord, a child from earth
[27:58] you spare. The crushing pain, the awful
[28:02] shame that at the cross you bore. It's
[28:06] only ever always, Lord. This life I live
[28:12] is
[28:15] yours. It's only ever always, Lord. I
[28:18] give myself to thee. It's only, ever,
[28:22] always, Lord. Throughout
[28:25] eternity, it's only, ever, always, Lord,
[28:28] till at the end I stand.
[28:32] and only ever always. Lord, my life is
[28:38] in your
[28:41] hands. Now returning back to us the veil
[28:45] you've rent apart to
[28:49] captivate and captivate our hearts. As
[28:53] Enoch walked, now we shall walk from
[28:56] this world away.
[28:59] and only ever always Lord. With you I'll
[29:05] ever
[29:08] stay. Yes. It's only ever always Lord I
[29:12] give myself to thee. It's only ever
[29:16] always Lord throughout
[29:18] eternity. It's only ever always Lord
[29:22] till at the end I stand.
[29:25] only ever always Lord my life is in your
[29:33] hand. It's only ever always Lord I give
[29:37] myself to thee. It's only ever always
[29:41] Lord throughout
[29:43] eternity. It's only ever always Lord
[29:46] till at the end I stand.
[29:50] only ever always. Lord, my life is in
[29:59] your hands.
[30:17] Amen. Amen. My life is in your hands.
[30:21] It's all we can do is dedicate our life
[30:23] into his hands. He's said he's got a way
[30:25] for us. He's got a plan for us. Praise
[30:28] the Lord. Amen. As we get ready to
[30:30] change the order of the service tonight,
[30:31] I'd like to sing that little chorus.
[30:35] Um, let's see
[30:39] here. Number 348, Just Beyond the Veil.
[30:45] [Music]
[30:49] Just beyond the
[30:54] veil, I long to see your
[31:00] face. Just to see your beauty
[31:06] there, just beyond the
[31:12] veil. And you're the prince of peace.
[31:19] You're the prince of
[31:24] peace. You're the prince of peace. You
[31:30] are. You're the prince of
[31:36] peace. Be
[31:38] beautiful. You are.
[31:44] Beautiful you
[31:48] are.
[31:50] Beautiful you are. You
[31:54] are
[31:56] beautiful. You
[32:00] are just beyond the
[32:03] [Music]
[32:05] veil. I long to see your face.
[32:13] Just to see your beauty
[32:18] there just beyond the
[32:24] veil.
[32:26] Beautiful you
[32:30] are.
[32:32] Beautiful you
[32:36] are.
[32:38] Beautiful you are. You
[32:41] are
[32:43] beautiful. You
[32:47] are just beyond the
[32:53] veil. I long to see your face.
[33:01] Just to see your beauty
[33:05] there just beyond the
[33:11] [Music]
[33:20] veil. Just have to say amen. Much
[33:24] louder. Amen. Good to be in the house of
[33:27] the Lord tonight though. God is so good
[33:31] to us. He never said that the numbers
[33:35] would matter. Just the reference of two
[33:37] or three. So that gets down to where
[33:40] just almost the smallest of u handful.
[33:45] He said he'd be here. And I thank the
[33:47] Lord for that. Amen. We want to remember
[33:50] that after the Sunday service there will
[33:53] be a potluck here at the church and uh
[33:57] also there's going to be uh those
[34:00] traveling we want to definitely lift
[34:02] them up in prayer uh and uh also prayers
[34:06] for our brother Rap uh as he will be
[34:09] flying uh Friday afternoon arriving here
[34:12] in Boisey fairly late. We just want the
[34:15] Lord just give him traveling mercies and
[34:18] uh bless his family as he's away from
[34:21] them. Amen. I want to speak to you for a
[34:24] few minutes tonight on the topic of in
[34:27] preparation and uh I have some other
[34:30] words. Thank you. God bless you.
[34:32] Appreciate the musicians song leading.
[34:36] Amen. Uh we have to just look what we're
[34:40] in preparation for and and we won't go
[34:42] into it tonight. I don't know exactly
[34:44] how this will unfold, but you know, the
[34:48] Lord is preparing us uh for peace, but
[34:52] he's also preparing us for war. And um
[34:55] so if we would just stand for the
[34:57] reading of the word, turn in our Bibles
[34:59] to Proverbs 16th chapter, verses
[35:02] 1-9. And um I just uh trust tonight that
[35:06] there'll be a little something just
[35:08] blesses your heart. Amen.
[35:12] Proverbs 16:es
[35:16] 1-9. The preparations of the heart in
[35:20] man, and the answer of the tongue is
[35:23] from the
[35:24] Lord.
[35:26] Always all the ways of a man are clean
[35:29] in his own eyes, but the Lord wayth the
[35:32] spirits. Commit thy works unto the Lord,
[35:35] and thy thoughts shall be established.
[35:37] The Lord hath made all things for
[35:39] himself. Yay, even the wicked for the
[35:42] day of evil. Everyone that is proud in
[35:45] heart in his abomination to the Lord,
[35:48] though hand join in hand, he shall not
[35:51] be unpunished. By mercy and truth,
[35:54] iniquity is purged. And by fear of the
[35:57] Lord, men depart from evil. When a man's
[36:00] ways please the Lord, he maketh even his
[36:03] enemies to be at peace with him.
[36:07] Better is a little with righteousness
[36:10] than great revenue without right. A
[36:13] man's heart deiseth his way, but the
[36:16] Lord directth his steps. Lord, we just
[36:19] ask for your blessing upon the word
[36:21] tonight. Bless each and everyone, those
[36:23] not here, those Lord that are here.
[36:26] Father, touch each heart. We pray in the
[36:28] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[36:33] seated. Yeah. I just find
[36:36] this scripture here in Proverbs to be uh
[36:40] such a a a interesting and beautiful bit
[36:42] of of um scripture like verse three,
[36:45] commit thy works unto the Lord and thy
[36:47] thoughts shall be established. And you
[36:50] know, sometimes I think that it's
[36:52] without a a 100% conviction that our
[36:56] thoughts uh sometimes just become very
[36:59] difficult. They're kind of scrambled,
[37:00] you might say. And and sometimes we got
[37:03] to just stop and say, "Lord, this is the
[37:05] day that you have given. This is the day
[37:08] that you called me to live in." And uh
[37:10] Lord, I want this day to be a day that
[37:12] brings glory to you. I don't want it to
[37:14] be a a day that I would can't wait for
[37:17] the sun to go down. And I'm sure each
[37:19] one of us has probably had a day like
[37:21] that, uh we just kind of wish that it
[37:23] would be over. But uh if we just commit
[37:26] ourselves, uh to the Lord and let our
[37:29] thoughts be established. Amen. Because
[37:32] you see, we're here to serve God. The
[37:35] whole reason and purpose of being that
[37:37] we have is that not not here just to
[37:40] live out some half-hearted life, but
[37:43] he's called us to live out the gospel,
[37:45] which is actually such a beautiful and
[37:48] glorious calling that he has placed upon
[37:50] us. It is not something to to be sore or
[37:54] loath, but to be able to say, "Thank
[37:56] you, Lord, for placing this in my heart,
[37:59] in my life." that I could uh I could
[38:02] desire to serve you. And we look at the
[38:04] world today, my brother and sister. It
[38:07] is there that uh I I I think that it's
[38:11] so interesting uh how that uh verse four
[38:15] uh is very clear he's made all things
[38:18] for himself, even the wicked for the day
[38:20] of evil. And you know sometimes it's
[38:23] just a little hard to grasp that that
[38:25] but God said you know um there's going
[38:27] to be those the righteous and and they
[38:30] are being judged by the word each and
[38:31] every day and there's the unrighteous
[38:34] and they will come to a time that they
[38:36] they don't even want to face judgment.
[38:39] It's a very common term in the time that
[38:41] we live in where people say hey the
[38:43] scripture says don't judge me. But
[38:46] that's because God called them to judge
[38:48] themselves. But they will not judge
[38:50] themselves and they will find the time
[38:52] will come that judgment will come upon
[38:55] them. Now we know we make plans and and
[39:00] u you know I don't usually like write
[39:02] them down but I I make a many plans
[39:05] looking out far into my future. And uh
[39:09] we make those plans but as the scripture
[39:12] says the the Lord is the director of
[39:14] those plans. So, you know, we should
[39:17] always include in in our plans when we
[39:21] express them, when we speak these things
[39:23] out, we really should take what the
[39:25] scripture said and always put Lord
[39:28] willing into our our uh vocabulary, into
[39:32] our conversation to basically say, Lord,
[39:35] it's what you would desire is what I
[39:38] would like to have take place. I I don't
[39:41] want to push into something uh that uh
[39:43] would would uh maybe materially bless me
[39:47] but yet find that I am ultimately out of
[39:50] the will of God. So I I encourage each
[39:53] and everyone that we would just put Lord
[39:55] willing into our conversation and uh
[39:58] then abide by that. If God opens a door
[40:01] uh you know step through that. If he
[40:03] closes a door don't pry it open. Amen.
[40:07] And you know, it's uh I I know that it's
[40:09] sometimes we just feel like, "Oh, surely
[40:11] this is what should happen." But it's
[40:13] not always that way. Amen. Sometimes the
[40:16] Lord, it's not even the wrong thing.
[40:18] It's just the wrong timing that is
[40:21] taking place. In Psalms 144:es 1-3, it
[40:26] says, "Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
[40:29] which teacheth my hands to war, and my
[40:32] fingers to fight, my goodness, and my
[40:36] fortress, my high tower, my deliverer,
[40:39] my shield, and he in whom I trust, who
[40:43] subdueth my people under me." Lord, what
[40:46] is man that thou takest knowledge of
[40:49] him? or the son of man that thou makest
[40:52] account of him. And we'll look at this
[40:55] and taking these first uh verse there.
[40:58] Uh we'll look at that the Lord is
[41:01] actually teaching you and I how to
[41:04] engage in warfare and uh it it not at
[41:07] this point here in the conversation but
[41:10] not not teaching us how to use a gun or
[41:13] a knife, a sword or a spear, but we're
[41:16] putting our hands to the word. We're
[41:19] putting our hands uh to the things of
[41:21] God. And it it is not u my brother and
[41:24] sister, as the scripture says, against
[41:26] flesh and blood, but it's against
[41:28] principalities and powers of darkness.
[41:31] And we're living in an hour that
[41:33] certainly as it comes to the culmination
[41:35] of the word uh for this age that we're
[41:38] seeing that that uh the enemy has become
[41:40] so clever. He has studied us for ages.
[41:44] And he knows just exactly how to come
[41:47] and and to anoint us to put
[41:50] circumstances in our way to to cause us
[41:53] to react in a certain fashion. But the
[41:56] Lord is teaching us. And we can say,
[41:58] well, I I I have fallen under that. I
[42:01] I've been anointed. I I've uh you know,
[42:03] got under a little spirit and and you
[42:06] know, I started to speak negative and I
[42:08] do these things. But you see what God's
[42:11] doing is slowly teaching us how to
[42:14] handle the word of God, how to dig in
[42:17] and how to fight correctly because it is
[42:20] not flesh and blood. It won't do any
[42:21] good to behave like flesh and blood, but
[42:24] to stand on the word of God because he
[42:27] is every bit of goodness. Verse two,
[42:29] that we have and he is our fortress, our
[42:32] high tower, and he is our deliverer.
[42:35] Without him, my brother and sister,
[42:38] Satan would overcome us. But he, the
[42:41] word in us, we shall prevail. Can
[42:44] someone agree with me tonight? Amen.
[42:47] Now, we're looking as we would look into
[42:50] the world news today uh or any of these
[42:53] recent days. And the world news is
[42:56] telling of all these nations that are
[42:59] working in preparing for war. And uh
[43:02] we're we're seeing nations that that
[43:05] have not really thought about war since
[43:08] uh World War II. They haven't really
[43:10] focused on that. They've let their
[43:12] infrastructure fall down. They're doing
[43:15] and suddenly they're realizing my the
[43:17] the dark clouds of war are on the
[43:20] horizon and and they're deciding to to
[43:23] prepare for that. Uh just read a little
[43:25] article u you know where they're they're
[43:28] going into uh um the the uh uh
[43:34] security of their of their military
[43:36] might you might say and they're moving
[43:38] it inside the tunnels under the rocks
[43:40] out of sight because they're afraid of
[43:43] this. And you see what's happened. Maybe
[43:45] not to us here so much, but the eyes of
[43:48] the world are focused on this global
[43:51] superpowers and what they're doing and
[43:53] and what is China doing and what is is
[43:56] Russia and what's the United States and
[43:59] what are they all doing. But remember,
[44:02] they are already prophesied of what they
[44:05] are. So our preparation as sons and
[44:08] daughters of God does not have to do
[44:10] with steel and concrete and tunnels and
[44:14] refuge is in the rock. But our refuge is
[44:16] in Jesus Christ. And and our preparation
[44:19] is in Jesus Christ. And and the
[44:22] superpowers, they're prophesied to do
[44:24] what they're prophesied to do. And my
[44:26] brother and sister, we are standing here
[44:29] today. Uh we are looking and we're
[44:31] seeing these things, these prophecies
[44:33] coming to pass. And uh you know the
[44:36] superpowers, yes, the world is you might
[44:39] say shaking. Uh China having such a navy
[44:43] and a force completely putting a force
[44:46] surrounding in a great circle around
[44:48] Taiwan and sending the message to them
[44:50] anytime we please. And so it's there
[44:53] that that there's this confrontation
[44:55] taking place. But while they're looking
[44:58] at the natural, God's called you and I
[45:00] to look to the spiritual. He's called
[45:03] you and I to come and and to realize
[45:06] that Satan is the economy might affect
[45:10] you, but we weren't called to worry
[45:12] about the natural side of it. Satan is
[45:15] attacking in the spiritual realm, my
[45:18] brother and sister. And and we look at
[45:20] this and see how that Job Job was there
[45:25] living for the Lord. Amen. God spoke
[45:28] these words over Job that we know
[45:30] exactly what God thought about him. He
[45:32] thought he was a perfect man, but he
[45:35] allowed this and these things took place
[45:37] and and the attack on Job starts in the
[45:41] flesh. And then in the flesh realm when
[45:44] it is under it's being buffeted it's
[45:47] under such a burden that then it's the
[45:50] good friends the fellow church member
[45:52] you might say that come and started to
[45:54] come into the spiritual side and trying
[45:57] to imply that Job must have done
[46:00] something wrong to to be in such a a
[46:03] situation. But my brother and sister God
[46:06] is not making he heals us. Amen. He he
[46:09] protects us, but he is not making
[46:12] concession to preserve our flesh. He's
[46:15] not saying, you know what, I I need to
[46:17] keep them all, you know, a handful of
[46:19] vitamins and and all of this to never
[46:22] allow these things, you know, to to
[46:24] touch them, never catch a cold or the
[46:26] flu. He He's not looking at the flesh in
[46:29] that sense, but it's the spiritual
[46:32] center. That's what God is looking to.
[46:34] And he's looking at your spiritual
[46:36] center, my spiritual center tonight.
[46:38] That's what he's really putting. The
[46:40] scripture doesn't even give real solid
[46:43] evidence or reference to what this body
[46:47] is
[46:48] worth. But remember what the prophet
[46:50] said. He brought it out in clarity that
[46:53] our bodies were worth. It varied over
[46:56] time because of the elements. But my
[46:58] brother and sister be hardpressed even
[47:00] with inflation to get more than five
[47:02] bucks out of a body. Amen. So not much
[47:05] value there. I mean we we pamper these
[47:08] do bodies pretty good or try to anyway,
[47:11] you know, and we we we think a lot of
[47:13] our body, but you know, Satan will
[47:16] attack our physical being, but it's not
[47:19] his goal. He's not here to attack our
[47:22] physical side, but he is here, his
[47:25] preparation is to bring you in a
[47:27] physical realm where you feel betrayed,
[47:30] let down, you feel discouraged, you feel
[47:33] unable, and then he starts to work onto
[47:36] the spiritual realm, the spiritual
[47:38] center. You know, brother Brandham, once
[47:41] again, I say emphasize what this flesh
[47:43] is worth. But you know, my brother and
[47:46] sister, while it looks like Satan is is
[47:49] attacking our flesh, his attack is
[47:52] veiled in the spiritual realm. He's
[47:55] attacking the soul. There's where the
[47:57] value is. That's the only place that you
[48:00] and I have intrinsic value tonight. An
[48:03] organic value that is there is we are
[48:05] sons and daughters of God. And the word
[48:08] of God said that one soul's worth 10,000
[48:11] worlds. And if one body is only worth a
[48:13] few bucks, my brother and sister, it's
[48:15] not even in the same chart, the same
[48:17] comparison. So the word is showing us
[48:20] this intrinsic value of who we are. And
[48:25] Satan wants to come and buffet us. And
[48:28] and I I know we're probably quiet
[48:30] tonight, but that's fine. But I can
[48:32] assure you that the times that you felt
[48:34] as though that you were a failure as a
[48:37] Christian, that was not God. That's not
[48:39] the Holy Spirit trying to move upon you
[48:41] to let you know that you are failure.
[48:44] And that is Satan attacking you in that
[48:47] realm to get you to a place that you uh
[48:50] then lower your guard because you feel
[48:52] like you are valueless. But God never
[48:56] took away his word and his word said
[49:00] your soul is worth 10,000 worlds. And so
[49:04] if God put it in print, you know,
[49:06] there's many things, you know, as
[49:07] brother Brandham an example, you know,
[49:09] they were they were saying uh about
[49:11] baptismal Holy Ghost and some of these
[49:14] other things. And and you know, they
[49:16] said, "Well, we're not living uh under
[49:18] these things. We're now under grace and
[49:21] we're moved on." And brother Brandham's
[49:23] comment to them was, "I uh I can show
[49:26] you where God put it in. Can you show me
[49:28] where he took it out?"
[49:30] And so we look at that and realize that
[49:32] Satan is very clever to try to get us to
[49:36] come to the place that it isn't the
[49:38] devil actually eliminating this from our
[49:41] lives, but it is us allowing ourselves
[49:45] to decrease the value to come. And that
[49:49] is not the preparation that God has for
[49:52] sons and daughters of God to a rapture.
[49:54] He's not looking for us to come to the
[49:56] rapture as beggars. He is not looking at
[49:58] us to come as weaklings, as uh sissies.
[50:02] We're to come here uh boldly before the
[50:06] throne of God. Which means that we have
[50:08] to hold to the word of God. Our part of
[50:11] our preparation is not how spiritual we
[50:14] can get, but how that we can embrace the
[50:18] word and claim the word and not move
[50:20] from that. Now remember the story
[50:22] brother Brandham tells about the the uh
[50:25] the road and the chariots and one
[50:27] boasting how close he can drive to the
[50:31] edge. He can just run his tire of his
[50:33] chariot right down that edge. Another
[50:36] one says, "Oh, over here against the
[50:38] wall. I can drive with this just mere
[50:40] inches of the wall at a full gallop."
[50:43] And one of the young men says, "Hey, I
[50:46] like to stay just right in the center."
[50:49] My brother and sister, that wasn't just
[50:51] a story about horses and chariots and
[50:53] bravery. That was a story. That was a
[50:56] principle laid out to stay in the center
[50:59] of the road and and not flirt with the
[51:02] the adrenaline rush as it were be of
[51:05] being next to the cliff or next to the
[51:07] wall. But we have to realize that the
[51:10] word has come as an intrinsic value to
[51:12] you and I. In other words, an organic
[51:15] very present useful. Amen. That is what
[51:19] the word is to you and I today. And so
[51:22] everything around us today, whether it's
[51:24] from our music, our clothes, attitudes,
[51:28] all of these things, Satan is using
[51:31] things there to try to cause us to pull
[51:35] back from what the word has already
[51:37] placed in our life and and placed in the
[51:40] doctrines, the gospel, the message of
[51:42] the hour. My brother and sister, let's
[51:44] not let the message of the hour turn
[51:46] into a cliche, but let it be what our
[51:49] life actually is reflected by. And it's
[51:52] there that we look at that every time
[51:55] that something comes up against these
[51:57] things. Satan is not worried. He doesn't
[52:00] care. Now, pardon me from saying it this
[52:03] way. Satan doesn't really care. Amen.
[52:06] How well we look.
[52:10] What he cares about is not even what we
[52:13] declare I believe this. What he cares
[52:16] about is how fervent you hold to what
[52:21] you claim you believe. And we we don't
[52:24] want to come to a place that we just
[52:26] hold it as just a a a little something
[52:29] out there that this is what we believe.
[52:31] This is the way I was raised. Uh uh you
[52:34] know it's not just like well you know
[52:36] our family this is who we are. my
[52:39] brother and sister, that's really not
[52:41] what it is. That that's
[52:43] irrelevant. It all comes down to. Now,
[52:46] look how Satan's veiled attack on the
[52:49] bride of Christ. I just was in a
[52:51] conversation with a fellow minister.
[52:53] He's from back east and um you know, he
[52:57] was telling me, he said, "I I uh we have
[52:59] a situation in our area.
[53:03] uh a lot of people who don't believe in
[53:05] ministry, they they want to just listen
[53:08] to tapes and and uh the only reason they
[53:11] listen to our church services is to find
[53:13] something to criticize. And my brother
[53:16] and sister, these kind of attacks uh are
[53:19] are really uh we should be able to come
[53:22] to a place we say, you know what, that's
[53:24] illrelevant. I don't care what they say
[53:26] about me. Because if we are centered in
[53:28] the word, if we are centered in this
[53:31] message, then they're not really
[53:33] attacking you and I. You know, it's a if
[53:36] they're calling you a holy roller that
[53:38] what would they called Jesus Christ?
[53:40] Amen. What would they have actually in
[53:42] this day and age called the prophet if
[53:44] they think that we are holding to these
[53:46] things? But it's there that it
[53:49] ultimately comes down to Satan is
[53:51] attacking the word and the word is in
[53:53] you.
[53:55] So don't get confused that they're
[53:56] attacking you. They're actually
[53:59] attacking the word. Now, they won't say
[54:02] they don't believe
[54:04] it. They just attack it by scripture, by
[54:09] interpretation, by
[54:11] reputation. But ultimately, the real
[54:13] truth of it
[54:15] is they're attacking the word. Don't
[54:18] take it personal. Don't let Satan get
[54:21] under your skin about this because the
[54:24] word in you is what is directing you. It
[54:28] is not man's opinion. It's not even a
[54:31] church opinion, not a pastor opinion, my
[54:34] brother and sister. The only opinion
[54:36] that matters is that we can stand before
[54:38] our Lord Jesus one day and he says,
[54:40] "Well done, my good and faithful
[54:42] servant." We're not going to look back
[54:44] and say, "Oh, this makes this feel
[54:46] better and that feels better." That is
[54:48] the ultimate culmination of what we are
[54:52] searching for is to hear his voice say,
[54:55] "Well done, my good and faithful
[54:58] servant."
[55:05] Amen. Let's uh turn into Greatest Battle
[55:09] Ever Fought. Um very short quote here,
[55:14] but I thought it was very good.
[55:17] Greatest battle ever fought. Brother
[55:18] Brandham says this. See his attack.
[55:20] Watch. Listen close. This closing. His
[55:23] attack is
[55:25] what? Disbelieve God's word. So that's
[55:29] all Satan's attack is actually about is
[55:31] to just get you to disbelieve. He's not
[55:34] really caring about the collateral
[55:36] damage as it were. It's just if he can
[55:39] get you to disbelieve God's word. That's
[55:43] his attack there. Can you see the
[55:45] greatest battle was ever fought? There's
[55:48] only two forces, Satan and God. What is
[55:51] Satan's weapon against
[55:53] you? Is to try to get you to
[55:57] disbelieve your
[55:59] weapon. Now, if we will recognize this,
[56:03] what is being brought right here, our
[56:05] weapon is the word. So, if we get to the
[56:09] place that we don't trust the word, then
[56:12] Satan has got us to disbelieve his
[56:15] weapon. He disarms
[56:17] you. Let's listen real quiet now.
[56:20] Listen. If he can get you to disbelieve
[56:23] your weapon is equivalent, if he gets
[56:26] you to believe that your weapon is not
[56:29] strong enough, he has disarmed you.
[56:35] Now this is a quotation my brother and
[56:37] sister that is of of a me another man's
[56:43] comment. He makes this statement and he
[56:47] says they won't out and out say they
[56:50] don't
[56:52] believe. They just say we disagree.
[56:58] How can we
[57:01] disagree with the
[57:04] word? It's nothing less than
[57:08] unbelief. They have come to the place
[57:11] they have no confidence in their
[57:16] weapon. And that's what Satan desires to
[57:20] do. I want to read part of this quote
[57:22] again. Is to try to get you to
[57:24] disbelieve your weapon. He disarms you.
[57:28] Let's listen real quiet now. Listen. If
[57:31] he can get you to disbelieve your weapon
[57:34] is
[57:35] equivalent. If he gets you to believe
[57:37] that your weapon is not strong enough,
[57:41] he has disarmed
[57:43] you. So, we see how subtile Satan is to
[57:47] come and get people to come and say, "I
[57:50] question what the prophet said here. I
[57:52] disagree with how he put it here. And I
[57:55] I think that he put it too strongly
[57:57] here. You see what he's doing is he's
[58:00] convincing them that their weapon is not
[58:03] equal to or adequate. And when that
[58:06] happens, he's disarmed them. My brother
[58:09] and sister, there is where Satan coming
[58:12] so clever that he is coming in in any
[58:17] way that he can come in and uh it would
[58:20] be there that that if he can just get us
[58:22] to start doubting little things then we
[58:25] will find we have no confidence at all.
[58:28] Let's turn Ephesians the 6th
[58:32] chapter verses 10-
[58:36] 18. So you see here in Ephesians what
[58:39] this is is how that
[58:43] we can fight against uh Satan trying to
[58:47] disarm us trying to come in so subtly to
[58:52] cause us to question to think that the
[58:55] message is not sufficient. Uh this is
[58:59] this is where we come back to and and
[59:02] we'll find that it is the word. See, we
[59:04] don't have to go somewhere else into
[59:06] someone else's reference or quotes or
[59:08] whatever it it is the word. Ephesians
[59:12] 6:10-18. Finally, my brethren, be strong
[59:16] in the Lord and in the power of his
[59:20] might. Now, if we think the message has
[59:22] come to a place that it's
[59:24] powerless, then we'll find right here
[59:27] that we are not holding in the power or
[59:31] confidence in the power of his might.
[59:33] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[59:36] may be able to stand against the ws of
[59:39] the devil. So Satan's preparation that
[59:42] he's been preparing for several thousand
[59:45] years is to bring people to a place that
[59:48] the circumstance of their life disagrees
[59:52] with the word and they end up choosing
[59:55] their circumstance over the
[59:58] word. So you'll see that Satan's already
[1:00:00] accomplished the work when he does that.
[1:00:03] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:00:04] may be able to stand against the ws of
[1:00:06] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:00:09] flesh and blood, but against
[1:00:11] principalities, against powers, against
[1:00:13] the rulers of darkness of this world,
[1:00:16] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:00:20] places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:00:23] whole armor of God. Now, to take unto
[1:00:26] you is not to put it on a shelf. It is
[1:00:30] not to leave it in the armory room, but
[1:00:34] it is to have it with you surrounding
[1:00:38] you. You've put it on. It's become a
[1:00:41] part of you that you may be able to
[1:00:44] stand the evil day and have done all to
[1:00:48] stand. Stand therefore. Now, I know that
[1:00:52] there's a lot of history that shows a
[1:00:54] lot of days, a lot of time that was
[1:00:56] evil, but the whole word of God points
[1:00:59] that this day that we're living in, this
[1:01:01] time is the most deceptive of all ages.
[1:01:04] Is that not what the prophet taught us?
[1:01:07] And so it's there that as being one of
[1:01:09] the most deceptive times that it's there
[1:01:12] that we'll find that Satan having done
[1:01:16] all he can do will come to the point it
[1:01:19] won't be Satan that topples you or I
[1:01:23] will be the fact that we did not put on
[1:01:26] the whole armor. So it comes down to
[1:01:29] people say well the devil made me do it
[1:01:32] but my brother and sister the devil
[1:01:34] didn't do it. He just created an
[1:01:36] atmosphere in preparation for us to come
[1:01:39] to a place that we're not willing to do
[1:01:41] it. We're not willing to stand on the
[1:01:43] word. We're not really willing to
[1:01:45] embrace it wholeheartedly without
[1:01:48] reservation. And and so Satan, you know,
[1:01:51] I I think I've said this before. I think
[1:01:53] he's probably outside many churches
[1:01:55] crying because he's getting blamed for
[1:01:57] what the people did to
[1:02:00] themselves. That was a quiet response.
[1:02:05] Amen. You may be able to withstand in
[1:02:08] the evil day and having done all to
[1:02:10] stand done all to stand. Stand therefore
[1:02:14] having your loins gird about with the
[1:02:16] truth having on the breastplate of
[1:02:19] righteousness and your feet shaw with
[1:02:21] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[1:02:26] So through these scriptures tonight,
[1:02:28] we've come up in two direct uh uh
[1:02:31] scriptures talking about preparation, my
[1:02:34] brother and sister. So if our feet are
[1:02:37] already shaw with the preparation of the
[1:02:39] gospel of peace, then we can then walk
[1:02:43] with confidence. It's this preparation
[1:02:45] that's going to bring you and I to the
[1:02:48] place that we can come boldly to the
[1:02:50] throne of God. We don't have to come and
[1:02:52] ask permission to come because our feet
[1:02:55] are already prepared to walk on holy
[1:02:59] ground. Amen. So if we have a burning
[1:03:02] bush in our life, my brother and sister,
[1:03:04] God's prepared us to that. Amen. Coming
[1:03:07] into his presence and its holiness.
[1:03:10] Amen. He's already prepared us to come
[1:03:13] into his presence. So we should not be
[1:03:16] coming and saying oh I need to make
[1:03:17] preparation now to be able to come into
[1:03:20] his presence. We have the opportunity
[1:03:23] already and should be prepared. Amen.
[1:03:27] With our feet shaw with the preparation
[1:03:29] of the gospel of peace above all taking
[1:03:32] the shield of faith wherewith you shall
[1:03:34] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:03:37] the wicked. And boy I tell you his fiery
[1:03:40] darts can rain down on us. Amen. It
[1:03:44] takes more than just a human experience.
[1:03:47] It takes more than a superficial uh uh
[1:03:50] church experience or or religious
[1:03:53] experience to quench the fiery darts.
[1:03:56] Amen. And all the time we're seeing
[1:03:58] people are coming under influences.
[1:04:01] They're they're becoming disgruntled.
[1:04:03] They're uh offended. They're they're
[1:04:06] hurt by the things that's around. And
[1:04:08] yet they really, if they had been
[1:04:10] prepared, they would be prepared to
[1:04:13] quench those fiery darts. Amen. Take the
[1:04:17] helmet of salvation, the sword of the
[1:04:19] spirit, which is the word of God. And
[1:04:23] that
[1:04:24] sword in warfare means life or
[1:04:29] death. Without that
[1:04:31] sword, you cannot defend yourself.
[1:04:36] That's what Satan's trying to do. He's
[1:04:39] trying to turn this back into a benign
[1:04:44] book. People say, "But but but you know,
[1:04:47] Luther, my brother and sister, Luther
[1:04:50] only brought the people so far, and
[1:04:54] every age has brought the people a
[1:04:57] little further." And now we're at the
[1:04:59] age where as we look at the candlestick,
[1:05:02] it's turning back to darkness again
[1:05:05] because he's taking this and turning it
[1:05:07] once again into a benign
[1:05:12] book. Amen.
[1:05:19] praying always with all prayer and
[1:05:20] supplication in the spirit, watching
[1:05:22] there unto with all pers perseverance
[1:05:26] and supplication for all saints. You
[1:05:29] see, our preparation, my brother and
[1:05:32] sister, has come. God opened the word in
[1:05:34] our hour. He's brought us to a place
[1:05:36] that if we're willing to to sacrifice,
[1:05:40] enter into the word. Amen. Enter into
[1:05:43] the holiest of holies. Uh, and God's
[1:05:45] word is holy, my brother and sister.
[1:05:47] It's not something to be just tossed
[1:05:49] about, bantered about, to be turned into
[1:05:51] a comedy act or a a debate. And and uh
[1:05:55] what Satan can't defeat is the word. He
[1:05:59] cannot defeat the word. Not now, not
[1:06:02] ever. Amen. Never in the future. But if
[1:06:06] we ourselves will lay our preparation I
[1:06:10] is lukewarm then we will be laying down
[1:06:13] our sword which is represent to the
[1:06:15] word. Amen. We'll lay down our sword and
[1:06:18] then when the shout that the enemy is
[1:06:20] upon us comes we'll have no way to
[1:06:22] defend ourselves. Amen. But we stand.
[1:06:26] Let's make sure I just want this to be
[1:06:28] encouraging tonight. Let's make sure
[1:06:30] that we're digging into the word because
[1:06:33] that will be our own protection. That's
[1:06:36] what uh will keep us safe. Amen. In the
[1:06:39] day that we live in now Isaiah
[1:06:43] 54:17, I love this scripture because it
[1:06:46] is just very straightforward. No weapon
[1:06:49] that is formed against thee shall
[1:06:52] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:06:55] against thee in judgment thou shalt
[1:06:57] condemn. This is the heritage of the
[1:07:00] servants of the Lord, and their
[1:07:03] righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
[1:07:07] Let's be in preparation. Let's do what
[1:07:12] the word has asked us and apply the
[1:07:15] word. Apply it
[1:07:17] liberally. Don't let it just be a little
[1:07:19] here and there. And I'm speaking to
[1:07:21] myself. Sometimes we we get so busy in
[1:07:24] life that that we're really not giving
[1:07:27] the time that we should give. And let's
[1:07:29] let this be our season of preparation
[1:07:32] that we can come and be completely ready
[1:07:35] for the onslaught. My brother and
[1:07:38] sister, you know, the prophet of God uh
[1:07:41] all those years ago uh he says it a
[1:07:44] couple different times. He says,
[1:07:45] "There's nothing left but the coming of
[1:07:49] the Lord." And when you think about
[1:07:52] that, 1965, nothing
[1:07:55] left. My God's got grace. He's got
[1:07:59] mercy. And yet the word says he'll cut
[1:08:01] it short for you and
[1:08:04] I. Lord, help us,
[1:08:07] sister. Amen.
[1:08:10] I know I was going to say this is going
[1:08:11] to be a short service, but every time I
[1:08:13] do that, it
[1:08:16] malfunctions. So, I'm waiting till right
[1:08:18] now to tell you this is going to be a
[1:08:21] short
[1:08:24] service.
[1:08:27] Amen. You know, Brother
[1:08:30] David, come up here and grab a mic. I
[1:08:34] want to sing the song
[1:08:36] uh 776. Let your word be born. Amen.
[1:08:43] I know that.
[1:08:46] Do you know this song?
[1:08:48] Yeah. Go ahead and play. No, we're not
[1:08:51] going to make you
[1:08:53] unemployed. Um,
[1:08:55] does it matter which one of these mics?
[1:08:57] I don't know.
[1:09:04] There we go. Amen. Let's just stand.
[1:09:07] Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:12] Was a tiny simple stable all beaten and
[1:09:17] warm. Hardly a place for a king to be
[1:09:24] born. He didn't choose some place
[1:09:27] special to reveal his majesty.
[1:09:31] So I know if I give him control, he'll
[1:09:36] be born in
[1:09:39] me. Let your word be born in the manger
[1:09:45] of my
[1:09:46] heart. Let it live in me. Let it
[1:09:53] start. Live inside this house of clay
[1:09:57] and mold it every day.
[1:10:01] Let your word be born in the manger of
[1:10:07] my heart.
[1:10:14] Well, outwardly I'm nothing, not much to
[1:10:19] behold, unlikely a place for his word to
[1:10:25] unfold.
[1:10:27] I just yield this vessel and let him
[1:10:31] have his way from glory unto glory.
[1:10:36] He'll change me day by
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:40] day. Let your word be born in the manger
[1:10:46] of my
[1:10:47] heart. Let it live in me. Let it
[1:10:54] start. live inside this house of clay
[1:10:58] and mold it every
[1:11:01] day. Let your word be born in the
[1:11:06] manger of my
[1:11:10] heart. Let your word be born in the
[1:11:15] manger of my
[1:11:18] heart. Let it live in me. Let it
[1:11:24] start. Live inside this house of clay
[1:11:28] and mold it every
[1:11:31] day. Let your word be born in the
[1:11:36] manger of my
[1:11:41] heart. Well, outwardly I'm nothing. Not
[1:11:45] much to behold.
[1:11:49] unlikely the place for his word to
[1:11:54] unfold. But if he'll just yield this
[1:11:57] vessel and let him have his way from
[1:12:02] glory unto glory, he'll change me day by
[1:12:08] day. Let your word be born in the manger
[1:12:14] of my heart.
[1:12:17] Let it live in me. Let it
[1:12:22] start. Live inside this house of clay
[1:12:26] and mold it every
[1:12:29] day. Let your word be born in the
[1:12:34] manger of my heart.
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:42] Hallelujah. Let's just sing that little
[1:12:44] song. Higher ground 543.
[1:12:47] Amen. Thank you, brother David.
[1:12:48] Appreciate that. He has such a beautiful
[1:12:51] song. I first heard that, Brother David,
[1:12:55] many, many years
[1:12:57] ago. And
[1:13:01] um
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:09] Amen. pressing
[1:13:12] on the upward way.
[1:13:16] New heights I'm
[1:13:19] gaining every
[1:13:22] day. Praying
[1:13:25] as I'm
[1:13:28] onward. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:13:32] ground.
[1:13:34] Lord, lift me
[1:13:37] up and let me
[1:13:40] stand by faith on
[1:13:44] heaven's table
[1:13:47] land, a higher
[1:13:50] plane. Then I have
[1:13:53] found, Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:13:58] ground.
[1:14:00] My heart has
[1:14:02] no desire to
[1:14:05] stay where doubts
[1:14:09] arise and fears
[1:14:12] dismay. Though some may
[1:14:15] dwell where these
[1:14:18] abound, my prayer, my aim is higher
[1:14:23] ground.
[1:14:25] Lord, lift me
[1:14:27] up and let me
[1:14:31] stand by faith on
[1:14:34] heaven's stable
[1:14:37] land, a higher
[1:14:41] plane. Then I have
[1:14:44] found, Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:14:48] ground.
[1:14:51] I want to
[1:14:53] live above the
[1:14:56] world. Though Satan's
[1:14:59] thoughts and me are
[1:15:02] heard or faith has
[1:15:06] called the joyful
[1:15:09] sound a song of the saints on high your
[1:15:14] ground.
[1:15:16] Lord, lift me
[1:15:18] up and let me
[1:15:21] stand. My faith on
[1:15:25] heaven's table
[1:15:28] land, a higher
[1:15:31] plane than I have
[1:15:34] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:15:40] ground. I want to
[1:15:43] scale the utmost
[1:15:47] high and catch a
[1:15:50] gleam of glory
[1:15:53] bright. But still I'll
[1:15:56] pray till heaven I
[1:16:00] found. Lord lead me onto higher ground.
[1:16:06] Lord, lift me
[1:16:09] up and let me
[1:16:12] stand by faith on
[1:16:15] heaven's table
[1:16:18] land, a higher
[1:16:22] plane. Then I have
[1:16:25] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:16:31] ground. I want to
[1:16:34] scale the utmost
[1:16:37] high and catch a
[1:16:40] glee of glory
[1:16:44] bright. But still I'll
[1:16:47] pray till heaven I
[1:16:50] found. Lord lead me onto higher
[1:16:56] ground. Lord, lift me
[1:16:59] up and let me
[1:17:02] stand by faith on
[1:17:06] heaven's table
[1:17:09] land a higher
[1:17:12] plane. Then I have
[1:17:15] found Lord plant my feet on
[1:17:20] higher
[1:17:22] ground. Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord
[1:17:24] a little hand clap of praise. Lord, how
[1:17:27] we love you tonight. We thank you.
[1:17:30] Father, you're so gracious, so loving,
[1:17:32] so kind, so patient for us, Father.
[1:17:36] Lord, we just lift our hearts, our
[1:17:38] voices to say thank you. How we love
[1:17:41] you, Lord Jesus. How you've blessed us,
[1:17:44] Father. And we want to bless you with
[1:17:45] our praise, Lord. We just want to go out
[1:17:48] from this service tonight, Lord. Just be
[1:17:52] in the thought Lord the desire of
[1:17:55] preparation Lord the time is coming
[1:17:58] Father Lord the armies of the world are
[1:18:01] getting get ready for a great clash and
[1:18:05] Father Lord we know that Armageddon as
[1:18:07] it is is coming but that is not for your
[1:18:10] bride Lord we are here today to stand in
[1:18:13] your word and be prepared father as the
[1:18:16] prophet brought the little story Lord
[1:18:19] when the buck board drives up. Father,
[1:18:21] let us step from the porch right into
[1:18:23] that buck, be carried into your
[1:18:26] presence. Oh Lord, we thank you for the
[1:18:28] opportunity to serve you tonight, today,
[1:18:31] tomorrow, the days coming. Lord, help
[1:18:34] us. Give us a spirit of anticipation, of
[1:18:37] preparation, Lord, to be ready. Lord,
[1:18:41] not a foolish virgin still looking for
[1:18:43] oil, but Father, let our oil be filled
[1:18:46] and may we be ready. We ask this from
[1:18:49] the depths of our hearts in the name of
[1:18:52] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[1:18:56] Amen. God bless you saints. You are
[1:18:59] dismissed.
