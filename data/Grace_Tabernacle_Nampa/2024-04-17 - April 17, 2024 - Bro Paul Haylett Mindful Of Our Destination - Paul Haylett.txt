and sing that again open my eyes Lord I Want to See Jesus to reach out and touch him oh say all that we love you Lord Jesus open my ears and help me to L open my eyes Lord [Music] I want to see Jesus you know I always appreciated the portion where brother brandham says that if you don't see Jesus Christ in every scripture go back and read it again because he's present in his word he's present in all things and I believe this message strongly enough to say now we understand there's an influence of men God never took that away goes all the way back through the prophets of old they were men made mistakes Etc so we have balance there but I I want to say this in the right context every drop of this message points me Jus Christ and we don't have to go some people say just listen to the tape I'm not making a point there but just listen to the tape because there's no influence of man but when it's the Holy Ghost speaking you will only see Christ in what is preached amen there is a filter the Holy Spirit takes those things out because we're not called to the man we're called to Christ and I say thank you Lord appreciate that brother Alex sister Ruth all of our musicians appreciate it this evening um yes we definitely want to be uh in remembrance of our our brother Chris sister Kristen tonight uh I don't know you know seems like uh once you get far down the road you kind of forget about how it is to be young and having children and all these things and and I'm like okay and then I today just felt in prayer it's like you know what Paul conjure up the memory how you know it is and and uh it's a difficult time a nervous time but we believe God's on this scene and they're going to have uh this beautiful baby amen and and we'll get a claim it uh as part of our family and a boy or girl uh well anyway who votes for the boys uh anyway it was so funny uh visiting with them the other day and and and you know to see the different kids and Rosie one minute it's like a a girl and then literally she comes running back in the room a boy so whatever the Lord has in store so we want to remember them in prayer amen I want to speak to you for a few minutes and and I hope that I can bring this all together the Lord would bring it together just reading in 70 weeks of Daniel and uh come across these words that just kind of touched me and started my mind thinking uh uh oh it says on the screen they have a child oh my oh my 6:33 p.m. boy or girl we'll know in a minute amen wow wonderful 6:33 p.m. well thank you Lord It's all all is well all is healthy amen so anyway wonderful thank you Lord so as we look at these things that that we cover in the word sometimes you know the Lord uses certain things and as I was saying I'm reading in 70 weeks of Daniel and and these thoughts come and so let's turn to Hebrews 11 a very familiar scripture for us a very a mainstay I might say uh for Christians to put us in a position where we can really understand uh what faith is you know often times uh we we uh don't want to sound judgmental or narrow-minded but you know the message is so indelibly marked us that when when we would interact or conversation uh with others and they talk about different things Faith being one of those subjects you know we realize that that the the message has has the opening of the word has indelibly marked us to where we look at some of these things entirely different than the rest of the church world and and in that God has opened our eyes does it make us special no it makes us blessed that God would open our eyes it's not what we did it's what he shared with us and and we look look at these things in in Hebrews 11 understanding faith my brother and sister knowing that it is a gift of God and God has given it liberally Amen to his children his bride especially she has confidence uh you know in in the word of God and what God's doing in this hour how he's calling us and I want to talk to you um on the topic of mindful of our destination and um we would just come back into that and look in Hebrews 11:8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after reive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went and you realize this is a very type of when we get saved we're going out into a world we've never experienced before when we were living in the world living in sin we become quite familiar with the actions reactions of the world we lived in but when God started to call us and we'll elaborate a little more later but when God started to call us Saints do you realize how much faith it took for you to cast off everything you had Security in everything that you thought gave you peace everything you thought made you happy everything that you thought was necessary your security you cast it all off and said I'm going to trust the Lord and we'll stop and say I wished I had Faith you have faith the very first steps that you took as a Christian were anchored in faith we didn't recognize it is Faith but God doesn't have to point out everything you know like a legal document with all the little yellow arrows notice note sign every one of those poting out God said I don't have to do that you're already going to take a step you're going to trust me and you're going to have an expression of faith not find Faith you're going to have an expression of Faith because faith is a gift from God right amen we we can't we can't create faith we only set an atmosphere that faith is expressed in amen not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country did you catch that often times we read over this he's in the land of promise as though it was a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was p age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises H died in faith they're not going to get there and say well you didn't receive the promise so you're excluded no their faith that's it captured the promise amen so by faith the promise was actually fulfilled in them without the actual physical manifestation of the promise did that make sense God looked at it and says done amen I want him to look at us tonight done amen hallelujah but having seen them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embrac them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of the country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly can we say Amen to that tonight amen our country is not a better Nation amen the prophet said Abraham Lincoln uh and and George Washington on every country every corner won't change the direction of the country and it's becoming more and more and more evident in the world my brother and sister I don't care what great leader there is or what dominant leader there was in any Nation amen I I abbreviated this down tonight because it carries out but the word also declares that they would come to a time that their Harvest would not be fruitful we're looking at the promised word coming to pass the Harvest of this world of politics and Country and dominance all coming to not we pick on no country because it's not about country but countries that that put fear into people are are now showing that there's uh something not right something's not happening our great nation once dominant is mocked in the world today so the Harvest that man is looking for is coming to not but the bride of Christ is right in her midst amen I just get a little excited and get ahead of it she's been grafted in and the season of our grafting is close to finished and when that comes to fruition it's cut out and Israel the real Jew is grafted back in isn't God gracious and loving and kind to us amen we had no place but he grafted it this in amen Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for Your Love Your Grace your mercy for grafting Us in Lord help us father to be concise and Lord be able to express this what's uh in our heart Lord we ask you to be with each and every one that's not here tonight uh our sisters our brothers Lord whatever circumstance would be Lord just be with each one father make your presence known we love you and adore you and we appreciate what you do for us father ask us now we ask you father to just speak speak in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen so there it is if they'd been mindful in that country from when you may be seated from that country when they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned now I I just say this kind of straightforward tonight have you had opportunity to return to the country you came out of it's before us every single day an opportunity to just lay down the word sometimes Satan will just beat on us he'll he'll speak he's derogatory he's undermining all of these things and we have opportunity to return back there there's nothing to stop us from returning back but the Holy Ghost amen there's a there is the Paramount thing that keeps us amen cuz you see they couldn't return because they had a desire for a better country their desire that they had overruled any circumstance and disappointment that they might have had so this better country my brother and sister as we know there's no perfect country on the Earth today I do find it interesting uh whatever continent you would travel to and and I I think it's a good thing that people are are are fond or uh you know uh patriotic as it would be that that our country is the best you know I say this with a little bit of humor you go to Africa and they tell you that in heaven they're going to be speaking Africans you go to South America tell you they're going to speak Spanish and you get over in other countries you know and they'll tell you you know uh uh it's going to sound you know like those in Australia and you know it it's good to have a a little bit uh of that and you know there's a little humor we could share on that but we'll pass over tonight so it's good for us to be happy but you see every nation Kindred tongue and God did not start I had a brother one time I believe that was in South Africa told me he says brother Paul he says a Africa starts with a United States starts with you you've got to go through almost every language on Earth to get to you and so you know it's good I I like that but you see it doesn't matter because I'm not of this Earth you're not of this Earth We're Not of these nations we are Sons and Daughters of God called Before the Throne of almighty God in the mind of God he has placed us and you know um the Lord one thing I think is so wonderful my brother and sister wherever we might travel or not travel too much it doesn't matter but you see the Lord being so gracious is not just thinking of our journey sometimes we you know in the in the things of life we we get up and there's struggles and and you know there's difficulties and there's challenges however you want to word it find all the adjectives adverbs whatever you want to uh put in there that that we face but my brother and sister as we look at this you see God's not just looking at the struggle of today or yesterday or last month or last year God's not just looking at this journey that we're going through right now you know we should enjoy actually enjoy this journey you realize that being a Christian and having the Holy Ghost does not preclude you from enjoying this journey but you see it's not all just about the journey it's about the destination and so the Lord is here with us he desires uh I believe with all of my heart I believe that God desires for us to have a good journey he desires for us to have a journey where we can have joy and laughter and happiness and these things are there but it's also in this journey as the prophet of God if you don't mind me kind of amalgamating some things together it's in this journey that our character is molded if we do nothing my brother and sister our character will be nothing and so it's there in the labor it is the labor that makes the man it's not the man who makes the labor and so if we do not have any Challenge and we do not face you might say uh failure uh sometimes it's hard to just uh you know uh group these verbiage together and make it sound correct but you know sometimes we just simply have to have failure you know how you get better at something look at it from the natural here it would be very simple when when you fail and you have a desire you go back and you give more of yourself to it and that is a very close type to the spiritual tonight we don't even have to ask which of us have had struggles that we have failed at things in our life that that we uh do the scripture in some places kind of declares it as besetting sins uh some things it's there Paul said it was a thorn uh whatever you want to look at it tonight I I won't determine or interpret that for you but in there comes a time and a place that you have to make a decision do I quit now or do I press on and it's in the pressing on my brother and sister is how we fulfill the journey and this Christian walk that we live in you know I I remember as a young kid you would hear it you know people would say well when I got saved I thought all my challenge was over but I found out that it was actually greater but you see it's in the molding of that character that allows us to reach the the destination without that character we do not cross over we do not overcome now the Lord knew that we as Christians as young people or young in spiritual maturity had to come to a place of a certain level of maturity before God in essence would open the Hedge and let Satan Blas you and it without that maturity if we're just a very beginning Christian in in that Utopia time uh and we get blasted with some of the challenges you have faced this last year you you would be overwhelmed but God allowed you to build up he prepared you in the journey and now my brother and sister as our sister Sue has shared with me many many times I've gone too far to turn back now amen we can see we can see the city we can see the destination it's too close it's become too great in our eyes for us to stop and say I'm going to turn away if someone has journeyed for many years and turned away and says I just not going on I've decided this is not for me my brother and sister it wasn't the challenge of that day but it was a lack of preparation for the challenge which is prayer and reading our Bible Etc being in the word when we quit being prepared my brother and sister the enemy starts preparing amen but when we're prepared the enemy knows there's no way he can overcome and so he is not able he might challenge or try to stumble you but he knows he's not Victorious cannot be victorious so we see that it's really not an issue of you know somehow the the message failed us or the Bible or God failed us my brother and sister but it can be a challenge my brother and sister that we have failed oursel a perfect example many years ago and and I I just remember this as as kind of a a staggering thought the video is out there it was a uh kind of marathon or whatever uh a race and here is a man that is I I believe he was African but I believe you know Nigeria something like that and he had run to exhaustion and he's not here to the back door of the sanctuary from the finish line and he is completely physically given out but the thing that mattered most is in the physical failing him it had overpowered him mentally and he said I'm finished there was a little confusion because at the Finish Line there was a curve but the next Runner that comes was there coming strongly and when he rounds that corner and sees the man who has led him the whole race he doesn't see opportunity to say I'll beat him right here but to the uh shock of the whole crowd he stops puts his arm around this man walks him within a couple feet of the finish line and pushes him across and people said why did you do that you could have won this prestigious PRI prize here and he said would I have really won but you see this bride of Christ when she is rejuvenated by the word day by day when the Holy Spirit moving upon her giving her strength day by day my brother and sister it's not another man in the race that's pushing us across the line but it's the Holy Spirit coming right down saying just keep going you can do it your flesh has failed you but I will not fail you the man who was there that pushed him across the line they said why didn't you do that and he said because I knew what my mama would say he had so much respect for his mother and the upbringing that he had now let me turn this just a little bit how much respect do we have for the teaching and the mentoring and the encouraging of the holy spirit amen we should look at that and not look down on that that's what Satan's trying to bring us to a place that if we see a brother or sister struggling we pass them by and say I wonder what's wrong with them but may us may we have a a a respect for the Holy Spirit to come and say you know what that's my brother that's that's my sister Son of God daughter of God we will not pass you by we will not disrespect God in you but we're going to help you across the line maybe you will not say a single word to them maybe you will not touch them physically in any form or fashion but you will pray for them and you will uh uh beseech the Throne of God and say Lord that's my brother that's struggling that's my sister that's struggling this young person this teenager is struggling we don't automatically say oh I guess they just don't have what it takes no we stop and we do our best to get them across the line because that was the destination of everyone in that race and it's the destination of everyone in this race my brother and sister to hear the words well done my good and faithful servant to be able to stand and look upon the Lord and I know it won't be that way but just bear with me without some nagging little thing of the brother or sister that we kicked out of our way don't push grab take a hold of them Satan you can't have them they belong to the Lord and right now I'm God's hands and his feet and I'm his voice and I beseech the Throne of almighty God and I rebuke you Satan for trying to distract or Draw this one away and so the Lord is so gracious he's not just is thinking of our journey but he's mindful of our destination and you know sometimes we can say these words and I found in my own life that we can say well the Lord's in control we can say the words but sometimes down deep in our heart it doesn't feel like the Lord's in control it doesn't feel like anything's in control and Satan comes and says oh yeah oh yeah so everything's in control in your world right now and and you have to be honest and say no it doesn't seem like everything's in control but you see every aspect of our journey God if he would reveal to us the book wouldn't you really like to look in the book cuz in the book we would say well this just blindsided me this happened to this or this happened here H and uh you know I I just kind of was blindsided if God was to open up the book you would see they said you're going to come through a great time of trial great great struggle your fiery furnace is going to come upon you but if I could say it figuratively he'd Turn the Page and he'd say but you overcome that's right you see if we really saw the book God never showed the book to job job had to live the book amen we have to live the book Saints but let's have faith that the next page says that we overcome amen that we're more than Overcomers that's what the next page says don't don't try to get caught in the moment but look to the fact this part of the journey is rough but the destination's in sight amen wars and rumors of wars and we could go all through that the prophet of God talking about this my brother and sister it's just amazing how it's now open but so veiled now we see how that Israel's eyes were closed their ears were stopped so that they would stop their their progression you might say and their position and then we as grafted in we come and the life started to flow through you and I aren't you glad it's flowing through us tonight and and so it's there that Israel they couldn't see they can't hear they don't know what it is my brother and sister but look how when it comes to the right season that is switched back again and my brother and sister you look at this today our a country and I'm not preaching on the economy and presidents none of that really matters but we're looking now and look how it is that they start to talk things like well our our nation can handle 35 trillion billion whatever dollars of debt do you realize the collected taxes right now are not very far from not being able to pay the interest on our debt when the I I I just love their bookkeeping imagine you ran your house the way they run this nation we saved $40 billion but we're actually spending 140 billion more but it's 40 less 40 billion less than what we wanted to spend so they call that savings you imagine what our savings accounts would look like on that right there well we wanted a brand new Lexus and a brand new this and a brand new that and a brand new that and I I want an airplane and a boat and a train and a plane but I only bought a new car so I therefore save $300,000 take that one to the bank but it's all necessary see their ears have been stopped their understanding is stopped because they're fulfilling a prophet's voice that said and America will be bankrupt now at the time you could say that was fulfilled a long time ago but we're talking I believe this is Paul's opinion but we're talking about a true un sustainable unfixable bankruptcy where it's gone so far beyond there's not a hope that when the Antichrist comes and says this is the terms they have no choice but to accept them this is where we're going Saints but this is where we're going Hallelujah we got a destination they got a destination but God's looking at this journey because he's molding character in US amen can we lift a hand and say Lord mold my character tonight I want my character to match your word Lord I don't want to think I'm right or I'm okay or this is good enough I am striving I am going to step out and take a halt of your word because my life will be a reflection of your word amen no imitation but you see God already put in place the antidote now a rough definition of antidote is the remedy another rough definition of antidote is the solution you see God's already put in place the antidote my brother and sister we as Sons and Daughters of God are sitting here tonight we should not feel hopeless we should not feel like we got to give up amen the devil when you feel like giving up and the devil slaps me with with this one pretty regular when you feel like giving up recognize that's the devil that's standing there beating on you that's not who you are that's not your heart that's not your soul that's not your mind that's the devil saying quit amen because he knows but God's already given us the antidote the remedy to this and he said when you come in the time of trouble and we won't go into all the scripture reference you know your Bible but it comes in all the time of trouble amen what does the word say it says apply the word amen amen take the hsip and put it over the door my brother and sister you can uh uh create the barrier that keeps Satan from controlling your life amen so we apply the word and do you know that Christ is our hunger amen those of you know the message I don't even need to to go bear through that the prophet of God tells us that you never found God God found you amen so he is our hunger when we hunger for righteousness amen he's hungering through US amen amen when we thirst it's not our thirst it's his thirst thirsting through us amen hallelujah as it is the pipe cannot say this is my water all it can say is I have been called upon to deliver this water to hold this water transfer this water that's right and so here we are today he's our hunger he is our thirst and you know we have looking back here in Hebrews 11 my brother and sister we have a hunger or thirst the scripture says a desire a better country we have a hunger and a thirst for a better country amen not for a better house amen God bless those that live in a nice home and can drive a nice car and do all these things we're not talking about that level but we're looking at a place that there's something inside of us that says you know what Lord no matter how how good a house I live in how good a car I drive how much money got in the bank Lord there's something I'm thirsting for there's a life that I want more than this here that is drawing me and calling me amen so it's not a house that's been built with our hands he is our desire amen you know when we're out in the world there's a lot of things you desire we have to be careful we give our heart to the Lord that somewhere along the line we have to take the hatchet are we allowed to use violent terms we have to cut its head off right not hold the hatchet up and say let's have a peace treaty that was Israel's problem over and over and over again God told them go slay these people wipe them off and they went over there and turned them into slaves and took them home with them right and it wasn't long their sons were marrying them and their daughters were marrying them and then they said how how did Sin get in the camp see in their Journey they lost sight of their destination and it just become what we call life do any of you just live life sometimes you know I mean sometimes I get pretty pretty bluy as brother jeel would say wowy wowy wooy get up in the morning morning go to work come home tired eat go to bed get up in the morning go to work come home tired eat go to bed am I the only one in here that that kind of gets to you after a while thank you I have some allies I thought maybe I might be strange and we start to look at it and start to think Lord what what is this all about I read a deal that was written by a denominational Pastor back east as something on the order I I will have forgotten more of it than I remember something on the order he titled it the day of a thousand eyes it's almost like a poem I went out today and a few eyes saw me leave my home I went to town a few eyes saw me on the street I went to the market and walked the aisles and a few eyes saw me there and he goes on through every part I stopped at the gas station and some eyes saw me there I went home today some eyes saw me what did they see yeah it he doesn't say anything about talking to anyone but we know enough of the word to know they saw Christ walking in their midst amen because we are living Epistles amen amen so we're Desiring a house not built with hands and when we come to the place that he is our desire amen a desire is a strong feeling there's a lot of definitions you you can draw these from the abstract to the modern but he is our desire my brother and sister so he is our strong feeling it's not at time I I spoke about this at a at the uh uh a couples's banquet up in Canada but my brother and sister we got to get over the fact that we feel an obligation to serve God and we got to start focusing on it is a privilege to serve God Amen cuz when Satan gets us into the obligation portion then we suddenly are no joy no no excitement nothing really pushing us we feel obligated to do this and and so it comes to a time we got to get over the obligation and realize God's given us a privilege to serve him we have become privileged to live or Express the word of God now my brother and sister God knowing what we need can we say God knows what I need amen there's an known hunger remember when you weren't saved there was something inside there you tried to satisfy it here there yawn but nothing would satisfy this unknown hunger the reason I call it unknown hunger is because you could not really identify what was missing but you knew something was and so it's this unknown hunger in you but you see now I hope you follow me it actually was one of the first Revelations that ever was revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and that was the revelation of what that hunger really was when you realized it was a hunger for God Amen that's a pretty startling revelation we we just gloss right over that and go on but that would be one of the very first times in your life that God give Revelation to you when it was at an altar in a service in a living room in your own bedroom kneeling in the floor whatever it might have been that you realize I need God in my life that my brother and sister is a powerful Revelation but it shouldn't be a historic Revelation it should be a revelation that's alive today it should be a revelation that this morning we got out of bed and said I need God in my life I need more of you Lord but if we put it historic we'll say well I've been a Christian for 40 years what's that got to do with it that's right are you a Christian right now will you be a Christian in the next moment in the next day in the next week month year that's what matters my brother and sister not what we were 40 years ago but to understand how beautiful and I hope I'm explaining this well enough to understand that Revelation right there is a tremendously beautiful Revelation that God gave us it's not slavery it's not bondage it's liberty amen because we realize I can live so sorry to take such a drastic example I know a man he's still living but I haven't seen him for a bit smoked so much that his fingers were yellow from the nicotine well into his 60s I don't remember had a heart problem the doctor got through to him and said if you want to live to see your grandbabies grow up you've got to stop this and the man cold turkey quits smoking starts feeling better doctor reminding him every day that you don't every cigarette you don't smoke adds so many minutes to your life and next thing you know he's eating healthy I need to take his example he developed an appetite for vegetables but he used the words he said I caught a revelation of what nicotine meant to me hope you can follow this or I can clarify this I used to think nicotine was my life but I got a revelation one day that my wife my children my grandchildren is not a Christian unfortunately there life that was death that's it he come to that kind of Revelation without God but you see God in his infinite grace and mercy came to you and I and showed us that out there is not life that's death this is life thank you Lord for that kind of Revelation amen amen that we could come and not only that but he come and said I've not only ordained you to life but to get you to your destination you don't need to just quit this and quit that and come here and go there and whatever what you need is the pure unadulterated ated word to make it to your destination and God knew what it would take for us to make it to the destination and he started giving that to us hey if you're born in the message and you still get saved yes born in the message doesn't make you saved amen you are born in the message you get saved and God takes you on and fills you with the holy spirit opens his word to you you realize what kind of privilege God has given to you amen he Has Lifted you up to the pedestal of pedestals to say this is a son a daughter and I'm going to keep them pure all the days of their life I'm going to give them the word the Holy Spirit I'm going to take them in a Rapture I'm going to set him down at my throne and I'm going to call him my bride amen oh my brother and sister that is the Pinnacle of all things it's one thing to be the crudest of Sinners and be saved but I tell you you my brother and sister I believe higher than that is how the word can get a halts of a young life and take them and hold them and take them through leoa and bring them up in the end pure righteous and holy before God Amen Hallelujah and I don't know if God looks at it the way I do I can't hardly expect him to but I tell you my brother and sister let's flip the coin over I'm glad that when a person can tell God no over and over and over and over again and God will would still come back and say you're my son come now and you have to obey because the word is not speaking to this flesh it's speaking to this soul and he said that's my soul and I'm not going to lose a one oh thank you Lord amen oh look you know one of the critics of the message or you know one of the spirits of critics you know as they think we're out here with you know uh Jesus plus the message amen I'll tell you what my brother and sister it's only him amen not Jesus plus something amen not the message plus something not the word plus something it's Christ and Christ Alone there's where the word has come and it's in the power and authority of that word amen the sun stand still at the word amen demons flee at the word amen it's there that God is doing this work and every bit of it's recorded in the word amen hallelujah is it okay to be excited tonight the unfailing realities of the Living God the Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man but man wants to go to church I always I I found this very interesting right because we'll say' no I went to church to find God Prophet doesn't correlate that it drowns his thinking he cannot fathom it we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception God is known by the New Birth by the Holy Ghost not by any other way Jesus the Bible has plainly quoted us that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost the Bible's very judgmental yes sir we live in an age don't judge me don't judge me well I'm sorry if you refuse to be judged by the word there's no hope that's right some people say well I my God is a loving God to me this is love that's exactly right my little mind my soul says he loved me enough pull me out of the muck and the mire that's right washed me off not with a dainty little sponge and a feather but he set me up there and blasted it off and as I've often mentioned my little grandmother we would go stay with her she cleaned my elbows as a kid not with a washcloth but with a Brill pad cuz she said no grandson of mine is going to have dirty elbows they might be bleeding elbows but they're not going to be dirty elbows and she was sincere I can remember I'm it created a habit of my life that you know it's like yeah no they're clean okay yeah now my dear grandmother I love her and she she was very emphatic now if my grandmother could feel that way about her grandson how much more the Holy Spirit wants you and I clean now do you want him to use a little soft Rag and a feather or do you want the Brillo of the word and people say well that preacher is abrasive well maybe it wasn't the preacher at all maybe the Holy Spirit had the brill pad and the preacher there I don't know why I'm saying this I don't know why I'm doing this this is foolishness and then we all say Amen because that's what God said no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost and if you've never received the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is the Christ for that's the only way he reveals himself oh come on this is really straightforward my brother and sister and I don't want to try and add to it but it's here that people living any old kind of Life are saying the Lord told me you know the words that I can assure that any person in any condition the Lord told them repent and be baptized right anybody can say that and I'm going to believe them the Lord told me to repent and get baptized I believe you but when you have these circumstances where people say the Lord told me foolishness talking with a brother uh whole different part of the world the other day talking about a circumstance and he says now this comes like this and this person says that the Lord told them to divorce their wife and marry this what Bible is that out of come on you you know if you read your Bible you don't even have to do that one that's a devil speaking to someone not saying the person a devil the devil's speaking so you look at this my brother and sister and if you've never received the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is the Christ the anointed one amen is our life anointed I want to lift hand and say Lord I want my life to be anointed amen I want the word to anoint me your Holy Spirit to anoint me that I can stand with confidence and what I read in this Bible standing in the midst of my Promised Land are you with me I'm in the midst of my promised land and I'm standing there as a stranger but I know that while I'm in the midst of that that while I feel like out of place and out of cter that God put me there it was his word it's his Spirit his life his anointing and whatever I'm called for even if I feel out of place he's got me there for a reason oh can we say Amen to that tonight amen so we're never my brother and sister while we're in a Strange Land we're not in a strange promise that's right we're in his promise and he'll take us through the Strange Land to manifest that promise amen oh you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost some people would have a hard time they'd choke on that one remember as brother Adrian preached we'll have to stop tonight not here I hope by God's grace we'll have to pick up all the fragments because you see there's some of this word we call it the message but it's the Bible and they they want to nibble on the edges of it but they're not going to eat the crust because it's too crusty it's too hard on them can't can't deal with it now this is a little something I don't know Sister Jerry just did this but it strikes me as an example so sister Jerry made some sourdough bread the other day and I come in the house and I can smell this bread I'm thinking man this smells good and I go over to where this loaf of bread is that and there is a damp towel wrapped around this loaf huh I said 'jerry why is this on there so the crust won't get hard novel idea but I like hard crust you soak it in enough butter it's soft but there's two ways you can look at that we can water the message down so it's more palatable or maybe the Holy Ghost would come and wrap himself around you and I so that but we don't become old crusty Eagles amen hallelujah however you want to look at it but it struck me I thought oh praise God I'll eat the bread anyway and no I did not leave any crumbs or fragments amen I ate every drop of it and I pray that God would anoint you and I to eat every drop of it amen not leave anything to be collected to give to someone else amen so the Bible said so after Peter had been uh saved and sanctified give power to cast out unclean spirits and preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted that had to be painful that had to be painful my brother and sister and people get offended when the preacher would say now look you got to let go and let God work in your life oh no I've had the Holy Ghost for 25 years well maybe you're getting crusty and God's just being preemptive see it let's not look back and say I had a starting dat I mean we we always you want to get technical we always were Sons and Daughters of God that's right exactly but sometimes God's preemptive and he wants us to soak and bathe in the atmosphere because he knows what tomorrow's come the next page because you see I got sidetracked there the very page that describes the trial and I said you flip the page and then there's the words you're an overcomer let's go back two pages beyond the page that would tell you of the coming trial and we might feel like all is well but God doesn't shout a warning from the rooftops because he knows what's in you he knows you can handle this so very rarely I've had it happen in my life but very rarely um well I I I just share just smidge of that real quick we've been overseas before wake up in the middle of the night and the Lord show you things that are going to happen the next day it's just as plain as if you were living in the next day but have you noticed often times that the word does not come along and show you what Satan's going to try and do the next day because he wants us to put on our armor today and every day amen every day every day I'll buckle my armor on today because I'm going to have a great challenge no the Lord says put your armor on because every day is going to be a great challenge okay I've got to hurry so to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he's not converted until he received the Holy Ghost after you are converted then strengthen your brother amen if you're on an airplane if you're on a ship they will tell you get the life jacket on yourself before you try to put it on everybody else around you we need that sign hanging somewhere in the church amen if you feel like you're drowning get the life jacket on yourself first oh wait the scripture does deal with that get the mod out of your own eye amen so look at this how God's dealing we shouldn't be running around trying to put the life jacket on everyone until we ourselves and then by the time we get the life jacket on ourselves we find everybody around us has got their life jacket on Amen Hallelujah now look at this I gotta I got to hurry I'm sorry very much and that was on the night of the Betrayal that he was not yet converted no man is truly converted till he has been changed died to himself amen we use the hatchet on everybody else we should be using it on oursel the Holy Spirit Spirit has control of that person they don't want to do it get this now what's happening he's died to himself amen it's no longer what we want to do but it really has come down to what we don't want to do I don't want to be the old man that I was I don't want to express the spirit of leoda now if you get the balance of this wrong people will be like I go to Church faithful I don't need a holy ghost I don't know what they're talking about come on my brother and sister it's getting bad enough around the message even people are like our family's been in the message since brother Brandon was here what's that got to do with it got nothing to do with it God knows your destination he knows how to get you there he knows the trouble of your day and he has promised to take you to the destination even if the journey is hard but it's got to be your journey young people hear me well it's it's got to be your journey it can't be dad's Journey mom's Journey Aunt uncle grandma grandpa it's got to be your journey and it's got to be your vision of the destination that takes you on that Journey amen amen now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it'll make each person come into its character meaning the holy ghost's character see because it's a spirit that leads you it brings makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature are we okay amen and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it oh none of this I got to be a Christian I've got to live right no sir I have a privilege to serve God I have a privilege to say Amen to his word I have a privilege to be a living epistle amen sorry for getting so excited amen makes you live and love to do it oh how you love to give up the things of the world oh my when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you with the brillopad of the word amen it's that strong sometimes is it not and puts his desire into you to follow him and to thirst and a Hunger for More of it that's right just bathing yourself if the word was a great big pool the believer would be just like children they'd run jump in climb out run jump in climb out run jump in climb out amen because there's a thrill of getting back into the cleansing getting back into the presence getting Amen in into that completely amen reminds me of a kid we were little mix bathing back then but we were just little kids and I can remember there was there was this family that rented my grandmother's house and uh the canal was right there now in modern times giving an idea the canal to an adult would be about that deep and um this family lived there and uh they had a little girl we'd be visiting my grandmother and this little girl actually is about my age I guess and and she always have her hair all curled up her mama was big into all this stuff and she would get in the water and she'd never get her hair wet and I can remember another little boy that lived down the road there would come and and he one day looks at her and he goes my mama says if you don't get your hair wet you're not swimming I just remember that as a little memory and you know can we apply it Saints no we're not really getting into the water of the word unless we just get in amen now to finish kind of the funny side of that the canal was shallow enough right there that as boys we have to jump in and land on our bottom to get our head underwater and and you know but but there was a thrill about getting you know under the water I wonder sometimes we come to church we're okay the water of the word sosing around our ankles but never getting us completely washed now it don't matter the preacher might be poor I might not be communicating very good tonight but if you'll lay down in the presence of God it'll get every drop of you wet amen every drop of you will be washed amen it's not about how deep the preacher can preach it amen it's about whether or not you're willing to get down and get into the water of the word and let it have its effect upon you hallelujah amen it puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it just bathing yourself he brings realities now God place man here and in the days of the Lord Jesus he gave man a true road map to his power right here we are in Journey a road map a road map is something that tells you tells you which way you're headed and if you want to go when we leave in the next few days I've crossed this country so much my wife and I were amazed to think of it for the last few years you could mention where you want to go and I can tell you any road that leads to it and within 15 minutes of the time you would arrive from here to California and I haven't missed it a time in I don't know sometimes right on the dot see calculating my time of what the driving time is and the average of time and I've just been back and forth up and down back and forth until you just know it and that's the way God wants us to know his word amen we've been in it it's not foreign to us we know what it means he knows where it's taking us we know the effect it's having on us my brother and sister but if we haven't traveled y we haven't traveled if we don't know just a side note brother Sergey and I have joked about this before somebody says how long does it take to get to the Tri Cities first question is how fast you're driving second question is are you in a car or a truck all these little factors my brother and sister we're going to get to our destination I don't know you see God has not revealed to us in this present condition how long it's going to take us to get to our destination it might be five more years 10 more years I don't know right but you see if you're not on the right route you're not heading the right direction that's correct and you're not moving at all right it won't make any difference right but if a Christian will get out and walk this old gospel Highway amen men and just start walking not worry about that maybe someone remember that little old lady brother brandom saw be on the curtain of time got saved in her 90s somebody which was a prophet yeah somebody had to carry the word to her she walked all those years well to her 90s to get saved where are we going to stop where are we going to start that's the way God wants us to know his word we know it we've traveled it we've tested it we tried it you know where it leads to how his road map is his Bible now his road map is his Bible the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God faith leads you to the power power produces the promise we need power amen amen hallelujah we got about two more minutes amen Satan's not without a game plan you know that the devil has a game plan in fact the prophet of God said the devil knows you better than you know yourself that's scary when you think about that in more of a natural context that's scary that the devil could predict as it were what you would react to this situation to this situation the only way we can break Satan's understanding is to be in the word amen because it Shields see brother brandham I read this a while back and I'm going to say this is deductive reasoning so forgive me if you recognize it but amen you see Satan looking at us expecting us to act a certain way the holy spirit in US is moving us calling us to a different walk average I don't know 25 year old in the world today without God in their life Satan can pinpoint their actions reactions thoughts Deeds take a 25y old filled with the Holy Ghost he might fail once in a while come on I'm just going to be blunt tonight amen the prophet of God said I just heard him say it it's interesting to hear the prophet talking about that oh how beautiful that little girl was we all are like but the prophet's making a point and we might fail Brothers we might look that second time and Satan had go ha there it is just like I thought but then the Holy Spirit comes down and that brother's like forgive me Lord Satan's like this is not in the plan I can't see that now it's covered in blood and that's what God's doing because he knows the destinations right here and he's not going to allow ow us to fail right here did you hear me I mean it how I said it he's not going to allow us to fail amen amen the devil says but you looked but the blood's covered that Satan amen amen now Satan's got his plan Isaiah 17:10 there's more to it in Isaiah there 177 in the chapters but it's there see part of this plan of Satan is it says here in the verse because thou Hast got forgotten the god of thy salvation and Hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant Pleasant plants he'll preach that everybody's going to heaven everybody saved Pleasant plants and Shall Set it with strange slips now we're not going to carry any farther in that thought but you see this all comes when Satan's plan gets us thinking about life and we start to forget the things of God and we start to do good and we forget that the only strength we have is him we got nothing else Beyond him but if he can get us to the place we think somehow we did this reminds me of a little situation you know some time back you know you you do something and and it turns out well and then the same thing on a different thing breaks and you think I fixed it before I can do this and you make a terrible mess and you realize you know what I didn't really have the ability or the skill it's only when I thought I did that I realized how weak and what a failure see our strength comes it's in Jesus our Solid Rock Amen period that's what we got to remember don't leave the house without him amen that's all that comes down to us but see Satan wants us and I I I say this as I'm closing uh Satan he doesn't come and say forget about Jesus Christ as your savior forget about Jesus as in a Manger you don't have to forget about that just get distracted long enough that this awareness that this is a holy sacred Tabernacle just forget about that little things start to slip right not big things oh yeah Jesus our savior yeah lie cheat steal you get my point making no connection to Jesus our savior I just experienced that and just recently of someone whose life is um not judgmental on them but their life is very out of kelter very chaotic very disjointed and look you in the face and say oh Jesus Is My Savior we forgot what it is to be saved forgot what it was to be be cleansed forgot what it was to be delivered forgot what it was to be empowered by the word of God and if Satan can get you to forget those things he doesn't have to deceive you you could believe God sent a prophet you could believe all of these other things but it's powerless I'm not being too hard am I so I I need to hurry here um so take a home do it as homework if you would Jeremiah 29 10-13 you know this for thus sayith the Lord uh you know I'm going to return I know the thoughts I think toward you you know the scripture amen so in the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel um we'll look at this my brother and sister and and [Music] uh yeah there we go brother Gideon thank you I hope you like this to me I I just actually loved this when I read it you can go back I shortened it down because of time wouldn't that make you good to think that God loved you if I wasn't greatly loved I'd just like to know that kind of loved a little bit up there wouldn't you yeah sure just kind of he thinks of me once in a while it would just make me just want to scream to think that he even cares for me and we have the assurance that he does care for us because while we were yet sinners Christ died in our stead brother and now which we were alien from God and now has made us nigh unto God and has given us the earnest of our Salvation that is the Holy Spirit and with uh faith in there that lifts us up above the things of the world and we ride over the top of it amen look at this my brother and sister leoda is not getting better God's lifting you above leoda and taking you taking our children our grandchildren amen our marriages our our friendships and our relationship with the Lord he's lifting us up we're no longer waiting in the swamp right he's carried us above that amen that's glorious isn't it all right while in prayer Gabriel come and told him that there was not only was not only two more years before they were going back to the Homeland but told him the entire destination of that Nation we had a message that came my brother and sister not just encouraging us to live like a Christian but gave to a bride of Christ the entire revelation of our destination oh hallelujah we're not just going to church to be able to say I've attended this church for 70 years our families believe the message for four generations now no my brother and sister the destination is a revelation amen amen the heavens my brother and sister the Heaven that the world denomination talking about is not the same Heaven that God revealed to you and that might might be a little bit to stumble over but I'm telling you their Heaven has a really broad gate yeah that's right but God called you to walk a narrow way and overcome and have joy in that amen oh sorry entire destination think of it the entire destination every journey of Earth Gabriel explained it to to Daniel said he was sent to tell Daniel this great thing how that Prophet must have felt and he told him that there were 70 weeks determined upon the people until the consummation that's the end time so it's all over the consummation he says there is 70 weeks and this goes on and we're familiar with the 70 weeks of Daniel but my brother and sister the clock has been ticking sister Ruth would you come play loudly that will get me to stop amen just want to remind you everything we need for this journey to make it to our destination already been given to us when you feel weak you feel discouraged you feel whatever you would feel just remember he's walking right there with you and he's already given us the antidote Satan's poisonous arrows have no effect on the bride of Christ Hallelujah they affect our flesh amen they affect our thinking but they don't affect the bride because the bride is not this body the bride is that word seed that we carry in our souls Hallelujah that's the real bride cuz imagine my brother and sister God's not a [Music] polygamist y it's got one bride but many members of the same exact genetic DNA makeup Hallelujah so you know what it is I like this I hope you guys don't mind a little humor as we close the service I really like that because you see that same exact DNA from Christ in me that's in other Brothers Well I realize in God's eyes I'm just as good-looking as those other brothers hallelujah it's not me the flesh man that he's looking at he's looking at his word and his word is beautiful so whenever you get discouraged just remember in God's eyes you're beautiful Hallelujah let's stand can we sing a song or two amen 478 thank God I am free amen that's a a g in for a long time I travel down a long lonely roll my heart was so heavy s i sank low then I heard about Jesus Oh What A Wonderful hour oh I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out through his saving power thank God I am free free all free from this world of sin then washed in the blood of Jesus I've been borned again Hallelujah I'm save save save by his Wonderful Grace oh we can say Amen to that I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out show me the [Music] way like a bird out of prison that's taken its fly that God gave back his sign oh like the poor wretched beggar found fortune and fame well I'm so glad that I found out he would bring me out through His holy name oh thank God I am free free oh free of sin I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born [Applause] again Hallelujah I'm save save save by his Wonderful Grace well I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out show me the way hallelujah amen 10:19 brother amen we just ask our brother Alex just to come and lead us in this little course if he has something else on his heart but um thank you for your patience tonight I knew I should have erased some of those between the notes notes cuz they're there and you just can't help if you can see them you can't help but preach them it's like I'll save that for later amen you know it's kind of like putting a piece of pumpkin pie on the counter and saying I I'll let leave it for later and you walk by it 12 times pretty soon the pumpkin pie has disappeared and the words are there oh unction got to say it here I am going doing that yes amen if death if death can sting us and the grave can't hold us if he's already brought us back from where sin sold us we forgot we were free but he came and told us if death has lost and the grave can't win and I'm not a slave of sin am I not already in my victory if death can sting us and the grave can't hold us if he's already brought us back from where sin sold us we forgot we were free but he came and told us if death has lost then the grave can't win and I'm not a slave of sin am I not already in my victory one more time if death can't sting us and the grave can't hold us if he's already bought us back from where sin sold us we forgot we were free but he came and told us if death has lost in the grave can't win and I'm not a slave of sin am I not already in my victory amen amen enjoy that tonight can we uh sing number 355 just that little course I keep falling in love with him as we get ready to dismiss I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by oh what a love between my Lord and I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over over again he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by oh what a love between my Lord and I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again amen with that song you're dismissed God bless you [Music] h [Music] [Music]
