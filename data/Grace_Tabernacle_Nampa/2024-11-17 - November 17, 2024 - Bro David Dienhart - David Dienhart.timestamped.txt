[37:18] now here because where two or three are
[37:20] gathered together in my name there he
[37:22] said I will be in their midst so if
[37:25] you're gathered here in his name not
[37:27] just just a statement but a
[37:30] relationship in his name I will be in
[37:33] their midst see he's here so what manner
[37:37] of people ought we to be when the word
[37:38] is coming forth not the word of a man if
[37:41] I want to bring the word of a man I have
[37:43] no it would do nothing for
[37:45] you God uses man but it's not the man's
[37:48] intelligence it's God's word it's God's
[37:51] will it's God using a gift that doesn't
[37:53] make the man any different than any
[37:55] other man it doesn't even save a man
[37:58] gifts and callings are without
[37:59] repentance he were born with them amen
[38:02] we've got to know him we've got to know
[38:04] him not just know about him we've got to
[38:07] know him as life amen that's why we're
[38:10] here this morning we've gathered here to
[38:12] meet him not to meet me to meet him I'm
[38:16] expecting him to use this vessel and
[38:18] speak through this
[38:20] vessel are you willing to receive his
[38:22] word that's the next thing see God will
[38:25] work when you pull on the gift you on
[38:27] the word God will
[38:29] speak amen that's right it's what he
[38:31] said so God bless you our brother just
[38:34] visitor God be with you happy to have
[38:36] you and uh I'm just going to say
[38:39] something here this morning this may be
[38:40] a little
[38:42] rich but I'm carrying on with a little
[38:45] series that I've had this will be the
[38:46] end of it and I'm expecting God to cap
[38:48] it
[38:49] off amen I believe we have a Capstone
[38:53] messag we have a message that God sent
[38:55] to us as he said he would always would I
[38:57] will do nothing but I reveal my secrets
[39:00] to my servants the
[39:01] prophets they would hold the
[39:03] interpretation of the word for their
[39:05] season you had no right to question that
[39:08] Prophet because God was stepped into him
[39:10] and speaking his word it's not the man
[39:12] it's God that's right
[39:14] amen the sword put in put was put in his
[39:18] hand but God held the
[39:20] sword amen it's not it's not a king
[39:24] sword it was the king
[39:26] sword amen William brandom is not the
[39:28] king that's right William brandom was a
[39:31] king just as you and I are Kings he made
[39:33] us Kings and Priests that's right that's
[39:37] right see we're not he's got the sword
[39:41] and he's here to cut away everything in
[39:43] your life against you and against your
[39:45] relationship with God if you'll let him
[39:47] do it he will for the bride amen we God
[39:51] has a bride do you know God has a bride
[39:53] the bir said he has a bride amen so a
[39:56] bride
[39:58] knows her Lord and the uniting time is
[40:02] on we know that the marriage the
[40:05] marriage is come we're going to a
[40:07] Rapture we're going to a wedding supper
[40:10] there's a union taking place that the
[40:12] world knows nothing
[40:14] about but it's according to his promise
[40:17] that he said it would take place and and
[40:19] he'll fulfill every promise so we see
[40:21] him fulfilling his word amen if you'll
[40:24] stand with me let's have a word of
[40:26] prayer what what I'm going to say you
[40:28] might disagree with you may disagree but
[40:31] if you'll just go back to the word and
[40:32] search it out and if I'm wrong I don't
[40:36] know it if you're wrong maybe you don't
[40:38] know it so Lord may you help us all amen
[40:42] amen you may question that's fine but we
[40:46] know the scripture is dual
[40:48] Revelation
[40:49] and we see a happening in this hour we
[40:53] say faith taking hold in the bride
[40:55] because what she has in her is God's
[40:58] faith and it's moving in her and that's
[41:00] who she is Faith is not a hope so faith
[41:03] is not an imagination faith is a no so
[41:06] the Bible said faith is the substance of
[41:08] things hoped for it's a substance it's
[41:11] not something you imagine or you think
[41:12] you have it's something you know you
[41:14] have and it's a substance of things that
[41:16] the promise of the word gives you and
[41:19] it's the evidence of Things Not
[41:21] Seen and there's the Believers they
[41:23] believe that they walked with it amen
[41:26] they held to it amen God God requires

[48:01] word not organization not denomination
[48:04] not Council of
[48:06] churches amen all right and out of his
[48:09] mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it
[48:11] he should Smite the Nations and he shall

[48:17] fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and
[48:20] he hath on his vesture and on his thigh
[48:22] a name
[48:24] written King of Kings and Lord of lords
[48:28] amen amen you may be
[48:29] seated I would like you to go with me to
[48:32] Isaiah chapter
[48:34] 61 I'm going to read a few more
[48:36] scriptures to lay down here the
[48:38] foundation of what it will speak this
[48:40] morning Isaiah chapter I didn't have
[48:43] time to Mark these off so I've just got
[48:44] to look for them as well as you look
[48:46] them up so we'll just do
[48:54] that and it's right near the end there
[48:56] Isaiah and brother brandham preaching a
[48:59] message and you may hear me say brother
[49:01] brandham I'm referring to a prophet sent
[49:03] in this hour with the spirit of
[49:06] Elijah if you don't want to believe that
[49:08] but it's the promise of the word before
[49:10] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[49:12] the the Lord would send that Spirit of
[49:14] Elijah back on a man just like he did
[49:16] Elijah Elisha John the Baptist and now a
[49:20] messenger for our day and one yet to
[49:23] Israel amen all right but we've had a
[49:26] message and the message is what makes
[49:28] separates us and divides and separates
[49:31] that wheat that seed from the
[49:34] shuck all right because the shuck is
[49:37] bundled together the bride is
[49:41] separated amen all right now they're
[49:43] bundling together right under a council
[49:45] of churches they're bundling together in
[49:48] the world Council they're all coming
[49:50] together saying for Fellowship but God
[49:52] never did ordain Fellowship that way the
[49:54] fellowship with him was with his word
[49:58] how can two walk together except they be
[50:01] agreed and what do they agree upon
[50:04] there's no Foundation they're agreeing
[50:05] upon there's no gospel they're agreeing
[50:07] upon they're agreeing upon man's
[50:09] denominational teaching which Satan gave
[50:12] to Eve right in the very
[50:14] beginning and that church the woman is a
[50:17] dominating female that's contrary to the
[50:19] word of God Amen and they're coming
[50:22] under that headship of
[50:24] Rome not communism you don't have to
[50:26] fear communism communism is going to
[50:29] stand up for the bride and destroy that
[50:31] Vatican going to destroy that
[50:34] Beast amen just like ju in the Bible
[50:37] rose up against
[50:40] Jezebel amen who amen who destroyed
[50:46] Jezebel who was ordained to destroy
[50:48] Jezebel who's that Jezebel today that
[50:51] religious Beast that religious false
[50:54] prophet out here
[50:56] right and it's going to take the head of
[50:58] the whole thing though the people never
[51:00] did Envision it that b watch it come to
[51:02] pass it's coming under politic politics
[51:05] and religion and Satan's move right
[51:08] there it's exactly where it's coming I
[51:11] may never heard it that way but you're
[51:12] hearing it now because that's that's the
[51:16] truth she had daughters that prostitute
[51:19] that she the church in Revelation 17 had
[51:22] daughters she was a she's a and
[51:25] she had daughters which were PR
[51:26] prostitutes that's right yes and she had
[51:30] daughters who are those daughters she

[51:34] daughters every denomination every every
[51:37] I don't care if it's Methodist Baptist
[51:39] those are Blasphemous names amen I'm not
[51:42] talking about the people I'm talking
[51:43] about the system the system is a
[51:45] dominating system and it tries to warm
[51:48] its way even into the very around the
[51:50] message today it's that same
[51:53] spirit amen that's right all right I
[51:56] don't know why it's said all that but
[51:57] I'm I'm saying it just the same go back
[51:59] to Isaiah
[52:00] 61 brother Brown preached a message
[52:03] called this day the scripture is
[52:05] fulfilled and we're taking this
[52:08] here in the second
[52:11] verse because he stood up to read the
[52:14] scriptures in Nazareth and he took the
[52:17] book from the hand of the priest the
[52:18] priest handed it to him and he turned to
[52:20] this
[52:22] scripture and he read these scriptures
[52:24] proclaimed the acceptable year of the
[52:26] Lord
[52:28] and he stopped I'm just quoting a part
[52:31] of that but he stopped handed the book
[52:32] back and sat down and precious words
[52:34] come out of his lips amen that anointing
[52:38] was that power in
[52:40] control amen he was breaking forth the
[52:43] word for That season and he said this
[52:45] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[52:48] ears we have a Prophet come back now in
[52:50] the second coming of Christ that was the
[52:52] first coming in the second coming of
[52:55] Christ the word which is the anointed
[52:57] word he comes back with the this now and
[52:59] the second half is the day of Vengeance
[53:01] of our God to comfort all that
[53:04] mourn I want you to notice first coming
[53:07] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[53:09] Lord the second coming is to proclaim
[53:10] the Vengeance of our God to comfort all
[53:13] that mourn what's he doing the messenger
[53:16] comes with a trumpet and the trumpet
[53:18] sounds the trumpet and it calls for war
[53:20] it declares war a spiritual
[53:24] war amen are you with me is that right
[53:27] all right
[53:29] so so we we're just laying this out now
[53:33] I want you to go to Second
[53:36] Thessalonians 2
[53:41] Thessalonians as I said you may not see
[53:44] this you may not believe it that's all
[53:45] right that's I I got to preach what's on
[53:48] my
[53:51] heart all right second
[53:54] Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 7 and you
[53:59] who are troubled rest anybody troubled
[54:02] these are troubling times aren't they
[54:03] troubling politics troubling times
[54:06] trouble all over it's a Babylon it's
[54:08] confusion nobody knows where to stand
[54:10] and what to think and how to even think
[54:12] fear is coming upon man amen is that
[54:15] right of the things that are coming to
[54:17] pass upset weather everything what is it
[54:20] it's judgments of God coming into
[54:22] manifestation more and more amen we're
[54:25] moving into that why because this nation
[54:27] has rejected the
[54:29] word because we had a prophet with the
[54:31] word and they turned him down the
[54:32] denominational system turned him down
[54:34] put him out and we find in in in
[54:37] Revelations 3 that he was on the outside
[54:39] of the church they put him out they put
[54:41] the word out wouldn't have it rule over
[54:43] him amen is that
[54:47] right but he was knocking on the door of
[54:50] the church saying anyone any individual
[54:52] that will open this door the knob was on
[54:54] the inside will open the door I will
[54:56] come in and Su with him and he with me
[54:58] and to him that overcometh now we're
[55:00] talking about overcoming we're talking
[55:01] about the Overcomer this morning and
[55:04] we're talking about the word of
[55:05] overcoming yes amen that word is riding
[55:09] that word is going forth that overcoming
[55:13] and to him that overcometh will I grant
[55:14] to sit with me in my Throne as I have
[55:17] overcome the same way how did he
[55:19] overcome and how did you overcome by the
[55:21] word and so and to him that overcometh
[55:24] I'll Grant to sit with me in my Throne
[55:25] as I also have overcome and set with my
[55:28] father in his throne but then we see a
[55:31] corner turning and then Revelations
[55:33] which we haven't got to we'll come to in
[55:34] a minute Revelations
[55:36] 4:1 amen we went into a bride time
[55:40] there's a bride
[55:41] age okay now so we see now he said in
[55:44] verse 7 and to you who are troubled rest
[55:47] with us when the Lord Jesus shall be
[55:49] revealed
[55:50] from heaven with his mighty
[55:54] angels with his might Angels how many
[55:57] know what we're talking about here with
[55:59] this seven of them seven angels that's
[56:02] already happened brother sister that's
[56:03] already come to path acts 1 19-11 is
[56:07] already taken place and we're and he's
[56:10] unveiling himself in an invisible Union
[56:12] with his bride for the marriage is
[56:15] come now this sounds very strange I know
[56:18] some of you think I've never heard this
[56:20] before no you haven't because they've
[56:23] turned down the system of denomination
[56:25] has turned down that opened revealed
[56:27] word from Heaven they wouldn't take it
[56:30] they wouldn't accept it God turned right
[56:32] away from them amen and open those Seven
[56:35] Seals to an undenominational word born
[56:38] bride yes amen yes amen and there's a
[56:41] union taking place and he's come down to
[56:43] make that Union and and the word is
[56:46] becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming
[56:48] the word by that
[56:50] Union amen all right and so we see here
[56:54] rest with us when the Lord shall be who
[56:56] shall be
[56:57] revealed now if you take that we can go
[57:00] if we had time again we've taken it in
[57:02] the past two three services first
[57:04] Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself
[57:07] shall descend from heaven with a shout a
[57:10] message a message to who directed to who
[57:13] yes the elect the for ordained of God
[57:17] God has an elect bride God has
[57:19] predestinated because he knew what they
[57:21] would do he said I've chosen You by forn
[57:24] knowledge I've chosen you and ordained
[57:27] you that you should bring forth fruit
[57:29] and and cuz I knew what you would do
[57:31] you'd choose me
[57:33] amen and we had a choice but God put us
[57:36] on free moral agency knowing he would
[57:39] knowing but he had to put it on free
[57:40] moral agency and we had to make a choice
[57:43] but our choice is made because we are
[57:46] ordained to make that
[57:48] choice take the choice with the word
[57:51] there's always been that elect few there
[57:53] wasn't very many in the time of John the
[57:55] Baptist just a few there wasn't the time
[57:57] of Jesus just a few 70 left him he said
[58:00] turned to the 12 and said would you go
[58:02] also he said where would we go Peter
[58:04] said you have the words of eternal life
[58:07] and so we where would we go where are we
[58:08] going to go we know that God has
[58:10] Vindicated his word of eternal life and
[58:13] has spoken it and we're receptive of it
[58:15] and we hear it and it's being manifested
[58:17] and that manifestation as it said is
[58:19] catching away a
[58:21] bride all right so and my my title today
[58:25] is the catching of way of Christ the
[58:27] bride that's my title catching way of
[58:29] Christ the bride and I want to put under
[58:32] that the summons to come away move is on
[58:35] for the bride the summons has come forth
[58:37] the summons the call has been made Come
[58:40] Away bride move a move is on for the
[58:43] bride he said that's thus sayeth the
[58:45] Lord the move is on for the bride how
[58:47] many believe he said we're in the
[58:48] raptured
[58:50] time well the raptured time wasn't the
[58:52] Leo to see and age we've come beyond
[58:54] that we've come out of dark
[58:56] denominationalism you didn't find
[58:57] Rapture time there you found the Rapture
[59:00] time in the unveiled
[59:02] word that's Rapture time that's what day
[59:06] we're in amen so we're in the Rapture
[59:09] time and he said the it's got to come to
[59:11] that full manifestation of the Rapture
[59:14] so does revelation have to come to the
[59:15] full
[59:18] manifestation
[59:19] amen all right and but we're in that
[59:22] manifestation we're we're following
[59:26] all right now following who so rest with
[59:29] us when when Lord be revealed from
[59:31] heaven with his mighty Angels how in
[59:34] flaming
[59:35] fire taking
[59:38] Vengeance what's the second half of of
[59:41] Isaiah 61 Vengeance proclaiming
[59:45] Vengeance taking Vengeance on them who
[59:48] know not God and Obey not the gospel of
[59:52] our Lord Jesus Christ they turn it down
[59:54] they rejected it all right now who shall
[59:58] be punished with Everlasting destruction
[1:00:00] from the presence of the Lord what has
[1:00:01] to go forth to do that the
[1:00:04] sword what's he going to slay his Enemy
[1:00:06] by the
[1:00:07] sword how is Satan Bound by a chain of
[1:00:11] Revelation a chain of
[1:00:15] circumstances amen that's exactly what
[1:00:17] it is and and and that chain of that
[1:00:20] Revelation
[1:00:22] spoken binds that devil
[1:00:26] and cast him away what's the key I'm
[1:00:28] talking about Revelations 20 now we may
[1:00:30] get to it we may not but Revelation 20
[1:00:32] there was an angel that had the key to
[1:00:34] the bottomless pit
[1:00:36] right and that key was a was a key of
[1:00:39] Revelation and those circumstances which
[1:00:42] were happening facts happening
[1:00:45] circumstances here I I've got it right
[1:00:47] here I didn't plan to read this until
[1:00:48] now but a a circumstance is the fact or
[1:00:51] condition connected with or revent to an
[1:00:54] event or action
[1:00:57] and our event is that heaven is
[1:00:59] opened all right and and and set it's a
[1:01:03] set of
[1:01:05] conditions is a circumstance it's a set
[1:01:08] of
[1:01:10] conditions okay all right now we'll come
[1:01:13] into that maybe a little bit later here
[1:01:15] all right so in flaming fire taking
[1:01:17] Vengeance on them that know not God obey
[1:01:19] not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
[1:01:21] Christ and shall be punished with
[1:01:24] Everlasting duck destruction from the
[1:01:26] presence of the Lord and from the glory
[1:01:29] of his
[1:01:31] power when he shall come when he shall

[1:04:06] she his love who is she
[1:04:09] himself God is
[1:04:12] love it's different than a filal love
[1:04:15] friendship love it's a higher love than
[1:04:19] that Amen brother Brown described it as
[1:04:22] well the scripture described as Jesus
[1:04:23] walking through the multitude went to
[1:04:25] one man
[1:04:26] but they're laid Halt and M and and
[1:04:28] children and everything everything in
[1:04:30] the and and a god of compassion and
[1:04:35] love but he said we don't know what
[1:04:37] compassion is we don't know what love is
[1:04:40] because love fio is not fio of most
[1:04:44] people have a fio only the bride has AG
[1:04:49] gape amen only the bride has agape
[1:04:53] love that's God's Own love
[1:04:56] that's a higher love than a friendship
[1:04:58] love that's a higher love than between
[1:05:00] you and your wife that's a higher love
[1:05:02] than that that's a love what is the word
[1:05:05] revealed for the season that you're able
[1:05:07] to receive in
[1:05:09] you and that's the true love for the
[1:05:12] Brethren that's the true love for the
[1:05:14] word amen and he said that compassion
[1:05:18] they thought he was a god of compassion
[1:05:20] but he said we don't know what God
[1:05:21] compassion is compassion he said is
[1:05:24] doing the will of God agape love is
[1:05:26] doing the will of
[1:05:30] God he said he was a god of love amen
[1:05:33] that's right but he passed them all by
[1:05:35] and went to
[1:05:39] one but here he is speaking rise up and
[1:05:42] I don't mean to get sidetracked here but
[1:05:44] rise up my love my fair one how fair is
[1:05:48] she just as Fair as he
[1:05:51] is he's the fairest of
[1:05:54] 10,000 the little of the valley is that
[1:05:56] right how fair is the
[1:06:01] bride she's pretty
[1:06:03] fair not in man's God Man's eyes but in
[1:06:07] God's
[1:06:10] eyes she came from him a part of him she
[1:06:13] came from him I he she was chosen in him
[1:06:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:17] Ephesians 1:4 she the bride was chosen
[1:06:20] in God before the foundation of the
[1:06:22] world to be without blame before him in
[1:06:24] what love come away my bride come away
[1:06:28] my love my fair one and come
[1:06:32] away all right verse 13 the Fig Tree

[1:06:42] smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come
[1:06:47] away all right Revelations
[1:06:51] 41 a message went forth a message to
[1:06:55] call the bride a message has gone out
[1:06:57] how many believe that what's it doing it
[1:07:00] for calling a bride into that Union
[1:07:02] calling a bride into that love affair
[1:07:04] calling calling her come away come away

[1:07:58] where Heaven consists of what the word

[1:09:53] something's going to happen there's
[1:09:54] something Supernatural going to happen
[1:09:57] and brother brandham said in the message
[1:09:59] I well I can't remember what message but
[1:10:01] I'll read it something happened the
[1:10:02] other day I have the it's 41263 412
[1:10:06] evening if you want to look it up
[1:10:08] something happened the other day you
[1:10:10] read it you heard the tape seven
[1:10:12] Thunders what time is it sir he's asking
[1:10:15] what time is it sir and in that message
[1:10:17] that question was answered It's The End
[1:10:19] we're arrived it's the end it's the end
[1:10:21] of time it's the end it's the end we're
[1:10:23] we're
[1:10:23] here all right he said what time is it
[1:10:26] sir see and then he said again it
[1:10:29] happened the other day how do you know
[1:10:31] he said what happened the other day the
[1:10:33] seven Thunders it happened the other
[1:10:35] day and it's a supernatural
[1:10:38] event and the brother Pro Prophet called
[1:10:41] it a great event all right he said it
[1:10:44] happened the other day how do you know
[1:10:45] the Rapture is not going on all the
[1:10:49] time he said now you could you could say
[1:10:52] that there's a dual Revelation there we
[1:10:54] can say right now now because the
[1:10:55] Rapture is in progress how do you know
[1:10:57] the Rapture is not going on all the
[1:10:59] time and the last one will be caught
[1:11:01] away he says that just a moment I'll
[1:11:03] just read that all right but we also can
[1:11:05] say the Rapture can take place and there
[1:11:08] many won't even know it happened and
[1:11:10] he's saying to them how do you know the
[1:11:13] Rapture is not taking
[1:11:17] place amen all the time the bride is
[1:11:21] Forgiven she goes straight to glory in a
[1:11:24] rapture
[1:11:26] she goes straight to glory in a Rapture
[1:11:28] brother Bram said Revelation 4:1 is a
[1:11:33] Rapture amen I believe that don't you
[1:11:37] but how's the Rapture what how what
[1:11:39] happens the Rapture is taking place and
[1:11:41] there's conditions for that Rapture
[1:11:43] found in Psalms
[1:11:45] 27 brother Ram said that the condition
[1:11:48] let's read Psalm 27 the conditions for
[1:11:50] the Rapture he said he read that message
[1:11:52] hide me away I'm hid in his Pavilion in
[1:11:54] the SEC secret of his Tabernacle he
[1:11:57] hides me Rapture I'm raptured it's
[1:11:59] progressing it's growing in the bride
[1:12:01] it's growing there's a union growing
[1:12:04] coming to a full Union and a body change
[1:12:08] we're on our
[1:12:09] way now this is contrary to every
[1:12:12] Theologian every seminary in the country
[1:12:14] God never planned seminaries he didn't
[1:12:16] give seminaries in fact Satan that
[1:12:19] serpent that's what he fed to Eve his
[1:12:21] Seminary his theological teaching and
[1:12:24] knowledge of the word word and just
[1:12:26] change one word surely you'll not die
[1:12:28] God said they would and when she
[1:12:31] accepted that they died and she brought
[1:12:33] forth a cane which was not Adam's
[1:12:37] son
[1:12:39] right no place in the scripture does say
[1:12:41] Cain Adam was Cain's father no place not
[1:12:45] one place it said he was of the evil one
[1:12:47] that's right he was a different seed
[1:12:49] than it than
[1:12:51] than Abel right because Abel by
[1:12:54] revelation offered of of sacrifice and
[1:12:57] Cain wouldn't receive it though God said
[1:12:59] you you would be okay if you would
[1:13:00] receive it and offer it like Abel did
[1:13:02] but he refused it he put the word out he
[1:13:05] would not let the word have his
[1:13:08] way why because of
[1:13:11] knowledge human his own religious
[1:13:15] knowledge Eve was deceived amen what
[1:13:19] started to fall the woman she turned
[1:13:21] around and gave to the man and he
[1:13:23] partook because Adam had to Adam was not
[1:13:26] deceived Adam knew what he was doing
[1:13:28] Adam knew that when he partook like this
[1:13:30] death would set in on the earth is that
[1:13:34] right but what did he do it for because
[1:13:37] because because of the Redemption
[1:13:40] promise had to come to pass there had to
[1:13:44] be one come that was born of a woman
[1:13:46] that would be without sexual and would
[1:13:49] be born virgin and he and the and his
[1:13:52] Bible said were were born were saved by
[1:13:54] the blood of God Jesus was not Jew Jesus
[1:13:58] was not of a of Jacob Jesus was not of
[1:14:01] Eve I mean excuse me
[1:14:03] Mary
[1:14:06] amen no sir it wasn't Mary Zan it wasn't
[1:14:09] Joseph's germ it was a spoken word birth
[1:14:12] and she the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] will how's this going to be the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost will overshadow you and that Holy
[1:14:18] one that will be born of you will be the
[1:14:20] will be Emanuel Son of God Christ the
[1:14:23] word and she that said so be it your
[1:14:26] handmaid so be it unto me according to
[1:14:28] thy denomination thy teaching no
[1:14:30] according to Thy
[1:14:34] word amen is that right Let It Be
[1:14:37] according to Thy word Lord and she
[1:14:40] conceived and she went to Elizabeth
[1:14:43] Elizabeth's house said how can this be
[1:14:45] you mean you don't you I thought you and
[1:14:47] Joseph weren't married we're
[1:14:50] not and you're bearing a a child yes yes
[1:14:55] this is what God
[1:14:56] Said talk about unusual talk about
[1:15:01] strange amen but the Bible said a virgin
[1:15:04] shall conceive why was it virgin Why
[1:15:07] didn't it come like any other
[1:15:11] man but he had to come to a woman to
[1:15:14] reverse the crime in order for the Holy
[1:15:17] One to shed his blood and give himself
[1:15:19] just like Adam did to save Eve he had to
[1:15:22] have as germ broke in her amen or God
[1:15:25] would have destroyed her but because of
[1:15:27] his love for her he gave his life for
[1:15:29] her and lost the headship over the
[1:15:34] Earth okay enough of that I don't know
[1:15:36] why I'm saying that but anyway you know
[1:15:37] where we're going
[1:15:39] now and why we believe what we believe
[1:15:41] we believe the word of God the blood of
[1:15:44] Jesus Christ is what redeemed you and I
[1:15:47] and faith in that blood brings forth the
[1:15:49] Holy Spirit of that blood to come and
[1:15:52] live in you that's the new birth
[1:15:56] yes amen that's the real
[1:16:00] birth that's the token that you and I
[1:16:03] must have without that token you will
[1:16:06] never see a change of your body you can
[1:16:08] be justified you can be Sanctified and
[1:16:11] not have the Holy Ghost you can shout
[1:16:14] You Can Dance you can cast out Devils
[1:16:16] you can speak in tongues and prophesy
[1:16:18] and it be right and still not have the
[1:16:20] Holy Ghost and go to hell your spirit
[1:16:24] realm your Spirit man can be Anointed
[1:16:26] with a genuine anointing of the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost and that Soul still be as black as
[1:16:30] soot because it's a wrong
[1:16:33] seed so who are we saying that'll be the
[1:16:36] ones riding following him on white
[1:16:37] horses that elected seed that elected
[1:16:42] bride she can follow no other she has to
[1:16:45] follow him and she's going to follow him
[1:16:48] right into a Rapture right into a body
[1:16:50] change right into the re Resurrection
[1:16:53] itself
[1:16:55] because what's happened in I inside of
[1:16:57] us is a resurrection it's already risen
[1:17:00] what a resurrection that was when Jesus
[1:17:02] raised up when he raised up I raised
[1:17:04] with him when he came out of the Grave I
[1:17:07] came with him because I was in him there
[1:17:09] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:17:11] bodily and every one of his children
[1:17:13] were in him then in seed
[1:17:16] form amen
[1:17:20] exactly all right so so you see here
[1:17:23] there's a door been open and another
[1:17:25] voice said come up higher come up hither
[1:17:27] come away my love
[1:17:29] am all right now so Revelations
[1:17:34] 18 4-8 said very similar he said another
[1:17:39] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:17:41] my people and be not partakers of her
[1:17:44] sins that receive not of her plagues the
[1:17:46] light has come walk in the light come
[1:17:49] out of her that dark
[1:17:53] denominationalism come out of her
[1:17:55] it come out of her her come out of her
[1:17:59] who's her
[1:18:02] daughters come out of that
[1:18:03] denominational sister come out of her
[1:18:06] always in the Bible she was represented
[1:18:08] as a
[1:18:11] church she is the church why because
[1:18:13] that's exactly what the church the
[1:18:15] church is the one that
[1:18:17] fell amen deceived beguiled is that
[1:18:21] right that's
[1:18:23] right he amen amen amen you see what I
[1:18:27] don't can't go any further with that but
[1:18:29] you see what took place why Adam had to
[1:18:32] take
[1:18:33] her showing Redemption God took us
[1:18:36] because he loved us we were in him to
[1:18:38] begin with he poured out his life for us
[1:18:42] amen is that right he took he took the
[1:18:45] Judgment we stand the bride the bride of
[1:18:47] Christ stands no judgment she'll never
[1:18:49] stand before a white throne and be
[1:18:53] judged in fact the said know you not
[1:18:55] that the Saints shall
[1:18:58] judge okay hold that because the Saints
[1:19:01] shall
[1:19:02] judge where's the Judgment given to the
[1:19:05] Saints and we can't even you said you
[1:19:08] can't even decide from just things that
[1:19:10] come up in the church and you you take
[1:19:12] it to a law here and take it between men
[1:19:14] instead of taking it to the bride that
[1:19:16] could ought to be able to judge that
[1:19:17] difference and discern what is right and
[1:19:21] wrong is that right all right
[1:19:26] now oh my there so much see keeps
[1:19:30] opening so
[1:19:34] in I'll just read this further since I'm
[1:19:36] in the 18th chapter verse 6 reward her
[1:19:39] for her sins he said come out of her and
[1:19:41] be not partakers of her sins you receive
[1:19:43] not of her plagues for her sins have
[1:19:45] reached into heaven and God hath
[1:19:47] remembered her iniquities iniquity is
[1:19:49] doing knowing to do good and will not do
[1:19:51] it reward her even as she reward Ed you
[1:19:55] and double look at look at who's who's
[1:19:57] this given to speaking of the Bride
[1:19:59] speaking come out of her because she
[1:20:02] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[1:20:05] double under her double according to her
[1:20:07] works in the cup which she hath filled
[1:20:10] fill to her
[1:20:13] double think of that all right
[1:20:17] therefore I'm just skipping
[1:20:21] here well not I won't how much more how
[1:20:24] much has she hath glorified herself and
[1:20:26] lived deliciously so much torment and
[1:20:28] sorrow give her for she hath said in her
[1:20:31] heart I sit as a queen and no Widow and
[1:20:34] shall see no sorrow that's exactly
[1:20:36] that's
[1:20:37] exactly leoa I'm rich have need of
[1:20:41] nothing and know you not the Bible said
[1:20:43] that you're blind wretched naked
[1:20:45] miserable and don't know
[1:20:49] it should I say it yeah I guess I
[1:20:52] will he said if if that woman and not
[1:20:55] only the church spiritual is naked
[1:20:57] because you see the woman of the world
[1:20:59] out there the way they are dressed and
[1:21:00] naked absolutely nude I mean
[1:21:05] nude right and then what are that what's
[1:21:07] that showing the condition of the church
[1:21:13] natural she's naked she's blind she's

[1:22:38] 11 we see something taking place here
[1:22:43] portrayed amen first of all I point you
[1:22:46] to the fact that verse
[1:22:50] 11 Jesus was asked to come and because
[1:22:54] lazarus's friend was sick and he was
[1:22:57] asked to come and he kept delaying he
[1:22:59] wouldn't come and then after 4 days I
[1:23:02] think it was he said after that he he
[1:23:05] these things said he after that he saith
[1:23:08] unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth
[1:23:11] but I go that I may awake him out of
[1:23:14] sleep
[1:23:16] Matthew well he said and then they said
[1:23:18] well he does good if he sleeps he do
[1:23:21] well Jesus spake of his death they
[1:23:23] thought that he had spoken of of the
[1:23:24] rest of his rest and sleep then said
[1:23:27] Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is
[1:23:31] dead why did he say the little daughter
[1:23:33] she's not dead she sleeps why did he
[1:23:35] talk to Lazarus sleeping because he rose
[1:23:38] up the Lazarus went in the grave came
[1:23:41] out of the Grave amen is that right the
[1:23:43] Jesus that when in the grave comes out
[1:23:44] of the grave and these Believers that
[1:23:46] are in the grave right here sleeping now
[1:23:48] today will rise out of there
[1:23:51] amen amen just exactly what he said said
[1:23:54] if the spirit that raised up Jesus from

[1:24:00] body yes by his spirit that dwth in
[1:24:04] you he say Well they're gone they're
[1:24:06] gone on well but that spirit's still on
[1:24:08] them bones Elijah died and was thrown in
[1:24:11] a pit too and a man was running for his
[1:24:13] life away from the enemy and they threw
[1:24:15] the man into the pit because they
[1:24:16] couldn't carry him and get away from the
[1:24:18] enemy and soon as he hit those bones he
[1:24:20] raised
[1:24:21] up find that in the scripture it's in
[1:24:23] there
[1:24:25] where was that quickening
[1:24:27] power amen it was on those bones why
[1:24:31] because God dwelt in
[1:24:33] Elijah if God could do that under the
[1:24:35] Bulls sacrifice of bulls and goats what
[1:24:37] about the literal Christ himself the
[1:24:38] life of God living in you if it raised
[1:24:41] him out of the Grave did not it say it

[1:37:05] what his
[1:37:08] coming amen all right even him whose
[1:37:11] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:37:13] with all power and signs and lying
[1:37:15] wonders and all deceivableness of
[1:37:17] unrighteousness and them that perish in
[1:37:19] them that perish because they they
[1:37:21] receive not the love of the truth truth
[1:37:23] that they might be saved and this cause
[1:37:26] God shall give them strong delusion that
[1:37:28] they should believe a lie and that they
[1:37:30] all might be damned who believed not the
[1:37:33] truth but had pleasure in

[1:37:42] now Ephesians
[1:37:45] 5 I'm going to get there pretty quick
[1:37:47] here now so Ephesians 5 my I didn't
[1:37:50] realize the time you'll have to give me
[1:37:52] a few more minutes here Ephesians 5 is
[1:37:56] I've got to make this
[1:37:59] stick and if you're in a hurry then if
[1:38:01] you need to make a uh place you need to
[1:38:04] go or you got to make a a a some way of
[1:38:08] make an appointment or something that's
[1:38:11] fine just pick up the message and hear
[1:38:13] it on as it archived all
[1:38:17] right 2 Corinthians I'm sorry Ephesians
[1:38:21] Ephesians 5
[1:38:31] and verse
[1:38:32] 27 that he might present it talking
[1:38:35] about his bride a wife a wife this is
[1:38:38] spiritual brother Paul said I speak
[1:38:40] concerning Christ in the church but
[1:38:41] representing as the natural between
[1:38:43] husband and wife that he might present
[1:38:45] it to himself a glorious church not
[1:38:47] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:38:50] but that it should be holy and without
[1:38:52] blemish now I want to Song of Solomon
[1:38:55] you don't have to turn I'm going back
[1:38:57] over there just a quick moment in
[1:38:58] chapter 4 and look what the look what
[1:39:01] the the bridegroom says to his
[1:39:07] bride in chapter 4 in 4 verse 7 Thou Art
[1:39:13] all fair my love there is no spot in
[1:39:19] thee there is no spot in thee this is
[1:39:23] who I'm Fallen away amen without blemish
[1:39:26] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:39:28] their own bodies so you see whose body
[1:39:30] we are he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:39:33] himself for no man yet hated his own
[1:39:35] flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth even
[1:39:38] as the Lord the church for we are
[1:39:40] members of his body of his flesh and of
[1:39:42] his bones for this cause shall a man
[1:39:44] leave father and mother and shall be
[1:39:45] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[1:39:48] be one flesh this is a great mystery but
[1:39:50] I speak concerning Christ and the church
[1:39:55] amen if you're ordained on that ground
[1:39:57] the holy spirit's here to find you and
[1:39:59] when it finds you you recognize its call
[1:40:01] you know the hour you're living you know
[1:40:03] what these things are these things are
[1:40:04] supposed to happen quickly you're
[1:40:06] raptured up to meet it hello hello
[1:40:11] quickly you're raptured up to meet it
[1:40:13] now you're setting in Heavenly places in
[1:40:15] Christ
[1:40:18] Jesus what are you above condemnation
[1:40:21] there's no judgment for the bride
[1:40:22] because her judgment was paid in Christ
[1:40:25] Christ took her
[1:40:27] judgment he was the fullness of the
[1:40:29] godhead bodily so you were in him then
[1:40:32] you had to be in him then that's right
[1:40:35] amen all right I I I got to back off of
[1:40:38] that all right
[1:40:46] now as I said there's a summon he calls
[1:40:48] for his Queen to come stand by his side
[1:40:52] is that right
[1:40:53] what what did his call come through he
[1:40:56] calls for his Queen to come stand by his
[1:40:58] side know you not that's in the message
[1:41:00] the breach he said know you not that
[1:41:02] Saints shall judge the
[1:41:04] Earth amen so I I took care of
[1:41:07] Revelation 3 I'm missing I'm bypassing
[1:41:09] some of this
[1:41:14] now I want you to turn with me and I'll
[1:41:16] come back to this in a moment but come
[1:41:18] with me over to Revelations 12 I know
[1:41:21] there's a lot of scriptures here but
[1:41:22] we've got to see it in here

[1:42:21] night and they overcame him how did they
[1:42:24] overcome him by the blood of of the lamb
[1:42:27] and By The
[1:42:30] Sword and by the word of their
[1:42:34] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:42:37] unto the
[1:42:40] death notice how he he will he would
[1:42:43] given a heart of a beast at that time
[1:42:45] Satan will incarnate himself because
[1:42:46] when the church goes up Satan's cast out

[1:44:01] Witnesses unto me for you were with me
[1:44:02] from the
[1:44:03] beginning and the beginning was the word
[1:44:07] and if he was writing the white
[1:44:08] revelation of the word the word itself
[1:44:10] and had life in him then what about you
[1:44:13] right exactly

[1:44:59] hour I'm quoting you from Christ The
[1:45:01] Mystery of God revealed that's exactly I
[1:45:04] think it's paragraph 233 now we see that
[1:45:06] promise being
[1:45:08] fulfilled this day this
[1:45:11] scripture is being fulfilled in your
[1:45:19] midst and and they and they they had
[1:45:22] that test Tony therefore Rejoice ye
[1:45:24] heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to
[1:45:27] the inhabitant of the earth and the Sea
[1:45:28] The Devil's come down unto you now he's
[1:45:30] come down incarnate in a beast the
[1:45:33] bride's gone because she overcame him by
[1:45:35] the
[1:45:36] word and that word that word that come
[1:45:39] out of of God's own mouth the body the
[1:45:42] bride and I've got a quote on that
[1:45:45] brother Ram said that's exactly what it
[1:45:46] would
[1:45:49] be what are we growing up into Who We
[1:45:52] Are
[1:45:53] what are we growing up into our position
[1:45:55] our
[1:45:57] place it's so good to see oursel
[1:45:59] positionally placed where are we
[1:46:01] positionally placed in Christ Christ in
[1:46:05] you and that day this day that
[1:46:08] Revelation would take a hold you'd know
[1:46:10] that I'm in you and you and me and if
[1:46:12] I'm in you and you and me and my word in
[1:46:14] you and you and me then ask speak what
[1:46:16] you will and it shall be
[1:46:19] done then where does the authority lay
[1:46:21] the authority lays in the word revealed
[1:46:24] in the
[1:46:25] bride that's her
[1:46:30] Authority all
[1:46:32] right and when the dragon saw now he's
[1:46:36] now the devil has come down unto you
[1:46:37] having great wrath because he knoweth
[1:46:39] that he hath but a short time and when
[1:46:41] the dragon saw that he was cast out into
[1:46:43] the Earth he P he persecuted the woman
[1:46:46] which brought forth the Manchild who's
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:50] Israel he goes out to persecute
[1:46:54] Israel the bride's gone
[1:46:59] yeah you see where we're at here yes
[1:47:02] we're almost ready to be caught up with
[1:47:04] the rest of them but what's
[1:47:07] happening we overcome by the word of our
[1:47:10] own
[1:47:12] testimony what's our testimony Jesus
[1:47:15] Christ is our
[1:47:18] testimony the white horse rider is our
[1:47:21] testimony it's
[1:47:28] Christ all right let's get let's get to
[1:47:31] a couple key points and then I'll I'll
[1:47:34] close now look as long as that in
[1:47:37] intercessor on the throne Satan can't
[1:47:39] stand there and accuse because the
[1:47:41] attorney on the other side he's an
[1:47:42] opponent to
[1:47:43] Christ amen okay I think we realize that
[1:47:47] it's Satan said they're guilty Jesus
[1:47:50] said they're not I just read it to you
[1:47:51] they're Guiltless sinless Song of
[1:47:53] Solomon said there's not even a spot in
[1:47:55] you you're a garden enclosed you're
[1:47:58] living water flowing
[1:48:01] up amen 12th verse of that same chapter
[1:48:05] Song of Solomon 4 all right so what is
[1:48:08] it now brother sister it's Awakening
[1:48:10] time she's caught up away in secret
[1:48:12] she's going up marching Satan is being
[1:48:14] is being cast out how by the
[1:48:16] manifestation of the promised word for
[1:48:18] the hour he's being cast
[1:48:21] out the condition s cast him out the
[1:48:24] revelation of the word binds
[1:48:27] him faith is the key and that messenger
[1:48:30] come with that faith and imparted it to
[1:48:32] us opened the door letting us see who we
[1:48:36] were that spoken word we are that word
[1:48:39] living the bride is the word living and
[1:48:42] in

[1:49:07] inside that will punctuate the word hang
[1:49:09] with the word regardless she is the word
[1:49:11] living in action his own his own life
[1:49:16] amen I could read 1 Corinthians 4:19 but
[1:49:19] the Bible said the kingdom of God is the
[1:49:21] word made Power

[1:49:24] you all right what are we doing we're
[1:49:27] following him we're taking the same rout
[1:49:29] route he took when he putteth forth his
[1:49:31] bride verse chapter 10 of St John verse
[1:49:34] 4 and five when he putteth forth his
[1:49:36] bride he goeth before them amen and they
[1:49:39] follow him because why they know his
[1:49:44] voice to know something is to have it
[1:49:46] they have his voice they know his voice
[1:49:49] and a stranger they will not follow for
[1:49:52] they know not the voice of a

[1:50:40] move is on for the bride see the move is
[1:50:42] on the mystery of God Revelation 10:7
[1:50:45] the mystery of God should be finish and
[1:50:47] that's what the Bible has been it's been
[1:50:48] a work of God that's been covered up and
[1:50:50] it's been hid since the foundation of
[1:50:52] the world and its Sevenfold mystery of
[1:50:55] God promised at this day in the age of
[1:50:58] the leosan church he would take the mask
[1:51:01] off the whole thing and we could see it
[1:51:03] what a glorious
[1:51:05] thing all right what is it God in morphe

[1:51:56] tent brother Braham said changed his
[1:51:58] tent and come down and lived with us
[1:52:00] become one of us we beheld him we held
[1:52:03] him the Bible said 1 Timothy 3:16
[1:52:05] without controversy great is a mystery
[1:52:07] of godliness for God was manifest In the
[1:52:09] Flesh handled with hands what about
[1:52:14] today his bride is not another as bright
[1:52:17] as himself he's just masked himself in
[1:52:20] Bride form
[1:52:23] brother Brown said this message is
[1:52:24] growing in a bride and is coming forth
[1:52:27] in the formation of a bride for she's
[1:52:29] the word manifested for this season not
[1:52:32] another season she's the revelation of
[1:52:34] Jesus Christ for this hour and it's
[1:52:38] growing in
[1:52:40] her praise the
[1:52:42] Lord I told you this is heavy but it's
[1:52:45] the truth it's the truth and the bride
[1:52:48] loves it I'm not saying who is and who
[1:52:51] isn't I pray we're all bride
[1:52:53] yes but if you're bride you're going to
[1:52:55] hear what the spirit's saying in this
[1:52:56] day to these churches this church amen
[1:52:59] amen that's it it's not what I do what
[1:53:02] you think what I think about it it's
[1:53:04] God's work it's God's achievement it's
[1:53:06] God's doing either you have an ear or
[1:53:08] you don't have an
[1:53:10] ear I can't make you have an ear you
[1:53:12] can't make yourself have an ear it's God
[1:53:15] the quality of God that was a special
[1:53:17] class of people that had the ability to
[1:53:19] hear what God said that's all there is
[1:53:21] to it that's that's special class and
[1:53:23] that's the quality God gives them to him
[1:53:26] is his
[1:53:28] faith his substance that's the
[1:53:31] quality is the substance of that promise
[1:53:35] that word Christ in you the hope of
[1:53:38] glory
[1:53:40] amen amen all right so we see the
[1:53:43] Promise being fulfilled now that was God
[1:53:46] above us God With Us God ate meat God
[1:53:48] drank water God slept God cried he was
[1:53:51] one of us beautiful type in the Bible
[1:53:54] amen so that was God above us God With
[1:53:57] Us now it's God in
[1:53:59] us the Holy Spirit not a third person
[1:54:02] the same
[1:54:04] person no we don't believe in a trinity
[1:54:07] you can have all your Trinity you want
[1:54:08] it come from the devil came from the
[1:54:10] pits of Hell started through the Beast
[1:54:13] and that's what it is we believe in a
[1:54:14] true baptism in Water by in the name not
[1:54:17] in names the name of Jesus Christ that's
[1:54:20] right
[1:54:22] amen and you shall receive the gift of
[1:54:24] the Holy Ghost which is in you to begin
[1:54:26] with that Quicken that Holy Ghost comes
[1:54:28] quickens that seed and brings that seed
[1:54:31] to life and it's God in you just as I
[1:54:33] said now it's God in you not another
[1:54:35] person God above us God With Us his son
[1:54:38] God in you the same God not two or three
[1:54:41] Gods the same God
[1:54:44] amen amen that started from the devil
[1:54:47] way back from the
[1:54:49] beginning
[1:54:50] never did God ever say that here o
[1:54:54] Israel the Lord thy God is one God right
[1:54:56] and thou shalt have no other gods before
[1:54:58] me
[1:55:01] that's so you don't have one God the
[1:55:03] spirit God the son if that's the case
[1:55:05] who is Jesus's father because the Bible
[1:55:07] said the Holy Ghost was his father
[1:55:09] that's right so that makes the father
[1:55:10] somebody
[1:55:15] else amen he said the Holy Ghost will
[1:55:17] overshadow you I thought father I
[1:55:19] thought God was his father well then the
[1:55:21] Holy Ghost and God must be a different
[1:55:27] person you see where you get yourself
[1:55:29] mixed up bu of theology is what it is a
[1:55:32] trinitarian spirit which is nothing but
[1:55:34] the devil and from the pits of hell you
[1:55:36] said you'll suffer for that someday I
[1:55:38] may suffer for it but I've got a body
[1:55:40] waiting amen amen I may suffer but
[1:55:43] remember the prophet said fear not
[1:55:45] little flock you will
[1:55:48] endure the truth will separate the truth
[1:55:51] sets free
[1:55:56] amen all right so it's not another
[1:56:00] person not a third person it's the same
[1:56:02] person that's right it's God in three
[1:56:04] offices brother sister you're a Triune
[1:56:06] being you're Soul you have a spirit and
[1:56:09] you have a
[1:56:10] body amen but you're one person that's
[1:56:16] right it's all there is to it
[1:56:20] right all right
[1:56:23] now first seal he said we see the
[1:56:25] Promise being fulfilled Christ the true
[1:56:27] headship going in going up marching

[1:56:41] aware of it you don't have to make me
[1:56:43] aware of it I'm well aware of
[1:56:46] it remember this the only the only thing
[1:56:50] that these things are
[1:56:53] R is the display of his attributes you
[1:56:55] have an attribute it's your thought and
[1:56:57] you think something then you speak it
[1:56:58] you take it that's God in the beginning
[1:57:01] if you ever was or ever will be in
[1:57:02] heaven you was in heaven to start
[1:57:10] with and they that were in
[1:57:13] heaven followed him yes on white horses
[1:57:17] Revelations
[1:57:20] 19:14 if you was if you was ever if you
[1:57:23] ever will be in
[1:57:25] heaven you was in heaven to start with
[1:57:29] that's what your Prophet told you you're
[1:57:32] a part of God you were his
[1:57:35] thought on page six Now watch how we
[1:57:38] overcome by the word of Our
[1:57:40] Testimony now we had him coming last
[1:57:43] night with his great sword to
[1:57:46] kill amen talking about the beast on
[1:57:49] that on that black horse I yeah black
[1:57:53] horse we find out that he gets killed
[1:57:55] with the sword

[1:58:28] the heavens they can shut this or do
[1:58:31] that whatever they want to he said Glory
[1:58:35] he will be slayed by the word that
[1:58:37] proceeds from his
[1:58:40] mouth it's sharper than a two-edged
[1:58:43] sword they they could call for a 100
[1:58:46] billion tons of flies if they wanted to
[1:58:50] amen whatever they say going to happen
[1:58:54] because it's the word of God coming from
[1:58:57] the mouth of
[1:58:58] God Amen who is
[1:59:01] she the mouth of
[1:59:05] God where's his voice it's he in her he

[2:14:50] want to say something you may may not

[2:14:56] only one original color anything else is
[2:14:58] mixed Christ is on a solid white
[2:15:00] unadulterated word from the beginning

[2:15:04] chemistry hadn't broke into it amen
[2:15:07] glory every Church would be standing on

[2:15:10] God and God confirming it if it didn't
[2:15:12] have Creeds and denominations mixed into
[2:15:14] it there you are only one original color
[2:15:17] that's white it never mixed with
[2:15:19] denomination or Creeds no sir
[2:15:22] amen and remember His Saints are clothed
[2:15:25] in white robes not mixed with
[2:15:28] denomination of Creeds now we find out
[2:15:30] the denomination of Creeds here's what
[2:15:32] you get your mixed color but this is the
[2:15:34] original color he's writing the original
[2:15:37] color is on his people and they've been
[2:15:39] dipped in Blood and cleansed that
[2:15:41] garment and set it right back Yonder
[2:15:43] that's right now what's he doing

[2:15:49] battle those that mix turn pale and go
[2:15:51] to death there you are those that mix
[2:15:54] with white turn pale and go to death
[2:15:56] it's perverting perversion to mix colors
[2:15:58] with white you pervert the original
[2:16:01] color you mix anything with it you
[2:16:03] pervert
[2:16:04] it no matter how good it may seem how
[2:16:07] reasonable how right truth and error
[2:16:09] won't
[2:16:10] mix it cannot mix it's either thus saith
[2:16:13] the Lord there you are or it's wrong
[2:16:15] they have thus sayeth the Lord or they
[2:16:17] keep still he works in and through his
[2:16:19] bride no matter what Holy Father father
[2:16:21] said St bonfice or Archbishop of
[2:16:23] Canterbury I don't know who said it if
[2:16:25] it's contrary to the word it's
[2:16:26] perversion it won't
[2:16:29] mix you can't mix
[2:16:32] it now you go back to what he said in
[2:16:35] Revelations 12 amen and I just read that
[2:16:38] to you it'll slice a cut they can call
[2:16:40] for okay now I'm closing I'm coming down
[2:16:42] the end you say praise the Lord can't B
[2:16:45] say praise the
[2:16:46] Lord
[2:16:48] good so I I just if I keep going I don't
[2:16:51] hear praise the Lord but if I stop it's
[2:16:53] praise the Lord so I'm glad and I say
[2:16:55] praise the Lord too because I want to
[2:16:56] get this off my
[2:16:58] chest all right now watch you you've
[2:17:02] heard what the circumstance
[2:17:06] is the messenger got through with the
[2:17:08] message now in the heart of the Bride
[2:17:11] where' that message go into the heart of
[2:17:12] the Bride how many know that's
[2:17:15] so what God thought had it hid in the
[2:17:18] back part of his mind is now in the
[2:17:20] bride it's now in the heart of the Bride
[2:17:22] he's in he's he's tabernacled himself in
[2:17:25] Bride form when once he was when once he
[2:17:28] was as Jesus in flesh it's now it's now
[2:17:33] I forget how the wording was but it's
[2:17:34] now in the flesh of the Bride amen amen
[2:17:38] all right so now in the heart of the
[2:17:41] Bride the what is in the heart of the
[2:17:43] Bride testimony spoken revelation of the
[2:17:46] word the key Revelations 21 I won't read
[2:17:48] it 20 verse1 all right now now

[2:17:55] always uses man to work it they're going
[2:17:57] to

[2:18:04] notice life followed Rider on White
[2:18:06] Horse who is the word life Vindicated
[2:18:09] Vindicated how by his resurrected saints
[2:18:12] that he had with

[2:18:16] ways yes you
[2:18:17] can you can say it's after the
[2:18:19] resurrection and I can say it's also
[2:18:22] before the resurrection because we had a
[2:18:24] prophet say what a resurrection that was
[2:18:26] and what a resurrection this
[2:18:29] is how many believe is the resurrection
[2:18:31] and life shall never die you've passed
[2:18:33] then you've passed you've
[2:18:35] risen fact he said you've risen over and
[2:18:38] over again all right now his resurrected
[2:18:41] Saints he had with him now how's the
[2:18:42] battle now how's the battle going to go
[2:18:45] Jesus said he that believeth in me
[2:18:46] though he were dead yet shall he live if
[2:18:48] you believe in me and though you were
[2:18:49] dead and who whoever liveth and
[2:18:51] believeth in me shall never die he said
[2:18:53] that's how the battle's going to
[2:18:54] go see he's talking about his
[2:18:57] resurrected Saints he had with him now
[2:18:59] how's the battle going to go he that
[2:19:00] believeth in me there it is who believes
[2:19:03] in Him in him in him not believing about
[2:19:08] him but who's believing in him amen
[2:19:10] again he said he that believeth he will
[2:19:12] give him eternal life and raise him up
[2:19:14] at the last day that's his promise
[2:19:16] scripture he'll raise him up at the last
[2:19:18] day how many's been risen rise shine for
[2:19:21] thy light is come and not only that if I
[2:19:23] go in the grave he'll raise me up at the

[2:23:30] Jesus called
[2:23:32] Christ what are we going to do with this
[2:23:34] one leading us directing us guiding us
[2:23:38] are you willing to follow him are you
[2:23:39] willing to take up your cross and die to
[2:23:41] your own reasoning and your sense bound
[2:23:44] senses that you're in and give that up
[2:23:46] and quit looking at the outside and take
[2:23:48] that word what your heart say what is
[2:23:51] your soul saying this
[2:23:54] morning where are you going to stand are
[2:23:57] you willing to separate even from Family
[2:24:00] House lands daughter sister mother wife
[2:24:03] are you willing to separate from all of
[2:24:04] it and say Lord I'm going to take you at
[2:24:06] your word I'm going to follow one way
[2:24:09] and that's through your word and your
[2:24:11] word is my
[2:24:12] deliverance we could have spent a lot of
[2:24:14] time with that again but the first
[2:24:16] Wednesday we ministered here we took
[2:24:17] that stay with the word amen
[2:24:21] yes don't you add to it or take from it
[2:24:24] you just get a relationship with Jesus
[2:24:26] Christ and that deser will know exactly
[2:24:28] how you should answer come back to the
[2:24:30] word go back to what is written don't go
[2:24:33] back to your sense bound reasoning and
[2:24:35] your imagination your memory your
[2:24:37] conscience and you feel good and I feel
[2:24:38] good those are no those are no evidences
[2:24:41] that you have the Holy Ghost In You
[2:24:44] dwelling I don't care how much you
[2:24:46] prophesy how much you cast out Devils
[2:24:48] how much Jesus said they'd come in that
[2:24:50] day great preachers great workers
[2:24:53] casting out Devils speaking in tongues
[2:24:55] prophesying every one of those things
[2:24:58] and not the
[2:25:01] word so where does it lay it lays in the
[2:25:04] revelation of the word you said you just
[2:25:07] stepped on my toes Brother David
[2:25:10] good because you got to realize that
[2:25:13] it's the word or nothing that's right
[2:25:16] and that word's got to be revealed in
[2:25:17] you then talk with tongues then speak
[2:25:20] with the tongues then do those things
[2:25:22] and I have nothing against that but
[2:25:24] those things are not the evidence that
[2:25:25] you are born again
[2:25:29] right amen you don't think that's right
[2:25:32] you've been too long in this message not
[2:25:34] to know that he said that over and over
[2:25:36] and over again it's just that you won't
[2:25:38] receive
[2:25:40] it that's the problem we either receive
[2:25:42] it or we
[2:25:44] don't because it steps on our ego it
[2:25:47] steps on our feelings
[2:25:51] well you don't know how God dealt with
[2:25:52] me you don't know how God dealt with me
[2:25:54] but there's no evidence of that I can
[2:25:56] preach this gospel with a house of fire
[2:25:57] and be anointed to do it it's not the
[2:25:59] evidence that I'm going to
[2:26:03] Heaven by their fruit they are
[2:26:06] known and the fruit is the promised word
[2:26:09] for this season
[2:26:12] revealed in you and you'll bear that
[2:26:17] fruit the fruit of the Season you know
[2:26:20] them they're teaching they are false
[2:26:23] teachers they're false on the inside of
[2:26:25] the inside yet anointed preachers
[2:26:27] anointed teachers anointed every way
[2:26:30] anointed Anointed with the genuine Holy
[2:26:33] Ghost and be filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:26:35] every day of your life and still go to
[2:26:39] hell then what is the
[2:26:42] difference the word you have an ear to
[2:26:45] hear that word
[2:26:51] that's exactly where it
[2:26:52] lays you say well you don't love us I
[2:26:55] love you more than you realize I love
[2:26:57] you in God's Own love I'm trying to get
[2:26:59] you to see pull away from that sense
[2:27:02] bound things of feel-good feelings and
[2:27:06] come to the word quit trying to find
[2:27:09] your your happiness quit trying to find
[2:27:11] it in man's Theology and man's ideas
