[24:28] him i talked to brother richard drake
[24:30] uh yesterday and that he's doing much
[24:32] better
[24:33] uh they have done they didn't think it
[24:36] was possible to do a lung bypass
[24:38] so where they go through the artery in
[24:39] the leg and they take out all the carbon
[24:41] and they put it back in your neck
[24:43] so allows your lungs not to have to
[24:44] breathe and they can heal
[24:46] so they uh they were doing that and then
[24:48] they decided that he was strong enough
[24:50] they'd bring him out of his coma
[24:52] and they started to do that and he just
[24:53] woke right up the nurse said his eyes
[24:55] were sharp
[24:56] everything's so really thankful for the

[27:37] christ's name we pray
[27:38] amen then you can take your seats this
[27:46] morning
[27:49] uh the first thing i do want to say is
[27:51] that youth meeting was going to be this
[27:54] friday but we decided to
[27:56] cancel this the month of july we have
[27:59] 4th of july that weekend
[28:01] and the next weekend is the camping trip
[28:04] so give everybody a chance to get ready
[28:08] for that
[28:08] and enjoy their weekend the same thing
[28:12] goes for grace kids
[28:13] postponing that one so the next one will
[28:16] be august
[28:17] 6th so
[28:21] the camping trip we did some regrouping
[28:23] yesterday
[28:24] my wife and i for we tackled the good
[28:27] old google for about five hours along
[28:29] with
[28:30] and jerry and a couple other people to
[28:32] try to find a better location
[28:36] i realized that that probably was
[28:40] a little bit not as accessible as it
[28:42] needed to be the spot that we had
[28:44] originally picked
[28:45] so we searched around to find a better
[28:49] spot because it
[28:50] it's our desire to have time away
[28:52] together
[28:54] with god as a church and with our
[28:56] families and so i want
[28:59] everyone who can make it to be able to
[29:01] make that
[29:02] um it's very near and dear to our hearts
[29:05] we get
[29:05] to extend that opportunity to each one
[29:08] and i have
[29:09] nothing to prove so
[29:12] the new spot is a campground and it has
[29:15] a paved road
[29:16] the whole way to it cue the applause
[29:20] uh it also has a public restroom okay
[29:23] with the cheering
[29:25] so um you have those amenities there
[29:29] um it's two hours from napa or the old
[29:32] spot
[29:32] was an hour and 45 minutes so
[29:36] it's just a few minutes longer but um
[29:40] it's going to feel a lot faster because
[29:43] the 30 minutes on the dirt road to the
[29:44] old spot
[29:46] didn't feel like 30 minutes it felt like
[29:47] an hour
[29:49] so this way you just you'll head out of
[29:50] napa towards unity oregon
[29:52] is where it is we'll post the link
[29:54] there's several spots in the area
[29:57] we're going to go today this afternoon
[30:00] take a sunday drive and check the one we
[30:02] want to use and if it's good we'll post
[30:04] the link
[30:05] you're not going to need maps to get
[30:07] there because we can just use our
[30:09] our smartphones for smart enough to use
[30:12] them
[30:14] and it's just easier that way
[30:18] so the campground is first come first
[30:20] served so we cannot reserve
[30:22] it and all the group places we could
[30:23] reserve i mean
[30:25] if they're they're booked up you have to
[30:26] get on their january first
[30:28] pretty much to get anything within three
[30:30] or so hours
[30:32] so um our plan
[30:35] is to go out wednesday july 7th
[30:39] my wife and my family and then sister
[30:40] carrie and mason i think
[30:42] and we're going to show up and buy
[30:46] rent every spot so we have the whole
[30:47] campground um
[30:49] there's about nine spots so it's not
[30:50] unrealistic so anybody that can come out
[30:54] early thursday morning or early thursday
[30:56] if you can that would
[30:58] help we could get you a spot and that
[31:00] way that would kind of
[31:01] make sure that no one tries to come in
[31:04] to take our our spot there so
[31:08] the option for coming out on just sunday
[31:12] i feel like it's still okay it's only a
[31:15] couple hour drive
[31:16] and uh
[31:19] so you have be able to spend the whole
[31:21] day out there we're still going to go
[31:22] with that plan for those of you that
[31:23] want to do that
[31:24] we'll have a nice sunday morning service
[31:26] with brother rich
[31:28] and we'll have a sunday lunch all
[31:29] together just kind of spend the day out
[31:31] in the woods there and then
[31:33] we'll wrap up that sunday evening
[31:37] it's july 8th through july 11th so
[31:40] thursday through sunday
[31:42] and like i said brother rich will be
[31:44] coming with his family to join us for
[31:45] the weekend
[31:46] um he'll be speaking saturday evening at
[31:49] 7 pm
[31:50] going to give his testimony we'll
[31:52] probably not have like a full church
[31:54] service
[31:55] maybe a couple songs and then have him
[31:57] give his testimony
[31:59] and then sunday morning he's going to
[32:01] speak
[32:03] service at 10 30. for
[32:06] everyone that's joining us for dinners
[32:08] we kind of
[32:10] we're giving we're handing that option
[32:11] out you can if you want to
[32:13] and for sunday lunch kristen my wife
[32:16] will contact each of you
[32:18] for what to bring for that
[32:21] everyone that's coming you even on
[32:23] sunday you need to bring a chair for
[32:24] every person in your group
[32:27] that same chair is going to be what you
[32:29] will use for service so we'll just grab
[32:31] our
[32:31] camp chairs and set up for the services
[32:35] so make sure you have enough chairs for
[32:37] that also
[32:40] to not go over an exhaustive list of
[32:43] what to bring camping
[32:44] remember mosquito
[32:47] um
[32:51] and if you have any other questions you
[32:52] can feel free to
[32:54] ask on the whatsapp group or to text us
[32:57] directly or call us
[32:59] so it's a lot of information but we will
[33:01] post all this again
[33:03] and along with the spot once we go and
[33:06] check it and everything and make sure
[33:08] it's all good to go so we just ask that
[33:11] you
[33:12] join us in praying that we have the
[33:15] whole thing everything works out
[33:16] smoothly
[33:17] and uh thank you for being patient with
[33:20] us this is our first
[33:21] attempt at this and so every year i'll
[33:23] just get a little bit smoother
[33:25] we already have a place picked out for
[33:27] next year so we're going to be up
[33:29] january 1st to reserve that spot
[33:32] but this year this is what we have what
[33:34] we're going with so
[33:36] trust it'll work out trust the lord to
[33:37] work it out and if you can
[33:39] make the effort i believe god will match
[33:42] that
[33:42] effort and that expectation and it'll be
[33:45] more than just a
[33:46] campout it'll be a time to spend
[33:49] with with the lord um it's always a
[33:51] little bit easier out in the nature to
[33:52] connect with god
[33:53] so i believe that time is important to
[33:55] spend with him and with each other
[33:57] last year we had coven and we kind of
[33:59] broke the rules anyways but
[34:01] there's still a little bit of less
[34:03] fellowship
[34:04] sometimes but i think i think it's going
[34:07] to be a wonderful time so
[34:09] god bless y'all
[34:22] [Music]
[34:31] so many times lore
[34:35] i've done and said the wrong
[34:38] thing so
[34:42] many times lord i've been
[34:45] in the way
[34:50] but i thank you for your love
[34:55] and your mercy
[34:59] for without you i'd be
[35:03] unmolded clay
[35:08] it's you lord who gives me strength to
[35:12] face tomorrow
[35:16] it's you lord who saved and set me free
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] it's you lord when the trials
[35:40] [Music]
[35:47] like me
[35:50] i once was lost
[35:54] but now i'm found
[35:58] i was blind but now
[36:02] i see
[36:05] [Music]
[36:06] it's you lord who gives me strength to
[36:10] face tomorrow
[36:14] it's you lord who saved and set me free
[36:22] it's you lord when the trials rise
[36:26] around me
[36:27] [Music]

[36:32] me the way

[37:16] only year long
[37:25] [Music]
[37:34] i
[37:35] [Music]
[37:42] [Music]
[37:48] one more time
[37:51] [Music]
[38:02] yes
[38:11] [Music]
[38:16] foundation
[38:21] [Music]
[38:30] oh
[38:32] [Music]
[38:42] just speak that from your heart to the
[38:43] lord this morning amen
[39:04] [Music]
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] oh
[39:15] [Music]
[39:23] good to be in the house of the lord
[39:24] today amen god bless you brother david
[39:27] sister and i am sister ruth
[39:29] hope you had a a lovely time amen
[39:32] that's wonderful hallelujah just
[39:36] you know sometimes they say a change is
[39:39] as good as a vacation
[39:41] and so sometimes you need to get out and
[39:44] you know be able to
[39:45] see new faces and do new things and uh
[39:49] so i hope i say this right i don't
[39:53] really feel like chewing on my shoe this
[39:55] morning
[39:56] but you know brother chris when he when
[39:59] he come to me with this
[40:01] desire this idea of going camping or
[40:04] doing something different
[40:08] i personally thought it was a good idea
[40:10] uh we could just
[40:12] kind of break our normal mold kind of
[40:15] uh go out of our way a little bit um
[40:18] some might say well it's gonna be an
[40:20] extra effort
[40:22] well maybe you need to do an extra
[40:24] effort
[40:25] amen you know sometimes you know like
[40:27] when revival comes in the church you
[40:29] know you have special meetings revival
[40:31] comes in the church you know it never
[40:32] just happens
[40:34] right people exert effort they make
[40:36] plans they fulfill things they do
[40:38] and you know a young couple gets married
[40:42] you don't just show up on the saturday
[40:45] and the church is decorated
[40:47] somebody put effort into that and we're
[40:50] working on our marriage with the lord
[40:52] jesus christ and so
[40:53] i think it's good for us sometimes to
[40:55] put out the extra effort to
[40:58] uh put that and so uh brother chris made
[41:01] just a slight comment on that and i feel
[41:03] to elaborate on that a little bit
[41:06] uh saints have have mercy don't put
[41:08] brother chris
[41:09] on the uh on the altar and crucify him
[41:12] that this plan wasn't just so perfectly
[41:16] orchestrated
[41:17] because um it never just happened the
[41:20] first time
[41:22] uh a good example of that many years ago
[41:24] brother
[41:25] tim pruitt uh was recounting how
[41:28] somebody
[41:29] said my brother tim you know your youth
[41:32] camp is just goes
[41:33] flows so smoothly so good and brother
[41:36] tim said
[41:37] you should have been here for the first
[41:39] one you know
[41:40] at that point never thought we'd ever
[41:42] have another one
[41:44] it takes an effort and so let's
[41:48] not be what they call the armchair
[41:50] jockeys
[41:51] uh and sit back and say should have done
[41:53] this should have done this and if i had
[41:56] been in charge we would have done this
[41:57] but of course we would have forgot that
[42:01] so you know i'm just going to put a
[42:04] pitch in for the preacher
[42:06] how's that when you come to church
[42:10] don't be there saying he should have
[42:12] said this and he shouldn't have said
[42:13] that
[42:14] if we were all perfect we'd be walking
[42:16] the streets of gold this morning
[42:18] amen some might get there sooner than
[42:21] others
[42:22] hallelujah you know this is the way i
[42:24] choose to look at it saints
[42:26] uh our dear friend sister deborah walker
[42:28] you know passing away
[42:30] uh and i don't say this judgmentally i
[42:33] don't say this
[42:34] in anything but other its purest form so
[42:37] she had shared with sister jerry here
[42:40] recently she said somebody said oh
[42:42] sister deborah i'll meet you at the
[42:44] eastern gate and sister deborah's
[42:46] response was
[42:47] meet you at the eastern gate nothing
[42:48] god's going to heal me
[42:51] and i applaud that kind of faith
[42:55] but the critic could look at that and
[42:56] say they'll meet the eastern gate
[42:59] but you see my brother and sister we
[43:01] don't always know what tomorrow is and
[43:03] we don't have everything
[43:05] but one thing we know the word of god is
[43:07] life
[43:09] and he speaks life he encourages to
[43:12] reach for life
[43:13] and he encourages us to live life
[43:16] nowhere in the bible will you find jesus
[43:18] christ telling you
[43:20] or peter paul or john telling you go
[43:23] hole up
[43:23] in a hole somewhere and wait for the
[43:26] coming of the lord
[43:28] be a hermit no we were
[43:32] meant now i i i don't i'm not referring
[43:35] to anyone so
[43:36] nobody get a complex here but some of
[43:39] you need someone
[43:41] to rub on you amen
[43:44] as iron sharpeneth iron so doth
[43:48] grace tabernacle needs someone to rub
[43:51] on you amen we want everybody just to
[43:54] see it our way
[43:56] and no i won't sing the song that just
[43:58] flashed across my brain
[44:00] but my brother and sister when we get
[44:01] the idea it's all got to be our way
[44:04] we need to pray more amen so
[44:07] um we want to remember this coming
[44:09] saturday
[44:11] 6 p.m communion here at the church and
[44:14] i made that decision based on giving
[44:17] opportunity for the saints to enjoy
[44:20] i i believe it's still on brother trevor
[44:24] and sister kerry
[44:25] uh you know it was mentioned um maybe
[44:28] i'm presumptuous here
[44:29] brother trevor is like yeah i don't know
[44:33] sister kerry let me put her this way she
[44:36] wanted to host another fourth of july
[44:39] get together
[44:40] and uh brother trevor if that was out of
[44:43] line forgive me
[44:44] so um anyway um
[44:47] so we're we're gonna have communion on
[44:49] saturday evening
[44:51] and that way we'll give you uh the
[44:53] opportunity
[44:54] brother prashant sister koncha uh really
[44:57] wanted to be here for communion
[44:59] and because of the holiday weekend it
[45:02] was available to them so
[45:04] um we just we're not here in the
[45:06] accommodation business saints
[45:09] otherwise we have to start accommodating
[45:11] this family because they give more
[45:13] offering and we have to accommodate this
[45:14] family because they're the musicians and
[45:16] we have to accommodate this one
[45:18] because they claim the church and we
[45:19] have to no
[45:21] we're not in the accommodation business
[45:22] but at the same token
[45:24] we are not legalists hard and fast
[45:28] that we cannot make any change
[45:31] so that's what we're going to do
[45:34] if that's uncomfortable for someone you
[45:37] can
[45:37] talk to me about it i want to give
[45:40] greetings to you
[45:41] you won't know them but when sister
[45:44] jerry and i
[45:45] this last year went to
[45:48] go brain dead paul greeley colorado
[45:53] we met brother christian and sister
[45:57] mirna lovely lovely they come picked us
[46:00] up took us for dinner took us to a
[46:02] fellowship
[46:03] uh they weren't allowed to have church
[46:04] at that time because of the lockdown
[46:06] but um uh just a lovely time and so
[46:10] brother christian sends greetings from
[46:11] the saints there in greeley
[46:14] brother christian is um the assistant
[46:18] uh to his uh dad but
[46:21] his dad i believe is his visiting family
[46:23] in mexico and so he's been
[46:25] taking care of the church and just
[46:28] lovely brother and sister just
[46:29] very kindred spirits let's just stand as
[46:32] we go
[46:33] into the word of god today i want to
[46:38] speak to you this morning on preparing a
[46:40] place for the mercy seat
[46:42] and we're going to start right here as
[46:45] it were
[46:46] in the book of exodus we're looking
[46:49] today my brother and sister
[46:51] we do not have a physical tabernacle as
[46:55] it were a building
[46:57] that houses the mercy seat today but
[47:00] we'll see
[47:01] as we go into this uh topic of the mercy
[47:05] seat we will see how that god
[47:08] moves and how he has come and what he
[47:11] manifested
[47:12] uh in one sense my brother and sister
[47:14] you see now god
[47:16] is god and he changes not is that
[47:18] correct
[47:19] so what we'll see though that god moves
[47:22] in types and shadows
[47:24] right so god will use a representation
[47:27] over here and come and then we will see
[47:30] what the true interpretation of that
[47:32] representation
[47:33] was uh not in as it were physical form
[47:36] but then it's here
[47:38] in the spiritual and god gives us these
[47:40] examples and brother branham
[47:42] himself says i was i'm a typologist so
[47:45] we can take these types into scripture
[47:47] and uh we can look through that and
[47:50] find this and so let's turn in our
[47:52] bibles to
[47:54] exodus the 25th chapter uh we'll read
[47:57] from verse one through
[47:58] verse eight and i feel like i've
[48:02] forgotten something but i don't know
[48:04] what that would be so
[48:09] just well pray the lord if it's
[48:12] important would bring it back to
[48:14] my memory amen
[48:18] exodus 25 verses 1 through 8.
[48:22] can someone say it's good to be here
[48:23] this morning amen
[48:26] and the lord spake unto moses saying now
[48:29] i like this my brother and sister
[48:31] moses did not just have a thought
[48:36] moses didn't say um i think
[48:41] right this was god speaking
[48:45] speak unto the children of grace
[48:47] tabernacle
[48:50] that they bring me an offering of every
[48:52] man that giveth it willingly with his
[48:54] heart
[48:55] ye shall take my offering now let me
[48:58] read that correctly so no one will be
[49:00] offended
[49:01] speaking to the children of israel that
[49:03] they bring me
[49:04] an offering of every man
[49:08] that giveth it willingly with his heart
[49:11] he shall take
[49:12] my offering now i'm not going to expound
[49:15] on this but i want you to
[49:16] know saints that if you grudgingly reach
[49:20] into
[49:20] the purse or the pocket and you give
[49:24] unto the lord
[49:25] whether it's an offering whether it's
[49:27] ties or whatever it would be
[49:29] and you do that grudgingly
[49:33] there's no blessing the scripture
[49:37] shows us in the new testament
[49:41] that if the preacher preaches grudgingly
[49:45] there's no blessing but to the man who
[49:49] freely gives himself to preach the word
[49:51] of god
[49:53] now there's no quotation marks that says
[49:56] when he feels like it when it's easy
[49:58] when it's convenient or when it's
[50:00] accepted
[50:03] it's the difference of whether he does
[50:05] it from his heart
[50:07] or he does it grudgingly now saints the
[50:10] same applies to each one of us if we're
[50:12] here this morning
[50:13] with some kind of grudging reluctance to
[50:16] be here
[50:18] you're going to have a hard time getting
[50:19] a blessing god's looking
[50:23] for the worshiper
[50:26] now people say well i raise my hands and
[50:28] i sing this that's not worship
[50:30] worship has to come from the depths of
[50:32] the heart
[50:33] the song says let the worshipper arise
[50:37] hallelujah remember that brother jason
[50:39] maybe we'll sing that at the end of the
[50:40] service
[50:41] let the worshipers arise not not the not
[50:44] the angry not the grudging not the
[50:45] unwilling but
[50:46] the worshiper
[50:54] and this is the offering which he shall
[50:56] take of them
[50:58] gold and silver and brass and blue
[51:02] and purple and scarlet and fine linen
[51:04] and goat's hair
[51:06] and rams skins dyed red and oh my
[51:10] some of us won't want to give this one
[51:11] up
[51:14] badger skins and em wood
[51:18] oil for the light spices for the
[51:20] anointing oil
[51:21] and for sweet incense onks stones
[51:25] stones to be set in the ephod and in the
[51:28] breastplate
[51:29] and let them see this was
[51:33] not a priestly effort
[51:37] it was a people effort it was a
[51:39] congregation effort
[51:41] a bride of christ effort and let them
[51:46] make me a sanctuary that i may dwell
[51:50] among them heavenly father we just ask
[51:53] you lord come down the service today
[51:56] lord just the little hesitancy there is
[51:59] we ask in the name of jesus christ you
[52:01] break it this morning let liberty flow
[52:04] lord for those who are free
[52:06] are free indeed and lord we set here
[52:08] this morning
[52:09] a free people now lord we ask for your
[52:12] moving among
[52:13] the saints the spirit of god to anoint
[52:16] us today
[52:17] lord that we might speak freely lord
[52:19] according to thy word
[52:20] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[52:23] be seated
[52:28] now we won't go into the entirety of it
[52:31] because there's a lot of do this and do
[52:34] that and
[52:34] locate it this way and let it face this
[52:37] way and let it face that way
[52:39] but we are seeing here my brother and
[52:41] sister uh in the book of exodus god's
[52:43] directions for the building of the
[52:45] tabernacle
[52:46] and just as we can look into the
[52:49] scripture
[52:49] and see the directions for the building
[52:51] of the physical tabernacle
[52:53] in the wilderness my brother and sister
[52:55] we can look through the word of god
[52:57] today
[52:58] and see the very exacting direct
[53:01] directions for the building of this
[53:03] tabernacle the dwelling place of god
[53:06] in the day that we live in and so we
[53:08] have the directions in the word of
[53:10] how to go about this god didn't have
[53:13] some haphazard he didn't say you know
[53:15] uh if you can't get a hold of this then
[53:18] just go ahead and scrounge around till
[53:20] you find something
[53:21] god had very exacting directions and we
[53:24] assume
[53:25] sometimes right assuming it's not a not
[53:27] a great thing because
[53:29] we assume sometimes that god just made
[53:31] all of these ingredients
[53:33] for building the tabernacle convenient
[53:35] for them
[53:36] like they said well i'll take care of
[53:38] collecting all of the stones here
[53:40] because why there's already this massive
[53:42] pile and all i have to do is walk over
[53:45] and collect out of them
[53:46] in many cases my brother and sister it
[53:48] took effort and it took
[53:50] time to bring about what it took to
[53:52] build a tabernacle
[53:54] because you know the haphazard building
[53:56] of something never yields the results
[53:58] uh you know there's a story about the
[54:00] man who was the uh
[54:02] the carpenter's foreman right and how
[54:04] that he had built many fine homes and
[54:07] he done all those things and and there's
[54:10] uh one last home before the gentleman
[54:12] the builder was retiring and the foreman
[54:15] uh
[54:15] you know the story don't you and he's
[54:17] burnt out and he says you know i'm just
[54:20] gonna do
[54:20] and and so he goes and instead of
[54:24] getting the faucets that he was told to
[54:27] get
[54:27] you know the gold faucets he gets just a
[54:30] gold-plated faucet and
[54:31] he gets this and he gets that and the
[54:33] draperies instead of being of the finest
[54:35] that it was uh
[54:36] required in the plans he gets a
[54:38] substitute and
[54:39] when it gets all done he what he was
[54:42] doing was
[54:42] he was realizing i have no retirement i
[54:44] have no house on my own
[54:46] and it's all coming to an end and and so
[54:48] i'm going to
[54:49] take this money i've been commissioned
[54:51] and i'm going to take this money to
[54:53] to take it into my own retirement but
[54:55] yet when it's
[54:56] all done the builder the master builder
[54:59] hands him the keys to the house and so
[55:02] what he now has my brother and sister
[55:04] instead of something he can live in
[55:06] proud of his own craftsmanship
[55:08] and his own leadership he's living in a
[55:10] house that's shoddy
[55:13] and every time i can assure you that he
[55:15] pocketed
[55:17] he put back into that house trying to
[55:20] make up for its deficiency when this
[55:22] quit
[55:22] and that quit and that fell apart and so
[55:24] god's not looking for someone just to
[55:26] build
[55:26] a gaudy house he's not looking for us
[55:29] you go through the message i
[55:30] in my studies here several quotes i'll
[55:33] get sidetracked into them
[55:34] where brother branham's talking about
[55:36] giving our best giving our best giving
[55:38] our best
[55:39] he never talks about do what's
[55:40] convenient or what's easy he talks about
[55:43] doing our best giving our best and you
[55:46] say but giving my best is
[55:48] not convenient in my life i'm very busy
[55:50] my
[55:51] job this that and the other keeps me my
[55:53] brother and sister he didn't say it
[55:55] would be easy he said if you would do it
[55:57] then he would bless you
[56:06] i brought this up the other day but as i
[56:08] was studying
[56:10] i felt to put this to the page and
[56:14] the word of god and the message of the
[56:15] hour shows us how we should behave in
[56:17] church
[56:18] prophet of god puts it this way we
[56:20] should never frolic
[56:23] we should never have conversation that
[56:26] has no meaning no reason no purpose
[56:30] we need to remember that this sanctuary
[56:33] is god's sanctuary it's not our
[56:36] sanctuary it's not just
[56:37] a room in a building but it's god's
[56:42] tabernacle
[56:45] and yet you know while we be concerned
[56:48] about this tabernacle here and
[56:50] our behavior and what we do uh
[56:54] you know the prophet says you know
[56:58] you need to talk to someone you want to
[57:00] visit with them
[57:02] go out from here go to the foyer go to
[57:05] someone's home
[57:07] whatever that we would honor this
[57:10] tabernacle
[57:11] not to just have frivolous conversation
[57:15] amen but the prophet steps right into
[57:18] another realm and says you know
[57:20] that the tabernacle that god is most
[57:23] concerned with
[57:25] is this one
[57:28] so if we can give honor to god in this
[57:31] tabernacle
[57:32] a building that we've dedicated to god
[57:34] god gave us this building saints
[57:36] you know this story when it was all said
[57:39] and done more than
[57:40] 20 groups here in this city were asking
[57:43] the realtor if they
[57:45] don't buy that if they can't buy that
[57:47] call
[57:48] us first one pastor called him every
[57:52] morning promptly at nine o'clock i
[57:55] believe it was nine or ten o'clock
[57:57] every single morning have they backed
[57:59] out yet
[58:00] now you know what he was praying for
[58:06] he was praying that we started counting
[58:08] up our pennies and found out we didn't
[58:09] have near enough
[58:13] i stand here today and say i know god
[58:15] gave us
[58:16] this building
[58:27] for god desired amen saints list
[58:30] we know what we prayed for i know that
[58:33] sister jerry and i
[58:34] scoured this city physically and online
[58:38] in to end almost every single day
[58:41] in one form or another we were scouring
[58:43] this city
[58:45] looking for a place everything you guys
[58:46] would look at me and go you're crazy
[58:49] looked at everything from
[58:51] warehouses that still had piles of scrap
[58:54] metal stacked outside of them
[58:57] to buildings that were beyond our
[58:59] thoughts and i talked to them and said
[59:01] you know you should discount this to us
[59:03] and they said we probably would but just
[59:05] yesterday somebody made an offer
[59:07] and we're sure it's more than what your
[59:09] offer would be
[59:13] but when the right season comes
[59:18] want to know a little history of this
[59:19] the very house that we purchased
[59:22] over off the boulevard believing we were
[59:24] going to build a church there i was
[59:25] convinced we're building a church here
[59:27] god gave us his property
[59:28] we made such a lowball offer for that
[59:30] property i thought there's no way on
[59:32] earth they'll accept it but they
[59:34] accepted it but you see there's a side
[59:36] story you don't know and that is that
[59:37] brother ivan and sister olga
[59:39] and his family were looking to buy the
[59:41] same property but when i expressed
[59:42] interest they stepped away
[59:47] i kinda in a way regret that brother
[59:49] ivan would be living right over here and
[59:50] sit away off
[59:52] over there far far beyond the horizon
[59:59] but when god says i'm going to give you
[1:00:00] something see we didn't see the plan
[1:00:02] saints we could not see that and god
[1:00:06] says but i've got a tabernacle for you
[1:00:09] and we in our humanness
[1:00:13] don't see the plan of god what he has
[1:00:16] for us we
[1:00:17] we're caught up in the here and the now
[1:00:19] in my circumstance
[1:00:20] and this is my reasons why and god says
[1:00:23] i want you to catch a greater vision
[1:00:25] to look at the tabernacle that i have
[1:00:27] for you
[1:00:29] a tabernacle that will be filled with
[1:00:31] something more precious than stones in
[1:00:33] gold and silver and brass
[1:00:35] it'll be filled with my very life my
[1:00:37] very presence it'll be filled with me
[1:00:40] hallelujah and that's what god's
[1:00:41] desiring today
[1:00:43] and he's comes and expresses that amen
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:48] he's desiring to see a building
[1:00:52] literal that he can dwell in
[1:00:55] but he's looking more so saints and and
[1:00:57] you're with me i know this
[1:00:59] and looking more so for a building not
[1:01:01] made with hands
[1:01:03] that he can dwell in looking for that
[1:01:07] place that he can claim as his own
[1:01:09] he doesn't want to come and be my
[1:01:11] brother and sister the co-renter
[1:01:15] a cohabitor i just seen a little ad
[1:01:20] man has leased i i like i like people's
[1:01:22] optimism in this day
[1:01:23] hopefully it's not misplaced for this
[1:01:25] man he just leased right here in the
[1:01:27] city of nampa a luxury apartment
[1:01:30] that he can't afford the rent on and now
[1:01:32] he's searching for someone
[1:01:35] of the right character and morals that
[1:01:37] would rent the other room
[1:01:39] so that he can live in this community
[1:01:41] that he wants to live in
[1:01:44] well i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:01:45] there's a community i want to live in
[1:01:48] hallelujah i don't have to pay the rent
[1:01:50] i just have to pay a price like
[1:01:52] my lord jesus the price is i give this
[1:01:54] tabernacle to him
[1:01:56] it's no longer my tabernacle i don't
[1:01:58] have to take care of the upkeep
[1:02:00] you say yes you do brother paul you need
[1:02:02] to pray and read your bible my brother
[1:02:04] and sister
[1:02:04] there's people out here whose lives are
[1:02:06] a wreck pray and read their bible
[1:02:09] so when you think that just praying and
[1:02:11] reading your bible fulfills what brother
[1:02:13] branham said
[1:02:14] to make you a christian you're wrong
[1:02:16] because there's people praying and
[1:02:17] reading their bible and they're being
[1:02:19] served divorce papers or bankruptcy
[1:02:21] papers or whatever kind of papers not
[1:02:23] medical this and medical vat and science
[1:02:26] psychology this and that
[1:02:27] and you say so no i'm sorry my brother
[1:02:30] and sister it's not the praying and the
[1:02:31] reading of the bible
[1:02:33] it's you reaching to the throne of god
[1:02:36] it's your prayers coming up as a sweet
[1:02:39] odor before god
[1:02:41] hallelujah because it's nothing that we
[1:02:43] can do otherwise we'll have people out
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:45] that will totally ace you off of the
[1:02:47] boss because they spend
[1:02:48] endless hours of their life completely
[1:02:51] committed beyond measure
[1:02:52] amen in fact you can go right in the
[1:02:55] message and the prophet of god
[1:02:56] says that you'll find out here in the
[1:02:58] denomination there are people
[1:03:00] much more sincere than you our sincerity
[1:03:04] won't do it
[1:03:05] oh we ought to be thankful today for the
[1:03:07] plan of god
[1:03:09] be thankful that you were included in
[1:03:10] that plan hallelujah
[1:03:12] so he's desiring to see not only this
[1:03:14] natural tabernacle for him to dwell in
[1:03:16] but my brother and sister god's excited
[1:03:18] this morning i hope you're with me
[1:03:20] i hope my enthusiasm is undue place this
[1:03:23] morning
[1:03:24] to realize that god is excited to see
[1:03:27] a tabernacle to dwell in he's looking
[1:03:30] and seeing a people
[1:03:31] saying lord come and fill me come live
[1:03:34] here lord
[1:03:35] i can't afford i can't do this lord but
[1:03:38] if you would come and live with me
[1:03:41] live in me let me lord be what
[1:03:45] you want me to be hallelujah
[1:03:49] now we look my brother and sister
[1:03:55] i'll just get this off my chest no doubt
[1:03:57] some of you think what's been wrong with
[1:03:58] brother paul lately
[1:04:01] i've been battling with a complex
[1:04:05] about the size of a bus
[1:04:11] so if you're uncomfortable with what i
[1:04:13] preached this morning say amen
[1:04:15] because you know that brother paul
[1:04:18] is living what he's preaching today
[1:04:28] instead of trying to be great we ought
[1:04:30] to be trying
[1:04:33] trying to find out how little
[1:04:37] we can get does that not go contrary to
[1:04:40] human nature
[1:04:42] does that not go contrary to everything
[1:04:45] that we
[1:04:46] as humans pursue and do
[1:04:51] see then god can use this i've got
[1:04:53] several scriptures written out here that
[1:04:54] i
[1:04:55] should be i love this i'm telling i
[1:04:57] can't some people don't like brother
[1:04:59] branham's voice some people don't like
[1:05:00] what he says oh it bothers them so much
[1:05:02] i'm telling you i i relate to him i
[1:05:05] relate to him here's a man that's down
[1:05:07] here at my level he wasn't some
[1:05:09] sanhedrin counsel top of the class
[1:05:12] graduate that has the bible memorized
[1:05:14] he's a man that's there saying now i
[1:05:16] know it's a scripture and then you hear
[1:05:18] on a tape a voice in the background
[1:05:19] correct that oh yes that's right
[1:05:23] come on just a common man as it were
[1:05:26] i got scriptures written out here i
[1:05:28] should be referring to i suppose
[1:05:31] but i we i probably
[1:05:34] i think you'll see why i like this quote
[1:05:38] won't have time to do it i don't know
[1:05:41] where the time goes
[1:05:42] but we are noticed that it takes the
[1:05:45] weakest
[1:05:45] and the rejected and practically every
[1:05:48] hero
[1:05:49] god ever had on the front line was that
[1:05:52] type of person
[1:05:53] a person that was rejected a person that
[1:05:56] that thought he was insufficient a
[1:05:59] person that had no ability at
[1:06:01] all then that person's just in good
[1:06:04] shape
[1:06:05] so god can start using him
[1:06:08] and the very moment we start thinking i
[1:06:10] can't do this i can't do this i can't do
[1:06:12] this lord i'm just
[1:06:13] i just can't do this you hear a little
[1:06:16] voice
[1:06:17] wonderful wonderful
[1:06:21] you mean you're going to quit striving
[1:06:24] you're going to quit laboring you're
[1:06:27] going to quit
[1:06:28] oh this my struggle
[1:06:38] hallelujah then that person's just in
[1:06:41] good shape so god can start using him
[1:06:43] that's right
[1:06:44] it's when they feel like they can't they
[1:06:46] haven't got
[1:06:47] nothing that's when god can take a hold
[1:06:50] of them
[1:06:51] and do something with them see
[1:06:55] now saints i've been on the other end of
[1:06:57] this stick
[1:07:00] where i've had people voice to me
[1:07:02] unfortunately ministers
[1:07:05] or whatever anyway it doesn't matter
[1:07:07] what their other occupation is because
[1:07:09] their occupation didn't give them the
[1:07:11] attitude they have
[1:07:13] a spirit did you're right
[1:07:17] and these people will voice to you
[1:07:19] things like i'll have you to know
[1:07:22] i've been preaching this message for 45
[1:07:27] years
[1:07:30] i'll have you to know i still haven't
[1:07:31] attained the status
[1:07:33] of preacher yet i
[1:07:38] am a guy i don't say this boastfully but
[1:07:41] i i'm a guy
[1:07:42] i'm like lord please can you just make
[1:07:46] this service today go good well people
[1:07:48] walk out and say
[1:07:48] hey i understood him today
[1:07:52] but you see that spirit saints it don't
[1:07:56] matter who it resides on
[1:07:59] we've been following brother branham for
[1:08:02] 45 years 50 years i've been in the
[1:08:04] services i've this like that
[1:08:06] my brother and sister none of that
[1:08:07] matters none of that matters
[1:08:10] it's all where we stand with him
[1:08:14] our lord jesus it's no matter we are not
[1:08:17] going to be
[1:08:18] as it were like a union carpenter that
[1:08:20] whether you're
[1:08:21] incompetent or not you can show i belong
[1:08:23] to the union for 40 years you have to
[1:08:25] give me a job
[1:08:26] it doesn't work that way no amen
[1:08:32] that's right when they feel like they
[1:08:34] can't they haven't got nothing that's
[1:08:35] when god can take a hold of them
[1:08:38] and do something with them see but when
[1:08:40] we are thinking that we are able to do
[1:08:42] it
[1:08:43] then god can't use us because we're
[1:08:45] wanting to do it
[1:08:47] ourselves
[1:08:50] and so we're going to do this because i
[1:08:52] think this is the right way to do it
[1:08:54] i we use those verbage right we use
[1:08:56] those words i think we should do this
[1:08:58] but it's not about the verbiage of the
[1:09:00] words that we use
[1:09:02] it's about the heart that's behind it
[1:09:04] because if you're prayed through
[1:09:06] and absolutely confirmed that you know
[1:09:08] this is what god wants you to do
[1:09:10] you can say i feel led to do this and
[1:09:13] you're not speaking of you
[1:09:16] now let's go right back right here my
[1:09:18] brother and sister
[1:09:20] and and uh just look at this i don't
[1:09:22] want to get sidetracked today there's so
[1:09:24] much to sidetrack me it's just
[1:09:25] uh it's just unreal um i'm going to
[1:09:28] blame it on brother branham because if
[1:09:30] he had
[1:09:30] been stingy with the material he gave us
[1:09:34] if he had give us such a limited amount
[1:09:36] of things to
[1:09:37] refer to then it would be easy to say
[1:09:39] the one the only time brother brown
[1:09:41] ever said this but when you look and
[1:09:43] there's 363
[1:09:45] times you're like well i'd like to refer
[1:09:48] to every one of those
[1:09:49] and you realize i can't but i'm tempted
[1:09:52] to
[1:09:53] amen and then on the other side we get
[1:09:56] these feelings now see
[1:09:58] he's preaching a balanced message
[1:10:04] you know to be brother ivan's there's a
[1:10:05] big long level down there in the
[1:10:07] basement
[1:10:08] i thought about fetching that you know
[1:10:10] brother george puts that little level up
[1:10:12] here
[1:10:12] i thought about getting that big long
[1:10:14] level that's down there in the basement
[1:10:16] and we could make sure that we balanced
[1:10:19] hallelujah then on the other side well
[1:10:21] balances then on the other side we get
[1:10:23] these feelings
[1:10:24] and we think that we're insufficient now
[1:10:27] i don't want you to embarrass yourself
[1:10:29] but i can say this morning this is
[1:10:30] something that
[1:10:31] that i i would call it a complex
[1:10:35] but we we get to thinking we're
[1:10:36] sufficient now look what these next
[1:10:38] words are because this is where the
[1:10:40] devil steps into your insufficiency
[1:10:42] and we don't want to do it i
[1:10:45] i'm not able i can't do this i i make so
[1:10:49] many mistakes i'm a message believer i
[1:10:51] claim i'm a message believer i confess
[1:10:52] i'm a message believer
[1:10:53] but i must not be because i make way too
[1:10:55] many mistakes compared to who
[1:11:01] look at the life of saul my brother and
[1:11:03] sister
[1:11:05] the prophet of god said we'll see him
[1:11:07] one day
[1:11:09] a man but wait the man god used to
[1:11:13] replace him
[1:11:14] he's got quite a list his own self if we
[1:11:16] look at that doesn't he
[1:11:19] so god's not looking at that side of it
[1:11:21] my brother and sister
[1:11:22] it's not the battle that you are in it's
[1:11:25] how you react to that battle
[1:11:27] if you decide i'm giving up and you do
[1:11:30] give up then you're defeated it's done
[1:11:32] but if you are there now i hope you'll
[1:11:34] do this because i'm going to counter
[1:11:35] dick myself
[1:11:36] in just a few minutes in these words but
[1:11:38] you're there in the midst of the battle
[1:11:40] and you say i can't do it anymore i'm
[1:11:42] quitting
[1:11:43] you know what on the one side because
[1:11:45] god knows your heart
[1:11:46] he looks at your heart and says oh good
[1:11:48] they quit
[1:11:49] trying to do it themselves and in our
[1:11:52] mind we're talking about quitting
[1:11:54] but god's looking at it because he
[1:11:56] looked at the heart and said oh they're
[1:11:58] quitting
[1:11:58] good now i can do it
[1:12:03] but then there is the one that says i'm
[1:12:04] quitting and walks away and
[1:12:06] in a transformation like you can see
[1:12:08] they're in service one day
[1:12:09] shouting hallelujah and the next week
[1:12:11] they're naked harley in a pool in mexico
[1:12:15] there's a difference why because god
[1:12:18] looked down on the heart and he knew
[1:12:19] that's my child my child's finally
[1:12:21] reached the point to realize
[1:12:23] that he's not the one who's called to do
[1:12:26] this
[1:12:27] i called him to be the vessel i do it
[1:12:30] through
[1:12:31] the one i do it with the one i do it in
[1:12:48] we don't want to do it but then if we
[1:12:51] just listen
[1:12:52] to the call of god what's he dealing
[1:12:55] with the flesh
[1:12:57] no sir that call is down to the soul
[1:13:01] that's the call that you can't even
[1:13:03] explain why when you're discouraged that
[1:13:06] you stand up and you do it again
[1:13:08] that's the call that when you feel like
[1:13:10] you have utterly failed god
[1:13:12] you get up and say lord i am sorry and i
[1:13:16] will do better by your grace
[1:13:18] next time and people will say i don't
[1:13:20] know i think that guy's a hypocrite
[1:13:22] because it seems like he just has a lot
[1:13:23] of problems
[1:13:25] well i'll tell you what how many times
[1:13:27] does the scripture say that
[1:13:29] we should forgive one another in a day
[1:13:35] i went to valley view so somebody tell
[1:13:37] me what that math adds up to
[1:13:43] 490 times
[1:13:45] a day okay let's not get too complicated
[1:13:48] but somebody divide that by the minute
[1:13:53] or let's just settle for the hour
[1:13:57] that's too difficult let's settle for
[1:13:59] the daylight hours
[1:14:01] just divide that by 12. do you realize
[1:14:04] saints
[1:14:05] we have problems with each other come on
[1:14:07] saints that's right we have problems
[1:14:08] with each other and we get into what i
[1:14:10] call the arm crossing mode
[1:14:12] where it's like if they had just
[1:14:13] listened to me or if they would do what
[1:14:15] i want or if they saw it like this
[1:14:19] that's right let's get back to the word
[1:14:22] are we word-based church let's get back
[1:14:24] to the word
[1:14:26] i'ma
[1:14:33] lord forgive them again you'd have a
[1:14:36] hard time bearing a grudge
[1:14:38] if we would follow the word because we
[1:14:40] would spend a lot of time saying lord
[1:14:42] forgive me and lord forgive them
[1:14:44] hallelujah
[1:14:45] but you know what we like to what we
[1:14:47] like to do is we like to be what i would
[1:14:49] call forgiveness or
[1:14:50] mercy hoarders
[1:14:54] and we'll save it for days
[1:14:58] weeks months years
[1:15:04] and think we can probably just cover it
[1:15:06] with one i forgive you
[1:15:09] after 20 years that's good the cancer
[1:15:11] didn't eat them at hu
[1:15:14] the cancer of unforgiveness ate you no
[1:15:17] one else was affected by that spirit
[1:15:19] but you well i wouldn't say that you
[1:15:22] might be affecting
[1:15:23] husband wife children parents yeah
[1:15:26] but you understood what i was meaning
[1:15:31] when we are insufficient ourselves then
[1:15:33] we are subject to yield to god's spirit
[1:15:36] and
[1:15:36] as long as we think we can do it then we
[1:15:38] can't do it
[1:15:40] that's often times the position we have
[1:15:42] a you know little be setting sins in our
[1:15:44] life
[1:15:45] lord i i don't know why i tend to
[1:15:46] exaggerate i'm not gonna exaggerate i'm
[1:15:48] not gonna exaggerate no more lord
[1:15:52] did i ever tell you about the time
[1:15:56] and we just fall right in that trap
[1:15:57] again
[1:16:01] because you ain't gonna do it you
[1:16:03] couldn't do it in the beginning you're
[1:16:06] not going to do it now
[1:16:07] why don't we just stop and say lord i'm
[1:16:10] not going to quit doing these little
[1:16:11] white petty lies unless lord you come on
[1:16:14] the scene and help me
[1:16:17] i'm powerless to stop the very nature
[1:16:20] and you can look in a family
[1:16:21] unfortunately i am thinking of a family
[1:16:27] grandpa daddy sons
[1:16:30] now they're sons that's right i always
[1:16:34] called it
[1:16:34] the big windy i ever tell you about the
[1:16:38] time i was over here
[1:16:39] this guy was like six seven ex-marine
[1:16:43] been special forces but i put my finger
[1:16:45] now this brother's about this tall
[1:16:47] i put my finger in his nose you can't
[1:16:49] reach his nose
[1:16:52] and i told him except for i'm feeling

[1:17:16] will appreciate this as a fisherman
[1:17:17] right the old deal you know where
[1:17:19] fishermen get together

[1:17:22] pig
[1:17:26] you know it's in the nature
[1:17:33] oh my let's move on
[1:17:36] but when we get to place we know we can
[1:17:38] do it then we yield ourselves to god and
[1:17:40] he does it then if it's
[1:17:44] us trying to do it we'll fail but if
[1:17:46] we'll just yield ourselves to god then
[1:17:48] god can't fail
[1:17:49] there's only one thing that god can't
[1:17:51] cannot do
[1:17:52] and that's fail he can do anything else
[1:17:54] but fail he
[1:17:55] cannot fail can i get a name in this
[1:17:57] morning amen
[1:17:59] we're speaking to the lord not to
[1:18:00] brother paul now you know saints i
[1:18:02] thought this is interesting uh
[1:18:04] brother jason uh uh you know sent out a
[1:18:07] little text this morning

[1:18:22] gonna sing this morning she says oh i
[1:18:23] don't know i'll think about it
[1:18:25] so that's to the depth of what i knew my
[1:18:27] wife was going to sing
[1:18:28] but yet she now sings today a song that
[1:18:32] is speaking of being molded
[1:18:34] and right here in my in my uh notes here
[1:18:38] we have to understand my brother and
[1:18:39] sister what god is doing
[1:18:41] he is molding the character of the
[1:18:44] architecture
[1:18:46] of the tabernacle amen
[1:18:50] if you're a little stumped by that i'll
[1:18:52] just encourage you to go look in
[1:18:53] dictionary and see what it means
[1:18:59] the style of
[1:19:02] god is molding the style
[1:19:06] of the believer that's exactly right
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:09] did you know we have a fashion god
[1:19:16] and we have a language god and we have a
[1:19:19] behavior god
[1:19:21] because all of these things are wrapped
[1:19:23] up in his nature
[1:19:25] that when we have him we have his
[1:19:28] fashion
[1:19:29] we have his name
[1:19:34] just go right down through it from head
[1:19:37] to toe
[1:19:38] finger the finger he's got it covered
[1:19:41] amen right
[1:19:43] he's all oh i need
[1:19:47] hallelujah i don't need you know
[1:19:52] anyway some of you might be wearing a
[1:19:54] shirt that's got that on there so i
[1:19:55] won't say anything
[1:19:58] but you see god's molding the character
[1:20:02] of the architecture of this tabernacle
[1:20:07] god didn't come along and said now you
[1:20:08] guys are out in the wilderness and
[1:20:09] there's not much out here what i want
[1:20:11] you to do is just throw up some little
[1:20:13] spot
[1:20:13] and i want you to throw a mercy seat in
[1:20:16] there
[1:20:17] and i want you to just whatever you can
[1:20:19] find put it together know what did you
[1:20:20] do he gave them
[1:20:21] such detailed direction and i'm telling
[1:20:23] you my brother and sister i just believe
[1:20:25] this is all my heart if i'm wrong lord
[1:20:27] correct me
[1:20:27] but i'm quite sure that not murmuring in
[1:20:29] the sense of being negative but we'll
[1:20:31] talk on merman in a minute but they'll
[1:20:32] be like going where are we going to find
[1:20:34] that
[1:20:42] where are we going to find enough badger
[1:20:44] skins
[1:20:47] and i can see brother has a revelation
[1:20:49] he's like looking around the
[1:20:51] congregation of israel
[1:20:52] i see a lot about your skin i've seen
[1:20:55] enough badger skins to build four or
[1:20:57] five of these tabernacles
[1:20:59] hallelujah i don't know
[1:21:04] let's see two four five square feet five
[1:21:07] square feet
[1:21:07] two and a half square feet three square
[1:21:10] feet three square feet
[1:21:12] i'll stop while i'm ahead
[1:21:16] oh my goodness god didn't say when you
[1:21:19] come along and you find that might be a
[1:21:21] decade from now
[1:21:22] no he said you're going to build me a
[1:21:24] place you're going to build me a
[1:21:25] tabernacle
[1:21:26] and this is what you're going to do and
[1:21:28] when you get all done we go we're going
[1:21:29] to step off away from these directions
[1:21:31] now
[1:21:32] saints and look at this but you see when
[1:21:34] it come all done
[1:21:35] god had a place and he even had a
[1:21:37] direction that the mercy seat must face
[1:21:42] we cannot face hollywood
[1:21:46] we cannot face paris
[1:21:49] we cannot face laodicea
[1:21:52] we have to face calvary we can't have
[1:21:55] one foot my brother in
[1:21:57] the world and one foot in the word and
[1:22:00] say we're balanced
[1:22:02] that's not what balanced is
[1:22:08] so as we look at this how that god had a
[1:22:11] desire to mold the character
[1:22:14] now i use those fancy words they just
[1:22:16] kind of come to me as i was studying
[1:22:18] but god's molding your character now i
[1:22:21] want to ask you my brother and sister
[1:22:22] do you feel excited
[1:22:25] when you fall on your face
[1:22:29] can someone quote me the scripture that
[1:22:32] concerns that
[1:22:36] brothers count it
[1:22:39] all joy amen
[1:22:42] what do you mean it all joy
[1:22:46] when you encounter
[1:22:49] fiery is that what it says
[1:22:53] no sir when you fall
[1:22:57] in fiery trials now you notice the
[1:23:01] scripture doesn't say anything about you
[1:23:02] getting back up
[1:23:03] in that why
[1:23:07] because god's speaking to sons and
[1:23:09] daughters of god
[1:23:10] so the standing back up is what we would
[1:23:13] call a given
[1:23:15] are you with me amen god god's like
[1:23:19] no they're not going to stay down
[1:23:22] they're going to fall down and they're
[1:23:24] going to stop and say you know what oh
[1:23:25] lord forgive me i mean
[1:23:27] oh why lord why
[1:23:30] like losing your cool
[1:23:35] let me tell you about it natural typing
[1:23:37] spiritual
[1:23:40] so in our house here recently one of
[1:23:42] these first world problems that we have
[1:23:46] just kept getting warmer and warmer
[1:23:49] and warmer and warmer and when you reach
[1:23:52] the point
[1:23:54] that you put a fan in the window on the
[1:23:56] shady side of your house
[1:23:58] and it's 98 outside and you can stand in
[1:24:00] front of that fan and say
[1:24:02] oh i feel cooler you know you're hot
[1:24:07] and they come and they recharge the
[1:24:09] system and they
[1:24:10] run a sniffer over everything and
[1:24:12] they're like oh
[1:24:13] okay and just a few short days
[1:24:17] thermostat set it's getting warmer
[1:24:19] warmer warmer
[1:24:21] well it turns out out in the unit
[1:24:23] outside
[1:24:24] when they built it they put two tubes
[1:24:26] together
[1:24:27] the vibration of the machine wore a hole
[1:24:30] but you couldn't see it
[1:24:31] and the sniffer didn't detect it
[1:24:37] but boy i tell you what i wasn't
[1:24:39] comfortable in my own
[1:24:41] house when the heat got turned up
[1:24:49] oh we were talking about you losing your
[1:24:51] cool
[1:24:56] do you know the same thing happens one
[1:24:58] of those reasons the prophet of god told
[1:25:00] you pray every day
[1:25:02] it recharges
[1:25:05] read your bible every day recharges
[1:25:09] what are you doing well we know
[1:25:12] do you know saints i've used this type
[1:25:13] many times through the years
[1:25:15] i believe it's valid the holy ghost is
[1:25:18] like gas to a believer
[1:25:21] you're living in laodicea you're facing
[1:25:23] every challenge the devil's got
[1:25:25] but did you know that it slowly goes
[1:25:27] away the longer you
[1:25:29] are from the last time you recharged
[1:25:34] the easier it is for you to lose
[1:25:38] your cool do you get it
[1:25:42] or should i be a little more blunt
[1:25:45] who wants blood
[1:25:48] nobody okay we'll just move on then
[1:25:53] but you see that's why you've got to
[1:25:54] recharge my brother and sister because
[1:25:56] otherwise we'll find ourselves losing
[1:25:57] our cool over this
[1:25:59] and over that and over little
[1:26:00] circumstances that don't even matter
[1:26:02] oh hey brother paul are you listening
[1:26:06] yes i am okay good
[1:26:10] you see what happens my brother and
[1:26:11] sister we weren't designed
[1:26:13] to deal with that we weren't designed to
[1:26:15] be caught in that
[1:26:16] we were designed to let off the pressure
[1:26:19] give it to god
[1:26:20] let god do it and when the world starts
[1:26:21] falling apart and the pressure starts to
[1:26:23] come on you
[1:26:24] you can sit there and say well you know
[1:26:25] what i have a promise
[1:26:27] i have a promise you see because god's
[1:26:29] not a cookie cutter god
[1:26:31] and neither are you he's not just oh you
[1:26:34] know
[1:26:34] i'll just any away away
[1:26:38] let me kind of back that up that'll be
[1:26:39] misunderstood god is a cookie cutter god
[1:26:42] let me change that because he's the same
[1:26:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:26:45] he'll always be the same but we're not
[1:26:47] quickly christians right we're not oreos
[1:26:49] i love oreos as an example i heard
[1:26:51] i heard a brother one time use that he
[1:26:53] goes you know what people think that
[1:26:54] believers message believers are like
[1:26:56] oreos
[1:26:57] we got cookie we got cream we got cookie
[1:26:59] we got cookie we got cream we got cookie
[1:27:01] we got cookie we got cream we got cookie
[1:27:09] praise god we're message believers
[1:27:12] champs champ stamps
[1:27:20] now i can only preach for my position
[1:27:22] but how many of you hold your hands up
[1:27:23] and count that you've got one two
[1:27:25] three four five scabs on your hand today
[1:27:29] we're not cookie cutters because if you
[1:27:32] housewives are home and you've got five
[1:27:33] scabs on your hand you need to wash the
[1:27:35] knives separate
[1:27:43] you'll make my point god's not just
[1:27:46] gonna
[1:27:48] you go through a fiery trial someone
[1:27:50] appears being blessed beyond measure
[1:27:52] you're going through a time of a drought
[1:27:54] and somebody over here
[1:27:55] almost is like wow lord just you just
[1:27:58] pouring out your spirit on me i don't
[1:27:59] and and the church see has this dynamic
[1:28:02] and if we're not careful we'll be over
[1:28:03] here brother trevor you and i will be
[1:28:05] like going why are they rejoicing
[1:28:08] look at that oh no them guys over there
[1:28:10] look at them
[1:28:11] i mean the preacher just ripped the
[1:28:12] height off of me and they're over there
[1:28:13] going hallelujah
[1:28:15] i think they don't like us
[1:28:18] no sir they're in the midst
[1:28:22] of a monsoon you're in a drought
[1:28:26] but the season comes because
[1:28:29] in the monsoon is when it produces
[1:28:33] all the beautiful flowers in the desert
[1:28:37] you know a few years ago we were down
[1:28:39] there arizona when they just had a
[1:28:41] really rainy season
[1:28:42] i never knew there was so many flowers
[1:28:46] in the desert even the cactus was
[1:28:49] blooming
[1:28:50] and i know you guys what you guys think
[1:28:52] about sister so-and-so but you get her
[1:28:53] in the right condition and she'll bloom
[1:28:59] yes sir hallelujah
[1:29:03] look each one of us being molded to the
[1:29:06] calling in our life
[1:29:08] had somebody ask me that's a young
[1:29:10] person brother paul
[1:29:14] is it wrong for me to go to university
[1:29:16] and
[1:29:17] get a degree in engineering and then
[1:29:19] maybe go on and get a master's and a phd
[1:29:21] in
[1:29:22] engineering
[1:29:26] and i said sister
[1:29:33] do you ever plan on getting married oh
[1:29:35] brother paul with all of my heart i want
[1:29:37] to get
[1:29:38] married to this you know and she
[1:29:40] describes this guy and i'm like
[1:29:42] oh i know who he is
[1:29:47] i don't want to have three or four
[1:29:48] children or maybe five i
[1:29:51] and you're going to engineer what
[1:30:01] butter on the table food on the floor
[1:30:04] oh look at this pile of diapers
[1:30:08] you're gonna engineer what
[1:30:12] but she had a desire right she's not
[1:30:15] married right now
[1:30:16] she's an architect
[1:30:20] but whoever marries her will have
[1:30:24] a very um
[1:30:34] lovely girl
[1:30:39] it's their family it's their family i i
[1:30:42] i feel just
[1:30:43] i i need to explain that it's her family
[1:30:45] she would be there and you just have to
[1:30:47] know her brothers and
[1:30:48] her dad i humiliated her dad in church
[1:30:51] one time by
[1:30:52] coming when he was sleeping in church
[1:30:53] and stood right
[1:30:55] by the end of his pew and preached and
[1:30:57] the whole church was looking at me and
[1:30:59] here's the brother
[1:31:04] i regretted that but i couldn't take it
[1:31:05] back
[1:31:07] it's on video
[1:31:11] but this little girl is of the nature
[1:31:14] that her dad or her brothers would be
[1:31:16] doing something she'd be just like
[1:31:18] make room you're not doing it right now
[1:31:22] if she marries her
[1:31:25] shut up paul
[1:31:33] i tell you what she'll either raise
[1:31:35] children that are brow beaten
[1:31:38] or bossy as she is
[1:31:44] one each one molded for the character in
[1:31:46] their life have you ever noticed my
[1:31:47] brother and sister
[1:31:48] how god works i know many a person right
[1:31:50] now that fits in this
[1:31:51] they were raised in a family of
[1:31:53] alcoholics and never taken a drink in
[1:31:54] their life
[1:31:58] something in that relationship molded
[1:32:00] them
[1:32:01] and they said i will never be what that
[1:32:04] is my what my father is what my
[1:32:06] my mother is or what aunts and uncles or
[1:32:08] grandparents i'll never be that
[1:32:12] amen critical atmosphere
[1:32:18] produce patience and kindness
[1:32:21] ungodly upbringing produce
[1:32:24] a desire to serve god
[1:32:28] is this just something natural that
[1:32:30] happened no it isn't
[1:32:32] that was the atmosphere of god molding
[1:32:36] the architecture of the tabernacle
[1:32:39] and we say i had a terrible childhood i
[1:32:41] had this i had that
[1:32:42] i don't care what you had it was god
[1:32:45] molding you
[1:32:45] or we don't believe god's in control
[1:32:52] come on some of you need to say amen
[1:32:54] god's either in control
[1:32:57] or he's not and if he's not we're
[1:32:59] dismissed
[1:33:00] that's right
[1:33:04] we don't like it i want to repeat this
[1:33:06] to you the molding
[1:33:07] of the character of the architecture of
[1:33:10] the tabernacle
[1:33:11] if you ever i like architecture i have
[1:33:14] seen a little deal that said if you was
[1:33:16] what you wanted to be when you was a
[1:33:17] child
[1:33:18] what would that be and i would be an
[1:33:19] architect right now
[1:33:22] i loved a ruler i loved all of those
[1:33:25] things
[1:33:27] um i loved drawing i loved to do that
[1:33:29] it's all disappeared somewhere in the
[1:33:31] past i haven't done those things that
[1:33:32] passion
[1:33:33] i wouldn't say it died but it's way way
[1:33:36] behind me you don't see paul sitting
[1:33:38] down
[1:33:38] drawing things well actually you will
[1:33:41] you'll see us in our farm shop on our
[1:33:43] big metal bench going now that thing
[1:33:44] needs to have an arm right here to brace
[1:33:46] this and this needs to have this and you
[1:33:47] got to have two holes right here and you
[1:33:48] got to do this thing right here
[1:33:50] but none of that nice neat stuff that
[1:33:52] little nice block writing
[1:33:54] anybody like that little block writing
[1:33:56] isn't that cool
[1:33:58] especially when you walk a real
[1:33:59] architect that's practicing and he's
[1:34:00] there and he's just riding as fast as
[1:34:02] you can any other way and he's making
[1:34:03] all these little perfect knowledge and
[1:34:04] you're like wow how does he do that
[1:34:06] practice
[1:34:10] was i called to be an architect i guess
[1:34:12] not
[1:34:17] the molding of the architecture
[1:34:21] oh this is after
[1:34:25] early new england
[1:34:28] this is classic fair period
[1:34:32] friends this is classic
[1:34:35] this this is architecture remnants of
[1:34:39] venice
[1:34:43] you see they they're taking it
[1:34:45] connecting it
[1:34:46] to a period of time do you realize the
[1:34:49] architecture of you and i
[1:34:52] this is of the god era this is of the
[1:34:55] holy ghost-filled
[1:34:57] era being molded into that architecture
[1:35:01] that we would be a reflection that
[1:35:04] people would look and say
[1:35:06] that looks to me like
[1:35:10] jesus christ
[1:35:17] that is of the era
[1:35:21] of the overhead and angry
[1:35:26] that is the era of the
[1:35:29] uncommitted i recognize that
[1:35:31] architecture it's of the uncommitted
[1:35:35] now that's a little rude but
[1:35:38] i'm not feeling so polite these last few
[1:35:41] services as you
[1:35:42] probably recognized this sounds very hit
[1:35:46] or country
[1:35:47] but it really serves a point my dad on
[1:35:49] the farm
[1:35:50] my dad taught us several things some of
[1:35:52] them i can't discuss here just because
[1:35:54] it's just very human nature
[1:35:57] but my dad several things he taught us
[1:36:00] as kids
[1:36:01] he says son always look and see what's
[1:36:04] on the other side of the fence
[1:36:06] before you jump over
[1:36:10] ah well big deal until one day i climbed
[1:36:13] over a barbed wire fence when i was
[1:36:14] probably about seven years old
[1:36:16] and i didn't realize there was a ditch
[1:36:19] on the other side and
[1:36:20] now i hop a leg over the barbed wire
[1:36:23] fence
[1:36:24] and my foot's out there going
[1:36:27] and then i come and it snags the inside
[1:36:29] of my pants
[1:36:31] the pants i wasn't supposed to be
[1:36:33] wearing because they were my school
[1:36:35] pants
[1:36:36] and i hear it going crap
[1:36:40] and blood is running down my leg because
[1:36:42] it ripped this big old hole in my leg
[1:36:44] and all i can think of is i'm dead
[1:36:50] my daddy also told me you can straddle
[1:36:53] the fence
[1:36:56] until you come to a fence post
[1:36:59] and then it gets very uncomfortable and
[1:37:02] did you know if we saints come on saints
[1:37:04] if we're straddling any kind of offense
[1:37:07] in our life
[1:37:08] god will put the post there he's going
[1:37:10] to make you get off one side or the
[1:37:12] other
[1:37:13] he won't leave you straddling a fence
[1:37:16] hallelujah my daddy also taught me
[1:37:22] assume every electric fence is hot
[1:37:29] now look i need to hurry up go along
[1:37:31] here
[1:37:33] amen now let's
[1:37:37] see what we skip here
[1:37:45] we look real quick here
[1:37:55] well brothers it's all right no problem
[1:37:57] may the lord know something

[1:38:10] right close to this time of the year
[1:38:13] faith finds the word it's sanctuary
[1:38:16] of rest it moves right up
[1:38:19] on top that eternal rock christ jesus
[1:38:22] the word
[1:38:22] and lays down there and rests you ever
[1:38:25] wonder why you feel so mentally
[1:38:27] spiritually weary because we haven't
[1:38:29] been resting
[1:38:31] well i just feel thrashed i haven't been
[1:38:33] sleeping good at night
[1:38:35] there's another kind of rest that's much
[1:38:37] more important than natural rest
[1:38:40] let the winds howl let the storm shake
[1:38:43] she is safe ever more
[1:38:44] she rests right there on that word
[1:38:47] that's where
[1:38:48] faith genuine christian faith rests
[1:38:51] resting place is the word for it knows
[1:38:54] that god will never
[1:38:56] it knows that god will ever prove
[1:38:58] himself
[1:38:59] superior god will ever prove himself
[1:39:02] superior
[1:39:03] every one of his own
[1:39:06] over one of
[1:39:11] over every one of his enemies
[1:39:14] no matter how bad it looks how the enemy
[1:39:17] has come in
[1:39:18] and how it looked like you're defeated
[1:39:21] faith
[1:39:21] still knows amen that's right you might
[1:39:25] say something like well i i just don't
[1:39:26] know

[1:41:40] would just be a cruel and

[1:41:47] daughters of god
[1:41:48] and i just pray lord whatever it takes
[1:41:50] for them to come and finally say lord i

[1:41:59] and you get that guy you get him all
[1:42:02] there and he's
[1:42:04] got all kinds of names some of them
[1:42:06] different names so the same move
[1:42:07] but you got his arm jacked up behind his
[1:42:09] ear you've got his left leg
[1:42:12] sucked up so tight he thinks his knees
[1:42:14] popping off
[1:42:15] and the guy finally says enough
[1:42:18] and he reaches over on the mat
[1:42:22] snapped out
[1:42:27] if the half nelson won't do it for you
[1:42:29] saints i'll pray that god will put a
[1:42:30] full nelson on you with a leg wrap
[1:42:33] and put a spine twist on you
[1:42:36] well you're laying there oh god i can't
[1:42:38] go another moment i can't go into the
[1:42:40] food i can't go another
[1:42:46] but you know some praise the lord when i
[1:42:48] was in high school
[1:42:50] they had me watered up in a knot on the
[1:42:52] floor i could hear my tendons tearing
[1:42:55] but i forced my way out of it
[1:42:58] praise god they couldn't beat me
[1:43:01] that guy's in church now
[1:43:04] sits in his favorite spot and every time
[1:43:07] the holy spirit moves he's like
[1:43:09] that's right i can get myself out of
[1:43:12] anything i don't need god to do it
[1:43:21] i heard somebody say ouch
[1:43:28] be kind to me saints okay somebody smile
[1:43:32] number seven verses 88-89
[1:43:38] and all the oxen for the sacrifice of
[1:43:40] the peace offerings were 20 and four
[1:43:42] bullocks in the ram 60 and the goat 60
[1:43:44] and the lambs of the first year
[1:43:46] 60 this was the dedication of the altar
[1:43:49] after that it was anointed now we are
[1:43:53] in the time of the tabernacle and when
[1:43:55] moses had gone
[1:43:56] into the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:43:58] to speak with him
[1:44:00] then he heard the voice of one speaking
[1:44:02] to him from
[1:44:03] off the mercy seat that was upon the ark
[1:44:07] of testimony
[1:44:08] from between the two cherubims and spake
[1:44:11] unto him amen now i want you to take
[1:44:14] this i hope you grasp where i'm coming
[1:44:15] from
[1:44:16] this is the place that you and i need to
[1:44:18] be we need to be behind
[1:44:20] that veil we got to be in the presence
[1:44:23] of god
[1:44:24] and we got to be in such a condition
[1:44:26] that god would speak to us
[1:44:28] we wouldn't think it was somebody on the
[1:44:30] outside we would stop
[1:44:32] and listen to what god had to say to us
[1:44:35] lord what is it that you want come on
[1:44:37] please put your name in there
[1:44:38] what do you want me to do lord what is
[1:44:41] it
[1:44:41] and you see in this case god was dealing
[1:44:43] with moses so we go right over into the
[1:44:45] book of
[1:44:46] numbers or into the next chapter chapter
[1:44:48] 8 and
[1:44:49] and so it was there i want to make this
[1:44:51] type and then we'll just get this all
[1:44:53] wrapped up here real quick here
[1:44:54] amen look at this now numbers 8 verse 16
[1:44:58] for they were holy given unto me we
[1:45:00] preached last sunday my
[1:45:02] did you guys look at me all somber last
[1:45:04] sunday i went home with more of a
[1:45:05] complex
[1:45:06] i was like man people just sitting there
[1:45:07] looking at me like where did i come from
[1:45:09] or at least that's what i thought
[1:45:12] you might say they need to know what we
[1:45:14] thought brother paul well see that's how
[1:45:15] complex this work
[1:45:17] that's it i thought i went home
[1:45:20] i told jerry in the car well i couldn't
[1:45:22] even get an amen and she's like what are
[1:45:24] you talking about people were aiming and
[1:45:25] all over the church no they weren't
[1:45:26] yes they were no they weren't we got in
[1:45:28] a fight
[1:45:31] yes anymore no they weren't yes they
[1:45:33] were no they weren't my complex says no
[1:45:34] they weren't
[1:45:40] thank you brother tim made my point
[1:45:45] see so we see there that without the
[1:45:48] blood
[1:45:50] on the doorpost and the lentil the
[1:45:53] firstborn
[1:45:54] died there was no look you
[1:45:57] don't know who i am i'm i'm important
[1:46:00] i can trace my lineage all the way back
[1:46:03] every one of them could
[1:46:05] there was no separator in the natural
[1:46:07] saints it was whether the blood was on
[1:46:09] the doorpost
[1:46:11] now we look at this and i want to drive
[1:46:12] this point home to you uh very briefly
[1:46:15] this morning if i can lord help me so he
[1:46:17] says here
[1:46:18] uh for they were wholly given unto me
[1:46:21] from among the children of israel
[1:46:22] instead of such
[1:46:23] as open every womb even instead of the
[1:46:26] firstborn of all the children of israel
[1:46:28] have i taken them unto me for all the
[1:46:30] firstborn of the children of israel
[1:46:32] are mine both man and beast on the day
[1:46:35] that i smote
[1:46:36] every first born in the land of egypt i
[1:46:39] sanctified
[1:46:40] them for myself you see this wasn't just
[1:46:43] judgment that went through the land my
[1:46:44] brother and sister
[1:46:45] you see god knew that they would be
[1:46:47] fathers that were anointed
[1:46:49] of the spirit of god that even if maybe
[1:46:52] they hadn't been living right you got to
[1:46:53] understand the history of
[1:46:54] of israel in egypt my brother and sister
[1:46:57] they were not
[1:46:58] following the rules
[1:47:02] because that's how they viewed them
[1:47:04] rules
[1:47:06] and from one generation to the next
[1:47:09] generation
[1:47:11] brother chris did a masterful job i
[1:47:14] thought
[1:47:14] on wednesday talking traditions one
[1:47:23] generation of israel to the next
[1:47:28] come to their sons and their daughters
[1:47:31] then their son-in-laws
[1:47:32] daughter-in-laws this
[1:47:36] is the rules
[1:47:40] but when that next generation come along
[1:47:45] they presented to him
[1:47:48] this is the rules
[1:47:52] and then the next generation come along
[1:47:55] come on humor me saints they presented
[1:47:58] to him
[1:47:59] this is the rules
[1:48:03] and the next generation come along
[1:48:06] this is the rules
[1:48:16] and part two and part three and part
[1:48:19] four
[1:48:20] and five and six wait this is too hard
[1:48:23] to carry around let's just publish them
[1:48:24] in a book
[1:48:28] and then let's make everyone look like
[1:48:29] an unbeliever
[1:48:32] that doesn't endorse the book
[1:48:35] you realize the message is not exempt
[1:48:36] from that that's right
[1:48:39] brother chris was pretty funny actually
[1:48:41] i i took that as funny because that kept
[1:48:42] me from crying and saying alex
[1:48:46] but you see my brother and sister we
[1:48:48] come along it's like no if we're message
[1:48:49] believers we do this
[1:48:51] i like that brother chris we sing three
[1:48:54] songs
[1:48:56] we preach for this just this long
[1:48:58] because brother brown said
[1:49:00] and then we do this and we do that
[1:49:05] some lines on the message will say oh no
[1:49:07] we gotta anoint everyone in oil
[1:49:10] another comes along and says the word
[1:49:13] says over here
[1:49:14] that we are now christ in the flesh
[1:49:17] anointed
[1:49:18] and you don't have to oh no they'll
[1:49:22] never be healed unless you anoint them
[1:49:24] oh oh oh what about this what about that
[1:49:26] do you know sisters i like this
[1:49:28] i'm a man i can go in public like this
[1:49:30] they don't know if i'm a heathen
[1:49:33] or a saint but sisters
[1:49:38] praise the lord that sister's really got
[1:49:40] the holy ghost how do you know she's got
[1:49:41] the holy ghost
[1:49:42] her skirts all the way to the floor
[1:49:47] oh okay
[1:49:50] let me tell you about carrie not our
[1:49:54] carrie
[1:49:59] let me tell you about our carrie you
[1:50:02] tell me if you haven't those of you were
[1:50:04] here in those days
[1:50:05] haven't seen a lady come and see the
[1:50:08] washing of the water of the word
[1:50:10] and just keep watching and washing to
[1:50:13] the sister kerry we know today
[1:50:16] oh i'm telling you right there you need
[1:50:18] a testimony of what god will do our
[1:50:19] sister carrie will be a perfect
[1:50:21] testimony
[1:50:22] but let me tell you about this other
[1:50:23] carry sister jerry and i
[1:50:25] we're taking farm business management
[1:50:28] we're in the at the university we're
[1:50:30] taking these classes
[1:50:32] and there's this lady just the sweetest
[1:50:34] spirit
[1:50:35] i felt a kindred spirit with her
[1:50:37] immediately her and jerry just didn't
[1:50:39] take no time along there chatting it up
[1:50:41] sitting together
[1:50:42] doing this stuff and and carried she
[1:50:45] she always very modest
[1:50:48] she always wore these dresses that were
[1:50:51] pretty much to her ankles
[1:50:53] and she had the just long beautiful hair
[1:50:56] and she just had this countenance about
[1:50:58] her and
[1:51:00] we enjoyed her company and it would be a
[1:51:02] lunch break and
[1:51:04] we went to lunch with her one time and
[1:51:06] then another time and then another time
[1:51:08] and
[1:51:09] got comfortable and i was like gary
[1:51:13] where do you go to church
[1:51:18] i'm a hippie
[1:51:28] i don't go to church oh so much the
[1:51:32] longer addresses how much holy ghost
[1:51:35] long hair means they're a christian
[1:51:43] true story true story fortunately
[1:51:46] carrick
[1:51:47] was of the nature and she says i knew
[1:51:50] you
[1:51:51] and jerry were different and i'm good
[1:51:53] with that
[1:52:02] so we see chapter seven
[1:52:05] the voice speaking to moses we see an
[1:52:09] eight this claim that god is making
[1:52:12] that he is now back in egypt
[1:52:16] the covenant of the firstborn he's
[1:52:17] taking that smote every firstborn in the
[1:52:19] land of egypt i sanctified them for
[1:52:21] myself
[1:52:21] and i've taken the levites for all the
[1:52:23] firstborn of the children of israel this
[1:52:25] is what i was talking about how god will
[1:52:27] have something over here it was a
[1:52:28] literal firstborn
[1:52:30] at the death angel coming but god now
[1:52:32] says you know what i'm going to do
[1:52:33] because i'm going to create praise the
[1:52:36] lord
[1:52:37] i'm going to create something that goes
[1:52:39] beyond
[1:52:40] a natural birth a
[1:52:43] natural association a natural seed line
[1:52:46] and i'm going to bring this
[1:52:48] firstborn out of the natural and i'm
[1:52:50] going to place it in the spiritual
[1:52:52] and he says i take the levites now and
[1:52:54] call them my firstborn
[1:52:55] amen and then he draws them into a call
[1:52:59] for god
[1:53:00] and so then on through time in israel
[1:53:02] it's no longer as it were
[1:53:04] still the inheritance the birthright
[1:53:06] those things are still first born
[1:53:08] but that position where god judged them
[1:53:10] or claimed them was no longer
[1:53:12] connected as it were in just the first
[1:53:14] born in the natural
[1:53:16] okay let me hurry here now look my
[1:53:18] brother and sister i want you to do a
[1:53:20] side note here
[1:53:21] uh aside the very fathers that put blood
[1:53:24] over the door
[1:53:26] very fathers have put blood over the
[1:53:28] door
[1:53:30] what happens they leave out of egypt do
[1:53:32] your history we're not talking about
[1:53:33] years later decades later
[1:53:35] we're talking about a very short amount
[1:53:37] of time later
[1:53:38] some discrepancy some dispute amongst
[1:53:40] people exactly the days
[1:53:42] but we're not even talking a year
[1:53:46] and those same fathers come to the red
[1:53:48] sea these are the men
[1:53:50] who kill the lamb put the blood over the
[1:53:52] door their son stood there and said
[1:53:54] daddy
[1:53:55] neddy i can hear that death angel daddy
[1:53:58] he's like it's all right son i put the
[1:54:00] blood over the door everything's be fine
[1:54:02] just just just calm down son this is
[1:54:05] this very same daddy comes to the red
[1:54:07] sea
[1:54:12] and says moses you brought us here to
[1:54:13] die to kill us
[1:54:16] saints you see how satan can turn that
[1:54:19] they stood right there with confidence
[1:54:21] killed the lamb put the blood over the
[1:54:23] door
[1:54:24] but in a short while the circumstances
[1:54:26] are different
[1:54:27] they're standing there looking at the
[1:54:28] red sea and they're seeing pharaoh's
[1:54:30] chariots coming
[1:54:31] and they're murmuring now to moses
[1:54:34] why did you bring us out here to kill us
[1:54:38] we would that we had just stayed in
[1:54:41] egypt
[1:54:43] i was actually developing an appetite
[1:54:44] for garlic and leeks
[1:54:47] with enough salt enough pepper a little
[1:54:49] butter
[1:54:51] you can get them down
[1:54:55] see what happened
[1:54:59] just because god moved supernatural once
[1:55:02] doesn't mean that's the finished work
[1:55:05] you go back before the throne of god
[1:55:07] every single day right one filling
[1:55:11] many refillings of the holy ghost we
[1:55:14] can't just go
[1:55:15] now look i i'll step over this real
[1:55:17] quick i i got
[1:55:18] four notes here amen they saw the
[1:55:21] supernatural
[1:55:22] still murmured hey man and they got to
[1:55:25] the date of decision which was katie
[1:55:26] sparnia
[1:55:27] and it was so ingrained the murmur
[1:55:30] are you with me so ingrained the murmur
[1:55:36] that while they knew what joshua and
[1:55:38] caleb were saying was the truth
[1:55:41] what did they do
[1:55:44] fell back to their training
[1:55:51] and they murmured and the scripture says
[1:55:55] all of israel wept that day
[1:55:57] joshua caleb and their families wept
[1:55:59] because the others turned the word down
[1:56:02] those that were the men who stood in
[1:56:04] egypt and had the courage to put
[1:56:06] kill the lamb and put the blood believe
[1:56:08] that
[1:56:10] they wept because they just walked
[1:56:12] watched everything
[1:56:13] vaporize from in front of me but you
[1:56:16] know here
[1:56:17] i i just have to touch on this real
[1:56:19] quick you see my brother and sister
[1:56:22] grace tabernacle listen to me listen
[1:56:26] well
[1:56:34] when they had to show down out in the
[1:56:35] desert
[1:56:40] that whole crowd come and they told
[1:56:41] moses you take too much upon yourself
[1:56:47] you we're spiritual just as spiritual as
[1:56:50] you are
[1:56:52] you recognize where that spirit come
[1:56:55] because let's go behind the tent door
[1:56:57] okay can we do that they're all in there
[1:56:58] now having their little deal we're going
[1:57:00] to unzip the tent in order to step in
[1:57:01] we're going to slide along the
[1:57:02] upholstery here nobody's going to see us
[1:57:04] and they're in there
[1:57:05] well they did this and i didn't agree
[1:57:07] they did that and they shouldn't have
[1:57:08] they should ask us
[1:57:09] what about this over here no i tell you
[1:57:11] i would never allow that to happen if i
[1:57:12] had no
[1:57:13] i would do this once zip the tenant
[1:57:16] what were they doing instead of coming
[1:57:18] to moses and saying moses
[1:57:22] why are you doing what you're doing
[1:57:26] moses could have come and said well guys
[1:57:29] don't look at me
[1:57:30] it's not my fault let's go right back
[1:57:32] here let's thumb back through our book
[1:57:36] going back in time and god said i will
[1:57:39] lead you out of egypt
[1:57:41] with a mighty hand
[1:57:44] and they could have stopped and said
[1:57:46] that's right it ain't you moses
[1:57:48] okay sorry moses sorry we bothered you
[1:57:50] we were murmuring we were questioning we
[1:57:52] were faulting you
[1:57:54] and it wasn't you the whole time it was
[1:57:57] mighty hand
[1:58:00] but the training come on saint yes i
[1:58:03] have a point behind this
[1:58:07] murmuring will never fix
[1:58:10] the problem
[1:58:22] now paul here speaking of the valley or
[1:58:24] the shadow rather the law being the
[1:58:26] shadow of good things to come
[1:58:27] could never make the worshiper perfect
[1:58:30] then he goes on to show
[1:58:31] what per the perfection is now it's a
[1:58:34] strange thing
[1:58:35] that this is so much thought of people
[1:58:38] they say well
[1:58:39] i'm weak my faith is not very much
[1:58:44] i'm not a very good christian that's
[1:58:46] just what the devil wants you to say
[1:58:49] you're just talking his language then
[1:58:51] see
[1:58:52] you mustn't never say that don't never
[1:58:55] let your testimony be negative
[1:58:57] i'll lift a hand right in front of you
[1:58:58] and say god forgive me
[1:59:01] god forgive me let it be positive all
[1:59:04] the time
[1:59:05] i am safe can somebody speak that with
[1:59:08] me
[1:59:08] i am saved i have
[1:59:12] god in my heart i believe him with all
[1:59:15] my heart
[1:59:16] you believe in divine healing with all
[1:59:19] my heart
[1:59:20] let your testimony always and your
[1:59:22] thoughts everything never permit
[1:59:24] a negative thought to come in your mind
[1:59:27] if
[1:59:27] you can help it
[1:59:31] well my when it starts that don't
[1:59:34] entertain it will you say i can't help
[1:59:36] thoughts from coming
[1:59:37] well i'd be like the farmer that said he
[1:59:39] couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds
[1:59:40] from flying over his place
[1:59:42] but he could sure stop them from
[1:59:44] roosting
[1:59:46] so that that's a good thing you see you
[1:59:48] can't help the thoughts when they come
[1:59:50] but don't entertain them just pass it on
[1:59:53] no sir jesus christ
[1:59:54] is my savior all things are mined by god
[1:59:57] and i'm going to keep them
[1:59:59] i'm going to testify them and god can
[2:00:02] only bless you
[2:00:03] as you confess that he has done it for
[2:00:06] you
[2:00:07] see he's the high priest of our
[2:00:09] confession is that right hebrews 3
[2:00:11] he said he's going he that he said that
[2:00:13] he's the high priest of our confession
[2:00:16] he can only do for us as we accept it
[2:00:18] believe it
[2:00:19] amen and confess it
[2:00:22] imagine let's just use katie sparnia for
[2:00:24] just a moment what if every one of them
[2:00:26] had caught the revelation of the hour of
[2:00:28] that
[2:00:28] and they'd looked out there and here
[2:00:30] would have been the other 10 preachers
[2:00:32] and they were there coming back from the
[2:00:33] land and yes it's taken two men to carry
[2:00:36] a pole with this just
[2:00:37] big huge clusters of grapes and and and
[2:00:40] they you you notice they never denied
[2:00:41] what was in the land not a single one of
[2:00:44] them denied what was in the land
[2:00:46] they didn't say we went over there and
[2:00:47] there's nothing there it's just a desert
[2:00:50] they testified of everything god
[2:00:52] promised them
[2:00:54] that they come along and said but
[2:00:55] laodicea is greater than
[2:00:58] us it's too big of a giant to be
[2:01:01] conquered in this hour
[2:01:02] our children i've heard this out of the
[2:01:04] mouth of mothers
[2:01:05] inside what we call a message saying how
[2:01:08] can our children
[2:01:09] stand in this day it's so wicked and i
[2:01:12] said sister
[2:01:13] they'll stand they'll be young people
[2:01:15] stand because the word
[2:01:17] says so in it what i see out here
[2:01:20] it wasn't what was on the other side of
[2:01:22] that river the word
[2:01:24] said that he would claim them young and
[2:01:27] old
[2:01:28] and take them into the promise that's
[2:01:30] all we got to do
[2:01:31] don't sit here and say i don't know i
[2:01:33] got a problem with my son i got a
[2:01:35] problem with
[2:01:36] my daughter i don't know about this i
[2:01:38] don't know about that
[2:01:39] well i don't know about where your
[2:01:40] thinking is at you can stop and you can
[2:01:43] confess there are a problem or you can
[2:01:45] go on
[2:01:46] and say god fill my children with the
[2:01:48] holy ghost
[2:01:49] move upon them let me be the kind of
[2:01:51] father that kills a lamb
[2:01:53] puts the blood over the poles but also
[2:01:55] let me be the father
[2:01:56] that when it comes to crossing the river
[2:01:59] i can say son
[2:02:00] come with me the promise is on the other
[2:02:02] side
[2:02:03] it's not here and just march right in
[2:02:06] the water
[2:02:07] and be that kind of father comes down to
[2:02:09] katie's barney
[2:02:10] and some would say oh my preacher says
[2:02:13] my preacher says
[2:02:15] my preacher says i don't care what your
[2:02:17] preacher says
[2:02:18] the word says the word says
[2:02:23] and that's what we believe son daughter
[2:02:26] what the word says
[2:02:27] because if we go by experience
[2:02:31] i'm talking natural
[2:02:34] hallelujah so just left my sons and my
[2:02:38] daughters in
[2:02:39] egypt
[2:02:44] really
[2:02:46] no holy ghost-filled father ever make
[2:02:49] that kind of declaration
[2:02:52] no holy ghost father husband
[2:02:55] let's stop and say i'd probably be
[2:02:58] better off without her
[2:03:00] what you're saying is god's not in
[2:03:02] control
[2:03:05] oh hey and let me be a little spiteful
[2:03:08] if you think you can live without them
[2:03:10] maybe they can live without you
[2:03:14] ouch
[2:03:18] how many are you here today
[2:03:28] on we have a promise or not
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:34] he said he's the high priest of our
[2:03:36] confession what is it you want to
[2:03:38] confess saints
[2:03:40] oh yes sir
[2:03:44] amen let's just take a moment do a
[2:03:46] little confessing before we go sister
[2:03:47] emmy would you call musicians
[2:03:49] revelations the fifth chapter we're
[2:03:52] going to take a little confession right
[2:03:53] out of here okay is that all right so we
[2:03:55] close
[2:03:57] when you're taking the book the four
[2:03:59] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[2:04:00] fell down before the lamb
[2:04:01] having every one of them their harps
[2:04:03] golden vials full of voters
[2:04:05] which are the prayers of the saints amen
[2:04:08] hallelujah every prayer i ever prayed
[2:04:11] every prayer you ever prayed
[2:04:14] is you might say figuratively stored
[2:04:15] right there in the presence of god
[2:04:19] had a man one day tell me he says
[2:04:20] brother paul he says my wife
[2:04:22] my children it's just a wreck it's
[2:04:24] falling apart i don't think we can ever
[2:04:26] fix it
[2:04:27] he said what bothers me the most is he
[2:04:29] says my prayers have just
[2:04:32] went to the ceiling or off into he is
[2:04:35] the word ether
[2:04:36] often to the ether it made no difference
[2:04:42] you know things i know you'd probably be
[2:04:44] shocked to think i could
[2:04:46] be a point in time that i didn't have
[2:04:48] something to say
[2:04:52] i was stunned speechless
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:57] and i asked you listen brother look me
[2:04:59] in the face you really believe that
[2:05:01] he wouldn't look me in the face you know
[2:05:04] why it's down in his heart they're still
[2:05:08] a faintest flicker
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:11] but you know what it happened and this
[2:05:13] affects you and me oh
[2:05:15] he'd been speaking the negative so long
[2:05:18] he was watching it come to pass
[2:05:21] before his eyes he was not seeing god
[2:05:24] come down and change the situation
[2:05:26] because he wasn't speaking of god
[2:05:28] changing the situation
[2:05:30] he was speaking of what was wrong
[2:05:33] and the counterproductive thing for the
[2:05:35] day and how that it was just
[2:05:37] disintegrating around
[2:05:38] he was speaking the words of destruction
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:46] he looked at me and he says you really
[2:05:47] believe that and i said i sure do
[2:05:49] believe it because i practice it
[2:05:52] both ways i have practiced it
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:00] both
[2:06:02] hard saints to watch a grown man that's
[2:06:05] been around the message for most of his
[2:06:07] life
[2:06:08] break down and weep but that's what he
[2:06:12] needed to do
[2:06:14] because he'd been saying i don't
[2:06:15] understand why my family is not healthy
[2:06:17] here
[2:06:17] take a little more step tonight i don't
[2:06:20] understand why i don't feel like the
[2:06:21] lord loves me
[2:06:22] i'll take a little more stupid night i
[2:06:24] don't feel like this
[2:06:25] a little more strict time something
[2:06:27] wrong with our church a little more
[2:06:28] stupid night
[2:06:30] then pretty soon he's like what's wrong
[2:06:33] everything's falling apart
[2:06:34] everything's dying well what have you
[2:06:36] been feeding
[2:06:38] remember the little story about the dogs
[2:06:40] amen black dog white dog come on
[2:06:42] whichever one you feed the most
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:46] come on what are we doing saints now you
[2:06:48] might think this is counterproductive
[2:06:50] you say brother paul where
[2:06:51] are you coming from but i'm telling you
[2:06:52] i'm laying the foundation
[2:06:54] for the mercy seat amen god's in control
[2:06:58] saints he knows exactly what it is now
[2:07:01] look let's just close with this and
[2:07:02] we'll go into
[2:07:03] first peter here's a confession
[2:07:07] worth confessing is it not now the e
[2:07:11] in here is you right and you is a
[2:07:14] sheep and we have lambs in our midst
[2:07:20] so what we got to do is approach this
[2:07:21] from a family approach here
[2:07:24] not just me not just you we're not
[2:07:26] separated
[2:07:28] i am my family my family is me and you
[2:07:30] are my family
[2:07:31] whether you like it or not
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:35] the g or a chosen generation i'm going
[2:07:37] to say amen to that this morning
[2:07:40] i am a chosen generation because the
[2:07:43] word i i cut my other portion short
[2:07:46] my brother and sister they were those
[2:07:47] men that they were there they
[2:07:49] failed they failed they didn't go over
[2:07:52] they died in the wilderness
[2:07:54] but god had used them
[2:07:58] in such a fashion that their children
[2:08:02] which would have included the firstborn
[2:08:07] the firstborn that might have looked out
[2:08:09] the window and said daddy i'm scared
[2:08:12] i see the death angel daddy and that
[2:08:15] daddy god used him enough
[2:08:17] to lay a foundation and say son don't
[2:08:19] worry
[2:08:20] the blood is over the door you're gonna
[2:08:23] be all right
[2:08:24] this is now that young man who is
[2:08:27] standing there and when judgment is
[2:08:29] spoke over israel
[2:08:33] they realize i'm under the age
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:38] come on saints i don't care what the
[2:08:41] devil would speak to you or how he goes
[2:08:42] about it
[2:08:43] but it had to hurt when judgment was
[2:08:46] proclaimed over israel
[2:08:48] and you realize i'm not going in the
[2:08:50] promised land i'm dying in this
[2:08:52] wilderness
[2:08:53] oh god help me i wanted to see the land
[2:08:56] but you see what it is is satan muddied
[2:08:59] it all up
[2:09:00] all we could see was the here and the
[2:09:02] now
[2:09:04] just a little spark of inspiration and
[2:09:07] they could have raised a voice and said
[2:09:10] amen joshua i don't know how
[2:09:14] i have no clue and i don't feel like i
[2:09:16] could do it but joshua i believe you
[2:09:19] they'd be in scripture today walking in
[2:09:21] the land but i'm telling you satan so
[2:09:23] got them
[2:09:24] to where ah i've got mortgage and i've
[2:09:26] got a car payment and i've got this and
[2:09:27] i've got that and i've got to do this
[2:09:29] and i've got to do that
[2:09:30] i don't have time to be a priest in my
[2:09:32] home
[2:09:38] and then come to that place and stand
[2:09:40] there and realize judgment's just been
[2:09:42] spoke over me
[2:09:44] i'm dying in this wilderness
[2:09:48] imagine his firstborn son
[2:09:51] saying oh god i saw the supernatural
[2:09:55] when that death angel passed
[2:09:57] by our house
[2:10:00] you chose me lord you chose
[2:10:04] me to go into the land you chose me lord
[2:10:08] this
[2:10:08] is not an accident but their hearts must
[2:10:12] have ached
[2:10:13] to watch a once strong father
[2:10:17] a one strong mother walking in the
[2:10:19] wilderness
[2:10:21] getting weaker and more frail and bent
[2:10:24] over
[2:10:25] until one day maybe daddy who had been
[2:10:28] so strong
[2:10:31] says i'm tired i'm just gonna lay down
[2:10:34] for a while
[2:10:35] to never rise again
[2:10:40] find me scripture that says the children
[2:10:43] decided to lay down and die with dad in
[2:10:45] the wilderness
[2:10:47] no because revelation had struck their
[2:10:49] heart
[2:10:50] and what had happened in the past
[2:10:53] everything that happened in their life
[2:10:54] brought them to the place to say this
[2:10:56] promise is real this is true i'll stand
[2:10:58] on this i'll follow
[2:10:59] god didn't put them children saints he
[2:11:01] didn't put them
[2:11:02] children there to see the supernatural
[2:11:05] so that they could be filled with fear
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:08] you know i almost included it this
[2:11:10] morning but i knew i'd be long like i am
[2:11:12] now i'm meant to be out by now
[2:11:15] brother branham says but one of the
[2:11:19] things that i see amongst christians
[2:11:22] is fear
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:29] wonder if anything's changed 50 60 70
[2:11:32] years
[2:11:33] [Music]
[2:11:36] oh hallelujah
[2:11:44] but your chosen generation a royal
[2:11:47] priesthood
[2:11:48] a holy nation a peculiar people
[2:11:52] that you should show forth the praises
[2:11:54] of him
[2:11:55] who hath called you out of darkness into
[2:11:58] his marvelous life
[2:12:00] my brother and sister there it is right
[2:12:02] there the foundation's been laid
[2:12:04] for the mercy seat prophet of god said
[2:12:08] it'll only be god's grace and mercy that
[2:12:10] we would make
[2:12:11] the rapture and stand before the throne
[2:12:14] only his mercy sings we'll go on into
[2:12:17] this
[2:12:17] i pray the lord helps me to be more
[2:12:19] concise than i was even today
[2:12:21] we go on and to look at this and and you
[2:12:23] can look at the quotes you can look
[2:12:24] these things up brother branham doesn't
[2:12:26] speak it a whole bunch but
[2:12:27] to me i believe the foundation's there
[2:12:29] to make it an overwhelming proclamation
[2:12:31] the prophet of god says the mercy seat
[2:12:35] i'm phrasing this the mercy seat in our
[2:12:38] day
[2:12:39] is in the heart of the believer
[2:12:44] the world's worried about oh if god
[2:12:46] comes off his throne and would be in our
