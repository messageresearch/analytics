and ever more amen amen so we ask our brother Paul to come this morning like to sing that little chorus 977 in his [Music] time in his [Music] time in his time let's just stand and sing it to him he makes all things beautiful in his time Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just what you say in your time in his [Music] time in his time he makes all things beautiful in his time Lord to my life to you I bring May each song I have to sing be to you a lovely thing in his time in his [Music] time in his time he makes all things beautiful in his time Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you do just watch you say in here time [Music] in his [Music] time in [Music] his he makes all things beautiful in your time Lord my life to you I song I have to sing you a lovely in his time isn't it beautiful that we can and will come to that place in our life where we're completely submitted to the Lord's will and can just say Lord Lord You Lead all follow you know that's when we realize that we actually have become one with him at that point when we're in a complete surrender that we can trust everything about our own life to be guided by him amen it's good to be here today and I certainly appreciate the words that brother Isaac spoke sister Joanne's celebration of life uh was just a lovely time a lovely atmosphere and you know I I hope this doesn't sound awkward but I want you to understand that funeral homes are just like any other public place there's all kinds of spirits and all kinds of things there and for there to be such a lovely Spirit there you brought it you're the reason Reon there was a lovely Spirit there and I say thank you to each and everyone who's able to be there uh because it's there that sometimes we have ideas when we testify we're called to testify of the Life of Christ sometimes we envision I believe most of the time we envision us standing somewhere on a corner or in a store and witnessing this but we've been called that our very life day by day would be that Witness you're different you're not the same as this world and God uses you to testify in those circumstances and oh the devil doesn't like that he'll come and he'll do everything he can do to change that but the word has been spoken do we believe that the word has been spoken it must come to pass amen so let's quit laboring to bring it to pass and just let it flow through us that our life would be the word being manifested amen I want to speak to you this morning on the bride separation and uh as we look at this I appreciate you musicians and uh brother Isaac and song Service uh it's just good I I feel blessed amen that God is just moving on our our young people and uh you notice Sister Sarah included you and the young people um that it's just good God is gracious let's turn in Revelations 18 and4 very very simple scripture that I want to build from this morning in this uh uh when we look at this scripture uh and take it in its expanded form now brother Chris the other day was sharing something out of the Amplified and it struck me as I read it out of the Amplified that um you know sometimes uh we just look at something maybe almost too narrow I used to think we don't need anything but the King James but sometimes you know when our Horizon our view is expanded just a little bit wider and it gets put right back into our language and in that particular uh case it it was quite interesting their choice of work words and their choice of words actually would really fit our life each day and so you know sometimes I think you know I just want to take Revelations 18:4 and uh just watch it be expanded Amplified in our lives amen let it let it not just be a scripture but let it be Amplified amen and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues Heavenly Father we thank you for the word today just ask Lord for your uh guiding hand that we would be able to just speak of these things Lord for the benefit of this body of Believers be with each and every one father those of the body who are not here this morning for whatever reason Lord we just send your Holy Spirit out Lord for healing touches father for those maybe at work today uh uh our sister April father uh Lord any other circumstance be may your Holy Spirit Reach Out And Touch each life we ask father for your guidance oh Father how we want out of this world father but Lord we're not going to leave this world fleeing this world but we're going to leave this world as conquerors of this world father lead us and guide us that we may be conquerors in our life as the word has declared we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated as we look at this I just want to take just one moment um to share our last weekend with you uh we had a lovely time with uh brother Chris and sister Brenda Moritz uh they hosted us there at their place and uh treated us so so well and uh we really appreciate that uh uh the church Living Word had hosted a couple's banquet and uh while we're working on our reper I think that's the right word of of things that we're doing here at Grace I I don't know maybe a a couple's banquet might be an order amen uh we want to do it maybe Living Word style not not too fussy not too too formal uh if you had been there you would have said this is wonderful it was just a good time and uh while we kind of uh uh uh I don't know I'm glad it wasn't recorded that's what I'll say I'm just glad it wasn't recorded uh but a lovely time with the Saints there to see them enjoying their time together and uh many of those couples uh have quite a history uh you know their testimony and how God brought them out and to see their lives just as we saw brother Bob sister Joanne All These Years of Living this message uh we have others that that are a testimony in another location of the very same power of God how God come and moved and then to see such a a abundance of young couples uh raising their families in the fear and admonition of the Lord it was just a wonderful time and uh so we had a good time on Sunday with them I just uh tried to speak something that might have been encouraging to them and uh it was good and thank you for your prayers and uh the church there sends their greetings to each and every one of you Amen to be a called out people uh my brother and sister is not us to be a people that is hiding somewhere separated by a physical barrier but to be a people actually called to live in plain sight and when you think about the revelation of that to be called to live this Gospel of Jesus Christ in plain sight that means you are exposed to every Spirit every attribute every criticism every bit of support but it's there that God has come and you know in days of old you know they they went and hid themselves in the mountains and the caves and and uh it was there but God has called us to be hidden vessels for him in plain sight we were called to have our life be put on display and um you know the barrier that we rely on today I I think that my brother and sister uh the word has declared to us that this would be the darkest day this would be one of the most evil days and C certainly we see all around if you just glimpse into the news just remotely you'll see that there is all kinds of things taking place today that just are are just so incredibly uh uh horrible that there's all kinds of just random acts of violence against humanity there's hate there's fear all of this there but we do not need to live a life of fear we need to live a life of the over Comer with joy in our heart because you are protected by the barrier of the Holy Ghost amen the holy ghost in your life has become the very protection that we seek now my brother and sisters certainly There Are Places on the earth that we don't want to go to we don't want to visit those places you will not find me roaming the alleys of our big cities and maybe even the alleys of Boise Idaho uh at night it just is not a good idea I remember a few years ago that um you know uh brother Gideon took sister Jerry and I to this streets of suo which is where Nelson Mandela come from we toured his house and we got a lot of looks some looks were of curiosity and some were of malice but my brother and sister today you would not dare walk the streets of suo if you are of of a different uh uh uh uh race race color Etc it's a place of violence now and it's not even violence see this is where sometimes everybody wants to focus it on racism but this is just simply violence on Humanity they don't care it's the spirit it's bubbling up the streets of Los Angeles Chicago New York all of these places there's places in Miami Florida that the police do not go at night and so we look at this and see what is coming coming to pass and this is not just in America my brother and sister but this is the spirits of the age coming forth they're breaking the prophet of God talks how these Spirits would be breaking forth from the earth and then you would see what would come to pass and so it's there that we are people living in plain sight protected by the Holy Ghost amen we are in this present world but we are not of this present world and we look and and we just read thist scripture at uh sister Joanne's funeral Romans 8 35-39 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquered Can someone say Amen to that amen how are we conquerors through him that loved us so we look so much to this human vessel here and we're caring for it we're concerned for it we do all of this and rightly so but my brother and sister this flesh is never going to be the Conqueror that we expect it to be this flesh will never be as perfect as we would long for it to be because it was never called to be the the perfect vessel the soul of mankind the soul that God said I'll come and I'll redeem it and I'll seal it oh Hallelujah he'll seal it not you and I sealing it not some action of this world or of the church to seal it but he himself by the Holy Spirit would come and seal that inner man amen and it's that inner man my brother and sister that we must look to it is not us as conquerors but it's him in US as the Conqueror amen for I'm persuaded that neither death neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come pretty well covered your life right amen beginning to end nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord now when I read this scripture my brother and sister because we're old human and we have slightly different comprehensions the way we look at things but when I look at this scripture this is an eternal promise this is not a just a hope or maybe so but an eternal promise that we can hang our lives on we we can sit here and say you know what I don't care what happens to this old vessel of Flesh I don't care what happens in the politics of our day our countries or the world I have been made and called to be a conqueror and it is the word of God that is in us that empowers us to live day by day I think my brother and sister that we could not even hardly live for a bit of time a period of time without God in us amen the devil doesn't exactly like you he looked at you and said you know what here's something that that they have that I don't like I see potential in them now the devil never gives up right so he's never going to to stop and say oh they're the bride of Christ and predestination says they'll never fall so I'll leave them alone no the the Satan is uh an optimist I almost used the word eternal optimist but he's not Eternal so he can't be an eternal optimist but he is an optimist that while he looks at your life he sees every characteristic or attribute of the bride of Christ by the word he doesn't care he's going to keep pursuing you he's going to keep bother in you and when you really should get concerned is when he quits cuz he's not going to quit until he thinks he's got you so when he quits bothering your life amen that's when we should really get concerned some people say well I want to get so close to the Lord that the devil can't bother me I tell you my brother and sister your soul will get close to the Lord but your flesh is still flesh and the devil will still torment your flesh amen and so we have to admit that Satan will use any tool he can we have to just stop and say yep there's still things this flesh is here and Satan will still use my imagination he will still use my emotion he will still use my intellect he will still use different things my brother and sister and he'll use that to his best ability amen every thought deed or action he'll use it against you when a police policeman comes and maybe even if it's mistaken but they believe you might have committed a crime H they tell you in natural words that uh everything that you say and do can and will be held against you in a court of law well you know as Sons and Daughters of God I say Amen to that amen everything that I can say and do will be held against me but God said I already judged you by the word and I won't judge you again so this cannot be held but Satan will be there in the court saying but I saw them and I heard them and I saw the action and I saw this and I saw that and God's going to say sorry the charges have been dismissed right amen they were never valid in the beginning because they had judged themsel by the word and in judging themselves I cannot judge them again now imagine God putting himself in a position to declare he will not Double Jeopardy you he will judge you by the word and when you go into the word and receive that judgment he says I can't judge you for that again thank you Lord all the more motivation to stay under the blood of Jesus Christ all the motivation to stand in the word amen and so God rich in Mercy is separating us right we just read the scripture uh uh and we see that but God in his Mercy is separating us and the great separation my brother and sister is not us from God but it's us from the spirit of leoda Amen God's moving in our lives to make the influence of leod DEA diminish day by day and as that diminishes Satan's grip on you is slipping now I tell you what he hates my brother and sister is when he looks out and I'm not going to name anybody today but when he looks out and he thought he had you thought he had me and realizes his grip is slipping or it has completely slipped amen when he thought I have that person praise God I've got them no he don't right because you see the power of God through this scripture declares to us what will separate it nothing amen nothing amen now everything that say Satan thinks he is my brother and sister we'll touch on this in a minute everything that Satan thinks he is is only because God has allowed him right so we're being separated now what is this L deia is uh the people's rights oh aren't you glad it's the age of people's rights too often this is what I was talking about earlier let our view be expanded the spirit of leoda people's rights we can preach oh age of Rights no no no but I thank God it's the age of Rights because I have the right to stand on every promise of God Amen I have the right to claim every attribute that God has given of the word in this day so I say praise God for people's rights if they want the right to live any way they want to sin and do all of that that's fine that's they're exercising their right but we as Believers are here this morning exercising our right to say I believe the word and the word is my life and the word is my hope and the word is everything that I need and I will exit this world here a conqueror amen amen because God has given you rights am now it's interesting how Satan wants to exercise his rights and he wants to limit your rights but we're not really giving him the option he can go pick it outside the building all he wants we're not going to listen to him amen so it's the age of people's rights look it's our right to be corrupted if we want to be it's our right to live in chaos now look at this I want to I want to really emphasize this chaos here my brother and sister when you get out and you rub shoulders with the world it is so interesting now I imagine everyone here at some time in their life has probably seen some kind of television show about some soap oper is kind of drama but do you realize why people feed on that is because their lives are reflection of that soap aw amen drama and we think no no no that's all made up no no no Satan's smart enough to produce something that's in their image that's right and then you see how the behavior starts to relate it's my right it's my right it's my right well good it's their life go live it in chaos if you want to but I don't like drama I don't like chaos I want to live in peace and Harmony I want to live in the presence of God I want to do that but the devil will come and he will try to create drama in our life he will do everything he can to stir you and I up amen husbands and wives and families and whatever it is he wants to put drama in there because you see the drama is the distraction that's right when there is peace and Harmony and when there's there there is where true communion and fellowship comes in but if he can keep us distracted in the drama then we'll never get beyond the drama to really get serious about the things of the Lord amen amen we have the right to live any old life that we want to live and that's good and bad you want to live in the city you can live in the city you want to live in the country you can live in the country amen you can even in this day if you wanted choose to live without electricity or running water you could choose those things my brother and sister because we have rights but we do have rights and I I want to reemphasize this we have rights to every promise of God am every promise of of God not a limitation that there would be this but that and we have rights my brother and sister to these promises no matter how strong you are amen how many times have we had thoughts go through our head if I can just get to this point I can overcome this well what if you never get to the point in yourself to overcome does that mean the promise to be an overcomer is now void no sir no sir that's where we as Sons and Daughters of God come to the point that we finally lay down and say Lord I've done all I can do I've got to give it to you now and when we give it to the Lord have you ever had that happen in your life amen pray over something and and just kind of half-hearted to approach it and then spend all your time chewing your fingernails off and and just struggling and laying awake all night and you do and then finally when it's coming almost like to a deadline almost to a time that that it's over and then you're so desperate you get down and say Lord I'm sorry that I didn't give this to you sooner but I'm giving it to you now and you wake up in the morning and find out it's solved amen that it's settled that it's no longer a problem because God never wanted it to be your problem in the beginning he stood there and said let it be my problem I'll take it just give it to me but we as humans hold on no Lord I can solve this I can overcome this that and the other I can do this Lord but the scripture says that God approaches this in such a way that no man can boast when it comes to the place that we no longer could do it in our s or we could no longer boast that I overcame and we give it to the Lord and he changes that and the only thing we can say then is the Lord was with me amen amen he's the Conqueror amen I'm just a flagbearer I'm just a laborer I'm just a foot soldier he's the Conqueror amen so it's not a promise when you're strong amen it's a promise no matter how weak we are but somehow isn't it interesting in the human element that we always equate to overcoming an issue in our life by strength when he said when you are weak that's it that's when I am strong amen Lord help us to remember that on the front end of the battle not in the desperates of the last moment of the battle but let us just remember you know how simple our life would be my brother and sister if every battle that we face like that we literally went and said Lord I know that you are the Conqueror you're the mighty one you're Jehovah you're elshad and I'm here to give this to you because you are the mighty conqueror imagine we could skip a week or two or a month or a year of fretting and chewing our nails and worrying about the problems around us are you listening Paul because when he said we're a conqueror amen it's because he knew we would come to a place that we would be the perfect ref reflection of him I want you to think how spiritual that is how deep that is that to come but the perfect reflection of him did have sacrifice and self-denial amen he learned obedience by the things he suffered and we as humans in that nature he's not looking down to make us suffer to learn that we just naturally step into into the suffering we naturally step in that sign up and say Lord just let me suffer right any of you had a prayer lately Lord I just want to suffer no that's not what God's called us to do but we will have Victory through suffering we'll have Victory because we're in His image and how he learned it my brother and sister he was using that to prove to you and I that if will just stand on the word he'll take care of it amen hallelujah amen now it's not a matter I say this in humor it's not a matter whether we suffer or not it's how long you want to suffer that might be the real question the real thing that we're determining here is how long we'll suffer before we lay it down before the Lord rights to every promise do you think we have enough time this morning to stroll Through the Bible and list every promise it take quite a long time wouldn't it and you have rights to that amen see the Prosperity Gospel evangelicals they're not all wrong you hear them roundly criticize for what they preach and how they approach the things of God but you realize they're not all wrong they've just taken it to the bar ditch on one side or the other they not remain balanced God cares about your Prosperity God cares about all of these things we're not going to go into this but we have to keep a balance are we here on this Earth to be mega no we're here on this Earth to be molded into the perfect image of Jesus Christ which translated in the new Paul English as being Mega Rich that's right when you've got Christ you're Mega Rich amen when you've got a big mansion and you've got millions in the bank you're just a heathen with a lot of money because that's not salvation that's right that's not the perfect plan of God that's not as it were the proper approach amen but God honoring Faith oh they have faith I just watched a little clip the other day I thought it was kind of interesting I kind of thought about trying it here but I I don't think it will work here but that would be that the preacher told the Deacon close the doors the offering was not enough Pass the Plate again would it work here I don't think so because you see once you get into the word and find balance you're not going to be conquered by anything God will keep you in Balance he will keep us in the word and I think that ought to be something we could actually go home and just Rejoice God's going to keep me balanced I I don't have to worry about I don't have to fret every day am I living a balanced Christian Life he proom promise to keep us lead us guide us into all truth so therefore Saints we have a promise to be balanced and every promise is mine every promise is yours that we can live in that and claim that promise it's not just about necessarily it all connects together but it's not just about salvation amen God gives us balance in every factor of our life and when we have a balance in every factor of our life then our life is not chaos our life is a life of peace peace and Harmony can we stretch our view of what being a Christian is in a world full of chaos are we the only ones that have balance no sir I can take you right out and introduce you to families that don't know one thing about the word of God they have balance but while they may raise perfect children and live in Perfect Harmony without the blood of Jesus Christ they're out of balance so balanced but so unbalanced and Satan don't mind if you are balanced but unbalanced because you can live all kinds of good lives but he still has you unbalanced now in the sermon the Rapture and then when the bride is being called out how you going to put it out it's a revelation of the manifestation of the word made true yeah what does the scripture says that there would be a secret calling away we call it the Rapture people want to be so critical about the message that God is giving they'll say there's no such word in the Bible therefore I cannot believe that but my brother and sister the secret catching away whether you call it catching away or you call it this or you call it that it's going to happen anyway whether you believe it or not whether you want the verbiage like it is or not it will come to past people say well that's not exactly the words of the Bible the Bible and your relationship to it is not about the exact words it's about the exact relationship and you can have all the perfect words and no relationship amen I could go off into a couple examples but I want to stay focused today and we're living in that day praise be to God the revelation of the mystery of himself see this is not my brother and sister about a group of churches or our church or that or that or that this is a revelation of Christ himself because the Revelation is not denomination the Revelation is not the church over there or those people down there the Revelation is you and him in a relationship and you can go to church all the days of your life and not have relationship and you could be born in a far off land in a jungle with almost no things of Modern Life and struggling to survive and have relationship it's not about whether God provides you a boat a car a plane a train or a big house this is about relationship and when that relationship's true you're a rich man or woman the mystery of himself now the Rapture is only the Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride you know isn't it amazing my brother and sister these terminologies have become so common I read a little deal the other day it's kind of remarkable I don't want to sound judgmental but it's like just come join our church and be in the bride of Christ I can find no basis in scripture that's right for joining a church and that making you the bride now pardon me for just being Paul that would be no more than me going out here and catching the first lady walking down the street and saying I give you my name what if she doesn't want that name what if she says you're a weird calls the police and then I'm calling the trustees from jail come bail me out no see that's not what makes relationship Rel relationships much deeper and most of it just like any time a young man young woman are courting we'll just see a young man you know acting goofy and we'll see a young lady maybe with just a little smile a little Behavior but the roots of the relationship I'm talking about true Godly relationship the roots of the relationship are growing every day deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper until they're so intertwined and this is what I spoke on at uh at uh living words couples banquet why did she choose you brothers sisters why did he choose you but to catch the Revelation that a real marriage ordained in the eyes of God was in the foundation of the world not just some random girl that we decided she's pretty a Son of God doesn't go for looks he goes for character a daughter of God doesn't look for a bank account or rugged or handsome or this or that she looks for character and God himself would not put that in a natural relationship if he was not putting that in a spiritual relationship where's the character of the church why did he choose you and I my brother and sister as the word says before the foundation of the world why I ask you because we would be the smartest we're not the best looking we're not biggest church certainly not but he looked down through time and says there is the character of what I want to claim as my spiritual bride amen amen what was it he's the one who put the character isn't this a this is really loaded he's the one who put the nature and the character in you that's right get this now he puts the nature and character in you then he steps back and goes oh my how beautiful she is she has my nature and my character that's how God works that's right amen and I'm just going to finish the little thought here because sister Jerry reminds me some sometimes you didn't finish that thought and uh and it's true I I stop and I'm like oh yeah I only got halfway through that maybe I could send it out in the text nobody' understand that either so but you see the very nature of a man and a woman God put that in her to desire what's in you brother amen and he put in you in her yes anyway you guys know I just now got myself confused he put it in her that you would desire it he put that in you that she would desire it and then we come along and say oh thank the Lord I found true love no you didn't find true love God LED you you into true love he he revealed true love to you and that's exactly the very nature of God that he puts it there and says I'm going to put my nature in her and she's going to be my bride because she has my nature oh I thank God otherwise I'd be single probably today this nature is only for the bride remember the Bible said in the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years this great Rapture if there's not a Rapture friends then where are we at what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be and it'll be only for the elected amen the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out what is it come out of her my people we never came out he pulled us out we never overcome he overcame amen we never now this is very technical some people would disagree we never believed he believed through US amen amen in other words there had to be a seed he placed in there that was the believer seed the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church the very Word Church means called out of as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church a church out of a church members of every denomination making up a bride bride tree it's in the tape the bride tree a bride coming out call and that's the that's that the bride tree is the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the Rapture that alone nothing but the bride elected ones for known by God from the beginning the father's spirit rual jeans am my I seen a little deal the other day it showed these two little girls uh very pretty but very distinct facial features they were twins very distinct facial features and basically it's like can you guess what their mama looked like and they were the spitting image of their mama now I'm bringing this for a point don't please don't jump off to what where's he going with this but my brother and sister you see we have to be careful about whose genes that we are looking spiritually to express naturally it's fine Mama's a beautiful lady and the daughters are beautiful girls look like Mama we all Rejoice daddy is over here saying look at my beautiful girls they look just like your mama and I'm in love with my mom and I'm in love with them that's fine but we're the church which is a reflection of the woman amen we got to be careful what we boast about that we take after that's it yes now look at this as we go on here see the coming out the bride separation of people the only separation there is my brother and sister is in a yielding to the leadership of the Holy Spirit that's the only way there's separation we say I won't smoke and I won't drink that's not separation amen you can say well I I go to church I identify as a Christian that's still not separation there comes a time that there must be a yielding there must be something it is there uh yielding to the leadership of the Holy Spirit now follow me careful here leadership following the leadership of the Holy Spirit male that's right that's right okay okay see Lucifer himself was a part of the creation of God right what did that make him female are you with me and Lucifer coming a part of the creation feminine and the church is feminine amen and the church was not called to lead herself that's right so when you see Satan feminine leading the church feminine you have an effeminate relationship and I won't use because of our young people the direct words associated with that but you know where I'm going when two women have a relationship amen so you're looking at Lucifer leading the church it is not a balanced relationship it is a relationship that is now outside of the word of God because the woman a feminite is not to lead the church uh feminine or feminine I guess I'm using the wrong word feminine but you look at that see so what happens is is this church in this day part of the restoration people say well these things uh critics would say well you guys believe this message you're just following them nan no sorry I'm following the word but God sent a man that Drew our attention to these things and we recognize this is not in order so by that uh recognition it is not following a man or otherwise we're wandering around the Wilderness because that man is gone but we're not wandering around the Wilderness we're in the word and the word's taking us through the Wilderness into the promise amen so it's there that we recognize this is now I can get complicated here and and I just want to bounce the edge of it amen when Dayan T come up they rose up they said you know what we're just as spiritual as you are Moses and we believe that you're hogging all the glory and hogging all the tithes and hogging all of this and all of that we're just as spiritual as you are but daythan and Kora were not called to lead the church so here was a feminine Spirit trying to lead a feminine spirit and it was nothing but chaos and the scripture says that the Earth opened up and consumed them I want you to look out here not judgmental we love these people but you look out here and see who's consuming them they're not consumed of the Holy Ghost they're not consumed of obeying the word they're consumed of their own Spirit their own leadership their own interpretation because you've got a feminine Spirit leading a church which is feminine it's perversion is what it is amen so what have they do they must come out of that Spirit get back to the leadership of Jesus Christ the male amen he's the husband he's the headship he's the leadership we can't lead ourselves we have to trust him to lead us and I I hope I'm not speaking this too strong I it could be much stronger I can assure you but it's there that we are not called to even lead ourselves you say but God's given me Revelation and I see the opening of the word that's fine follow your husband follow the word follow the leadership of the holy spirit amen otherwise you just get off in another ISM that's right amen and here's something I find remarkable the bride doesn't even want to lead herself that's right it's not a fuss and a fight for headship the bride doesn't even want to lead herself amen she finds comfort and peace in her relationship that's it you see I don't want our relationship with the Lord to be a soap opera that's right I don't want it to be a drama I don't want it to be chaos I want to get up in the morning and know who's in charge I want to get up in the morning and know that he already knows what I'll face that day and he's already made the way for me am that I can stand and just live with confidence and say Lord I kind of stepped out of line you reminded me that wasn't the right attitude now I don't even want to go into that but I believe we could say that we understand what it means to not have right attitudes Amen to be under wrong influences and and how that brings about things and and after that spirit's broken we look back and say how did I get there but you see all it took was one little misstep doesn't take running off way outside the word and running way over here no Satan is so on top of your life are you with me Satan so on top of your life that one little misstep you want an example go to Genesis and when Lucifer is speaking to Eve he just takes Lord out of the equation so it's no longer the Lord God he just starts saying God what was he doing depersonalizing desensitizing removing the intimacy removing the closeness of the relationship to say that's just God and God doesn't really care but my brother and sister the Lord God cares I don't care what word you put to it how you want to call it name it do whatever you want I dealt with a man that was like no it has to be this this and this when you identify God and I saidwell I'm sorry but my Bible says and they didn't care they had it fact you had to be right here to identify God that way and that's the only way God would know you but a prophet said you know God Jesus Christ the holy spirit all the same thing all the same thing amen so this wants Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost which is Christ himself that's right now I'm going to say this very blunt I hope you don't mind but I'm telling you there there's no woman who is faithful to her husband living in her vow wants another husband that's right she doesn't want another man that's in her life she's got one man god-given that's right in her life and she's happy amen is that yeah I think that's funny because we've often heard you know men can go back and say well it's scriptural Lord this woman thou Hast given me well what if we'd start repeating that when she cooked our favorite meal and made us a dessert and you know lift your eyes to heaven and say Lord this woman that thou has given me but usually we're upset when we say it yeah honey I wrecked the car Lord this woman thou Hast given me honey will have to go out to eat I burnt supper all the windows in the house are open the fire alarms are going off the fire department's called the cars is driving down the road coming beat on the door and said is everybody safe in here Lord the woman thou has given me we also preached at the couple's banquet and I was preaching to myself if we'll move from obligation in our relationship to privilege come on be with me amen we can get into all kinds of things I'm working my fingers to the bones I'm tired my back hurts my knees hurt this hurts that hurts and I'm exhausted and I'm doing all this and nobody nobody seems to care and that what that does is just starts Strife it starts chaos it starts an undermining it starts a drama but if we had stop and say Lord you bless me with a wife you bless me with Children what a privileged man that I am and Lord you bless me with the revelation of your word you bless me Lord that I can see my nature is changing oh what a blessed man that I am amen hallelujah but Satan wants to say isn't it so hard to go to church isn't it so hard to line up with the word of God just God doesn't care just move over a little bit it gets a little easier yeah you know do a little research might be a fun homework fact for you the reason that people die in quicksand is because the quicksand has a bottom on the edges it's not solid the warning is there all the time but because they're not sinking as much as they would think or would cause the alarm to go off they just keep walking until that little dry surface breaks through and then devil says gotcha and the more you fight to get out of it the deeper you go because you see we we can't get out of this on our own that's right we get out of it because the Lord comes and rescues us amen hallelujah so we get to express amen our father's jeans that's right amen so how do we come out by stepping into the word amen how does a man get out of quick sand in the natural the minute usually somewhere about his knees that he realizes he's in quick sand the first thing we must do is prostrate ourself and start going back where we know we need to be that's right but if we think that we can walk on our own study it it's a very very good spiritual analogy amen the minute you think you can walk out of that problem you'll just get your problem deeper but the minute that you will prostrate with yourself and then bow down from get away from your own ideas get away from everything and yes you're going to be muddy you're going to be slimy you're going to be scared to death but you can crawl as it is like I don't know how do you describe that a turtle I don't want to use spiders I don't like spiders but you can lay down and you can work your way out of that why on your face you can't get out of the quicksand on your back you got to be on your face and are working your way out of this and when you get on your face God comes on the scene because he said I hear your voice when you call in fact the answer is already on the way that's right amen oh hallelujah amen and who would know we'd go in the jungle and find an analogy of repentance before the Lord and restoration of our relationship amen amen step out of the flesh you know intellect I'm going to say this it sounds rough but I'm just going to say it in my time I've met quite a few intellectual Christians they're no longer Christians amen now I've seen intellectual Christians get converted to real Christians we didn't need as it were to be able to quote a 100 scriptures if God give you that kind of mind so be it God bless you that's no sign that you're lost but that's not a sign you're saved either that's right you see when God calls us out come out of her my people when he called us out he had already prepared a place for us to go in amen God never calls a man out or a family a sister whatever it be never calls them out and just leaves them in limbo that's right my brother and sister there's many people that didn't go all the way in you know it's actually scary to come in the presence of God yes it and a lot of people sensitive to that become afraid to take the next step God called them out there standing there afraid to take the next step what's there for him you know we as humans are made to go to the known you know that just look at the nature as it is how we are as humans it takes a brave man to hunt the Wilderness where he's never been before that's right it's easy to go hunt the same little spot every single time and there's a thousand analogies that go with that you see we tend to go back to our comfort zone you know what that means our comfort zone means we're not trusting God yes sir that's right because he said I called you out just trust me to take you in and we've all been called out today can we say Amen we've been called out let's trust him to take us in amen we don't have to go back to what we know what's familiar but just go and step into this promise amen now in the Easter seal oh sorry about that Brothers Easter seal as we look at this I want to today I wonder today where we are at I ask you where is this Resurrection finding us are you dare to step out you dare to take God at his word if you're ordained to life you will sure surely do it that's right can we just stop for a moment and think of that where are we have we totally stepped out and from our heart be able to say Lord I trust you that's it see because I I want to go over this I have many times in the past but I want to just go over it today when um the scripture says I will lead you and guide you into all truth is that because we believe William brandham is a prophet sent to this day that was God himself talking to you that's exactly right so some people say you're following a man well I I just hate to tell you if I'm following a man I'm not doing a very good job of it because he said I'm point pointing you to Jesus Christ and oh let me just dramatize this we're standing here having this conversation and and he says you know what um I never called you to follow me I just wanted to introduce you to Jesus Christ now let's look at it from Jesus's point of view I'm going to lead you and guide you into all truth and here is the man of the hour and we go over here and the word starts to change our life because we're reading our Bibles a little bit different than we did before we're starting to realize this is not to a bishop this is not to a priest this is not to a a fantastic man over here this is not to the denomination over there he was talking to me amen amen his word was talking to me and he stood there and looked me in the face and said I will lead you and guide you into all truth my brother and sister I mean no disrespect but I looked Suddenly at that moment wait he's the one that made this promise to me it's not a man it's not a church it's not a deal here it's not some group it's Christ himself said I will lead you and guide you and people say you're following a man I'm sorry I got handed off like a football many years ago to my Lord Jesus Christ he's my leader amen he's who I'm following he's the one I Look to I've learned that man can fail me but Jesus Christ can never fail me amen man might have good intentions but he'll still come short but my Lord Jesus I don't have to worry about how he looks at me whether it's a good day or a bad day he said I'll Lead You Lord help me just to follow amen help me to have enough confidence just to follow that's right I don't need somebody to come and say look God sent me for you to follow me and I'll lead you no sorry we've already seen that bus go it's left we are now following our lord Jesus Hallelujah what's happening my brother and sister as we get closer more and more word is coming to pass more and more things are being revealed around us more and more that we see history amen sister Sue thank you for all the gifts of the books on Israel I have been reading them right and left and you know what what started in their war of indep dependence what started through every war through their ages right down to this time right now is so perfectly lined in scripture and you want to know what it is it's never changed the battle that they're fighting right now is the same route has come in the very time of Independence in The Six Day War coming right up through 73 and right on through all of these wars it's the same exact thing this is our land and Israel standing there saying okay if this is your land give us the evidence of your temple which is built on top of our Temple and this is our city where's your cities this is our promise where's your promise don't care our Prophet had a vision I don't suggest you say this to their face they get angry but in one of these books I was read reading this man talking to one of those Muslim Scholars says where is your evidence that's it right look at the Bible even just a few days ago you might be able to find it in the news there a war going on there's still archaeological people out here digging boom boom boom look what we found yeah more evidence I want you to dig down in your life dig deep dig Beyond Today dig Beyond yesterday dig beond last week what will you find my brother and sister you'll find evidence of who you are in Jesus Christ you'll find nothing but the power of God on display from you time you were a little boy a little girl and you were different than the rest of the world everybody thought you're weird and God said you're mine Hallelujah I'd rather be his than be considered normal amen hallelujah oh are you dare take God at his word if you're ordained to life you'll sure do it if you're an eagle you can't help doing it there's something in you or you just want to serve a Creed somewhere say I'll go to church I'm just as good as you are if you hold no Birthright you'll never see it amen somebody stole an hour of my sleep last night or else I'd have enough energy to dance down off this platform and shock all of you my I've got a Birthright amen oh Hallelujah can I dance for you today I've got a Birthright amen I believe because I have a Birthright it wasn't me it wasn't my mama my daddy it was a Birthright and it passed from my father remember earlier the father's jeans the father's je it passed down to me praise God I've got a Birthright hey I don't have to take what they think or what they think anybody in the world think I've got a Birthright sir oh Hallelujah without that Birthright you'll never see it you can't see it but if you do hold the possession of this Birthright you you can't help but see it oh thank you Lord oh I hope you don't mind that I'm excited but there's days I don't think I'm worth the dirt I walk on but God comes down and reminds me I'm the one that called you I'm the one that made the way for you I'm the one that's got a place in glory for you I'm the one that did all of this I don't need you to do anything but trust me oh can't help but seeing it because it's part of you and you're part of it amen oh my amen hallelujah do we have a couple more minutes amen amen so where we at I tell you I we got Godly young people right here in our midst and we practice what we preach we practice what we live to the best of our ability amen amen and we're preparing for the coming of the Lord we're preparing to see him come in power and Majesty but whether you're preparing for today tomorrow or the Rapture my brother and sister the beauty of this you are preparing amen we're not sitting and waiting we're not just sitting on the bench saying praise God somebody will blow a horn when he's coming yeah he did but there was no time to respond we don't need a time to respond now is our time to respond now is our time to stand up and say that Birthright is mine that's right no no no no no no no you guys are unheard of I assumed I I I Googled you I Googled you you guys are just I'm sorry I I didn't realize I had asked the world I didn't realize I had asked their opinion that's it what I do realize is God told me his that's it sir that's it and that's what matters to me he said you are mine you're my beloved I called you I birthed you I have brought you to this place I've saw you in maturity and I claim you as my own amen hallelujah that's right hallelujah hallelujah amen let's just prepare for going home today tomorrow next week next year 50 years I don't care just prepare amen the Feast of the trumpets I'm closing here oh sorry I come across this quote a while back I started to share it with brother Chris and wouldn't you know the minute you want to share something you can't find it but I searched and searched and searched until it popped up and amazing if you misspell things they just don't pop up H but I tell you what happens God don't care whether you can spell amen one of the brothers up there well anyway I got to break this habit of throwing sister Jerry under the bus but we were talking about some stuff up there and I'd wrote out a deal there and and uh brother made a comment about he couldn't read my writing and sister Jerry we were joking this is all in humor she like yeah he can't spell either and and I'm going to admit it you know um if I stop and think I can spell but I've got so many places to go and so many things to do and so many thoughts to process I don't have time to remember all the rules of i before e except

servants the two servants of God in Revelation the two prophets can appear upon the scene to sound the seventh trumpet to them make known to them the Christ the seventh angel say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world not behold my Methodist my Baptist my Pentecostal but the word the Son of God the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world for no other Foundation is there

bridegroom cometh we can rise with joy imagine the difference let's look at the virgins for just a moment the wise virgin arises out of her sleepiness right they all slumbered and slept that doesn't mean their back slid right they were in a waiting time and the wise virsion rise up trims her lamp with rejoicing but the foolish started running to and fro trying to find what they knew they needed but wait the word had told them all along all along through the days weeks months and years the word had told them what they needed Lord help us Lord help us to rise in this moment and say Lord
