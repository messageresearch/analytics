[26:13] asked him
[26:14] you've taken him at his word
[26:17] now you just believe it
[26:18] [Music]
[26:21] my cousin in Montana has been on my
[26:23] heart this morning I don't know why
[26:25] I had a good talk with him
[26:28] a couple days ago and
[26:31] probably for an hour or more on the
[26:33] phone but
[26:35] he's just really been on my heart him
[26:37] and his wife this morning but
[26:39] Lord knows these requests
[26:42] when they cross that sacred desk
[26:44] this desk and they cross the throne of
[26:48] grace
[26:49] it's finished
[26:51] let's believe that why don't you stand
[26:54] with me this morning and let's just go
[26:55] to prayer
[26:57] our gracious father Lord as we stand
[27:00] humbly
[27:01] before the throne of grace this morning
[27:04] knowing Lord God these petitions these
[27:08] things that we've asked are not in vain
[27:10] you put them on our hearts
[27:13] Lord you know everything that we would
[27:15] speak that we would ask for before it
[27:17] was even spoken
[27:18] so father we turn him into your hand we
[27:21] give them to you
[27:23] and father we ask in the name of the
[27:25] Lord Jesus Christ that every need would
[27:27] be met
[27:28] every sickness that's here would be
[27:30] healed before they leave this place
[27:33] and Lord God every request Lord for
[27:35] these different ones is that our brother
[27:38] has read that's come across this desk
[27:40] Lord God you know the outcome you knew
[27:44] it before the foundation of the world
[27:46] that's the that's where we can leave it
[27:48] that's where we can take it we can just
[27:50] put it at your feet Lord knowing that
[27:52] it's finished
[27:54] give us the faith to believe if
[27:56] anybody's in our midst it's not feeling
[27:58] well
[27:59] you're healed
[28:00] by his stripes we're healed we just
[28:04] believe that Lord we claim it and I pray
[28:08] Lord God that the remaindrance of this
[28:10] service would be to your honor and Glory
[28:12] may you have preeminence
[28:15] may you speak father not the words of a
[28:18] man not the words of our brother Paul
[28:20] Lord but you speaking forth it's your
[28:23] voice that we hear and your word that's
[28:26] coming forth so we stand upon that Lord
[28:30] we believe it and we claim it and we
[28:33] take it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:35] Christ everything you have for us Lord
[28:37] and father may we not leave here the
[28:40] same
[28:41] may we be like those that come from
[28:43] Emmaus
[28:44] did not our hearts burn within us as you
[28:48] speak to us along the way it's you
[28:50] speaking father we love you Lord God I
[28:53] pray for my brother and
[28:55] and cousin in Montana right now Lord I
[28:58] don't know why he's so strong on my
[28:59] heart
[29:00] but Lord whatever it is I send forth
[29:03] your Holy Spirit to him
[29:05] that you would just touch him
[29:07] him and his wife may they receive just
[29:09] whatever you have need of whatever they
[29:12] have need of Lord from you this morning
[29:14] as they watch this service
[29:16] Lord God we love you we appreciate you
[29:19] we commit the remainders of this service
[29:21] into your hands
[29:23] and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

[37:34] can we say Amen to that this morning
[37:38] how beautiful amen just to know the
[37:41] presence of God
[37:43] having come down and just
[37:46] surround us stir our hearts
[37:51] how beautiful it is
[37:53] well sometimes you know people
[37:55] misunderstand things and I certainly
[37:57] don't want you to misunderstand anything
[38:00] this morning but
[38:03] you know
[38:05] we as Sons and Daughters of God when
[38:09] we would be in the house of God or maybe
[38:11] even wherever
[38:14] there's a lot of ways to express
[38:15] ourselves right some
[38:18] dance in the spirits
[38:21] some are
[38:22] you might say silent and don't move but
[38:25] their their spirit is
[38:27] rising up and reaching out to the Lord
[38:29] some wave a hand some clap amen and you
[38:33] say why are you saying this because I'm
[38:35] speaking to the Lord this morning
[38:38] thank you Lord for bringing our sister
[38:40] April
[38:42] home Healthy Back amongst us can we
[38:45] thank the Lord this morning
[38:50] yeah
[38:52] and
[38:55] connected you might say to
[38:57] our sister
[39:00] but she's my sister also
[39:03] in that unique about the body of Christ
[39:06] is that
[39:07] we have a family side that is
[39:10] genetic
[39:11] it is
[39:13] in the human element then we have a
[39:15] spiritual side which is genetic in a
[39:18] spiritual element
[39:20] and uh
[39:22] I just want to
[39:23] share something just so happens to be
[39:26] our sister April sister Andrea which we
[39:28] love very much as a sister in Christ and
[39:32] I won't read the whole
[39:35] uh email
[39:37] let me just
[39:39] give it to you briefly
[39:42] she's sharing this wasn't just to me it
[39:44] was to others
[39:46] she's talking about having cancer
[39:49] markers
[39:50] and these are cells in your body
[39:53] that they can tell have been touched by
[39:56] cancer
[39:57] and um
[40:00] she's sharing with us that they tested
[40:02] these levels this week
[40:04] and mine
[40:06] or half
[40:12] of what they were two months ago
[40:15] yeah we got a hand clap of praise for
[40:18] the Lord
[40:26] anyway she goes on to talk about the
[40:28] different tests and the different levels
[40:31] and um so here it is
[40:34] um one of those dropped from 60
[40:38] to 4.
[40:40] my just a slight change
[40:43] amen
[40:44] and normal is two
[40:47] so she's
[40:48] almost back to normal
[40:51] amen second markers at 36 and considered
[40:55] to be less than 32 is normal the third
[40:58] one is now 60 and it is considered to be
[41:02] normal at 38. so what we're seeing my
[41:06] brother and sister is as the prophet and
[41:09] the word of God so aptly shows us
[41:11] there is healing
[41:14] and there is miracles
[41:17] and sometimes we try to say well God's
[41:20] just healing our sister I tell you
[41:23] it's a miracle
[41:25] because some Miracles are instantaneous
[41:28] and some Miracles God just allows our
[41:31] faith to grow
[41:33] and express and grow and express and
[41:36] grow and express and I pray that you
[41:40] will be able to catch this in case I get
[41:42] distracted today but this touched me so
[41:45] much because it fits very much with what
[41:48] the Lord's laid on our heart today
[41:49] because you see my brother and sister
[41:51] sometimes people have to have something
[41:54] definitive we're humans right we need
[41:56] something definitive but then there's
[41:59] this thing that God placed in us it's a
[42:01] seed Gene of God that's been placed in
[42:04] us and it's called faith
[42:06] and as Faith grows you see we are as it
[42:10] were a vacuum
[42:13] do you understand what I'm saying
[42:16] we are not an unlimited capacity we are
[42:19] vacuum in other words there is something
[42:21] goes in something has to go out this is
[42:24] why the prophet of God shows us and
[42:26] we'll touch on that today in just a
[42:29] minute degree but you see my brother and
[42:31] sister if you have more faith than doubt
[42:34] and fear has to leave
[42:36] if you have more doubt and fear faith
[42:38] has to leave you can't say I'll just
[42:40] include them both no it don't work that
[42:43] way amen so we have this capacity and as
[42:47] God moves in our life my brother and
[42:49] sister it is I believe your prayers that
[42:53] has had an effect upon our sister but
[42:55] you see what it is is God knows what we
[42:58] need to come and affect us to open up
[43:01] and say now I let go of fear I let go of
[43:05] doubts I let go of all of these things
[43:08] and I have now Faith to displace that
[43:12] and faith has such an effect on Sons and
[43:15] Daughters of God have you ever noticed
[43:17] that when the devil hammers on you you
[43:19] might go through a little season
[43:22] but do you realize that just because you
[43:24] go through that season doesn't mean
[43:25] Faith left
[43:27] that's only Satan trying to get you to
[43:31] let go of faith
[43:34] we hold on to faith
[43:36] God says they believe
[43:39] and I believe they believe because I put
[43:41] the seed Gene of faith in them and I
[43:44] gave them ability to believe and now
[43:47] they're exercising
[43:50] oh my oh my
[43:53] I'll get all excited here Saints but
[43:56] anyway lovely lovely email and I share
[43:59] just the Crux of that that she is
[44:00] claiming confessing amen her healing and
[44:04] it is coming to pass and we see God is
[44:07] touching uh our other sisters we've been
[44:09] praying for amen so let's just stand
[44:12] upon that promise today and not let
[44:15] Satan dislodge our our faith in the word
[44:18] I want to speak to you today on the
[44:20] power of recognition
[44:22] amen and so thank you very much enjoyed
[44:25] the song service today amen the power of
[44:29] recognition my brother and sister you
[44:31] see there is a power in recognition
[44:33] there is a a uh an opening a releasing
[44:38] uh that comes and as we'll look through
[44:41] the word of God today I just trust that
[44:44] um uh what the lord has laid upon my
[44:46] heart will I will be able to express it
[44:48] correctly amen let's just stand as we go
[44:51] to the word I want to go back to what I
[44:55] took as scripture in uh last Sunday and
[44:59] I want to
[45:00] um uh take out a first Peter the fifth
[45:04] chapter verses 6 through 11. uh the lion
[45:07] roared last Sunday and he roared on
[45:10] Monday and he roared on Tuesday and he
[45:12] roared on Wednesday and Thursday and
[45:15] Friday and Saturday and now we're back
[45:18] in church again and the lion is still
[45:21] roaring
[45:22] Hallelujah but today we're going to talk
[45:24] about another lying
[45:26] another lying lion I'll get tongue-tied
[45:30] here
[45:31] we're talking about another lion today
[45:33] but I want to bring this out felt it
[45:34] very heavy on my heart from last week to
[45:37] bring this out so that we could
[45:40] understand the context of the Lion
[45:44] and
[45:46] his impersonator
[45:49] yes
[45:50] prophet of God shows us that everything
[45:52] Satan's done has been an impersonation
[45:55] and you know as well as I do the
[45:57] impersonation is not as good as the
[45:59] original
[46:00] and so we also know that if there is a
[46:04] counterfeit there has to be a real
[46:07] and um I don't know if any of you have
[46:10] ever handled counterfeit money
[46:12] well Once Upon a Time years ago I I was
[46:16] working out of town I went to the bank
[46:18] and collected a few hundred dollars to
[46:22] um uh have make sure I had plenty of
[46:24] money in this small town we were going
[46:26] to work in and
[46:28] um you know I went to pay for my meal
[46:30] one evening
[46:31] and the man took the marker
[46:34] swiped it across the bill looked up at
[46:36] me and says
[46:38] see that
[46:39] I was like okay
[46:42] that is counterfeit
[46:46] oh
[46:48] I'm thinking he's calling the police now
[46:50] I have to explain everything where did I
[46:52] get this and you know
[46:54] um
[46:56] and this was a small town in Union house
[46:58] small towns are the little restaurant
[47:00] was connected to another form of
[47:03] entertainment that small towns have and
[47:05] the man just looked at me for a minute
[47:07] and I said I got it from the bank
[47:09] and he goes no problem and he went and
[47:11] walked the doorway comes back a few
[47:13] minutes later with my change he said
[47:15] they won't know the difference
[47:21] but it's the Holy Ghost In You
[47:24] that knows the difference between the
[47:26] counterfeit
[47:28] and the real
[47:30] otherwise the counterfeit would get
[47:32] passed off on you
[47:34] and you wouldn't know the difference
[47:36] amen but have you ever notice how God
[47:38] works in our life and when things you
[47:41] know like the little chime as it were
[47:43] the little arm
[47:45] something's not quite right
[47:49] because God made us to know the
[47:51] difference oh we didn't come to know the
[47:53] different Saints he made us to know the
[47:57] difference
[47:59] okay
[48:01] first Peter the fifth chapter 6 is
[48:03] through 11. humble yourselves therefore
[48:06] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[48:09] exalt you in due time in other words the
[48:12] exalting is coming but it's going to
[48:13] come in a certain season
[48:15] casting all your care upon him for he
[48:17] careth for you be sober
[48:20] be vigilant because your adversary now
[48:24] he didn't say it was God's adversary
[48:27] but it's the word in you so that
[48:29] automatically made it God's adversary
[48:31] but you see you don't see the devil
[48:34] knocking on the door of Heaven as it
[48:36] were the throne and throwing
[48:39] condemnation
[48:40] he comes to our doorstep
[48:43] he comes to our life he comes to our
[48:45] circumstance
[48:46] there's where the real battle has come
[48:49] down
[48:49] to come is with us
[48:53] your adversary the devil
[48:57] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[48:59] whom he may devour
[49:01] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[49:04] knowing that the same afflictions are
[49:06] accomplished in your brethren that are
[49:08] in the world
[49:10] but the God of all Grace
[49:12] who hath called us unto his eternal
[49:15] glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have
[49:18] suffered a while I don't like suffering
[49:22] I don't like suffering
[49:25] let me say it again I don't like
[49:28] suffering
[49:32] but for my Lord Jesus Christ
[49:34] I will embrace all suffering
[49:41] not for Bill Gates
[49:44] not for all the rest of these rich men
[49:48] not for the influential in the city
[49:51] but for Jesus Christ yes
[49:59] oh my
[50:04] yes same afflictions are accompanied in
[50:07] your brethren that are in the world but
[50:09] the God of all Grace who hath called us
[50:11] into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[50:13] after that you have suffered a while
[50:14] make you perfect
[50:17] establish strengthen settle you now look
[50:20] I I I'll forget about this I didn't
[50:22] really make a note out of it but I'm
[50:24] going to tell you right now I believe so
[50:26] much in the plan of God I'm going to
[50:27] stand before you Saints this morning and
[50:30] tell you I'm perfect
[50:36] some will say aha we know you better
[50:38] than that that's right you know this
[50:41] flesh
[50:42] better than that but you see I get to
[50:45] believe as it were you or I get to
[50:47] believe the word and so I'm going to say
[50:50] this morning I'm perfect anybody care to
[50:52] join me
[50:53] Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm going to make
[50:57] you perfect established strength and
[50:58] settle you to him be glory and Dominion
[51:01] forever and ever amen heavenly father
[51:03] just asks you to lead us this morning
[51:05] guide us
[51:06] father for every shortcoming every
[51:08] weakness father Lord how the devil would
[51:11] like to climb in the car and go to
[51:13] church with us but Lord Jesus we come
[51:15] here today believing your word and
[51:18] acting upon your word and father and
[51:21] courage in our spirit to just come
[51:22] closer to you Lord to live what you have
[51:25] already given us father to claim it in
[51:28] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[51:31] Hallelujah you may be seated Saints
[51:34] now
[51:35] I this morning
[51:38] would Desire by God's grace my brother
[51:41] and sister just to be very concise
[51:44] so I just asked for you just to say a
[51:46] little prayer that will just help me
[51:48] move right along now verse 8 says be
[51:51] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[51:53] making it very personal the devil
[51:56] as a roaring lion now my brother and
[51:58] sister I want you to see this it does
[52:01] not say he is a roaring lion but as a
[52:05] roaring lion so it's there that we see
[52:08] almost a symbolic reference giving us a
[52:12] mental image of Satan and I think it's
[52:14] good we don't want to downplay that
[52:16] because I believe anyone that would say
[52:18] well you know the devil is no match
[52:20] that's right but if we're under the
[52:22] bloodies no match where if In the Flesh
[52:24] he's more than a match but we look at
[52:28] this and see I I use this because I
[52:30] could not in my mind come up with a a
[52:32] better word but it's like a symbolic
[52:35] reference giving us a mental image of
[52:38] Satan as a great roaring lion I shared
[52:41] with you last Sunday about the lines
[52:43] that we saw up close in Africa many
[52:45] years ago and how it's just stunning you
[52:48] know to look at their nose and it's the
[52:50] size of a dinner plate and you know just
[52:52] the sheer Rippling muscle walking the
[52:55] string that is just displayed there and
[52:58] I believe that the word of God lays this
[53:01] out was anointed to delay this out to us
[53:04] to give us that kind of a reference to
[53:07] realize that without the Holy Ghost
[53:09] Satan is a lion in our house
[53:13] and so it's there by God's grace and
[53:16] mercy amen that we see he is not a
[53:19] roaring lion he is as a roaring lion but
[53:23] we recognize that there is a force
[53:26] behind Satan and my brother and sister
[53:28] sometimes force is not from brute
[53:31] strength as it was that he deceived that
[53:34] part of the angels in heaven he did not
[53:36] do that with brute string he did that
[53:39] with cunning and deceptive nature he did
[53:41] that in subtle fashion just the same as
[53:44] he displayed through the serpent in the
[53:47] garden it was through subtility and
[53:50] there is a certain strength that is
[53:51] inceptility I uh you know sometimes in
[53:55] your studies you look at things and
[53:57] you'll find my brother and sister there
[53:59] are people that are actually gifted now
[54:02] why the Lord would allow such things to
[54:05] be I don't know but there are people who
[54:07] are actually very gifted at being
[54:10] subtlet at being able to spin the tail
[54:14] to weave the picture and if you don't
[54:16] think so my brother and sister just talk
[54:18] to some of them Rich Nigerian princes
[54:21] that have taken about half a billion
[54:23] dollars from people in the United States
[54:25] because their little greedy spirit said
[54:28] you mean I only have to give you fifty
[54:30] thousand dollars to get a million I mean
[54:32] my anyone do that right
[54:36] right
[54:38] anyone want to sign up
[54:42] tens of thousands have
[54:45] and we say what
[54:48] really
[54:50] impossible
[54:53] no because you see it really isn't so
[54:55] much the gift
[54:57] that was in that person as the spirit
[55:00] that's in them
[55:01] is connecting with the spirit of the
[55:03] person there to deceive
[55:09] if all you can think about day in and
[55:11] day out is get rich get rich get rich
[55:13] the spirit of those who also want to get
[55:17] rich
[55:18] will come to you
[55:20] only their idea of getting rich is you
[55:22] contributing
[55:26] kind of like the guy on the internet who
[55:28] says why aren't you investing in this
[55:30] and that you can make 25 or 30 percent
[55:33] money you think they would really share
[55:35] that
[55:36] if it was real
[55:39] no they would put their money and make
[55:41] the 25 or 30 percent and do it again and
[55:44] again and again and again you are the
[55:47] portion they want to get rich off of
[55:50] now when you look about this Satan
[55:54] he was there he wants to be lifted up
[55:57] we'll touch on this in a little
[55:59] different fashion in a minute he's the
[56:00] one that wants to be lifted up over the
[56:02] congregation
[56:05] to have a congregation you must have
[56:06] people
[56:10] or the currency
[56:13] I want you to realize that Saints
[56:16] it's not real estate Satan doesn't care
[56:18] about real estate although he owns a lot
[56:21] he doesn't care about all of the fine
[56:23] automobiles and all the fine clothes
[56:26] the currency
[56:28] is humanity
[56:32] That's what Satan wants to be rich in
[56:35] he wants to be worshiped you never seen
[56:38] a house worship you've never seen a car
[56:40] worship you've never seen all of these
[56:42] possessions of Life Worship it is only
[56:45] Humanity
[56:47] that can worship
[56:49] so he is
[56:51] a great force not a whimpering kitten
[56:54] but my brother and sister you realize as
[56:56] it is that he's come and the image has
[56:58] been presented the word of God lays it
[57:00] out that he is as a roaring lion walking
[57:03] about now I want to make another
[57:05] emphasis because we'll tie this in later
[57:06] he's not just there my brother and
[57:09] sister to have influence but the
[57:11] scripture says seeking whom he may
[57:14] devour so there is something that he is
[57:17] going to do a great transformation in
[57:21] people's lives because you are not
[57:23] devoured by the spirit of laodiceem
[57:25] without it having an incredible impact
[57:27] upon your life you're not devoured by a
[57:30] lust and pride in all of these kind of
[57:33] things without it having a major impact
[57:35] on your life and so Satan is here to to
[57:39] Devour the people Amen to devour what he
[57:43] can destroy and as we'll go into second
[57:46] Corinthians here in the 11th chapter
[57:49] verses 13 through 23 we may not read all
[57:52] of them but we'll just start here for
[57:56] such are false apostles
[58:00] you know the scripture if you don't
[58:02] please read it
[58:04] for such are false Apostles deceitful
[58:07] workers transforming themselves
[58:09] into the Apostles of Christ
[58:13] in other words they were not the
[58:14] apostles but they had saw an image that
[58:17] had been placed by the word and they
[58:19] could look at that image and say I can
[58:21] impersonate that I can counterfeit that
[58:24] and so then they just transform
[58:26] themselves amen so they look at that and
[58:29] say I want to be an apostle of Christ
[58:31] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[58:35] transformed into an angel of Light
[58:38] therefore it is no great thing if his
[58:41] ministers
[58:43] also transform also be transformed as
[58:46] the Ministers of righteousness whose end
[58:49] shall be according to their works I say
[58:53] again let no man think me a fool if
[58:56] otherwise yet as a fool receive me then
[58:58] I may boast myself a little now my
[59:01] brother and sister to have a minister as
[59:04] it were an apostle have someone come and
[59:07] say you know what I'm going to do a
[59:09] little boasting today uh most of us that
[59:12] would be a turn off but look at how he
[59:14] is coming now he is declaring to them
[59:17] that there are going to be these that
[59:20] are transforming themselves right not
[59:23] something else is transforming them it's
[59:25] something they did themselves that's the
[59:27] thing I love about the word of God as
[59:29] the prophet of God said you should not
[59:30] say I have the Holy Ghost it's a
[59:34] boastful attitude when you hear people
[59:36] in that context I'm not saying just the
[59:38] verbiage of everyday life that you would
[59:40] testify and say I believe I have the
[59:42] Holy Ghost we we're talking in a little
[59:44] different Nuance here it is those people
[59:46] almost defending or boasting I have the
[59:49] Holy Ghost the prophet of God says you
[59:52] should say the Holy Ghost has me amen
[59:55] that's where you're giving a complete
[59:57] surrender because as it is in the
[1:00:00] context of that one denotes I'm in
[1:00:02] control and the other denotes he's in
[1:00:04] control and so we want to always let our
[1:00:07] lord Jesus be in control amen so he's
[1:00:11] now coming he says you know what uh let
[1:00:14] no man think me a fool if otherwise yet
[1:00:17] as a fool to receive me then I may boast
[1:00:20] myself a little that which I speak I
[1:00:23] speak it not after the Lord but as it
[1:00:26] were foolishly in this confidence of
[1:00:29] boasting
[1:00:30] seeing that many glory after the flesh
[1:00:33] all glory also
[1:00:37] wow
[1:00:40] if I said that and said Paul says
[1:00:42] you guys would be like making a beeline
[1:00:45] for a door
[1:00:47] but you have to catch the point
[1:00:49] Paul is making
[1:00:53] let me put it this way to you Saints
[1:00:57] everything that the devil can boast of
[1:01:03] has already been boasted of yeah
[1:01:07] everything that the devil boasts that he
[1:01:10] can do
[1:01:11] has already been boasted
[1:01:14] of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:01:18] the poor guy is not original
[1:01:21] he's not original at all
[1:01:26] now I'm telling you my brother and
[1:01:28] sister speaking on the realm of original
[1:01:30] there's a brother in Africa incredible
[1:01:33] artist just such an incredible artist
[1:01:36] and many years ago when sister Jerry and
[1:01:39] I was there
[1:01:40] um
[1:01:41] you know I thought there was a picture
[1:01:43] that he had done and I just I was so
[1:01:46] mesmerized by that I just was like I I
[1:01:48] gotta own this and I asked the brother
[1:01:50] how much is this and when it equated out
[1:01:52] with a calculator from uh the Kruger or
[1:01:55] whatever they call that Rand whatever
[1:01:57] that thing is that they use for currency
[1:01:59] and it was only going to be like seven
[1:02:01] thousand dollars I decided that uh I
[1:02:04] probably really didn't need to own this
[1:02:06] picture so then the next best thing is
[1:02:08] is you know I I would settle for a copy
[1:02:10] of this picture when I found out that
[1:02:12] the copies sold for twenty five hundred
[1:02:14] dollars I decided I would take a picture
[1:02:17] of the picture and I would be good with
[1:02:20] the picture of the picture
[1:02:22] but you see the Apostle Paul is saying
[1:02:25] here that you know what whatever there
[1:02:27] is to be boasted on I can boast of it
[1:02:30] also amen the transforming power amen we
[1:02:34] just read where Satan would come and his
[1:02:36] servants would have a transforming power
[1:02:39] but we have a transforming power and the
[1:02:42] value of our transforming power is so
[1:02:45] much greater than the value of Satan's
[1:02:48] transforming power my brother and sister
[1:02:50] it's Rags to Riches stories always catch
[1:02:53] people's attention oh my this man come
[1:02:55] from nothing and ended up something but
[1:02:57] my brother and sister the wealth of the
[1:02:59] Rich Young Ruler was the same as anyone
[1:03:02] else when his life was called for amen
[1:03:06] no greater gift had God give to that
[1:03:08] young man than it would have been to sir
[1:03:10] have surrendered to the Lord and to give
[1:03:13] it to the poor but it's there that it's
[1:03:16] all in how we place the value and how we
[1:03:19] look at things amen so seeing that the
[1:03:21] glory after the flesh I will glory also
[1:03:24] for you suffer fools gladly seeing
[1:03:27] yourselves are wise
[1:03:29] for ye suffer if a man bring you in to
[1:03:33] bondage
[1:03:35] if a man
[1:03:38] may devour you
[1:03:42] wow
[1:03:45] no longer Satan
[1:03:48] as a roaring lion
[1:03:51] it's now come down to flesh and blood
[1:03:54] anointed by a spirit
[1:03:56] that would come
[1:03:58] and devour
[1:04:00] your lives
[1:04:03] huh
[1:04:07] my daughter Kristen told me about a card
[1:04:09] that she almost bought I'm glad she
[1:04:12] didn't
[1:04:14] he's talking about pastors in it for the
[1:04:16] outcome
[1:04:18] not the income
[1:04:21] wow
[1:04:23] the world out there is recognizing and
[1:04:25] calling it humor
[1:04:27] a spirit
[1:04:28] of a Devourer
[1:04:34] you see it's very subtle
[1:04:36] in other words my brother and sister
[1:04:38] when the devil goes to devour people
[1:04:41] he doesn't do it as a secret behind
[1:04:43] their back he is so subtle
[1:04:46] he literally tells them what's going to
[1:04:50] happen to them
[1:04:52] he allows it he doesn't keep them in a
[1:04:54] vacuum he allows them to see what the
[1:04:57] outcome will be and then convinces him
[1:05:01] that's really truly the outcome that you
[1:05:03] want
[1:05:09] there was a little Filipino lady went to
[1:05:11] church with us for a while here many of
[1:05:13] you remember her
[1:05:16] I'll be the backside the story that many
[1:05:18] of you don't know is about the time she
[1:05:20] quit coming here she started sending
[1:05:21] Paul emails about how she had friends
[1:05:24] that were trapped with a suitcase full
[1:05:26] of money in some airport somewhere I
[1:05:29] don't even remember where it was now
[1:05:30] Ethiopia and she just needed you know a
[1:05:34] few tens of thousands of dollars to
[1:05:37] Ransom her friends so the suitcase full
[1:05:40] of cash could come to America and then
[1:05:42] they would repay me in the hundreds of
[1:05:44] thousands of dollars for giving them
[1:05:47] tens of thousands of dollars to Ransom
[1:05:49] the suitcase
[1:05:51] and of course I spent all your money not
[1:05:53] none of mine
[1:05:56] but you see my brother and sister how
[1:05:58] subtle but yet
[1:06:00] the devil is
[1:06:03] so then you type it into the computer
[1:06:08] and it made Jerry and I wonder had she
[1:06:10] been fleeced herself was trying to get
[1:06:12] her money back because it wasn't a
[1:06:15] uncommon little um what would you call
[1:06:18] that a scheme or
[1:06:19] not uncommon made it all the way on the
[1:06:22] internet
[1:06:25] where are you going brother Paul
[1:06:28] every single scheme
[1:06:32] Satan's got
[1:06:34] in 2022
[1:06:38] can be found
[1:06:40] on the internet
[1:06:45] be rich be famous
[1:06:47] be better looking
[1:06:49] be smarter
[1:06:51] lose weight
[1:06:55] I I you name it
[1:06:58] find love
[1:07:01] everything it's on the internet
[1:07:03] boldly before the people
[1:07:07] and the point I'm trying to make is
[1:07:09] people still fall for it
[1:07:11] people still pursue it because that's
[1:07:14] where their heart is
[1:07:18] and the Gospel of Jesus Christ can be
[1:07:20] found on the internet
[1:07:22] and people are attracted to it
[1:07:24] because that's where their heart is
[1:07:30] I didn't verify it
[1:07:34] the trash
[1:07:37] to the good on the internet runs
[1:07:39] hundreds and hundreds to one
[1:07:43] much more wickedness
[1:07:46] then there is good
[1:07:48] and it gives you a reflection as the
[1:07:50] prophet preached about one in a million
[1:07:52] it gives you a reflection of the spirit
[1:07:54] of the age that we're living in
[1:07:57] that literally it runs into all things
[1:07:59] my brother and sister it wasn't just
[1:08:01] something a prophet preached to a small
[1:08:03] closed audience that would believe it
[1:08:06] but it was there a reflection of the
[1:08:09] spirit in the world in which we live
[1:08:12] amen so if it's there let me hurry on
[1:08:15] here there's so many Avenues I was so
[1:08:18] Disturbed with myself you know because
[1:08:20] if you count the Avenues to detour here
[1:08:22] there is like literally a million like
[1:08:25] going to the largest city you ever
[1:08:27] thought without a road map or a GPS amen
[1:08:30] so you look at this now uh he's saying
[1:08:33] you know what if you suffer if a man
[1:08:35] bring you into bondage if a man devour
[1:08:39] you
[1:08:41] man take of you if a man exalt himself
[1:08:44] if a man Smite you on the face I speak
[1:08:47] as concerning reproach as though we had
[1:08:50] been weak how be it wherein so ever any
[1:08:54] is bold I speak foolishly I am bold also
[1:08:58] are they you know let me just come on
[1:09:00] I'm just having a hard time staying
[1:09:02] focused but look at this my brother and
[1:09:04] sister you see uh those of you and I I
[1:09:07] don't make sound bad or anything but
[1:09:09] those of you listening to Ministries the
[1:09:11] internet has brought a very broad
[1:09:13] spectrum you know maybe we have a a
[1:09:16] Ministry that we like to hear that edify
[1:09:19] strengthens us have you noticed I will
[1:09:22] speak for the bride of Christ first have
[1:09:24] you noticed that the ministry is getting
[1:09:26] bolder
[1:09:30] even denominational Ministry
[1:09:33] is getting bolder
[1:09:36] now I hope this wouldn't offend no one
[1:09:40] but I listened
[1:09:41] to a man on the internet the other day
[1:09:44] that we probably should invite to some
[1:09:46] of our big conferences and let him teach
[1:09:48] message people about marriage and
[1:09:50] divorce
[1:09:52] people blast brother Branham on his
[1:09:54] version of marriage and divorce well I'm
[1:09:57] afraid his version is not his version if
[1:09:59] you believe the Bible and read it it's
[1:10:02] God's version
[1:10:05] and I'm just going to say these words
[1:10:07] and I hope they don't offend no one
[1:10:10] but he said if a man does not have a
[1:10:12] revelation
[1:10:13] that he and his wife are one
[1:10:17] he has no revelation
[1:10:20] of the godhead
[1:10:24] pretty cut and dried
[1:10:27] yeah
[1:10:29] Christ in his church
[1:10:34] we look at this my brother and sister
[1:10:41] there is such strong spirits in the days
[1:10:44] that we live in
[1:10:46] going back to verse 20 real quick if you
[1:10:49] suffer if a man bring you into bondage
[1:10:50] if a man devour you amen this is the
[1:10:54] same devour as it is as Satan as a
[1:10:58] roaring lion seeking who to devour and a
[1:11:01] man take you a man exalt himself a man
[1:11:03] Smite you on the face of a man desire
[1:11:05] and in uh the reference of scripture
[1:11:08] we'll go to revelation 16.
[1:11:12] and verse start with verse 17. now I
[1:11:16] beseech you brother and mark them
[1:11:19] what devour
[1:11:21] yes think
[1:11:24] mark them which cause divisions and
[1:11:27] offenses contrary to the doctrine
[1:11:30] so Doctrine matters
[1:11:32] which he have learned
[1:11:35] and invite them for lunch on Sunday
[1:11:39] some people feel like Brother Paul's may
[1:11:41] be taking a hard line but I'm just
[1:11:43] following the word my brother and sister
[1:11:44] as the Apostle Paul's speaking to the
[1:11:46] Romans he said you know what you ought
[1:11:48] to do you ought to avoid them
[1:11:53] but how are we going to win them back by
[1:11:55] prayer
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] look
[1:12:00] you go wrestle the pig you're both going
[1:12:02] to get dirty and the pig likes it
[1:12:05] is too blunt for you
[1:12:10] because Verse 18 if that's not straight
[1:12:12] Enough For You Verse 18 really ought to
[1:12:14] be straight enough for you
[1:12:16] for they that are such serve not our
[1:12:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:20] but their own belly
[1:12:22] and by good words and fair speeches
[1:12:24] deceive the hearts of the simple
[1:12:27] my brother and sister are kind of
[1:12:28] straightforward but I think we're coming
[1:12:30] into a time in the message in the world
[1:12:33] we live in today that it needs to be
[1:12:34] straightforward
[1:12:36] amen we're going to run out of enough
[1:12:38] sugar to sugarcoat the message my
[1:12:40] brother and sister and finally we're
[1:12:42] going to learn to take it as the
[1:12:44] straight as it were without water down
[1:12:47] or without being sugared up and that
[1:12:49] we'll be able as not people that are
[1:12:52] caught still drinking milk
[1:12:55] but meat
[1:12:59] hmm
[1:13:02] are we doing okay
[1:13:04] I don't need to apologize to anybody yet
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:09] for your obedience has come abroad unto
[1:13:12] all men I am glad therefore on your
[1:13:14] behalf he's now changed a step right
[1:13:16] here because he's now declaring you know
[1:13:19] what you as Believers it has come as a
[1:13:22] notice to all men and let me just boast
[1:13:24] on Grace Tabernacle a little bit many
[1:13:27] people have passed through these doors
[1:13:28] and many people say brother Paul you go
[1:13:31] to church with a lovely lovely group of
[1:13:34] people the atmosphere the spirit that
[1:13:36] it's just that it's wonderful we're so
[1:13:38] happy to have been here and my brother
[1:13:40] and sister aren't you glad that was the
[1:13:42] day you chose to put on that certain
[1:13:44] demeanor
[1:13:48] or is that Who We Are
[1:13:51] is that what the word of God has done to
[1:13:54] us
[1:13:55] oh that doesn't make us all perfect
[1:13:57] every single day in every single
[1:13:59] circumstance but I'm telling you it is
[1:14:02] remarkable how the very nature or Spirit
[1:14:04] even in times of difficulty will shine
[1:14:08] through our attitude and will shine out
[1:14:12] even though the devil is right there
[1:14:14] chewing on your leg
[1:14:16] the devil trying to devour you with that
[1:14:19] moment and God still says I'm going to
[1:14:21] let my nature shine out of you while
[1:14:23] you're over here trying to kick the
[1:14:25] devil off and it affects us as humans my
[1:14:28] brother and sister and if God hadn't
[1:14:30] wanted it that way we wouldn't be that
[1:14:32] way but God made us there that we can go
[1:14:34] through the great trials as a devil
[1:14:36] trying to devour us and still the very
[1:14:39] nature and spirit of Christ will be
[1:14:41] their present and it is that the voice
[1:14:43] of God the nature of God who God is my
[1:14:46] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:14:48] says the spirit of Christ knows the
[1:14:51] spirit of Christ
[1:14:55] Christ in you
[1:14:58] the Holy Ghost doesn't have any problem
[1:15:00] recognizing Who You Are
[1:15:06] so your obedience has come abroad into
[1:15:08] all men and I'm glad therefore on your
[1:15:10] behalf but yet I would have you wise
[1:15:13] unto that which is good and simple
[1:15:15] concerning evil
[1:15:18] you see my brother and sister we don't
[1:15:20] come to church and explain all the
[1:15:22] Deviant behavior of the world all the
[1:15:25] perverted nature of the world now that
[1:15:27] is not what we focus on my brother and
[1:15:29] sister we'll get enough dose of that
[1:15:31] just going outside the doors going to
[1:15:33] work going shopping whatever it is so we
[1:15:35] don't need to focus on that and so as we
[1:15:38] look at this and in a minute you'll say
[1:15:39] well brother Paul you're talking about
[1:15:41] the devil and this so far in the service
[1:15:42] I've only talked about the devil haven't
[1:15:44] I
[1:15:46] and that's good
[1:15:49] that's good I'm good with this
[1:15:51] because we're going to paint a contrast
[1:15:53] today
[1:15:55] don't you love contrast yeah
[1:15:58] yes
[1:16:00] and the God of Peace
[1:16:02] now some of you already read ahead I saw
[1:16:04] you watched your eyeballs going back and
[1:16:06] forth back and forth
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[1:16:13] under your feet shortly
[1:16:15] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:16:18] with you amen so as the Apostle Paul has
[1:16:21] laid out this whole picture of the
[1:16:24] nature of Satan as a roaring lion and
[1:16:27] the nature of men who were men of
[1:16:30] Darkness but have been transformed under
[1:16:32] this anointing from the devil
[1:16:34] transformed into Apostles and and been
[1:16:37] transformed into light and they're
[1:16:39] attracting people to them my brother and
[1:16:42] sister he's laying out this beautiful
[1:16:44] picture but then again he tells you now
[1:16:47] it's going to be shortly just shortly
[1:16:50] here you're going to trample that
[1:16:52] underneath your feet in other words you
[1:16:54] don't need to worry about what is coming
[1:16:56] down the road God's already prepared you
[1:16:59] to rise if you're going to trample it
[1:17:01] under your feet you're not the one in
[1:17:03] the dirt that spirit is in the dirt
[1:17:05] you're not the one that's been overcome
[1:17:07] you're the Overcomer it's not you that's
[1:17:11] going to be here in this world in the
[1:17:13] Judgment coming and saying all Lord what
[1:17:16] happened you the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:19] Sons and Daughters of God by Revelation
[1:17:22] it's being revealed to you and when you
[1:17:25] hear that still Small Voice say step up
[1:17:27] a little higher we don't argue why we
[1:17:30] can't do you realize Lord we're in
[1:17:32] laodicea the spirit of laodicea I can't
[1:17:35] overcome it no my brother and sister you
[1:17:38] can't overcome it and if you will now oh
[1:17:41] I'm going to get myself in trouble here
[1:17:42] but sometimes we need to be parrots
[1:17:46] I don't really like parrots you realize
[1:17:49] they're dirty little birds
[1:17:52] and they're not smart enough to learn
[1:17:53] the alphabet on their own
[1:17:56] somebody's got to teach it to them
[1:17:59] but it's sometimes for us to be parents
[1:18:02] if God said you're an overcomer
[1:18:05] I'm an overcomer
[1:18:10] I'm going to live before the throne I'm
[1:18:12] gonna live before the throne
[1:18:14] I'm going to be at the marriage supper
[1:18:16] I'll be at the marriage supper
[1:18:19] your flash might not even agree with you
[1:18:21] your flesh it's called condemnation your
[1:18:24] flesh is going to say you don't live
[1:18:27] that high but the word says you are
[1:18:31] now who are we going to believe
[1:18:34] or flesh or the word
[1:18:36] because if you believe the flesh let's
[1:18:38] all dismiss and go for pizza
[1:18:41] because that's as close as we're going
[1:18:42] to get
[1:18:48] so look at this now Saints
[1:18:50] Satan
[1:18:52] transforms himself into an angel of
[1:18:54] Light
[1:18:56] what do you want you
[1:18:57] to look at
[1:18:59] is what he wants to appear as
[1:19:06] I was listening to a man who
[1:19:09] pretty much has devoted his whole life
[1:19:12] to finding every flaw there is in the
[1:19:14] Catholic church mostly with Pope
[1:19:17] and he's got a huge list of
[1:19:19] contradictions
[1:19:20] of the Catholic Church
[1:19:24] things that are said
[1:19:26] and then at some other point in time
[1:19:29] repeated in an entirely different
[1:19:32] fashion
[1:19:34] some have credited this man with causing
[1:19:37] the Catholic Church to go back
[1:19:39] and change some of their
[1:19:41] doctrines policies
[1:19:44] because he's exposed
[1:19:50] but the one thing he'll never be able no
[1:19:52] matter how mad or great this man is and
[1:19:54] his ability to research he'll never be
[1:19:57] able to take away from a real true
[1:19:59] Catholic the revelation of Catholicism
[1:20:07] all his work
[1:20:12] won't take it away from them
[1:20:16] and the next step of his work is many
[1:20:18] will come out
[1:20:23] and go right over into
[1:20:25] Catholicism with another name
[1:20:31] our church says
[1:20:34] our literature says
[1:20:36] our Bible says
[1:20:41] and once they've been dislodged from
[1:20:43] their original position the majority of
[1:20:46] them will never be dislodged again
[1:20:48] because it actually turns out to be a
[1:20:49] traumatic event
[1:20:52] it severs families it severs friendships
[1:20:55] it severs all kinds of relationships and
[1:20:58] people say you know we've left a church
[1:21:00] once not doing it again
[1:21:05] but the one who's dislodged
[1:21:09] because of a deep hunger
[1:21:13] the one who's dislodged because their
[1:21:15] soul
[1:21:16] can't be satisfied
[1:21:19] no one
[1:21:21] who realizes
[1:21:23] this was a transformation of light
[1:21:28] and this is light
[1:21:33] what a difference
[1:21:36] yeah
[1:21:40] see you can be transformed my brother
[1:21:42] and sister without the core being
[1:21:44] changed
[1:21:46] in the day that we live in it's called
[1:21:48] plastic surgery
[1:21:51] doesn't change the inside at all
[1:21:54] can make the outside more beautiful
[1:21:56] sorry sisters well I know some brothers
[1:21:58] might have had I don't know did I use
[1:22:00] Brothers I didn't mean that
[1:22:02] women men
[1:22:07] you know the other day I was talking to
[1:22:09] a friend of mine I called him brother
[1:22:10] and he just looked at me real weird but
[1:22:12] I just just said
[1:22:13] maybe I'm being hopeful
[1:22:17] my brother and sister you see what's
[1:22:19] happening is is these Transformations
[1:22:20] that are taking place how this is
[1:22:22] shining there now the prophet of God
[1:22:24] talks about a glare and a real light
[1:22:28] and so you see the transformation brings
[1:22:31] and it comes to a place just in my
[1:22:34] research and studies the other day once
[1:22:36] again coming across the deal a man
[1:22:38] saying well you know the Trinity is so
[1:22:40] complicated and such a revelation it
[1:22:42] can't be explained
[1:22:44] this is after he had talked for 40
[1:22:46] minutes
[1:22:47] on the evidence of the trinity
[1:22:50] and then because it doesn't appear that
[1:22:52] he made much progress he says it can't
[1:22:55] be this
[1:22:56] described or explained because it's so
[1:22:59] deep
[1:23:00] the man he was debating said it's so
[1:23:03] deep because you can't find it
[1:23:05] you're still digging to find it
[1:23:09] my Bible has it right here
[1:23:13] so you see my brother and sister at the
[1:23:16] end of that
[1:23:18] you'll realize more than likely that
[1:23:20] debate never changed a single opinion
[1:23:29] let me hurry on these are all the side
[1:23:30] notes that tumbled through my head I'll
[1:23:32] get to my sermon here in a minute
[1:23:35] amen now
[1:23:37] I would just like to ask everyone
[1:23:41] have you ever asked yourself how can I
[1:23:43] overcome
[1:23:45] a little something in your life a little
[1:23:47] little issue there might be
[1:23:49] if you're used to kids or stealing the
[1:23:51] cookie out of the cookie jar
[1:23:55] read a little story about a kid and it
[1:23:57] just loves stealing cookies out of the
[1:23:58] cookie jar got to the point the mom kept
[1:24:00] an inventory on the cookies in the
[1:24:02] cookie jar because little Johnny was
[1:24:04] wasn't his real name but I don't think
[1:24:06] there's any Johnny's here today
[1:24:09] stole cookies
[1:24:11] finally the mom said if cookies are
[1:24:13] missing out the cookie jar I'm going to
[1:24:15] whip you
[1:24:16] and he literally sat down on a piece of
[1:24:18] paper at the kitchen table and
[1:24:19] scribbling notes on it and the mother
[1:24:21] said what are you doing he said I'm
[1:24:22] trying to figure out if it's worth it or
[1:24:24] not
[1:24:33] how can I overcome I think it's a
[1:24:35] question that many of us
[1:24:38] have asked
[1:24:40] look
[1:24:42] talking about our lord Jesus Temptation
[1:24:44] was for him you know that the Bible said
[1:24:46] he was tempted in all points like we are
[1:24:48] yet without sin he was tempted by
[1:24:51] drinking he was tempted by women he was
[1:24:54] tempted by everything that could be
[1:24:55] tempted by he was tempted by everything
[1:24:58] that we are
[1:25:00] imagine that that leaves us with no
[1:25:02] excuse we say well that there was things
[1:25:04] there wasn't things then as they are now
[1:25:06] saying spirits
[1:25:08] it's just now refined into a electronic
[1:25:11] and Etc
[1:25:13] amen he was a man and yet you couldn't
[1:25:16] put a mark on him yes sir overcome means
[1:25:20] to recognize the devil in every one of
[1:25:24] his tricks
[1:25:25] amen I want to be an overcomer amen
[1:25:28] recognizing that was where the title of
[1:25:32] my sermon today come from my brother and
[1:25:34] sister you see the power of recognizing
[1:25:37] now this is not confined as it was I
[1:25:40] said to you about the devil but you look
[1:25:43] at this and we start to recognize the
[1:25:46] tricks that Satan uses we start to use
[1:25:49] uh his own actions as it were against
[1:25:53] him we see what he's doing to recognize
[1:25:55] the devil in every one of his tricks a
[1:25:57] lot of people says there is no devil
[1:26:00] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:26:01] that there's a real devil he's just as
[1:26:04] real as you are or anybody a real devil
[1:26:07] and you must recognize him real real
[1:26:10] amen let's not just get into the point
[1:26:13] you know people casually like do
[1:26:15] something and you know some people that
[1:26:17] maybe don't have a the depth of
[1:26:18] Revelation or something and they say the
[1:26:20] devil made me do it
[1:26:22] you know what they're actually
[1:26:23] acknowledging
[1:26:25] it's not the devil coming were as it
[1:26:28] were just casually come by but the devil
[1:26:30] then has control
[1:26:34] of their atmosphere
[1:26:36] the devil made me do it in other words
[1:26:38] he come into my atmosphere and he
[1:26:40] tricked me
[1:26:42] okay let's deal with your atmosphere
[1:26:44] then you're focused on the devil maybe
[1:26:46] we ought to focus on the atmosphere amen
[1:26:49] my brother and sisters as it was I
[1:26:51] preached many years ago at a church
[1:26:52] dedication it's there my brother and
[1:26:55] sister the day that we live in is not
[1:26:57] the time for us to worry about keeping
[1:26:59] the devil out of the church
[1:27:02] had a lot of people frown at me
[1:27:05] a lot of people frowned at me and I'm
[1:27:06] not trying to exaggerate that they
[1:27:08] didn't like that we're not in the time
[1:27:10] to worry about keeping the devil out of
[1:27:12] church the prophet of God said the devil
[1:27:15] goes to church and so do we think now we
[1:27:17] can kick the devil out of church no my
[1:27:20] brother and sister we're not going to
[1:27:21] kick the devil out of church but I'll
[1:27:22] tell you what we can do we can get the
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost in us and there'll be no room
[1:27:27] for the devil he'll be able to come to
[1:27:30] church if he wants to but it won't have
[1:27:32] an impact on you and I it won't control
[1:27:35] our life it won't be controlling our
[1:27:38] atmosphere it will no longer be the
[1:27:40] devil made me do it my brother and
[1:27:42] sister because you'll be so full amen I
[1:27:46] tell you I love that little joke I'm
[1:27:47] sorry but I just seen it the other day
[1:27:50] again I don't even you know
[1:27:53] it says you know what happened when the
[1:27:56] mosquito landed on a holy ghost-filled
[1:27:59] Christian
[1:28:00] he flew away singing there's power in
[1:28:03] the blood
[1:28:04] yeah my brother and sister now that's a
[1:28:07] little bit humorous but I'm telling you
[1:28:08] when you come to that place of that
[1:28:11] atmosphere it will no longer be the
[1:28:13] devil the devil the devil the devil
[1:28:15] you'll be able to say there's power in
[1:28:18] the blood amen God's in control of this
[1:28:21] atmosphere God's in control of this
[1:28:23] vessel I have given complete control to
[1:28:26] him and as the old joke or whatever says
[1:28:29] you know some country star said uh uh
[1:28:32] you know Jesus take the wheel and
[1:28:34] somebody had quipped a long time ago
[1:28:36] when that song come out and said what
[1:28:38] about the clutch the gas and the break
[1:28:41] yeah got the wheel but you got your foot
[1:28:44] on the gas
[1:28:45] Benny wants to go forward you got your
[1:28:47] foot on the brake
[1:28:52] there's no devil don't you believe that
[1:28:54] there's a real devil just as real or you
[1:28:56] or anybody a real devil and you must
[1:28:58] recognize him real right it's a
[1:29:01] recognition is the value if you never
[1:29:03] see the devil is real if it's just words
[1:29:05] you heard it preach oh watch out for the
[1:29:07] devil
[1:29:09] well if that just becomes so casual you
[1:29:11] become desensitized to the devil he'll
[1:29:13] be sitting right there as it were and
[1:29:15] controlling your life and you won't even
[1:29:17] know it you must know he's a devil then
[1:29:20] the same time that you recognize him and
[1:29:23] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:29:25] you then to overcome
[1:29:29] look at this Saints what we got to do is
[1:29:32] you know we spend a lot of time can have
[1:29:34] we can spend a lot of time of dealing of
[1:29:36] don't don't don't and this and that and
[1:29:38] whatever and watch out but there Comes A
[1:29:41] Time you must recognize that the god in
[1:29:45] you
[1:29:46] amen not just God but the god in you is
[1:29:50] greater and mightier than he than he is
[1:29:54] that's one that's in you has already
[1:29:57] overcome him
[1:30:00] oh now I used that parrot earlier I hope
[1:30:02] you don't mind me using the parrot again
[1:30:04] now this has to be a personal
[1:30:06] relationship so please understand the
[1:30:08] the example I'm giving you
[1:30:11] but sometimes we should just pair it the
[1:30:14] moving of the spirit of God
[1:30:16] young people
[1:30:18] maybe you'd be saying I've never really
[1:30:21] felt that I don't know I I've been
[1:30:23] raised right I've been raised in church
[1:30:25] I want to serve God but I've never I've
[1:30:28] never really I just don't know what to
[1:30:30] do or how to do it well I'll tell you
[1:30:33] there's an age and that's not like 20 or
[1:30:35] 30 but there's an age for you just to
[1:30:37] pair it the moving of the spirit parrot
[1:30:40] this is why it's important parents that
[1:30:43] are Godly atmosphere in our home we
[1:30:47] can't apply the token and this comes and
[1:30:49] I think probably bites all of us you
[1:30:51] can't apply the token and invite the
[1:30:53] devil to dinner
[1:30:56] that's right applying of the token means
[1:30:59] the token moves in the devil moves out
[1:31:02] amen we must go through our books our
[1:31:05] magazines are this are that whatever it
[1:31:08] is because you're not going to have two
[1:31:11] of them dwell peacefully together
[1:31:14] you say well we have troubles in our
[1:31:15] home well I'll tell you what you just
[1:31:17] invite Jesus invite the devil at the
[1:31:19] same time and see if there isn't trouble
[1:31:21] amen because you're going to see the
[1:31:22] devil get kicked from one end of the
[1:31:24] house to the other you're going to see
[1:31:25] the devil get thrashed and then you're
[1:31:27] going to see him thrown out in the
[1:31:28] driveway and my brother and sister in
[1:31:30] spite of the rock songs of days gone by
[1:31:32] we have no Sympathy for the Devil
[1:31:35] not one drop of Sympathy for the Devil
[1:31:37] he knew when he started deceiving the
[1:31:40] Angels what he was getting into
[1:31:44] no sympathy
[1:31:47] just as our lord Jesus
[1:31:49] the prophet lays it out you can search
[1:31:51] it out very carefully
[1:31:53] long before he ever went
[1:31:57] to Golgotha
[1:32:00] he knew amen
[1:32:08] just come to another Crossroad Brother
[1:32:10] David do I turn left
[1:32:12] it's a cul-de-sac that means I'd have to
[1:32:14] go out there and come back
[1:32:16] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:32:17] sister the whole story of Ruth
[1:32:21] fits it so perfectly
[1:32:24] yes there is one
[1:32:27] who is closer than I
[1:32:31] but last he would lose his inheritance
[1:32:37] the devil already acknowledging I can't
[1:32:39] redeem you
[1:32:41] I cannot redeem you
[1:32:44] I'm not even going to try amen
[1:32:46] amen I'm just gonna
[1:32:48] deceive you
[1:32:51] you'll follow me
[1:32:52] not as redeemed
[1:32:55] as deceived
[1:32:59] the devil's very subtle
[1:33:05] yeah let me read this again sorry to be
[1:33:07] redundant
[1:33:08] then the same time that you recognize
[1:33:10] him and know that he's a devil and he's
[1:33:12] against you
[1:33:13] you know nowhere in here young people
[1:33:16] please hear me
[1:33:17] you will find nowhere in the word of God
[1:33:20] that the devil has a promise to offer
[1:33:23] you other than damnation
[1:33:27] sorry for the strong words
[1:33:30] that's all he's got to offer
[1:33:32] he can offer popularity that's temporary
[1:33:35] can offer wealth that's temporary
[1:33:37] because the minute you take your last
[1:33:38] breath you're no longer rich
[1:33:44] I knew I should have broke this up in
[1:33:45] about 10 parts
[1:33:48] my oh my
[1:33:49] okay let's go forward and by his grace
[1:33:52] you are more than a match for him for
[1:33:54] the devil There's real overcoming when
[1:33:58] you recognize you look back and say I'm
[1:34:00] doing this and I'm doing that then know
[1:34:02] you you're defeated in other words let
[1:34:06] me put it in this term what do you mean
[1:34:07] brother Trevor I come to church every
[1:34:11] time I can every time that there's you
[1:34:13] know and and I I read my Bible and I do
[1:34:17] the prophet Allah says nope nope nope
[1:34:19] nope you failed to recognize this I'm
[1:34:21] doing this I'm doing that then no you
[1:34:24] you're defeated
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:27] right so the very best that you can
[1:34:29] offer
[1:34:30] you're defeated
[1:34:32] the very best I can offer I'm defeated
[1:34:37] reminds me and this is Quite a feat
[1:34:40] I thought this was actually incredible
[1:34:42] the lady if I remember correct was like
[1:34:44] 85 6 7 years old
[1:34:48] received a lifetime award from the
[1:34:50] southern baptist conference in her life
[1:34:53] never missed a church service
[1:34:58] and how many of you can even come close
[1:35:04] Saint Peter
[1:35:06] look at my award
[1:35:13] come on
[1:35:16] come on look at this
[1:35:19] I've been in every church service
[1:35:22] well I'm going to tell you Saints
[1:35:24] hopefully this doesn't turn you off but
[1:35:26] before I really gave my heart to the
[1:35:28] Lord
[1:35:29] I fixed a lot of tractors
[1:35:32] I planted a lot of crops
[1:35:34] I did a lot of things
[1:35:36] in church
[1:35:40] now I just want to be kind and ask you
[1:35:43] willingly to admit what it is you
[1:35:46] accomplished
[1:35:54] now down here we're going to come to
[1:35:57] what I was mentioning earlier
[1:35:59] I was stirred by what our sister Andrea
[1:36:01] had to say see I'm doing this I'm doing
[1:36:03] that no no you're defeated but there's
[1:36:05] no condemnation to those which are in
[1:36:08] Christ Jesus then walk not after the
[1:36:10] flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:36:13] realize you've overcome
[1:36:16] it says no longer this is not a flash
[1:36:18] issue we have flesh issues
[1:36:22] yeah
[1:36:23] yeah the devil will put you in a
[1:36:25] position that something on the way to
[1:36:27] church away home from church or whatever
[1:36:30] it is you'll Foster you'll be upset
[1:36:32] about things that's that's the part that
[1:36:34] Satan comes in and anoints that but the
[1:36:36] thing is my brother and sister I'll just
[1:36:38] admit it I'll tell you what sister Jerry
[1:36:40] and I for from about uh let's see what
[1:36:42] would that be about 10th Avenue down
[1:36:45] here to about
[1:36:46] um uh Midland
[1:36:49] fought on the way to church
[1:36:52] I guess it was this side of Midland just
[1:36:54] a little ways if you want to come after
[1:36:56] church I'll show you the point
[1:37:00] and it was over nothing
[1:37:02] you realize it was just the devil
[1:37:05] just a devil
[1:37:10] but do you know how you know you're an
[1:37:11] overcomer
[1:37:14] when you didn't willfully
[1:37:16] okay spirit
[1:37:18] let me escort you into church
[1:37:21] and I'll walk you right up to the second
[1:37:24] row
[1:37:25] and we'll go to church together
[1:37:29] now if you guys have been following us
[1:37:30] down the highway this morning you would
[1:37:32] have said what did I just see did they
[1:37:34] throw trash out the window no it was
[1:37:36] just the devil
[1:37:39] that's what you ought to do Saints
[1:37:41] he never said you're going to be perfect
[1:37:42] never make a mistake never have a
[1:37:44] thought never have a deed never have a
[1:37:45] this or half of that but he said that
[1:37:47] you would always come back to the word
[1:37:50] he said that you would always seek the
[1:37:52] spirit of Christ and that is a spirit of
[1:37:55] reconciliation
[1:37:57] amen now look at this see walk not after
[1:38:01] the flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:38:02] realize you've overcome and you know
[1:38:04] that he is the devil you can't say now
[1:38:07] this is going to be I need you to pay
[1:38:09] attention
[1:38:10] you can't say
[1:38:12] I got a sickness and the end and I I I I
[1:38:17] don't believe it as a sickness
[1:38:20] see this is why how we confess is very
[1:38:23] important
[1:38:24] people would be like about ready to drop
[1:38:26] dead and think of I'm not sick
[1:38:29] they believe they're standing
[1:38:31] in what we would consider a Biblical or
[1:38:33] message position
[1:38:35] I'll give no part to the devil I won't
[1:38:37] speak the devil's language but I got
[1:38:39] this quote for you
[1:38:42] I got a sickness and I I I don't believe
[1:38:45] it's a sickness oh yes
[1:38:47] it's a sickness
[1:38:50] it seems contrary to some of our
[1:38:51] thinking right not to acknowledge one
[1:38:53] thing about what the devil's doing
[1:38:56] you got cancer don't believe it is a
[1:38:59] cancer it is a cancer
[1:39:01] it is a cancer but remember
[1:39:05] come on Remember
[1:39:07] come on Saint somebody say it with me
[1:39:10] remember
[1:39:13] amen greater is he that is in you than
[1:39:17] he's in the world you must realize that
[1:39:20] the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[1:39:23] already overcome
[1:39:26] and we think we're being spiritual we
[1:39:28] think we're being a giant I don't know I
[1:39:31] don't have nothing wrong with me you're
[1:39:33] withering away
[1:39:35] why don't you say yes the doctor says
[1:39:38] it's a cancer it's a this it's a that
[1:39:41] but I serve a God I serve a god that is
[1:39:45] greater than all of these things amen
[1:39:48] the denial of your circumstance is not
[1:39:52] overcoming it
[1:39:56] well might for a moment go oh oh look at
[1:39:58] that let's acknowledge they've got
[1:39:59] cancer yes they just acknowledge it but
[1:40:02] when it comes from your mouth but
[1:40:05] my Lord that word says I'm already
[1:40:10] healed the Devil by what
[1:40:13] yes right I thought I had you convinced
[1:40:15] that part didn't matter
[1:40:17] well I'll tell you what there's some
[1:40:18] churches that it would be convinced
[1:40:20] already but we're not that one we're one
[1:40:23] that believes in the saving of the soul
[1:40:25] and the healing of the body amen we
[1:40:28] believe in the outpouring of the Holy
[1:40:30] Ghost we believe in the word coming to
[1:40:32] life in flesh and walking on the earth
[1:40:34] once again amen Hallelujah
[1:40:38] oh you must realize the Holy Spirit
[1:40:40] that's in you has already overcome this
[1:40:43] thing and he's in you and you can
[1:40:47] overcome by him that's exactly
[1:40:51] sensible
[1:40:54] I was talking to a man one time he gave
[1:40:56] me about 10 compliments about how that I
[1:40:59] was such a sensible down to earth smart
[1:41:06] and because of all those things
[1:41:09] he was like that's why you ought to take
[1:41:11] your church away from the message
[1:41:14] preach the Bible to them
[1:41:17] and I told them that's what I do brother
[1:41:18] no you're preaching this message
[1:41:21] I said no I'm preaching this Bible
[1:41:25] we had a lot of conversations until he
[1:41:28] finally just quit
[1:41:29] communicating with me which is sad
[1:41:31] because I kind of actually was enjoying
[1:41:33] it because you know what it does it
[1:41:34] forces us out of our little comfort zone
[1:41:37] that's right
[1:41:38] oh you know these people believe like I
[1:41:41] do I just love to fellowship with them
[1:41:45] and these over here kinda those back
[1:41:48] there not so much
[1:41:50] come on
[1:41:53] you know the reason I really like these
[1:41:55] people
[1:41:56] they never challenge me about the
[1:41:58] message
[1:41:59] so we all just say we're Believers and
[1:42:02] it's really good and you know what I
[1:42:04] don't like about them
[1:42:06] as they're constantly talking about now
[1:42:08] did you read and understand what brother
[1:42:09] brownham said
[1:42:13] foreign
[1:42:14] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:42:20] you need challenged
[1:42:23] I need challenged
[1:42:25] it's in the challenge
[1:42:27] that we dig deeper it's in the challenge
[1:42:31] that we something Rises up and we say I
[1:42:34] I need to know amen I want to know Lord
[1:42:37] show me but if you're never challenged
[1:42:40] Saints
[1:42:42] I've told the story here in church about
[1:42:43] the man
[1:42:45] that was well on his way to the Olympics
[1:42:49] I don't remember he ran like the 800
[1:42:51] meter
[1:42:52] and um you know which is basically 800
[1:42:55] meter sprint because if you're the guy
[1:42:57] who slows down you're the guy who loses
[1:43:00] and he ripped his Achilles tendon
[1:43:04] everybody said his career is over
[1:43:08] he went to surgery the doctor said well
[1:43:10] I did the very best I can do a renowned
[1:43:13] orthopedic surgeon best I can do but I'd
[1:43:16] rather doubt you'll ever run again
[1:43:21] and he kept working at it working at it
[1:43:23] got better got better got to worry beat
[1:43:26] almost everybody you might say in a
[1:43:28] regional context
[1:43:30] got up to a higher level
[1:43:31] was beaten
[1:43:33] and somewhat severely
[1:43:39] and he kept telling the coach coach
[1:43:40] you're not doing something right and the
[1:43:42] coach said I'm doing everything right
[1:43:43] you're the one that's not doing it right
[1:43:44] and they would argue and they'd get in a
[1:43:46] fight
[1:43:47] and one day
[1:43:49] he's out there and he runs and he
[1:43:51] hobbles to a stop
[1:43:53] the coach comes over and he tears into
[1:43:55] the coach
[1:43:57] and the coach just listens patiently
[1:44:02] and very methodically starts to tell him
[1:44:05] you're never going to run as an Olympic
[1:44:07] Athlete again
[1:44:10] you have no endurance
[1:44:13] you have no heart
[1:44:15] you don't have the mind for it you have
[1:44:18] nothing going for you you are a failure
[1:44:23] this young man is shaking with anger out
[1:44:26] there
[1:44:37] and all the time before Saints when he
[1:44:40] was in church I mean on the track
[1:44:44] and he reached that certain little spot
[1:44:46] he just stopped right there
[1:44:50] said it's kind of painful
[1:44:53] I can't go any further than that that's
[1:44:54] for the prophet I mean that's for others
[1:44:58] maybe for my pastor I can't do that
[1:45:04] and the shame of his coach tearing into
[1:45:07] him
[1:45:08] caused him
[1:45:09] to run harder and work harder and harder
[1:45:14] and harder and harder
[1:45:18] and he thought I'll get a new coach
[1:45:21] but no coaches would take him
[1:45:23] they say what we hear is is
[1:45:25] you're done
[1:45:35] and he dug deeper
[1:45:39] and he fought the devil harder
[1:45:42] and he resisted more
[1:45:45] and declared I'm not a quitter I'm an
[1:45:47] overcomer
[1:45:50] declared I will outrun context now every
[1:45:55] Spirit of laodicea
[1:46:01] and the day he eclipsed
[1:46:03] the fastest
[1:46:05] time ran that year in the United States
[1:46:09] was the day as he come to a halt his
[1:46:12] coach come out threw his arms around him
[1:46:16] jumping up and down and said I knew you
[1:46:19] could do it I knew you could do it I
[1:46:22] knew you could do and he said no you
[1:46:24] didn't he says well
[1:46:26] I just had to do something
[1:46:29] to get you out
[1:46:30] of your atmosphere
[1:46:35] I'm kind of wondering church if any of
[1:46:37] us from grace are going to actually make
[1:46:39] a rapture
[1:46:41] I don't know if we can run far enough
[1:46:42] and fast enough and overcome enough I
[1:46:45] don't know
[1:46:46] I don't think it's going to work like
[1:46:47] this though is it
[1:46:49] y'all just looking at me like
[1:46:51] now
[1:46:53] now what's wrong with you preacher
[1:46:56] speak for yourself
[1:46:59] but sometimes we need a reckoning
[1:47:02] we need to come face to face are we
[1:47:04] really running the race
[1:47:07] are we running in the pack with everyone
[1:47:09] else
[1:47:13] some of you are looking downright mean
[1:47:15] here
[1:47:17] my
[1:47:19] yep
[1:47:21] and you know sometimes things
[1:47:23] should just be sensible
[1:47:26] come on everything doesn't have to be
[1:47:28] deep and spiritual some things can just
[1:47:31] be sensible
[1:47:33] like how do you feel after you pray and
[1:47:36] read your Bible
[1:47:38] if you say well I feel condemned
[1:47:42] then you're not running the race
[1:47:43] correctly because you haven't recognized
[1:47:45] the devil yet
[1:47:47] because the devil's going to tell you
[1:47:48] even in your most victorious day on this
[1:47:51] Earth is going to tell you you failed
[1:47:56] he's going to tell you right after
[1:47:58] you've prayed through
[1:48:00] that you didn't pray enough
[1:48:03] he's going to tell you after God's
[1:48:05] answers your prayers
[1:48:07] gives you spiritual wisdom to step
[1:48:09] forward into the calling of your life
[1:48:11] the devil's going to say I think you're
[1:48:13] making a mistake
[1:48:16] you're going to be like that young man
[1:48:18] that track star
[1:48:20] ran till it was painful
[1:48:23] and then stopped
[1:48:26] some of you
[1:48:27] forgive me this morning
[1:48:30] you only run
[1:48:33] until it becomes painful
[1:48:36] and you're stopping
[1:48:40] you want to win the race
[1:48:42] keep running amen
[1:48:44] amen amen
[1:48:47] come on don't just go tell it's painful
[1:48:49] because the devil will make everything
[1:48:50] painful
[1:48:53] come on
[1:48:56] let me just hurry on here
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:00] you see my brother and sister in every
[1:49:02] form of warfare there's things that work
[1:49:05] and things that don't
[1:49:07] and you know we have to recognize the
[1:49:10] devil's tactics and I would say to win
[1:49:13] in this layout to see an age
[1:49:16] we definitely have to recognize Satan's
[1:49:19] tactics but the more important is that
[1:49:23] we recognize and you can find this go in
[1:49:25] the message search and look it up
[1:49:26] brother Brown talks about
[1:49:28] we got to recognize God's tactics
[1:49:31] I prayed for 10 years for healing maybe
[1:49:33] you haven't been preparing it correctly
[1:49:41] brother Brown uses that it's a direct
[1:49:42] quote tactics of healing
[1:49:46] amen so we got to come and recognize the
[1:49:48] tactics of God and sometimes the tactics
[1:49:51] of God is that we have to give up our
[1:49:53] ideas and accept his
[1:49:55] amen now brother Branham says here in
[1:49:58] this sudden secret going away of the
[1:50:00] church
[1:50:01] now that's the way the church ought to
[1:50:03] be watching for the coming of the Lord
[1:50:05] all in order already all packed up and
[1:50:08] ready to go as soon as he comes because
[1:50:10] it'll be a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:50:12] eye just trying to time how long it
[1:50:15] would take your eye to twinkle and
[1:50:16] that's just how quick the Rapture of the
[1:50:18] church will take place
[1:50:19] you know the enemy always used oh I
[1:50:22] forgot honestly I forgot this quote was
[1:50:24] it about tactics
[1:50:26] I was actually thinking of another one
[1:50:27] you know the enemy always uses the
[1:50:30] tactics that the Lord uses you know when
[1:50:33] he seen that God was going to have a
[1:50:35] righteous church and the things that he
[1:50:38] was going to do the enemy used that same
[1:50:40] strategy and he's got a church he's got
[1:50:44] a people that's very religious and
[1:50:46] they're just right on the toe as
[1:50:49] religious people because he knows that
[1:50:51] Christ Church is the same way
[1:50:55] so just being religious my brother and
[1:50:57] sister is not enough we have to
[1:50:58] recognize as I started the service with
[1:51:01] amen that there would be those false
[1:51:04] Apostles that would come in and they
[1:51:06] came in and they are going to be very
[1:51:09] devoted very dedicated very on the ball
[1:51:12] the prophet of God said they might even
[1:51:14] be more so than the real bride of Christ
[1:51:17] but my brother and sister it won't do
[1:51:19] them a bit of good unless they got the
[1:51:21] Holy Ghost
[1:51:22] amen a new birth
[1:51:24] that's right right not an anointing
[1:51:26] people be anointed in the flesh
[1:51:29] I'm telling you you talk about anointed
[1:51:31] you know a man walking down the street
[1:51:32] average old man looks over and somebody
[1:51:35] changing a car tire and the car fell
[1:51:37] over and pinned the man there is
[1:51:38] crushing him and an average old man went
[1:51:40] over there and grabbed the car and
[1:51:41] picked it up while somebody else pulled
[1:51:42] the man out
[1:51:44] how could he do that and they'd say we
[1:51:46] need to take you to the hospital you
[1:51:47] probably torn ligaments and tendons and
[1:51:49] this and that they take him to the
[1:51:50] hospital nothing wrong with them
[1:51:52] shows the power that's in us that we
[1:51:54] don't even know is there
[1:51:56] and I'm telling you when we get face to
[1:51:58] face with the devil my brother and
[1:51:59] sister there's so much more power in
[1:52:01] this bride of Christ than she recognizes
[1:52:04] that we get back and you know why it is
[1:52:06] oh I hope this doesn't hurt your feelers
[1:52:07] but it's because we only run till it
[1:52:10] hurts
[1:52:13] we only serve
[1:52:15] till it hurts
[1:52:17] we only say Amen
[1:52:22] until it hurts
[1:52:28] come on you don't think so look I'm
[1:52:31] gonna here let me just take my wet towel
[1:52:35] come on you don't think there's a
[1:52:36] preacher you don't see that in church
[1:52:39] you hit on something
[1:52:42] and that guy that was there a minute ago
[1:52:43] or that sister you praise the Lord
[1:52:45] praise the Lord
[1:52:52] that's why you're supposed to if you
[1:52:53] can't say Amen at least say ouch
[1:52:57] we'll know you're still alive
[1:53:01] let's not be a church that just runs
[1:53:03] till it hurts
[1:53:05] let's be a church that's already
[1:53:06] committed to run the race
[1:53:08] amen I just read a lovely little deal
[1:53:11] this took place back in about
[1:53:13] um
[1:53:14] oh my I think it might have been the
[1:53:16] very same year that the Balmer bombed
[1:53:19] the marathon back east
[1:53:21] it's a man started that
[1:53:26] when he got you know they had a point
[1:53:27] they cut off the race because of what
[1:53:29] happened
[1:53:33] and a fireman stopped this man and said
[1:53:36] sir when he put you in an ambulance and
[1:53:37] he said I'm doing fine
[1:53:39] and I said sir when blood is running out
[1:53:41] of your shoes
[1:53:43] you're not doing fine
[1:53:47] then they thought maybe he was crazy
[1:53:50] because he's shuffling along the Route
[1:53:51] with blood coming out of his shoes like
[1:53:54] this guy's deranged
[1:53:56] and he says oh no no it's been come out
[1:53:59] of my shoes for a couple miles now
[1:54:01] but I told myself
[1:54:04] I was finishing the race
[1:54:14] what are you going to tell yourself this
[1:54:16] morning
[1:54:21] I hope I finish the race
[1:54:26] if I train enough I surely would finish
[1:54:28] the race
[1:54:31] you realize Saints as much as we talk
[1:54:33] about faith faith also applies itself in
[1:54:36] the spirit
[1:54:37] and in the mind
[1:54:40] and you can sit here this morning and
[1:54:42] say that doesn't apply to me
[1:54:44] and in your world it doesn't apply
[1:54:49] because you told yourself
[1:54:52] you can sit in church and say I don't
[1:54:54] believe the message the way he's
[1:54:55] preaching it
[1:54:57] and then all good things that would
[1:54:59] bless just they just go to the Wayside
[1:55:02] because of what the mind
[1:55:05] you see I'm closing if the musicians
[1:55:09] would come
[1:55:12] you see what's happening my brother and
[1:55:14] sisters
[1:55:16] we're not here just to learn the devil's
[1:55:18] tactics
[1:55:20] which the prophet of God said reasoning
[1:55:22] was one of his tactics
[1:55:25] it's where he got Eve was to reason with
[1:55:27] the word
[1:55:28] we're here to learn the Lord's tactics
[1:55:31] prophet of God speaks of the Lord's
[1:55:33] tactics God's tactics and healing and
[1:55:35] deliverance and receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:55:39] to recognize the leadership of the Holy
[1:55:41] Spirit you realize how important that is
[1:55:43] I'm telling you I've been in Services
[1:55:45] where people were healed and other
[1:55:48] people walked out of church and said
[1:55:51] that's probably the worst sermon I've
[1:55:53] ever heard in my life
[1:55:56] why
[1:55:58] one had learned
[1:56:00] Here I Am Lord
[1:56:04] Here I Am Lord
[1:56:07] I've got nothing else to give of myself
[1:56:11] and another said it was too long it was
[1:56:14] too convoluted disjointed
[1:56:17] didn't even make sense
[1:56:20] and someone else walks out a baptism of
[1:56:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:56:25] to recognize the Lord's leading
[1:56:29] now I know there's a little direct today
[1:56:31] but I didn't sign up for this job to
[1:56:33] make you all happy all the time
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:41] of the Lord my brother and sister
[1:56:46] oh
[1:56:47] I think sometimes we can say well I felt
[1:56:50] the moving of the spirit but where did
[1:56:52] it move you
[1:56:54] then move you closer
[1:56:56] then move you farther away
[1:56:59] did it move you to turn your thoughts to
[1:57:02] something else did it move you to think
[1:57:04] on Christ
[1:57:06] what is the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:09] we need that leadership
[1:57:12] I hear it all the time
[1:57:14] you meet up with Believers of this
[1:57:16] message
[1:57:18] you talk to them
[1:57:20] and so many of them want you to know how
[1:57:22] many years they've followed the message
[1:57:27] I'd like to know how many years you've
[1:57:30] been on fire
[1:57:33] you realize this is an old man's
[1:57:36] metaphorical thing about serving God
[1:57:39] he said they say praise the Lord I'm
[1:57:41] like firewood and I get thrown in the
[1:57:44] fire I burn hot and I burn bright
[1:57:48] and this old man says I'm sorry to tell
[1:57:50] you
[1:57:51] this actually is the back of the wood
[1:57:53] shed
[1:57:54] and this wood has never seen the light
[1:57:56] of day for 40 years
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:03] come on
[1:58:05] do I need to explain that a little
[1:58:07] different two years you catch it
[1:58:10] you'll burn bright if you're in the fire
[1:58:13] but if you're in the back of the
[1:58:14] woodshed you ain't doing nothing
[1:58:18] now firewood doesn't have legs it can't
[1:58:21] go through itself in the fire but you do
[1:58:24] you do
[1:58:26] you do
[1:58:29] come on we need to recognize the
[1:58:31] leadership of the Lord
[1:58:32] I've heard people now this is going to
[1:58:34] be a little caustic sounding and I'm
[1:58:36] closing I've heard people
[1:58:38] spoke it to my face I've been in the
[1:58:40] presence of it for years say well the
[1:58:42] Lord spoke to me to do this this and
[1:58:45] this
[1:58:46] six months a year five years later
[1:58:48] they're going on another
[1:58:51] the Lord told me to do this
[1:58:53] that's contradictory to this which one's
[1:58:56] right you either got lied to then or
[1:58:57] you're getting lied to now
[1:58:59] or possibly both times
[1:59:03] come on Saints don't use that as an
[1:59:04] excuse to justify it I prayed through
[1:59:06] the Lord spoke me to do it you take it
[1:59:08] back
[1:59:09] run it across the arrow funnel
[1:59:14] there's where it matters across the
[1:59:17] Earth
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:25] Hallelujah let's just stand up
[1:59:28] because I'm telling you
[1:59:30] I have got so much I could just go on
[1:59:34] what I do want to say to you though
[1:59:37] please don't spend your time focused on
[1:59:39] the devil
[1:59:41] focus on the word
[1:59:45] have a prayer life
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:49] have a
[1:59:51] request life
[1:59:54] a fleece
[1:59:56] as it is
[1:59:59] how many of you have fleeces
[2:00:01] yeah
[2:00:02] I would like to encourage each and every
[2:00:04] one of you if you don't have a fleece
[2:00:05] you start reading the scripture you pray
[2:00:07] about it put a fleece before Lord
[2:00:09] I just listened to a testimony of a
[2:00:11] youth service where a young man who is
[2:00:14] the kid who's secretly drinking secretly
[2:00:16] doing all these things corrupting some
[2:00:18] of the young people in the church and
[2:00:21] everybody was just rabid about this
[2:00:23] young man just keep him away or not be
[2:00:25] even here and whatever and you know
[2:00:27] after a service he went and he was
[2:00:29] walking back and forth in a in a barn
[2:00:31] and he's like okay I need something
[2:00:34] something in my life better change God
[2:00:36] if this is real please show me
[2:00:39] and he puts a fleece before the Lord
[2:00:43] and the very next youth service the
[2:00:46] minister
[2:00:48] calls him right out says you young man
[2:00:52] stand up tell the Lord you love him
[2:00:55] people thought that is ridiculous
[2:01:00] ridiculous telling that young
[2:01:02] not him
[2:01:05] not him
[2:01:06] [Music]
[2:01:08] the young man weeping stood up said Lord
[2:01:11] I love you
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:13] and shared that was this very fleece
[2:01:18] you need a change in your life Saints
[2:01:21] I need a change in my life sometimes you
[2:01:24] act like no no everything's good no
[2:01:26] everyone needs a change in their mind
[2:01:28] start putting fleeces you got some
[2:01:30] things in your life you need answers for
[2:01:32] amen you need a child saved
[2:01:35] put that fleece out there Lord this is
[2:01:38] what we need Lord this is what you need
[2:01:40] a husband a wife a child a whatever
[2:01:43] friendships relationships family things
[2:01:45] you need to just be getting up and say
[2:01:47] now look Lord this is what I need don't
[2:01:49] get down oh Lord let's all fall apart
[2:01:52] Lord this is what I need you said that

[2:02:14] right here and
[2:02:16] participate if you want to you don't
[2:02:17] have to but I'm going to lift my hands
[2:02:19] and say Lord reveal yourself to me Lord
[2:02:22] I want you to reveal yourself to me like

[2:02:51] Christ let me recognize your presence
[2:02:53] Lord
[2:02:54] he doesn't always advertise Saints
[2:02:57] he doesn't always advertise sometimes he
[2:03:00] comes and he stands with us
[2:03:03] and just wait for us to acknowledge Him
[2:03:07] oh Hallelujah
