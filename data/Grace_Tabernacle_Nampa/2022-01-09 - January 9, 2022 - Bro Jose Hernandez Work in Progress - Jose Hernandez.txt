praising myself [Music] this is my story [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know there's many stories in the world today aren't you glad that you can make that your story that being able to say that i serve a risen savior you know i have kind of a varied interest of things and curiosities and i was listening to a um a a man in a conversation as it were uh with an lds gentleman and they were discussing the differences and i thought you know isn't that interesting one of the things they question the lds faith on is that their personal close relationship in this lds gentleman is saying now we don't believe we're just saved we believe we are literally the sons and daughters of god and i thought isn't that interesting how that they articulate that because literally aren't you glad today you can say he's my father amen we're not just looking at somebody who come and paid a ransom for us and had no connection to us but the very fact we were in him before the foundation of the world amen brother ivan sister nadia you didn't make it very far amen well i was surprised sister nadia come walking in i'm like i've been telling everybody they've went away for the weekend so anyway hopefully i didn't bring up sore spot there i just wanted to take a moment i want to speak not only to the church but my brother jose saints ever since i met brother jose many years ago i felt a very kindred spirit with him and knowing that his very nature getting to know his family and so you know one i want to share i don't take any thunder away from brother jose but his son was recently went joey went to his um i think final checkup isn't it and they have declared him completely free from i guess you would call that leukemia wouldn't it be considered leukemia completely free not a sign of it in his body amen we serve an awesome god amen and we have a living testimony right in our midst this morning that our god is a healer amen and i just want to say this i love and i appreciate this family very very much and this morning i want us grace i want us to just pull really hard on the word and i want brother jose to say now i'm not a very good preacher i want him to eliminate that this morning and i want him to eliminate i'm hard to understand and i want him to preach this morning with absolute confidence that the lord divine divinely brought him he sends me a text how are you brother paul i give him the i'm painting baseboard and then he says do you need help and i said yes you want to be a farmer and he says no anyway we text a little bit and then i hear a knock on the door yesterday afternoon and i go down to the door and i hear a little girl's voice and i open the door and their sweet little grace standing there looking up at me and i thought my that's interesting jose hiding on one side and sister cephei on the other but you know i'd been praying yesterday afternoon lord um you know just just kind of feel hesitant i don't know sister jerry and i discuss it might not be the right words but i didn't really share this completely with brother jose but i uh i had a bad day yesterday and you know i just was working here at the church brother adam was here yesterday morning working and then working on through the day there and i just was kind of feeling a little bit down and i was praying lord you know just something special i really feel like this was you know oh saints i can't express myself you know when you pray the word tells us that the answer is already on the way so about the time yesterday i was praying lord do i call brother david do i call brother chris what do i do lord i just feel this hesitancy about you know i have thoughts and then a text phone call and i really felt like the answer was already on the way so let's just pull on the word this morning and just just plan on leaving today blessed god bless you saints god bless you now i can hear you can you hear me god bless each and every one of you it's always a pleasure being here in this place and uh i uh i was tempted to give him give a broad pulse surprise to just to show up and this morning here and for some reason i just i couldn't do it but uh uh my wife was like let's give him give him a surprise i said yeah i want to but some something tells me not to do it i i was gonna text brother jason or or chris or i second just let him know that i'm here i said no these guys i won't say they're not gonna keep the secrets uh i better showed up so that's when i started texting him and uh you know um i was uh talking or i call brother day their day and uh and i say hey brother when are you planning to visit us again uh he went to nicaragua and honduras and uh had a uh he worked hard over there a couple weeks or three weeks and now and uh then he came back and the weather holidays and the weather you can blame anything right but i'm glad he made it back home he's he's back in in texas he's at least he's closer he's on the side of the border now and uh just another side of the country but still god bless brother dave and his family down there we uh brother jim went to uh him and his wife has have a business of rocks they buy and sell rocks sister makes little nice jewelry of rocks i mean you you see an ugly rock she turns into beautiful something there and you see an ugly car brother jim turns into a nice car worth of forty thousand dollars so i mean there's some some people they can do things right but uh he said we're i'm not gonna be here this weekend so uh uh i just need prayers traveling mercies and so my other sister was uh taking care of her mom sister connie and then i said well i'm gonna take my whole congregation with me and let's go visit brother paul so here we are and uh this is like my my second home church here so i uh like brother paul was saying i just feel the same way since i met him which is i think we shared this before but i uh um i just we got a some connection there and that's the grace of god you know i know then later found out that he is sagittarius as well so i'm saying oh there is so sagittarius people they're nice people just kidding just kidding ask my wife sometimes we trouble but you know uh there's got it was one guy says trouble is my last name but that's not my last name my last name is hernandez and i i belong from a lineage way beyond the hernandez so it's the blood of jesus christ and uh and that's where all uh so uh sagittarius or whatever is is nothing related to it but i mean when you love the lord you're gonna love his children and and uh you know just reading the bible i find out that and you know that too that we are the body of jesus christ and then it doesn't matter how small the member is is as important as the biggest one but uh we're just grateful to the lord because we've been i don't think she's speaking about me but i think all been through some valleys and some mountains and again valley and and sometimes the valley feels like it's longer than mountain you know it's just but uh just thinking about all these things that are um the the the christian faces in life but there is always like brother paul was saying help is on the way so it's always we're in trouble but you know help is in the way and it is uh i've been meditating on a lot on this uh thought is and i will call it a work in progress because i feel like i'm a work in progress so that's that's my thought for this warning if you bear with me i always aim to to speak like 30 40 minutes max and then all of a sudden i see my my son in the back with the paper says one hour so uh so i try not to do that here but i just pray for me uh i always like to uh start before i start i haven't started brother paul before i start i would like to sing a song with jason and you guys uh uh what what do you have let's uh let's sing uh god send his son god sent his son because because he lives [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] because he lives i can face tomorrow gone [Music] we [Music] [Music] my grace [Music] uncertain days because [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because healing and then one day i cross the river is [Music] [Music] of [Music] amen i can face tomorrow because [Music] my future [Music] amen as we stand if we can open the book of psalms psalms 34. psalms 34 and 17. i was going to present my wife but she's hiding somewhere with grace but uh i happy to be here again with my wife and kids and uh it's just a blessing that i think when when you find a your loved one that is interested in the same business you're in is the best thing you can have yeah amen and i don't know why but i always come here and i'll get emotional so forgive me for that so uh psalms 34. you know before we go there i i would like to back up a little go back a little bit verse six it says this poor man cried out and the lord hear him and save him out of all his troubles then 17 says the righteous cried out and to the lord cried out and the lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles the lord is near to those who have broken heart and save such as contrite contrite spirit this is the part that i like and i enjoy most many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of all of them can you repeat that with me please many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of them all he he guards his bones now one of them is broken it says and if you go if you go to john 19 36 that's when when when the they were trying to break his bones and they found out that he was already dead so he didn't they didn't do it and i'm so glad that we got through many tribulations in life many hardships but you know what you'd be glad that his body never be broken that's amazing right then uh let's go to the book of second timothy uh 3 verse 11. i'm reading the new james king james version so might sound different than yours second theme of 311 reads like this persecutions afflictions which happened to me in antioch and aquanium lystra what persecutions i endure and out of them all the lord deliver me yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and imposters will grow worse and worse deceiving and be being deceived let's pray heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity lord thank you for having us here lord have a wonderful trip yesterday father and father we just glad to be here in the house of the lord and and and just impart to this uh portion of the bride lord it's just a tremendous weight on over my shoulders father but i know that you can come and speak to them and push me away lord we ask you these things and help us lauren thank you for your love and mercy to us thank you and let me love jesus christ amen you may be seated i just want to say that appreciate brother paul's confidence again and uh i appreciate you for your patience and and uh if i'm just praying that um for for some reason i i see it coming that uh i was gonna be speaking today so i kind of back on my head i was preparing and honestly it's a privilege that someone can trust their pulpit and i appreciate that very much and uh like i said i feel this is like my second home church so i know that i'll be forgiven if i say something backwards or i i told a guy the other day you you build backwards and he says no not backwards different so if i say something different i was uh looking into this uh psalms here and it says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord is gonna deliver you know just thinking over and over of of uh this uh situation here and uh and uh remember my thought is a work in progress so uh you know for any anything whatever you do in life since since the day you were born you're born into uh you're getting into a challenge if a baby is born he is going to have a difficulty to find the breast of mom to start because that's the first thing they want to do and they find out that it's difficult so they just move their head and they don't know where to go so the mom has to help them and and put them in the right spot so you know since the day we we're born we have challenge in life and as we grow the challenges are heavier and heavier or more difficult right and it's it's the same way with the christian life we we're born we're a newborn creature and we're have the we still have the honey and the and then the calm and and oh everything is good and yeah but uh when the first trial comes we shake us all the honey that was left there so and then we have to grasp and whatever you you can to grab hold on and and if you want to make it you have to fight for it if even though jesus christ jesus christ came and paid the price for us we they had to pay a price for not for me but i had to pay a price to deliver the same uh salvation that i have we have to pay the price for the others because that's that's the reason we are christians what what's what is a christian is christ like what he did i i'm not i'm not asking you to to raise dead people or feed a thousand people 5 000 people with couple fishes but i'm just trying to let's just do the basics how's that i mean which is feel the need you see a need you go go for it and do whatever you can you don't need to give a million dollars but you just give them what they need maybe they just need a hug just give them a hug and that's it maybe they just they just need a glass of milk just give them a glass of milk doesn't cost any but we are in a in a world that we have trials we have temptations and we have a tough time but you know what when you go back and read the bible and we have this confidence this assurance brother jason's uh songs is blessed assurance and that we have assurance it doesn't matter how hard it is right now he made it possible so he's not going to let us fight alone as long we stay with the world because we want to be smart enough to say oh i can handle this on my own i'm sorry but you're gonna you're gonna go to a place where it's gonna be hard for you to come out alone then you go verse six says these poor man cry out and the lord here hurt him we have the proof we cry out to the lord he's gonna that's a promise now remember this the righteous man you're doing evil says the the bible says that god doesn't pay attention to the evil people he's focused on the righteous people looking out to do his will i know we're going to make mistakes he knows we're going to make mistakes but he's still there because we're righteous and we we do mistakes because we're just human beings and sometimes we we think we're smart enough but we're full and get to that but i was uh going to share with you something here that we we know that we we know affliction sometimes uh i'm not saying we need him but uh i think sometimes they have to be there for a purpose uh and uh if the lord says uh that he's gonna be he's gonna get out of something good out of us through the afflictions he's gonna let that happen because the affliction can be direct for a consequence of something affliction can be judge a judgment from the lord or to purify us from something but you know the the the very first thing when uh we go through uh affliction uh we don't we don't wanna wait till someone even the pastor or someone comes and uh uh because for that situation there is a lot of people righteous people to come and judge you because they don't know what you're going through and maybe they're the the the step you're going through is something that is not difficult for them to to overcome and there's a lot of people remember joe was uh was a righteous man god even god called him perfect i think god was very proud of job and and uh he uh he had these troubles in life and his friends came and said hey you must be a secret sinner you must be doing this you must be because we are good to come up with some conclusions and that's that's the human nature and uh but uh i'm glad um that's not happening here uh affliction this is a part of a living and fallen world affliction there is a bunch of scriptures here that if if i go through them is we're gonna be out of here by five o'clock um but i just want you to to remember this that when when you have going when you going through something that you can't handle on your own we always have someone can take care of that and we the the problem is that we don't know how how to let go our problem that's that's the i think that's the main thing here that that we want help but we don't really want help god help me with this problem here but i i i don't want to let it go because you you you you think that you have to supervise the process and no it's not that way god says you want my help let it go let it go because we have to let go our eggo and our everything we sometimes is it's hard but you know we have to learn how to trust yes god's plans we don't we we don't know his plans but he knows why he plans for us and he knows what do we need because if he wants us to put in a position where we need to be ready for service he's going to put us through a lot of hardships and not in the bad way but he's going to make sure that we're ready for a task he has for us just imagine david he was a kid he was called uh his father gave him the the job to be a pastor of the ship the flock there and uh reading some stories i heard that being a pastor was the the lowest job you can get because even in uh when the the children of israel got to egypt being a pastor was a not good it was not high society they were smelly and it wasn't but he was called to do to be a pastor of those ships and and he didn't complain about it and what i'm saying this because he was playing his harp and he was having fun when you like something or you have fun doing it like i saw brother paul yesterday he was having fun painting but you know david had to go through that he didn't complain and and while he was pastoring those uh lamps then a bear came that's the first trial or the lion i don't know why i came first i don't remember but it was his first test he never killed he was never trained to be a a bear killer or a lion killer in his mind he had no clue how to kill it but he had to act upon what he had in his hands what do you have in your hands what the lord give you in your hands when we got a first trial we're gonna go run and hide or we're gonna face it with what we have on our hands that's what i'm trying to i'm trying to to project here that we're not alone it doesn't matter how harsh heart looks how hard it feels we're not alone and david david knew that somehow he was gonna kill that animal so he had to act upon what he had on his hands so he killed it and then the other animal came he killed it and you think uh he was thinking oh i'm gonna be ready because there will be a giant coming and i have to train more i have to train harder nope but but the lord had that plan for him and the thing is what is god wants you to have in in you you have the assurance that if there is something you can do it's going to be there for you and we have uh many situations in life where uh even the doctors can do anything then what can you do oh yeah often times uh think about the uh joe's situation and in uh i say laura i i just came thank you enough and even if i give you my life 100 to the to the ministry i i will not be able to pay you for that because there is grace that moves and there was his grace that was able to remove everything we were there and the last check up and and i told the doctor say when is the next checkup he says you don't need to come back but if you want you we can do it i say i do whatever you want if you think he needs it he says i don't think he needs it but let's let's see him again in two years but uh the moment the moment we we are let go amen amen that's the moment when he takes over amen i i told the lord i say lord him is yours if you want him to stay with me for more years praise the lord if you want to take it with you praise the lord it's not easy but we have to learn how to let go when to let it go writer says god doesn't afflict us or allow us to be afflicted for no reason he has wonderful purpose for all the all he does in us god is the great artist who produces the ultimate masterpieces sons and daughters in the likeness of his son jesus christ so he makes us every stroke of the masters brush every top of the sculptures chisel count do you think the piece of wood is having fun when the is carving in there i mean obviously it's a dead wood but it might hurt just put your finger and smash it i mean it's a process and how many times we've been singing to be like jesus we sing that out loud but when the first trial comes we don't want to be like him i i take that back you know but when we see him sitting on the on the throne we want to be like jesus right even john says lord can you let me sit right next to you but when he when he saw him going through those hardships where he was even peter was i think peter was the closest and he'd deny him because they ran away you know we have to face or raise alone even jesus said lord why does forsaken me but you know what forgive me for what i'm going to say but he was a working process too he had to prove himself that he was worth what he was sent for he had to face it alone because god god knew that he was able to do it and that's the reason he left him alone because we had to go in some areas we have to go alone but god has the confidence in you that you're gonna make it over there he never he never complained obviously as human he he he cried he sweat he he bled but you know what he wasn't complaining what i'm doing today is why we have to go through a process if you want to become a lawyer you have to go to school and pass all the tests you want to be an accountant you have to pass all the tests you want to be a christ-like you have to pass all the tests that's the way it is we we it doesn't matter how rich is your dad so he can pay you the certificate no it doesn't count you know there was a story that it was two kids in the school one was rich that was poor and and the poor was had to they were pursuing the to be an architect and then years went by and all of a sudden they encount encountered themselves in a construction area and the rich guy bought the title of an architect and the poor guy he didn't have enough money to finish the course to become an architect but he put himself into work so he learned the hard way per se and then when this guy the rich guy came to him and say hi architect without title and the poor guy say hi title without architect that doesn't work here we're gonna make it we're gonna make it the way he wants us to make it david didn't ask to be a king he never in his wildest dream he never wanted to be a king to begin with he was bullied by his brother because he was tiny little boy and i'm the youngest of nine i know how hard it is so uh uh it's just a challenge in life when you get to when you you you're thinking you're getting over something and then all of a sudden there is another bump on the road it's like a non-ending cycle right but you know what we we have the proof here we have the proof that every time that a child of god was in trouble god came out of his rescue affliction deliver us from pride paul said god gave him his grievous thorn to keep him from becoming consented because of the surpassing greatness of revelations he was smart scholarship guy i mean if you are that smart i mean anyone can be puffed up yeah oh oh so and so and this and i'm but you know what god knows how to work everything he knows when to bring it up and how to keep you down why because he design us he knows what we need when we need it afflictions make us sympathetic merciful and slower to judge that's what i was saying earlier if you're suffered the fury of depression you won't assume that others were are depressed are in sin if you've been grieved by rebellious teen you'll be quick to sympathize with other struggling parents they're going through the same thing so you have that in mind oh i went through that oh i had depression oh i had this i had that you know when i went to my son's appointment last time the doctor said i want you to sign this form i said what's that for she said oh because i need to talk to him alone and make sure he doesn't have any uh uh like remember what was that not only the pressing thoughts but if uh like uh killing himself you know suicidal thoughts yeah thank you i say no because he doesn't have time for that if i know i need help i know where to go but no he doesn't have that i said now is this has to be like or is willingly i say he's a must or is willingly think to sciences no it's will anything okay no you know every time you go to a doctor there is a chance that you're gonna if you didn't feel anything you're gonna come feeling that symptom out of there that's i mean i'm not joking sounds like a joke but i'm not joking because is the human mind and i always ask myself how many times you have heard by his tribes we are healed and that goes away this is this is what we have to fight with this stinky body you don't take a shower for two days and you don't understand yourself is that's part of the price that we have to live in we have to struggle like i said in the beginning since the day we're born we are have facing some challenges in life afflictions remind us of of the bravery of his of this life and make us long longing for heaven amen i mean this this this afflictions here is a way how god is gonna work that you don't get too comfy you know how many how many israelites didn't make it out of egypt because they got comfy in egypt they got so comfy that they got used to uh not only worshipped the idols but they got used to their food yes eating a lot of lamb and i don't know what else when they came when they came out of egypt they had to eat only mana oh how much i miss all these onions and radishes and the chicken and tacos maybe but you know what that's part of the the the plan of god so he sends us some afflictions or allow us to have some afflictions so we don't get too comfy because the moment we get comfortable here that's the moment we're losing the vision that we are pilgrims here because in heaven is our treasure or true treasure when things go as much or wish our hearts are too prone to say it's good to be here but you know what when you if we have the chance that brother brennan had the chance to see a little bit over the curtain of time i can guarantee you you don't want to come back here painting baseboards and farming and dealing with customers here and there i mean it's is this is what we the reason we are serving the lord because we want to get out of here we want to get out of here uh i don't know if i told you this uh how many here's no sister connie in try cities not many but sister honey connie had uh her husband died a few months ago he was a heavy person and uh he wasn't that old but because his weight i mean put him into hardship there and uh one day he fell and had really bad concussion and he never made it out he was almost okay and then one day sister connie or an evening she sister connie went see him and uh and he told her say you know what i saw myself walking again she said wow when i said last night i saw myself walking again and sister connie was like oh and how do you see yourself like you are right now or when you were young no when i was young you know what next morning he passed so i uh i always wonder what will be the process the transition between life and death that moment when you're you know on that fine line but then somehow and i don't know i'm correct on this forgive me if i'm not but something told me that in that moment the body or or the spirit let go the body so we know that the spirit has a higher calling than the body you know and and so when the spirit sees the other side he doesn't care anymore about this old body that isn't here so i thought i always thought these people might be suffering they might be hard for them to leave their relatives and then and then i heard brother uh branham saying about brother bassman he wasn't his bedtime and asked him when is the best day brother brown this is my best day of my life because we're moving to a different realm where there is no pain we're not worried about wrinkles we're not worried about uh a straight hair ladies buying a tool to getting some curlies or or vice versa you know we don't worry about that stuff right now what we have to worry is about what can it do for you sir i'm here to serve the lord how i'm going to serve the lord there it is so we have to in other words we have to be grateful for the afflictions because the afflictions are turning us into a better person not all of them are punishment nope and and like i said before maybe someone is going to come to you and say hey god is punishing you for because but you know what the important thing here is you you and god know that you're right with him that's holy cares afflictions are opportunities opportunities for christ to display his power in us how how he's going to prove he's still alive if he's not in his body he came and did his part now we have to do ours as long as we can handle things in our own strength we won't see god's power because we always rely on our abilities is when the burden gets too massive for us to he to bear that christ comes along and says hey let me take it down from you but we don't want to let it go still oh i i can handle i no you can't let him handle it for you how we're gonna do that i think the only way to do that is to recognizing that we're nothing with christ say lord i really need you here and reveals his universe sustaining sustaining strength but he's he said to me my grace is sufficient paul afflictions drive us to god's word how many how many experience that yeah so sometimes we we we we're so relaxed and we start forgetting about oh what is the bible where i left it last week but then it comes on affliction we know where to run this is right i might be preaching to myself here this is any we go to the oh where where does she go oh yeah that's right many are the afflictions of the righteous that's the moment when you ask yourself am i righteous afflictions prove the reality of god's grace in our lives how does how does someone endure years of sickness and yet continue to be joyful how does a wife lose her husband to cancer yet join the saints follow following sunday and leave her hands in worship what makes us makes her husband care for his anxiety wife and continue to love god god's amazing grace and due to afflictions is evidence we haven't believed somewhat some empty philosophy we believe something real we have hardships yeah he never call us to be safe and relax that's not the point afflictions makes us thankful when god deliver us from them call upon me the day of trouble i will deliver you and you shall glorify me psalms 50 15. afflictions produce unique fruit that doesn't grow in other soil we want to produce fruit right yes get ready because we we need afflictions for to get to the point where god says i'm proud of you and he he and if the enemy comes in challenging god about you he's not going to say wait a minute let me get him ready no he's preparing you not right now now it's up to us if we quit because god ain't gonna quit until you quit he knows we're a work in progress he didn't save us yesterday to become perfect today no it's a work in progress but as a natural life is telling us or teaching us that a baby is not baby all these years he grows so as a christian we have to grow to that's that's that's the reality we don't we don't we we're not gonna stay baby diapers all these years maybe one day we need him but not right now i mean is is it's just the natural life is teaching us how the spiritual life has got to be because i heard a lot of people how are you doing brothers oh you know i'm hanging in there yeah i always complain oh this and that and that what good you got out of the complaining all the time what is he helping you because i saw you last month and you say the same thing you i'm asking you today are you still saying the same thing that tells me that he hasn't had an experience with the lord that's it amen i'm not here throwing stones to anybody i i said it already i might be preaching to myself this morning but when when when we when we face a challenge first we have to know how how we are spiritually we have to judge yourself you don't need to wait to someone come judge you we have the way how to compare your life to and okay lord if i have any made any mistake please forgive me lord but as far as i can see as far as i can remember i think i'm right with you lord so that's that's that's the first step we have to do because afflictions are going to come god is not going to stop him for you we have to go through those because he's preparing us afflictions produce unique fruit that doesn't grow another kind of soil fruits like there you go faith patience perseverance gentleness lung suffering how are we going to produce those fruits it's not going to come just hand it to you like this no it's gonna come through suffering suffering afflictions manifest god's faithfulness and may mighty sustaining power for i am sure that neither death or life nor angels no rulers no things present nor things to come nor powers and our high power not depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god are we part of those plants of god i mean we we we were called each and every one of us being called to do something and until today i haven't found out yet but here i am trying to do my best finally afflictions make us like christ god's ultimate goal is to conform conform us to his son so that we can enjoy enjoy him forever so ultimately afflictions are for eternal joy and gladness in jesus christ i was just thinking about the life of jesus when he he was feeding all the people he was healing the people and all of a sudden when he started sharing his high revelation to the people how the people start walking away from him so in other words having a church full of people doesn't mean love the lord doesn't mean they're 100 committed to the lord and the only ones who who stay with him even in a hiding place from time to time but they will they're always willing to pursue the his uh teachings he came back to them so as long as we stay put on the post of duty he's gonna sometimes you don't see it but you know what he he never leave us he's going to be there for you in time of trouble he's going to be there for you god god never never does something without seeing the finished product so he never create a bunch of people with a without purpose because we're members of his body and every body has different members and each member has an importance an important play a role to play and and sometimes i ask that myself lord what i'm doing here what do you want me to do but uh i know those are thoughts from the enemy because as long as i can do the best whatever i have to do the best way i can do it is just to let god do his thing amen i i just i just can't imagine my life without christ i tried didn't work out i think i'll give you that testimony the other day here and and and like the song says why me lord this is mercy it's his mercy that you're here in this place today because there is so many people out there that had the chance to hear the good news but they just ignore it they just want to commit themselves to the lord not to you not the pastor because many of them nowadays and thanks to those televangelistic programs every time you go to to talk about the lord someone said no because they you want me to help you to uh feed the pastor oh you want me to help you to get a new card to the pastor that's not a thing you know i i i met pastors in mexico they they didn't have a donkey and they were happy pastors because when that's that's a pastor because many can call themselves pastors because a good pastor shepherd he's not expecting anything out of the he is expecting from the lord he's doing the job for the lord now he's not working for you he's working for the lord so i think i think i said enough today but i want to say one more thing here that when when you when you come in in a position where you question yourself about should i quit just go back to the scriptures oh wait a minute satan you're talking to me now but you know what the bible says many are the afflictions but god is gonna deliver me and i know i'm gonna have more after this but i know god is gonna deliver me so i uh i would like i would like you to go out of this building today the way many people come out of the doctor's appointment the doctor said oh you have this headache you have that backache and then you're coming out of the dog why are you where you walking oh the doctor says i have a bad back okay you know the bible says we're gonna have tribulations yeah but guess what he already he paid the biggest price well we're gonna have to pay i think is meaningless we we we're there is no way we can match that i think we have a bargain right we just take what we have and give to the rest of the people we receive uh a freely gift salvation is free we're saved by grace not about works so he paid the price so you and i can be saved but now you pay the price to take the salvation you have to someone else and sometimes that is not going to be an easy task but hey we have a good good very very good uh example that he made it through the hardships he bled he sweat with blood a lot of tears a lot of agony so you and i can be free amen just just think about just think about uh the brother the story but brother martin said that this uh caller man was looking at abraham's lincoln's clothing he saw some blood stains in there and he was crying just because what that man did just imagine what jesus did for you and i and it was abraham lincoln just paying the price for the just to get him out of the slavery here but jesus christ paid the price so we can get out of the sinful life and go to spend the rest so we can have life just to be just to close with this a pastor was a interview with the news lady and this lady told the pastor to say pastor i've been hanging around with a lot of people that they're skeptic people and unbelievers and they just don't believe that there is a life after death and uh and she said let's pretend i don't believe in nothing let's pretend i don't know nothing and you come to me trying to preaching to me a life after death how how would you come up to me with such thing like that and this this is a very very calm baptist uh i think it's a adventist pastor very very calm he has seems to have nice spirit he's brazilian and he said let's pretend uh you and i get to the end of the road and you die i die and there is no heaven there is no god there is nothing else what did i lose i lose nothing but let's turn in the other way if i preach to you there's a heaven there is a god that is of life after this when you die and i die and if it is real what did you lose everything yeah you know what she said she shake her head and go like brother and sister it's no brainer because this building didn't build by itself it had to be a builder the bible says that god created heavens and earth in the beginning he created them all and an english version says that the the the earth was void right but the spanish version says was messy that's what the spanish version says and the earth was a mess and because god wasn't in this arab before god was up there so he created the heavens and earth and because god was coming down it was a mess and when you and i without christ we are a mess that's the truth amen i don't know if you get musicians can come please thank you for your time i don't know how much i time i took of your but you know i just prayed lord that it can be a little bit of help somewhere uh appreciate that every time i come here it feels good and uh and trust me i visited a lot of churches when i was in colorado when many churches and it's hard to find a church when you can feel the spirit of the lord amen you can feel a lot of spirits not the spirit of the lord brother jason you're my help in this time of trouble here thank god i am i am free [Music] nice to see you brother isaac [Music] thank you free [Music] been washing the blood of jesus i've been born again hallelujah so i'm safe eyes
