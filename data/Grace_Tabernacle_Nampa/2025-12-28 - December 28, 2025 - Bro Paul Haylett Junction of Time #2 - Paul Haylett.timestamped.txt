[5:21] And I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[5:25] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[5:30] abides with me.
[5:34] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[5:38] had no peace within till I heard how
[5:42] Jesus died upon the tree.
[5:47] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[5:51] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter

[6:17] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[6:22] with me.
[6:25] And he is with me everywhere.

[6:33] as a bird. and just as free
[6:38] for the spirit has control. Jesus

[7:08] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[7:13] with me.
[7:16] Well, there's no thirsting for the
[7:18] things of the world. They've taken
[7:21] wings. Long ago I gave them up and
[7:26] instantly.
[7:29] All my night was turned to day. All my
[7:33] burdens rolled away. Now the comforter
[7:38] abides with me.
[7:42] He abides.
[7:45] He abides.
[7:48] Hallelujah.
[7:50] He abides with me
[7:56] night and day as I walk the narrow way.

[12:13] Remember, for a complete healing and
[12:16] those who are traveling, the Grahams
[12:18] family, um the whites, um and who else
[12:21] was it?
[12:23] Yeah. Well, just pray for these needs
[12:26] and then we'll have brother Isaac come
[12:27] up and share something with us. Uh
[12:29] brother David, would you mind leading us
[12:31] in a word of prayer this morning?
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you.
[12:41] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Lord, we
[12:43] bow our heads before thee, the king of
[12:48] who has never failed to be where two or
[12:50] three are gathered together. There am I
[12:52] in their midst. Lord, we are so thankful
[12:56] for the word that's made power in us.
[12:59] But that's the power you said would be
[13:01] in your bride. The power to manifest
[13:04] your word, the power to express life, to
[13:06] give life, to impart life. Lord, that's
[13:10] the reason we're here to manifest your
[13:12] word and for this hour and this season,
[13:15] this great event that is upon us, Lord,
[13:17] and taking place to bring us to a body
[13:20] change. We lift up these that are in
[13:24] need, Lord. Our brother and sister White
[13:26] traveling and sister April, Lord, and
[13:29] her need and where she is. And Lord, be
[13:32] with them and be others that are
[13:34] traveling, others, Lord, not well, be in
[13:36] their midst. So God, we know that you're
[13:39] present. We know that you're here to
[13:41] reveal and open your word to those that
[13:43] have an ear to hear what the spirit is
[13:45] saying in this hour. We're expecting it,
[13:48] Lord. And we give you praise now for
[13:50] answering these requests and all others,
[13:52] even unspoken requests in our midst. May
[13:55] you fulfill your purpose and perfect
[13:57] will in our lives. And let us line up
[13:59] with the word and lay our veil upon your
[14:02] shoulders, trusting, relying upon you.
[14:04] For you said that you would keep those
[14:07] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed
[14:09] upon thee because we trust thee. Now we
[14:12] give you thanks for answering prayer. In
[14:15] Jesus Christ's name we pray and say
[14:17] thank you Lord. We give you thanks.
[14:20] Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated with Isaac. Make
[14:25] your way up here.
[14:27] Um and then we'll have a special posture
[14:29] if you want to come up after this.
[14:36] God bless you this morning, man. Thanks
[14:39] for your prayers. We had a had a nasty
[14:41] snowstorm on the way home yesterday, but
[14:43] we wanted to make it back. So, we plowed
[14:46] on. I don't get that nervous driving,
[14:48] but I was a little nervous driving
[14:50] yesterday.
[14:52] But, uh, God is gracious. Amen. Um, just
[14:55] wanted to give a report. We um gave some
[14:57] money to a brother uh down in uh he's
[14:59] from
[15:01] I have El Salvador stuck in my head, but
[15:02] it's Nicaragua. Brother Ezekiel.
[15:05] Um he had been invited to some meetings
[15:08] they were having. So he's he's traveled
[15:10] I think since we we talked to him. Um so
[15:14] he's he's has translated for my dad
[15:16] several times. Um and he's he's a
[15:20] minister as well um um for the for the
[15:23] local assembly there that he attends
[15:25] there in Nicaragua. And um he had been
[15:29] invited to some meetings to preach some
[15:31] meetings in El Salvador and uh and Costa
[15:34] Rica if I remember right and um was
[15:38] unable didn't have the money to make it.
[15:40] Um the tickets there can be kind of
[15:43] spendy for the but he always likes to
[15:44] travel with his wife as well. we kind of
[15:46] heard about this and um I reached out to
[15:49] him and brother Paul and um contacted
[15:53] him to find out what uh what what the
[15:55] need was and we uh were able to send him
[15:59] some money. There's got a picture of him
[16:00] and his wife. Probably rotate that
[16:04] them on the plane. If you turn your head
[16:06] sideways, you can see it right.
[16:08] I I had a couple more on my phone, but I
[16:10] didn't get them all sent in time. I kind
[16:12] of did it at the last minute there. Um
[16:14] but he was able to preach um those
[16:16] meetings and and travel to several other
[16:18] little uh groups there throughout El
[16:19] Salvador and uh in Costa Rica there.
[16:22] There's some of the the uh
[16:25] some of one of one of the churches he
[16:27] was able to visit, but he reported back
[16:29] and said they they had a wonderful time.
[16:31] Um and just wanted to share that that we
[16:34] were able to support him in doing that
[16:35] and in going out and preaching the
[16:36] gospel. Amen. And I think that's very
[16:38] important, you know, and uh you know,
[16:42] desire in my heart is that souls would
[16:43] be saved. Amen.
[16:46] Uh I think that's the only two I got on
[16:48] there. I had got the other two in the
[16:51] email. If you want to see them, I got
[16:52] them on my phone, but uh you know, they
[16:54] sent them to me in WhatsApp and I didn't
[16:56] uh I didn't get get to it till till this
[16:59] morning, the last minute. So, God bless
[17:01] you. Thank you for giving and being able
[17:03] to support um you know, missionaries and
[17:06] and these things. Amen. Said our our our
[17:09] desire would be that the last one would
[17:11] come in. Amen.

[27:37] Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.
[27:43] Bring them in.
[27:47] Bring them in.

[27:56] "Bring them in.
[27:59] Bring them in.
[28:02] Bring the little ones to Jesus."
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a wonderful privilege
[28:12] that we have today to be here to
[28:17] um dedicate
[28:20] such a wonderful, wonderful little boy.
[28:24] Um I've just had a wonderful time there
[28:29] at the house just uh getting to
[28:33] play with him. I've even got down on the
[28:36] floor and rolled around on the floor
[28:38] with him a little bit. And uh so today
[28:43] we want to dedicate little Isaac
[28:45] William. And Isaac and this so fits this
[28:49] young man. Isaac means he will laugh or
[28:53] one who laughs and rejoices. Amen. And
[28:56] that fits this little guy perfectly.
[29:00] William is a resolute or determined
[29:03] protector,
[29:05] strong willed warrior. We'll pray for
[29:08] you on that part. Amen. But uh anyway,
[29:12] just such a a real privilege uh brother
[29:15] Pashant, sister Koncha,
[29:18] um the miles may separate us, but our
[29:20] hearts are knit uh as one with you. And
[29:25] um we thank the Lord for the fellowship,
[29:28] the friendship,
[29:30] um to share prayers and
[29:34] these wonderful milestones.
[29:37] How many days that you have prayed for a
[29:40] baby
[29:42] and here we are.
[29:45] My how precious. And just just makes my
[29:49] heart melt to see this wonderful little
[29:52] guy. Amen. You think he'll let me hold
[29:55] him? I think he will.
[29:59] Say hi to everyone. You know, Brother
[30:01] Brandham did that once. He took the baby
[30:03] and made him wave to everybody.
[30:07] Okay, let's dedicate him. Heavenly
[30:09] Father, Lord, as we stand before you
[30:12] this morning, we're holding this love
[30:14] gift, a blessing, Father, that you
[30:17] poured right out of heaven into the life
[30:20] of my brother Persant and sister Konsha.
[30:24] And Father, this little guy, Isaac
[30:26] William, Lord, we're just asking you,
[30:29] Father, just to seal him. Lord, we know
[30:32] that the days that would come might be
[30:36] dark and harrowing, Father. But Lord,
[30:39] with your hand upon his life, Father, he
[30:42] can live all the days. As King David
[30:45] said, that I may dwell in the house of
[30:47] the Lord forever. We're asking, Lord,
[30:50] for your hand of mercy, protection,
[30:53] leadership upon Isaac, Father. Lord, as
[30:57] you would just bring him, Father,
[30:59] however long, Lord, that you Terry, may
[31:02] he just be, Father, there as a young man
[31:06] growing up in the house of God. I think
[31:08] of that. I think of Samuel, Lord, how he
[31:12] was committed, Father, and was there in
[31:14] the house of God. And may you just touch
[31:17] little Isaac's life, Father, and let him
[31:20] be committed to you, Lord. Bless him.
[31:22] Give him strength. Give him health,
[31:24] Father. Lord, give him wisdom. Lord, we
[31:27] thank you for this for the family.
[31:30] Father, brother Persant, Sister Aona.
[31:33] Lord, that they would have wisdom to to
[31:36] raise him, Lord, to nurture him in the
[31:39] things of your word, Lord, that he would
[31:42] know, Father, what it was to dwell in
[31:45] your presence. We ask these blessings
[31:48] now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[31:53] Amen. Isn't he handsome little guy? Yes.
[31:58] Yeah. Smile.
[32:02] Not now. The reason I do that is cuz at
[32:05] the house I many times I'm like, "Okay,
[32:07] now smile." And it's like almost on
[32:09] command, you know? Just smile. And he
[32:11] smiles. Oh, God bless you. Amen. Yeah.
[32:16] Sister God. God bless you.
[32:19] Amen.
[32:25] Don't want anybody to think that we
[32:29] that we were captivating their time, but
[32:32] it certainly has been a blessing to have
[32:34] brother Pashant and sister Koncha in the
[32:36] house with us. Amen. So, I just want to
[32:40] make a couple announcements here. So,
[32:43] this coming Wednesday will be New Year's
[32:46] Eve and um I want us to just go ahead
[32:50] and have a service and uh what we'll
[32:54] focus on
[32:56] will be songs, worship, some testimony.
[33:00] Um if you have special songs, we would
[33:04] sure appreciate that. Uh some
[33:06] testimonies maybe to share what the Lord
[33:08] has done for you. Uh and uh I don't
[33:11] believe any one of us here today would
[33:14] be able to say the Lord hasn't done
[33:16] something significant in our life. Amen.
[33:20] Salvation is probably the not probably
[33:24] is the milestone
[33:26] of every individual's life being filled
[33:28] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. There we come
[33:31] into a milestone of what God is doing
[33:34] for us. And so um if you just Wednesday
[33:37] night just uh same time 7:30 and then we
[33:41] will have light meal finger food or
[33:44] something in the basement uh just
[33:46] afterwards a little time of fellowship
[33:49] and uh so we look forward to that. I
[33:51] believe it'll be a wonderful time. Uh,
[33:54] brother Jose Hernandez will be speaking
[33:56] for us next weekend and um I had invited
[34:01] him um oh back quite a few weeks ago and
[34:07] uh this is a time that works for him and
[34:10] uh I believe it will work for us just
[34:12] fine. Amen. So we've talked about the
[34:15] missions, we've talked about those that
[34:17] are away on holiday. remember our sister
[34:19] Rachel in prayer. Just uh it is imminent
[34:22] to have another uh beautiful baby here
[34:26] in the church. Amen. Just so looking
[34:29] forward to that. Uh and u may the Lord
[34:33] just protect uh mom and baby and uh look
[34:37] forward to uh having them in our midst.
[34:41] Amen. Is it good to be in the house of
[34:43] the Lord today?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak to you once again.
[34:47] Thank you so much our musicians. And I
[34:49] want to speak to you this morning on the
[34:52] title of a junction of time part two. Um
[34:57] if you
[34:59] if you get a chance, it's a it's a
[35:02] lovely sermon that brother Brham taught
[35:05] uh preached there for us. It is uh just
[35:08] incredibly uh inspiring to me uh because
[35:12] he comes down and he brings all these
[35:15] events that took place in scripture
[35:18] through the years and he shows us how
[35:20] those were a junction in time. And so
[35:24] when we're looking at each one of these,
[35:26] we we'll see that Noah uh there was a
[35:30] junction in time, a coming together, God
[35:33] proving his word. He's proving he's not
[35:36] a god of history. He's a god very
[35:39] present. Amen. So, we don't want to look
[35:41] at him as though he's a historical god
[35:44] even though he was there in history. But
[35:47] he is here today. Amen. And so, I just
[35:51] uh been uh studying that and u uh also
[35:55] on the attraction. What is the
[35:56] attraction on the mountain? Uh just been
[35:59] stirring my heart. Let's turn in our
[36:01] Bibles if we would to First Peter the 2
[36:04] chapter verses 1-10.
[36:06] Amen. I enjoyed that special. Um
[36:13] that was that was good. Thank you.
[36:16] Amen.
[36:18] First Peter 2 chapter verses 1-10.
[36:23] Now, we could take as a side note that
[36:27] what our real goal here is to make a
[36:29] rapture, right? We're we're not here to
[36:32] to put on some cloak of righteousness
[36:35] like a Pharisee or Sadducee. Uh we don't
[36:38] put on stripes as it were on the sleeve
[36:42] as it would be in the military to show
[36:44] how long you've been in the service.
[36:46] None of that matters. What matters is
[36:49] that when he calls, we're ready. Amen.
[36:53] That's what matters. Amen. And so, I
[36:56] just love this scripture. Wherefore,
[36:58] laying aside all malice and all guile
[37:01] and hypocrisies and envys and all evil
[37:04] speakings, as newborn babes, desire the
[37:08] sincere milk of the word, that ye may
[37:11] grow thereby. If so be ye have tasted
[37:15] that the Lord is gracious to whom coming
[37:18] as unto a living stone, disallowed
[37:21] indeed of men, but chosen of God and
[37:25] precious. Ye also as lively stones are
[37:28] built up a spiritual house, a holy
[37:31] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[37:33] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[37:37] Christ. Wherefore also it is contained
[37:41] in the scripture, behold, I lay in sign
[37:44] a chief cornerstone, elect, precious,
[37:47] and he that believeth on him shall not
[37:50] be confounded.
[37:52] Unto you therefore, which believe, he is
[37:54] precious. Can we say amen to that? Amen.
[37:58] But unto them which be disobedient, the
[38:00] stone which the builders disallowed, the
[38:03] same is made the head of the corner, and
[38:06] a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
[38:09] offense, even to them which stumble at
[38:12] the word, being disobedient, where unto
[38:15] also they were appointed. Now verse
[38:18] eight is very stunning, my brother and
[38:20] sister, for us. We we really should
[38:23] embrace and understand what we were
[38:26] appointed to. Yes.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture so clearly says that
[38:31] that uh they were a stone, a stumbling
[38:33] rock of offense to them that stumble at
[38:35] the word, being disobedient.
[38:38] They were appointed to that.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; But we weren't appointed to that. We
[38:43] were appointed to be believers of the
[38:46] word of God.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can never overstate that
[38:51] too much. Amen. It it we maybe can get
[38:55] redundant. It can come to a point that
[38:57] it seems like it's just words, but my
[39:00] brother and sister, it's not just words.
[39:03] There's life in those words. Amen.
[39:06] There's life in that anointing. The
[39:08] power of God is coming down in full
[39:11] measure in this hour. Now, we'll get
[39:15] into this a little further here to
[39:17] understand what that full measure might
[39:20] have as an example. Amen. But ye are a
[39:24] chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
[39:27] holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye
[39:32] should show forth the praises of him who
[39:35] hath called you out of darkness unto his
[39:38] marvelous light, which in time past were
[39:41] not a people, but are now the people of
[39:44] God, which had not obtained mercy, but
[39:47] now have obtained mercy. Amen. And it's
[39:51] in this junction of time. If if you'll
[39:54] listen to that sermon, you'll see how
[39:56] this scripture fits. Because all through
[39:58] that time in uh Noah's day, there was
[40:02] only one man that God saw as righteous
[40:06] enough to bring that word through.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; And we see with Moses, there was one man
[40:11] at that moment of time that God says,
[40:14] "This is the man that I can bring the
[40:16] word through." and right on through the
[40:18] ages. And we're coming right down into
[40:20] this age. Now, bear with me here. We're
[40:23] in this age. And there was one man that
[40:26] God chose, right? There wasn't a dozen
[40:28] that he brought. Or am I wrong?
[40:35] See, this is where some people get a
[40:37] little upset or confused.
[40:40] God brought the word to one man, but
[40:43] that word was given to the bride,
[40:47] &gt;&gt; and she is the voice now.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; She's the voice right now.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; See, so while the word was prophetically
[40:57] given to one man, it was disseminated
[41:01] out into a whole group of people that we
[41:04] could fulfill the word and the spirit
[41:06] and the bride say, "Come." Now, we can
[41:09] take uh Joshua and Caleb. And Caleb, you
[41:13] know, we've typed it this way before,
[41:15] even though he had a more powerful
[41:17] position than that. But, you know,
[41:18] Caleb's ministry could have been just
[41:20] following along behind Joshua and and
[41:23] saying what he just said, that's the
[41:25] truth.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Uh hear what he just said here. Mark
[41:29] this down what he just said. But God
[41:32] gave Caleb more than that.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; He gave us more than that. Yeah.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can now raise our voice
[41:41] and we can speak, we can bind, we can
[41:44] loose,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; we can deliver. You say, "Oh, oh, that's
[41:48] not given for us." Yes, it is.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; It is given for us. Amen. So, we do not
[41:53] want to be the limitation
[41:56] &gt;&gt; in this hour. Amen. Heavenly Father,
[42:00] Lord, we thank you, Lord, your grace and
[42:03] mercy. Lord, we would just ask you,
[42:06] Father, if you would just come this
[42:07] morning, speak to each and every heart.
[42:10] Father, encourage us today, Lord.
[42:13] Strengthen us. And certainly, Father,
[42:15] from our daytoday life, Lord, as hard as
[42:19] we seem to try sometimes, Lord, we have
[42:22] shortcomings. Forgive us of those
[42:24] shortcomings. For Father, we're here,
[42:27] Lord, to come, Lord, and be partakers.
[42:32] Not observers, not just a witness, but
[42:35] partakers. Speak to our hearts today, I
[42:39] pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[42:42] You may be seated. Amen.
[42:56] So as we'll look at this verse 9, it
[42:59] says a chosen generation and we will
[43:02] understand my brother and sister that
[43:04] God knows his own. Isn't that wonderful
[43:06] that God knows exactly who's his now
[43:09] people misunderstand they say well if
[43:11] predestination that means that you
[43:13] didn't even have a choice. No
[43:15] predestination is God knowing the choice
[43:17] you would make. And so it's wonderful
[43:19] that God looking down in our life said,
[43:21] "I know who you are. I know my own. And
[43:25] I know that you will serve me. You will
[43:27] have hard times. You'll have trials.
[43:30] You'll have struggles. But at the end,
[43:32] you will decide, I have to serve God."
[43:35] Now, we'll have a quote here. I don't
[43:36] want to get ahead of myself. A quote
[43:38] here in a little bit that I think goes
[43:40] along with that very, very well. Now, my
[43:43] brother and sister, I want us to not get
[43:45] so used to hearing uh you're a chosen
[43:48] generation that we become desensitized
[43:50] to the reality of what that really
[43:52] means. Amen. Every time that a son or a
[43:56] daughter gets converted, Amen. gets
[43:58] saved, uh gets the Holy Ghost, um it
[44:02] it's just the start of the battle. Many
[44:05] times it's been pre presented that that
[44:08] would that would just get that and
[44:09] you've got it made. Well, I would agree
[44:11] with that. But you're going to find a
[44:13] lot a lot of battle, a lot of wounds, a
[44:16] lot of struggle, uh a lot of time, uh
[44:19] and and u you know, we're living in the
[44:21] age that the battle is in the mind. And
[44:24] so there'll be a lot of mind battles
[44:25] that we'll have to face besides the
[44:28] physical outside, but we'll be in this
[44:31] time. And but if we're not careful, we
[44:34] can come to a place that we hear this
[44:35] that we're a chosen generation so much
[44:38] that we just kind of feel like that that
[44:41] um we just got it made. It's it's done.
[44:44] And in one sense, that's right. Right.
[44:45] When you were sealed or called of God,
[44:48] he's not going to lose a one. So you
[44:50] don't have to worry about that part. But
[44:53] that wasn't a call for us to lay down
[44:55] and be lazy Christians. Amen. That
[44:58] actually is a call for us to rise up and
[45:01] to put oursel ready for the battle to
[45:04] put ourselves ready for the fullness of
[45:06] the word. Amen. Now, brother Brennham
[45:09] says here in the junction of time, he
[45:11] says here, I think this church ought to
[45:14] know truth and the sign where we're at
[45:18] that you won't be slothful,
[45:21] that you'll be up and doing, that the
[45:24] differences will be settled. Now I want
[45:27] to stop for just a moment and focus on
[45:29] that my brother and sister because
[45:31] people are saying well we're still
[45:33] looking for this moment of this time
[45:35] when there'll be unity comes in the
[45:37] bride of Jesus Christ. Well that unity
[45:40] my brother and sister is going to bring
[45:42] us or anoint us that we will settle our
[45:45] differences. This is not to see who has
[45:48] the best u black blackening uh uh
[45:52] ability, you know, to make someone look
[45:54] bad, but to literally come and settle
[45:57] our differences. And in that, we don't
[46:00] always see things the same. Amen. So,
[46:02] every one of us would come and we have a
[46:05] different perspective. We have a
[46:07] different idea about how things are. But
[46:09] as long as we can take it back to the
[46:11] word and we're not so rigidly fixed on
[46:15] our idea, then the Lord can shift us. He
[46:18] can lead us and guide us and show us
[46:21] where he wants us to go. Now, if you
[46:23] won't be moved, he can't take you there.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be willing to surrender
[46:29] ourself to go there and allow God to
[46:32] lead us and take us into further truth.
[46:34] Right? He said, "I'll lead you and guide
[46:36] you into all truth." Amen. You can't put
[46:39] the anchor down. You can't stomp on the
[46:41] emergency brake. You can't sit there and
[46:43] say, "I won't be moved." You have to be
[46:46] pliable. You have to let God move you.
[46:48] And sometimes the moving that God wants
[46:50] to do is he wants us to come to a place
[46:54] that we would be humbled enough. Amen.
[46:57] Now, I know that some of us are right
[46:59] more often than others.
[47:04] Well, I got a reaction out of some of
[47:06] you.
[47:08] My brother and sister, we have to come
[47:10] to the place that we're willing to say,
[47:12] I wasn't right.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the answer. I didn't know
[47:17] what I thought I knew. And we have to be
[47:21] able to do that. The the moving of the
[47:23] spirit. I I won't go into it but I I I
[47:26] shared this with brother Pavle a
[47:28] experience in in South America one time
[47:30] where I just thought a service was a
[47:32] disaster and have a deacon come and say
[47:35] we need you brother Paul and go and most
[47:38] of the church is in the altar. Now my
[47:40] brother and sister, you see what God was
[47:42] doing to Paul in that time, he was
[47:45] actually humbling at Paul and changing
[47:47] Paul's opinion or Paul's mind because
[47:50] what I thought was a disaster of a
[47:52] service only took one moment of the Holy
[47:55] Spirit moving down through that church.
[47:58] It wasn't about Paul.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; It never was about Paul. Paul didn't
[48:03] make it happen. Paul didn't He could
[48:05] stop it from happening, but he didn't
[48:07] make it happen. And we'll touch on
[48:09] another quote here in a minute just to
[48:11] reinforce that. But you see, sometimes
[48:13] God lets us go into hard times and
[48:17] struggles so that we'll learn a lesson
[48:19] and not forget it.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; How many lessons have we learned and
[48:23] then forgotten? But God wants his bride
[48:26] to learn the lessons that are going to
[48:29] deliver her into her rightful place in
[48:32] eternity. And he wants her to never
[48:35] forget that lesson. He wants her to come
[48:38] and understand what it is because you
[48:41] see what it is.
[48:44] I don't know how to put it any other
[48:46] way. Uh it sounds a little I don't know
[48:49] what a good wife.
[48:55] Now, I'm not saying there isn't any good
[48:57] wife here. Now, don't misunderstand me.
[49:00] But a good wife actually wants to please
[49:03] her husband.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:06] And it's not a one-way street. A good
[49:08] husband actually wants to please his
[49:10] wife. So, we have to in marriage, isn't
[49:14] this amazing how you can have two people
[49:17] uh raised uh you know, maybe hundreds if
[49:20] not thousands of miles apart and they
[49:23] get this crazy notion that they're in
[49:25] love
[49:27] and and and they just think, "I can't
[49:29] live without this young man. I can't
[49:31] live without this young lady. and and I
[49:34] I've got to have her in my life. And
[49:36] they say, "I do." And they do the
[49:38] honeymoon and they settle into life
[49:43] and
[49:45] they have to start wearing the edges off
[49:47] of each other
[49:50] because you can't take two people raised
[49:53] in entirely different worlds,
[49:56] different ideas.
[49:58] You see what God's doing to us?
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He took us out for us here. He
[50:04] took us out of Leodysia. We as the bride
[50:08] were were brought up in an entirely
[50:10] different atmosphere than glory.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the atmosphere around the
[50:17] throne. We we have been raised up in
[50:20] this very very carnal, very
[50:23] self-centered. Uh you can find all the
[50:26] rest of the words. and and it's in that
[50:28] realm that that we have to start uh
[50:31] interacting and and we we come up with
[50:33] things like I think God would want it
[50:35] this way. We never even ask him. We
[50:38] don't know what he wants, but we're
[50:40] assuming because we're the bride. Amen.
[50:44] But when he says, this is why I took it
[50:47] the way I did the a good wife starting
[50:49] off because when he says he doesn't have
[50:52] a second option.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. He doesn't come along and
[50:56] say, "I think this will be good for my
[50:59] bride. Oh, I guess it didn't turn out
[51:01] like I thought." No, he knows what's
[51:04] good for you and I. He knows what's
[51:07] going to get us through this challenge
[51:09] of this world that we live in right now.
[51:13] But we are boxed in. And the only thing
[51:15] we know is a carnal human that has come
[51:19] into the presence of Almighty God. and
[51:22] the word is working mightily in you. Can
[51:24] we say amen to that this morning? This
[51:27] is not a feeble gospel. This is not a
[51:30] secondhand gospel. This is not a word
[51:33] that just hopes that it will work. This
[51:36] is a word that God says, "I'll hang
[51:38] heaven and earth upon my word, and it
[51:41] will only be my word that will not pass
[51:43] away."
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not looking here now at
[51:47] some gospel that we hope will work. We
[51:50] need to recognize that our husband has
[51:53] provided for us something that has such
[51:56] intrinsic value so powerful that we can
[52:00] place our very life on that and trust
[52:03] him.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; But look how hard it is for us sometimes
[52:06] to trust. Amen.
[52:10] Let me go back to my quote here. And I
[52:12] think this church, and I'm speaking to
[52:14] grace this morning, I think this church
[52:17] ought to know truth and the sign of
[52:19] where we're at, that you won't be
[52:21] slothful, that you won't be that you'll
[52:24] be up and doing, that the differences
[52:27] will be settled. Come on, saints.
[52:29] Whether it's husband or wife, brother or
[52:32] sister, we need to settle our
[52:33] differences. We're Christians. We're the
[52:36] bride of Christ. We're not We're not
[52:39] Pardon me. When when my daughter Kristen
[52:41] got married, they almost didn't allow
[52:43] her uh to have her wedding at the church
[52:45] that she had it at because the wedding
[52:48] previous to that, the two fathers got in
[52:52] a brawl in the parking lot.
[52:55] We're not those kind of people. We're
[52:58] sons and daughters of God. We're not
[53:00] We're not called to take our petty
[53:02] differences and our attitudes and and
[53:04] the influence of Leodysia. We're called
[53:07] We've got a throne. Amen. And if I can
[53:09] put it in this stereotype here. Amen.
[53:12] We've got the great car wash of the word
[53:15] that we're supposed to be going through.
[53:17] And it's going to wash us whiter than
[53:19] snow. And the only reason that we have
[53:21] these blotches is cuz we're not going
[53:24] through the washing of the word. See,
[53:27] we're supposed to be doing that. And God
[53:29] wants us to do that. And something in
[53:31] our heart wants us to do that. Something
[53:34] inside of us. Amen. That the differences
[53:37] be settled. and you'll walk like real
[53:40] godly men and women. Your heart set on
[53:43] Christ.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; My imagine if we now come to this place
[53:48] that our real focus is uh not on one
[53:52] another.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; It's on Christ.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I shared
[53:59] that little deal that I found and it's
[54:02] on my phone,
[54:04] um was reading my Bible and I found many
[54:09] heirs
[54:12] in me.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; See, there's where it's at, saints.
[54:16] We're not going to find it in the word.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; The word is pure. It's powerful. It's
[54:21] perfect.
[54:22] But we're going to and when we read the
[54:24] Bible, we're going to find heirs. But
[54:27] we're going to find them. They're in us.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants us to do.
[54:31] Because it really takes a real Christian
[54:34] to be able to be cut to the very marrow
[54:37] of our bone and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[54:41] &gt;&gt; If there's any carnal life left in us,
[54:44] when the word cuts us to the marrow of
[54:46] the bone, we push back. That's the
[54:49] preacher's opinion. That's brother
[54:51] Brandham's opinion. That's this man's
[54:54] opinion and that man's opinion. But when
[54:57] you have a real experience with God and
[54:59] the word cuts you right down to the
[55:01] marrow of your bone, you say, "Lord,
[55:04] help me.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. I want to I want to be
[55:07] what this word says I'm supposed to be.
[55:10] I want the very life that's in these
[55:12] words to be living in me."
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, and it's not a insult or you're not
[55:20] defaming yourself to actually admit
[55:23] &gt;&gt; that God still needs to work on you.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We don't have to. It's not
[55:29] demeaning to say, "Oh, I guess I would
[55:31] sound like I'm not a very good
[55:32] Christian. I sound like I'm weak or I
[55:34] sound like I still have things in my
[55:36] life." No, my brother and sister, the
[55:38] scripture says that confession's good.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, why don't we just be bold
[55:44] enough to confess that I I still need
[55:46] the Lord. I need the word to work on me.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'm pushing into that.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Does it sometimes make us look like we
[55:56] are coming short? Yeah, it does. But I
[56:00] would rather see it and be able to
[56:04] correct it
[56:06] &gt;&gt; than to be blinded.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And never correct it. That's right.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; The correction, the scripture says
[56:15] correction's good.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; The love of God, a good father
[56:22] &gt;&gt; corrects his child.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as we look at this, see, we
[56:28] really need to be careful
[56:31] that we don't create our own truth.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Now,
[56:38] if we
[56:41] study,
[56:42] we pray, we read our Bible,
[56:47] and
[56:50] we can create our own
[56:52] truth, you might say. Now, I'm going to
[56:55] put it out like this here for an
[56:57] example. Our own truth might be that we
[57:02] think every sister should dress
[57:06] like we make our wife dress.
[57:11] Was that straightforward enough or
[57:12] should I ramp it up a little more?
[57:20] Met men before now it's their
[57:22] preference. It's their wife. But I've
[57:24] met men before that complained to me as
[57:27] a fellow minister that he didn't like
[57:30] these sisters that curl their hair all
[57:32] curly.
[57:34] Okay.
[57:37] Oh my.
[57:39] Let's all focus on Sister Ruth.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I know that's my I'm going to use you
[57:45] for an example.
[57:48] If I don't know Sister Ruth, I would be
[57:50] thinking that she spent all morning with
[57:52] one of those things going crimp, crimp,
[57:54] crimp, crimp.
[57:57] So people get ideas that become their
[58:00] own reality.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And they judge everything by their
[58:06] reality.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And so in that, how can you really truly
[58:13] love someone you're judging? Right?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Because if you really love them and you
[58:18] thought they were wrong, you would call
[58:21] them out in church.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; No,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; you would pray for them.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Prophet gave us a very clear example.
[58:30] You pray for them.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for not being offended,
[58:34] Sister Ruth.
[58:36] But it was a perfect example.
[58:40] So you see my brother and sister, we can
[58:43] have our own version of what we think
[58:44] the word means.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:49] They sang this special this morning, the
[58:52] opening of the seals, what it meant.
[58:55] Now,
[58:57] people that believe this message would
[59:00] be offended at that song.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just going to be straight
[59:05] forward with you. There'd be people that
[59:06] would be offended at that song.
[59:09] that there's no way we could understand,
[59:12] we could have no real revelation that
[59:15] the opening of the seals was for the
[59:17] prophet and the prophet alone.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; But that's not what the prophet said.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; So in the opening of the seals, what is
[59:27] it doing? It's showing us where we come
[59:30] from, who we are, and where we're going.
[59:33] And it showed it so clearly, my brother
[59:35] and sister, that every son and daughter
[59:38] of God that's anointed by the spirit of
[59:40] God, the Holy Ghost, is going to
[59:42] recognize that. Thank you, Lord, that I
[59:45] see where I come from. I see who I am
[59:49] and I see where I am going.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God did not want that to remain a
[59:54] mystery in your life or my life. He
[59:57] wants that to be very, very clear that
[1:00:00] we could recognize that. Amen. You You
[1:00:03] don't You don't go out on a journey
[1:00:05] unless you got nothing better to do in
[1:00:07] your life. You don't go on a journey and
[1:00:09] drive down the road and say, "You know
[1:00:11] what? I think I'll take two lefts and a
[1:00:13] right and then go straight and see where
[1:00:15] that takes me." No, you look at the road
[1:00:17] map and you see this is my destination.
[1:00:21] And our destination as the bride of
[1:00:23] Jesus Christ is clearly explained in the
[1:00:26] opening of the seals. Amen. and a why
[1:00:29] that we are here today and who we are
[1:00:32] and what God called us to be. Amen. It's
[1:00:35] not just a journey of uncertainties. But
[1:00:39] as a real believer, Amen. we've come to
[1:00:42] this junction of time which is called
[1:00:44] the last church age. But even within the
[1:00:47] last church age, there's these smaller
[1:00:49] junctions that we come to. Amen. And the
[1:00:52] prophet of God, I won't go into it this
[1:00:54] morning. It' take a little bit. But the
[1:00:55] prophet of God as he's preaching
[1:00:57] bringing the message down 63 64 65 he's
[1:01:02] actually laying out the description of
[1:01:05] these junctions. Amen. And I'll just use
[1:01:07] the very simplest one. He comes to a
[1:01:10] place. He says, "I'll no longer call you
[1:01:13] church. I'll call you bride." Amen. What
[1:01:17] was that adjunction that we come to that
[1:01:19] we're no longer just a church, but we
[1:01:21] are the bride of Jesus Christ? Can we
[1:01:24] say amen to that today? We are that
[1:01:26] bride the prophet of God was talking
[1:01:29] about. We've come to that junction, but
[1:01:31] there's junctions since then.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's junctions that have come
[1:01:36] since then. Amen. So, you see, if we
[1:01:40] have to be careful not to create our own
[1:01:42] truth of our version of what we think
[1:01:46] the word meant, brother Brandham, and I
[1:01:48] didn't put quotes here because I didn't
[1:01:50] know which one of the 50 to to do. So,
[1:01:53] but brother Brown talks several places.
[1:01:56] He talks about a one-man denomination.
[1:02:00] So, we can become a denomination in
[1:02:02] ourself that I am right. I have the
[1:02:06] answers. God spoke to me. They're wrong.
[1:02:09] They don't know what they're talking
[1:02:10] about. I am the one. Amen. Now, look, my
[1:02:14] brother and sister, you'll find that
[1:02:16] there are times that good people get
[1:02:19] ideas in their head and it takes them.
[1:02:21] And I remember many years ago, I won't
[1:02:23] name names just in case you might know
[1:02:25] him, but this brother had determined
[1:02:27] that God had called him to be the one to
[1:02:30] announce the convocation of the opening
[1:02:32] of the finish, the start of the finish
[1:02:34] of the word. He wrote me and several
[1:02:37] other brothers many letters and and I
[1:02:40] felt I felt kind of privileged that he
[1:02:43] would view me as such that he said I
[1:02:45] want you to be the opening speaker and I
[1:02:48] want you to be the closing speaker.
[1:02:52] I don't remember him saying I prayed
[1:02:54] about it. He just made a decision
[1:02:58] that I mean just think saints how
[1:03:02] impressive that is to be the guy who
[1:03:03] gets to preach the sermon that starts
[1:03:06] the rapture.
[1:03:14] But I couldn't find anywhere
[1:03:17] to support his claim that God said
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; I had to politely. It didn't turn out
[1:03:25] quite so well. I need to go to diplomacy
[1:03:28] school.
[1:03:29] But I had to take him back in the word
[1:03:34] and then he become offended.
[1:03:37] And then after I was at one moment
[1:03:39] chosen to be this special speaker
[1:03:42] after I told him I don't see it in the
[1:03:45] word,
[1:03:47] God changed his mind and I wasn't a
[1:03:48] speaker at all.
[1:03:52] That's how you become a one-man
[1:03:54] denomination.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You set the groundwork of what everyone
[1:03:58] else must accept and do and believe and
[1:04:02] how they must live and how No, my
[1:04:05] brother and sister, this is not this is
[1:04:07] not what God wants. He wants you and I
[1:04:10] to be fully committed to his word. Amen.
[1:04:13] Not committed to our version of his
[1:04:15] word, but to pray for revelation. Amen.
[1:04:18] The prophet of God. I know maybe we've
[1:04:20] wore that out but the prophet of God
[1:04:22] said you're going to pray for one thing
[1:04:24] pray for revelation. Amen. My my brother
[1:04:27] and sister you know the Holy Ghost is a
[1:04:29] revelation. So it's not like he put
[1:04:32] having praying for the Holy Ghost out of
[1:04:33] the picture. It is a revelation. Amen.
[1:04:36] Many things in this Bible that we have
[1:04:39] and this message that we have is a
[1:04:41] revelation. Amen. You go out here, the
[1:04:44] next man down the road, he says, "I
[1:04:46] don't see it." But to you and I, it is
[1:04:49] so clear on the page that we see it and
[1:04:52] we say, "How can they not see this?"
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And we do our very best in the human
[1:04:58] element to convince them.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, we can't
[1:05:02] convince them because they were not
[1:05:04] appointed to that.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not speaking that to be harsh,
[1:05:08] but simply there are people, Amen. We've
[1:05:12] got the picture of I call her a sister
[1:05:14] uh on our fridge that many years ago uh
[1:05:18] it was just some very supernatural
[1:05:20] things but it come down to just uh uh
[1:05:23] they could not accept that the trinity
[1:05:26] wasn't true
[1:05:30] and I'll share this much of the story.
[1:05:34] The church they come out of didn't
[1:05:36] baptize you until you were like 40 years
[1:05:38] old. That way you'd have enough time to
[1:05:40] be fully committed.
[1:05:44] What are we going to do about our
[1:05:45] children?
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That know that God's called them.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And it's a fire burning in their soul.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Do we tell them wait another 30 or 40
[1:05:56] years?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; No. Something out of a one-man
[1:06:02] doctrine.
[1:06:05] But I tell you how gracious God is.
[1:06:09] Here they are.
[1:06:12] Their exact age I don't remember at the
[1:06:13] moment.
[1:06:16] When she went to get baptized,
[1:06:21] they're there
[1:06:24] and the man got confused.
[1:06:27] He just baptized her husband in the
[1:06:29] Trinity
[1:06:31] and he's standing out there in the Snake
[1:06:33] River.
[1:06:35] And he goes to baptize her
[1:06:40] and he says, "I baptize you in the name
[1:06:43] of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:06:47] Brings her up out of the water and says,
[1:06:50] "I I don't know
[1:06:52] why I said that.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Do you want me to baptize you and father
[1:06:57] son?" She says, "Nope."
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm telling you,
[1:07:05] my brother and sister, God knows his
[1:07:07] own.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there's be things in their
[1:07:11] life that I don't see. I don't
[1:07:13] understand. She's now passed. But my
[1:07:16] brother and sister, you see that God
[1:07:17] knows his own. He's willing to deal with
[1:07:19] his own the way he chooses to deal with
[1:07:22] his own.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; He's not asking you and I to give an
[1:07:26] opinion on how he should deal with this.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; He just wants us to come and stand solid
[1:07:32] on the word and trust the word, obey the
[1:07:35] word, be washed by the word. Amen. And
[1:07:37] confess the word.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now when you look at these
[1:07:41] things like this, you'll see that as God
[1:07:44] is doing uh if if we're not careful, we
[1:07:47] become a one-man denomination,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; one woman, one person, however you want
[1:07:52] to put it
[1:07:55] because we are sure we know the answer.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; My remember
[1:08:03] this just a random thought that's not
[1:08:05] random. I think God just gave this to
[1:08:07] me. Remember, brother Brandham, a
[1:08:09] family, their son snuck out, went down
[1:08:13] the highway, d died in a car crash. You
[1:08:16] remember that story?
[1:08:19] And they come to brother Brandham.
[1:08:22] What happened? What's we don't
[1:08:24] understand what's happened to our son
[1:08:27] now? He's dead.
[1:08:30] Brother Brandham says, you know, I'll
[1:08:31] I'll go
[1:08:33] seek the face of the Lord.
[1:08:37] You guys remember that story?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham comes back and tells
[1:08:41] the family.
[1:08:44] I went, reached out, asked the Lord to
[1:08:46] give me understanding. I reached out
[1:08:50] and he's in a place of great light.
[1:08:55] A kid who snuck out of his house, went
[1:08:59] and got in a car with some other
[1:09:00] friends. Usually those kind of attitudes
[1:09:03] don't really bode well, right?
[1:09:07] But God knew his own.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And when he shows Brother Brandham where
[1:09:12] that young man's at, he shows him a
[1:09:15] place of light.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; It isn't the light of the flicker of the
[1:09:20] fires of hell.
[1:09:22] But it's a great glowing light.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brandham could not
[1:09:27] guarantee that child, you know, he
[1:09:29] couldn't guarantee to the parents, but
[1:09:32] he did see what he saw.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he reported what he saw.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And he didn't come to change the
[1:09:39] scripture. He didn't come to change
[1:09:40] anything. All he did is testify of what
[1:09:43] he saw.
[1:09:46] That didn't make him a one-man
[1:09:47] denomination.
[1:09:48] He was testifying of what God had
[1:09:50] revealed to him. Amen. And we're here
[1:09:53] today. Each one of us, our experience as
[1:09:57] believers is a little bit different.
[1:10:01] And some will say, "Oh, I saw it like
[1:10:04] this." And some would say, "You know
[1:10:06] what? Like brother Barry Coffey's
[1:10:07] testimony, you know, being raised up in
[1:10:10] the Catholic church and then going over
[1:10:12] on his great world journey and going to
[1:10:14] all of these places." You I don't know
[1:10:16] if all of you know that testimony, but
[1:10:18] if you don't, you ought to find it and
[1:10:20] listen to it. Amen. Because it shows how
[1:10:23] that brother Barry, long-haired, smoked
[1:10:26] cigarettes, whatever it was, it's there
[1:10:29] that he's doing that. And then God
[1:10:31] brings him to these places and
[1:10:33] everything that he was doing left a
[1:10:36] dissatisfaction in him,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; left a void in him.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. They went I can't even think of
[1:10:43] the name of that um where the fountain
[1:10:46] is.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; It It's pretty funny story. I have to
[1:10:49] share. Sorry, I I can't remember all the
[1:10:51] details, but over there there's this
[1:10:53] supposedly this supernatural event took
[1:10:56] place and and there's water running from
[1:10:58] the rock and brother Barry being brother
[1:11:00] Barry, he goes over there and he's
[1:11:02] looking at this thing and then he walks
[1:11:04] around on the back side of it and then
[1:11:06] he's telling all of his friends,
[1:11:08] "There's a pipe here. This is not water
[1:11:11] coming out of a rock. THIS IS A PIPE
[1:11:13] RIGHT HERE." And they're all like, "Oh,
[1:11:17] we don't care. The water's still coming
[1:11:19] out of the rock.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It was the only one of that group.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; That that affected
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Barry.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; But what was God doing? He was moving
[1:11:28] Brother Barry. He didn't move those
[1:11:30] other men.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was moving Brother Barry.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God's doing. Amen.
[1:11:36] Whether it's a pipe and a rock or
[1:11:38] something supernatural, you have your
[1:11:40] own little vision. You have your own
[1:11:42] little situation, a dream, and it comes
[1:11:44] to pass perfectly. And you look at that.
[1:11:47] That was for you. It's not for the
[1:11:49] world. It's not to cause the whole world
[1:11:51] to line up to your point of view. God
[1:11:54] gave you something special for you to
[1:11:57] come to a place and say, "You know what?
[1:11:59] God was dealing with me."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help us.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Not to be a denomination.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Now, in the sermon, end time evangelism
[1:12:11] says Jesus counts character, not
[1:12:14] members. You know that he counts
[1:12:17] characters. God has always tried to get
[1:12:20] one man in his hand. That's all he needs
[1:12:24] is one man. He'll do his work through
[1:12:26] the years. Just think he could only find
[1:12:29] one righteous man in the time of Noah.
[1:12:31] In the time of Moses, he only found one
[1:12:34] righteous man. Now look at paragraph 194
[1:12:37] here and look at Samson. See, God can
[1:12:41] only use what you surrender to him.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. Here's Samson was
[1:12:49] a big strong man. He had a lot of
[1:12:51] strength. Samson surrendered his
[1:12:53] strength to God, but he wouldn't give
[1:12:55] his heart.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So, we can come to the place that we in
[1:13:00] our one-man denomination feel like if I
[1:13:02] sacrifice this, then everything else is
[1:13:06] settled. It's finished. But God wants
[1:13:08] the heart. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can we can you know what is it?
[1:13:12] Lint or whatever you know I got a friend
[1:13:15] I'm sorry that's probably a little over
[1:13:16] the side but I got a friend you know and
[1:13:19] he just out of nowhere tells me yeah we
[1:13:22] chose as a family uh our sacrifice for
[1:13:25] Lent. I'm like oh I'm interested. Tell
[1:13:28] me we're not going to eat chocolate
[1:13:30] during Lent.
[1:13:34] Okay.
[1:13:37] Okay. You're going to gorge on chocolate
[1:13:39] before Lent and you're going to gorge on
[1:13:42] chocolate after Lent,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; but for those few short days, no
[1:13:46] chocolate.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Is that really a surrender? Is that
[1:13:49] really a sacrifice?
[1:13:51] No, my brother and sister, if we're not
[1:13:53] careful, though, we'll create something
[1:13:55] of our own thinking.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; I'll give this up.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; But he said he wouldn't give up his
[1:14:05] heart.
[1:14:07] The quote goes on if you want to go look
[1:14:10] it up. He says he gave it to Delilah.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; So totally carnal. You know, we won't go
[1:14:19] into Delilah.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; But Samson wasn't the only man on earth
[1:14:23] that Delilah had entertained.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So he wouldn't give his heart to God,
[1:14:28] but he give it to Delilah. So you see
[1:14:31] what it was is he had reasoned in his
[1:14:33] mind
[1:14:35] that at this junction of time in his
[1:14:37] life if I just give God my strength
[1:14:42] in fact the quote goes on further and
[1:14:44] brother Brandham says I probably should
[1:14:46] have posted that. Brother Brandham says
[1:14:48] you know they'll give all kinds of money
[1:14:50] pay off the church uh remodel the church
[1:14:52] make a more beautiful church they'll do
[1:14:54] all of this but they won't give their
[1:14:57] heart
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; to God. Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's a one-man denomination.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Because they're giving what they want to
[1:15:05] give,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; not what God asks for.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Are we good?
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; No. So, we come to a junction. 1
[1:15:14] Corinthians the 2 chapter 11-16.
[1:15:19] For what man knoweth the things of a
[1:15:22] man, save the spirit of a man which is
[1:15:24] in him? Even so, the things of God
[1:15:26] knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.
[1:15:29] So, let's just go back to the first part
[1:15:30] of verse 11. Amen. We know, this is
[1:15:34] going to sound blunt, forgive me. We
[1:15:36] know what it's like to have the spirit
[1:15:38] of a man. We have lied. We have cheated.
[1:15:41] We have stolen. We have lusted of the
[1:15:44] flesh. We have all these things. We know
[1:15:46] what it is to be the spirit of a man.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Brothers, can you say amen?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; There's there's where it's at. We know
[1:15:56] what it's like to be in that position.
[1:15:58] But I tell you what we really need to be
[1:16:00] is to know what it is to be in the
[1:16:03] spirit of God.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the one that really
[1:16:07] matters is not in the spirit of man, but
[1:16:10] to be in the spirit of God. To know what
[1:16:13] that is like. To be able to testify of
[1:16:15] that. To have young men that would come
[1:16:18] and say, "You know what? I I'm
[1:16:20] struggling with this. I I don't know
[1:16:22] what to do. And be able to come and hear
[1:16:26] words of not how carnal we were, not how
[1:16:29] wicked we were, that we were the biggest
[1:16:31] drunk, that we were the biggest this,
[1:16:33] the biggest that, but to say, "Hey,
[1:16:36] there's a spirit out here called the
[1:16:38] Holy Spirit. It will come in this
[1:16:40] junction of time. It will deliver you."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll pull you out of that
[1:16:45] darkness. It'll pull you out of that
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and set you free.
[1:16:51] Amen. Now, we've received not the spirit
[1:16:54] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[1:16:55] God, that we might know the things that
[1:16:58] are freely given to us.
[1:17:01] Imagine
[1:17:04] rejecting things freely given to us.
[1:17:10] God says, "Here it is. I know my own. I
[1:17:14] know what you need."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:17] And we would say, "I know what I want
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and they don't match."
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not being too blunt, am I today? Are
[1:17:28] we okay?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; But the natural man receiveth not the
[1:17:34] things of the spirit of God, for they
[1:17:36] are foolishness unto him, neither can he
[1:17:39] know them, because they are spiritually
[1:17:41] discerned. But he that is spiritual
[1:17:44] judgeth all things, yet he himself is
[1:17:46] judge of no man. For who hath known the
[1:17:49] mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
[1:17:52] him. I love the closing of this verse.
[1:17:56] Amen. Because it comes down and so
[1:17:58] emphatically drives down that stake.
[1:18:02] Amen. Can you rejoice with me? The word
[1:18:05] says, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can sat here this morning
[1:18:12] not boastful, not coming here as
[1:18:14] arrogant or or narcissistic or any of
[1:18:17] those things, my brother and sister, but
[1:18:19] the word says that you have the mind of
[1:18:22] Christ. And that is what changes our
[1:18:25] whole picture, changes us from carnal
[1:18:28] men into spiritual men, changes us from
[1:18:31] every issue we had in our life to a life
[1:18:34] full of liberty is because God has
[1:18:37] allowed. He's opened up the seventh seal
[1:18:40] and allowed his mind to come down.
[1:18:42] People say, "What about those other six
[1:18:44] ages? What is happening?" They received
[1:18:46] their portion, but they have not receive
[1:18:48] what God gave to you.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the age where God said,
[1:18:52] "I'm going to pour out all of the
[1:18:54] mystery on people. It will all COME TO
[1:18:57] PASS. IT WILL ALL BE FULFILLED." SO,
[1:19:00] we're sitting here today. Amen. And one
[1:19:02] of the greatest gifts. I mean, how would
[1:19:05] you turn down any gift from God?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; But do you realize how great the gift is
[1:19:09] when God says, "I'm going to let you
[1:19:10] even have my own mind.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He's already given us his heart. He's
[1:19:20] already poured his spirit into us.
[1:19:23] He's done all these other things. And
[1:19:25] now he says, "Wait,
[1:19:28] I'll cause you to even think like me.
[1:19:32] Oh boy. You talk about something
[1:19:35] special.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not thinking like Le Oysia.
[1:19:40] I'm sorry to say it this way. Maybe we
[1:19:42] should mute the mic. Amen. I don't want
[1:19:44] to think like Mr. Trump.
[1:19:48] I don't want to think like all of these
[1:19:50] other people, you know, the Bezos and
[1:19:53] whatever these names are. I I don't I
[1:19:55] don't even want to think like them. I
[1:19:57] want to have the mind of Christ.
[1:19:59] I want his Holy Spirit to come down in
[1:20:02] me. Amen. To where when I'm thinking, I
[1:20:05] think his thoughts.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a junction in time that
[1:20:09] we've come to, saints, that God is
[1:20:11] pouring his word into a bride. And she's
[1:20:14] here to receive that and to act on that
[1:20:17] word in the exact same fashion that
[1:20:20] Jesus Christ would if he was standing
[1:20:23] here right now.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That is incredible.
[1:20:28] See, we're coming to a junction
[1:20:31] where the word is more real than our own
[1:20:33] thoughts.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; The word is so much more real to us.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Everything about it.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:43] Where the promise of God is more real
[1:20:46] than what we feel or see.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Wait.
[1:20:54] Leodysia is like a mud hole.
[1:20:57] You climb in, it sticks to you.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You don't get into the wallow of
[1:21:03] Leodysia and walk out clean. That's
[1:21:06] right.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You need some washing.
[1:21:10] Now, look, I know this is probably not
[1:21:13] appropriate, but I'm going to say it
[1:21:14] anyway. We raised hogs for
[1:21:19] way too long.
[1:21:22] All you had to do is walk through those
[1:21:25] buildings by those pins
[1:21:29] and you'd go back and people would be
[1:21:32] like, "You stink."
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; That's le oysia.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to run jump in.
[1:21:41] You just walk by it.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; This is why we need the washing of the
[1:21:47] word.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't sin. I didn't lie, cheat,
[1:21:51] steal, lust in the flesh. I didn't do
[1:21:52] all these. No, but you just walked right
[1:21:54] down through there. You need a washing.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's the world we live in.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing for us.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, this voice I I just talking
[1:22:09] with a brother here a few days ago, you
[1:22:11] know, and and uh this voice, you know,
[1:22:14] people are saying that's just the voice
[1:22:15] of a man. I'm here to tell you it's not
[1:22:18] the voice of a man. Amen. It's not
[1:22:21] attracted to the man. That voice that
[1:22:24] resonates something deep, something full
[1:22:27] in us, touches us where we live, that's
[1:22:29] not the voice of a man. Amen. That's God
[1:22:33] behind that voice. Just like God is
[1:22:36] behind your voice. And I would put it to
[1:22:38] you this direct. Have you ever
[1:22:41] encouraged someone and made an absolute
[1:22:43] difference in their life by your words
[1:22:45] of encouragement? What was it? Was it
[1:22:48] your voice?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Was it you? It was God behind you. Amen.
[1:22:53] Speaking out cuz you spoke things you
[1:22:56] didn't even know
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; and touch their life.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not a man's voice.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; This word touches us. It has what we
[1:23:06] need.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] Got it.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Now look at this here. Don't let me get
[1:23:10] too sidetracked here.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; The Lord knew what would attract you.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You see some people it's the
[1:23:28] supernatural.
[1:23:29] Now this is not what they end up
[1:23:31] focusing on. This what God uses for an
[1:23:33] attraction.
[1:23:35] Some it's the supernatural,
[1:23:37] some it's deep things. They're
[1:23:40] intellectual thinking kind of men.
[1:23:44] Amen. Our brother stroke off the book
[1:23:47] that he wrote. Somebody said, "Why did
[1:23:49] you write such a hard book to read?" And
[1:23:52] he said, "I didn't write it for you.
[1:23:55] I wrote it for my other fellow rocket
[1:23:58] scientists."
[1:24:00] So God put that in their lap
[1:24:04] so that they could read it with words
[1:24:06] I've never even heard of.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; But they have. They know what those
[1:24:12] words mean.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; They think that way. They needed
[1:24:15] something deep.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's boring. It's for the
[1:24:19] simple peasants.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; I've met a few people like that.
[1:24:25] And some it's all about simplicity.
[1:24:32] And some want it to shake and move like
[1:24:35] nothing's ever shook or moved their
[1:24:37] life.
[1:24:41] But how do we reconcile this? Some
[1:24:45] pulled by supernatural, some by deep
[1:24:48] things, some by simplicity, some wanting
[1:24:50] to be shook.
[1:24:53] Well, Matthew 24:28
[1:24:55] says, "For wheresoever the carcass is,
[1:24:59] that's right, there will the eagles be
[1:25:02] gathered together." So, it don't matter
[1:25:05] if you are a highly intellectual person.
[1:25:09] You like to keep life at the simplest
[1:25:11] level. You know God is real, but you
[1:25:15] don't need to to, you know, have heavens
[1:25:18] and earth, so to speak, shook to prove
[1:25:20] it to you.
[1:25:22] You see, what attracted every one of
[1:25:24] these types of personalities
[1:25:26] was a carcass.
[1:25:29] That's what drew them. That's what drew
[1:25:32] you.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And I will put it this way a little bit
[1:25:35] strong maybe. If anything else drew you
[1:25:39] besides the carcass,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; then get ready to be shook out.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; It's kind of straightforward. I don't
[1:25:47] mean to be offensive, but if anything
[1:25:50] other than the carcass drew you,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; sooner or later, you will be like the
[1:25:55] wheat seed along the side of the road
[1:25:57] and it'll be choked out. It'll dry up.
[1:26:00] It'll do all these different things.
[1:26:02] Amen. But on the good soil,
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; on the good soil, wheresoever the
[1:26:07] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[1:26:09] gathered together. See, it's a body word
[1:26:12] of the son of man.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And what is that? It's another junction
[1:26:16] in time. And when that body word come
[1:26:18] down and started to be revealed to a
[1:26:20] bride, started to be revealed to a
[1:26:22] people and they were able to take a hold
[1:26:24] of that and say, I I may not be very
[1:26:27] smart. I may not be this, I may not be
[1:26:29] that, but that's the truth and that's
[1:26:32] who I am. See God bringing them to that
[1:26:34] junction in time.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; What was attracting us? Let me hurry up,
[1:26:41] get finished here. Anointed ones at the
[1:26:43] end time. Now, I like how this is.
[1:26:49] Remember in our conversation, Brother
[1:26:50] Pavle, I was telling you about some of
[1:26:53] these things we experienced
[1:26:55] and how you say things.
[1:26:58] You don't know. You're a little shocked
[1:27:00] by what you say. You didn't have any
[1:27:03] information. You said something without
[1:27:06] any natural knowledge. It just come out
[1:27:10] of you.
[1:27:13] Look what brother Brown says here. I
[1:27:16] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[1:27:18] river. I was only standing there when he
[1:27:22] appeared.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these
[1:27:26] things and foretells these things that
[1:27:29] happens as perfect as they are. I'm only
[1:27:32] one that's near when he does it.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You hold on to that right there
[1:27:38] and you'll never get a big head. Right.
[1:27:41] Amen. The scripture says that that uh uh
[1:27:44] you shouldn't have a novice for your
[1:27:46] pastor lest he be lifted up.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; See what happens is is God comes down
[1:27:52] does some things and some people say,
[1:27:54] "Wow, man. I'm the I'm the man,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; but they need this revelation.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; God just allowed him to be there."
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he did the work.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] when he does it. I'm only a voice that
[1:28:12] he used to say it.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Man, this just kills some of these
[1:28:16] people what they
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; what they're trying to make Brother
[1:28:19] Brandham into. This just kills them.
[1:28:21] They don't quote this.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; They don't quote this quote.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Because when they do, they would have to
[1:28:28] acknowledge that brother Brandham is
[1:28:29] pushing himself entirely away from this
[1:28:32] and saying, "It's not me, it's the
[1:28:35] Lord."
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they Well, anyway, we won't go
[1:28:40] there.
[1:28:42] See, now, Brother David preached on this
[1:28:44] the other day, and I thought it was
[1:28:46] good. Really straightforward, pretty
[1:28:48] bold. He didn't He didn't You didn't see
[1:28:52] him up here shredding any lavender and
[1:28:55] sharing the smell out in the church, you
[1:28:57] know? So, you'd all be like, "That hurt,
[1:28:59] but it sure smelled good."
[1:29:03] But look where it comes from.
[1:29:06] It wasn't what I knew.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; It's what I just surrendered myself to.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That fit every one of us in this
[1:29:15] building today.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; It won't be what you know. You might be
[1:29:18] able to quote this message, right? And
[1:29:20] front and back and sideways, it won't
[1:29:22] matter. But if you haven't surrendered
[1:29:24] yourself, so we already had that quote,
[1:29:26] right? We're seeing where Samson gave
[1:29:29] his strength, but he wouldn't give his
[1:29:30] heart.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we are. now makes you
[1:29:34] wonder just how this all fits together.
[1:29:36] Amen. Because it wasn't what I knew,
[1:29:38] it's what I surrendered myself to that
[1:29:40] he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't
[1:29:45] the seventh angel. Oh no, it was the
[1:29:48] manifestation of the son of man. It
[1:29:51] wasn't the angel, his message. It was
[1:29:54] the mystery that God unfolded. Come on,
[1:29:58] my brother and sister. Every
[1:29:59] supernatural thing that any minister has
[1:30:02] ever spoke of and discerned and ever hit
[1:30:06] something that went right in your life,
[1:30:07] it wasn't that preacher. It was God
[1:30:10] coming down saying, "This is my son.
[1:30:12] This is my daughter. And I'm going to
[1:30:14] have a conversation with you today. I
[1:30:16] want to keep you from going over here
[1:30:18] and getting sidetracked or derailed. I'm
[1:30:21] going to do this."
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I'll use this man to do it.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look,
[1:30:30] it's not a man. It's God. The angel was
[1:30:33] not the son of man. He was a messenger
[1:30:35] from the son of man. The son of man is
[1:30:38] Christ. He is the one that you're
[1:30:40] feeding on. Amen. Back to the carcass.
[1:30:43] Wherever the carcass is, the bride is
[1:30:46] going to be there. Amen. He was a
[1:30:49] messenger. Amen. From the son of man.
[1:30:52] The son of man is Christ. He's the one
[1:30:54] that you're feeding on. You're not
[1:30:56] feeding on a man.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; I know this is straightforward, saints,
[1:31:02] but remember I read you a quote and some
[1:31:04] of you even said, "Amen." That we need
[1:31:06] to know the truth.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; We need to know the truth. It needs to
[1:31:10] be brought out as sugarcoating it, never
[1:31:12] touching it is not truth.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; We need to be able to recognize the
[1:31:16] spirits of the day want us to turn
[1:31:19] brother Brandham into Daniel as he was
[1:31:23] there in the kingdom. And those
[1:31:25] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were not
[1:31:28] going to worship Daniel.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; They absolutely refused even as it was
[1:31:33] to go to the fiery furnace. We will not
[1:31:37] bow down.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same spirit has not died.
[1:31:41] It's here today. Did God send us a
[1:31:43] prophet? He opened the word. It changed
[1:31:46] our lives. It set us free. IT GAVE US
[1:31:49] REVELATION. BUT HE'S NOT OUR GOD.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Our God IS JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. And
[1:31:56] Jesus Christ has come to change your
[1:31:59] LIFE TO CHANGE MY LIFE to bring us to a
[1:32:02] place we come into a junction of time.
[1:32:04] And as it were, if we have to face a
[1:32:07] fiery furnace, I'll face it. Amen. If I
[1:32:10] have to, you know, come through fiery
[1:32:12] trials, a lion's den, whatever it might
[1:32:14] be, I'll face it. But I'm not going to
[1:32:17] worship the man.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship my Lord Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:23] And you see what we're doing? I got
[1:32:24] ahead of myself. We're coming to another
[1:32:27] junction
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; in time.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Some
[1:32:36] and I'll throw you for a loop.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Rightfully so.
[1:32:44] Look at Brother Brand and thought he was
[1:32:46] God.
[1:32:49] When I say rightfully so, because they
[1:32:52] saw so much of Christ manifested in him,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; but they didn't even listen to his own
[1:32:59] preaching.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; They didn't listen to his own words.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Because if they did, they would say he
[1:33:08] was a messenger sent to us.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; He was a carrier.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; You know, I ordered something the other
[1:33:15] day. Well, actually, Sister Jerry
[1:33:18] ordered it come Amazon. I was happy that
[1:33:21] it came. I didn't run out and bow down
[1:33:24] at the feet of the Amazon driver.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That's a poor analogy, but it needs to
[1:33:32] be that
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; that ridiculous.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have one that we are called to
[1:33:38] worship.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; We're coming into that junction of time
[1:33:44] that we will be there. Shadrach,
[1:33:46] Meshach, and Abednego said, "We won't
[1:33:48] bow down." Now, my brother and sister,
[1:33:52] they could have found a way to
[1:33:53] compromise.
[1:33:55] Would it be okay if we sat down?
[1:34:01] Would it be okay if we found another way
[1:34:03] to honor?
[1:34:07] No. They said, "Not happening.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; We're not going to bow down. We don't We
[1:34:13] have one that we worship.
[1:34:16] We're coming into this junction of time
[1:34:21] that that is repeating itself
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; here. Not here. I pray not here,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; but repeating itself again
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; once again.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; But there'll be a people, Amen. Is there
[1:34:36] any people here that are not going to
[1:34:37] bow down?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to stand up and say, "Look,
[1:34:41] I I've got one redeemer. I've got one
[1:34:43] savior. I've got one healer. I've got
[1:34:44] one provider. I don't need another. I
[1:34:46] don't need a substitute. I don't need
[1:34:48] someone to fill that void in. There's
[1:34:51] nothing. People say, "Well, Brother
[1:34:52] Brandham didn't finish up his message."
[1:34:54] That's right. Because God knew he gave
[1:34:56] to the bride. The bride would pray for
[1:34:59] revelation and she would get what she
[1:35:01] needed. And because brother Brandham
[1:35:03] also makes a statement said this will
[1:35:05] not be a public show. Amen. That's the
[1:35:08] only way. Imagine if God come down and
[1:35:10] we had great teaching seminars on what
[1:35:13] the seals were, great teaching seminars
[1:35:15] on all these things. My brother and
[1:35:17] sister, let me tell you, we were in that
[1:35:19] conference in Europe. In that conference
[1:35:21] right there, 7800 people, there are
[1:35:24] people of every persuasion in the
[1:35:26] message there. Now, they have an
[1:35:30] agreement, you might say, amongst
[1:35:31] themselves
[1:35:32] that we're not going to come here and
[1:35:34] argue doctrine. We're not going to fight
[1:35:35] with each other.
[1:35:37] But that agreement, do you think that
[1:35:39] took away their belief?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; No. There's only one thing will take
[1:35:43] away that belief and consolidate that,
[1:35:46] and that's the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; So, you see, we're coming to a junction
[1:35:53] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That's where we're coming to.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hope you don't throw me out of here.
[1:36:01] If you do, throw me softly.
[1:36:08] It's not
[1:36:10] whether you go to a message church or
[1:36:11] not.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I know some Baptists that make us all
[1:36:16] almost look ashamed for how they read
[1:36:18] their Bibles.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And so, is it just reading your Bible?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not offending anybody.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; But now we have a move in the message.
[1:36:32] lapel pins and ink pins and
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; even belt buckles are coming back.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; I don't say this to mock anybody, but
[1:36:41] when I was a kid, you weren't in the
[1:36:43] message unless you had an eagle belt
[1:36:45] buckle.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; So, you could walk around church and see
[1:36:49] who was serious about the message.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; They don't have an eagle belt buckle.
[1:36:55] They don't really believe. Oh, and with
[1:36:57] the eagle belt buckle, you needed a
[1:36:59] cowboy hat.
[1:37:01] And if you had a cowboy hat, you needed
[1:37:04] your own version of a blondie, the
[1:37:08] rifle.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Then that was evidence you were the
[1:37:11] message. Nothing about having the Holy
[1:37:14] Ghost.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Not h nothing about being led by the
[1:37:17] Holy Spirit.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing new under the
[1:37:21] sun.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And these things are cycling
[1:37:26] once again.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; They're coming back. We need a little
[1:37:30] icon. Do you know we were there in the
[1:37:34] Netherlands?
[1:37:35] Well, that was actually Germany.
[1:37:38] They have the bones
[1:37:40] of the three wise men in that cathedral
[1:37:43] in Cologne.
[1:37:45] Now, how those bones ever made it
[1:37:49] to Cologne, Germany?
[1:37:51] And how, if you ever drop those, would
[1:37:54] you know which bone was which?
[1:38:02] I'm going to offend you.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Some segments of this message
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; are almost that bad.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Today,
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; what are we doing? We're coming to
[1:38:19] another junction and time.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; God, help us. Sister Vikica, would you
[1:38:25] come? God, help us to make the right
[1:38:27] decision.
[1:38:29] Amen. To have the right understanding.
[1:38:33] Amen. To see that.
[1:38:37] I got one more quote. I skip over a few
[1:38:39] things in my notes here. I got one more
[1:38:41] quote. What is the attraction on the
[1:38:43] mountain? I love this. When I read this
[1:38:45] the other day, I just got excited about
[1:38:47] this. That's what the attraction is. The
[1:38:50] predestinated seed of God who can't do
[1:38:54] nothing else but follow it
[1:38:58] means more than life to us.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; My how simple can it get?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You can't even help yourself.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Wait, I believe the message.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I did. You really?
[1:39:14] Or the scripture says it's Christ in
[1:39:16] you?
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; That's exactly it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in us. Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; We've come in that junction, my brother
[1:39:22] and sister. When you see something good,
[1:39:27] you see something supernatural, you see
[1:39:30] something that that just is so
[1:39:32] outstanding, you just like, "Wow."
[1:39:36] I give you an example. I'm not I'm not
[1:39:38] talking about Paul. I was just there
[1:39:40] when it happened. Had a sister one time
[1:39:42] call me say, "My little baby girl, she's
[1:39:45] got like 106, seven fever.
[1:39:49] scared me. I'm like, "Oh my."
[1:39:53] And she said, "Brother Paul, do you know
[1:39:55] anybody in our area that could come and
[1:39:57] pray for my baby?
[1:40:00] They didn't live around here."
[1:40:03] And I said, "Honestly, sister, I don't.
[1:40:06] But why don't you
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; lay your hand
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; on that baby?
[1:40:13] Pray the prayer of faith
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; and watch God honor your your prayer.
[1:40:21] God honor you as a daughter of God.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; She called me back like 40 minutes later
[1:40:28] and said, "The fever's gone."
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; What is it, my brother and sister? We
[1:40:32] don't need to look to another person.
[1:40:35] You're the bride of Christ. God called
[1:40:37] you. He poured his word into you, and
[1:40:40] his word is life.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He poured that into you.
[1:40:45] Amen. Let's stand up and take what is
[1:40:47] rightfully ours. Amen. And claim what is
[1:40:49] rightfully ours and speak what is
[1:40:51] rightfully ours and act upon it. Very
[1:40:54] first quote I read to you there. God
[1:40:56] doesn't want us being just laying
[1:40:58] around. He wants us to get up and do
[1:41:00] something. Hallelujah. God bless you
[1:41:02] today. Thank you for your patience.
[1:41:05] Amen. Let's just stand worship the Lord
[1:41:07] a little bit. Amen.
[1:41:12] Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] 10:31 Brother Isaac
[1:41:28] F ever.
[1:41:31] Hallelu
[1:41:34] Hering
[1:41:38] God. Can you say amen to that?
[1:41:42] Oh hallelu
[1:41:45] is an answering
[1:41:49] God.
[1:41:53] And when I pray
[1:41:56] in Jesus name
[1:41:59] and by faith
[1:42:01] the answer came. Oh hallelu
[1:42:08] is an answering
[1:42:11] God.
[1:42:15] Oh hallelu
[1:42:19] is an answering
[1:42:22] God.
[1:42:27] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:30] He's an answering
[1:42:34] God.
[1:42:38] Oh, when I pray
[1:42:41] in Jesus name
[1:42:43] and by faith the answer came.
[1:42:49] Oh, hallelu.
[1:42:52] He's an answering
[1:42:56] door. 10:16.
[1:42:59] Amen. Is he in the house this morning?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Alex
[1:43:09] G. Yeah. Sorry about that.
[1:43:16] Little girl was lying there
[1:43:20] and people all
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; laughed at Jesus
[1:43:30] and he said she's only free.
[1:43:37] As he took her by the hand,
[1:43:42] she began to live again.
[1:43:47] Some began to praise the Lord.
[1:43:52] Some began to say,
[1:43:59] "He's in the house.
[1:44:04] Death has to flee.
[1:44:09] Now there is light.
[1:44:13] Where darkness used to be,
[1:44:19] now there is hope.
[1:44:24] There's no more doubt.
[1:44:28] Praise his name.
[1:44:33] Praise his name.
[1:44:38] He's in the house.
[1:44:46] We were like that little girl,
[1:44:50] dead in all our sins.
[1:44:55] Till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[1:45:00] and gave me life again.
[1:45:05] I am just a house of clay.
[1:45:11] Ever since that blessed day,
[1:45:15] there's a light that shines on me for
[1:45:20] all the world to see.
[1:45:27] He's in the house.
[1:45:32] Death has to flee.
[1:45:37] Now there is light
[1:45:41] where darkness used to be.
[1:45:46] Now there is hope.
[1:45:51] There's no more doubt.
[1:45:56] Praise his name.
[1:46:00] Praise his name.
[1:46:05] He's in the house.
[1:46:11] Amen. Number 651, please. KFC.
[1:46:17] I know not why God's wonderous
[1:46:23] grace to me he hath made known.
[1:46:31] Or why unworthy
[1:46:35] Christ in love
[1:46:38] redeemed
[1:46:39] me before his throne.
[1:46:44] But I know whom I have believed
[1:46:49] and am persuaded
[1:46:52] that he is aable
[1:46:56] to keep that which I've committed
[1:47:02] unto him
[1:47:04] against that day.
[1:47:09] I know not how this saving faith to me
[1:47:17] he did.
[1:47:21] Nor how believing
[1:47:25] in his word brought peace within my
[1:47:31] heart.
[1:47:33] But I know whom I have believed in
[1:47:39] and am persuaded
[1:47:42] that he is able
[1:47:46] to keep that which I've committed
[1:47:52] unto him
[1:47:54] against that day.
[1:47:58] I know not how the spirit moves,
[1:48:05] convinceing
[1:48:07] men of sin,
[1:48:11] revealing
[1:48:13] Jesus
[1:48:14] through the word, reating
[1:48:19] faith in him.
[1:48:23] But I know whom I have believed
[1:48:29] and am persuaded
[1:48:32] that he is aable
[1:48:35] to keep that which I've committed
[1:48:42] unto him against that day.
[1:48:48] I know not what of good or ill may be
[1:48:56] reserved for me.
[1:49:00] Of weyer
[1:49:02] ways your golden days
[1:49:07] before his face I see.
[1:49:13] But I know whom I have believed
[1:49:18] and am persuaded
[1:49:21] that he is able
[1:49:25] to keep that which I've committed
[1:49:31] not to him against that day.
[1:49:37] And I know not when my Lord may come at
[1:49:44] night or noon day fair.
[1:49:50] Nor if I'll walk the veil with him or
[1:49:56] meet him in the air.
[1:50:02] But I know who I have believed it and am
[1:50:08] persuaded
[1:50:11] that he is aable
[1:50:14] to keep that which I've committed
[1:50:20] unto him against that day.
