[38:20] for them
[38:21] but

[39:46] fellowship this next sunday
[39:50] i see some heads nodding but i don't
[39:52] hear any amens
[39:54] so is this an amen that's just on the
[39:56] front row or is it collective
[39:59] okay we'll have a fellowship after this
[40:01] coming sunday service and i i was gonna
[40:04] try and hide it but i don't think i'm
[40:06] gonna bother it's a fellowship that
[40:08] we're gonna have to welcome
[40:10] all of those recent additions to the
[40:12] church
[40:14] and
[40:15] hopefully sister april will be here to
[40:18] be welcomed as an addition but
[40:20] um you know she's she's got a lot on her
[40:23] plate you know continuing education and
[40:26] different things that's happening and
[40:28] and she's using this little time that
[40:30] she before she actually starts her
[40:32] actual work
[40:33] uh to catch up some loose ends so just
[40:36] remember her in prayer and
[40:39] let's just stand and let's go right into
[40:41] the word you know i come out this
[40:43] morning and it's just amazing
[40:45] just amazing of everything we talked
[40:47] about in the back room none of it had to
[40:49] do with what i was preaching and i come
[40:51] out to the song
[40:53] that's speaking of surrender
[40:55] and
[40:57] you can see what our thought is today
[41:00] and it's always encouraging to the heart
[41:02] when you walk out
[41:04] and um you hear words whether it's
[41:07] prayers
[41:08] comments songs and you realize this is
[41:12] in the mind of god this is in that vein
[41:14] amen and so we thank the lord for that
[41:18] because nothing better than to be in
[41:20] that vein of fellowship with the lord
[41:22] jesus christ amen let's go to our
[41:25] scripture it's quite lengthy this
[41:27] morning and i say that with a little bit
[41:28] of humor uh to come and
[41:32] this
[41:32] is the basis of our sermon today james
[41:36] the fourth chapter
[41:37] the seventh
[41:38] verse
[41:39] now do you realize saints that a man
[41:41] could preach for months
[41:43] on this little scripture right here
[41:46] he could he could build you might say a
[41:50] whole deal as brother branham said they
[41:52] come to me and ask when are you going to
[41:54] get job off of the ash heap
[41:57] and
[41:58] you know
[41:59] that's how much there is in the word
[42:01] when you start to unfold it amen james
[42:04] the fourth chapter the seventh verse
[42:07] submit yourselves therefore to god
[42:11] resist the devil and he will flee from
[42:15] you and as in all things saints i
[42:17] encourage you
[42:18] go back
[42:19] read the scripture before this read the
[42:22] scripture after this
[42:24] because you see
[42:25] we never
[42:26] want to
[42:28] just focus on one little narrow view
[42:32] we want to have the whole picture
[42:34] and we joke
[42:36] about how long sometimes some of us can
[42:38] preach
[42:40] but i'm telling you i just heard was it
[42:42] was a wonderful service wednesday night
[42:45] and i just heard brother marcus on the
[42:47] way to church say i'm a very disciplined
[42:50] preacher
[42:53] and i will be done
[42:56] very quickly and then he tells me the
[42:58] joke
[42:59] about i was preaching somewhere and the
[43:01] preacher said preach as long as you want
[43:03] but we shut the lights off at nine
[43:06] and he he's telling this and then he
[43:07] comes to church and then just
[43:10] says
[43:11] did you catch how we use some of that
[43:14] how do i wake you up
[43:16] we're closing
[43:20] no deacon with a stick hitting them in
[43:22] the head we're closing
[43:25] brings them to life he says every time
[43:28] oh my i i just i have to admit
[43:31] that i i just i try not to laugh out
[43:34] loud i don't want to give a bad example
[43:36] as my wife does but uh
[43:38] but it just it just struck me i thought
[43:40] you know we've all had those times we've
[43:42] all had those struggles and but what we
[43:45] want is for the word of god the life of
[43:48] jesus christ to empower us
[43:52] in the good days and the bad days the
[43:54] days we're just full of energy and the
[43:56] days we're wore out
[43:58] we're still sons and daughters of god
[44:02] hallelujah submit yourselves therefore
[44:04] to god resist the devil and he will flee
[44:06] from you heavenly father we ask for your
[44:08] guidance today may it be your voice
[44:10] father that speaks we ask in the name of
[44:12] jesus christ amen you may be seated
[44:18] now as we look at this saints i want to
[44:22] kind of just go through this for just a
[44:24] moment
[44:26] the word submit
[44:28] has quite a few other things concerning
[44:30] documents and proposals and writings and
[44:33] all these kind of things but we come
[44:35] down in the definition and this is off
[44:37] of online webster it says to stop trying
[44:40] to fight or resist something
[44:43] to agree to do or accept something that
[44:46] you've been resisting or opposing you
[44:48] know that really sounds like christians
[44:50] sometimes amen to yield governance or
[44:53] authority
[44:54] uh coming down as an intransitive verb
[44:57] says to yield oneself to the authority
[45:00] or will of another
[45:01] surrender
[45:03] so i love that and it's synonymous with
[45:05] the word yield amen so you look at this
[45:08] and you know it is my brother and sister
[45:10] that we look at this submit yourselves
[45:13] therefore to god now
[45:15] one might say brother brother paul how
[45:19] can i overcome and we see that was
[45:22] poised to brother branham as a question
[45:24] and he he comes and catches that thought
[45:27] and turns it into a sermon and takes
[45:29] that how can i overcome and to a young
[45:32] man and i want just to remember uh logan
[45:35] amen and just remember him in prayer
[45:38] because here's a young man that's in a
[45:39] place that's desiring he's crying out he
[45:42] wants to overcome but he doesn't know
[45:44] how and every time it seems he steps
[45:46] forward something is pushing him back
[45:49] and there's a battle that's taking place
[45:51] and he has become weary in the flesh of
[45:53] fighting the battle and we as believers
[45:56] need to rally together and surround one
[46:00] another in prayer because this is not a
[46:02] battle that we can win on our own but by
[46:05] revelation and i say it's by revelation
[46:08] that we can overcome these battles so we
[46:11] look at this and look in the order that
[46:13] we're
[46:14] looking at this scripture today and it
[46:17] says submit yourselves therefore to god
[46:19] so the very first thing that it's
[46:22] declaring right here is that we need to
[46:25] come in submission to god first amen so
[46:28] people want to overcome but they're not
[46:31] in submission to god so it's there in
[46:34] that realm that it would be and i'll be
[46:36] a little ahead of myself but i feel
[46:37] inspired that this is a place to place
[46:39] part of this my brother and sister we
[46:41] don't want to be found fighting against
[46:44] the will of god we don't want to be
[46:45] found fighting against the plan of god
[46:48] what we want to do is find ourselves in
[46:51] a position of submission that we can
[46:53] then find the authority of the word
[46:56] gives us liberty to take the promise
[46:58] amen and it's there that we look at it
[47:01] in the correct order and you know that
[47:03] we could say i i believe this morning
[47:06] that we can come to a place that we can
[47:08] say from the whole
[47:09] from the heart lord not my will
[47:12] but thy will be done now my brother and
[47:14] sister that's a lot harder than it
[47:16] sounds
[47:17] because you see we have a will
[47:24] you hear parents sometimes say you know
[47:26] it's interesting
[47:27] all of my children are these quiet meek
[47:31] submitting
[47:32] children i can correct etc
[47:34] but
[47:35] and it might be the oldest it might be
[47:37] middle it might be youngest it doesn't
[47:39] matter we're not going to pick on the
[47:40] youngest of course
[47:42] but it's there that you see that that
[47:44] can have a will
[47:45] this seems to be almost contrary until
[47:47] one day as the child is growing someone
[47:50] says oh that reminds me of your aunt or
[47:53] your uncle
[47:55] and you realize hmm
[47:57] so this really was something that was in
[47:59] our family and it just happened to pop
[48:01] up in my children too bad it hadn't been
[48:03] my brother or my sister's children it
[48:05] had to be my child
[48:07] but it's there that you realize now that
[48:09] child is going to come and until that
[48:12] will is submitted to a parent my brother
[48:15] and sister there'll be a constant
[48:16] warfare there'll be a constant friction
[48:19] as it were in the family some children
[48:22] never get over that they grow up to be
[48:24] adults that will not submit to authority
[48:26] in any form or fashion and it's there
[48:29] that it's actually to their own
[48:30] detriment now the world glorifies a
[48:32] rebellious spirit
[48:34] now i want to
[48:35] lay this little groundwork for you the
[48:37] reason the world is glorifying the
[48:39] rebellious spirit is because we're
[48:41] living in the age of rebellion and that
[48:43] spirit is something they identify with
[48:46] whether they really understand they're
[48:48] identifying or not it is the spirit of
[48:50] the age and so we look at this now you
[48:53] can go on on social sites and you can
[48:55] see how it is that there are people ah
[48:58] they're walking down the street i saw
[49:00] some little clip man walking down the
[49:02] street i believe it was in new york city
[49:04] breaking the antenna off of every car
[49:06] that he passed by now tell me my brother
[49:09] and sister that that person is normal
[49:12] no they are acting out a spirit of
[49:15] rebellion
[49:16] and so it's in that realm that it is
[49:19] that we can come and we say well i got
[49:21] saved but my brother and sister just
[49:23] coming to church does not break the
[49:26] spirit of rebellion it is not that we
[49:29] are there and they say well the prophet
[49:31] said this but i don't see it like that
[49:33] now my brother and sister depending on
[49:35] what it was that you're talking about it
[49:38] could be a spirit of rebellion
[49:39] manifesting itself because if the
[49:41] prophet is speaking from the word and
[49:44] you say i don't agree then you are
[49:46] rebelling against the word not the
[49:48] prophet not the preacher not the pastor
[49:50] but you're rebelling against the word
[49:52] and we'll see people who will come and
[49:54] they will disagree as it were now not
[49:57] defending the preacher
[50:00] should we have to defend the preacher
[50:02] no
[50:03] if the preacher is preaching the word
[50:05] you don't have to defend the preacher
[50:07] amen you see now and people will say i
[50:10] disagree
[50:15] if the preacher
[50:16] is a god-called man
[50:20] he's went and done his homework
[50:24] and you say i disagree with him
[50:26] not even knowing
[50:29] that you're actually disagreeing with
[50:31] the word
[50:36] so in that position people think they're
[50:38] just disagreeing with the man up here
[50:40] because they don't like the way he said
[50:41] it the tone of voice or his body stature
[50:43] or whatever it was when he said it and
[50:45] i'm disagreeing with that but what they
[50:47] don't realize is they're actually
[50:48] pushing back
[50:50] against the word
[50:53] good people
[50:54] we're not like turning them into
[50:56] horrible people you know horns and
[50:57] pitchforks
[50:59] good people but that spirit is there and
[51:01] without catching that they will continue
[51:04] to push back at little things in their
[51:06] life that would be good for them
[51:11] so we see this now
[51:13] the submission part comes first and
[51:15] that's where the greatest battle right
[51:17] and the wills that we would have as it
[51:19] were the will of a parent and the will
[51:21] of a child or even as between two uh
[51:24] parents or adults can be a little battle
[51:26] that is there but what we really want to
[51:28] do is come to the place that we can say
[51:31] lord not my will but thy will be done
[51:34] and in that time of making that
[51:37] confession what you don't realize is
[51:39] you're breaking down fortresses you're
[51:42] breaking down those uh places that satan
[51:45] wants to defend you're cutting away the
[51:47] chains and when you do that and you
[51:50] start making the claim lord each and
[51:52] every day lord not my will today not my
[51:55] idea today not my idea concerning this
[51:58] but your will lord is all i really care
[52:01] about and then you'll find that you're
[52:04] tearing down satan's fortress
[52:06] amen you're breaking those chains and
[52:08] satan don't like that so what he's going
[52:10] to do is throw something back at you
[52:12] that it puts it in your face and you
[52:14] it's just oh my goodness
[52:17] saints we i believe we're holy
[52:18] ghost-filled people believing the word
[52:20] of god but you ever notice how you can
[52:22] just go and go and go and go and life is
[52:24] good and then something happens in some
[52:26] old nature some old thing that you
[52:27] recognize as you from way back
[52:31] rares up
[52:33] and sometimes we
[52:35] pop the claws out
[52:38] and amazing how god made a cat
[52:42] he can call come to church he can wrap
[52:44] his arms around you
[52:46] and call you brother
[52:48] he can pat and he can purr
[52:50] and the minute you do one thing he
[52:52] doesn't like
[53:00] right
[53:02] wow
[53:03] lord don't let me be a cat of the
[53:05] message
[53:06] amen
[53:09] oh hallelujah
[53:11] look
[53:12] so we come to the place we can say that
[53:15] and then
[53:17] it's when we're able
[53:19] to submit to the lord
[53:21] submit to god look how this sentence
[53:24] look how this scripture i mean it's tied
[53:25] together it's in this submission
[53:28] then then we can come in the full force
[53:30] of resistance
[53:33] without that submission we don't have
[53:36] the position
[53:38] to resist in
[53:42] people say well i'm doing my very best
[53:44] pastor i'm doing my very best
[53:47] the question is not what are you doing
[53:48] to resist the question is have you
[53:50] submitted
[53:53] the real question is have you said lord
[53:55] thy will be done i put it first lord
[53:58] your will
[54:00] and so it is in that position
[54:02] we see that we can truly resist now look
[54:05] how this goes do you know that the devil
[54:08] doesn't have to look at your doctrine
[54:11] the devil doesn't have to even look
[54:14] at the little nuances of your life
[54:17] people are like well you know if i dress
[54:19] right and i talk right we've seen that
[54:21] happen right for years people came and
[54:23] they they said i'm a part of this and
[54:25] they dressed right and they talked right
[54:26] and they did all these things right but
[54:28] one day they came face to face with
[54:29] something and they said i ain't going no
[54:31] further i don't even believe this
[54:32] anymore
[54:33] you never believed in the beginning
[54:34] there is no any more involved you never
[54:37] believed in the beginning but see god
[54:39] has a way of bringing us down to a time
[54:41] or a place we have to face well i just
[54:43] couldn't agree with the message no what
[54:45] it was is you couldn't bring yourself to
[54:47] look in the mirror and say i'm
[54:48] submitting
[54:52] it's in that time that you've decided
[54:53] your will is greater than god's will and
[54:56] you're going to do what you want to do
[54:58] and my brother and sister it's kind of
[54:59] like opinion we've all got one and we're
[55:01] going to express it whether it's right
[55:04] or it's wrong it's good beneficial or
[55:06] not but we've got to do this because i
[55:09] have this right
[55:10] but you look now my brother and see how
[55:12] this comes about in such a fashion that
[55:15] we can say well you know what uh i i'm
[55:18] doing i'm saying the right things i'm
[55:19] dressing the right way i read my bible
[55:21] and i pray but did you know my brother
[55:23] and sister the devil doesn't have to
[55:24] look at that he just comes over here and
[55:26] looks how submitted you are
[55:30] amen
[55:31] he doesn't have to say i got to sit here
[55:33] in the room when they're studying when
[55:35] they're reading when they're praying and
[55:36] see what they pray and see what they
[55:38] read and see no no all he's got to do is
[55:40] look at the submission in life
[55:42] and when rebellion is obvious and it's
[55:44] out
[55:46] now brother brown said the devil knows
[55:48] you better than you know yourself
[55:51] so when you look at that can can you
[55:52] imagine that's almost a scary thought
[55:56] so the devil can look at us
[55:59] seven sons of
[56:01] maybe it wasn't about what doctrine they
[56:03] had
[56:05] i just put this out for an example
[56:07] maybe it wasn't about what doctrine they
[56:09] held or whatever it was but maybe the
[56:11] whole factor when they went in there to
[56:13] cast that devil out was the fact that
[56:15] their life was not submitted to god and
[56:18] so the devil says these people have no
[56:20] authority to resist me
[56:23] because it's submit or submission first
[56:27] and then comes the authority to resist
[56:30] the devil
[56:32] and without that submission then the
[56:34] devil looks and says they're they're
[56:35] toothless
[56:37] they've got no power to resist me
[56:40] and the seven sons of siva the scripture
[56:42] says come bursting out of the doors
[56:44] almost stripped naked because they had
[56:46] been beaten up and my brother and sister
[56:49] i just want to put it this way because
[56:50] i'm not preaching down to anyone today
[56:52] have you ever went in a situation and
[56:54] felt like you were beaten up when you
[56:56] come out of it i can tell you that i
[56:58] have in my life been in situations where
[57:00] i felt like that me and the devil going
[57:03] head to head that he did everything but
[57:05] hang me from the tree limb
[57:09] and then when it comes revelation and
[57:11] you look back and say you know what i
[57:13] really wasn't submitted to the lord i
[57:15] was doing what i thought
[57:17] i was doing what i felt
[57:20] i was doing what my emotions led me to
[57:23] do
[57:24] which none of those are in the word as
[57:26] commandments for us to be overcomers
[57:29] our emotion will not make us overcomers
[57:31] my brother and sister our opinion will
[57:33] not make us an overcomer all of these
[57:35] things are outside of the word they're
[57:37] not there they're giving us direction to
[57:40] overcome the devil and so it's there
[57:43] that when we come in submission
[57:45] amen and satan starts looking and he
[57:48] says okay they're not submitted they're
[57:50] not going to bring much authority or
[57:52] power against me to overcome in this
[57:54] situation so therefore i don't even have
[57:56] to listen to them but when the devil
[57:58] comes face to face with a son or
[58:00] daughter of god that is submitted to the
[58:03] word of god and satan looks at that and
[58:06] he says all my yes wife sons and
[58:08] daughters of god we don't have to go out
[58:10] here to pray for somebody grab them and
[58:13] shake them around or like a video clip i
[58:15] saw recently where the man just
[58:17] basically picked up about a 90-pound
[58:19] woman threw her on the platform and says
[58:22] we cast satan out and was going to pick
[58:24] her up again but i think it was a deacon
[58:26] there that kind of intervened it's like
[58:28] that's not how we're going to get the
[58:29] devil out we're going to get the devil
[58:31] out when we have come before our lord
[58:34] jesus christ and said lord i want my
[58:37] life i want everything about me every
[58:40] fiber of my being my thoughts my emotion
[58:43] my heart my flesh i want it submitted to
[58:46] you i'm gonna lay it down before you
[58:49] lord and that's when the devil says whoa
[58:52] whoa here's somebody who has unlocked
[58:55] the gate unlocked the door as it were
[58:58] has got into the vault and my i'm gonna
[59:01] do and that's why it doesn't take the
[59:03] aggression it doesn't take loud words it
[59:06] doesn't take force my brother and sister
[59:09] just a still small voice of a bride of
[59:12] christ coming before the throne and
[59:15] saying lord i ask you touch my child
[59:18] lord i ask you to touch this situation
[59:20] and satan says that is a submitted life
[59:23] and he as i'll read to you a little
[59:25] later starts getting ready
[59:27] to leave
[59:32] oh no no
[59:34] another video this one was out when
[59:36] video is all grainy
[59:40] man preacher running around and around
[59:41] the outside walls of a church
[59:44] somebody's like what are you doing he
[59:46] says i'm rounding up the devil
[59:49] i'm sorry my brother and sister we don't
[59:51] got to round up the devil to hurt him
[59:53] out the door
[59:54] what we got to do is get submitted to
[59:56] the lord
[59:58] and then in that submission we can start
[1:00:01] resisting
[1:00:06] my
[1:00:08] my
[1:00:10] you know that's why the devil's not
[1:00:11] afraid of most professing christians
[1:00:16] because there's a lack of sincerity
[1:00:18] lack of submission
[1:00:23] we want to do what we want to do and be
[1:00:25] who we want to be but we want god to
[1:00:27] work for us
[1:00:29] no i want to be what he wants me to be
[1:00:32] and then he promised he would work for
[1:00:34] me
[1:00:35] i don't have to come and try and get god
[1:00:37] to do it when i am what he asked me to
[1:00:40] be he said he would come and do the work
[1:00:43] for me in fact he said that's this work
[1:00:45] i started in you all finish it and this
[1:00:47] work was not to give us reputation as
[1:00:49] powerful preachers or powerful this or
[1:00:52] power for that that reputation my
[1:00:54] brother and sister is the reputation of
[1:00:56] a man or a woman who is submitted to god
[1:00:59] that's the kind of reputation i want
[1:01:01] may not be known beyond the boundaries
[1:01:03] of this city and that's all that matters
[1:01:05] i want to be known to my god
[1:01:08] hallelujah amen
[1:01:10] now you look at this
[1:01:13] spirit of denomination says just follow
[1:01:15] the church
[1:01:21] not speaking down on anyone sometimes
[1:01:23] maybe i get a little aggressive on that
[1:01:25] but my brother and sister the catholic
[1:01:27] church will simply tell you follow the
[1:01:29] church
[1:01:30] they don't really care what kind of life
[1:01:32] you have or behavior you have or what
[1:01:33] you do but they just say follow the
[1:01:36] church
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:38] the devil says just follow the church
[1:01:40] he's not afraid of you being in church
[1:01:43] you think the devil cares that people
[1:01:44] went to church this morning he doesn't
[1:01:47] amen but i tell you what my brother and
[1:01:50] sister the day comes that the word
[1:01:52] revealed to us comes and it says i want
[1:01:55] you to follow the leadership of the holy
[1:01:58] spirit
[1:01:59] i want you to follow the word when the
[1:02:02] word is opened up i want you to just
[1:02:05] follow that i don't need you to debate
[1:02:07] what language it was in and whether it
[1:02:09] was a sub dialect because these over
[1:02:12] here spoke you know this and they spoke
[1:02:14] in a little different fashion and we're
[1:02:15] not sure that the words all mean the
[1:02:17] same and you've got men that have
[1:02:18] devoted their lives in israel digging
[1:02:21] and digging and digging to find
[1:02:23] something to support the way they look
[1:02:24] at the word and they could spend those
[1:02:27] years submitting to the word and saying
[1:02:30] lord lead me to truth then i could do
[1:02:32] this but you see they want don't know
[1:02:33] whether
[1:02:34] it's the high
[1:02:35] or the low of the dialect
[1:02:42] well imagine
[1:02:43] how some of us talk
[1:02:47] if they wrote our words down
[1:02:50] y'all
[1:02:53] what y'all mean
[1:03:00] and they're trying to discern the word
[1:03:01] of god
[1:03:03] by y'all or not
[1:03:08] and then they wonder why they're no
[1:03:09] closer to god 40 years later
[1:03:11] than when they started
[1:03:14] what they needed to do was submit
[1:03:17] to the lord and say lord
[1:03:20] open my eyes
[1:03:23] open my ears
[1:03:25] lord reveal yourself to me
[1:03:28] you see my brother and sister what it
[1:03:30] comes down to is we have the option to
[1:03:32] either have the description of jesus
[1:03:34] christ or to have jesus christ
[1:03:40] and did you know that they contain
[1:03:42] technology now that they can project a
[1:03:44] hologram
[1:03:45] that is so real that people will walk up
[1:03:47] and greet it
[1:03:51] now you wonder where that come from
[1:03:54] people think they're serving god
[1:03:56] but it's satan projecting the hologram
[1:04:00] and they say we're christians too
[1:04:03] i don't want the description
[1:04:05] i want christ
[1:04:07] that's what we want
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] so you look for that
[1:04:13] amen i love how
[1:04:15] our brother stephen i
[1:04:16] keep didn't you love
[1:04:18] didn't you love brother marcus's
[1:04:20] deal about the chinese and
[1:04:24] i i had to i had to just really
[1:04:26] appreciate that
[1:04:27] they give the real definition to
[1:04:28] copyright
[1:04:30] just copy it right
[1:04:32] amen copy everything just copy it right
[1:04:35] well look my brother and sister we're
[1:04:36] not here
[1:04:37] to do
[1:04:38] copyright we're not trying to protect
[1:04:41] the original we just want the original
[1:04:43] we don't need to protect it we don't
[1:04:45] need to stop it from doing in fact we
[1:04:47] want to share the original to everyone
[1:04:49] we want everyone to have a host of this
[1:04:51] original word and not not a spirit or
[1:04:54] form of godliness but to really have
[1:04:57] christ
[1:04:58] and brother stephen preaching to us at
[1:05:00] family camp about being daringly foolish
[1:05:03] to follow the leadership of the holy
[1:05:06] ghost my brother and sister i'm telling
[1:05:08] you that is a very very powerful
[1:05:10] statement did you realize he put about
[1:05:12] 50 pounds of tnt behind that when he
[1:05:14] spoke that to us that's how powerful
[1:05:17] that is my brother and sister that we
[1:05:19] could actually become daringly foolish
[1:05:22] to trust god's word
[1:05:24] trust the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:05:26] because when we can come to the place
[1:05:28] that we can trust him then as we read
[1:05:31] and as we pray god said i'll lead you
[1:05:34] and guide you you know this the way i
[1:05:36] read it do you ever read between the
[1:05:37] lines and it looks entirely different
[1:05:39] than what's on the page i look at that
[1:05:41] when god said hey paul if you will just
[1:05:44] submit and follow me i already planted
[1:05:48] this little seed it's so little that you
[1:05:50] in the flesh cannot even find it but i
[1:05:53] will finish this seed that i have
[1:05:56] planted in you and when that seed comes
[1:05:58] to fruit it's not going to be a
[1:06:00] five-fold people like i just hope i can
[1:06:02] just live no my brother and sister i'm
[1:06:04] going to have a hundred-fold increase
[1:06:07] the very seed of the life gene of jesus
[1:06:10] christ and a son or daughter of god is
[1:06:12] not to be measured in some minute
[1:06:15] fashion but we should be looking at the
[1:06:17] amazing grace of god and say i'm gonna
[1:06:20] be the one who yields a hundred fold
[1:06:24] because i am a son of god and my god
[1:06:27] does amazing things
[1:06:29] amen he does powerful things hallelujah
[1:06:33] and look let's just share this here and
[1:06:35] i believe if there was one thing that
[1:06:37] every person in here would long to see
[1:06:39] tonight
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:42] how can i overcome
[1:06:45] how can i overcome brother paul
[1:06:48] one thing we would long to see tonight
[1:06:50] would know
[1:06:51] or truly see the lord jesus appear here
[1:06:54] at the platform or something in person
[1:06:57] and that's our greatest anticipation of
[1:06:59] waiting his coming
[1:07:01] someday he will return
[1:07:03] and we will see him i say amen
[1:07:05] until that time he's with us in spirit
[1:07:09] form
[1:07:10] now look my brother and sister i i'm i'm
[1:07:13] i'm thrilled i'm thrilled if i don't
[1:07:15] have a case of vertigo and fall off the
[1:07:17] platform i'll tell you i'm thrilled
[1:07:20] i'm thrilled that god
[1:07:22] would love me enough
[1:07:23] to send his spirit
[1:07:26] down my way
[1:07:29] not that we just talk about there's a
[1:07:31] holy spirit
[1:07:32] not just somebody professes i've got a
[1:07:34] holy spirit but god could love me and
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:39] so much
[1:07:41] that he would send the holy spirit
[1:07:44] our way
[1:07:47] you know that's christ himself
[1:07:51] people say well i believe i have the
[1:07:52] holy spirit knocked like a bow saw
[1:07:55] no i'm sorry unless you can make a good
[1:07:57] case before the court for uh
[1:08:00] you know
[1:08:02] righteous indignation
[1:08:05] um spiritual obligation to correct
[1:08:07] everyone
[1:08:10] you know unless you can make a superior
[1:08:11] case
[1:08:12] it applies to us
[1:08:14] it's christ himself has come down
[1:08:17] if we could just catch that my brother
[1:08:19] and sister and realize that's not
[1:08:20] religion
[1:08:21] it's not coming to church and the
[1:08:22] preacher preaching to us this is jesus
[1:08:24] christ himself having come down in our
[1:08:26] midst saying i want to talk to you i
[1:08:28] want to dwell with you i want to
[1:08:30] influence your life
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:33] excuse me for getting excited
[1:08:36] but i've been holding it in for a while
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] he's with us in spirit form
[1:08:42] and he only has hands
[1:08:45] as we yield our hands
[1:08:49] he only has eyes as we yield our eyes
[1:08:53] a voice as we yield our voice to him and
[1:08:56] we become a complete yielded vessel
[1:08:59] then the holy spirit speaks through us
[1:09:06] you want to see the time you want to
[1:09:07] kick the devil out of the house
[1:09:09] you want to kick him out of the car you
[1:09:10] want to kick him out of your life
[1:09:13] submit amen
[1:09:15] there's the answer we're like i prayed a
[1:09:16] lot i studied the message i i this i did
[1:09:19] that my way we've done everything my
[1:09:21] brother and sister but submit
[1:09:23] and what god wants us to do is submit
[1:09:26] that we can become a complete yielded
[1:09:29] vessel
[1:09:30] amen you'll find that as synonymous a
[1:09:33] synonym is that right a synonym
[1:09:35] was submitted is yielded
[1:09:38] one in the same
[1:09:40] so you want to become a completely
[1:09:43] submitted
[1:09:44] vessel
[1:09:48] well i'll have you to know i'm an
[1:09:49] american
[1:09:51] good i'm glad
[1:09:53] i have to say
[1:09:55] i was born and raised in this more or
[1:09:57] less in this valley
[1:09:58] well actually i guess it was sis wasn't
[1:10:00] i was born right in the hospital right
[1:10:02] here old hospital that's gone now
[1:10:04] but my parents lived on a farm in oregon
[1:10:08] this has been my world right here
[1:10:11] and nobody's gonna make me change
[1:10:19] until
[1:10:22] the leadership of the holy spirit comes
[1:10:24] down starts to touch us
[1:10:28] life gets difficult you know what most
[1:10:29] of us think the lord's gonna call me
[1:10:31] into submission to him by making my life
[1:10:34] all chocolate gravy and biscuits
[1:10:40] but did you know that god actually turns
[1:10:43] that completely around
[1:10:45] and he starts
[1:10:47] tearing down
[1:10:48] our stronghold
[1:10:51] starts tearing down our will
[1:10:53] starts tearing things down until we come
[1:10:56] to the place that we might think we're
[1:10:58] losing our mind
[1:11:01] and god says don't worry about it i've
[1:11:02] got you
[1:11:04] i've got you but we've got to get you to
[1:11:06] a place you're willing to quit looking
[1:11:09] at yourself
[1:11:10] let's take a little poll here this
[1:11:12] morning
[1:11:13] how many of you
[1:11:14] are i can fix it
[1:11:18] yeah well i'm glad there's no more hands
[1:11:20] some of you just are simply sitting on
[1:11:22] your hands and don't want to put out the
[1:11:23] effort to pull it out and lift it
[1:11:26] you see you're the worst kind
[1:11:30] you're the greatest of transgressor
[1:11:38] no actually you're the one that's going
[1:11:39] to struggle the most
[1:11:42] because little things happen in life and
[1:11:44] your thought is i can fix it
[1:11:48] oh things are not going so good i guess
[1:11:50] i need to double down and fix
[1:11:52] this
[1:11:54] ah my children aren't behaving right
[1:11:56] they have kind of spirit of rebellion i
[1:11:59] i'm going to take away their phone i'm
[1:12:00] going to take away the computer i'm
[1:12:02] going to take away this i'm going to
[1:12:03] take away that you know make them stand
[1:12:05] at 15 in the corner like they were
[1:12:07] five-year-olds i'm gonna fix this and
[1:12:09] then all you do is feed the spirit of
[1:12:11] rebellion because they're like my
[1:12:13] parents aren't gonna treat me like this
[1:12:17] what do we do
[1:12:19] start with yourself parent
[1:12:22] submit yourself first
[1:12:26] because it's in the nature of our young
[1:12:28] people of our children to look and say
[1:12:31] i will be or i will not be like my
[1:12:34] parent
[1:12:38] amen ever felt like you were the oddball
[1:12:41] maybe you come from a family of drunks
[1:12:42] and you want to serve the lord
[1:12:45] or you come from a family that served
[1:12:46] the lord
[1:12:48] and you want to be a drunk
[1:12:51] how is it
[1:12:53] you've got to decide where you're
[1:12:54] submitting to
[1:12:56] you've got to decide how that's working
[1:12:58] amen and so as it is that we become a
[1:13:01] completely yielded vessel then the holy
[1:13:03] spirit my brother and sister we don't
[1:13:05] need to quote here krishna we don't need
[1:13:08] to find advice on some 1-800 number talk
[1:13:11] to a psychic first 15 minutes is free
[1:13:14] and it's a hundred dollars a minute
[1:13:15] after that
[1:13:17] no we don't need that my brother and
[1:13:18] sister what we need is a submission
[1:13:21] amen we've got to come to the place that
[1:13:23] we say you know what lord i just i just
[1:13:25] want to do what you want me to do lord
[1:13:27] i'm willing father if you send me here i
[1:13:29] go without a question amen oh my brother
[1:13:33] and sister can you say i want to be
[1:13:35] completely a yielded vessel today amen
[1:13:38] that's my heart's desires i was studying
[1:13:40] this last night this morning it's like
[1:13:42] lord help me i don't want to just preach
[1:13:44] this to the church i want to be this i
[1:13:47] want to be this person that i don't just
[1:13:49] as a preacher say you need to do this
[1:13:52] but my heart was crying out lord i need
[1:13:55] to do this i need to be this man
[1:13:58] lord let me live by and and be an
[1:14:01] example
[1:14:02] amen that somebody say hey he's
[1:14:04] practicing what he's preaching
[1:14:07] yeah
[1:14:08] oh look at this completely yielded
[1:14:11] vessel
[1:14:12] what a position of strength
[1:14:15] what a position of strength my brother
[1:14:16] and sister to be completely yielded now
[1:14:18] we're not talking boastful in the flesh
[1:14:20] but be completely yielded to god and
[1:14:23] then you get up in the morning and you
[1:14:25] get to live
[1:14:26] life to the fullest
[1:14:30] people are like well i'm afraid of this
[1:14:32] i'm afraid of that i'm afraid of what's
[1:14:34] happening in the world
[1:14:36] my brothers and sisters there's no need
[1:14:38] to be afraid of that
[1:14:39] be completely yielded
[1:14:42] completely yielded i remember years ago
[1:14:44] there was a little wave went through the
[1:14:45] countryside and at that time i wasn't i
[1:14:47] was ministering some but not pastoring
[1:14:49] the church and it seemed like the the
[1:14:51] freight loads were going to california
[1:14:54] all the time i went to los angeles so
[1:14:56] many times i had the road i could almost
[1:14:58] drive it in my sleep and going down
[1:15:00] there and had to had somebody come to me
[1:15:01] and say brother paul
[1:15:03] are aren't you afraid of going to
[1:15:05] california and i was like why would i be
[1:15:08] my mind's going like are they in forcing
[1:15:10] some new law
[1:15:12] is my old truck not going to be good
[1:15:13] enough to go there what what
[1:15:15] and they're like no the prophet said
[1:15:17] california is falling in the ocean and
[1:15:19] then you should be afraid to go there
[1:15:22] and i said oh but brother let me tell
[1:15:25] you something if i'm there when it falls
[1:15:28] in the ocean i've got a bigger problem
[1:15:30] than that
[1:15:31] hallelujah because i'm not afraid of
[1:15:34] these things that's going on around us
[1:15:37] amen you know from russia they are one
[1:15:39] of the the man made a statement america
[1:15:42] should be afraid of what's coming to it
[1:15:45] and we have a prophetic word declaring
[1:15:47] what's coming to america but i'm not
[1:15:49] afraid because i don't plan on being
[1:15:53] here because i'll spend my time now
[1:15:55] submitting to the word of god submitting
[1:15:58] my life to christ i'll submit myself and
[1:16:00] when the moment comes and he calls the
[1:16:03] word
[1:16:04] home we're thinking he's going to call
[1:16:07] me home
[1:16:10] you realize
[1:16:11] a magnet never picks up aluminum
[1:16:15] and the holy ghost cannot redeem
[1:16:16] unbelief
[1:16:20] the magnet only picks up steel
[1:16:23] and the word
[1:16:24] will call the word home
[1:16:26] and the word that is in us
[1:16:29] will take us home
[1:16:31] it ain't going to be how good how much
[1:16:33] we've given what we've done the kind
[1:16:35] words we were compassionate none of that
[1:16:37] will matter
[1:16:38] it would be the word calling the word
[1:16:40] home
[1:16:41] and the word in us is what's going to
[1:16:43] take us out of here because this flesh
[1:16:47] has no good deed in it
[1:16:50] this flesh has no good word in it as far
[1:16:54] as man is concerned let me clarify that
[1:16:56] my brother and sister it's the word of
[1:16:58] god in us when he calls the word home
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:02] the word that's in us takes us home
[1:17:05] oh can you say thank you lord
[1:17:07] so you see then it's not how good we
[1:17:09] were how smart we were how good of works
[1:17:12] we did how much we did of anything it
[1:17:14] will be the deposit of the word in us
[1:17:18] that takes us up out of here
[1:17:20] oh and i tell you everybody from a phd
[1:17:23] down to a high school dropout yes thank
[1:17:26] you lord for including me amen will then
[1:17:28] have the opportunity to go
[1:17:31] because it's all about the word
[1:17:34] not about accomplishments
[1:17:38] what a position of strength
[1:17:41] to have every portion of the word of god
[1:17:44] to back you up
[1:17:47] i just love that
[1:17:51] because i don't want to really get up
[1:17:53] every day
[1:17:56] to walk through life
[1:17:58] and to work
[1:18:00] with a nagging doubt
[1:18:02] in the back of my mind
[1:18:05] am i saved
[1:18:08] well you know the first person to share
[1:18:10] with you you know who he is
[1:18:14] the devil's going to say of course
[1:18:16] you're not saved
[1:18:18] because if you were saved you would be
[1:18:20] perfect
[1:18:23] oh but devil my bible says there's only
[1:18:25] one perfect one
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:29] and i'm glad that by god's grace by his
[1:18:32] mercy
[1:18:33] his life in me
[1:18:35] brings me to a place i can walk and work
[1:18:38] and live life with the full confidence
[1:18:40] of god amen amen isn't it wonderful to
[1:18:44] live in the will of god amen
[1:18:46] hallelujah
[1:18:48] to have a confidence you know my brother
[1:18:50] and sister
[1:18:51] we live in a world today right and
[1:18:53] oftentimes all this stuff is about
[1:18:55] interest going up and people can't buy
[1:18:57] houses and people can't this and people
[1:18:59] can't that and their jobs are hanging by
[1:19:02] a thread you got to just love the new
[1:19:03] service i look at it online sometimes
[1:19:06] not that often because i i just don't
[1:19:08] want to go through this depression stage
[1:19:10] after i look at it
[1:19:12] but they're like everybody's job is at
[1:19:14] jeopardy
[1:19:15] and then literally everywhere i go
[1:19:18] there's a help wanted sign
[1:19:23] whose voice do we listen to
[1:19:27] we listen to the voice of those that say
[1:19:29] well this is not legitimate
[1:19:32] or do we listen to the holy ghost
[1:19:35] that said ah
[1:19:37] don't worry
[1:19:38] i started to work in you
[1:19:41] i sent in the excavator and the
[1:19:43] bulldozer and i took all of the
[1:19:45] overburden of the things and cares of
[1:19:48] life and i pushed it off to one side and
[1:19:51] we'll take that over here in this sea
[1:19:53] that needs filled up and we'll push it
[1:19:55] over into the bottom and then you can
[1:19:58] come now and a liberty and a confidence
[1:20:01] you can come and say i have been
[1:20:04] redeemed amen
[1:20:07] but see if you don't believe you're
[1:20:09] redeemed
[1:20:11] you don't believe that that pushed into
[1:20:13] the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:20:16] you still claim it amen
[1:20:19] my sin
[1:20:21] my unbelief quit talking the devil's
[1:20:23] language
[1:20:24] that never belonged to you
[1:20:26] it never never never was yours
[1:20:31] hallelujah
[1:20:32] amen now look at this
[1:20:35] to be able to walk to work with
[1:20:36] confidence that we're in the will of god
[1:20:38] what a life-changing event that is
[1:20:41] how it changes our life young people you
[1:20:43] can go through high school and whatever
[1:20:46] middle school and high school and
[1:20:47] whatever in the schools of this world
[1:20:49] where they teach all kinds of
[1:20:50] nonsense you can walk through there with
[1:20:52] a confidence this is not my world i'm a
[1:20:56] son or daughter of god and that is going
[1:20:58] to be my position because i have
[1:21:00] confidence in my god when he said he has
[1:21:02] washed away my sin when he said i have
[1:21:04] sealed you to the day of your redemption
[1:21:06] when i said this work i began i will
[1:21:08] finish you can walk through that and not
[1:21:11] waver
[1:21:12] and the devil would like to come and
[1:21:14] challenge you well if you're this then
[1:21:16] you could do this if you're really
[1:21:18] redeemed you can live any way you want
[1:21:19] nonsense
[1:21:21] nonsense that's the devil's religion
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:25] now look my brother and sister you know
[1:21:26] what's so interesting
[1:21:28] have you ever watched a man
[1:21:31] fight as it were against the wind
[1:21:35] you take two men
[1:21:37] both ordinary looking
[1:21:41] maybe a fender bender
[1:21:43] and they're angry
[1:21:45] it's your fault
[1:21:48] one of them's out there
[1:21:50] he's doing this
[1:21:53] and the other guy's like wow
[1:21:57] only two hits
[1:21:59] one in his face and the other one his
[1:22:01] head hitting the ground
[1:22:04] because you got to know how to fight
[1:22:08] brother jason was auxiliary
[1:22:11] uh rcmp
[1:22:13] we don't really like those kind of
[1:22:14] people but they're necessary
[1:22:18] no he used to greet me i'd go to canada
[1:22:20] he'd greet me the next thing i know is
[1:22:23] like can i have my thumb back
[1:22:28] but you see my brother and sister we got
[1:22:29] to know how to fight
[1:22:31] we don't fight satan's fight satan's way
[1:22:35] we fight according to the word
[1:22:37] and when we come according to the word
[1:22:40] the word says you know what if you'll
[1:22:41] submit
[1:22:43] then you'll come to a place in your
[1:22:45] submission
[1:22:46] that you don't have to worry about well
[1:22:48] i don't know if i can deal with the
[1:22:49] devil face to face yes you can
[1:22:51] yes you can just submit to the lord
[1:22:54] and the word that is in deposit in you
[1:22:57] will then rise up and god will anoint
[1:23:00] you to have a word have you ever been in
[1:23:02] that conversation you say well it was so
[1:23:04] interesting i was at work i was here i
[1:23:06] was there somebody said something to me
[1:23:07] i said this i said that and then they're
[1:23:10] asking a question and next thing i know
[1:23:11] i was saying things to them i didn't
[1:23:12] even know i knew
[1:23:19] that's god doing the fighting for you
[1:23:22] that's not you shying away because i
[1:23:24] don't know how to deal with drunks i
[1:23:25] don't know how to do with people with
[1:23:27] addictions i don't know how to deal with
[1:23:28] people with these spirits i don't know
[1:23:29] how to deal with this or that
[1:23:32] no the lord
[1:23:36] in your submission has enabled you now
[1:23:40] to resist the devil
[1:23:42] now i want you to just catch this for a
[1:23:44] moment do you realize that resisting the
[1:23:46] devil's not always a bloody brawl
[1:23:50] sometimes it's cunning spirits trying to
[1:23:52] plant a seed
[1:23:54] coming to lay a little thought in your
[1:23:56] mind
[1:23:57] that they can hopefully water again
[1:24:01] had a man some time back
[1:24:04] tried to plant a whole garden in my mind
[1:24:07] he there saying well you know prophet
[1:24:09] says this prophet says this prophet says
[1:24:11] this prophet says that
[1:24:14] and i thought that's right
[1:24:17] but the word says
[1:24:20] now let's take what prophet said and
[1:24:22] word said you say well they do line up
[1:24:24] brother paul
[1:24:25] but not coming out of every man's mouth
[1:24:27] do they line up
[1:24:30] that's why i don't care how much you
[1:24:31] might like brother paul
[1:24:34] you don't take my word for it
[1:24:36] that's why you've got to
[1:24:38] dig deep
[1:24:42] but it's a lot easier just to believe
[1:24:44] the preacher
[1:24:45] really some of them are anointed wolves
[1:24:48] and sheep clothing
[1:24:50] titles mean nothing
[1:24:52] titles mean
[1:24:53] nothing
[1:24:56] i am
[1:24:57] what i live
[1:25:01] yes someone say amen to that
[1:25:04] yes i am what i live
[1:25:06] now look
[1:25:07] so satan's no longer able to resist the
[1:25:09] word right
[1:25:11] now look at this it is
[1:25:14] we see through the scripture
[1:25:18] was it gamalia that said hey back off
[1:25:20] lest you be fight found fighting
[1:25:22] against god
[1:25:25] you see what's happening i want you to
[1:25:27] see how this is
[1:25:28] satan's anointing in this day it's a
[1:25:30] spirit of this day a religious spirit
[1:25:33] where people don't recognize it but
[1:25:35] literally they've been found fighting
[1:25:37] against the word of god
[1:25:39] they're pushing back they're they're in
[1:25:41] a struggle they're in a resistance
[1:25:43] against the word and so look at the
[1:25:45] ultimate coup on satan's part is to get
[1:25:48] people who want to serve god to fight
[1:25:50] and push back against the word
[1:25:54] they say no i love the lord with all of
[1:25:55] my heart but you see how clever and
[1:25:57] cunning satan is is they don't even
[1:25:59] realize he brings us in a position we
[1:26:02] don't even realize that we are actually
[1:26:04] pushing against the word of god we're
[1:26:06] resisting amen
[1:26:10] the devil says hey
[1:26:12] i don't need to deceive you you can have
[1:26:14] all of this message that you want you
[1:26:16] can have all the church experience you
[1:26:18] want all the revival you want but as
[1:26:21] long as you're fighting against the word
[1:26:23] of god and pushing back and you know
[1:26:26] oftentimes saints i hope this doesn't
[1:26:28] offend or hurt anyone often times it
[1:26:30] might be a hurt it might be a little
[1:26:32] something from our youth or a
[1:26:34] circumstance in our life and it's
[1:26:36] brutally painful for us it's something
[1:26:38] we don't want to face it's not like we
[1:26:41] even want to pull it out of the closet
[1:26:43] or out of the safe to deal with it and
[1:26:45] so we push back against the word to not
[1:26:48] have to deal with that when we should
[1:26:50] come because full submission is us
[1:26:53] opening our whole life to christ and
[1:26:55] saying lord take control
[1:26:57] take control lord i can't do it any
[1:27:00] longer
[1:27:02] and to realize that little something a
[1:27:04] seed planted see how clever and patient
[1:27:06] satan is
[1:27:08] there's certain things satan comes
[1:27:10] it's what the world's doing today i'm
[1:27:12] not going to go into it but all this
[1:27:13] perversion they're teaching in school
[1:27:15] they're planting seeds
[1:27:19] and a child comes home
[1:27:21] and says oh mom and dad they were
[1:27:22] teaching us about this now children
[1:27:24] that's wrong
[1:27:26] but the seed
[1:27:28] has been planted
[1:27:33] why does the pastor preach so hard
[1:27:35] he's trying to scorch the earth
[1:27:37] that that other seed
[1:27:39] was planted in
[1:27:41] and then children grow up and say well
[1:27:44] i don't know why i guess i'm just like i
[1:27:46] am and this is what i think i am now
[1:27:49] not realizing it was a devil planted
[1:27:51] that seed
[1:27:52] in their childhood
[1:27:55] and then every commercial
[1:27:57] every deal i was watching a little
[1:27:58] documentary the other day
[1:28:00] and uh in that
[1:28:03] oh well i hope this doesn't offend
[1:28:05] anyone and i hope it doesn't hurt the
[1:28:06] world out there too much you know
[1:28:11] advertisement
[1:28:13] two men
[1:28:15] sitting on a lounge chair
[1:28:16] on a patio with their arms around each
[1:28:18] other
[1:28:20] drinking tea
[1:28:22] i can assure you i'll never buy that tea
[1:28:25] if they would spend their advertising
[1:28:27] dollars on two men hugging each other
[1:28:30] intimating this this deal as it's okay
[1:28:33] because something about the tea makes
[1:28:35] everything better
[1:28:37] it's a seed
[1:28:40] and if they're willing to support that
[1:28:43] well i don't think drink tea anyway but
[1:28:45] you never know because i said i'd never
[1:28:46] drink coffee
[1:28:48] but
[1:28:49] you see what's happening they've
[1:28:51] embraced it satan's anointed them they
[1:28:53] plant the seed for every person who's
[1:28:55] watching national geographic
[1:28:58] and you think oh we clicked beyond that
[1:29:00] our kids no no
[1:29:02] no no no
[1:29:04] the devil knows what he's doing we'll
[1:29:06] give him that much credit
[1:29:08] he's planting a seed so it's there my
[1:29:11] brother and sister we do not want to be
[1:29:13] found fighting against the word of god
[1:29:16] and you say well brother paul i don't
[1:29:17] believe i have anything in my life that
[1:29:19] i'm fighting do you have a rebellious
[1:29:20] spirit
[1:29:21] or have a submissive spirit amen
[1:29:24] does the word have to be preached to you
[1:29:26] in a certain fashion to make you happy
[1:29:28] or can it just be preached
[1:29:31] do you receive it if it hurts
[1:29:35] or if it makes you shout
[1:29:37] these are all signs of submission saints
[1:29:40] should not be able to offend the bride
[1:29:42] of christ
[1:29:44] she can take it back to the word and say
[1:29:46] the word is true then lord help me
[1:29:48] change me lord
[1:29:51] now look at this
[1:29:52] when we are found fighting against the
[1:29:54] word we have to be really careful about
[1:29:56] what we say and do remember the prophet
[1:29:58] of god said don't be found speaking the
[1:29:59] devil's language
[1:30:01] and so what we want to do and i say that
[1:30:03] i support that at all but i want to add
[1:30:05] or kind of put to this if i could i want
[1:30:07] to say how about we kind of bring also
[1:30:10] that let's not do the devil's fighting
[1:30:11] for him
[1:30:16] people are like well
[1:30:17] you know brother so-and-so him and his
[1:30:19] family
[1:30:20] they did us wrong 27 and a half years
[1:30:22] ago and i remember every word of the
[1:30:24] conversation
[1:30:26] really
[1:30:28] 27 and a half year
[1:30:30] career working for the devil
[1:30:33] not difference of opinion i'm sorry see
[1:30:35] we've sugar-coated these things
[1:30:38] as they're just differences of opinion
[1:30:39] or a difference of personality no we've
[1:30:42] been doing the devil's work
[1:30:45] you've got an axe to grind why don't you
[1:30:46] grind it and repent with them
[1:30:49] and put it behind you
[1:30:51] and then both of you can grow
[1:30:52] spiritually
[1:30:55] i don't want to do the devil's fighting
[1:30:56] for him
[1:30:57] amen
[1:31:00] he's even anointing my ipad
[1:31:06] yeah
[1:31:06] excuse me
[1:31:08] now in identified masterpiece
[1:31:10] look what the prophet of god said
[1:31:12] he was wounded for our transgression he
[1:31:14] was bruised for our iniquity he was a
[1:31:16] lamb the lamb of god the perfect
[1:31:18] sacrifice there was never nobody lived
[1:31:21] like him never as nobody since lived
[1:31:23] like him he was a perfect masterpiece
[1:31:26] matched god's word exactly god in the
[1:31:28] beginning gave his word a portion for
[1:31:30] this part of the time and for that part
[1:31:34] and for that part this is where men are
[1:31:36] so deceived and confused today they're
[1:31:39] trying to build on something that
[1:31:41] happened 40 50 years ago where that that
[1:31:44] was give for that age oh now i'll tell
[1:31:47] you what you want to pick a fight with
[1:31:48] some people you just quote that and then
[1:31:50] stand and i encourage you read before
[1:31:52] and read afterwards i'm not cherry
[1:31:54] picking this but my brother and sister
[1:31:56] i'm telling you i'm not looking for
[1:31:58] something that happened 50 or 60 or 70
[1:32:00] years ago because i have a prophetic
[1:32:03] word
[1:32:04] that come in this day that said this is
[1:32:07] the work that god is going to do before
[1:32:10] the coming of the lord and these things
[1:32:13] will take place and there'll be a people
[1:32:15] that will be fulfilling this word and i
[1:32:18] believe that i am one of those people
[1:32:21] and so i can't look back do we do away
[1:32:24] with the message no
[1:32:26] not long ago i had somebody tell me you
[1:32:29] are leaving brother branham behind
[1:32:37] eliezer
[1:32:39] we're on our honeymoon would you like to
[1:32:40] live in our tent with us
[1:32:44] awkward
[1:32:47] awkward
[1:32:49] the prophet of god even said that they
[1:32:52] were a type
[1:32:55] hey
[1:32:57] what happened when the work was done
[1:33:00] the word was given
[1:33:02] life was meant to be
[1:33:07] you conceived if the prophet was here
[1:33:09] today
[1:33:12] call waiting
[1:33:14] for your credit card company would seem
[1:33:16] like nothing compared to trying calling
[1:33:18] him
[1:33:20] should i buy a car is it wrong to wear
[1:33:22] red to church
[1:33:24] what about this is it evil to drive a
[1:33:26] black car
[1:33:29] oh come on
[1:33:31] if you can ever get brother george to
[1:33:33] open up he don't usually but he'll tell
[1:33:37] you some stories that you'd be like no
[1:33:38] people can't be that stupid
[1:33:41] oh did i use that word i'm sorry
[1:33:46] you see i'm actually glad
[1:33:49] that by the anointing of god's word
[1:33:51] we've moved on
[1:33:54] oh some people they won't like this they
[1:33:56] flinch over this but i'm glad that the
[1:33:58] revelation that's coming to grace
[1:34:00] tabernacle is not someone explaining
[1:34:04] this message to us but it is god himself
[1:34:07] coming down and speaking lip to ear and
[1:34:10] speaking to the hearts of sons and
[1:34:12] daughters of god because this is what he
[1:34:14] intended for us to come into maturity
[1:34:17] imagine saints now pardon me i'm not
[1:34:19] making light of this but imagine if you
[1:34:21] know all the problems of our life we
[1:34:23] could pick up a telephone brother
[1:34:24] branham what should i do i believe he
[1:34:27] would come to the time he'd tell you go
[1:34:29] back to the word and pray about it
[1:34:32] because you've got to come
[1:34:35] to maturity
[1:34:38] you can't
[1:34:39] as a man to his son you cannot
[1:34:41] constantly go say son here give me the
[1:34:44] wrenches oh son give me the hammer son
[1:34:47] give me this son give me that you just
[1:34:49] stand and watch
[1:34:50] there comes a season that any man does
[1:34:52] justice to his son he says son there it
[1:34:55] is this is a wrench i'll point out you
[1:34:58] want to take the manifold off you got to
[1:34:59] start here oh yes you got to start here
[1:35:04] amen and you got to unloose the things
[1:35:06] of bondage in your life and then when
[1:35:09] you go to put it back together don't
[1:35:11] recycle those parts put new parts in
[1:35:14] there and if it says to tighten it down
[1:35:17] to so many foot pounds tighten it to so
[1:35:19] many foot pounds and if it says do this
[1:35:22] to bleed it then do that to do it and my
[1:35:25] brother and sister i'm taking this back
[1:35:27] to the point it says submit yourself
[1:35:31] submit yourself don't skip beyond that
[1:35:34] oh i got a youtube video i've got a
[1:35:37] preacher in texas that he says god's
[1:35:40] gonna bless me so i've already ordered
[1:35:42] my new mercedes and only have 10 bucks
[1:35:44] in the bank
[1:35:46] no my god says that you should come to
[1:35:49] an accounting whether you can afford it
[1:35:51] or not and then be a good steward of the
[1:35:54] blessings of god not to live in an image
[1:35:57] of something else and listen to what the
[1:35:59] world says but god said i want you to
[1:36:02] come let me be the center point let me
[1:36:05] be your leadership and i want you to
[1:36:07] look to me i want your vision to be me
[1:36:10] not someone else
[1:36:13] oh i'll tell you what the problem we
[1:36:15] have my brother and sister is we get
[1:36:17] images raised up in our own mind no
[1:36:19] preachers like nor preacher nobody's
[1:36:21] like this person nobody's like that
[1:36:23] where did you leave god
[1:36:26] where did you leave god
[1:36:29] oh
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:32] what was it
[1:36:34] not looking back
[1:36:36] come on
[1:36:37] amen this is the same message
[1:36:40] actually it's not the same message as
[1:36:42] when the prophet left the scene believe
[1:36:43] it or not
[1:36:45] don't want to shake anybody up but it's
[1:36:46] not the same message when the prophet of
[1:36:48] god left the scene
[1:36:50] the prophet himself left the words
[1:36:52] as a parting gift to us
[1:36:55] to wait on the lord amen
[1:36:57] and pray
[1:36:59] for revelation
[1:37:01] amen now if he thought all revelation
[1:37:04] was contained in those sermons those
[1:37:07] messages that he preached why would he
[1:37:09] tell us
[1:37:10] pray
[1:37:11] for revelation
[1:37:14] because he knew there was much more
[1:37:15] coming to us
[1:37:17] god was going to open it up why because
[1:37:19] this bride has to come to a place she's
[1:37:22] a final voice
[1:37:24] to a final age
[1:37:27] and you realize we might still be saying
[1:37:29] prophet said this prophet said that
[1:37:32] but you realize you catch this saint
[1:37:35] something's happening maybe you don't
[1:37:36] even recognize your own vocabulary
[1:37:40] we're starting to speak of what god has
[1:37:42] done
[1:37:43] for us
[1:37:46] it's not all about looking back
[1:37:49] god did this for them and for them and
[1:37:51] for them
[1:37:52] but we're now able to stand on our own
[1:37:55] two feet and say god did this for me
[1:37:59] what is this this is the manifested
[1:38:01] prophetic message of our day coming
[1:38:04] forward
[1:38:05] bringing us to a place
[1:38:07] we can be
[1:38:08] the final voice
[1:38:10] to the final age
[1:38:12] hallelujah
[1:38:15] a couple more minutes
[1:38:17] amen
[1:38:18] i'll tell you what see
[1:38:20] what happened
[1:38:23] two polar opposite opinions
[1:38:26] in the message
[1:38:28] prophet of god saying read between the
[1:38:29] lines and other people saying if you
[1:38:31] read between the lines you're adding to
[1:38:33] the word now who are you going to
[1:38:34] believe
[1:38:37] my prophet said read between the lines
[1:38:38] and as i read between the lines the word
[1:38:40] is just expanding
[1:38:42] because you see it's the same message my
[1:38:44] brother and sister but it's manifesting
[1:38:46] itself today
[1:38:47] there was a port a point
[1:38:50] a part
[1:38:51] of the word
[1:38:52] that said when you see all these things
[1:38:54] coming to pass
[1:38:58] go back through the message
[1:39:00] prophet of god talking about russia
[1:39:03] the iron curtain
[1:39:04] communism
[1:39:06] all of these things
[1:39:09] right now saints
[1:39:12] we could look at that and say oh my
[1:39:16] but what did he say
[1:39:18] look out for
[1:39:21] did he say watch out for the iron
[1:39:22] curtain
[1:39:24] no he said watch out for the purple
[1:39:26] curtain
[1:39:29] have you heard much from her in the news
[1:39:31] lately
[1:39:35] have you ever heard of that phrase
[1:39:37] called distraction
[1:39:41] the world's
[1:39:42] looking
[1:39:43] for the next nuclear
[1:39:45] explosion the next
[1:39:47] conquering army
[1:39:49] the next collapsing economy
[1:39:52] now
[1:39:53] don't misunderstand me my heart goes out
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:55] and brother barry's doing a wonderful
[1:39:57] work and helping and they're now trying
[1:39:59] to work towards this and our brother
[1:40:01] sergey is is very much informed helping
[1:40:04] do certain things but you look at this
[1:40:07] my brother and sister
[1:40:08] now it's the coming winter what are we
[1:40:09] going to do to help the believers
[1:40:11] and then the whole populous what are we
[1:40:13] going to do the coming winter
[1:40:16] and our heart breaks
[1:40:18] but what you really need to be looking
[1:40:20] for
[1:40:22] is that other spirit
[1:40:25] the one that's going to come in and it's
[1:40:26] going to conquer souls while they live
[1:40:29] in comfort
[1:40:30] while they live in the unity and joy of
[1:40:34] life and they're there being conquered
[1:40:40] amen don't be afraid of the one that can
[1:40:42] take your life
[1:40:45] yeah
[1:40:46] don't be afraid of that one
[1:40:48] be afraid of the one that can take your
[1:40:50] soul
[1:40:51] the second death is what we have to
[1:40:53] worry about
[1:40:54] hallelujah see what happens is my
[1:40:56] brother and sister if you submit
[1:40:59] well it's so hard i'll admit look i'll
[1:41:01] just sit down right here and just tell
[1:41:03] you it's it's hard
[1:41:05] it's hard to submit
[1:41:08] this will this will of we have that god
[1:41:10] placed in us
[1:41:12] you know it just constantly rises up
[1:41:15] it constantly just shows its face amen
[1:41:18] so that way i actually say thank you
[1:41:20] lord because imagine what kind of
[1:41:22] christians we'd be
[1:41:23] if we finally conquered
[1:41:27] everything's underneath my feet
[1:41:41] i heard some believers once say well
[1:41:43] it's come down to this
[1:41:45] movies are good
[1:41:48] bad and worst
[1:41:53] i've also had believers tell me can you
[1:41:55] show me in the scripture definitively
[1:41:58] where it's wrong for us to drink wine
[1:42:04] i can show you but you won't believe it
[1:42:05] because you need something that's got
[1:42:07] your name on it
[1:42:09] that's what they mean by definitively
[1:42:11] you know be like fred don't drink wine
[1:42:14] but a little wine is good for our
[1:42:15] belly's sake isn't it
[1:42:17] we cannot deny that
[1:42:20] so scripturally you could go home and
[1:42:21] take a sip of wine and not be out of the
[1:42:23] will of god
[1:42:25] except for when you went home the devil
[1:42:27] was sitting on the chair next to your
[1:42:29] little
[1:42:30] cabinet where you kept the wine
[1:42:32] and i really do need to feel better
[1:42:38] and if one is good
[1:42:40] you know the old phrase
[1:42:42] if one is good two
[1:42:45] is better
[1:42:47] and if two is good three is best
[1:42:52] how slippery the devil is
[1:42:55] it might be lawful but is it expedient
[1:42:59] so we come to this place my brother and
[1:43:00] sister we have to decide do i really
[1:43:03] need these little things of the flesh to
[1:43:06] make me happy when god has come and said
[1:43:09] if i'll submit to his holy spirit that
[1:43:11] he'll fill all things he will bring me
[1:43:14] through he will lead me he'll be my
[1:43:15] comforter he'll be my guide he'll be my
[1:43:17] everything
[1:43:19] or i need to just not submit this one
[1:43:22] little portion of my life
[1:43:24] one little portion that i i need to just
[1:43:26] hold back for my own pleasure
[1:43:31] preach to yourself paul
[1:43:37] you see what i want this message to be
[1:43:39] manifested today
[1:43:41] i don't want us church looking back
[1:43:42] grace tabernacle don't be looking back
[1:43:44] we're looking right here to this day and
[1:43:46] we are looking forward and every promise
[1:43:48] of the word of god that was meant for
[1:43:50] the end time was meant for you and i we
[1:43:52] don't have to go back to find it it's
[1:43:55] here being manifested right now in our
[1:43:58] presence
[1:43:59] amen and people say i don't see it well
[1:44:01] submit yourself and god will open your
[1:44:03] eyes so that your eyes will be his eyes
[1:44:06] or his eyes will be your eyes and hands
[1:44:09] will be hands and feet will be feet you
[1:44:11] don't have to go back there to try and
[1:44:13] recreate something when god said i'm
[1:44:16] going to make that come to pass in the
[1:44:17] end time and not in a great man rose up
[1:44:20] but in you
[1:44:22] in you hallelujah
[1:44:24] oh let me hurry along here in the sermon
[1:44:26] fellowship
[1:44:27] he says but father god
[1:44:31] let us in our lifetime
[1:44:33] so nothing
[1:44:34] but the genuine seed of god
[1:44:37] therefore when the spirit comes
[1:44:40] and falls upon it
[1:44:43] it may bring forth
[1:44:47] a copyright
[1:44:52] the original
[1:44:54] he says reproduction
[1:44:58] but if you take
[1:45:01] the seed
[1:45:02] from an unhybrid plant
[1:45:06] and you put it in the ground and it
[1:45:08] grows again
[1:45:10] it will be
[1:45:11] a perfect reproduction
[1:45:18] give you all agronomy lesson real quick
[1:45:20] did you realize
[1:45:22] unfortunately i do grow some hybrid
[1:45:24] crops
[1:45:25] i don't feel unmessaged when i do that
[1:45:30] but did you know
[1:45:31] that hybrid plants
[1:45:33] have what they call a regressive gene
[1:45:38] and if you plant that plant
[1:45:41] take the seed
[1:45:43] plant that seed
[1:45:45] that plant comes to maturity you take
[1:45:47] that seed plant that seed it comes to
[1:45:50] maturity
[1:45:51] every
[1:45:52] following generation
[1:45:55] is reverting back
[1:45:58] to
[1:45:59] the original not hybrid seed you planted
[1:46:03] but beyond that
[1:46:05] regressive
[1:46:08] the prophet of god says
[1:46:11] you give enough time
[1:46:13] this pentecostal church
[1:46:15] will be worse
[1:46:17] than the others
[1:46:21] and i'll just leave it as homework for
[1:46:22] you to look for yourself the prophet of
[1:46:24] god coming down hammering on this spirit
[1:46:27] of denomination
[1:46:28] and then he said
[1:46:31] branham tabernacle
[1:46:34] you're just as bad
[1:46:35] as they are amen
[1:46:38] i had to have hurt
[1:46:41] and even today it probably would hurt
[1:46:42] some people's feelings
[1:46:44] but what is it my brother and sister
[1:46:47] without coming to that place
[1:46:49] that full surrender complete submission
[1:46:53] and being filled with the holy ghost
[1:46:55] we're just a seed
[1:46:57] regressing
[1:46:58] the prophet went on to say the lutherans
[1:47:00] will become
[1:47:01] back to lutheran
[1:47:03] wesley back to wesley
[1:47:06] and that was good
[1:47:07] let me tie this
[1:47:09] that was good
[1:47:11] for those days back there
[1:47:14] but it won't work
[1:47:16] today
[1:47:18] i want overcoming power today
[1:47:20] i don't want to talk about how luther
[1:47:22] did what luther did had the courage to
[1:47:24] go post the thesis on the door my
[1:47:26] brother and sister i don't want to talk
[1:47:27] about how john wesley did what john
[1:47:29] wesley did or anyone else that is there
[1:47:32] i want to talk about what the holy ghost
[1:47:33] has done today done in me done in my
[1:47:36] wife done in my children done in my
[1:47:38] grandchildren
[1:47:39] today
[1:47:41] hallelujah
[1:47:42] okay let's close this i have i have
[1:47:45] several more things here
[1:47:46] amen i want i do want to share hebrews
[1:47:50] 2 and 11 with you
[1:47:53] look at this
[1:47:54] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:47:57] who are sanctified
[1:47:59] are all one
[1:48:01] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:48:03] call them brethren
[1:48:04] in this interesting that when you become
[1:48:06] sanctified which we know is not the end
[1:48:10] but that's when christ puts that mark on
[1:48:13] you
[1:48:14] what do we do
[1:48:16] sons and daughters of god move on
[1:48:18] something happened
[1:48:21] come on i don't mean to embarrass
[1:48:22] anybody or do but
[1:48:24] it's sometimes as
[1:48:26] somebody talks about well the old church
[1:48:28] i remember the old church there was this
[1:48:29] lady showed up to church there she come
[1:48:32] sit right on the front row
[1:48:33] she didn't hide in the back she came
[1:48:35] right to the front row
[1:48:36] and by god's grace
[1:48:38] got to see the holy ghost come down and
[1:48:40] touch that lady
[1:48:42] and change her life
[1:48:46] you don't hear her saying
[1:48:49] i wish i was back here
[1:48:52] no sir what i do here
[1:48:54] is her saying
[1:48:55] i want more
[1:48:57] i want more
[1:48:59] thank you lord for what you've given me
[1:49:00] but i want more
[1:49:03] and to get more we have to submit
[1:49:06] and as we submit god pours in more
[1:49:09] and as we take the word and act and live
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:12] word we suddenly say how can i overcome
[1:49:17] i think i found a key
[1:49:19] to overcoming power
[1:49:21] the prophet of god said just as it was
[1:49:24] i must
[1:49:26] decrease that he can
[1:49:28] increase that was only for them right
[1:49:32] no it's for us
[1:49:34] i must decrease
[1:49:36] you must decrease
[1:49:39] that he
[1:49:40] can increase
[1:49:42] hallelujah
[1:49:44] oh my
[1:49:48] can i read one last quote
[1:49:51] jehovah jireh
[1:49:53] amen to me it's just an exciting quote
[1:49:56] i read this
[1:49:57] oh i don't know
[1:49:59] it's been back a week week or more ago
[1:50:01] or something that just struck
[1:50:03] struck me very much
[1:50:04] god appeared to abraham as el shaddai
[1:50:08] for the forgiveness of sins and healing
[1:50:10] of the body el shaddai the breasted one
[1:50:14] jesus was wounded for our transgression
[1:50:16] with his stripes we are healed
[1:50:19] we can take
[1:50:20] from either source
[1:50:24] a little confusing there in a way isn't
[1:50:26] it but it's telling if you go over here
[1:50:28] and you make identification with el
[1:50:29] shaddai
[1:50:31] you've got the same exact identification
[1:50:34] as you have with jesus christ
[1:50:38] not one
[1:50:39] first part second part third part
[1:50:43] one bit of no sir it was god
[1:50:47] it was god
[1:50:48] you'd be surprised how many people freak
[1:50:50] out over that
[1:50:53] we can take from either
[1:50:55] resource amen oh my when christians
[1:50:57] begin to get that
[1:51:02] you guys aren't responding like i want
[1:51:04] you to
[1:51:11] what resource
[1:51:15] prophet of god said you read this bible
[1:51:17] if you don't see jesus christ in every
[1:51:20] word
[1:51:22] okay
[1:51:23] y'all got your spiritual goggles
[1:51:26] we put them on
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:29] you know
[1:51:30] christians have night vision goggles
[1:51:33] we live in the darkness
[1:51:35] we're not of the darkness
[1:51:38] and the light is magnified and we see
[1:51:41] the light
[1:51:42] even though satan said if i get it dark
[1:51:44] enough nobody will be able to see god
[1:51:46] says
[1:51:47] i've given them
[1:51:48] spiritual
[1:51:50] eyesight
[1:51:53] i hope this doesn't offend anybody
[1:51:55] you can take it from either source you
[1:51:56] want
[1:51:57] either resource i can take it from here
[1:52:02] or with the holy ghost anointing
[1:52:04] i can pick up the message
[1:52:08] and be blessed
[1:52:09] this
[1:52:10] is not a replacement
[1:52:12] for this
[1:52:14] but it's a resource
[1:52:16] that speaks of this
[1:52:18] breaks this down explains this not like
[1:52:20] a teacher teaching
[1:52:22] but by the anointing of revelation
[1:52:24] making it real to us
[1:52:27] and we're
[1:52:29] is that there
[1:52:29] acceptable analogy
[1:52:32] el shaddai
[1:52:34] nothing but god himself
[1:52:36] jesus christ god himself
[1:52:39] and so it's there you can take for me
[1:52:41] the resource and when
[1:52:43] christians begin to get that right
[1:52:45] catching a revelation
[1:52:47] of how this is
[1:52:49] satan begins to get ready
[1:52:52] to leave
[1:52:55] that's why the prophet of god told you
[1:52:56] pray for revelation because his
[1:52:57] revelation of this word starts to come
[1:52:59] into your life and it starts to as it
[1:53:01] were dominate you starts to change your
[1:53:03] thinkings change your outlook changes
[1:53:05] your understanding and it's there satan
[1:53:08] starts packing up
[1:53:10] now how fast he packs up
[1:53:12] is dependent upon
[1:53:14] how much and how quickly we submit
[1:53:19] i'm sad to say i view my own life as 21
[1:53:23] years
[1:53:24] plus
[1:53:25] wasted
[1:53:26] you say why paul you started serving the
[1:53:28] lord that 21 years later yes i did
[1:53:31] but i'm telling you
[1:53:33] i've held on to a lot of things
[1:53:36] i've held on to a lot of ideas a lot of
[1:53:38] spirits
[1:53:39] a lot of attitudes
[1:53:43] and some of them rare their head up
[1:53:47] and i have to say look i thought i
[1:53:49] buried you
[1:53:52] and then i have to decide do i go ahead
[1:53:54] i mean it's kind of a cute little pet
[1:53:56] after all attitude works in the day and
[1:53:58] age
[1:53:59] i'll have you to know
[1:54:02] i've believed this message
[1:54:04] for 40 years
[1:54:06] well how long you been saved
[1:54:09] that's all that matters
[1:54:11] the devil's believed for several
[1:54:12] thousand years and he's still not saved
[1:54:16] hmm come on
[1:54:17] that attitude won't do you a bit of good
[1:54:20] but better to say by the grace of god oh
[1:54:22] i've got quotes to back this up if you
[1:54:24] want them
[1:54:25] by the grace of god
[1:54:27] by the grace of god i've got nothing to
[1:54:30] boast of but the grace of almighty god
[1:54:34] has come and poured his grace out on me
[1:54:37] time after time year after year it's not
[1:54:41] me it's the grace of god
[1:54:44] and all i can say is thank you lord
[1:54:47] please lord make me a vessel lord that
[1:54:50] would be worthy for you to come
[1:54:53] because without that all we have
[1:54:56] is our attitude
[1:54:58] and our quotes
[1:55:03] let me get on
[1:55:05] sister and if you'll come please when
[1:55:07] christians begin to get that satan
[1:55:09] begins to get ready to leave
[1:55:11] he's finished when people can say
[1:55:13] i don't care
[1:55:15] now this is not an attitude of i don't
[1:55:17] care about nothing there's an attitude
[1:55:18] in this context
[1:55:20] no certain healer has to come by
[1:55:24] oh think about that my brother and
[1:55:26] sister i need healing and when brother
[1:55:28] so-and-so comes to our church again i'm
[1:55:30] going to come up for a healing why why
[1:55:32] are you waiting
[1:55:34] you come to the place i don't care any
[1:55:36] longer god is my god amen and he has
[1:55:40] called me and he has filled me with his
[1:55:42] holy spirit he's given me revelation i'm
[1:55:45] going to claim it any time any place
[1:55:47] that's necessary
[1:55:49] no certain healer has to come by no
[1:55:52] certain this has to happen only thing i
[1:55:54] want on earth is to hear that god said
[1:55:57] so
[1:55:58] that settles it with me then i'll take
[1:56:00] it and go from right there then you got
[1:56:03] it amen that's what we need pure
[1:56:05] unadulterated gospel teaching the church
[1:56:08] is dying for it that's right you believe
[1:56:10] that the world is that's right
[1:56:13] oh let's go on and continue this notice
[1:56:16] then abraham
[1:56:18] he was happy about that of course he
[1:56:20] went on and then we find out that there
[1:56:22] come a strife between lots herdsmen
[1:56:25] so forth and i want to show you just a
[1:56:27] little thing here in the coming of the
[1:56:29] lord just while we're in tonight
[1:56:31] i'm not trying to be late and i say amen
[1:56:33] to that it quickly to my point but watch
[1:56:35] here just abraham was an heir to the
[1:56:38] world
[1:56:39] and lot was a type of the lukewarm
[1:56:41] believer he
[1:56:43] was a believer
[1:56:46] let's get this right lukewarm or not he
[1:56:47] was a believer
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] he left his homeland
[1:56:53] to sojourn with god
[1:56:55] but always
[1:56:58] never
[1:57:00] fully
[1:57:01] surrendered
[1:57:05] who are we tonight
[1:57:07] are we a lot
[1:57:09] or are we in abraham
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:16] and that's the trouble with the full
[1:57:17] gospel church tonight
[1:57:19] along with the rest of them is people
[1:57:22] who left their world
[1:57:24] keep out of the world
[1:57:26] they don't want to go gambling and
[1:57:27] drinking carrying on
[1:57:30] they're a believer
[1:57:32] but have never made
[1:57:34] a complete
[1:57:36] surrender
[1:57:40] lord help us saints
[1:57:43] we can quote bible
[1:57:46] the message forwards and backwards
[1:57:49] we can tell you how many decades our
[1:57:52] family spent in the message
[1:57:54] and how many siblings and children and
[1:57:57] grandchildren are in the message
[1:58:00] and who we know
[1:58:02] in the message
[1:58:06] but without a complete surrender
[1:58:09] you will end up
[1:58:11] with an address
[1:58:13] in sodom
[1:58:14] [Music]

[2:10:39] things we've been speaking this morning
[2:10:41] it's where we get our inspiration right

[2:10:44] we get this from the word of god through
[2:10:46] a message

[2:10:49] but the prophet of god said these people
[2:10:51] let me just paraphrase it for you these
[2:10:52] people that always try to satisfy it
[2:10:55] some other way
