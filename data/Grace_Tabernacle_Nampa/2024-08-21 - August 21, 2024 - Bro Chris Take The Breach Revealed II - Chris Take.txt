give brother Ivan a chance to pull up my slides it's good to see be with all of you see I checked it on my own and maybe we to update our PowerPoint on the church computer so he'll have to adjust it a little bit um amen sister Alice I met your sister in at BCF and uh she I hope I'm okay and saying this she walked up and shake my hand and I was like why do I know this sister and she told me so that was that was awesome good to see you God bless you amen I last time I spoke um I uh like brother Paul said I usually Wednesdays we get um and I apologize some of this formatting is going to be off because I'm an Apple guy so I build my slides in keynote and I have to sh them to PowerPoint so let's all vote we uh put some kind of technology in here that I don't have to do that I can just cast right to it um so praise the Lord why don't we stand then tonight since he's ready and I would like to take U part two off of last service and um I went ahead and shortened our title to the breach revealed and I'd like to take the subject of the conflict at the word transition so if you have your Bibles one quick um scripture we have here in Revelations he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saying saving he that receive it receiveth it and if you remember the vision or the dream that Junior Jackson has um while this scripture is to the Philadelphia Church age I believe this it's the same applies to us that that Whit Stone has been revealed and been opened up for us amen Matthew chapter 24 so like brother Paul was saying I usually Wednesdays when I'm preaching at least right now works kind of slow so I have time to get off early and study throughout the day and 9:00 this morning my manager handed me a big old plate full so um just kind of didn't didn't show up for those of you saw show up late and I'm sorry for being a bad example but I was just typing away as fast as I could to wrap this up for tonight so amen Matthew 24 verse 22 and except those days should be shorten there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets Christ is Anointed false anointed ones and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so this is a familiar scripture but one thing to point out show great signs and wonders so they have they have the signs right they have these wonders and but they don't have the word in Deuteronomy it says a man comes to you with a dream or a vision and it comes to pass but he goes to take you from the word don't listen to him so it isn't enough that there's signs and wonders it must be the word so these signs and wonders being performed are within the midst of the church they're close to the bride because if if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so it has to be something close says behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be now we know brother Brandon talks about the son rising in the East right setting in the west I get that right and civilization moving from the East to the west and that the wet Coast West Coast is the end of that period so we we know by this and many othert scriptures we are in the coming of the son of man amen or he has come for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together Revelations 16 verse 13 so if you look there just one quick point we'll come back to it but says wheresoever the carcass is there will be Eagles will be gathered together and we know that there's um Eagles and vultures are interchanged and brother says it depends on the condition of the carcass if it's fresh then the Eagles are there if it's rotten then the vultures are there Revelation 16:13 and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty behold I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just ask you'd come tonight and speak to our hearts Lord Jesus we don't want this to be intellectual we want this to be stimulating by Revelation into our hearts Lord Jesus and father this is all about you and your word revealed to us in our day and father the more of you we see the more of you we we can take inside of us the more by Revelation Lord the more Life of Christ we can put forth Lord this is all about relationship Lord all about a connection with you seeing you Lord in a full picture Lord Jesus not with any pieces missing but in a full picture father Lord the the substance of the word Lord Jesus I pray you just speak to our hearts tonight Lord speak through by Faith Lord by Revelation and it cause us to see you greater in the scriptures we pray in Jesus name amen you can be seated tonight so we this this scripture here we're reading it's it's happens when the sixth Angel pours out his vial and brother says the this those vials the last vials poured out at the opening of the word the revealing of the seals and so this is not something to come this is what has happened and the three unclean spirits he says it's the Trinity of the frogs and we'll get to that so in here the scripture that I already I already touched on uming coming out of the East unto the West Coming of the son of man so okay we want to do a bit of a refresher on last time um the the in um Revelation chapter 4 give me some time to settle into this um he brother Ram says now the mer so we're going to go back what we talked about last time just a quick refresher we were talking about the the um the revealed in the under the Feast of atonement and how that that in order for the lamb to come forth and take the book he had to leave intercession Behind The Mercy Seat so brother Bram says here he says Now The Mercy Seat it's in the heart where The Shining forth of his glory and all of his children the sh glory in the human heart so that transition happened so the blood B talks about so the transition happened where Christ came forward took the book revealed the seals now he's no longer Behind The Mercy Seat making intercessions he's now in his bride and if you think about it I had somebody asked me this after I preached last time it says well what is the what is Christ's Ministry so I told them I said what is Christ's Ministry Christ's Ministry is to mediate he he brought his blood he gave his life he he spilled his blood that is redemption and so now the The Mercy Seat in the bride Christ is still here on on the earth the blood still covers that's why in Revelations when it says the bride goes up then the Beast comes and incarnates the Antichrist because we're here we're holding that back because Christ is making mediation in our hearts so while the while before the seals were open he was he was behind the throne and he was mediating and and brother the B says he was just like the Feast of atonements the priest would go and he would behind the we know he's Behind The Mercy Seat cuz he says he spread the blood Eastward so he would spread it Forward Eastward and that is the representing the covering of the seven Church ages because he would spread it forth seven times and then he came then he came forward then the priest come from there it says everyone's sins were covered but the priest then come around and he would he would sprinkle seven times in front of the mercy seat and that is the breaking of the seals and we also touched on how brother Brandon preaches it is the rising of the Sun and that's the first time he says turn the picture so brother is realizing it's Christ all of this is Christ it's the bride coming of Christ Christ was the first fruits the wave sheath waved in the first church ages and he says it'll have to happen again for the bride coming of Christ to pull her from the church ages into the bride age so that is what this was was Christ the wav showing forth by his word bring coming forth in the word that was the wave sheath so but the Brandon wasn't the wave sheath the message he brought was the wave sheath to say this is what you have to look like and now the seed is coming forth so at the opening of the book Christ turned a corner and the age of the P of Pentecost is over the word of that age will not suffice in this time right in invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day he said and then so the wheat is beginning to be seen so my wife we were talking after I preached and I had too many quotes and I said well I want to have proof and so I discovered footnotes and they are amazing so if you ever want to know where I'm getting this from I have footnotes so all of these quot I'm just referencing these quotes So it say the weed is beginning to be seen that it's not a Pentecostal age anymore cuz the shuck had to go away now the seed comes forth the Shu has passed on in the close of the seven Church ages and we talked last time how we have to understand we're underneath the umbrella of the leoan age because it says the mighty Angel come down book the book was open and he says time no longer and what that means is there's time delayed and if you look at the timeline of the earth brother B says it's 7,000 years 7,000 years for the creat as we know it not the earth and the universe those are billions and millions of years but the creation as we know it 7,000 years last 7,000 God rested then then then it was 2,000 to Noah 2000 to Christ I'm getting yes I think so anyways on down however you want to put it basically around the year 2000 and our years are off is the completion of that 6,000 years so then the next he says it's a Thousand-Year millennium so we are in a delay okay he says not that God's like oh no I didn't do my job right no it's just the way God's working so he says we're baking in the sun right the seed is baking in leadership he says now you see it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is the bride age okay so that kind of a refresher what we talked about last time and I wanted to come as my as my subject is is listed as the conflict at the word transition so I kind of wanted to to to focus in on this conflict that happens when the word turns a corner as you could as as we say it um there's always a conflict when word goes on there's always a conflict and when God turns a corner and God always turns a corner at the close of an age when when when he when the word we lost the NAA Council we shift it the word changed right didn't change I I should say the word progressed went into the ground so there was a shift the seed The Original Seed went into the ground there was a shift and on down through the church ages and every time there was a shift there was an age and brother M says the messenger comes at the end of the age so because he's bringing the word forth so every time that happens there's a conflict at that transition and you understand in your own personal lives when there's a transition there is conflict sometimes within yourself sometimes with your family sometimes with your spouse sometimes with your children however it might be there's when there's transitions in our lives there is conflict uh when a child is going from uh being a kid to being an adolescent there's a conflict of emotions in their life so there's always Conflict at these transitions so but our Victory is found when when we when we find our position and lay hold of Faith or or revelation of the word brother B talks about in the church age book if she if the when the bride realizes who she is in other words her position and it's not and it's not that we convince you you're powerful right it's that you see yourself in the word in other words you get a revelation of what we're talking about revelation of what the pastor is preaching revelation of the word when you read the seals you see Christ and it's expanding and it's expounding to you you now there's always more to learn because we are going to learn about Christ for eternity so always a progression of your Revelation you go back to what I preached when I first started it' be different than now and in another five years another year sometimes another couple months God gives you greater Revelation his word doesn't change you change you grow into his word that's right so but Revelation is very very very important brother bam says it's more important than we realize and so the word of the previous age is vulture food now I have a quote at the close of the sermon it says brother M says we're preaching the same gospel Luther preached Wesley preached Pentecost he's just there's just some added to it so you it's the it's the progression of the opening of the word you have to remember through the church ages they didn't have what we have today that is why in Hebrews it says they without us are not made perfect the word had to be restored in flesh again okay the seed had to go into ground if God didn't if God didn't you know ascended on high if he didn't plant himself in the ground and go down in the Dark Ages he wouldn't be able to reproduce himself in a bride so anytime you try to you try to go back and say well we need this back there instead of what God has today you're feeding on Rotten Mana okay Mana was given at the beginning of every day and if you held it over to the next day or the next Church ages it became full of worms and you'll remember brother it says the word God says I will restore everything the worm or the Locust and the cankerworm has eaten up so there's this there's this transition where the word was held over and it it it it rotted and in that transition there's two things that happen you either denominate or you go on with Christ right okay so he says in no1 at the end time Moses was an eagle and he never gave the children of God Noah's leftovers see he had the fresh word of God the word is Mana now the type to our age was the hidden Mana so this was the church ages Mana would go bad the next age God would be would bring the word forth there would be denomination and there would be the truth in our age we're typing the word the Mana in inside the holiest of holies because it was there with the ark with the mercy seat so that word is now in us right and it's not going to denominate right you see we're not eating the Mana outside the Tabernacle we are eating the Mana ins inside the Tabernacle that's a tent Vision yeah that's it okay you go and you receiving Christ okay because we're not eating the Mana outside we're eating the Mana inside and the Mana inside the holies of holies welcome back Joel and Leah missed you guys inside the holiest of holies was Mana inside the ark that never perished that is the revealed word so for for seven Church ages the man of fell was was eaten went bad denomination and the Mana fell again but in the last stage after the close of Pentecost God came forth and took the book and he revealed it to us now we have access to that hidden manner he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me you see this is this is um this is I see now where I got off this is a revelation the revelation of the present day word is necessary to reach the goal revelation of present word is necessary to reach the goal because he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God you know pleasing pleasing the Lord is a requirement for a secured relationship without Revelation it is impossible to please God that's this is like Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him see it's not Faith to heal your foot Faith to to to to heal your dog or or faith for for money in the bank this is a revelation of who Christ is W without that how can you please him how can you please a husband you don't even know how can you have a relationship with somebody you don't know and you he's not there in Pentecost anymore he is here he is here in the midst with us he's not in Wesley anymore he's not in the methodists he's here with us in the in his revealed word where his word is the present truth you see he he is the word the present truth so it's imperative for Rel for relationship with him to know present truth he says he didn't say I am uh he didn't say I I I was tell the children of Israel I was they kept saying the god Abraham Isaac and Jacob and God said no no no no no no no Moses is here I am tell them I am that I am in other words present God he brings it from the past and he says that isn't enough anymore you need this now I am and through through the ministry of Moses we know all the types but the B says in and and the okay therefore if we can find the transition in the word we can find where we missed the turn and get back on track okay that's why it's important to know where we are he says I I said third sh I said shoot a gun if you don't hit the target find where it went off at you got to come back there and start again so go back to where it was so if you find yourself without God you go back to where he was or it's not even that in the transition God has to show his bride through Revelation where she is where the word is but preached God's provided place of worship and he talked about all of these things because he had the word had to show you where you are so you know where to go with the word so in the W uh in the Luther Wesley transition there was conflict you know uh J um Judas Luther he he said justification for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now this was this was the r says there was no prophets through the church ages they were ref reformers then there had to come a prophet to reveal the word so they're reforming they're seeing this stuff in the scripture Luther says I don't have to pay this Catholic Church all this money for indul indulgences and he he turned the world upside down and he and he changed it but then but then now not Luther cuz Luther passed but then the people with that message then that there came the next the they came the man of fourth at the next age of Wesley and there was a conflict but says and God's only provide a place of worship he says try to go back say well now we're Lutheran we want to come up here you've got to die to the Lutheran age to be born in the Wesley age yes that's a frog cuz frogs always look back they're looking back that's why those those three spirits that we read about that were released in the vials they were they were unclean spirits like frogs cuz they're here by says they're always looking back he says looking back to NAA looking back to the vulture food so they're saying Wesley's message comes and they're all the lutherans are saying no we got to go back it's justification they got to go back to this back to this back to this and they miss the word transition then we have sanctification with the and this brings forth the Wesley Pentecost transition and um in in in when when you in in these transitions it's those those who the the spirit of denomination tries to hold on to the word of the previous age that is the spirit denomination because brother brandom says it's organization it's man organized he say they miss God in other words they're hold they they had truth but they held on to it overnight and it soured because God had fresh word for them they're trying to feed on Luther's leftovers when Wesley has a fresh meal you ever had leftovers and Mom's like look kids you know or the wife's like look honey this is about to go bad we got to eat it it's like we should have just thrown it away right so it kind of tastes like the refrigerator so that's what happens so there's a conflict to even well maybe not so much today because you know of The ecumenical council of churches and and all of that but there was all this conflict you know methodists couldn't you know walk on the same side of the street as Presbyterians and so on and so forth right this conflict between these ideas because they said this is it and they were right this is it this changed my life and they're right this or this changed my grandpa's life this changed my Dad's life and they're right but they stopped right the problem is is when you stop and you hold on to this you hold on to this over here there's always more Revelation there's always more of God and with Revelation see part of the conflict is that with Revelation comes correction yes that's right Wesley said you're Justified you are dirty they were offended by him I think at the beginning of his ministry he got kicked out of a bunch of churches that was him my kids were watching uh I forget what it's called lamplighters or something like that and they the the the preacher I think it was Wesley kept getting dragged out of the church so they were offended he was just fire so he preached in the fields and they came if I have the wrong guy you forgive me but the point still stands you hear these Lutheran who bless God they're not Catholic but they're immoral they're drunk I hope you're catching what we're saying here they're holding on to it they got it right but they didn't anymore cuz God transist but there was a conflict then Wesley man Sanctified they had they were coming coming to you know it's God's kind of working it forth he says but talks about growing the plant growing looking closer and closer to the truth Methodist man they were they would shout they would they had the anointing of the holy spirit so they were kind of like Pentecostals but but they they I mean sanctify falling on the altar crying out for God to to help them to to forgive them to clean them and then you have the the and then they they get you know Wesley passes on that they have an established church and hey you know this is this is it and then the Holy Rollers came and you had brother brand says the restoration of the gifts you have to die in Wesley age to be born in Pentecostal age so Pentecost the Holy Spirit baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts you know we we have we have Acts 2:4 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance restoration of the gifts so brother bam says if I forget exactly how he says it but he says there'll be another book of Acts that's right and if we're not careful we'll be like frogs and we'll look at the interpretation of that through the lens of Pentecost pente Pentecost is called Pentecost because it was the Feast of Weeks this is not Pentecost this is this is an outpouring that happened to them so not everybody speaks with tongues if if this is what we have to go back if this is it then there's a lot of us who don't have it right yeah it's true but brother brandham saw you see as the transition because brother Brenham is the messenger okay he comes what is one of the biggest things he sees at the beginning the two men who spoke in tongues and interpretations so it was in order it was correct one was one was had two families so that is not the book of Acts brother baram's talking about the book of Acts he's saying a restoration of the word in its original form the original form is not speaking in tongues right they caught a revelation of their day the moving of the holy spirit so Pentecost you know they they the the zash sheet Revival and and and we see it in denominations and I and I almost pulled up a video but I I forgot about it so maybe the Lord doesn't want me to show it but it was it says Pentecostal preacher back in the '90s and you watch it you realize this is going to come come out very straight I don't mean this any other way except for to show you where we are it doesn't look like it looks like just like an a Revival we would have Revival we would have so there's a lot that we hold on to there's a lot that we take a hold of that is a tradition of Pentecostalism yes and we say and if we're not careful we'll look back through the eyes of a frog and we'll say we need to go back the Bible never says go back it says well brother Chris Malachi 4 says back to the faith to the hearts of the children back to the fathers that's a restoration of the word but B says the faith of the fathers it's the restoration of the word in its original form amen not back to the last to 1906 because you see what happened it denominated if that was the thing we need it wouldn't have denominated but it denominated but we needed it it was the but there's a quote here later on it was the carrier so he says and you have to die in the Pentecostal age leave nothing of it left burn it with fire you know he he says we have the we read you just read the quote this is all in the same paragraph he says you know you got to die in Luther's age got to die by say when he gets to this point I find it interesting he he says leave nothing of it left burn it with fire he says because that's what's going to happen to the to the shocks and all of that right the the seed comes forth from that so we're not we're not Downing on the gifts we're Downing on the message of go back to Pentecost because that is not where the word is the only place I know the places I see in the Bible where people are trying to the people of God are trying to go back was to the leaks and the garlics of Egypt that's right and this is the anointing poured out under the Sixth Seal by this vial so no wonder we're dealing with it the the the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up so all of this is is past tense this has been poured out that I might have the timing a little off but it's under this that that that we we live today actually no I'm sorry it is under the six because but BR says it's trinitarianism saying go back to NAA okay so this was poured out in our day no wonder we have that anointing trickling into the message trying to go back and we're not here to get on our high horses about that you can be convinced and then concerned yeah but don't be become critical and it's just the signs of the times that we live in okay there's a the the so the the reason that he says the message won't denominate because the message is Christ okay then why where is the denominational spirit in the message coming from it's coming from this right here trying to go back to Pentecostalism trying to go back to p Pentecost but says the faith of the fathers the faith of the Pentecostal fathers he never says go back and start running around on the streets and and somehow speaking everybody's tongue that was that was them that was what happened to them and not to say that can't happen but that wasn't the point what brought that forth in them was it just because the Holy Ghost fell on them in the offer room it was because they caught a revelation the Holy Ghost came and baptized him they got the new birth and then they saw Christ they spent three whatever three and a half three years with this man he died he rises again wow then then he's gone and then there they are and the Holy Ghost Falls they get the new birth and with that comes a revelation yes and they go oh excuse me they go wow and Peter comes forth where in the world did he get acts 238 from the white stone between the lines he understood the point he caught a revelation of the message that was given to him that is what we have to go back to that is the foundation that I'm sorry that's what brings forth in my personal opinion true emotion yes amen when you see yourself in the word nothing can that that I mean that's just that gets me very excited as you can see Revelations chap 10 brother Bram was sitting in the woods talking about running around the tree it was because he CAU revelation of something yes that's right Revelations 10 we're just going to read the whole chapter very familiar portion of scripture and they saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head now you remember we had the cloud in Life Magazine on the other side of the page was the rainbow it wasn't happen stance it was further Testament that this Mighty Angel is Christ himself and not just that alone but that was that was in addition to everything else that happened and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open if someone wants to tell you the seals are closed which I think that's dying out with their generation but um now we have people saying the seals are open the seals are open they have no idea what they're talking about so there's transitions in time yeah but a little book open I'm not going to I'm just going to move on and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared so thunder come forth right he says when he cried seven Thunders utter their voices brother B was trying to go preach the seven Thunders and then God spoke to him and said those are revealed under the seals because it's the voice of God the Thunders come forth the voice of God God spoke through the revealing of the seals and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write so it's the Revelation it's not just the voice of God it's hearing but John heard the Thunders he had a revelation of the Thunders and he went to write the revelation of the Seven Seals God said don't the angel said don't write it so that's what the Thunders are and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea seal okay seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so that was revealed and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are okay let's skip to verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished when th shall begin to sound 47 no when he begins to sound forth the message God had to bring him to revelation God had to bring him to a point a point where God brought the word forth so you see a a progression over those years don't dis discredit it it's the truth still you see the Revelation growing Jesus was on Earth for 30 years that's right okay but then he gets that then he begins to sound when the word begins to be revealed and at that point the mystery of God should be started should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets now and now verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth so the book is open now where does the book go does the book the book where do where does the book go into the hand of the Bride John is the type of the Bride into the hand of the Bride the Mighty the angel unto the angel so this is the mighty Angel says go take the book so the word came forth and the word said the same thing throughout the open opening of the book the opening of the seals through the end of this ministry the word said the same thing take the book when the bride took the book God turned the corner right okay so it was there it was ready but John had to go take it when the bride took it God turned the corner there is men who are still alive today who early in the early years of the message when people were floundering and brother B Pastor all these weird doctrines come forth from that there was men who started to catch a revelation and begin to preach the opening of the word through the five-fold ministry God Reveals His word he came and opened the book now through the preaching of the fful ministry he imparts that to the bride cuz it's his spoken word spoken word is the Original Seed so God turned the corner now if if if the bride took the book who has the book it's now the bride's Ministry when Elijah went up there was there was I think three things he was supposed to do he supposed to anoint Elisha or two things or whatever he was supposed to anoint the king of Syria and he didn't Elisha did and it was a type of God completing the ministry through the bride Elisha is the type of the Bride so God comes now he says go and take the book and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings in other words you've eaten the book now speak the book confess the book Minister the book through your life you see you're going to testify your your life testifies your your words testify or it should if it's not you see there's a transition there's a transition in our lives where where we go from being immature Christians on the brother Paul talking about this on the sincere milk of the word and then we transition to the meat or the substance of the word if this did if this if this doesn't matter because there there's some that say it doesn't if this doesn't matter and we just need to preach Deliverance why was it revealed right I heard I heard a minister a message Minister say we just need more Deliverance messages preached and I asked him but he didn't hear me so I haven't yet found God his answer answer what is that right last I checked make sure I say this in Love Last I check the word is what delivers so therefore you want Deliverance in your life you want to grow spiritually what do you need do you need more anointing right do you need do you need more anointing both physically and L uh literally and uh figuratively I'm on the edge if when you catch revelation of the word your life changes absolutely and when it changes in that fashion you don't have post Camp Blues you don't have oh man it's back when you see yourself and Lord willing I'll just say this Lord willing I have a sermon on the balance of the fful ministry because I heard a brother preaching and he said he said the teacher the teacher looks at the Evangelist and goes you didn't finish your thought and the Apostle says why are you all sitting around no one's left their Church in three days and the the the pastor you know he I he didn't give an example of the pastor but and he said the Evangelist says you know he says if we could work together praise the Lord so he says take the book so John takes the book and in the rising of the sun brother says it is in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days yes in order to bring the bride forth a sheath had to be waved so God turned a corner God was God was the revelation of the word was coming forth and I went unto the angel and said give me the book and took the little book you see the Gentile church is brother talks about this is blinded from the veil again just like the Jews with it in in with Jesus because he's veiled in flesh again in the unveiling of the unveiling of God paragraph 221 he talks about that you see God's program can't be broken the blinding has to come again and the blinding came here here's what I found very fascinating but brother BR says in this quote the blinding came by they said to Jesus you a man making yourself God right but says that's where the blinding came so they look at us and we say we're the word in flesh or we preach it's Christ in you it's the word made flesh and it's that Revelation right there that people stumble on even people who H who who are in the message and believe the prophet and and go to good churches they can't receive that because I don't know why their time hadn't come yet so God is veiled in a human being again the mercy seed is in the heart of the Bride you see see like you you can't you can't leave God there in history Perfect song you you got to bring him forward so to where you live today I'm trying better to stay on track okay the seed is not erir at the shook brother bam says this he says and the shook let me make sure I close this thought okay and the so the shu is a carrier so now let's let's move even even further because we're in the Pentecost bride age transition okay this is happening in the message this is happening in the message that spirit is trying to anoint you to say go back because if you look back to vulture food you have no victory in your life the shuck is a carrier is just exactly what our denominations has been a carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and now it's time for the seed to come forth so Christ's Ministry continues continues in the bride the seed comes forth the original seed comes forth which is his excuse me his body why was it that that that why in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of creation did God take a rib out of Adam and create Eve because he did the same thing with the bride he we are a part of him he expressed us so we are his body same word different mask Christ in morphe amen he says now you see it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is the bride age and like I to to to to bring to your remembrance the seeds of denomination denominationalism is all about going back to the previous message that is what denominationalism and that was clearly laid out in this scripture Revelation 16:13 three unclean spirits like frogs and that that is the spirit so so this is this is the amazing thing and and why you convinced concerned then you can't be critical because the spirit of this we've seen it we've interacted with with it in the message itself and we're troubled by it and this is why you have to lay in the word and say God this is not about a head knowledge this is not about me convincing somebody I'm right based on quotes based on scriptures this is about a relationship with Christ and the reason you have to be there because when you really see this you realize the spirit of this is trinitarianism right and it's in the message yes in the church he says it's a trinity of frogs they frogs and animal that always looks backward he never looks where he's going he looks where he's come from no wonder under that anointing there's no Victory right because they don't look where they're going if I walk down if I drive if I walk and I don't look where I'm going I'm going to run into stuff like my goodness you know I just wish you know L you know just Saints pray for me you know I lost the bumper on my car and I can't afford a new one well how well I close my eyes while I was driving now that's a funny example but that's what people are doing spiritually they're coming to church saying pastor pray for me pray for me what they what what what we need is to say let me talk to you what's the problem well I have no victory in my life do you have a TV in your house yeah yes you'd be surprised how that is the thing in the message not a screen TV all that filth and that trash you can't filter just comes through okay or do you have a phone yes do you have full access yes that's your problem your problem is not oh you need Deliverance you need Deliverance no you need respon responsibility but you see why are they floundering in that position we all go through that okay so I'm not saying because you're going through that you have the spirit of a frog what I'm saying is it is if we don't take them to the word and we say yes let's all gather together and and and cast it and I don't want this come out harsh I'm just making a point cast that Spirit out they'll go home and they'll do the same thing and they'll think something's right wrong with them you're trying to administer the Pentecostal the a the message of Pentecost you're trying to bring it forward or bring us back to that for deliverance that was their message that was back then but then what happened brother brandham came and he said unless you become the word in flesh and they said we can't walk with that Pentecostalism Pentecost denominated because they couldn't receive the cross ing into the word okay so I hope that point made sense it's it's it's not it's not about you see when a when a a child of God okay that's right I don't want to leave I don't want to leave this so there's a child they have to grow up but they have to realize that that as the word comes you grow and and you you stop floundering as a child and you realize that I have to feed on the word yes they're asking for deliverance they want a quick fix they want to come to the camp where where where there's or they want to come to the meeting or they want to come to church and they want the preacher to pray for them and they want to be delivered but they don't want to change anything in their life they don't want to listen to the tapes anymore they don't want to listen to read their Bible more you cannot survive as a child of God unless you listen to the word every day amen you will notice the effects in your life you have to pray you have to that's why it's here you have to partake of it and a lot of a lot of of of uh mistakes come when when the realization that you need more word isn't isn't doesn't come across so you have to come to a point as a child of God where you realize I need more word and then and then sometimes you have to say God give me a Hunger for More word right help me to put down the book help me to to put down the phone and and give me a desire for your word sometimes you have to start there and many times you have to you have to decrease the distractions around you this is what this is what changes situations we we need to grow the word the word has shifted the word has transition we need to grow to the point where we realize and a true evangelist will do will will Point things in your life and you will go ouch evangelism is not Pentecostal preachers right we we we we got that idea in her in our heads because of traditions of the past that rolled forward and now we have young people raising up who think that's an anointed preacher that is an emotional preacher but true evangelism what what is the point of evangelizing it's It's to to point out the error without any kind of attack just straight to the point you look like a devil get God that's evangelism and he and but you're bringing it with the word and then the pastor picks up the pieces that's evangelism this hurah a God help me I don't want to get but if if the if the message if the message let me put this way because this isn't about people principalities powers of the air if the message that's coming across that's you're feeding on is you're the bride you're the bride you're the bride you have the victory you have the victory you have the Victory and you don't yeah I'm sorry you're not the bride yet but you say well predestination of course so you'll come to that place but you're not acting like the bride right if I can't get I should not preach and tell you who you are I should say this is Christ and you see that and you say oh that's me the the mom didn't take the little baby boy over to the mirror and say look that's you yeah he sat and looked at himself in the mirror yeah that's right and he goes I don't understand what I'm looking at what is this and he goes hm Mom that's me you see a revelation on his own through the guidance of the word preached right the the the even evangelism there's substance to it there is substance to it we are not called to to work ourselves up to to to be inspired to say okay I'm going to go home and put my foot on the devil what does that even mean yeah you know what that means that means going home is pushing play I just brought two ideas together and clashed in the middle okay we're going to move on because like I said you have to be careful that you're not critical so he says he says now here so this is all about your position you see Victory is found in your position he says it says um so this is an an adoption and I just pulled the clip out of here but he's talking about preaching PL uh preaching takes the sinner catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word he says but the teaching places the man positionally he says and we can never rightly see so you have to have the balance of the five-fold ministry maybe that'll be part three and we can never rightly be able to have faith say what until positionally we know what we are do you all know are we all trying to to move to the Statue of a perfect man I believe that is the desire of everybody in the message that is the desires of their hearts unless they are just completely out there what is the first step in the pyramid faith we can never rightly be able to start at the bottom of the pyramid until we positionally know what we are right how do we know what we are if we're the word made flesh we need to know then what the word is and if we need to know what the word is we understand through the scriptures that we need to know I am present truth so therefore you need to know what was revealed under those Seven Seals otherwise it was pointless so you need to be saying God I don't understand and you need to be pushing for that even even you see there's something that happens in your life me and a brother were talking about this something that happens in your life and you can hear somebody preach you can have a conversation with somebody and you can say that person is looking at the white stone the white stone is is the dream of Junior Jackson brother bham grabs a crowbar and the Mysteries were written on the outside we can read them we can read about serp in the Bible we can read about godhead but then he says he grabbed a crowbar out of somewhere popped the top off said look on this and he went East West he went West to go get the revelation of what was between the lines so it's not even written there was a space of Silence in heaven for half an hour about a half an hour it's not even written he say oh brother Chris you just lost it because you're adding and taking from the word no it's the Revelation between the lines and when somebody has re revelation of that even as an evangelist you can hear them when they preach they're looking at the white stone you see we are called to move up higher if God is just a little faster we need to get closer to our theophany because our theophany moves a little faster so the closer we get what is the theophany but says it's your word body do you know why Enoch translated too much word I I said that in Flaga and a good friend of mine brother Emanuel Salazar who's a pastor in New Mexico he goes you had me for a second I thought where is he going with this there was so much word so much Revelation that Enoch connected with his word body that's why you have to be the word made flesh so if you would be the word made flesh do you need more Deliverance services or do you need the word preached the word preached is a Deliverance service that's right a man under the true anointing with his eyes open can teach you can teach you not I'm not lifting myself up but for example with slides and and and it can go on for an hour and a half but when it's the teaching of the word through Revelation and inspiration it can set you on fire like you never been on fire before but like I said You' got to have the fivefold ministry you have to be balanced because even an a mature Christian needs the Evangelist to get up sometimes and preach on the pride of life and preach on selfishness yes because guess what faith Temperance I don't know if it's that right order I taught this to the youth for like six or eight months and I still can't remember the order Faith Temperance knowledge brotherly kindness all of these things are there those are not exciting things but a true evangelist will come and say you are not Temperance but you see if you have the foundation of Faith you positionally know where you are you are in position to receive that word amen that is why it's so important that you find your position because then you are in a place where you can receive receive the word and if you're in the wrong age you're not in the right position I I put in here um I referenced the children of Israel saying we want to go back to Egypt that's numbers 115 to7 I'm closing here so this bam in questions and answers he says this and I paraphrase he says this the same message down through Luther Wesley Pentecost only something more added to it with the revealing of the seals that's what he says a so it's a further revelation of the same gospel that's why you have to be careful but when you say you can't say because you speak in tongues you are not of God it's a furthering of the Gospel same gospel but there's a time in a place right there's all that so he says future home of the heavly badroom and the Earthly bride the bride is the only one who can recognize her place in the Kingdom recognizing your position in Christ comes through a revelation of what was revealed red under the Seven Seals because what was revealed was the entire Plan of Redemption it was says the book now with it revealed you can look between the lines and catch Christ in you the hope of glory so we have come to a place sister VI you want to come we have come to a place the Saints of the ages longed for the word in flesh again within the Bride of Jesus Christ recognizing this in the word brings relationship with the bridegroom recognizing that God is in flesh again brings relationship with the bridegroom because then you are in the position of the word and being in that position you got to be in the same house you got to be in the same bedroom to have a relationship ship with your husband right so you have to be in the same position as him and then in the in the as I in closing this is what we have we have all four anointings to combat the pel horse rider to combat the to the to combat the the the the Antichrist Spirit you need the whole picture and we know that if you think about it the whole picture is The Mercy Seat is in the Bride of Jesus Christ so then where are the four beasts around the throne right they're in the bride of Christ to protect Matthew Mark Luke and John to protect to protect what to protect you amen he you know he said he said okay you know the lion age you sent out the lion the ox okay you go the man you send the man the eagle came Prophet The Prophet's message came revealed it but then God said now I'm going to come myself so he took his whole team down into the bride the mercy on the bride and now this is what you have you have word in flesh again the word is in the hand of the bride and Christ himself is the headship the fire that's that's in there burning is Christ inside of his bride yes where is the word where is God right here you Amen in you the Bride of Jesus Christ so therefore this is something you need to memorize no this is something you need to C to revelation of cuz when you have revelation of it your life testifies you've been with the bridegroom amen amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you so much for your word tonight Lord thank you for speaking to us Lord Jesus father we can feel your presence near you you like when you're talked about and and you come near Lord Jesus so father you're near with us Lord just pray you take the word now and it would go from our heads and by the spirit of God down into our hearts Lord that you would change us what good is it to have an intellectual understanding of these things if we don't have the Life of Christ we missed it then we are no different than the Pharisees who understood the scriptures but had no Revelation in their hearts and missed you we don't want to miss you Lord we don't want to be a parrot of the message a parrot of quotes a parot of scriptures we want to be a we want to be the bride Mrs Jesus Christ we want our lives to reflect that we spend a lot of time with you Lord we want our conversations to reflect we spend a lot of time with you we want our standard to reflect we spent a lot of time with you we want our we want our our our our conduct and and and how we do business to reflect that we spent a lot of time with you Lord I know I I fall short of that Lord Jesus Lord I see your word I see you how you how you so perfectly came down and revealed yourself to us set before us a banquet set before us a a just a a full meal meal and we say no thanks I want crackers and water we want to take part of the world we want to take part of entertainment to fill to fill what it just creates more of a void within us God give us a Zeal for your word give us a hunger for your word Lord Jesus I if if what was said tonight was a bit confusing in different places father may you give us if it was my fault God you just smooth that over but if it was a lack of Revelation Lord may you come and now begin to apply that and they begin to people we would begin to meditate on it and and and see it as we we open our book in the morning and and and we read the devotions and we read about you and we put on a tape may you speak back what was spoken tonight to our hearts and vindicate it to us Lord Jesus that we know that we know you are the one we see you in flesh again within our hearts Lord Jesus that we can look in the mirror of the word and say Daddy it's me thank you Jesus thank you Lord we love you Lord Jesus in Precious name we pray [Music] amen for more of you more of you more of you oh more of you I've had it all but what I need is more of you all things I've had my feel [Music] for more of you sing that again more of you yes Lord Jesus more of you I've had it all but what I need is more of you of things I've had my feel but yet I hunger still empty and be Lord hear my prayer for more of [Music] you amen I think we'll close with this song The Communion song I know I sang it last time but for me it just in my season of life right now it really speaks to my heart the Communion song I think it's 1088 Maybe [Music] on the road to emus three men walked that day reach their destination to B the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread and pouring wine I finally now realized the Simplicity of this side oh how could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be some something more within that only he can see I
