me constantly living me Victory the reality something keeps holding me amen isn't that wonderful the reality amen how beautiful that is amen well I know brother Isaac welcomed brother Luke sister Jennifer and uh Ethan and Loretta but uh it's real privilege they've been at the house with us and uh uh just a lovely time as a on a little road trip here just Lord bless them traveling mercies and we've considered a privilege to have you in our home amen amen sister Carrie sister Ruth going down to visit and I word this correctly sister aona and brother pant and so we just pray God give you traveling mercies uh that they would go I don't know did the weather cooperate or is it seems like it is yeah we've been praying the Lord would just so praise the Lord just in case amen well we'll be praying for their travels let's stand and just go into the word this evening I believe this last song that uh brother Isaac felt led to sing is is beautiful uh my brother and sister because we look into it and see the reality of what God is doing and and we're going to have just um I don't know I have a topic I have a theme uh it might wander around uh you know there might be some rustling in the mberry bushes um and that's yes yes we but but God is good I want to speak to you tonight the title of when the vision unfolds and um you know God is great uh you know our scripture uh Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and uh so as we read that we we want to just look into the vision tonight for just a few minutes and uh realize just how important this scripture is for us God bless you brother Daniel Amen uh and uh how important it is because uh uh there is h a a vision that we must possess and if we don't possess that Vision then we will just have a form of godliness a religion but when we have that when that vision is very clear to us it becomes so personal that there's nothing on this Earth that can detour us from that and uh you know Satan I I I see this you know as we're coming to church it seems like that we're joining the ranks of other parts of the world there's two seasons summer construction and winter construction and uh I just you know struck me that uh we come and and we we are going along on the road of life and there's a detour sign and you know Satan would like it to just detour us right away from serving God but you know God says no problem I'll take you I'll be with you on the detour and we'll come around and and we'll go and I'll get you to where I called you to and uh so I've already read this scripture you may be seated amen hallelujah now as we look at this tonight we just want to realize that there is a vision for the age and um as it is it's coming there as we look in Revelations 3 it's very clear to us shows us very clearly what the spirits the nature and the vision is of the age and and as we look at that we come down to the the vision of the age and we'll recognize that there are certain attributes that must be fulfilled in this day now brother brandham said that God is actually waiting on us to manifest those so we look at that and realize that the outpouring of the holy spirit in this day is something that God is Not arm wrestling us into it but he's placing an Ever growing desire in our heart that we would long to see the word of God manifested and the Rapture my brother and sister is is not an escape for us it is not you know oh if we can just survive till the Rapture but the Rapture is actually the Fulfillment of a relationship and that relationship bringing us into a place that our body as it were our spirit yearns to be in the presence of God more than it desires to be in this earth or in our flesh and so we look at that and as a prophet's message has come down been revealed all through this scripture now do we realize the message to Le oysa started in Genesis 1 amen it's not something that was just uh late in the in in the God's manifesting of it but it's starts right back in the very beginning of the word and the word just is built and built and built and built until we come to a place that we as Sons and Daughters of God are are in a place that the word has has made a such a change in us and so as we'll look at this uh I I don't think I'm I'm going to you know try to explain every degree of this because we are are message Believers and we understand what God sent but we must come and realize that the vision for the age my brother and sister I is is uh to have one thing and we need that Vision if we don't have that Vision we're going to struggle to see what God is doing and uh we come down and and a church needs to have a vision if we have no vision as a church we we just stumble along and and uh have church Sundays and Wednesdays Sunday and Wednesday with no real uh Vision to move forward or what God would desire of us but tonight I want to actually touch uh more on what I would say is a personal vision and as we sit here tonight each one of us has a personal vision and it would be in the natural but we're focused on the spiritual and you know in the personal spiritual vision we we have to find ourself in the word of God we we can't sit back and just say I believe God sent a prophet I believe there's a message here but we have to find ourselves and and brother brandham you know taught us his his very simple words I remember as a little boy they struck me very profoundly now because of what my namesake is you know brother Brown says you need to find yourself in the Bible and I remember back there in my juvenile time let like well that's not too hard but you see it's not to find a name but it is to find ourself in this position of who we are expressed in the scripture not just to say well I'm in this book or that book but to find ourselves expressed in the scripture and then that becomes our personal Vision when we realize that uh God called before the foundation of the world those words are good and the fact that the Lord you know scripture says that he never lost a one that is wonderful but when you need to personalize yourself into those things so that when you stand there and realize the price that Christ paid for you and I the effort that he has made and how he is so lovingly patient now I don't know about you but I'm sure I burnt up seemingly my fair share of God's patience and yet it's inexhaustible it in it it's still here it's still being expressed I see it in the very simple things of my life God's patience for me and uh so in our personal Vision we must see how we fit in this economy we can say well predestination I believe I'm a Son of God I believe that he called me before the foundation of the world he's made this way before me but if you stop there you'll find yourself in a kind of a little bit of if I could use the phrase a little bit of a limbo because you see God didn't just call us here to to say I believe the message he called us here to do his work we are his hands his feet his H his lips his ears everything this is who we are so there's purpose for us not just to sit on a church pew pretty easy to sit on a church pew but it's pretty easy as uh we see it to backslide on the church pew and so what God's expecting for us is to really see where we fit and uh uh uh and how we fit and there's a lot fits that you can have in there because each one of us must be placed in a certain particular place you say well I feel like my calling is to sit here on the Pew I'm not called to an office maybe I'm a sister this is just what I'm called to but you see there's much more than that because even as we sit here tonight we are here and there's not a lot of loud Hallelujah and amens right you guys heard me say that right amen but you see that really doesn't matter that's not what God's looking for God's looking for the heart that is saying amen so if it never really touches our lips I've been in Services where they're like well you must not believe it very much you're not amening it but really that's not true because we can be sitting at certain stages in our life under certain circumstances and and in our heart we're rejoicing or maybe being chastised or whatever it might be but in our heart because we are Sons and Daughters of God we're actually rejoicing that the word is coming and touching our life whether it's just completely a blessing or whether there's correction involved and our heart is rejoicing because we are Sons and Daughters of God and so the word comes and it brings us to a place and when we see how we fit into the economy of God then we will tend to see in a greater revelation of where we fit and so as it comes my brother and sister not everyone is going to be the preacher and uh and that that well I'll just keep that thought to myself um but anyway uh you know it it's not I'll just say it it's not as glorious as people think it is and so as it is you look at this and you say well you know what if I'm just the one who comes and turns on the lights you see you're part of God's economy performing God's word cuz someone needs to turn on the lights and so you know we look at the great spiritual view of it we realize that there has to be this body complete right and uh you're here again uh we were visiting about brother Steve Bron I just reminded many years ago he was preaching at a church and he just made a statement I'm not going to quote quotes because if you're in the message like you should be you'll know I'm preaching it so you look at this and realize that that the foundation has been laid it's not just simply we believe God sent a prophet and uh praise God we're going to go into Rapture my brother and sister we must be positionally placed and as it is all through Israel all through the ages of Old Testament we see constantly a placing and they're being put into these positions we come in the New Testament the world stumbled over that because they're thinking that that means the Covenant of Grace allows us to place ourselves but that's not what God did he still is positionally placing Sons and Daughters of God now in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ uh brother Brown says th this the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day now sometimes if you don't use a quote right here and not able to put it in context people will think that you're kind of saying wait that that won't work for our day you know what are you saying but you see the prophet's making a point here the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day so let's not sit here and long to go back to the day of Pentecost because of Prophet is here telling us that's not going to work no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the going home of the Bride we got something different now this has been posed to me as a question you before do you think we have more than they did you got to be careful about answering questions like that because people take them out of context and think that we think we're greater we're not greater but the word is because the word is sufficient for the day and so we are in a more wicked age so the word is more effective in our day and so this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age amen see and we don't want to go to seed on this but my brother and sister we got to recognize that God knew exactly what it would take for you and I to go home and he's come down and uh anointed a prophet to speak the words to take it that we're not just here uh trying to survive I hear this sometimes out of the mouth of individuals and we can just get through leysia I'm here to tell you tonight we've already got through leoda we are not waiting to get through the spirit and Conquer leoda God is already put his word in the heart of the Bride she's already passed through leod deia she's now in the bride age my brother and sister no no wife or or no sister would would put on a white dress and all of that and come and stand here in front of the congregation on a Sunday morning hoping a bridegroom would show up she's there in that position because it's been revealed to her it's been uh spoken and it's been committed and she's here as a bride knowing the bridegroom is Desiring her and has that uh commitment already been made and so the Bride of this age is not here trying to conquer leoda not trying to overcome leoda we have a bridegroom that said come away my love amen and we've already moved beyond the leoda even though we're still influenced by the spirits of it but part of that's our own fault because we have left many promises of God laying there because we say well I'm not worthy how many of us have said that before I'm not worthy if God said you're worthy take a hold of the promise grip that and take that and hold on to that and use that to be an overcomer amen so uh we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he tried to tell them you're dead to that and you cannot have that now this is a a beautiful uh sermon and there's much more but you know you can't just come here and we might as well play the tape if we're going to just read quote after quote on it but you look at this see my brother and sister I'm going to make what might seem like a little bit of a radical approach we need to be dead to the Past amen We're Not Looking Back to Egypt as as Israel did at the Red Sea we have many challenges and sometimes we have many failures and we come up short but it's time my brother and sister you know I know why sister Jerry's chuckling we had Grace kids the other night at the house and we took a couple blue blankets and we uh our sheets and we created our own Red Sea and The Parting of it and it was kind of interesting because the kids were stumbling over the sheet and anyway generally it was just a fun time with the little kids but you look at my brother and sister we can't be like them and look back we're sold out and if we're not sold out well serious troubles ahead imagine what it would be if they could have stood there on that day and said you know what what you should do is probably just go hold up a white sheet and go back to uh um the Pharaoh soldiers and tell them I want to go back but you see I hope you follow me even then for them at that time if God had allowed him to do that it was too late those Egyptian Army was there to kill them that's right right you wonder why people and I'm not like oh raw raw the message don't misunderstand me but you wonder why people when they depart their lives turn into shambles because the Pharaoh's Army is not there to let him return back to making bricks he's there to kill them and we see it happen again and again and again but no one intended for it to be that way amen so we need to just face the fact that when God called us I'm not talking about a man calling you emotion calling you or some movement calling you I'm talking about God calling you we need to become dead to everything else we need to just move beyond that and be dead to that and uh because God's going to say you can't have that you don't you don't have that amen now the word tells us in this day now this is the bride age right we're in this time the scripture tells us that the Mysteries and I've got it here in my notes the word would slash should so you see when you take that in the right definition and it said should be finished it is actually declaring it would be finished it will be done it's not a possibility uh a possibility of not but it is fully done so the Mysteries should be fulfilled and you know uh there is a lot I I don't know about you let me only speak for myself there's a lot in scripture I still don't understand I I look in the scripture and God by his grace and mercy I think you'll agree with me there's things that we we don't understand and then a period of time goes by and suddenly amen thank you Lord there it is it's before us now did we figure it out oh my brother and sister if we spend all of our life life the rest of our lives trying to figure it out we can't figure it out but God says I will put every piece of the mystery in its correct position in its correct time and that's very important amen so we're looking at the details following falling in place now you know I read a quote to you maybe that was last Wednesday where brother Braham says you know uh that God had pulled back from that because the people have been saying oh he's going to come here and he's going to come like this and it's going to be this and it's going to be that we don't want to be those kind of people but I'll tell you if if you just give me a little pass for lack of good wording sometimes you feel that way because you see these things these world events coming to place they're coming to Bear they're coming to fulfillment fruition and and we don't really you know know I mean the pope he's he's got one foot on a oh I shouldn't make humor like that I don't know which way to express that he's got one foot in the grave and one foot on you guys know the rest of that yeah so is he the last Pope supposedly there's only one spot left so maybe the last Pope doesn't need a place to be buried in the Basilica oh we could we were joking the other night like well conspiracy we're not conspiracy theorists but but you see my brother and sister I want to ask you does it really matter the Pope's condition what really matters is our Condition it's not where he's at it's where we're at and so as we get focused on some of those things we can make assumptions but those assumptions can be misguided misplaced so as we look at this and and the prophet of God uh had many Visions my brother and sister and there were times that he himself was uncertain of what the vision actually meant and he had to wait for the Lord to interpret those visions and you know here we are in this life right now here tonight we misinterpret God's vision for our life and we will end up with a entirely different result we have to wait just like the Prophet did and let the Lord interpret the vision amen cuz if we let the Lord interpret the vision all responsibility of that Vision falls back Upon Our God but when we misinterpret the vision uh you know there's been a lot I'm not here to go into those tonight but people say well the Lord told me and my brother and sister sometimes it's just totally against the word of God but they're saying God told me God told me to go against the word and so you know my brother and sister you know here again just to to clinch that nail the prophet of God said God will never lead you away from his word right so you look at that you wonder sometimes so someone's maybe misinterpreting the vision and they're going to end up with a different results now on The Superficial level missing something you know I never even shared it with my wife but I had a dream here a while back and I for sure hope that dream doesn't come to pass cuz I was hanging on the edge of something and something fell over and smashed both of my hands and the dream ended right there now did that smashing of my hands give me Supernatural strength to crawl back up on top or was it symbolism that I was fixing to get my hands smashed but you see when you eat too much rich food too late at night and then you're going to guide Your Life by One Singular event see it doesn't even make sense when we make light of it that way it doesn't even make sense but people find themselves caught but what do you do you have a dream that's kind of crazy but there's something about it you don't know what you do is you take that thing and the prophet of God told us you take it back to the word and then let God interpret it amen otherwise it could just be a crazy dream amen so it's there you look at this and a superficial IAL level it doesn't matter but in a deeper spiritual level we need to have an understanding of the vision that God has placed in you and I as it unfolds and when is unfolding according to the word you will find yourself more spiritually stable you'll find yourself with a a greater Victory you'll find there's so many things I could put in here but I I don't want to just belabor that but you're going to find that these things when God deals with you and it is the Lord every is coming back and it has an anchor point and when it has an anchor Point you're actually even if it's incorrection going to be blessed by that when the vision goes off and becomes as it were heresy uh uh you know it it it starts to do and and you know things just can get difficult you look at it and say why why is this brother or sister doing this but you'll see that often times they're not actually waiting for God to open the vision to them they're taking what they understand at the moment going forward with that assuming that God's going to unfold it all after they're already in motion but God wants you to take it back to the word and if God says go do this then the Lord will make a way for that amen now you know we're living in today the Mysteries are supposed to be fulfilled I want to know as the third pull been fulfilled any of you ever have a third Pole Experience yeah I think this church ought to shout with an amen amen because that's that's the word coming to pass in your presence and mystery amen uh being fulfilled you know is coming to a fuller understanding of Christ in you amen my brother and sister Christ in you the hope of glory is a much greater mystery than we think because God has been so gracious to us to open the word and we see it because we're already can I use the word pre-programmed to believe let's go down the street this is church Row in NAA right here let's go down the street let's walk into some of these churches and start talking to them about the third pole they will tell you you're crazy but what has the third poll done for you and I it's brought us into greater Revelation amen now think about it mystery being fulfilled how many times we say here that we are the word you realize how deep that is yes sir we're not just men and women following saying well we're Christians were following the Lord Jesus Christ you see this has taken this a way deeper step and brought us into a place that we have come to recognize that we actually are the word made manifest in this day and I tell you my brother and sister it's not to go negative here but if this message is not correct it it is not the the the God's movement of this day then please I beg you take me to it that's right absolutely the critics would say this is this is this and this is this I I can't find anywhere where the word or the prophet said follow me meaning William Bram in fact he specifically says I don't want you to follow me that's right so we look at this and when we realize that if this is not the truth then Lord this is my prayer constantly Lord lead me and guide me to all truth and I believe he'll do that so if there's greater truth out here somewhere my brother and sister I believe God is obligated if I could put it that way Lord please forgive me if I worded it wrong but I he obligated himself to take us to the truth which means that if this is not it he would be taking us somewhere else but my brother and sister all of these prophets and all of these movements and all of these great men are constantly coming to not because there's nothing that's going to suplantar the word amen yeah we don't think about it as being a great mystery sometimes it's like well okay yes praise God we're the word but do you realize my brother and sister just like to say Jesus is the Christ you must have the Holy Ghost to honestly say that he is the Christ and it comes to a place that to be able to recognize that we are the word we have to have the Holy Ghost and when you have the Holy Ghost you start to recognize that this is not about big buildings this is not about all this other stuff this is about our relationship with Jesus Christ so I want to ask you is this reality or symbolism reality it's reality amen I've been told that it's symbolism not that long ago I had somebody tell me I believe that this and this and this is is symbolism and I told them you just keep on looking for the symbols I'm looking for Christ amen the reality the truth the word and the bride is the reality amen now that's a statement I'm going to make like that that might be misunderstood people can put the spin on it but the bride of Christ is the reality of the revealed word in this hour amen God doesn't need something to confirm he is God they people who believe he is God believe he is God and those who don't want to believe he is God don't believe he is God it won't change whether he's God or not so what God come down he says I'm going to express myself in my bride and here again you want to make a connection real quick the prophet of God says you want to know what kind of man a person is look at his wife you want to know what kind of church it is look at the sisters amen right that's right right Lord help us too simple no not too simple pretty straightforward actually now in the seven Church age Philadelphian Church age brother brandham says here uh but let me say this our Lord is not defeated men claim to open the door to God and shut that door but they are liars you know we even have a few of those around the message yes sir H I'm here tonight to preach this Revelation to you I'm sorry God gives a revelation no man's going to teach the revelation of Jesus Christ to you amen all that the father has given him will come to him and he that cometh to him in no wise will be cast out this should make us heart our hearts Rejoice he will lose none of them John 6: 37-39 and when that last elected member uh to the body of Christ comes in then will our Lord appear the Key of David was not David the king of Israel all Israel and is not Jesus the son of David according to the fact that he still uh will sit upon the throne of David in the Millennium and Reign and rule over his Heritage surely so the Key of David S signifies that it is Jesus who will bring in the Millennium amen now most of you would not really be familiar with this but and and you know a last uh uh bit of History you know there's been Men passed right through this part of the world that said that they were given the authority sister Jerry and I just a second here we're given personal invitation to the Millennium and I told them well I'm sorry but I already have an invitation to the Millennium I don't need your invitation because I've got an invitation of the one who actually is authorized to give the invitation but you see how men can come to this positions where they they feel like they are so divinely appointed to declare who will be and who won't be but look at what the prophet's saying here now uh that that this is this position and uh uh kind of the going back but it's all right uh he who has the keys to death and hell will raise up his own that they may share in his reign of righteousness upon the Earth how wonderful that our Lord has all the answers truly in him are all the promises of God fulfilled truly by being in him we are HS to what he has purchased for us yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once as a father he was surrounded by Angels the archangels cherim seraphim the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such was his Holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him I want you to see that sometimes times I feel like not me but I it just seems like we're kind of missing a little something cuz here's a holy God that all of the archangels seraphim every one of them holy holy holy and then God says I am going to do something a little different I'm going to come down in my church now if we left all that explanation off and I ask you where is the Church of the Living God we wouldn't need to go pointing off somewhere to the east to the west to the North or the South we wouldn't need to travel to Israel we wouldn't need to to travel to some place that maybe might be a message Mecca we would recognize because we are students of the Bible that we are the Tabernacle we are the kingdom we are the dwelling place and so look at this right here amen we see that this is uh such a position that they were there and no could no one could approach God uh without being there approach him properly but he says but now we see him in the church sharing his own Holiness with us my this this is a greatest gift a greatest favor that mankind could ever have that God would come and and pardon me for using such a simple thing but he would come and say here I want to share my Holiness with you oh my brother and sister that is no small thing people are saying where's the supernatural things of God I would say that God would choose to share his Holiness with you and I is a supernatural thing amen it's not some trivial thing to be glossed over amen sharing his own Holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteous of God see how privileged our position is it is not a menial thing oh my family just believes the message or you know my husband or my wife or my parents my brother and sister this is an incredible thing God has given to us no gift of value of intrinsic value on the earth could equal the gift God has given us that he has given us his Holiness and his righteousness amen yes and there he stands Jesus perfect everything lily of the valley perfect bright and Morning Star perfect the fairest of 10,000 Alpha and Omega root and offspring of David father son Holy Ghost the all in all Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince of Peace do we realize my brothers and sisters this is not a Doctrine to be argued over this is a gift a revelation of Jesus Christ personally granted and given to you and I oh my you know brother Bram uses that example of of the President coming to your house my brother and sister we have pardon the pun Trump that we've got the King of Kings the perfect one has come to our house amen and the prophet goes on when he's giving that story he's talking about how that that we would invite him in and we would give him the very best that we have should we not invite him in and give him the very best that we have amen hallelujah now we just hurry along here tonight in him is perfect fulfillment though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of Glory in the midst of the church he stands and we will sing his praise for he is the mighty conqueror is head over the church which is his bride amen we by Grace already know that but it just to me never ceases to be so incredible that he would come and say I'm going to pour everything that I am into my church amen are we acting on everything he's giving us are we accepting it that's it now I'm not even going to use sin as a reason that it's not working unless you would call it our refusal to acknowledge God's view of us he says you are perfect that I can pour myself the most holy into you that's how we should be looking at this picture not we constantly trying to be good enough he's already declared you good enough right it's time for us to stand up and say you know what Lord I accept everything you said about me amen we could go lovely analogy of a man courting a young woman and uh in this little story the young woman uh is not necessarily the prettiest girl around but when this young man fell in love with her he said you are the most beautiful girl to me and then it goes on to explain how the girl being intelligent looked around and said there's so many more that are much more beautiful than I am but do you see she was judging his word words by her perspective right right he was judging her by his heart that's right and we have to accept our Lord Jesus Christ view of us that's it amen otherwise we'll come up the conclusion that we're not good enough y that's right we can't do this he's not asking us to judge ourselves by humanistic Behavior he's asking us to judge oursel by what he himself has declared and he has as we've shared tonight that we are righteous and we Are Holy amen amen let that be our New Perspective let that be how we judge the the trajectory of our Christian walk amen sorry I hear just a little bit dry throat somebody helped me I lost my place [Music] I find this humorous in the midst of the church he stands we sing his praise for his mighty conqueror's head over the church which is his bride he bought that bride some people would consider that an insult my brother and sister that just means that he chose you out of the millions of people on the Earth he chose you you to me that's so incredible so incredible he is our King and I stopped this quote right here out of the Philadelphian Church age right here because this is really the point I want to make he is our King can we say Amen to that and we are his kingdom amen wow if we are his King Kingdom my brother and sister we're not just a bunch of miserable people in this age trying to struggle to serve God faithfully and hoping we can make I hope I can make a Rapture you are his kingdom and a king occupies his kingdom he possesses it it's his authority over it it's his leadership it's his guidance and it's it's his fruits that he takes from his own kingdom oh we ought to realize as this vision is unfolding before us nothing new tonight I don't have anything spectacular I'm here to remind you you are his kingdom amen and he's not going to abandon his kingdom for something else he's not going to run off and leave his kingdom you are the very purpose amen of the Rapture amen hallelujah I hope you can catch what I'm saying here in this little statement the vision is truly unfolded when we see no separation between ourselves and Jesus Christ if we still see separation between us and Jesus Christ the vision is not fully revealed to you that's right he come to make his bride he to make the church his bride and his bride is one with him let's be reminded of that on the good days Amen on the bad days we need to be reminded that we are one with Jesus Christ you say I've got problems he accounted for your problem amen he already made allowance for our flesh and our weakness and our Frailty and as one brother says our stupidity he's already accounted for that amen now I need to hurry along here God identifying himself by his characteristics brother Bram says this Jesus said in the 17th chapter of St Luke as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed when Revelation is unfolding itself in the days when the world will be like Sodom what will it be so Revelation unfolding itself what will that Revelation look like what will we see when that Revelation is unfolded in the day that it looks like Sodom wouldn't that be today yes it is y this is the season this is the time this is the time that Sodom has truly started to express itself the characteristic of that scripture being fulfilled God is God identifying himself by his characteristic characteristic that he's always been he cannot leave that amen here again a little homework go read some more of that get the full context of it but you see my brother and sister when God said that this is how I'm going to reveal myself we've come down to this Sodom age he didn't suddenly decide he's got a new program you know we don't need the equivalent sorry to even use the words but we don't need Dei in the church we don't need to come some kind of diverse deal that we need to attract these people if the gospel itself in its purest form will not attract them nothing will attract them to Christ himself and so we don't need a program to attract them what we need is the Worden let the word attract them cuz when the word wins them they are one but if we just convince them they'll soon be convinced differently so we're seeing the vision has there ever been a day I I've said this to the church to you guys before that years ago I've thought man we are in the time look at this everything looks like Sodom didn't have a clue did not have a clue and I'm going to say it again it sure looks like Sodom but here again I might not have a clue but what I do know that I can certify to you is that we're a lot closer to that Sodom Spirit than we were 10 years ago right five years ago yeah wait maybe even a year or two that's exactly right see it's manifesting itself now pardon me to put the words this way but we thought Sodom was maybe back in that day just a a few people kind of Floy and a few whatever my brother and sister it was de Ary that's right it was absolute filth that's right and we are headed back as a society there's some side streets here but we'll we'll leave them so it's coming my brother and sister brother Brown says here in questions answers on Genesis 1953 uh we don't have a quote I don't believe I put that on that list god making Eve and Adam and Eve at the same time the only thing he made was the supernatural the spirit of Adam and the spirit of Eve the man and woman then when he made put Adam in here it wasn't good for see it's God's picture unfolding all the time amen and I'm glad of that because I tell you if some of the things in our life had been flashed before us years ago we would have been so stunned we could not have continued we would have just faltered under but you see God's unfolding and every time Satan raises his standard God raises his standard and God's standard has always been higher than Satan's standard we don't have to worry about being overflowed overrun overdone right we can just stand and let God do what he does and Satan will do what he does but the Lord's already given us the answer showed us the victory is already ours amen we don't have to hope for victory we're not praying for victory we have Victory amen see it's God's picture unfolding all the time everything like this it's just coming right down just unfolding right out coming out through the Millennium Over Yonder right into eternity god's picture just unfolding God unfolding himself we're not sitting here tonight I know brother and sisters sometimes good days bad days I certainly confess I have my own but my brother and sister we really need to come to the place we realize God's already expressed himself Amen in you amen can you imagine I mean it should be be under comprehension that God would step down into human flesh you and I and then say I just don't know if I can make it yeah I don't know that I can over come Satan's a tougher adversary than than I thought no my brother and sister we need to come to a full comprehension and I just want to sum this right down sister via would come I want to sum this right down we need to look at this the way God Amen looks at it that's right and to him the victory was one a millennia ago he's not looking for going to hopefully be victorious hopefully going to overcome the spirit of the age hopefully we're going to no it's settled it's finished all we got to do is just be faithful and let him I made this joke before and I don't really say it as a joke but there was some uh music artist said you know Lord Jesus Take the Wheel sang some song Jesus Take the Wheel the meantime they've got one foot on The Brak and one foot on the gas but Lord you can have the wheel it's time for us to just give it all to him that's right and just say Lord the victory's already been given to us we're already Sons we're already daughters we're already in our Victory amen amen hallelujah amen you see where's the vision unfolding so many people are looking for some Supernatural thing to take place out here we're in these special meetings I just heard this just recently we're in these meetings expecting the supernatural to take place and I'm not criticizing these people I believe I understand where they were coming from but it struck me the Supernatural is here that's right it's already taking place that's right amen just the very fact that we can stand in this day amen Overcomers in this day the Supernatural is manifested hallelujah my brother and sister you know pardon me for this expression but people are looking through the supernatural to be something on the order of those people who lay on those beds of nails or walk across the red hot coals and they would say praise God that was Supernatural no Supernatural is taking place right here tonight amen age of Leo DEA bride age Sons and Daughters of God are finding Victory amen the song that we sang get my words right it was getting harder was more than I could bear I felt like giving over can we say Amen to that but you know there's something in you can't that's right it's that simple we're not going to go out and tempt the Lord's calling in our life but simply sister Sue's testimony I I just love that she's always just reminding me this Paul I have come too far to give up now let that be our Mantra I've come too far amen could we just stand maybe sing a song uh we'd have to ask a song leader to sing a song cuz I literally have not one single song but my brother and sister the vision is unfolding yes sir in the bride yes sir this true church this is where the Visions unfolding and as I close and we'll let brother Isaac lead us in a song or two I heard this statement said once I've never voiced it before because it seems kind of outlandish but catch this it's not boasting if it's true that's right I'm
