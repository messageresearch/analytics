something wrong with her cat and she's worried and so i go look at the cat and her eyes all swole right out so i open it up and i know enough about anatomy to say that her eyeball was punctured very

i sing how great are you truly we serve an awesome part amen how blessed we are my brother and sisters who have a true revelation of jesus christ in the day that we live in amen i just want to take just a moment to just make sure that we all have clarity starting officially i think it's friday saturday sunday you might call it the services on the mountain out of unity oregon and to all those that are able to come whether you're a camper or not i think there's a motel in prairie city and for those who are not able to come but would like to come on sunday i think it would be well worth the time for you to drive up there i don't know the exact amount of time i think it's actually a couple hours uh but uh just to make clear that everyone who desires to come obviously this is not a closed service and for those who can't uh make it there brother david will be preaching here in the tabernacle on sunday so we will have church here for those who are not able to go up there and uh i know my brother chris is hard and while this might catch some of us a little off guard this is something that's a burden on his heart that he would like if the lord would grant to do every year so maybe we come to the house of god to get converted from our old man and i hope you don't mind a moment of humor here but maybe some of you can be converted into and um so i believe we'll have a lovely time there on the mountain we're not going there just to goof off not going there some of you may take a fishing pole some of you may bring your hiking shoes whatever it might be but we want to go up there to just have a lovely time of fellowship together and to worship the lord so uh just the the times i don't know exactly if there was clarified times but i know there'll be uh saints there friday saturday sunday so whatever works for you so brother david has taken it upon himself and i appreciate that we had a lengthy conversation over uh the need to have the doors of the tabernacle open for those so we don't want to if you're not a camper you're shut out we want to leave that door open for each one to be able to worship this this weekend so um i i had one more announcement when you get over my age you should write things down well if the lord wants us to remember that um we certainly will so uh many needs my brother and sister oh i know what i was going to say brother brother jason and i had a laugh in the back room and to those of you that heard brother chris's wednesday sermon and he was talking about message traditions and i had quite a sense of humor over that because it struck me the very evening because sister jerry turned in an unspoken request and brother chris speaks about that he says you know now these message traditions we have unspoken requests and i i don't say this in defense of me but i just want you to understand that sometimes when the pastor says he has an unspoken request you should say thank you lord that it's unspoken because some of you i would be saying and i'm speaking about you and speaking about you and i'm speaking about you and i want god to come down and deal with you so i i just choose to leave it unspoken amen so i appreciated the point brother chris was making right we don't want to fall into ruts but i think there is a time for the unspoken request and and uh we should take them serious it's really the reason i bring this up don't just gloss over it and say well okay yeah that that's just something unstated um many times they're serious enough and many times they deal with you and so let's just hold those unspoken requests up just as important as though it was your request amen let's turn in our bibles this morning amen today is the fourth of july and my brother and sister there's many a man that died on a battlefield we have memorial day for those remembrances but for the liberty that we as a nation get to celebrate there is many a man died upon a battlefield to preserve that liberty and for the liberty that we have as sons and daughters of god many a man woman boy and girl has stood and faced the opposition and overcome it in the name of jesus christ so while we'll celebrate today the liberty we have as a people in a nation and you'll see how that satan is coming by prophecy to destroy the liberty of our nation he so much more so wants to destroy your liberty in jesus christ whether now this isn't just for young people but my brother and sister the spirit of the age is coming down and our young people face a special battle they go to the university they go to the high school they go to the middle school and satan's trying to erode their faith in god and displace it with something there a cynical attitude or a lackadaisical attitude and my brother and sister this liberty we have in jesus christ is worth fighting for amen don't give up keep fighting young people if the devil's been hammering on you don't give up keep fighting you young married couples amen tony reagan one time many years ago says you know when mothers have all them little babies and they spend time in the cry room and fussing with their children and whatever he said there's a time and i don't remember his exact words but it's like there's a span of time it's almost like our mothers are backslid because they're hardly hearing the preaching of the word taking care of your children but god has a special dispensation upon you because you're fulfilling the word amen and so he come and he sustained you in that time and i apply that to us whatever we're facing today don't give up just keep facing and claim the liberty we have in jesus christ because god's got a dispensation for you amen he will pour out what you need when you need it if you don't give up hallelujah amen let's turn our bibles this morning i want to speak to you on subjected to another will and uh you know sometime it's interesting hope your parents don't mind but it's interesting to watch the battle between the will of a mother and her child it's quite a contest sometimes you don't know who to root for but you'll find my brother and sister that the holy spirit the will of god will always take you into the will which is his worth that's right so when we look for the battle of the wheels if you say well brother paul i'm not sure well just take what your desire is back to the word of god and if it fits in the word pursue it if it doesn't fit in the word don't that's right we were talking one day just a remembrance of this talking one day about puzzles and i was not aware i think it was sister ruth shared this with me and have a puzzle that's got a picture on each side and it's the exact same cut but an entirely different picture on the other side of the piece it's now left to you and i to determine which side we want to reflect so you can put the peace in place destroy the whole picture that you can by the will of god put it in place and finish the picture that's right so we're here because the author and finish of our faith has come and he's not here to make us religious he's come here to make us sons and daughters of god hallelujah let's turn to ii timothy and uh we'll just take our context out of ii timothy the second chapter verses 19 through 26. and then god bless you brother bob sister joanne been thinking about you and just uh feel guilty that i don't come knock on your door but also i'm concerned because we go through the cycle of the cough snorts and sneezes at our house and we we don't want to inadvertently share that amen second timothy 2 19 to 26 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his amen and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every i want to emphasize that every good work flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace and with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle until all men out to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god prayed venture would give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will amen heavenly father we ask you lord for your blessings upon the word today for your blessings upon this service father take these things that have been upon our heart lord apply them correctly to the needs of your people guide us we pray today in the name of jesus christ amen you may be feared now as i made comment there of the battle of the wills it is interesting my brother and sister that we see from the very birth of a child now the prophet of god talks about how that a child's only way to communicate a need is to cry to cry out and he expresses that that is also the way that a son or daughter of god expresses their need to god we don't want to be cold indifferent formal we don't want to approach god as though he was our i was thinking this brother manasseh as a personal shopper we don't want to come and say now lord i need you to go get this this and this for me my brother and sister but we need to learn to cry out from our heart to be able to express from the very depths of our heart the things that we desire and god says that he would answer the very desires of your heart give you the desires of your heart because one he knows my brother and sister that you having his heart will not be asking for something that is uh unnecessary as it were things that would be detrimental but your heart is crying to be closer to the lord and i believe we can say amen to that and so we see these children and the battle of the wills that is there and you know it is there that we find and and this is not going to be a lesson on parenting this morning but we'll find that when parents constantly give in to the will of their children they will raise a very headstrong and stubborn children that become headstrong and stubborn teenagers and adults and on into life and ultimately we realize my brother and sister that while we're not here to break the spirit of a child to make them some completely submissive you know um but it is it is that we need to realize there's a time that it's time for us to give in to the will amen whether it be of our parents uh or of the lord and so we see this and we see certainly in the day that we're living in satan's desire to exert his will on humanity the scripture says that there would come a day that they would call good evil and evil good and we find that is only satan exerting his will because whatever god said now my brother and sister sorry for quoting brother donnie but these things are upon our mind and you know brother donnie one time made a statement he says now look at how the world or the spirit of the world is he said if the word of god called and he uses a young sister for an example if the word of god called our sister gabriella to have her nose pierced her cheek pierced her lip pierced and her ears full of studs and for her head of a stud in her forehead and her hair to be purple then the devil would have her sitting here today with uncut hair dressed modestly looking like that you see that is what it is it's simply satan opposing the will of god and so it's not my brother and sister because look young people are they pretty studs through the nose the lip the ears the cheeks the weird colored hair look i don't want to sound carnal but i'm just a normal human i find nothing attractive about that so what is it there's an anointing that's there but that example my brother and sister if god called for uh our daughters of god to look like that then the satan would have him there with uncut hair long dress sitting in church because he's opposed to the will of god he's opposed to that and so everything that he's doing it's not relevant of what i want or what i feel but to look at the battle of the wills to see how it is that satan has come and in everything that god is doing satan is opposed to that and working against that amen and so as he goes to exert his will on humanity amen he has come to the place that he has pushed and he has influenced and he has brought the culture to such a place my brother and sister now you know i won't go into explanation on this but i i i look at things in a pretty broad view as far as when i'm studying to understand thoughts that i have and to express them and to pray over them of what i speak and don't speak and you know my brother and sister you look at this and and you'll find in the world today we have a lot of voices we have a lot of influence of people saying they're representing god and speaking for god and acting out on behalf of god but yet everything about them now this sounds judgmental but i don't mean it that way because it's what the word says right that's what's important and and so they're there saying i represent god and men with long hair i represent god and women with hair cut off i represent god and you have all of these different influences i won't go into all the explanation of it but you have all these influences but it is directly opposed i'm representing god but i'm opposed to his word see this won't work my brother and sister but the anointing of the day is so strong that people will say oh uh you know i know the bible forbids it but but you don't understand our sister that pastors our church is special what is it the word said there'd be a strong illusion in the day that we live in where they would call right wrong and wrong right and they would go on believing because every man is right in his own eyes and and they push into that and what we see is not against the individuals don't misunderstand me today we're not against the individual i have some friends that you guys might be shocked that i call them friends but my brother and sister it's the spirit of the day because satan is here slowly but surely pushing his will upon the people and the prophet of god said many times the problems our churches have is because the pastor doesn't have a backbone i ask you pray for me that i will have a backbone that i will stand on the word of god whether i feel popular or not whether i feel accepted or not that we have a backbone enough to say this is truth and this is not amen and the prophet of god said the compromise of the church started in the pulpit amen their stories in brother branham's ministry one of them is a jewish rabbi they said if i stood for that i would be on the street amen what was it his will to stand with the word of god was weaker than his will to have support in his old age to have a nice house a nice car a good retirement that's right oh my would this be a good time church to talk about my retirement program i think it would i've got a mansion just over the hilltop i've got a provision in the kingdom of god that he said i will never leave you i will never forsake you i take care of the sparrow i will take care of you [Music] oh hallelujah what a retirement the prophet of god said you know they're there he says what about insurance what about this what about that i have assurance oh his wife there now look bill what are you doing i didn't say i have insurance i have assurance what a retirement program to know that we are walking in the will of almighty god not subject to the will of the devil not subject to the whim and the will of the world but under the anointing of the word for our hour we can stand and say thank you lord that even in hard times i am in the will of god and my heart's desire is to live in the will of god hallelujah amen you see we we come and this struck me in such a way you know that we just things become familiar to us right some would call it cliches i pray we never use this message we might repeat things but never let it just be a cliche let every word that we speak and every thought that we think be founded in the word of god not just something that sounds good that we repeat but we look and see in the time as satan exerts his will upon the world prophecy says my brother and sister that it would cause kings and kingdoms to fall he causes the people to come and give their treasure that's everything they hold dear we oftentimes read that scripture and think okay they're throwing their cash that might be right you know i i say this a little bit humorous a little bit facetious uh church do do we need to just go ahead and put the credit card machines on the back of the uh pew because uh research has proven that people give between 15 and 20 15 and 27 percent more money in offerings and ties if they can swipe it on a car well i just don't have time to give something offering so we're going to make it convenient for you no really what they're doing is they're looking for the 15 to 27 percent that's right they're not they're not looking to make it convenient for because if we're going to make the message convenient we'll set you all up with a nice little deal and you can sit at home in your recliner with your bunny slippers and eat popcorn during church that's what's convenient yes god didn't say i'm gonna have a convenient gospel for you he said i'm gonna have a gospel that changes your life a dynamic gospel a gospel that will shake you out of your rot and shake you out of the world that you were in and cause you to rise up to be who i called you to be not to be what is convenient think about it everywhere we go is convenience i rode with sister jerry she went and picked up her groceries at walmart i don't know that it gets more convenient than that we sit in the car with the ac on and we watch this little girl sweating pushing the cart out and then she's unloading it in the back of our car and then as she's been trained to do she comes do you want me to close the tailgate oh no we can do that ourself where are we headed saints an on-demand gospel go to grace nampa.org and have a selection happy sermon corrective sermon sermon i won't sleep through sermon i will sleep through i can just click on whichever one i feel no see this is not what god called for god said you know what i want you to come i want you to put up with a man you might say why in the world did god call that man i don't know either but it's not about convenience amen but while this will is being exerted he has become the god of this evil age he has come to where he dominates everything my brother and sister we can have and i won't go into the details you you know what i'm talking about we can have perversion unpunished and we can have good things then be censored the god of this evil age is there under in the influence and people there believe it was so what did this come from my brother and sister because somebody deluded the word of god someone started watering it down because it took so many people and so much money to keep the church alive and keep it all functioning we got to keep the pew full well i'll tell you what i will go by that quote that's on my my desk there in the office there i'd rather preach to two people and be right in the eyes of the lord than to preach to 10 million and have to compromise hallelujah and how much more so that we could sit here in the tabernacle this morning and sit here with saints of lack precious faith that just want the pure word of god without the will of the devil the god of this evil age bringing his influence now look brother branham first speaks of this now you know sometimes we just take things for granted and when i just felt an unction to really bring this out and you realize brother branham doesn't really touch on this and and i'll bring you a quote here in just a second so you'll understand but brother branham doesn't teach or speak on god of this evil age until uh the eighth month that's uh what september august okay see thank you august of 1965 all of his ministry he's not dealing with god of this evil age he's not now he is dealing with it you know what i'm saying he's not bringing out and vocalizing it putting a god of this evil age but we come now to august um uh oh excuse me my mind's just racing first day of august 1965. now brother branham says right here um hallelujah well where we have brothers here we go now listen for satan is not spoken as a god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of of the god of the age of noah he wasn't spoke of of the god of the age of moses the god of the age of elijah but this evil age he is oh don't miss it he is the god of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it that is the real deception is that they believe they are worshiping god but the image my brother and sister that's been put before him has been tarnished it's been changed it's been modified it's been painted as it were slightly different i remember one time a story of a man that was offered some famous painting like a vincent van gaal or something like that and and the man was there and there they were pressuring him you know just a limited offering here to you and if you pass it up it is there and the man then secretly called a friend who was a a expert on paintings and said come here and look at this and he keeps looking and keeps looking until his friend comes and when his friend comes in obviously the people he's dealing with are not happy but here's now i hope you get this here is a man who knows what he's looking at this is a man that has been schooled and understand what it is and he walks into the room and they pull the velvet from the picture and he says it's a fortress turns around and walks out and the man insisted no this is an original this is original so the man says my friend says it's a forgery it's a forgery and he walks out and he catches up with his friend he says how do you know it was a forgery and he said oh it might be worth buying because it is a masterpiece of a forgery and then he proceeds to name off a detail and a detail and a detail that's not correct but would have fooled any man believing for just a few million he could own a vincent van gogh just like the devil today has said hey you can get eternal life for signing your name on the book at grace tabernacle just minor details but one that has been schooled in the word of god recognizes it's not just an attendance record a name a membership book it's our life amen that's what we give for eternal life is our life he's already given his life we don't have to try to crucify christ again we don't have to try to go back and find the foundation of our salvation or the foundation of eternal life we don't have to do that what we have to do is come and ascribe to what the foundation of eternal life said we must do and that is to give our life yes amen amen that's right worship by millions billions of people and they don't know it but let's let this scripture amen now i don't mean to say this critically but i believe this is something it's just ramping up saints many of you are isolated from these things and i say that is good but it is ramping up in our midst of people saying well you just have to this and you just have to that i'm sorry my brother and sister it says let's let the scripture amen there's where the prophet of god took us back he didn't say take it back to what i said take it back to what this one said or what that one said constantly he affirms to us take it back to the bible and then he says don't let the bible be of any man's private interpretation so we have to take it back to the infallible word of god amen so let's let the scripture uncover this morning who is the god of the age amen and so we're we're not going to kind of go quite that direction you're believers you've been around you've been up and down the block amen you know these things but the very next service that he preaches is the same day in the evening and it is events made clear by prophets now i'm telling you my brother and sister we should be thrilled of the events that are being made clear by prophecy because prophecy is what is revealing who you are amen amen the prophecy of the word declaring that there will be a righteous and holy bride standing in the last days giving praise glory and honor to god living the word out becoming the word made flesh this is what the word says my brother and sister and that is what we are doing this is what is happening to you and i is we are actually coming to the place that we are the literal fulfillment of the word of god in our day now look i don't speak this critically but some people are believing the prophet must come back to bring this special anointing my brother and sister to get a bride into the rapture but do you realize the prophet of god himself in the message spoke over and over and over again things like my ministry will soon be finished amen that's right are we gonna bring him back against god's will to get us into rapturing faith when he already gave us everything we need to make a rapture and the word of god has been opened with rapturing faith for you and i to take a hold of that your midnight hour your time of prayer your reading of the bible studying of the message there is the unfolding of rapturing faith it won't be some man saying now you do this this and this and you'll make a rapture unless he's telling you pray read your bible and surrender yourself to christ then that might be the influence but to give you some kind of recipe that's right now here we are the evening service brother branham for the first time in the morning brings out the god of this evil age lays it out never before it's this age amen this is the age that satan becomes the god of then in the evening service he says and when you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of sodom see the church world all going into the worship can i just speak blunt this morning we got way too many message people ascribing to hillsong amen and two i i i won't even go um i'll stop right there sorry i mentioned their name but we got long-haired people that you just click on the soundtrack and you're like that's so beautiful but when you see it in person you're seeing these people men long hair women short hair dressed vulgarly on that singing about the righteousness of god something's wrong something's out of kelter my brother and sister why because the god of this age has now been redefined you understand that they took god from in front of the people they put him back behind the veil and hid him for a while and then when they reintroduced him he was a different god but all they knew was god's here god's here that must be god they got a god that's like old grandfather kitties just love grandpa i'll buy you presents i'll tell you how much i love you well my grandchildren if they were vocal enough to tell you will tell you i'm not a very good old grandpa do that again i'm going to whip your head and i mean it yeah that's it because we're not trying to raise good children we're trying to raise good adults unless of course you want to keep your kid you imagine how much damage you do to a boy he's now eight years old and you still insist he wears a diaper and mama gets to go out and grab it on the back and peek in it no sir by the time he gets up there old enough he's gonna say i'll run away from home before i'll put up with this any longer but you see what's happening they're keeping the church so immature it don't even know by the word how to judge whether it's god or not they're just like oh this is god this is god i felt it well i'll tell you what if i hear one more person come to me and say well i just feel you're going to hear a scream echo upon the hills of this valley i don't care what you feel excuse me for yelling i don't want you to feel like i'm intimidating show me one place in the word i feel i feel i feel in case someone thinks i'm being aggressive this morning i'm actually just very happy because this word is alive amen and it's real and something inside of us is saying amen amen amen and ben the god of this world right here my brother and sister is not my god my god is a righteous and a holy god an ever-present god and a god that says i'm going to bring you to such an anointing that you will take your own bible and you will judge yourself well i just don't like it when the pastor gets up and he preaches and i feel like he's judging me you know why you would feel that way i wanna i want you now i'm gonna kick satan in the teeth right now any time you would ever say that is because you haven't been judging yourself amen because if you judged yourself by the word and the pastor come and said you ought not be doing that you would say amen amen brother paul loves me he's not trying to make me feel bad he loves me and god's using him to remind me of what i've already looked in the word and judge myself and realize i need to change but you see satan's will is which one of my relatives was sitting up close here so i could go up and rub all over them and give you my version of the warm and fuzzy where he just pastor loves me so much told me even though i'm living in sin i'm going to make the rapture no the pastor ain't doing a very good job no and neither are you or else you'd be saying pastor that's not according to the word but you see the will the battle of the wills see the church would worship god of this evil age seeing that then seeing a little minority group isn't it funny we live in a time right now i wasn't going to preach on this but i just can't help myself have you ever noticed my brother and sister god's going to deal with a minority amen right he's calling out a minority he's bringing a people that are not done and what is the big fuss we have in the world right now what's it about minorities satan's trying to call attention to this little minority and lift it up and say oh see you're not doing it right and the whole time trying to draw attention from another minority that is standing there in the midst that the religious world says you know what if you guys had truth i won't tell you where to find this but it's out there as a resource people well we know this ministry of william branham while it was supernatural and many things happened we have seen now that it hasn't really amounted to much hallelujah well you can gold plate your piece of plastic all you want but god is producing a bride that is solid gold she has no flaw she has no air she has no contamination hallelujah so you look now you might say brother paul you really went out on a limb there but i'm telling you my brother and sister the times in the shadows we're calling attention to the minorities here because satan's trying to call attention away from this minority that is the bride of jesus christ in the hour so while chaos is uh flooding the world amen he's trying to draw it away to make people like you look like you're the oddball you're not into diversity you're not into acceptance you're not into equality what do all of those mean my brother and sister they're meaning what the devil defined them in this day he's the one giving the definition i know all of you are familiar with wikipedia do you ever look up definitions on wikipedia and you can almost name the generation of the person who wrote that definition because a lot of those definitions don't fit my generation and considering that brother david's sister diane brother bob you know uh of you might say another dispensational mark going back might even say the definition of my day doesn't quite fit the definition of their day and so you see what's happening it is slowly redefining the god of this evil asia is redefining the rights and the wrongs and the goods and the bads and and what's fair and what's equitable and all of these things redefining it all and i actually feel sorry for young people in this day because they go to a resource and the resource is not supporting god's word the foundation of our nation from days gone by the resource is supporting satan's definition of our day no wonder it'll be so close to see the very lick but my brother and sister it won't deceive the very elect the very dilect is not uh grounded in wikipedia and the spirit of the day the very left is grounded in the word of god and i am god and i change not so we can go back to that word and hang our soul on that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah where was i amen seeing that little minority gathered out from under the inspiration of god producing again the life of jesus christ amen that's what the minority is going to do not the majority the minority is going to produce the life producing again the life of jesus christ by the scripture that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in this bible foretells by prophecy what day we're living and what time we're living amen amen and what kind of events ought to be taking place now look at those events taking place my brother and sister the word shows us what's going to happen well i just saw in the news this and i saw on the news this and i saw in the news this and i just don't know what if they force us to all take a vaccine what if they do you know what you need vaccinated i'm here to tell you this morning every one of you ought to say lord vaccinate me this morning lord inject me with your word let it flow through my veins let every cell of my body respond to the vaccination of the holy ghost then i will be inoculated sealed in in this wicked age hallelujah but you see there again maybe brother paul's getting out on a limb forgive me if you think i am but my brother and sister there again we have another shadow another type of a people that are worried about being vaccinated in the flesh when they ought to be worried about what's going on in their soul this body is just this body it will come and it will go and i'm not being cavalier about that if we die we die in the flesh but we will not die in the spirit because death cannot come to a son or daughter of god but we are so oh my goodness i'm sorry to say this but we got churches split from fellowship of other churches because one church is saying i'm not getting vaccinated for nothing it's a mark of the beast and another one over there going we're supposed to comply with what they tell us well good they're here telling you give us your children are you going to comply let's find balance on that okay i maybe just gave you a slightly skewered view but the holy ghost will level the balance for you hallelujah amen you know we'll leave all that for another day what time we're living what kind of events ought to be taking place you see my brother and sister we're not looking for what's happening in washington dc or and new york at the u.n or what's happening at league of nations in brussels we're not looking to none of that matters i'm looking to another kingdom that's right amen i'm looking to one who says you know what i'm here now you can take this any way you please i'm just going to say it blind i'm here to exert my will on those who will believe amen in other words if you say you believe god's got a pathway for you amen we can't say we believe oh man does it says i believe and goes off on his own path but god's got a will for you and i it foretells exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see it we'll see it jesus said no man comes to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come and that's why i stand here this morning and tell you i believe you will come i believe you were called of god i believe even if you are sitting here right here this morning uninspired sitting here struggling with things in your life wondering if you should serve god or go out and serve the devil i believe you're here because god called you here i don't believe it's just an accident and if you're sitting here just waiting for the moment i'm 18 and i'm pushing the eject button well you just hang on because brother paul is over here and i'm not boasting on myself i'm telling you the truth i'm over here saying lord whatever you got to do i want to see our young people i want to see our families i want to see our old people in the word filled with the holy ghost and so i'll tell you we've got a battle of wills if you're ready to push an eject button i'm over here telling you lord strap them in with another seat belt throw another strap around them and cinch them down tight lord don't let them go hallelujah not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see will see it jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come i wish this was in highlight both i almost asked brother alex to highlight pull this it's the word joining hallelujah with the word hallelujah look at this this is not some man trying to push his will over on you the prophet of god says i never come to get you to follow me i come to introduce you to jesus christ the world says oh they're in a cult they follow a man they follow a man well my brother and sister i tell you what we won't even go there this morning but i'm telling you some of us are just cynical enough cryptic enough analytical enough that i'm not gonna follow a man i saw that as a teenager and i saw families explode and the pieces are still unpicked up i saw all this nonsense of people following a man but when god comes down in our myth and we see a living god coming in our midst my brother and sister follow it don't sit back and say i'm afraid i might be deceived if you're a son of god or daughter of god you can't be deceived god will give you supernatural vision he will give you understanding he will give you guidance is that not the scripture amen amen it's the word joining with the word and that word is in me can someone say amen this morning that word is in me hallelujah it's not external it's who i am [Music] it can't do nothing else we know it the day that we're living in oh look at that can't do nothing else this is the day we're living in oh hallelujah that's it amen can you see it yes it's not woe unto me no sir way too many people around this message are like woe unto me poor us the word in you amen cannot reject the word that's coming to you that's right scares me people say i've been following the message for x amount of time and i don't believe that's what the prophet of god meant i'm like a turtle lord just in case you're sending a hand grenade a mortar or a cannon shell i'll just you know why the sermon the unveiling of god brother brown makes statements and then just a few quotes later a few paragraphs later says and they'll say it ain't so and we've got people that say brother man was a prophet look at what he said and say it ain't soul what spirit is that yeah right where did that come from i don't want to be judgmental so i won't decide whether they're a sadducee or a pharisee i hope you catch what i mean amen amen why the prophecy of the word says that we are going to fulfill the word my brother and sister didn't leave it with brother branham he fulfilled the portion he was called to but i was called to abortion were you called to abortion i want to fulfill the portion i was called to i don't want to be looking back to brother branham do what god told him to do get brother around and do what he did did brother run dude did it bro debate this debate that he should have went here he suddenly said no no no hold on oh what about you what about you are you doing what god called you to do or is the battle of the wills too big a battle for you and i and we're going to just go to church and we're going to go home and we're going to live life you see when you're a preacher there's certain things that raise your hackles yes sir can i be human the brothers were human brother trevor you don't mind if i just give a blip on you sweet brothers just like you sisters are sitting there sharing a little bit brother trevor's talking about a little experience at a restaurant and he's like come on you can say amen to that there's little things that cause your hackles to stand up and you're right and if we were just honest with each other we'd be saying that happens more often than should well maybe not to some of you but people like you so what happens god's coming down he's moving he's stirring hearts he's letting you be what you don't want to be isn't that amazing we got the idea that god's just going to whip us into shape and we're going to be this perfect little marching whatever but you see it's a great battle it's a great battle and that's why god don't feel bad saints but don't allow yourself to go on with this great feeling of euphoria oh god wants me to be like this oh god wanted me to be like that no sir what god's doing is allowing you to be that way so that then you can go away and the holy spirit move upon you and then you almost feel physically sick amen oh lord amen why did i do that why did i say that oh lord and the next time you feel like doing that you can then say i'm overcome i'll never do that again ever my wife and my children and the pastor and they're all exempt from this but i will never do that again no sir you see the battle of the wills the battle is constantly going on hallelujah how many of you can pet your black dogs you spend way too much time with him if you can pet him come on yeah we're not here to pet the black dog we're in a line up with the word of god amen so the words prophesied that in the bible we are going to fulfill the word of god amen to fulfill oh righteousness and can i make this boldly after saying what i've said we are amen we are saints fulfilling all righteousness it is not just a figure of speech it's not something we throw out it's not a cliche you are actually fulfilling all righteousness because god is changing you and i he is bringing us into his very image he's molding us now i for the sake of time my word is time go but going back to our scripture my brother and sister uh paul's speaking to timothy he didn't beat around the bush there's all these vessels and it's what you do whether you'll be a vessel of honor or dishonor oh well if i'm predestinated god's going to wash me and make me a vessel of honor well good when the preacher now i don't want you to feel ill for me so i'm going to use brother david for an example when the preacher comes out in the church and grabs you by the nap of your neck and drags you up to the pulpit to the platform and says repent get that out of your life well wait you're offended just a second you're all offended but weren't you the same ones that said if god wants out of my life he'll take it out [Music] come on you can't have it both ways you can sit there with your arms crossed in that stubborn spirit and say well if god wants my temper to go away if god wants this that god wants that well maybe god will come to the day i praise you thank you lord for letting brother david be the example it's going to be god anointed grabbing you dragging you up and you're going to be like i'm leaving this church i'm done with this church he's humiliated me well isn't that what you asked for wouldn't it be easier just simply to say lord but thy will be done lord soften me wash me cleanse me yes lord i don't want i don't want to be anything but what your word says i am amen amen we know the day we're living in isn't that beautiful okay now we're at the quarter point of our sermon today let's move forward praise the lord it's a day of celebration right now saints i have to admit this i'll have to hurry through this because there's just so much and as i was studying this really come alive to me now why does he stand by the reason is romans 8 17 18 and if the children then heirs heirs of god join heirs with christ it be so we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer the ring this is the reason the the reason for this is that character is simply never made without suffering amen now i want to ask you this morning how many of you want character amen come on every hand in this building ought to be up every one of us ought to be saying lord give me patience give me character don't sit there and try and back out of that like well i know the lord will do it anyway you might as well stand up and volunteer amen amen reminds me of a story about a young man in the army they have this detail you ten go over here get shovels you guys go over here get garbage cans you guys go over there and do this and this guy he just kept slinking kind of back through the crowd pretty soon the sergeant says who wants to drive a truck yes go get that wheelbarrow well god's going to get you to volunteer one way or another you think praise the lord i just want to be blessed i want to be the one in church standing on the pew sing it hallelujah i'll move on recent vast characters simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic and i'm on to just throw this out to you look at our government yes sir you will see the exact manifestation of this right here in our government amen reminds me i won't name the court the deal but some of the financial stuff that i like to read and follow there was a ceo did some things he shouldn't have done and they ousted him and when it was all said and done from ousting him he was going to sue them pursue suing them and the reason was is they had shortchanged him they only gave him 125 million dollars to leave and it should have been 200. see what kind of characters taking over our world i can't live on 125 million dollars well i probably couldn't either i mean you think about that i mean yeah in fact i kind of get depressed thinking about that but power with character is fit to rule and since he oh i hope you see i hope this means as much to you as it means to me and since he wants i'm sorry i i read this quote just and i can't get this out of it and since he wants paul to share even his throne amen can you put your name in there since he wants us amen put your name in there amen since he wants us to share even his throne and the same basis that he overcome and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and when i read it that way there's something inside of me says overcome paul press to the mark keep going paul repent if you've got to repent praise when you should pray stand on the word of god amen amen or do we see ourselves like we mostly are in normal life and we're one little blip in the masses of humanity well i wouldn't have been born where i was born if god really and i wouldn't have this thorn in my flesh if god i wouldn't suffer from this and i wouldn't that i wouldn't have to count my pennies if god loves me thank you lord will shut up and move on amen i i'm just having a hard time with an inner voice this morning hey man i hope you don't mind i'm fighting it and a little temporary suffering that's it i wasn't able to buy a new pickup everybody's buying a new house and i kept my house they got new clothes i saw that dress and i saw that suit [Music] excuse me i'm telling the inner voice is just really hard on me this morning the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation who wants to enter in amen come on saints i'm not going to take the easy way remember when our kids look at our kids they're no longer kids anymore they're so grown up but remember you know when they put on the play for us you know what struck me i set right out there what struck me the shortcut of that whole little play what i remember so much was the shortcut i think any time you come to something that has a sign that says shortcut pass it by yeah yeah want to go in a rapture sign here oh okay must be a short guy that's strange or a treasure is laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you this is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials can someone say amen we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that the church that is oh grace hang on i almost censored this out i almost had him just put a little line through this the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it amen okay moment of truth this morning how many has got it amen you know what you're saying yes sir lord i'm okay with fiery trials i'm okay lord with tribulations i'm okay lord with struggles in my life i'm okay with the hard days lord i'm okay when i like the sun to shine but it's raining and i need it to rain and the sun is shining and i'm okay with all of that lord what i care about is much greater amen much greater than that not but one goes through that the church that's not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 8 from whom the lord loveth he chastens us and scourges every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement where of all your partakers then you're bastards and not sons wow that's pretty strong language isn't it amen that's quite a quote i hope you are we all good are we all good now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age amen there's no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god so look we're back now to this great battle between the wills oh hallelujah i hope you don't mind we'll be a few minutes long this morning because i have to finish this all the rest of this is not wasted but well anyway it's needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffering long and is grouchy kind see that's why god moved no brother trevor under a bus that's why the lord checked trevor when he was a little grouchy with that clerk in there amen amen not be ashamed of saints no this is god moving it says hmm no love suffereth long and is kind matthew 5 11 12 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say o manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you cloudy skies and storms of life are no science god's disappearance amen come on saints neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved amen amen now look at this the world we live in today one of their things my brother and sister is they take john 3 16 and apply it in a carnal fashion and they say oh god loves everybody what brother brown says here is in no way conflict with john 3 16. no sir his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen i don't care what the troubles are of your life right now you can stand up and say god loves me amen i i it seems like everything i've done have any of you no you don't have to raise your hands but have any of you ever done something questionable yes go ahead raise your hands and then things didn't work so well and satan come and anointed you god's punishing me for what i did over here i know many are fine folks many a fine christian and they're like oh god's punishing me i i don't i don't think you got the right revelation on that man amen you know it's strange i hope this makes sense to you it's strange world we live in when i was a kid if you walked in a store and ate a banana they'd slap your hide off the floor and drag you out now they walk in the store they eat the banana and they say oh i'll pay for it at the checkout counter and now the very present is they walk in the store they eat the banana and drop the peel on the floor you see how times are changing and the time should be changing for the bride of christ that we are no longer looking at it as oh god loves me loves me not he said he loves us and it should never even be a question that enters our mind he loves us hallelujah amen by believing how we prove his love by believing what he said by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that are in wisdom allow us to come to pass i know thy poverty because thou art rich there it is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he's the head of his household he is the provider i want to know how many of come on lift a hand if you will if you've got courage how many of you trust god so much today that you would lift a hand and say he's my provider he's my husband i am not going to try to make it happen i'm going to let my provider my husband you see if we're not in that position we're still trying to do we're striving for ourselves that's exactly right amen he's the head of his household he's a provider is a protector yet he looks on at their poverty oh how can this be oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can god bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just give in and lavish everything material on them oh hallelujah brother isaac one time shared with me a deal this preacher i don't remember the whole story he's there in the church and he's preaching some kind of prosperity gospel and he's there in the church he's got all the people raising their hands and the preachers raising his hands and money started to fall and then right behind that it reminds them all the more you give the more god will get you oh my that's pretty clever hallelujah brother i haven't come past the offering plate but you see a real believer sees through that amen no this god doesn't need our money so look at that come on i hope this dispels any of you have any issue with this how can god bear to look upon his own in a time of need not just stop it all i know i told you sweetheart parenting class here again sorry parents i know i told you honey you do it again i'm gonna whip you but instead i tell you what you do if you'll just go pick up two toys in your wreck of a room then i'll give you some ice cream i don't want to see you suffer i'm going to stop all this going on i'm going to stop your character building and i'm just going to give it all to you sorry that's not my god no that's right if you're a real believer it's not your god amen he wants you to have character because he knows that you will reign with power one day and anything short of having character he's already declared as satanic amen are we good can i go on just a few short more minutes here is where you have to believe again in the love and the goodness and the wisdom of god this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for the moral right oh now y'all can just sit back and be quiet because this is to brother paul take no thought for tomorrow what you shall eat or what you shall put on your father knoweth the things you have need of i i i see the word need in there but it's not in the context that normally we're like lord i need this unless of course you were praying for patience he who closed the lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you do we believe god sent a prophet do we believe these words are just haphazard just something to fill up time and space he'll do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consists is not of the things he possesses but rather seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness oh look what the prophet of god says right here and all material necessities will be added unto you remember there's no i want in there amen the people of god are not material-minded oh can i be humble enough to stand before you and say it's something i fight against absolutely or should i act super spiritual and talk like it's all just your problem no sir there's times you look at things i'll tell you how silly this can get i was searching on a website those of you who buy things would be familiar with z idaho there was a pistol on there i drove all the way to cuna to say 40 bucks in a gas hog because i didn't have to pay sales tax but i wanted that pistol but i didn't want to pay sales tax so therefore i'll drive all the way to cuna i'll just it made perfect sense and i thought it did until this moment i just preached on it a pistol i've never shot oh my we won't go there they're not material minded they're christ's might that's right amen they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of christians are not wealthy and i say thank you lord amen amen rather they are on the poor side it was so in jesus day was true in paul's day and it should be true today my you know there's people that claim on the internet you'll find this if you search far enough for it don't waste your time that believe brother branham laid the seed for the prosperity gospel well he did to the bride and the bride gets up every day wakes up in the morning and says i am rich amen i am rich every day that i live i am rich okay let's go on the quote and i'll prove that to you and it is not too true today for the latest church is one of vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods my how rich the church is in goods but how poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is meat and drink it is not material it is within us hallelujah a rich man here's my quote to prove my point hallelujah a rich man i'm rich this morning i am wealthy beyond any measure there is on the face of the earth hallelujah oh hallelujah amen a rich man is rich in god not in worldly things oh christ the spirit i see your poverty i see your need you haven't very much if anything to boast of what you did have has been taken from you you gladly gave up your possession in exchange for eternal ones you're laughed at you're scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of it all your security now can i just speak god to you amen you might own a little ground you might own a little business that produces something you might have money in the bank but i can assure you if that becomes your security blanket then god will take your blanket from you amen amen that's right oh how to do it moms you know what i'm talking about some of you had children that sucked their thumb i'm not speaking ill of that why did they do that somewhere along the line have become a security to them of comfort some children had a blanket yes sir now mom now i know this comes across course forgive me but mom won't you be ashamed when your child is going off to college still sucking their thumb and dragging a blanket now that's hard i'm not speaking ill of that because we as humans we all have we all have little things as a childhood i'm not going to reveal mine so don't ask but you see god says no no no no no i i don't have any children i don't have a bride i don't have a a people that i've called that have some other form of security so what do you do if you're in a irresponsibly attached to something on this earth don't be shocked when god takes it from you that's right he's doing it because he loves you he's doing it because you've got to be broken from this security and completely be dependent upon him [Music] amen but you are rich in spite of it all your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great reward your kingdom is yet to come but it will come it will be an everlasting one yes i'm mindful of your trials and woes and i know how hard it is to get along but i will remember all this when i return to claim you as my own then i will reward you now this is nothing against rich people because god can save a rich man some of god's children are rich but money can be such a snail now look at this i won't go back to it but remember our opening scripture to come we have to we have to take me back brothers to the very our opening scriptures i'm sorry saints amen hallelujah now look at this and meek instructing those that oppose themselves have you ever found yourself making a decision you don't ain't the right one you did it anyway that's what the devil usually does amen gets us to i shouldn't do this we do it if god prevention will give them repentance acknowledging them truth that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will we're talking about the devil just deciding i'm going to come down and i'm going to tie you up i'm going to wrap you up i'm going to put you and bind you i'm going to take you in this snare and my will now saints think about this you say well we're believers we're message believers this won't happen to you it does come on somebody have the courage to say amen it does you know you could let something just go away or be an offense and we choose to make an offense you can let something that is done and it'll be in such a way or stand up i recently bought an object and the man's filling out the bill of sale and he says just tell me what number you want wrote in here you don't have to pay sales tax you know what the devil does comes right in there right in that moment and anoints you yeah i mean if he put half the money on there they wouldn't know the difference i'll just pay a few dollars in sales tax oh but the holy ghost comes along and says i took you out of that snare once that's right i delivered you from that don't go back see but the devil is going to be right there to offer it right there to alfred oh sorry i'm getting all drawn out this morning i told myself don't do it paul don't do it paul just preach real fast and furious and be done hallelujah let's go back to where we was brother amen some of god's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only to those who now some of you are probably thinking i know some of you read ahead on these quotes and i just wish you would yes the rich man's going to have problems but did you know if we sit here come on let me just paint a little scenario you just got your paycheck you just paid the mortgage or the rent you paid your car payment you bought groceries and there's oh my goodness not much left over lord if i i just won that 456 million in that lottery of course lord i would pay tithes i'd build a whole brand new church i'd make the church give brother paul a paycheck and i would buy that mansion and i would buy that car and i would buy these clothes and this boat and that fishing pole and that gun i would do this and i would do that probably a reason you don't have 453 million dollars because it would become a snare and the more you have the more time you have to devote and satan would be going now see this is opposite contrary to him and thinking satan would be like i got their soul i bought 10 000 worlds for only 453 million now think about it in a business sense that's a bargain that's a bargain but money can be a snare only not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it way back in their first age jade cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons the poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in god that's right you know i'm just going to throw this out this has happened on every continent amen you'll see people receive help from churches from ministries and then as god blesses it and their little group is there instead of trusting they just have been trained now walk around with their hand brothers we want this brothers we need this brothers can you this brothers can you do that come on saints you know why grace tabernacle has a gift of god right here in this building is because those who labored through the years cried out to god and said lord that's right that be your will father we'd like to have a church of our own not to have to move from pillar to post like we did for years it was not my brother and sister a handout except from the lord see we didn't go i've never revealed this to you we've had people that come and said hey we can raise money for you to build a church some of you that were been through with us through the years here you'd be saying what brother paul you didn't no no my brother sister i never felt like god would bless us with the church because somebody down here somebody over there somebody over piled a bunch of cash up and gave it to us you know why we can value what we have here because god gave it to us not another man not no string no nothing just god amen the poor trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting god don't do it says james don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer and today it's not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had yet less being accomplished spiritually oh my goodness it's not with money that god works he moves by spirit with the moving of the spirit comes only to a life amen consecrated to the word amen amen who wants to be rich this morning amen hallelujah i want so much of jesus christ in my life i want so much of the power of god in our mid saints that we can literally walk around saying i'm rich beyond measure hallelujah now look i i got to hurry i got to hurry my oh my psalms 124 when i read this my heart just soars i hope your source after we've read this stop reading song of degrees of david if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their tea our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare oh can someone say hallelujah this morning the snare is broken we are no longer here as a bride of christ walking in this life looking for a snare looking for a snare because the holy ghost said i'll lead you you think god's going to lead you into something against his word he's not going to leave you there he's not going to guide you where you are going to fall and never get up he's going to lead you into all righteousness oh hallelujah this snare is broken and paul has escaped hallelujah we're no longer sitting here with a fear that we will be taken in the snare of laodicea oh our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth there's where it all lies my brother and sister oh can you say thank you lord we have been delivered from this air amen oh hallelujah there's all kinds of snares in this world can you see this can you see this satan's business amen it's got a billboard out in front of his business custom-made snares built just for you does he not what your problem is not my problem well my problem is not your problem so we have to face one but i stand on the word of god that we have read i have saw the snare amen broken amen amen god has come in an age when the prophet of god says that denominational spirit comes in and pulls the very life out of the people amen the snare that's right it's broken amen i'm closing i'm closing amen huh you know what can can you guys just humor me this morning anybody well in the human road paul this morning hallelujah would you just say with me the snare is broken the snare is broken hallelujah let that be your testimony this morning the snare is broken hallelujah now proverbs 29 25 as we just i'm hurrying to finish here sister emmy would you come brother sean the fear of man bringeth a snail but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be saved so don't let satan put some kind of fear in you amen that fear in itself will become a snare i'm afraid i'm afraid my children are going to backslide and just go out the world i i what am i do i tell you what you do put the blood over the doorpost live a consecrated life invite the holy spirit to live in your house with you stand with confidence put your petition between before the lord lord you gave them to me and i've committed them to you lord i have confidence in the keeping power of the word hallelujah don't let don't let that snare amen that fear come upon you amen amen we're close right here cast not away therefore your confidence you know every time that we doubt that god's going to do this work for us we're casting our confidence away well i i picked up my child's walkman or well that's old-fashioned you guys young people know what a walkman is those still exist you know you open them up put the cassette tape in do you know what a cassette tape is [Music] i can only imagine what my mother must have felt like when i was a kid find the things the music all of these kind of things what's happening to my children you got a choice to struggle up and die at the fear of losing your children you've got the choice to stand up and say lord i've committed them to you i've dedicated them to you and i stand on your word you are in control amen amen hallelujah can i tell you will you cry bitter tears you will cry bitter tears i've cried many a bitter deer but along the way god said got a choice boy now i've i've i put this out to even grown men that i do business with things malfunction not always our problem sometimes it's others but enough times it's our own problem had a man one day say uh paul you just had a chopper blew up that was a lot of money just flew out the window it was throwing chunks of metal out bing bing bing and i'm like got out of the chopper this man climbs out of his truck and he goes paul why are you laughing what's wrong with you i said well let's either laugh or cry and i don't feel like crying so praise the lord i'll just wave goodbye to that ten thousand dollars and they think you're crazy but i want to take it away from that don't be thinking about that subcarnal sign the devil comes in and he tries to trip everything up you got a choice not really laugh or cry you got a choice between crying or praising that's it [Music] in the morning when i rise just give me jesus that's all i want i don't need anything else i don't need a bailout i don't need a handout i don't need somebody's sympathy i need jesus i need him cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for you have need of patience hallelujah yes
