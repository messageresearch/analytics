his word it's a [Music] reation finally had to have a little Fellowship today it's been quite a while and U he gets to the end of it and said you are preaching tonight right so here we are and uh appreciate the the open door God bless you for that and each one of you that came out tonight we love you and and I hope you can hear me until he gets back with the battery operator we uh it's just never amazes me that song that you're just saying actually there's parts of that that go along very much with what I'm feeling the Lord would like to bring tonight and uh how that God can take the simplest things sometimes and things that we don't even realize or think about and turn that into something that's So Glorious and yet sometimes it seems so small and yet that's literally the the mystery of God revealed I was thinking here recently in Reading in uh Ephesians thank you reading in Ephesians where uh it said that the Mysteries would be uh revealed by by way of the Apostles and Prophets and such and we think a lot of times in this day and age because of the tremendous amount of Revelation that has been sent to us we tend to think of it as big things and high things but to me one of the greatest Revelations that I've seen from the pro prophet's message is those two little dots those little colons because just understanding the concept that anytime you see that little colon there's some there's a stop and a time frame it might be 10 seconds it might be 2,000 years but the fact that it's a stop and a time frame what a mystery to me that's what a tremendous M CU I talk to other people and other ministers from different Realms and such and when I mention things like that to them they're just astounded they just go what I was talking to a a woman recently that kind of given her a testimony thing and I mentioned a couple of scriptures I I said well there's a break there and that break gives you okay this is how the scripture starts but then this is how manifests and then this is how it fulfills and she was just there's what what a what a mystery and yet it's two little dots but what a tremendous to us as Believers to realize that then you go back and you start reading your scriptures brother brandham said after the seals it's a new book well it really is when you start understanding that oh that's not just all one conglomeration no it's in three pieces of how God brings it and then how he manifests it and so I I love the Lord and I appreciate what he's done and and what he's doing even right now and uh let's just go ahead let's stand for a moment as we uh read from his word and let's approach the author here for just a moment gracious Heavenly Father it is indeed a privilege to be here tonight and to realize that Lord this is the time this is the age this is the people Lord in which sin is blotted out in other words it never exists anymore in the presence of God and so we thank you for that tonight and realizing that position in US of you in US is what brings that to pass Lord and our hearts and lives and anoint your words tonight father that people might become as brother venam re revealed to us the ABCs always believe Christ and again always becoming Christ as we give you the service we thank you and Praise You In jesus' name amen we'll read first uh from acts the 7th chapter and uh I realized there is a very good message that was preached called you know what house will you build me and this is not to add to or detract from that in in anyway but just to take another look at building a little bit and that's what this uh scripture refers to we'll start with uh first 48 acts 7 and verse 48 said how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saeth the prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things and then uh in Luke the 17th chapter as we turn to here it's 17 and verse 20 and this is uh and when he was demanded of this of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or low there for behold the kingdom of of God is within you and then one last place from Luke and that's Luke 12 and verse 31 and 32 uh make sure I got the right place here for all these things do Nations the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you uh that's not the it's right after that oh it's in verse 32 I'm sorry fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom gracious Heavenly Father we thank you add your blessing we pray to your word in Jesus Christ's name amen be seated please and you know I you know that I've often I think I've done it here a couple times talked about moving things around in a lot of these words and how that God is always moving and always hiding himself in Simplicity and and how that you know to we can move this it becomes uh transitive which simply means to move from one place to another and we've talked about that and you can see it and and and what it's moving in this case is water inside of a vessel and and we take it and we thank you for the water and we just moved a portion of this water that's in the vessel into my body you could say well where did it go well it's part of me and I'm part of it but there's another part that's totally unseen we can't see it we you know I mean you can taste the water itself you can feel the water yourself it's you know it's kind of cold in the bottle and and all those different things but the Unseen thing that's really the most important part of the whole as it were demonstration is the fact that in that water is life as human beings we have to have water to be alive in fact I can't remember what percentage it is but it's a very large percentage of these bodies are actually water now that little portion I just drank is now part of this body but it's not just the water that water provides life and the word of God is that way even as the water in fact Jesus uh said to the woman of the well you know if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink and you'd never thirst again and she said I want that water well we understand that the word of God is like water in that it provides life to the believer we can't always see it directly and yet we do as we see the manifestation that it brings into our lives when uh you know at in my younger days rock and roll bumed so to speak and uh dabbled with some of the many of other things of the world that go along with that rock and roll scene and stuff but when Jesus Jesus Christ came into me it didn't show right away right I was still playing in a rock band for a few weeks after that maybe a month I don't remember exactly how long it was my hair was you know about to about where the beard is now and the other thing all those other things that go with it and yet when I surrendered my heart to Christ all I knew was he came and when people would ask me because I'd tell them I'm Different something's different about me and I remember even when I asked the Lord when I got up after committing my life to Christ and waking up you know wet with the tears and stuff and I looked at my body and I I said man I'm looking at it going what happened I'm not even the same person and there was a still Small Voice said born again now and yet it didn't manifest fully right away but something happened the life of Jesus Christ came into me and when you we surrender ourselves personally to him well just surrender Lord Jesus he said whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved he doesn't say you're all they're all bride he doesn't say there he just said they shall be saved that's his word and there is a life behind that word that we call eternal life now whatever manifestation it takes or how it some people have given their hearts to Christ and they're in the grave tonight and you say well that doesn't look very Lively but the fact that there there is a life in the word that was transmitted into them if they ever one time surrendered their their life to Jesus Christ no matter how backslid they got or whatever circumstances came if there was a full surrender just Jesus Christ take me it was enough to get the thief of the Cross there the the one the one Thief he said Lord remember me that's all he said and he but it was the right words the right time for him because we know that we were in his thoughts before the world began according to the book of Ephesians and being in those thoughts when that man said remember me he was actually reaching out into [Music] eternity and causing Jesus as it were to look into eternity and see that man was meant to be there that's a life behind the word the man's life was in pitiful condition pitiful and he even he even admitted it he said I deserve this but you don't right and the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ was that his form of repentance just I deserve this but you don't by recognizing that that sacrifice and he called him Lord and when he did that the life that was being manifested in that sacrifice suddenly moved from that sacrifice through words through the words of that sacrifice Into the Heart of that man and you know we've heard the story of when he gets to Heaven you know all these other people may be giving their testimonies and they're saying who are you and how did you get here and he goes I don't know I was just just hanging there and here I am and that was his testimony he just recognized God but the life behind behind the word and so we read that scripture there in in Acts and he says what house will you build me and how that he said I created all of it you know how let's go back and read it and as we think about building a house and it it struck me today in our conversation brother Paul about how that you know we look at different kinds of preaching and we look at church splits and all the stuff that happens with people and how people some people go this way and some people will go that way and uh there's divisions there's troubles and of course the we hear from the word of God it says there shouldn't this shouldn't be named among you that there's divisions and those kind of things and yet sometimes there has to be and that's maybe part of the Paradox because uh there was division with you know Paul and Silas and there was division with uh some of the other disciples when even when Peter went down to the Gentiles when he went back all the Jews were really getting on Peter's case and he makes special emphasis look the Lord told me to do this I had a vision I you know he's really having to defend his position for doing that but it was the life of God that sent him there because now it's going to manifest in a new form to Gentiles who you know brother brandom said we're just packing a club on our back we weren't really even looking for the Messiah and yet the life behind the word had to be manifested I was uh listening I want to say it was to uh God's provided place of worship one of them I know he preached it more than once but uh in that tape uh there's a Doctrine out there in the message that they uh I call it kind kind of a tunist because they say that Jesus Christ can't be God because he died and God can't die but you know I listen to that uh particular message and he said that God hid himself in Death from the Jews and we know that he went to hell and preached to the Sinners so he was very much alive while he was there but he was hiding from the Jews why was he hiding from the Jews because we had to come in so he hid himself behind that sealed tomb so that he could manifest himself for you and I so his death was life because that life was being transmitted from as it were the bottle to fulfill the life of God concerning Jesus Christ so this thing that we call Salvation is about life and it's about the life that we live and I make tons of mistakes and sometimes I even feel like banging my head against the wall and say why why did I do that why am I doing this and yet then sometimes God can turn it completely around and I go wow that's what that was all about and it's because God is trying to manifest or to show a form of life and so we see that he said what house are are me have these fancy I went to the eye doctor today he said wow you're still way ahead of every everybody else with those new little lenses in there but this has you know to make the little letters bigger in the bottom here so he said uh in 7 and 48 but the question came up there uh how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet so the prophet who is a mouthpiece of God has just made a statement that uh he dwelleth not in temples made with hands and that was a prophetic word and behind that word there is a life to be manifested well we know that Solomon in fact in verse 47 it says Solomon built him a temple or built him a house then he says Heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or what place is the place of my rest and you see those little dots just scattered through there and how we begin to as we look at that he says what house will you be you know the Lord says what house will you build me and then there's a stop or rest and then he said what is the place of my rest so there's a break in the building of the house and when the rest enters that house even as it was with you know David did a lot of things to prepare the building of the temple but he was not allowed to lay his hands on it not even once because you know God said David you're a bloody man and I J just can't do it it has to be a temple of peace and so it all fell back onto Solomon his son to provide as it were the Working Hands to build that Temple and how that the life of God was moving through the words because God had told David you know the fact that you wanted to do this for me I didn't never ask for it but the fact that you even wanted to do this for me is uh you know it's a great thing and he said but you can't do it but your son can and remember behind all of those words there is a life that's going to manifest some portion of God and as we think that uh David representing the as it were the kingship of God in his life because when it started there with Samuel uh the word of the Lord God's word the life behind the word that comes out and goes to Samuel that word comes to that Prophet who becomes the mouthpiece and God says go anoint me a king and as we begin to view the life of David over and over and over we see the actions uh being produced in the life of David that point us directly to Jesus Christ as our King he's a Shepherd who's our Shepherd Jesus Christ he slew the giant who slays our Giants Jesus Christ he cut the head off the giant what was the prophecy concerning Judah your hand will be in the neck of the enemies go who who cuts the head off the enemy for us right Jesus Christ yes and see so the life of God came and began to build us a picture of as God being King and it comes all the way to the end and yet he said but David you can't build the house your son has has to do it God himself as king could not build the house but his son Jesus Christ builds the house and his son and again I use this scripture a lot because it's meant so much to me Genesis 49 when it says you know he's the he's the 49 and N I think it is or eight and it said that he's he's the prey the prey that goes up and then then the next portion of that scripture is he's the rest rest and then after the rest he said who will Rouse him up or who will bring him on the scene and so the sun builds the temple Jesus Christ came as the temple of God in Shepherd form just like David when the anointing came on him he was already a Shepherd but now he was I'll say a special Shepherd because he had the life of God now protruding from that Shepherd's position and with that in mind and and all down through there he keeps showing the life of God the life of God but that life of God that kingship of God could not pro provide the temple for him to live in it took his son for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and the son builds the house now we talk about a house and we think often times even you know considering that this is called a house of the Lord well somebody had to lay a foundation and and after the foundation they got all the plans out and they did all the stuff for the flooring and the and all the parts to this position but even as a church house even as a house of the Lord without life being in it it's pointless right you are the life of God that was manifested to be in this building tonight thank you Lord the fact that the building's here it's wonderful you he have done a fantastic job in my estimate every time I come here I just stand amazed and think man how did they do this and but it's because there was life here there were people that were manifesting what the word of God says to do get a place to worship get a place where and it's not the place the place is the Life of Christ that's in you and how that without that it's vain worship and that's why as ministers it's we must stay with the word we must stay with the life of God manifesting through us and in us to other people this eternal thing we call eternal life it's not just about me it's not just about you there's a purpose to it and that purpose I wanted to uh let's read Psalms 51 maybe it's a little more like teaching tonight I don't know exactly and I know you're familiar with this because we sing this as a song and it's uh the the song You Know created me a clean heart oh God and we I I sung this song many times in fact we go sometimes on the mission fields and and there'll be a certain song that for whatever reason God picks that song as like a theme sometime for a whole trip and one time when we went to Nicaragua without anybody saying anything about it this particular song created me a clean heart and and renew a right spirit in me almost everywhere we went without saying anything about it they sang this song almost every church I can't do that I didn't even ask it I just about the fourth or fifth place we went to I went that's pretty amazing because then you begin to rec recognize it's the spirit of God moving and it's moving on those people but there's a purpose when we sing this song and when we ask this as as a as a blessing to us or as a uh prayer request I often tell people sing this as a prayer sing this is in communion or in communication with the Jesus Christ or The God that's in you we read from Luke the kingdom of God is where it's within you he said it doesn't come by observation you observed me drink the W drink from this bottle but what you couldn't observe is the life that it's manifesting in this body it's unobservable and so it is with the word of God it's unobservable to the outside five senses and even the things of the spirit but it manifests by what it provides to other people he says uh create in me a clean heart oh God renew a right spirit in me and uh Within Me cast me not away from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and hold me with thy free spirit now that's all wonderful those are blessings for us those are parts of the request that's we're asking for the life of God the presence of God to be here to be here we're asking for those things and we're asking uh when we sing this create in me a clean heart we're asking for all the pieces to the building and believing that because it's the word of God every word of God has potential of creation and as these become creative words and when we pray this prayer uh I just heard brother bham saying again again recently that God loves to hear his word spoken back to him right so when we sing this we are singing the life of God back to God yes and when we uh sing it back to him uh deep calleth to the Deep with the noise of thy wat spouts and when that life of God has come to us and begins to reverberate back back to God then we begin to see things happen I begin to see things in my life I begin to see things how be it ever so small sometimes but it can be something that I call it lifechanging I suppose but here he gives us what the reason for this song is really or this these words is about and it is a Psalm and he said uh and it pulled me with with thy free spirit and in verse 13 it says then will I teach transgressors thy ways what's the point if you're just doing it for self- edification there's no point right the point between the life that was transmitted through the psalmist David into us that we sing back to him the point of it is to teach transgressors the way and that doesn't have to take a three-hour teaching message it can be just the simplest thing that you say or do I remember one time I was going through a terrible trial it seemed like and a sister who hadn't seen us for a while and she just came up and grabbed my hand and says God bless you David had a great big smile on her face and it just it's like the trial just went you don't have to be be a preacher you don't have to be uh you know a three-hour message or whatever it is just show The Life of Christ let that life live in us then will you teach transgressors the way and sinners will be converted to thee and there's those dots again and you go wow Sinners will be converted well without going into you know deep thoughts about this if you want to read again about a conversion it's in Acts 3:19 we'll go ahead and read it because it gives a particular time frame of conversion and that's you know we read there in the about the house and he said where is the rest going to be and then here in three and I believe it's 19 he two won work you love him amen when he's giving the uh Peter's given the dissertation here and he says repent therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and there he gives a specific time frame when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Jesus Christ which was before preached unto you now at the time that he saying this Jesus Christ as we think of it had not been preached to them there these scribes and Pharisees here and this is you know just after uh the day of Pentecost and stuff within a certain time frame there and he's saying that you know that Jesus Jesus Christ was preached to you and there are probably some of them sitting there thinking what are you talking about we never even heard the name of Jesus Christ but there's another scripture and I forgot to write it write it down for you but it says it's in First Peter and it said what that the time that the prophets would realize that the things that they said back there were pointing to Jesus Christ even though they didn't know it do you think Isaiah necessarily knew what he was Tau maybe he saw it in a vision and was relating the vision when he said you know he'll be wounded for our transgressions and with our Stripes we'll you know we're healed and stuff and maybe he had some understanding of that but he didn't know when it was going to happen right and he didn't know who it was going to happen to but the life had to speak it because it's going to move those words the creative power of God was going to come into those words and when it goes into those comes out from that mouth the prophets are the mouthpiece of God and when it comes out from that prophet's mouth it begins to go into eternity and form all of the necessary ingredients to bring that to pass do you understand once it was spoken the life of God went behind it and began to put certain people in certain Bloodlines and certain people doing this and they had the and they went into captivity and all those different things all of that had to do with well after they went down and they came back and we I forget if it's Ezra or Nehemiah one of those and their tribes are all mixed up everything's a mess and because now it's going to take a savior to save them they can't cannot even possibly do it by the law because everything's mixed up think about the message marriage and divorce brother benam said stay as you are it's too messed up there's no way you can go back and change it just don't do it again yeah but it takes the power of a savior and it now it comes up and all that was the power of God or the life of God setting the stage so that when Jesus Christ came on the scene and he could see himself in that position even Jesus Christ the man it says he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he didn't just have an easy life and everything was hey Grand no he suffered certain things even in his natural life before he even went to Calvary Calvary was an obedience to the things that he had learned by the things that he suffered and he learned obedience even and when he spoke certain things it was the life of God manifesting in him that he could turn around and find himself identify himself in the scriptures with the life of God Amen when he saw and it you know it came there and said the scribes and Pharisees demanded of him when is the kingdom he didn't answer when it was he told them where it was right he said the kingdom of God is within you and it comes without observation you can't even see because it's a life it's a life that is manifested or imparted to us through the life of God through the building of the Temple of the son not God and his great Jehovah over us as the kingship but the temple was built by the Sun but even when the temple was finished what had to happen it wasn't until the sun turns and he says he built a scaffold and he gets on the scaffold and begins to pray and implore for God to in in part of the prayer he said you know if any man even look towards this Temple God hear their prayer and so as Solomon is doing this and you know that said the the the power of God came down so strong in a cloud it said the other ministers they couldn't even minister they said it was too much God came down the presence of God came down to fill the temple it was completed according to plans but it still took the life of God to fulfill it and we know that for the most part I suppose you know there's different problems in the me what we call the message of the hour you know this church had this split and this one did this and these guys went that way and people ask me well why is that and what and well it's the life of God and each part of the the body has a different function that it does my fingers you know you see me play the piano here but not the guitar much anymore because these fingers can't do it after years of running chainsaws it's up here but it's not down here and it's kind of the same way with God we God is building a temple the life of God came into us at the beginning of our Salvation I'll call it salvation experience and that experience begins to manifest itself and we think uh about the building of the temple and how that you know they put all the all the pieces together and they built that Temple but uh when you go back to the original one that was in the the tent and stuff the way that one was built they started by building the inside first because they had to make the garments and they had to uh make the eum and Thum and they had to to do all those things and the second temple was built from the outside and then it was filled inside and I remember I believe it was that brother gishan Solomon a few years back uh when he talked about you know cuz people ask well how are the Jews ever going to build a temple and he said we're already building it and when he said we're building it from the inside they already have all the stuff to put in it when the Temple's put together together they've already got it and I thought they're doing it right this time because you have to have an experience with Jesus Christ you have to that is the basis you must be born again it's the simplest thing but without a new birth you're building a nice building but there's no life there until the life comes in and that life has a purpose it's so that the uh you can teach Sinners or transgressors the way and sinners shall come to be converted and we can look at that of course as Jews Gentiles there's lots of different types and shadows we can go there with but that conversion he said there that repent and be converted and then he gave us a certain time we'll go back to that uh there's a certain time frame in which that conversion comes forth to where sin is completely blotted out another scripture where it says at the time of refreshing it's completely blotted out my praise the Lord I get so used to looking all this stuff up on my phone I and plus this Bible's kind of falling apart I just bought a new one I haven't had our chance to even get into it act three uh okay repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and the time frame he gives is the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord where does it come from the presence of the Lord and it's at a certain time called the time of restitution or when everything is restored to its natural or original form there is a time frame we've had all these seven Church ages that the spirit of God was moving the life of God was in it all the way from the first you know that Spirit of the lion that came out and prophesied all the things that are in this book about the end time are they happening absolutely read second Timothy read uh Romans and how they you know woman with woman and man with all those things and we see it happening because the life of God set those things into position for a reason he did it because the times of the presence of the Lord are here not just on the outside but on the inside because he's manifesting the kingdom of God within us and that's there for a reason so that people can see your life and want to change actually really want to change and to see something that you know we just sitting on the airplane yesterday coming down here uh a little lady I don't know where she goes to church but I didn't even get to talk to her very much but before we got off the plane because the other guy that was sitting right next to me we were talking back and forth a little bit about the Lord and she heard just enough that she saw me hand him a book and she kind of looked at me and go you want one too and she goes yeah because she heard just enough and she only heard maybe 5 minutes worth but it was enough that it gave her the desire I want more and that's that's part of that's what we're here for that's what you're doing this with your lives because the power of God is moving in this time of restitution as he is restoring us to our fullness our natural position of Eternal creatures in Jesus Christ we talk about Rapture and I know there's things out there and you know brother brother bham said you know there won't be a lot of people in that Rapture and yet in another way there will because the resurrected Saints are going to be part of it too and there's seven Church Ages full of them that's right but it's all in what brings and on the scene is the presence of the Lord not just God above us but God in us that's the rest where he said back there with the in in chapter 7 he said where's the place of my rest how be it Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot tool what house will you build me and what is the place of my rest he's building a house he's building a house in each and every life here tonight but then he asks the question where's my rest well we know that the rest is the Holy Ghost you go Isaiah 28 for stammering lips in another tongue will I speak to my people and that for this is my rest some heard some didn't hear didn't want to hear but God's rest is in this building place of what we call the word of God of moving the words and the things that are in this book into our personal experience moving those words out of the bottle as it were and not just into our mouths but swallowing it remember the scripture in Revelations where he said go and eat the book he didn't just go go chew on it and if it's too hard spit it out no eat it right yes and sometimes it's bitter in the stomach sometimes it's hard when we have certain persecutions and things like that but here Jesus even when he gave us that scripture about the kingdom of God is within you they were demanding of him can you imagine that he's just you know he's just a guy that God is using if you look at it in a natural sense and here the Great and Mighty priests are demanding tell us tell us tell us he said hey he doesn't even answer them what they ask for but he let his life show what it really was and with the power of God and what this restitution this time we're in this time of restitution we are in this time of another place it says the dispensation of the fullness of times we have come to time in its fullness we have come to where a prophet of God called an angel on the scene that said time shall be no longer time for the believer is approaching its end because we are going into the receiving or the restitution of the fullness of God which takes us back into etern ET ity to which there's no time the world will go right on in time they got to you know they're going to have a tribulation and they're going to have all kinds of other stuff but for the Believers the fullness or the full restitution and the dispensation is not uh in that place if you look it up it's not it's a time frame very Loosely but more importantly it's dispensa or giving to those each one there what they have coming it's dispensing like you you go to the doctor's office or whatever and they dispense the drugs or you go to the wherever it is and they dispense things they give you your portion happened to be in uh Honduras and went to a wedding that uh the daddy is a very wealthy to man owns some of those Big Oil freighter and stuff and they said he spent uh in our money roughly $200,000 for this wedding well he has the money that even dispensing everyone with a meal of steak and rack of lamb and those things I'm going wow this is some wedding and but he was dispensing actually as a portion of his wealth to about 450 people in a beautiful beautiful arrangement banquet and all those things and at the time of the dispensation God begins dispensing your portion my portion right he's given us oh but sometimes we can he said you don't have because you don't ask for it and I'm bad with some people say well if you need something ask me and I usually don't I ask God first occasionally I I I do when brother Stan was here last summer and we had the broken thing on the fifth wheel the thing that rolls out Stan said can I do anything for you and I said do you know anything about how to fix awnings fortunately he did he goes yeah I fixed two or three of those so sometimes it never hurts to ask but to remember that every time we come to the scripture even when we come to church it's not about me it's not about you individually there's more there you're coming here not to just receive of oursel because we've already received it it's already part of your life that kingdom of God if you have received Jesus Christ it's in you and it's not in you just so you can feel happy all the time right it's in you so as that scripture said so that transgressors can see that life and be hungry was talking to Paul and and you know I saw a lot of when we first came to what we call the message I saw a lot of negative gospel you know uh and they just pound on it and pound on it certain things and certain doctrines and stuff and I I said at some point I got to where it's like it's not doing any good for me to you know walk down the street and say hey lady you going know you look like a harlot because you cut C your hair that does no good but I was telling Paul and I've done this several times and I happen to think of another one after we left Paul of a girl obviously not what we would call a Believer but she had hair down just about to her knees and it did it looked beautiful and and as I walked by her I think it was in the grocery store uh I said why don't how you don't cut your hair and she goes no I I I want it to be like this and I said well the Bible says It's Your Glory don't cut it and I said it makes you look glorious and I just started to walk off and she goes I mean she started crying she goes thank you for telling me that she goes I never wanted to cut it and she goes just thank you thank you you got to start somewhere and to think that you know it was that important for her to hear that it's a simp simple thing you can do it you don't have to be a preacher if you see something or something or someone does something for you uh I was thinking here uh I don't remember if it was I think it was at a little restaurant or maybe it was one of the restaurants in the airport I don't remember exactly where it was but I went to pay for something and I didn't have the right of money and I was oh man okay so I'm going to get out you know I had a larger bill or something and the lady goes no don't don't do that don't do that she goes I have a little jar hidden behind the computer there she goes I want to pay for it for you how often do you see that nowadays I went really and she goes yeah yeah don't don't I don't want to mess with your and as I walked away I just said God bless that woman for her desire to serve someone else with her life that's what being a Christian is really about that's what this water gives freely of its life gives freely I didn't have to okay water look man I'm going to take a drink and I'm expecting you you hear me it's Merry Christmas and don't forget about it no you just drink it and when you drink it the life comes with it and this gospel and this praying and and this song and you know in in it comes from the presence of God and in the psalm it was you know take don't take that presence away from me let that life that comes from that presence when Solomon prayed when that life came they couldn't talk about it but they became a part of it and when the life comes you may not have to talk about it you may not God bless you Sister sua just noticed I noticed earlier but I haven't seen her for a long time I love her smile it means something to me and every one of you have a life that it's not and I know you've heard the statement brother brandom said eternal life is living for what for yourself no it's for living for somebody else and it can be so simple it can be just as simple as those two little dots to where a whole dispensation can open up in somebody's life or even in my life or your life simply by doing something for somebody else it can actually begin to dispens or to give God to someone else I remember took a few years before I ever actually LED somebody to Jesus Christ partly I guess because well bottom line I was probably afraid I I thought always had to be done in a church with a preacher it doesn't right I remember praying with a man on a forest fire everybody said the guy was crazy he was actually he was literally crazy he had a chemical problem I mean they have you know the ad HDs and all that stuff but this guy had an adrenaline problem that everybody on the cruise said don't ever make him mad because they said a guy came out he was late for work and this guy came after him cuz he owed him a little bit of money and he said I don't have time I'll get you your money but I don't have time right now I'm late for work and the guy said no I want it right now and he said they they watched him pick this man up and throw him all the way over a car they said don't make him mad because he was crazy and yet we were just the two two of us were working this one big section on a fire and it was a Sunday morning and we and I stopped and I was just thinking about the Lord praying a little bit he came over and said what are you thinking about and I started talking to him and just telling him some things about Jesus Christ friend it was one of the strongest anointings I have felt in my life for that what people called a crazy man just tell somebody about Jesus Christ and better yet let that life live through you in something you say or something you do something you do for somebody else and not doing it as a Works program but doing it because the love of God lives in us well faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and as we begin to learn to let God use us to dis pensate or to give of his gifts of his life then that becomes an inexhaustable Fountain and that life will grow more and more and because I like to think of it I remember brother Sergeant one time we were talking before he passed away and uh he's the first man that ever said hey that's uh you know that's your Pulpit every other week he said you're gifted just get up there and I was like man really at that point in my life I might have preached three or four times and so I told him one time not too long before he passed away I knew he was concerned we get concerned especially with age the youngsters aren't getting any younger and as we we get concerned you know has my life really been what you know worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ have I really met and fulfilled all of the things that God wanted to do for me and if I look at myself and I have to say no I I made a lot of mistakes and I missed God in different areas but the fullness behind it if the Life of Christ has been fully manifested or before we leave this planet as we think of it then I'm not failed because it's all about Jesus Christ and if even one sinner comes to Christ because of your life brother ROM said that's 10,000 worlds yeah how much value is that I can't even imagine it another place he had a million worlds because that life becomes Eternal because your life was a dispensation at a particular time when and sin is blotted out the example and I I know we used it maybe last time brother random said if we put all of our sin in that eye dropper and dropped it into that bucket or barrel of bleach he said that bleach has the power to remove that all the stuff that's in that Dr ink dropper in one place he says as though it never existed not even God will remember our God who remembers everything will not remember something that never existed right because that he said he created it all and if it becomes something that never existed he didn't create it and he won't remember it put your sin if you have it into the bleach and let the life of Jesus Christ live and I'll close with this uh from John the first chapter and this I know you're really familiar with this starts out first verse in the beginning was the word word was with God Word was God we understand that that's logos in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the word or the logos was God that's the power behind behind the life it's not just the written word Rema is the written word that's these little words on paper that have been formed it's like it's the building part of this church but the logos is the people that are here the life in the beginning was the life and the which was the word and the Word was God and so then it and we're familiar with this and it was you know it was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him not anything was made in him was what life it's about the life of Jesus Christ and the life was the light of men the life that we people can see when you've had your drink and they see that life it becomes a light to them and uh just that light begins to emanate through Us in spite of the trials in spite of all the other things it's the life of God manifesting and it says and the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness comprehends it not no the darkness doesn't comprehend it but there's people out there who need and want and desire to see just a Flicker and if even you just give them a flicker friends sometimes it can light some and I I hadn't thought about it but the the story brother renam told about the man that was at the car lot and somebody put a tract on the windshield and he read the tract and all he remembered in the tract was that where will you spend eternity and it actually upset the man he watered it up and threw it away through the tract away now there's people would say oh he just blasphemed the Holy Ghost but no no not at all because from that moment on that man's life changed he went home his wife was a Christian and he said I want to go to church with you which was a big surprise to her you want to go where and and and he went to that church and this church and then he went to this you know Billy Graham and all these different places and finally he was beginning to think maybe he'd send away his day of Grace and done something wrong and somebody said well you know if you're that Disturbed there's a prophet lives down such and such and he went and had an interview and the way it went in the interview he said brother you got the Holy Ghost the day you read that tract and that's what led you to me to hear because it wasn't me as in brother Brandon but it was the Holy Spirit the life struck him when he read the tract and it led him through all kinds of things toils and snares but it led him to the source Jesus Christ speaking to that man through a prophet the fullness of Jesus Christ so to finish he says uh he came unto I me down dropping down to verse 11 it says and he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him that's a person it's not just written word it's not just message books or message tapes it's a personal relationship that you have with Jesus Christ that you surrender your heart I surrendered my heart to a a person and to as many as received him that's the personal presence of Jesus Christ CHR to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name amen that's pretty simple when you get right down to it receive him and the power is there what he said ask what you will we always I I tend to think of all the big things and all the stuff that you know we think of that as power but the power is to become Sons and Daughters of God what house is he building he's building a house a temple from the inside out through his son Jesus Christ and he what's the criteria believe on his name the name he said and the word are the same thing and here it's the word or the life and it even says in him is life let the life of God not just for yourself not just for myself but for someone else remember the tree is supposed to bear fruit remember brother Stan saying that we are here to bear fruit for other people and sometimes it's small sometimes they'll turn and ren you they'll trample you but that's part of the the receiving even as he received you love him tonight amen praise the Lord sister sister you know that song creating me a clean heart can we sing that that be all right he gives us many has received him that's the personal and it's so important too because when you go to where Peter was asked that question who do men say that I am and he gave that proper truth you're the Christ the son of the Living God and he said that uh Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that but my Father which is in heaven and and so we realize it's a revelation and then when he goes to the tomb of Lazarus and the question came up you know about the resurrection he didn't say oh you know uh Martha in 2,000 years there's going to be a resurrection and give her a bunch of Doctrine he said I am the resurrection and he even went a little further and said I am the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and he that believeth in me and is alive shall never die isn't that interesting it's the person of Jesus Christ in your life brother like that smile man it's so simple just think of it as those two little dots it CH they change everything let those two little dots that time frame that he's given us use it to speak to someone else to do something for somebody that they can say wow that was Jesus I've had people you know things that I didn't think meant anything and people say wow that was from the Lord what are you talking about it's a life that he gives so that we can give God bless you let's stand and sing this and sing it as a [Music] prayer oh create in me a clean heart oh God and reew a right Spirit Within Me cre in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me and cast me not away from
