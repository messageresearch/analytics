[11:38] Once a sinner far from Jesus, I was
[11:42] perishing with cold. But the bladed
[11:46] saint heard me when I cried.
[11:50] Then he threw his robe around me and he
[11:54] led me to his fold. And I'm living on
[11:58] the hallelujah side.
[12:02] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[12:06] hallelujah's roy
[12:10] praises far and wide.

[12:18] windows of my soul, and I'm living on
[12:22] the hallelujah side.
[12:26] Though the world may sweep around me
[12:29] with her dazzle and her dream, yet I am.
[12:38] For my soul looks up to heaven where the
[12:41] golden sunlight gleams. And I'm living
[12:45] on the hallelujah side.

[13:09] hallelujah side.
[13:13] Not for all those golden millions when I
[13:17] leave this precious place. Though the
[13:19] tempter to persuade me off has tried.
[13:25] For I'm safe in God's pavilion, happy in
[13:29] his love and grace. And I'm living on

[14:41] living on the hallelujah side
[14:46] and upon the streets of glory. When we
[14:50] reach the other shore and have safely
[14:54] crossed the Jordan's rolling tide,
[14:58] you will find me shouting glory just
[15:01] outside my mansion door where I'm living
[15:05] on the hallelujah side.
[15:10] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[15:13] hallelujah roll me ring my Savior's
[15:17] praises far and wide.

[15:47] &gt;&gt; Does anybody ever get I don't know. I
[15:50] sing to myself all the time. My daughter
[15:52] and I were joking about we sing in the
[15:54] car and sometimes, you know, you belt it
[15:56] out, whatever.
[15:58] But when I get a song stuck in my head,
[16:00] I don't know about you, when I get a
[16:02] song stuck in my head, I will go to
[16:03] sleep and it's going to my head and
[16:06] that's all I dream about sometimes.

[16:11] God. Sometimes you just get something in
[16:13] there and but it makes you makes you
[16:15] think about I don't know. You wake up

[37:16] Let's just stand and sing it one more
[37:17] time. Just sing it out to him. Just tell
[37:20] him you want more of him in your life.
[37:22] Amen. Raise your hands and praise him
[37:24] this morning.
[37:27] Amen.
[37:29] More
[37:31] of you.
[37:36] More
[37:38] of you.
[37:43] I've had it all,
[37:47] but what I need is more of you.
[37:56] of things I've had my fill.
[38:04] But yet I hunger
[38:07] still
[38:16] prayer for more
[38:19] of you.
[38:22] empty and bare.
[38:26] Lord, hear my prayer
[38:30] for more
[38:32] of you.
[38:34] [Music]
[38:37] God bless you this morning, saints.
[38:40] Always find it amazing. I don't know why
[38:42] we don't
[38:44] maybe God intended for us to just find
[38:47] it amazing but how that we can come and
[38:50] just a song service
[38:53] someone else's
[38:54] anointing that's been laid upon them can
[38:58] just touch right down a vein that you
[39:00] know God's been dealing with you just
[39:03] your thoughts and it just comes right to
[39:05] you and you realize you know
[39:08] we as humans may never come in a natural
[39:12] one mind and one accord.
[39:15] Amen. It won't come in that human
[39:17] element that we all just view everything
[39:19] the same. But when the Holy Spirit
[39:21] starts to move, draws us right into one
[39:24] mind and one accord, one desire of our
[39:27] hearts, leading us in one direction to
[39:30] come in the presence of God. Amen. I I
[39:34] bring greetings. Uh, brother Isaac
[39:37] already shared the need, a reminder of
[39:40] the needs in Venezuela.
[39:42] Uh, and uh, what's happening with the
[39:45] saints there as as time goes forward,
[39:48] it's if you can even find the product,
[39:51] if you can even find the the loaf of
[39:54] bread or the gallon of milk, uh, the
[39:57] prices, um, their currency devalues
[40:00] every single day. And uh it just put a
[40:05] lot of pressure. But God is faithful.
[40:07] Can someone say amen this morning? God
[40:09] is faithful and he is supplying needs.
[40:13] But uh we just want to do the greatest
[40:15] thing as brother Brandham said, the
[40:17] greatest thing we can do for someone is
[40:20] to pray for them. Amen. So we could send
[40:23] all the money in the world, but uh we
[40:26] know the scripture tells us that the
[40:27] poor will be with us always. And that
[40:30] has nothing to do with our salvation.
[40:32] But let's not let the ease of our life
[40:36] right
[40:36] &gt;&gt; cause us to become lukewarm. Amen. Let
[40:40] us remain on fire. So I bring greetings
[40:42] from brother George Smith to you and uh
[40:46] desire for you to pray. I want to speak
[40:48] to you today. Amen. On the thought or
[40:51] title, God bless you musicians. Thank
[40:53] you very much. Amen. On being complete
[40:57] in him. Amen. and we take this out uh of
[41:02] um scripture and message and um we will
[41:06] just uh by God's grace be able to
[41:08] expound upon this as you turn in
[41:10] Colossians the 2 chapter verses 1-10
[41:15] um and uh you know it's interesting how
[41:19] when the Lord lays something on your
[41:21] heart you don't even remember that
[41:23] certain scripture contain certain words
[41:27] and so as you you turn uh to these
[41:31] things, you come back and realize wait
[41:34] here Colossians the 2 chapter first
[41:36] verse he he says I for I would that you
[41:40] know what great conflict I have for you
[41:43] for them at Le Oysia. So there is a a
[41:47] great conflict for the needs of the
[41:50] saints of the believers at Leodysia. So,
[41:53] amen. God was mindful. Placed us right
[41:56] here in the scripture. And you say,
[41:58] "Well, but that was for a different time
[42:00] and place." No, twofold. Amen. It's for
[42:03] this day. And for as many as have not
[42:07] seen my face in the flesh, that their
[42:09] hearts might be comforted, being knit
[42:11] together in love, and at all riches of
[42:13] the full assurance of understanding to
[42:16] the acknowledgment of the mystery of
[42:18] God.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; And this actually started out uh in a in
[42:23] my little study on the mystery of God.
[42:26] And that's what brought me originally to
[42:28] to Colossians was just studying in the
[42:31] mystery and then it just started to
[42:33] unfold. Amen. And of the Father and of
[42:37] Christ, in whom are hid all the
[42:39] treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And
[42:43] this I say, lest any man should beguile
[42:45] you with enticing words. For though I be
[42:48] absent in the flesh, yet am I with you
[42:51] in spirit, joying and beholding your
[42:54] order and the steadfastness of your
[42:57] faith in Christ. Now, beholding your
[43:00] order, my brother and sister, this study
[43:02] goes a little deeper. I'll just touch
[43:04] the edge of it. But you see, God sets
[43:07] everything in order. He is not an author
[43:10] of chaos. And so this being in order is
[43:15] that we as believers would come and in
[43:19] the way that God has brought it to us,
[43:22] the way he's revealed his word, that we
[43:25] can see how to be orderly. And you can
[43:28] study those words out. Be orderly not
[43:32] only in the house of God, which we
[43:34] should be in our own households, as we
[43:37] should be,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; but in our everyday life. Right.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Be orderly. Amen. So, it's a bigger
[43:46] subject than that. So, I I'll just move
[43:48] on from there. Amen. And so, in this
[43:52] order and steadfastness
[43:55] of your faith in Christ, as you have
[43:57] therefore received Christ Jesus the
[43:59] Lord, so walk ye in him, rooted and
[44:02] built up in him, established in the
[44:04] truth, as you have been taught,
[44:06] abounding therein with thanksgiving.
[44:10] Beware, lest any man spoil you through
[44:13] philosophy and vain deceit, after the
[44:15] tradition of men, after the rudiments of
[44:18] the world, and not after Christ. So this
[44:22] verse right here, if you expand on it or
[44:25] expound on it, you'll realize that verse
[44:28] 8 is where the denominational church of
[44:31] this day is at. They are in philosophy.
[44:35] They are in deceit. And they're in a
[44:38] tradition of men. That's right.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; When they write their books that say,
[44:41] "If you're going to be a good whatever
[44:44] it might be, you will do this and this
[44:47] and this." We were uh in in the parking
[44:51] lot and sister Jerry pointed out to me a
[44:54] vehicle that uh was saying, "Pray the
[44:57] rosary to bring peace to it,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; to save America." Amen. Now my brother
[45:04] and sister, you can have all the
[45:06] rosaries you want. It won't save
[45:09] America.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. Now maybe the
[45:13] original intention of the rosary was
[45:16] maybe focused in somewhat the right
[45:18] direction that they they wanted
[45:20] something a way of worship. But you see,
[45:22] they worship their tradition now,
[45:26] not the god that they thought they were.
[45:30] And so we have to be very careful that
[45:33] we do not come after the rudiments of
[45:35] the world and not after Christ. For in
[45:37] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[45:39] godhead bodily and ye are complete in
[45:43] him which is the head of all
[45:45] principality and power.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Heavenly father we just ask you to bless
[45:50] the service today. Lord just help us
[45:52] father to speak what you desire to be
[45:54] spoken. Anoint the word to each heart
[45:57] father to each need. We ask in the name
[46:00] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[46:02] seated. Amen. And as I was reading this
[46:06] scripture, being led there, as I said,
[46:08] uh looking at mystery and uh looking
[46:12] that and coming, it just something
[46:13] leaped out as it were. And I thought,
[46:16] there's really where the Lord was
[46:18] bringing me to to look at this thought
[46:20] of being complete in him. And uh it just
[46:23] really caught my heart. And I thought,
[46:25] you know, that's what we want to be. We
[46:27] can be a, if you don't mind me just
[46:29] speaking it kind of bluntly, we can be a
[46:31] good message believer and and fulfill
[46:34] everything that the tenants of the
[46:36] message lay out before us. But my
[46:39] brother and sister, if we're not rooted
[46:40] in him, then we might as well
[46:44] pray to the rosary.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Is that a little blunt?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; But it's true,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; right? The relationship's not with the
[46:52] church.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; It's with Jesus Christ. That's where we
[46:56] have to be is in him. And if we're
[46:59] always feeling insufficient, now I know
[47:02] that if we were honest with ourselves
[47:04] this morning, I would never ask you to
[47:05] lift your hands, but I'll just be the
[47:07] guinea pig. I'll lift my hand. I feel
[47:10] insufficient all the time. I feel like I
[47:12] could have done more here. I could have
[47:14] done better there. I should have this. I
[47:16] should have that. But my brother and
[47:17] sister, you have to come to a place that
[47:20] your confidence in Jesus Christ is so
[47:22] great that when the word says that you
[47:25] are complete in him, you will bypass or
[47:28] overlook every shortcoming you feel in
[47:31] your life and say the word says I'm
[47:33] going to be complete in him and I
[47:36] believe that I will be complete in him.
[47:38] Is it a long drawn out process? Yes.
[47:41] Maybe it might be a very long drawn out
[47:43] process but God has called us. Amen.
[47:46] Remember the word says you are elect.
[47:49] Now elect is not by chance. Elect is
[47:52] chosen. And we are standing here this
[47:54] morning as sons and daughters of God. We
[47:57] have been elected of God. And we have
[48:00] been chosen of God to fulfill his word.
[48:03] Now it's not necessarily how you feel
[48:06] about it. But let me tell you, if you
[48:09] have a confidence of who you are in
[48:12] Jesus Christ, it will change your entire
[48:15] outlook on the word of God. You'll no
[48:17] longer be looking at this as woe unto
[48:20] me. But you'll look at this and say,
[48:22] "Wait, I was chosen and I am going to
[48:25] live to the standard that I was called
[48:28] to." Amen. We were not called or chosen
[48:30] to be mediocre Christians. We were not
[48:33] called to be those that said, "Well, if
[48:35] I was only this, if I was only that."
[48:38] But human nature, Amen. We are humans
[48:40] here today, aren't we? Amen. You know,
[48:43] on the internet, you don't know what's
[48:44] AI and what's real anymore, right? They
[48:47] that they're blurring the lines of it.
[48:49] And I want you to know that doesn't have
[48:51] to do with a commercial about a car or
[48:54] this, that, or the other. That's what
[48:55] Satan is doing. He's so blurring the
[48:58] lines between what is real and what is
[49:01] not that people without the Holy Ghost
[49:03] can't tell the difference.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; But you've been called, elected, chosen
[49:08] to know the difference. Something inside
[49:10] of you is there speaking to you saying
[49:13] this is the word and I believe it
[49:16] absolutely. Amen. So it's there that I
[49:19] love those words complete in him. Now, I
[49:22] don't think I gave this uh I know I
[49:25] didn't give this to to the brothers, but
[49:27] uh brother Brandham in the sermon uh
[49:29] water baptism, he says this uh words
[49:32] right here. And you are complete in him,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; not in no church. Now, this is pretty
[49:38] blunt. Some people might not like this
[49:40] quote and I'm sorry if you don't, but
[49:42] not in no church, not in the Brham
[49:45] tabernacle, not in the association, but
[49:49] you are complete and safe in Jesus
[49:52] Christ. Amen. So, as message believers,
[49:56] we wouldn't say we're message believers
[49:58] if we didn't believe God sent a prophet
[50:00] in this hour. If we didn't believe that
[50:03] he sent a word and opened it to you and
[50:06] I, the word that would be our path to
[50:08] redemption, a word that would uh break
[50:11] forth a seed that's in us and and start
[50:14] to see life come forward. We wouldn't
[50:16] claim to be that if we didn't believe
[50:19] that or we shouldn't anyway. Let's be
[50:21] honest with ourselves. So it's there as
[50:23] we come as message believers, we realize
[50:26] the very significance that brother
[50:28] Brandham's saying that it's not in no
[50:31] church and not in Brandham Tabernacle.
[50:34] Amen. So we could go to church in
[50:36] Brandham Tabernacle all the days of our
[50:38] life and miss it. If you remember, there
[50:40] was a neighbor of brother Brandham. She
[50:42] come to church. Amen. And they ask her,
[50:44] you know, hey, I I don't remember the
[50:46] exact wording, but you know, it's like
[50:48] you you don't really change. You don't
[50:49] really follow it. and she says, "Oh, I
[50:51] go just because I love to hear Billy
[50:54] preach."
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; That's what she got out of it was
[50:57] something that that she just loved to
[50:59] hear him preach. She was not receiving
[51:02] the depth of the revelation that God was
[51:05] using a prophet to unfold. She just
[51:08] enjoyed how he preached. Amen. I imagine
[51:11] today, if you don't mind me being this
[51:12] blunt, there's a lot of people go to
[51:14] church to a certain church because they
[51:16] like the way the preacher preaches. But
[51:19] we're here today, my brother and sister,
[51:21] because we like how the Holy Spirit
[51:24] speaks to us.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; It's not about the man himself that
[51:28] stands up and opens a book and has a
[51:30] thought and presents it to you, but we
[51:32] need to be in love with the voice.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that voice is what's speaking
[51:37] to you and I, bringing us ever closer to
[51:40] him. Amen. Now, let's turn in Hebrews
[51:44] the 12th chapter:es 1 through3. Amen.
[51:48] Now this scripture, we all know it so
[51:51] well. Amen. Very well. Wherefore, seeing
[51:54] we're also compassed about with so great
[51:57] a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[52:00] every weight
[52:02] &gt;&gt; and the sin which does so easily beset
[52:05] us, and let us run with patience the
[52:07] race that is set before us. Now, before
[52:10] I get too far from this verse, we have a
[52:13] cloud of witnesses.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's interesting because you
[52:17] see when that witness was fresh,
[52:22] there was there were those that would
[52:24] not agree with it. But as time has went
[52:27] on and the witnesses are slowly being
[52:29] taken from the scene. They're passing
[52:31] from the scene.
[52:33] And you know, as you look at that, you
[52:36] realize that that those that were
[52:38] firsthand
[52:40] are now disappearing,
[52:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:43] And the voice of dissent
[52:45] is rising up
[52:47] &gt;&gt; as though it never happened. That's not
[52:50] the way it was. It wasn't this. It
[52:52] wasn't that. But you see, when it was
[52:54] present,
[52:56] they didn't raise up. They didn't have a
[52:58] voice against it. You notice the voices
[53:00] of descent become louder the further
[53:03] they got from Egypt.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And the closer they got to the promised
[53:07] land, the voices of dissent got bold.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they come out and they
[53:12] declared that Moses was a mistake and
[53:14] Moses wasn't able and Moses had this
[53:17] problem and that problem. But my brother
[53:19] and sister, as the closer they got to
[53:21] the promised land, the voice of disscent
[53:24] rose, but the faith of the people, in
[53:27] this case, we understand the scripture,
[53:29] it was those that had been through Egypt
[53:31] and been influenced by the spirits of
[53:33] Egypt, the influence of Leodysia, if you
[53:36] want to put it that way. They had been
[53:39] conditioned to a place that if God
[53:41] didn't just do it like they thought it
[53:43] should be done, then God must not be
[53:44] going to do it. But God said, "I gave
[53:47] you a promise. I will perform my
[53:49] promise."
[53:51] &gt;&gt; And so it was that God registered or
[53:53] laid it down into the heart of the
[53:55] younger generation. Amen. And I believe
[53:57] virtually in our midst here. Now I you
[54:00] might say, "Brother Paul, you're missing
[54:02] this. Making an assumption." But I think
[54:04] spiritually every one of us will qualify
[54:06] under a younger generation. Amen. Where
[54:09] the opening of the word is coming to its
[54:11] full fruition. Amen. Not talking about
[54:13] the word in theory, so to speak, or
[54:15] talking about the word in a faroff
[54:17] promise, but a word coming to pass. A
[54:19] word that's brought right before us
[54:21] that's very, very real. And we know it's
[54:25] real. Amen. And so as it was that
[54:27] generation come and they're getting
[54:30] there and it comes and I always like
[54:32] this sorry if I've used it too many
[54:33] times through the years but they come to
[54:35] the Jordan River. Amen. And they were
[54:38] those men not trying to be uh dissenters
[54:41] not trying to push against it but they
[54:44] looked around. Now you have to
[54:46] understand maybe maybe to some of you
[54:49] it'd be like the perfect house in the
[54:52] perfect subdivision.
[54:54] To me, I relate to this scripture
[54:57] because the less houses there are and no
[54:59] subdivisions.
[55:01] Yeah, me too.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And they looked out and said, "Moses,
[55:06] how about we just stay right here on
[55:09] this side of the river? This is a land
[55:12] for cattle and we are men of cattle and
[55:16] this is paradise." But Moses, I mean,
[55:19] Joshua tells them, tells them, he says,
[55:21] "No, if you don't cross over," and we'll
[55:24] just interpret it and lay this right
[55:25] out. You don't cross over and get the
[55:27] Holy Ghost, you'll die just like your
[55:29] parents died.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; That'll be an unbelief. It's not talking
[55:33] about the effect of old age or sickness
[55:36] or what, but of unbelief. Going to die
[55:38] of unbelief. And those men caught that
[55:41] revelation because they had been
[55:42] conditioned under this ministry to to
[55:46] recognize that God has expectation and
[55:49] God wants us to do so. There when Joshua
[55:51] speaks to them and says, "Unless you
[55:53] cross over, but once you've crossed
[55:55] over, you can come back and you can
[55:57] start that business. You can have that
[55:59] ranch. You can have these things, but
[56:01] get the Holy Ghost first."
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That younger generation, they
[56:05] didn't fight. They didn't argue. They
[56:07] didn't do anything. They said, "Okay,
[56:08] we've got to go over into the promised
[56:10] land. Our footsteps must possess the
[56:13] promised land. And when they possess the
[56:16] promised land, we can come back and
[56:18] claim this prosperity we see in the
[56:21] gospel." Now, the problem, my brother
[56:22] and sister, with the prosperity gospel
[56:24] of this age is they're not getting
[56:26] crossed over. Amen. They're just
[56:28] settling for the prosperity. Amen. So,
[56:31] when they have the prosperity, the
[56:33] scripture tells us that it brings many
[56:34] woes and thorns in the flesh. That's why
[56:37] whether you're successful or not, you
[56:39] need to make sure you got the Holy Ghost
[56:41] because that money will become a thorn
[56:44] and destroy your life. Amen. But when
[56:47] you got the Holy Ghost, that money looks
[56:49] like an entirely different tool. Amen. A
[56:53] whole different approach to that money
[56:55] once you have the Holy Ghost. But
[56:56] without it, it has a destruction. So
[57:00] it's there as we'll look at this now. It
[57:02] says we're compassed with so great a
[57:04] cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside
[57:07] every weight and the sin which so does
[57:09] easily beset us and let us run with
[57:12] patience. In other words, you don't get
[57:15] up in the morning, tie your tennies, and
[57:16] you've won the race.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; You've got to go out. You need a few
[57:21] blisters. You need a little fatigue. You
[57:23] need a little tiredness. You need a
[57:25] little struggle. You need a little sweat
[57:26] and blood and whatever it might be. You
[57:29] have to run it. But run it with
[57:31] patience.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; A mad dash does not finish a marathon,
[57:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:37] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[57:39] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[57:41] that was set before him, endured the
[57:44] cross, despised the shame. Have you
[57:47] caught that before? He didn't just put
[57:49] the shame as no account. He despised the
[57:52] shame. In other words, he belittled the
[57:56] shame. This is what you have to offer.
[57:58] You're trying to say, "Oh, he's dying on
[58:00] a cross and that's that is a shame." He
[58:03] says, "No, dying on the cross is the
[58:06] ultimate sacrifice I did for you." Amen.
[58:10] I'm willing to bear any shame. I despise
[58:13] that shame because that's what it takes
[58:16] to bring you into a place where you can
[58:18] possess the promise. Oh, my brother and
[58:21] sister, look what he did for us. People
[58:22] today won't even hardly pray in public.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they say, "Well, we're
[58:26] Christians." But they won't. They won't.
[58:28] And I'm not speaking down on that. I
[58:30] used to do. I've shared it with the
[58:31] church here. I used to do that head and
[58:35] uh you know in the midst of all that
[58:37] Lord bless my food uh and go on and eat
[58:40] and then one day I realized you know
[58:41] what I'm ashamed of him
[58:43] &gt;&gt; that's pretty blunt talk isn't it
[58:46] &gt;&gt; but I'm ashamed of him
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and something you might say snapped or
[58:50] changed inside of me and I started
[58:53] saying you know what if I'm ashamed of
[58:56] him he's ashamed of me
[59:00] &gt;&gt; right
[59:01] &gt;&gt; now I want Everybody just take a few
[59:03] breaths here and ponder that
[59:05] &gt;&gt; if we're ashamed of him,
[59:08] he's ashamed of us.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want something so simple
[59:15] as that
[59:17] &gt;&gt; to set me out of fellowship.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be bold.
[59:22] We live in a world today, my brother and
[59:24] sister, where boldness is is just the
[59:28] norm of everything.
[59:30] And the true church
[59:34] while we say I don't want to offend
[59:36] anybody.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Who are we offending?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Don't act don't act so serious.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; But you're going to decide you're going
[59:53] to offend somebody.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; You're either going to Let's cut it
[59:56] right to the chase. You're going to
[59:57] either offend the devil
[59:59] &gt;&gt; or you're going to offend our Lord Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Don't bring it. I don't want to offend
[1:00:04] my neighbor. I don't want to offend my
[1:00:05] boss. I don't want to offend this. No.
[1:00:06] No. It comes down to you're either going
[1:00:08] to offend the devil or you're going to
[1:00:10] offend our Lord Jesus Christ. You're
[1:00:12] either going to bless the devil or
[1:00:14] you're going to bless our Lord Jesus
[1:00:15] Christ. Amen. So, make it simple. Amen.
[1:00:19] As the old phrase is, keep it simple.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Consider him that endured such
[1:00:24] contradiction,
[1:00:27] such conflict of sinners against
[1:00:30] himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in
[1:00:34] your minds. So we have been compassed
[1:00:36] about with a great cloud of witnesses.
[1:00:39] We are not here today without witnesses
[1:00:42] that have experienced and professed a
[1:00:45] and given voice to the things that God
[1:00:49] has done. Now, some people would say,
[1:00:51] you know, I really don't know anybody
[1:00:54] that uh has has had a supernatural
[1:00:57] experience. My brother and sister, every
[1:00:59] man, woman, boy, or girl that ever come
[1:01:02] and fulfilled Acts 2:38 has fulfilled a
[1:01:07] supernatural
[1:01:08] experience. Don't let Satan degrade that
[1:01:12] down to I went and checked that off.
[1:01:15] That's a supernatural experience in the
[1:01:17] age that we're living in to repent and
[1:01:20] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:23] Amen. And receive the Holy Ghost. That
[1:01:25] is a supernatural event, my brother and
[1:01:28] sister. Just because the world today,
[1:01:30] everyone has received the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:32] Don't let that degrade the experience
[1:01:35] God has given to you. Amen. He made a
[1:01:38] promise to you.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[1:01:43] the Holy Spirit speaks to us. Can
[1:01:45] someone say amen?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; What it's doing is discerning the needs
[1:01:49] of the body. Now we'll find that when
[1:01:52] you when you look and as your network
[1:01:55] you might say grows larger you you'll be
[1:01:59] in contact with people on different
[1:02:01] continents and uh right here you know in
[1:02:04] North America different states and
[1:02:05] provinces and find that God is moving in
[1:02:08] very similar fashion. Now we are not my
[1:02:12] brother and sister robots. We are not
[1:02:14] AI. It's not going to be verbatim that
[1:02:18] everything is spoken. My brother and
[1:02:20] sister, the prophet of God said, you
[1:02:21] know what, I'm saying what Paul said,
[1:02:24] but he actually used different words,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; so it's not this idea that we have to
[1:02:32] become repeaters.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Parrots,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; but it's the fact of what the spirit
[1:02:39] leads, what the foundation of the word
[1:02:43] is. And the prophet of God stands very
[1:02:45] clearly and says I am preaching or I
[1:02:48] preached what Paul preached. So he
[1:02:51] wasn't a parrot. He didn't have to go
[1:02:53] and just read it from the scripture. In
[1:02:56] fact many things that brother Brandham
[1:02:57] actually brings out of the scripture we
[1:02:59] don't see with our eye when we read the
[1:03:02] scripture. But he links that out and he
[1:03:04] brings that out of what Paul thought
[1:03:06] what Paul saw how Paul's the revelation
[1:03:09] of it all. And if you look at that,
[1:03:11] you'd say, "He's outside the
[1:03:12] boundaries." And the word says,
[1:03:15] "Well, my brother and sister, you got to
[1:03:17] catch the spirit of it." That's right.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; You've got to get in that atmosphere.
[1:03:21] And when the prophet of God, when the
[1:03:23] angel come right down in there and he
[1:03:24] got in that atmosphere of it, it was no
[1:03:27] longer a man paring a man, but it was a
[1:03:30] man speaking what the Holy Spirit spoke.
[1:03:32] The same thing that was spoke to Paul
[1:03:34] was spoke to brother Brandham. And
[1:03:36] praise God, I hope you can get excited
[1:03:39] about this is being spoken today. Not
[1:03:42] from this pulpit, not from this man, but
[1:03:44] the Holy Ghost speaking to you.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Holy Ghost that's leading
[1:03:49] you and guiding you. If a man says,
[1:03:51] "I'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:03:53] truth." You have a right to be
[1:03:56] suspicious of that. But when the Holy
[1:03:58] Spirit comes and you know it's the Holy
[1:04:00] Spirit, you know it's the uh the word of
[1:04:03] God coming and he made the promise, I'll
[1:04:05] lead you and guide you to all truth, my
[1:04:07] brother and sister, you grab a hold of
[1:04:09] that. You don't let go. You don't let
[1:04:11] anybody with enticing words and and fine
[1:04:14] speech and things convince you any
[1:04:17] different because God promised you.
[1:04:20] Amen. He didn't promise Grace
[1:04:21] Tabernacle. He didn't promise Brandom
[1:04:23] Tabernacle. He promised you that he
[1:04:26] would lead you and guide you into all
[1:04:28] truth. Amen. It's time for us to reach
[1:04:30] out and take a hold of that promise. And
[1:04:32] when we have a halt of that promise,
[1:04:34] that word, and we follow him, we trust
[1:04:37] him. Amen. He won't fail you.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; He won't fail you. People say, "Well, I
[1:04:42] prayed that God would do this, this, and
[1:04:43] this." Well, you know, the thing is is
[1:04:46] I've I've had the personal experience of
[1:04:48] people and recounting the very prayer
[1:04:51] that they prayed. And I know this will
[1:04:54] sound judgmental, forgive me, but as
[1:04:56] they're recounting and I ask the Lord
[1:04:58] this, this, and this, and I'm thinking,
[1:05:00] that's a selfish prayer.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Is God here to satisfy our selfishness?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; No. He's here to bring us into truth.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we're praying selfish
[1:05:11] prayers, then is God obligated
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; to answer a selfish prayer?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; But when you say, "Lord, please lead
[1:05:20] me."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. guide me.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; I want all truth.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; I I want to I want to have your Holy
[1:05:27] Spirit. I want to be led by the word and
[1:05:30] I want to be drawn into your presence
[1:05:32] and this is what my desire is. And then
[1:05:34] it seems like things just go a whole
[1:05:36] different way than what you thought they
[1:05:39] would go.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; H
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit speaks discerning the
[1:05:49] needs of the body. And I would say this
[1:05:51] body.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; But it's also the individual needs of
[1:05:55] every person.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not just here for God to
[1:05:59] anoint a preacher to stand up and him to
[1:06:01] be satisfied that he spoke what God laid
[1:06:04] on his heart. If it doesn't affect you,
[1:06:06] if it doesn't reinforce or or bring to
[1:06:09] you an assurance that this is the word
[1:06:12] and touch some place of your life, then
[1:06:14] we're wasting our time.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's like going to a
[1:06:17] conference, you know, and and you know,
[1:06:19] hearing a wonderful speech, motivational
[1:06:22] people stand, give multiple ovations of
[1:06:25] this speech and walk out and go exactly
[1:06:28] right back into their life. Well, good
[1:06:30] was that.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; It's no good, saints. And and I'm not
[1:06:34] chastising you, but it's no good if we
[1:06:37] sit in church and say, "That's the
[1:06:38] truth. Amen. Hallelujah." And walk out
[1:06:41] the door and go right back into our
[1:06:43] life.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want a word that changes us.
[1:06:46] Can we say amen to that? Lord, give us a
[1:06:49] word that changes us. Amen. Draws us
[1:06:52] into your presence.
[1:06:59] A little shift in direction here. You
[1:07:01] know, Satan,
[1:07:03] if you want to be formal today, suit and
[1:07:06] tie, Lucifer
[1:07:12] has a sense of discernment. Sure.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; What can I throw in their way?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Well, this is what's happening in my
[1:07:29] life. Well, this is what's happening in
[1:07:33] our life. And it seems to be two
[1:07:38] entirely different things. Seems to be
[1:07:41] no connection at all. But I want you to
[1:07:44] understand the connection. What Satan is
[1:07:48] doing, Amen,
[1:07:51] is coming and discerning the need, you
[1:07:55] might say, or the condition of every
[1:07:57] person.
[1:07:59] So
[1:08:01] all he cares about is what stumbles you.
[1:08:03] That's it.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; It might be women over here, right? The
[1:08:06] three things that kill preachers. Might
[1:08:08] be women over here. Amen. It might be
[1:08:11] money over here, right? It might be
[1:08:13] popularity for this one over here. He's
[1:08:16] not going to go throw money at the
[1:08:18] person who could care less about money.
[1:08:21] And he's not going to go throw
[1:08:23] popularity at the one who doesn't even
[1:08:26] want to go in public, hates to speak in
[1:08:28] public. And he's not going to throw
[1:08:29] women in the face of the guy who's got a
[1:08:32] money problem.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Now, I know those are blunt, direct
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; approach. But you see, he's looking out
[1:08:40] here and today, saints, what he throws
[1:08:42] in your way, he might not throw in my
[1:08:45] way because it's it's not going to
[1:08:46] affect me. And what he throws in my way
[1:08:48] might not affect you or your brother or
[1:08:51] sister across the aisle. But Satan
[1:08:53] knowing what it is, it's going to cause
[1:08:55] you to stumble. That's what he throws in
[1:08:59] your way. And so as he throws these
[1:09:01] things out, Amen. imagine the Holy Ghost
[1:09:04] has a tailored message.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God speaking to you. Every one of
[1:09:09] you that's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] and experience with the Lord would share
[1:09:13] your story. And yes, there is a common
[1:09:16] theme, but your life may not be anything
[1:09:19] in common with those around you. But God
[1:09:21] knew exactly what to tailor to come to
[1:09:25] you. Amen. It's a story of the young man
[1:09:27] ready to go out and kill himself. And
[1:09:30] God deals with him directly. And a man
[1:09:33] sitting across the church said, "That
[1:09:35] was one of the worst sermons I've ever
[1:09:37] heard."
[1:09:39] See, one man, his life is spared, and he
[1:09:41] gives it to the Lord. The other one
[1:09:43] says, "This guy's boring. This guy, I
[1:09:46] don't know what he was talking about."
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; But you see, Satan has the same thing.
[1:09:51] He'll come and he knows exactly, right?
[1:09:54] The prophet of God clearly shows us that
[1:09:58] Satan's got his punch coming. Amen. Now,
[1:10:00] he's not going to try and hit you in the
[1:10:02] chin if you know how to guard your chin.
[1:10:04] Amen. But if you don't guard your knee,
[1:10:06] he might just hit you in the knee. Amen.
[1:10:09] Anyway, he's going to cause you to fall.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he wants to do is
[1:10:13] cause the fall. It doesn't have to be a
[1:10:16] textbook. This is the way we'll do it.
[1:10:18] Amen. He'll do it any way he can. So the
[1:10:21] stumbling stone or the stumbling block
[1:10:24] that he places in front of you might not
[1:10:26] affect anyone else. Amen. But it's there
[1:10:29] that he he offers so many things.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; He offers so many things and they're
[1:10:36] distractions.
[1:10:38] If Satan's offering it, it's a
[1:10:39] distraction.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; He's not here to help you on your
[1:10:43] journey.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think sometimes that money
[1:10:46] is going to make your spiritual life
[1:10:48] better.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes the ease of life, don't
[1:10:52] think, oh, I'll have more time to pray,
[1:10:54] you know. No, no. Satan will throw a
[1:10:57] distraction in there that steals your
[1:11:00] time. Amen. So, look at this. Sometimes
[1:11:04] these things, these distractions maybe
[1:11:06] for some it will be you're distracted by
[1:11:09] your failures.
[1:11:12] We could go into some natural things.
[1:11:14] There's men I won't go into specifics,
[1:11:16] but there's men who would be considered
[1:11:19] quite successful in this day had
[1:11:22] multiple failures in business.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. before they were ever
[1:11:26] successful. That's
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Dear old Colonel Sanders is one of them.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you looked at his life, you'd
[1:11:33] say this guy, as far as an entrepreneur,
[1:11:36] was a failure until by the time he
[1:11:39] passed away, he was giving away tens, if
[1:11:41] not hundreds of millions of dollars from
[1:11:44] his earnings from KFC.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; And that didn't happen until late in his
[1:11:49] life. So you look at this that what
[1:11:52] Satan cares about is getting you caught
[1:11:55] up in your failure.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; This is what I should have done. This is
[1:12:00] what I did wrong. And oh Lord, forgive
[1:12:03] me. I did this wrong. And you
[1:12:07] I I won't go there. But you'll be like
[1:12:09] some that will be back at your candle
[1:12:13] day after day asking forgiveness for the
[1:12:16] same thing again
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and again
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and again and again and again. Do you
[1:12:24] realize that when you are caught in that
[1:12:26] cycle that Satan has you distracted?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:12:32] sufficient.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is more than sufficient. He
[1:12:36] said, "My grace is sufficient." Can we
[1:12:39] say, "Amen, church?"
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. His grace is sufficient. Don't
[1:12:44] repent for what you've already repented
[1:12:46] for. You're pulling it out from
[1:12:48] underneath the blood and asking God to
[1:12:50] receive it again.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; It was already under the blood. Leave it
[1:12:55] under the blood.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:01] So it's there sometimes in our failure,
[1:13:04] Satan distracts us
[1:13:08] and sometimes it's in our success
[1:13:12] that he distracts us.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; I'm too busy.
[1:13:18] Now don't misunderstand me. I understand
[1:13:21] the things of life, the cares of life to
[1:13:23] earn a living for your family. And
[1:13:24] sometimes as it is, I know J brothers
[1:13:27] that work in factories
[1:13:29] and and that their shifts change every I
[1:13:33] don't know what it is. They have two
[1:13:34] weeks of days, two weeks of nights, uh a
[1:13:37] few days off. It shifts back to days and
[1:13:40] then nights and a few days off and and
[1:13:42] that's what their life is. And and
[1:13:44] that's how that works. And that's the
[1:13:46] employment in their area. So they're not
[1:13:49] making the choice to not be in church.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; It's a circumstance. Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But some
[1:13:57] could be in the house of God
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; and choose rather to go enjoy their
[1:14:02] success.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Outside of the house of God.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; If that hurts, I will pray for your
[1:14:11] wound.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; But you see, it's time for us to
[1:14:16] recognize sometimes our success is not
[1:14:18] God at all.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mr. Lucifer in his tuxedo and his
[1:14:25] success and driving his Bentley or
[1:14:27] Mercedes, you know, to come and look
[1:14:29] like this is what I want to be. Look at
[1:14:31] his life of ease. His life of ease.
[1:14:34] Everything has a cost.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; There is nothing on this earth that does
[1:14:38] not have a cost.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; What price will we pay?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes Satan, he uses these
[1:14:47] as distractions, our failure, our
[1:14:49] success, and we'll have a lot of
[1:14:51] whatifs. Now I I've looked back
[1:14:53] sometimes in my life and you know I get
[1:14:55] a little discouraged and I think you
[1:14:57] know if I'd have made this decision uh
[1:15:00] what if
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; am I alone?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; If I had just
[1:15:10] what if
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; but it's time for us to actually take
[1:15:16] that that distraction that Satan's
[1:15:18] using.
[1:15:20] Oh, let me just throw one at you here.
[1:15:23] You're sitting with someone says
[1:15:25] different country. I I need to talk to
[1:15:28] you.
[1:15:30] Okay.
[1:15:31] I've really been bothered lately,
[1:15:33] brother, about this thought that what if
[1:15:38] I hadn't married my wife and I'd married
[1:15:40] this sister?
[1:15:44] after I picked myself up off the floor.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[1:15:49] you're thinking three children 15 years
[1:15:53] later,
[1:15:55] your life would be better if you were
[1:15:57] married to this sister.
[1:16:01] Yeah, it's really bothering me.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; I feel like I missed something.
[1:16:08] Well, brother, let's just go back to the
[1:16:09] scripture.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's see what the scripture says.
[1:16:13] and I'm just going to paraphrase it.
[1:16:15] Don't despise the wife of your youth.
[1:16:17] And that's what you're doing.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; You're placing no value on her and this
[1:16:21] other one. But what he doesn't know is
[1:16:23] the brother that's married to this
[1:16:24] sister has come and said, "Ah, brother
[1:16:27] Paul, how do I deal with my wife's
[1:16:29] rebellious spirit."
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; So what he's wanting is to be married to
[1:16:34] this glamorous, very pretty sister. And
[1:16:38] if he had been married to her, he would
[1:16:40] be over here saying, "Minister, what do
[1:16:43] I do about her rebellious spirit?" See,
[1:16:46] Satan's a liar, a distraction. He's
[1:16:49] putting this out here, trying to pull
[1:16:51] you from where you're supposed to be to
[1:16:53] where you think you would be blessed at.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word says, "Amen." Oh, get
[1:17:00] ahead of yourself, Paul. Just a second,
[1:17:01] folks. I'll get there. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Look at the song that we that we sang
[1:17:06] here. I thought it was so beautiful.
[1:17:08] Amen. We have a lot of whatifs. And it's
[1:17:10] the nature of man to yearn for something
[1:17:14] more.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that something more is a
[1:17:18] figment of imagination.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; It is a figment. We have created an
[1:17:24] image.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. I I don't think this would
[1:17:29] be time or place to share what I
[1:17:30] consider is a funny story, but um you
[1:17:33] look at that. It's a nature of man to
[1:17:36] yearn. In the natural, men yearn, women
[1:17:40] too. They yearn
[1:17:43] and do not find.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; It leads people.
[1:17:48] If money was the answer to our problems,
[1:17:50] all the millionaires would be fabulously
[1:17:52] happy. But they kill themselves.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; They drink themselves to death. Amen.
[1:17:57] They're miserable creatures.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; So money is not the answer.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know by nature that our
[1:18:06] strength,
[1:18:10] it don't matter how many weights you
[1:18:12] lift, if you lift weights, I'm not
[1:18:14] preaching at you.
[1:18:16] It don't matter how many weights you
[1:18:17] lift,
[1:18:19] how defined your muscles are.
[1:18:23] When you get to a certain age,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; you fade away.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And as one brother put it one time,
[1:18:31] there was some young men in his church,
[1:18:33] got a real deal, joining the gym,
[1:18:35] pumping irons, starting to look really
[1:18:36] bulked up and and he preached really
[1:18:38] hard at that. Amen. He said, "I just
[1:18:40] want you to know when you guys get," and
[1:18:42] he named an age like 65 or something. He
[1:18:45] said, "All of that muscle is going to be
[1:18:47] down here and this skinny guy doesn't
[1:18:50] have anything to drop down there. So,
[1:18:52] you're actually worse off than he is.
[1:18:55] Amen. I thought, "Wow, is that blunt or
[1:18:57] not?" Amen. You guys are going to be the
[1:19:00] one that's going to be going to the skin
[1:19:02] doctor in secret with your hoodie on,
[1:19:04] going in there. Can you cut this all
[1:19:06] off? Can you get rid of all of No, my
[1:19:09] brother and sister. You see, it's all a
[1:19:11] distraction. It's all vanity. And what
[1:19:13] Satan's doing, he's trying to cause us
[1:19:15] not to be happy with who we are in Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ. Amen. God made you the way he
[1:19:22] made you. Amen. We should stand up and
[1:19:25] say, "Thank you, Lord." If I'm short,
[1:19:28] Amen. As one brother put it, I'm sorry
[1:19:30] to put it this way, offending nobody,
[1:19:32] but you know, he called them boxed
[1:19:34] squared. Amen. That's the one that's 4
[1:19:36] foot tall and 4 foot wide. If God made
[1:19:39] you box squared, be happy you're box
[1:19:42] square. If he made you seven feet tall,
[1:19:44] be happy you're seven feet tall. If he
[1:19:47] made you average, be happy you're
[1:19:50] average. If he made you super smart, be
[1:19:53] happy you're super smart.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be distracted of trying to
[1:19:58] be something else over here.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. If people on this earth caught
[1:20:02] that revelation, every makeup company on
[1:20:04] earth would be bankrupt overnight. But
[1:20:06] that distraction is I want to be pretty.
[1:20:10] I want to do this. I've got to do that.
[1:20:13] I need this. I need that so I can be
[1:20:16] pretty.
[1:20:19] But what's underneath?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; It's still you.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And you have to face you. Because no
[1:20:27] matter what, I know it sounds like I'm
[1:20:29] preaching to you sisters, but I'm not.
[1:20:30] I'm speaking a spiritual context. When
[1:20:33] the makeup comes off,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; it's still you.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; When the public image comes off,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; it's still you.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? Amen. I want the
[1:20:48] word that when everything comes off,
[1:20:51] they see the word. They see Christ in
[1:20:55] me.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Not a charade, not a fake, not an image
[1:21:00] that was crafted or created to present
[1:21:03] something,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; a distraction.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; In the natural,
[1:21:12] humanity yearns for and does not find
[1:21:18] Don't take this in a natural sense here,
[1:21:21] but do you realize research shows
[1:21:24] that as young people
[1:21:26] getting older,
[1:21:28] only 5 to 8%
[1:21:33] actually achieve what they dreamed of
[1:21:36] when they were young.
[1:21:53] Did they research and pull the bride of
[1:21:55] Christ when they did this research?
[1:22:01] I'll make a bold statement.
[1:22:04] 100%
[1:22:05] of the bride of Christ will be what God
[1:22:09] called them
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; to be.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Prophet shows us from the word that he
[1:22:16] will never leave us, never forsake us,
[1:22:19] that he will never walk away from us. My
[1:22:22] brother and sister, I can make that bold
[1:22:24] statement. 100% of the bride of Christ
[1:22:27] will be what they yearn for in their
[1:22:30] heart and soul. Does that mean that
[1:22:33] we'll never find ourselves wisfully
[1:22:35] thinking about this or wisfully thinking
[1:22:37] about that? No. That's your natural side
[1:22:40] coming out. But when we yield to the
[1:22:42] Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:22:45] says, "Look, I promise to lead you and
[1:22:47] guide you. We're going to make a hard
[1:22:49] right turn right here, even though it
[1:22:51] goes against everything you think. I'm
[1:22:53] going to cause a company to quit a
[1:22:55] division and lay you off to get you from
[1:22:58] being distracted about the big house,
[1:23:00] the car, the money, the clothes. Amen.
[1:23:02] I'm going to put you down into reality
[1:23:04] again. And we think, "Oh, Lord, what's
[1:23:07] happened? You forsook me." No, he's
[1:23:10] leading you. Amen. He's pulling you into
[1:23:13] his presence.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan was trying to distract
[1:23:17] us into these things. Praise God. The
[1:23:19] Lord loves me. I've got all this money,
[1:23:22] all these fine clothes, all of this.
[1:23:23] Praise God. No, we're taking a trip.
[1:23:26] We're I hope none of you are going here.
[1:23:29] No, I hope none of you are going to the
[1:23:30] south of Spain right now. Are you?
[1:23:34] We're We're going to go. We've rented a
[1:23:36] villa for three months in the south of
[1:23:38] Spain. Is there a church there?
[1:23:41] Fellowship there? No, but if we have
[1:23:44] time, we'll stream.
[1:23:50] That's it.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That little screen right there
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; has become
[1:23:56] your house of God.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody need a band-aid?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Look at this. What Satan's doing? He's
[1:24:07] got a substitute.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Don't forget forsake the assembling of
[1:24:12] yourselves.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Well, we are. I mean, it's just through
[1:24:16] technology.
[1:24:18] I'll tell you, can I can I just waste a
[1:24:20] minute of your time? Sister Jerry and I
[1:24:22] in our vacationing, we have been places
[1:24:25] and sat in a service
[1:24:27] and so tremendously blessed.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, just above and beyond blessed by
[1:24:34] that service. Actually, Sister Jerry and
[1:24:36] I was going through kind of a hard time
[1:24:38] in life. A few hard decisions we had to
[1:24:40] make and whatever it was. and we're
[1:24:43] sitting there and it was though the
[1:24:45] minister
[1:24:47] had the diary of our thoughts.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And he preached it right down the line.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Couldn't deny it. Not one fraction.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; We got home from our trip. Has that
[1:24:59] happened to anybody?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got home from our trip and
[1:25:02] we're like, "That was such a good
[1:25:03] service. Let's watch it again." And
[1:25:05] we're sitting there watching the
[1:25:06] service. No popcorn, no bunny slippers,
[1:25:09] no recliners. We are paying attention.
[1:25:12] and we just looked at each other and
[1:25:13] it's like, it's not the same.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It's not the same. We're We were there.
[1:25:20] We know how the Holy Spirit just moved
[1:25:22] down through that church, how the Holy
[1:25:24] Spirit spoke to us and we're watching it
[1:25:27] on a screen and it's just not there.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not to say God won't deal
[1:25:32] with you.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; But to understand a firsthand
[1:25:35] experience,
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; that's it. And I wouldn't call it
[1:25:38] secondhand experience, but
[1:25:42] the substitute.
[1:25:45] Are we all right? I didn't offend
[1:25:46] anybody.
[1:25:48] It's not my intention today.
[1:25:51] Maybe next Sunday, but not this Sunday.
[1:25:57] 5 to 8% achieve their dreams.
[1:26:02] Some go to alcohol and drugs,
[1:26:05] infidelities, and all kinds of things
[1:26:07] trying to find what it is. You know,
[1:26:09] I've used that simple analogy to you,
[1:26:11] church, before. They've proven that the
[1:26:14] first three bites of ice cream is as
[1:26:16] much flavor and stimulation as your body
[1:26:18] will get from eating that whole gallon.
[1:26:21] I didn't like that research.
[1:26:24] I still found joy in eating the whole
[1:26:27] bowl. But the stimulation from it,
[1:26:32] see, Satan wants to stimulate you. I
[1:26:36] don't know. Have any of you had too much
[1:26:38] interaction with drug addicts
[1:26:43] in life? I've had a reasonable amount of
[1:26:46] interaction with drug addicts.
[1:26:50] And you know what they search for? Meth
[1:26:51] is. Meth is a just incredible
[1:26:54] destructive thing.
[1:26:56] You know what they're searching for?
[1:26:59] Desire for more meth.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Desire to relive the first
[1:27:08] stimulant
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; of meth
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; that they ever had.
[1:27:14] That's what they're pursuing.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:20] And they can achieve it in a mild form
[1:27:22] by taking more, more, more, more, more.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see a parallel?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; There's a positive parallel hid in
[1:27:32] there.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:27:37] want an upper room experience,
[1:27:40] get more of Jesus. Yeah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; It's the only way you're ever going to
[1:27:43] come back to an upper room experience
[1:27:47] again.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Not a substitute.
[1:27:52] You see how Satan's so clever?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; He latches on to the things that God
[1:27:56] has.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; The song we sing, more of you.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I had it all.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But what I need,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Is more of you.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:10] See how God is working, my brother and
[1:28:11] sister. Satan's got his distractions
[1:28:13] that he puts out here. And speaking of
[1:28:16] that, I'm distracted right now.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; See, it's there. I even took and opened
[1:28:22] my iPad as as brother Isaac was singing
[1:28:24] that and typed right in the line there
[1:28:26] with a big arrow, more of you. See, this
[1:28:28] is similar in the spiritual.
[1:28:32] Many people, maybe some even sitting
[1:28:34] here this morning would say, "I have not
[1:28:36] achieved the spiritual goals that I
[1:28:38] thought I would achieve in my life. The
[1:28:40] spiritual position, I have not achieve
[1:28:43] that. I I don't feel like I'm any
[1:28:44] close." You know, you might say, you
[1:28:46] know, we should I hear preachers say,
[1:28:47] "We should be ready for the rapture
[1:28:49] right now." But I want to ask the
[1:28:51] preacher, are you ready for the rapture?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; It's easy for me to say you should be
[1:28:57] ready for the rapture. But if we had a
[1:28:59] little truth serum, which the Holy
[1:29:01] Spirit is, it'll come down. Not one of
[1:29:03] us feel like we're ready for a rapture.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; But there's a yearning.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; There is something inside of us that
[1:29:12] says, "Lord, I want to be ready for the
[1:29:13] rapture. I'm not quitting. I'm not going
[1:29:16] to stop. I'm not going to fall short of
[1:29:18] the goal. I want to be ready for the
[1:29:20] rapture." And yet then we face things in
[1:29:23] our life and we say, "Oh Lord, I've come
[1:29:26] short of the glory of God. What do I do,
[1:29:29] Lord?" And we think that we're not
[1:29:32] spiritual.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to see what Satan's doing
[1:29:36] here.
[1:29:37] When you come to the place that you feel
[1:29:39] like you've fallen short and you cannot
[1:29:41] reach the expectation of your life,
[1:29:44] amen, that disappointment diminishes
[1:29:48] your vision
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; of your calling.
[1:29:54] Do you realize at a time when brother
[1:29:57] Brandon was preaching back east,
[1:30:00] there was interaction between men
[1:30:04] and men who had been at one time
[1:30:07] wealthy men
[1:30:11] and because of disappointments in their
[1:30:12] life, they gave up and went abandoned
[1:30:17] families, children's nice homes,
[1:30:20] financials and ended up living on the
[1:30:22] street. And they asked him why.
[1:30:26] And their answer was because I'm a
[1:30:28] failure.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; You realize what Satan's trying to do to
[1:30:34] you today, saints? He's trying to
[1:30:36] convince you you're a failure.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; You fell short of the glory of God. Oh,
[1:30:41] you fell short again. Oh, you fell short
[1:30:43] again. You're a failure. What he's
[1:30:45] trying to do is cause you to give up and
[1:30:49] lower your expectation. I I do go to
[1:30:51] church and I read my Bible last month.
[1:30:57] Lowered expectations.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; The disappointment diminishes the vision
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; until the vision fades and it's man. You
[1:31:11] know what happens? I'm not preaching too
[1:31:13] hard this morning, am I?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You know what happens? Humanity settles
[1:31:19] for what they think they can do.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe the Lord would have his
[1:31:30] hand in this, but there's many, many,
[1:31:32] many, many recorded times.
[1:31:35] Young man's working on a car in the
[1:31:37] driveway. It falls off the jack and his
[1:31:41] friend is pinned under the car.
[1:31:44] That young man who is no way he could
[1:31:46] lift a 2,000lb car goes over there and
[1:31:49] grabs a bumper and lifts that car.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Could he repeat that?
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; At the time that he's doing that, he's
[1:32:03] not thinking about
[1:32:05] the car is a whatever model
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; weighs 2364 lbs with no gas. It's got a
[1:32:11] full tank.
[1:32:13] I can't lift that.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; No, sir. It was life and death.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; And something inside of him.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, my brother and sister. This is
[1:32:21] life and death.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to say, you know what,
[1:32:25] Lord? You called me to this. You
[1:32:28] ordained me to this. I am a son of God.
[1:32:31] I am a daughter of God. I can overcome
[1:32:34] Leodysia.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. without stopping to think of all
[1:32:38] the sin and unbelief and all the
[1:32:40] circumstances of the world. And as the
[1:32:42] prophet of God says, the nuclear bombs,
[1:32:44] people were terrified. The nuclear bombs
[1:32:46] were hanging.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; And people were like, "Oh, we lost
[1:32:51] hope." My brother and sister, the bride
[1:32:53] of Jesus Christ, Amen. I'm sorry this a
[1:32:56] little personal to some here. This
[1:32:58] conflict that's over there between
[1:33:00] Russia and these different countries,
[1:33:01] Ukraine, etc. My brother and sister, it
[1:33:04] never happened without God allowing it
[1:33:06] to happen. Amen. We don't need to be
[1:33:08] terrified. Oh, what's happening? What's
[1:33:10] Oh, this is horrible. Lives are lost. My
[1:33:13] brother and sister, my God is in
[1:33:16] control. Until we can trust God that he
[1:33:19] truly is 100% in control. I've got a
[1:33:22] child not serving God. Oh, woe unto me.
[1:33:25] God's in control. My company's shutting
[1:33:28] down. What am I going to God's in
[1:33:30] control? I've been diagnosed with this
[1:33:33] disease. My God is in control. Amen. And
[1:33:37] when you don't trust God that much, you
[1:33:40] might as well not trust him at all.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz one little bit of unbelief and
[1:33:44] doubt,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; negates everything else.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; So they settle for what they can do. I
[1:33:52] can only have this much happiness
[1:33:54] serving God.
[1:33:59] I'm just so concerned
[1:34:01] what I'll have to give up.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; To serve him.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you who placed value on
[1:34:08] what you were giving up.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I know a young man in South America
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; went off to university, backslid.
[1:34:20] Young lady there in the university set
[1:34:22] his cap for him. We're not talking about
[1:34:24] some ugly young lady. A beautiful young
[1:34:28] lady
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; decided this is the man for me.
[1:34:35] Compromised here, compromised there.
[1:34:38] Didn't want to lose her. I mean, after
[1:34:40] all, what young man wouldn't want a
[1:34:43] beautiful girlfriend?
[1:34:47] But God got a hold of his heart.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; God dealt with him. And this is his own
[1:34:52] testimony to me. What I placed so much
[1:34:56] value on one trip to the altar, brother
[1:35:00] Paul.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And I got up from there and I saw no
[1:35:05] value.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Look at the change that God did in that
[1:35:09] man's life.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he's doing in every
[1:35:12] one of our life. We place so much value
[1:35:14] on this and we get one experience of
[1:35:17] coming in the presence of almighty God
[1:35:19] and our value system changes. Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And suddenly
[1:35:26] he he's like, "What?" I'll tell you,
[1:35:27] it's a beautiful story. Amen. Young
[1:35:31] woman in the church, young sister in the
[1:35:33] church, very beautiful. Now, I'm not
[1:35:36] saying that the beauty part is it. But
[1:35:38] interesting how God did this. Here's
[1:35:40] this young girl, just a lovely Christian
[1:35:43] girl, sincere, faithful. Amen. Do
[1:35:46] everything she could to help serve God.
[1:35:48] and in the context of helping in the
[1:35:50] church also. And uh
[1:35:53] he goes on, the Lord got a hold of his
[1:35:56] life, he gets an education,
[1:35:58] gets a good job.
[1:36:00] And one day they're at a fellowship
[1:36:02] thing for the youth and
[1:36:04] this girl's there and he looks over
[1:36:08] and he says, "How come I never noticed
[1:36:12] her before?"
[1:36:17] Bing.
[1:36:19] I'm in love.
[1:36:22] Now I want to ask you saints. I know
[1:36:23] this a little direct.
[1:36:26] What kind of love would he have got
[1:36:27] here?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Compared to the kind of love God had in
[1:36:32] store for him.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only did he get a beautiful
[1:36:37] girl, smart girl, determined girl, a
[1:36:40] good wife, a good mother, she loves God
[1:36:43] with all of her heart.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which one was the real prize?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; I can only have this much happiness.
[1:36:52] I can only have this much joy in my
[1:36:54] salvation
[1:36:56] because I have this issue and this issue
[1:36:58] and this issue, this issue. I thought we
[1:37:01] had put those under the blood.
[1:37:06] What sin?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Are you talking about?
[1:37:11] I I forget the words.
[1:37:15] How's that go, Sister Jerry?
[1:37:18] I don't remember. What sin are you
[1:37:20] talking about? I don't remember them
[1:37:22] anymore.
[1:37:24] So, we're sitting over here, if you
[1:37:25] don't mind me. We're sitting over here
[1:37:30] and I told this lie.
[1:37:32] I got drunk.
[1:37:35] I did this. I did that. I stole.
[1:37:39] Why would God love me?
[1:37:42] What? Sin. That's right.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Are you talking about
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; don't remember anymore.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; But you see what Satan's done?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; He threw this big
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; You know what these parking bumpers are
[1:37:59] for? For those of you who don't know
[1:38:01] where the front wheels of your car are
[1:38:02] at, that's what they're actually for.
[1:38:05] But you see, you're going to damage your
[1:38:08] car if you drive over the parking
[1:38:09] bumper, right?
[1:38:16] You did this.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You can't go any further.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; You live right. You read your Bible. You
[1:38:24] pray. You go to church. You do all these
[1:38:27] things. You can't go. You come up.
[1:38:33] It's cuz I'm not worthy.
[1:38:37] That's why God's not happy with me.
[1:38:40] I'm not worthy.
[1:38:42] Well, what you got to do is recognize
[1:38:44] God didn't put that in front of you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; That came from Satan.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize that, I know my
[1:38:52] brother and sister, it's just
[1:38:53] supernatural, but that parking bumper
[1:38:57] disappears out of your life.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's there no longer.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; I can only have this much happiness. The
[1:39:06] joy of my salvation is lacking.
[1:39:08] You know why it's lacking? Because you
[1:39:11] haven't received the giver of joy
[1:39:15] completely.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You say you believe him. You declare you
[1:39:19] believe him. You sometimes actually act
[1:39:21] on the fact that you believe him. And
[1:39:23] then you allow Satan to come in and
[1:39:26] distract you.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; With you.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; It's you he's using to distract you.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's you he uses as a tool to keep
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; from getting closer to him.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I I need to I need to I need to go
[1:39:49] uh we'll just take this in in in
[1:39:52] ministry form here. Joshua 1:es 2:7.
[1:39:55] Now, what happens here? God doesn't come
[1:39:59] to Joshua and say, "Now Joshua, Moses,
[1:40:02] my servant, is dead." And uh now I need
[1:40:05] you to hunker down and build a defensive
[1:40:07] ring about the revelation that I
[1:40:09] brought. Now there's a promised land,
[1:40:11] but that promise is figurative. That
[1:40:13] promise was a kind of an intellectual
[1:40:15] promise. That's an emotional promise.
[1:40:17] That's this and that's that. No. What
[1:40:19] does God do? He comes to Joshua and he
[1:40:21] tells Joshua, "You know what? It's time
[1:40:22] for you to rise up."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. My servant Moses is dead. But my
[1:40:28] servant, you put your name in here. But
[1:40:31] my servant, Come on, put your name in
[1:40:33] there. My servant, Amen. It's time for
[1:40:36] my servant to rise up and possess the
[1:40:39] land.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's not for us to say, "But brother
[1:40:41] Brandham passed away. A prophet to the
[1:40:43] age is gone." No. That's because my
[1:40:45] brother and sister, God said, "It's time
[1:40:47] for you to rise up."
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He don't need, now pardon me. Some
[1:40:53] people be offended at me saying this. We
[1:40:54] don't need a prophet to rise up again.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has come. And the word
[1:40:59] has come for you and I to come in our
[1:41:02] season in the revelation of the word in
[1:41:05] this time, in our need. And for you and
[1:41:08] I not to sit here and say, "But we were
[1:41:10] promised a word that would restore the
[1:41:12] church and bring these things back in
[1:41:14] order." My brother and sister, it's
[1:41:16] there. It's happened. Rise up and
[1:41:19] possess it.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you just sit there and say,
[1:41:22] "But he promised. But he promised.
[1:41:24] Somebody promised that won't do you a
[1:41:26] single thing.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a little story
[1:41:29] about the the lady that was in dire
[1:41:31] need, the grandmother in dire need. And
[1:41:33] and they they come and they're like,
[1:41:35] "Oh, but what about your son?" "Oh, I
[1:41:37] have such a lovely son. He's over there
[1:41:39] doing this work and doing these things.
[1:41:41] Does he contact you?" Yes, he sends me
[1:41:43] letters and all of this stuff, but I
[1:41:45] have no money and and blah blah blah.
[1:41:47] And you know what was there, my brother
[1:41:49] and sister, is when they opened those
[1:41:51] letters and said, "Can we read those
[1:41:52] letters?" and they opened it and there
[1:41:54] was money order after money order after
[1:41:56] money order after money order. She was
[1:41:59] actually, you might say, wealthy. Amen.
[1:42:01] But she didn't have the revelation.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; To catch the promise.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's it right there.
[1:42:08] That's it.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; this love letter,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; that's it,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; that's been written to you,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Have you looked all the way through it?
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe it's just tucked away on the
[1:42:20] next page. In the next fold of it, give
[1:42:23] you a little silly example. I have my
[1:42:26] little favorite song cheat sheet. Yes,
[1:42:29] I'm sorry. I cheat.
[1:42:31] Sometimes I have inspiration. You know,
[1:42:33] it's like, what's that song? What's that
[1:42:35] song? What's that song? Huh? I can't
[1:42:36] remember that song. What do I do while
[1:42:39] you guys are all preoccupied? I open my
[1:42:41] Bible.
[1:42:44] Oh, there it is.
[1:42:47] Come on.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Open the love letter.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Inside of it's everything you need.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and say, "We're starving.
[1:42:58] Seems like the message has come short in
[1:43:00] my life." No, I'll tell you what came
[1:43:02] short. Forgive me if it's too blunt. You
[1:43:04] came short.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You never opened the love letter.
[1:43:08] You never searched through it. It might
[1:43:09] have just been on the next page. Turned
[1:43:11] out to be a money order. All these
[1:43:13] little things with all the pretty
[1:43:15] pictures.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham told these sis
[1:43:19] lovely little stories. They're they're
[1:43:21] just so cute. Really?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister was a spiritual
[1:43:27] money order.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; That he gave us.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Let me move on here. Amen. See this
[1:43:34] promise uh here in Joshua 2 or I mean
[1:43:38] one verse two going on down. Amen. It
[1:43:41] lays it out and he tells them, "You know
[1:43:43] what? You need to be strong and
[1:43:44] courageous. You can observe to do
[1:43:46] according to all the law." Amen. That
[1:43:49] you were commanded by the prophet of
[1:43:51] your day
[1:43:53] to do.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Turn not from it to the right or the
[1:43:57] left
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; that thou mayest prosper whethersoever
[1:44:01] thou goest.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Let me just cut this short so I don't
[1:44:06] drag this out. You've got to allow
[1:44:09] yourself
[1:44:12] to be complete.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; In him,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; If you continue to remind yourself of
[1:44:19] your own self,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; you'll never move any farther
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; than yourself.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; And I didn't say it that way to be cute.
[1:44:28] I'm telling you, it's not even the devil
[1:44:31] that's hindering you.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; It's his influence on you that hinders
[1:44:36] you.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So when you cut off
[1:44:38] the influence, you'll realize God made a
[1:44:41] promise to you. He'll keep that promise.
[1:44:44] Amen. Allow yourself, no matter where
[1:44:47] you're at. I love this little story was
[1:44:50] shared to me. My it's probably been 20
[1:44:52] years plus ago. I met a brother back
[1:44:55] east. Won't be too specific. Um met a
[1:44:58] brother back east. We're talking. I
[1:45:00] really like I enjoyed talking to him and
[1:45:03] uh we just chatting away about the word
[1:45:06] and he's just enthusiastic and you know
[1:45:09] I was just like wow this is an awesome
[1:45:10] brother. Then another brother who's my
[1:45:12] friend also, he goes, "Do you know that
[1:45:15] brother?" And I said, "No, just met
[1:45:16] him." It's wonderful conversation. He
[1:45:19] said, "Um, you know, he was raised in
[1:45:21] the message." I was like, "Oh, cuz he
[1:45:24] said, you know, I've only been serving
[1:45:26] the Lord for I forget it was like seven
[1:45:28] years or nine years or something. He was
[1:45:30] raised in the message."
[1:45:33] Oh, okay.
[1:45:36] Yeah. I got to hanging out with the
[1:45:37] wrong people. backslid when he was about
[1:45:40] 19,
[1:45:42] went out, just went crazy.
[1:45:46] Now, this brother wasn't being negative.
[1:45:48] He had he had a little something to
[1:45:50] share. Just went crazy.
[1:45:53] And one day,
[1:45:55] he's sitting in a barroom
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; with his elbows
[1:46:01] on the counter holding a beer.
[1:46:06] And a friend
[1:46:10] was talking to another friend
[1:46:13] and said, "Can you believe them
[1:46:14] Brandommites over there in that church?
[1:46:17] Bunch of hypocrites. Got their wives all
[1:46:20] trusted up like they're do and they they
[1:46:22] won't do this and they want that. They
[1:46:24] they don't drink, they don't do that,
[1:46:25] they don't music, they don't do nothing.
[1:46:27] They're just a bunch of hypocrites.
[1:46:31] How dare you talk about them like that?"
[1:46:34] That's right.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; You don't even know them. I know them.
[1:46:38] They're real Christians.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Then he's like, "What did I just say?"
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And he storms out of that barroom and he
[1:46:48] goes home.
[1:46:50] Did I really say that? Yeah, I did. Cuz
[1:46:54] it's true.
[1:46:56] And he come back and he gave his heart
[1:46:57] to the Lord. Oh, it'd be okay, my
[1:47:00] brother and sister, if they came out of
[1:47:02] the world through the barroom to the
[1:47:04] church. But when they left the church
[1:47:05] and went to the barroom,
[1:47:07] people are like, "Well, we don't know if
[1:47:09] it's going to last."
[1:47:11] After all, what took him there in the
[1:47:13] beginning might take him back.
[1:47:17] Get thee behind me, Satan.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; This is a son of God. This is a daughter
[1:47:27] of God. Amen. And this is the word of
[1:47:30] God calling those back because they must
[1:47:34] be complete
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Serve God for 40 years or serve God for
[1:47:40] five days. My brother and sister, God
[1:47:42] doesn't care. He knows the work he's
[1:47:44] done in them. An 11th hour worker is
[1:47:46] going to get the same exact reward.
[1:47:48] Forget about your seniority and how long
[1:47:51] you've done and who you know. Amen. Get
[1:47:54] to know him. become complete in him.
[1:47:58] There's the answer.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He Now look, Philippians 1:6.
[1:48:04] Amen. Being confident of this very
[1:48:06] thing, that he which hath begun a good
[1:48:08] work in you will perform it until the
[1:48:11] day of Jesus Christ. Look, I'm going to
[1:48:13] just take this here in the scripture.
[1:48:15] That's a small H, but my brother and
[1:48:17] sister, we're going to emphasize it.
[1:48:19] That should be a large H. Amen. Amen. Be
[1:48:22] confident in the very thing that he
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; which began the work. Did it say you?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say you that began the work.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; It says he began the work. Amen. In Oh,
[1:48:36] here it is. The work is on you.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Next to you
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; in your church.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; No, it's in you.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And will continue.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We could stop right there. It's
[1:48:50] going to continue. until the rapture.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; It's going to continue till God has
[1:48:56] perfected and molded you into this
[1:48:59] perfect image of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, Satan, we're
[1:49:04] putting you on notice today. Amen. We're
[1:49:07] not here to hear about what you've got
[1:49:09] to say. We'll never be complete in you,
[1:49:12] Satan. We'll be complete and already are
[1:49:15] in Jesus Christ.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; There's where we were called to be
[1:49:19] complete. Right.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't something did. It was
[1:49:24] something that took place in us.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, the tent vision. I'm sorry.
[1:49:29] I'm getting all excited here. The tent
[1:49:31] vision, those people come in there and
[1:49:33] they went into that tent and when they
[1:49:35] come out the other side, people were
[1:49:37] there. What happened in there?
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; You'll notice they didn't say nothing.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:45] What they did is they come out and said,
[1:49:48] "I don't know."
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, you've received the
[1:49:52] Holy Ghost.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; How did that happen?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Did you set this little block here and
[1:49:59] put this here?
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; As one man, this happened in South
[1:50:04] Africa. Sorry, I don't want to sound
[1:50:05] disrespectful. They're a little more
[1:50:07] formal than we are. Well, some of you
[1:50:10] are kind of formal. Some of us are very
[1:50:11] much redneck. Fork in this hand, knife
[1:50:14] in this hand. We're ready. Let's eat.
[1:50:18] I was joking with a brother and he goes,
[1:50:21] "Well, brother Paul, you guys just don't
[1:50:22] understand some of the little finer
[1:50:24] things." And I couldn't help but retort
[1:50:27] and say, "Brother, I want to know. The
[1:50:29] silverware lined up perfectly. Did it
[1:50:32] make the meal taste any better?"
[1:50:36] He just looked at me and said, "You got
[1:50:37] a point there.
[1:50:39] We're going to do it anyhow, though.
[1:50:42] Now, I want you to understand
[1:50:45] God set it in order.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, I got revelation, but I
[1:50:52] went I got it another way."
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:50:57] God's got order.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; He puts things in order.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, he sure does.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Now, that analogy might be a poor one. I
[1:51:04] went ahead and
[1:51:07] It's funny. Brings up a memory. So, this
[1:51:10] is how I I I I like to saw. The sharper
[1:51:15] the knife, the less I look embarrassing,
[1:51:17] but I like to saw with my right hand.
[1:51:19] More strength, precision. And I like to
[1:51:22] spear it with a fork with my left hand.
[1:51:27] And then when I go to eat it, I'm not
[1:51:30] very good with my left hand, so I trade
[1:51:33] silverware.
[1:51:35] And the brother's like, "Where did you
[1:51:37] learn that? Yeah.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Brother, you mean they
[1:51:42] actually teach that?"
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Just watch us eat, Brother Paul,
[1:51:49] and you'll understand.
[1:51:51] And I watched them eat, and I thought,
[1:51:54] "Huh?" Still don't get it.
[1:52:00] My brother and sister, God wants you to
[1:52:02] come. Formality won't make this word
[1:52:05] taste any better.
[1:52:08] But understanding that God called you.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he presented himself. Not we
[1:52:14] we can go we can get into remma and all
[1:52:16] these different words and put it. Let's
[1:52:18] just cut it down to simplicity. Paul's
[1:52:19] level. Amen. When God come to you, he
[1:52:22] didn't come to you say, "I'm going to
[1:52:23] come to you in a formality. I'm going to
[1:52:26] come to you personally."
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to present myself personally.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; I think formal is good. I remember I
[1:52:35] dressed up formal one time.
[1:52:39] You notice I said one
[1:52:42] because I noticed that in this formal
[1:52:44] environment I didn't belong there.
[1:52:48] You can come formal
[1:52:51] and you can say we've got it. We're
[1:52:54] sophisticated believers.
[1:52:57] But I want to know are you complete in
[1:52:59] him?
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; There is the difference.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ruth, would you come?
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got more to preach here, but we
[1:53:11] just need to go on.
[1:53:15] Now, remember, let me just share this
[1:53:17] one little story here. Remember, Brother
[1:53:20] Brown tells a story about the man
[1:53:23] that uh picked up a little flyer, a
[1:53:25] little pamphlet, and it was asking him
[1:53:28] about his eternal destination,
[1:53:31] the Holy Ghost. and something inside of
[1:53:34] the man just kind of a pang and he's
[1:53:38] like I want the Holy Ghost
[1:53:40] and he went over to this church and they
[1:53:44] shouted said you got it but he didn't
[1:53:47] feel anything he went over here went
[1:53:50] over here went over here went over here
[1:53:52] very dissatisfied
[1:53:55] didn't feel complete
[1:53:58] and a friend of his told him well the
[1:54:00] evangelist
[1:54:02] William Brandham's going to be over
[1:54:04] here. Maybe go over there.
[1:54:08] Now, you know the story, right?
[1:54:11] H
[1:54:13] a lot of blank kind of faces, but I'm
[1:54:15] going to interpret that that's a yes.
[1:54:18] Comes to brother Brandham
[1:54:21] says, "I want the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:54:24] seeking the Holy Ghost. I've been here.
[1:54:26] I've been baptized face forward,
[1:54:28] backwards, this, that. I've shouted.
[1:54:30] I've spoke in tongues. I've done all of
[1:54:32] these things and something's missing.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham didn't set him
[1:54:38] down and start in the front of the Bible
[1:54:40] and start working his way through it.
[1:54:42] Now, take this and take that and do this
[1:54:44] and do that. Put it Brother asked him
[1:54:47] one question.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; When you read that pamphlet, that flyer,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; what happened?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:54:59] He said, "There was something
[1:55:02] down in my heart."
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Said, "I must have this."
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; And Brother Brandon gave him 12 pages
[1:55:13] double spaced.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Go do this. Go do that. Oh, am I reading
[1:55:18] the wrong quote?
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you are.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "That's when the Holy Spirit
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; came to you." That's right,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; my brother and sister.
[1:55:30] Don't let the devil
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; keep having you chase your tail.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Keep you running through the brush
[1:55:38] trying to find it.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Just settle down. Know that God called
[1:55:42] you.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; He's opened his word to you. Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; The very life of Christ is being
[1:55:47] manifested in you.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just settle down. Good days. I
[1:55:52] love Brother Isaac how he brought that
[1:55:53] out. Yeah. of those bad days. Well, I
[1:55:56] start out there are the bad days. Thank
[1:55:57] you for that.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; because you see, I don't know about you
[1:56:02] guys. I could pull my sleeve up and show
[1:56:05] you where I just ripped the pardon my
[1:56:09] Idaho English. I just ripped the tar out
[1:56:11] of my left arm. I come home that day
[1:56:14] literally had blood streaks running down
[1:56:16] my arm where it ran down my arm and
[1:56:18] dripped off of my fingers.
[1:56:23] Good day or bad day.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; My flesh said bad day.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God had told me that
[1:56:33] day that I was elect,
[1:56:36] I was chosen.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And I said amen to that. And I could say
[1:56:42] in spite of this,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; It was a good day.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't look at your flesh.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't look at your
[1:56:50] circumstance. Look at this promise. If
[1:56:53] you want to settle down here, I don't
[1:56:56] know how many of you want to keep
[1:56:57] cattle. But if you want to settle down
[1:56:58] here and raise cattle, get across that
[1:57:00] river, claim your promise, and then you
[1:57:03] can come back and own any kind of
[1:57:04] company and any size of house and any
[1:57:06] kind of car you want. But make sure you
[1:57:08] got across the river and come back to
[1:57:12] claim it. Don't settle for having it
[1:57:15] here and say, "God blessed me. This is
[1:57:17] from the Lord." But you don't have the
[1:57:20] promise. Amen. I need to stop. Amen.
[1:57:24] Because if we enter part two, we're in
[1:57:27] trouble. Hallelujah.
[1:57:29] Amen. I got some beautiful quotes here.
[1:57:32] I'll just have to share them another
[1:57:33] day. Amen. I'll just let you guys wonder
[1:57:36] about them. Amen. For a day or two.
[1:57:39] Let's just stand. Sing that little song.
[1:57:42] It is so sweet to trust in Jesus.
[1:57:45] Amen.
[1:57:46] Hallelujah.
[1:57:51] Tears so sweet
[1:57:55] to trust in Jesus.
[1:58:00] Just to take
[1:58:03] him at his word,
[1:58:08] just
[1:58:10] to rest
[1:58:12] upon his promise.
[1:58:16] us to know.
[1:58:20] Thus saith the Lord
[1:58:24] Jesus.
[1:58:26] Jesus,
[1:58:28] how I trust him, how I prove
[1:58:36] him all and all.
[1:58:40] Jesus,
[1:58:42] Jesus,
[1:58:44] preious
[1:58:46] Jesus.
[1:58:48] Oh, for grace
[1:58:52] to trust. Lord, give us more grace to
[1:58:54] trust you.
[1:58:56] Oh, how sweet
[1:59:00] to trust in Jesus.
[1:59:04] Just in sense
[1:59:08] is cleansing
[1:59:10] blood.
[1:59:12] Just in simple
[1:59:16] faith to plunge
[1:59:20] meet the healing
[1:59:24] cleansing
[1:59:26] flow.
[1:59:28] Jesus.
[1:59:30] Jesus.
[1:59:32] How I trust him. How I've proved
[1:59:39] him more and more.
[1:59:44] Jesus.
[1:59:45] Jesus.
[1:59:47] Precious
[1:59:49] Jesus.
[1:59:52] Oh, for grace
[1:59:55] to trust him more.
[1:59:59] Yes, is sweet
[2:00:03] to trust in Jesus.
[2:00:07] Just from sin
[2:00:10] and self to see
[2:00:15] just from Jesus.
[2:00:19] simply
[2:00:21] taking
[2:00:23] life and rest
[2:00:26] and joy and peace.
[2:00:30] Jesus,
[2:00:32] Jesus,
[2:00:34] how I trust him. How I prove
[2:00:42] him and know.
[2:00:46] Jesus.
[2:00:48] Jesus,
[2:00:50] preious
[2:00:51] Jesus.
[2:00:54] Oh, for grace to trust him more.
[2:01:01] I'm so glad
[2:01:05] I learned to trust thee, preious Jesus,
[2:01:13] Savior,
[2:01:15] friend.
[2:01:17] And I know that thou art with me with
[2:01:32] Jesus.
[2:01:34] Jesus,
[2:01:35] how I trust him, how I prove
[2:01:42] him more and more
[2:01:47] Jesus.
[2:01:49] Jesus,
[2:01:50] preious
[2:01:52] Jesus,
[2:01:54] oh for grace
[2:01:57] to trust him more.
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:03] Amen. Amen. Brother Paul hit it on a
[2:02:05] couple times there, but on that uh
[2:02:10] that verse, sorry, it's a second verse
[2:02:13] there. Just to trust his cleansing
[2:02:14] blood. You know,
[2:02:19] in my own life, how many times this
[2:02:22] devil's come in there and said, you
[2:02:24] know, you you need to go make this
[2:02:26] right. And I'm thinking, I already made
[2:02:27] that right. Whatever it is, you know,
[2:02:30] I've I've repented for that. He's trying
[2:02:32] to make you not trust that cleansing
[2:02:34] blood.
[2:02:36] His word says
[2:02:38] when that blood was shed,
[2:02:41] when you accept that blood, when you've
[2:02:44] committed that unto him, it's done.
[2:02:47] Praise God. It's done.
[2:02:51] Hallelujah. Thank you. Thank you, Lord
[2:02:53] Jesus.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; And when you tell the devil that he's
[2:03:00] got to get behind you,

[2:05:48] him, it's not us anymore anyways. Amen.

[2:05:55] Sa Satan's like a roaring lion roaming
[2:06:01] to and fro
[2:06:04] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[2:06:10] tells me so.
[2:06:13] These souls have been his prey to fall
[2:06:18] in some weak hour.
[2:06:21] But God has given us today his
[2:06:26] overcoming
[2:06:28] power.
[2:06:30] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:06:34] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:06:38] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:06:43] is in the world.
[2:06:46] On the day of Pentecost,
[2:06:50] rushing mighty wind
[2:06:54] blew into the upper room, baptized all
[2:07:00] of them
[2:07:03] with a power greater than
[2:07:07] any earthly foe.
[2:07:11] And I'm so glad I got it, too. who I'm
[2:07:15] going to let the whole world know.
[2:07:19] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:07:23] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:07:27] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:07:32] is in the world.
[2:07:35] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:07:40] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:07:44] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:07:48] is in the world.
[2:07:52] Praise the Lord. Amen. That's right.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. One more as we get ready to
[2:08:01] dismiss here. Um
[2:08:03] listen to our hearts.
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:15] Amen. Amen. I love the Lord.
[2:08:22] How do you explain?
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:28] How do you describe
[2:08:34] a love that goes from east to west?
[2:08:39] runs as deep as it is wide.
[2:08:45] You know all our hopes.
[2:08:50] Lord, you know all our fears.
[2:08:56] When words could not express the love we
[2:09:00] feel, but we long for you to hear.
[2:09:07] Listen to our heart.
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] Hear our spirit sing.

[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:22] from those you have redeemed.
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:27] And we will use the words we know to
[2:09:32] tell you what an awesome God you are.
[2:09:38] When words are not enough to tell you of
[2:09:42] our love, just listen to our heart.
[2:09:49] If words could fall like rain
[2:09:55] from these lips of mine.
[2:10:00] If I had a thousand years,
[2:10:05] I would still run out of time.
[2:10:10] So if you listen to my heart,
[2:10:17] every beat will say,
[2:10:22] "Thank you for the life. Thank you for
[2:10:25] the truth. Thank you for the way.
[2:10:32] into our hearts.

[2:11:07] our love, just listen to our heart.
