[25:20] welcome home god bless you each and
[25:22] every one of you tonight

[25:35] fiance
[25:37] uh brother yannick has made it to the
[25:40] states and uh

[25:44] answer to prayer
[25:45] we still have other needs when it comes
[25:48] to immigration
[25:49] you know uh brother sergey uh the
[25:52] paperwork for his mother
[25:54] amen we just put all these things in the
[25:56] hand of the lord
[25:58] just desire that we see these things
[26:02] according to god's perfect will and so
[26:06] just good to be here amen brother sergey
[26:09] i think this was a good week to be home
[26:12] amen uh you know there's nothing like
[26:15] waiting around in the snow you know to
[26:17] remind you
[26:18] how wonderful home is amen so
[26:22] well uh i want to apologize you know i
[26:25] might have overreacted this last sunday
[26:27] i i know that we got quite a bit more
[26:31] snow and weather out our way uh than
[26:34] here in town and it's kind of after the
[26:36] fact realized maybe
[26:38] we should have just had church and i
[26:41] just you know
[26:42] always ask the lord for leadership
[26:44] wisdom
[26:46] you know forgive me if i did overreact
[26:48] if you guys were looking out at bear
[26:50] asphalt saying what is brother paul
[26:52] thinking uh but uh you know i just i
[26:55] care about you saints and well you know
[26:57] we just uh
[26:58] sometimes you know just a little
[27:00] concerned about those that have to drive
[27:02] and the roads and
[27:04] it isn't you amen it's the others that
[27:07] i'm worried
[27:08] would what they would do to you uh watch
[27:10] people slide through
[27:11] intersections and do all kinds of crazy
[27:15] things and
[27:16] anyway if i was wrong lord forgive me we
[27:19] just
[27:19] want to do the right thing for the body
[27:21] of believers
[27:22] amen let's stand as we go into the word
[27:25] tonight i want to speak to you once
[27:27] again
[27:27] on age old proverbs and tonight just
[27:30] want to speak to you
[27:31] on the thought of the quest for wisdom
[27:34] now a quest my brother and sister is not
[27:37] something that just
[27:38] happens for a moment and goes away but a
[27:41] quest is something that is long-lasting
[27:44] and laborious and
[27:45] something that you press into and you
[27:48] know wisdom
[27:49] uh several different definitions of
[27:50] wisdom but you know i like that portion
[27:53] of where it speaks about a personal
[27:57] knowledge so we're looking we're
[27:59] searching for that
[28:00] personal knowledge of a relationship
[28:03] with jesus christ not something to talk
[28:06] about you know this brother was a very
[28:08] spiritual person
[28:10] this person very spiritual but we want
[28:13] to
[28:14] just press into not for our own
[28:18] personal relationship amen
[28:21] let's turn the book of proverbs once
[28:23] again here
[28:24] uh just taking a few verses uh trust
[28:27] that it will bless you tonight amen
[28:31] a false balance is abomination
[28:35] to the lord proverbs 11 1 i'm sorry
[28:40] a false balance is abomination to the
[28:42] lord but a just
[28:43] wait is his delight when pride
[28:47] cometh then cometh shame
[28:50] but with the lowly is wisdom
[28:54] you know just reading uh and
[28:58] my bad habit here again it's either in
[29:00] influence
[29:01] or um a couple other sermons i believe
[29:05] it's in the
[29:06] sermon influence where brother branham
[29:08] says the closer
[29:09] we get to god the more humble
[29:12] we become so we cannot have a
[29:16] hearty spirit
[29:20] and say we are have a close relationship
[29:23] with the lord
[29:24] it just doesn't work when pride cometh
[29:27] then cometh shame
[29:28] but with the lowly is wisdom the
[29:30] integrity of the upright
[29:33] shall guide them but the perverseness
[29:37] of transgressors shall destroy them
[29:41] riches profit not in the day of wrath
[29:44] but righteousness delivereth from death
[29:48] the righteousness of the perfect shall
[29:51] direct his way
[29:53] but the wicked shall fall by his own
[29:56] wickedness
[29:57] the righteousness of the upright shall
[30:00] deliver them
[30:01] but transgressors shall be taken in
[30:03] their own
[30:04] naughtiness when a wicked man dieth his
[30:08] expectation
[30:09] shall perish and the hope of the unjust
[30:12] men
[30:13] perisheth the righteous is delivered out
[30:16] of trouble
[30:17] oh can someone say amen the righteous is
[30:20] delivered out of trouble
[30:22] and the wicked cometh in his stead
[30:25] oh my a hypocrite
[30:29] with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor
[30:33] but through knowledge shall the just be
[30:36] delivered
[30:37] when it goeth well with the righteous
[30:39] the city i love these verses right here
[30:41] because i believe we can apply this to
[30:43] right into
[30:44] our cities where we live
[30:48] when it goes well with the righteous the
[30:50] city rejoices when the wicked
[30:52] perish there is shouting by the blessing
[30:55] of the upright
[30:57] the city is exalted but it is overthrown
[31:00] by the mouth
[31:01] of the wicked he that is void of wisdom
[31:04] despise
[31:05] his neighbor but a man of understanding
[31:08] holdeth his peace
[31:10] a tale bearer revealeth secrets but he
[31:12] that is of a faithful spirit
[31:14] concealeth the matter where no counsel
[31:18] is
[31:18] the people fall but in the multitude of
[31:21] counselors
[31:22] there is safety heavenly father we just
[31:26] ask
[31:26] lord for your blessings tonight and lord
[31:29] just ask you to reach out
[31:30] father tonight i lift my mother lord
[31:33] having chosen to take this vaccine
[31:35] father it is struck her very hard lord
[31:39] and
[31:39] we just ask you lord jesus just to
[31:42] come and touch her tonight be her
[31:45] portion
[31:46] father give strength to her body
[31:48] encouragement to her soul
[31:50] lord ask you to be with each and every
[31:52] one father the
[31:54] the needs the requests unspoken of this
[31:56] body of believers
[31:58] we lift them before you tonight and
[32:00] those lord who would not be here tonight
[32:02] for whatever reason
[32:04] we just send your holy spirit out and
[32:07] ask you lord to be their portion be
[32:09] their strength be their comfort
[32:11] lord we love you and adore you father
[32:14] desire
[32:15] lord to walk so upright father
[32:18] lord that we could have lord the word
[32:20] spoken
[32:21] about us as it was lord about enoch
[32:25] father we come now with confidence in
[32:27] you tonight
[32:28] asking you to speak to us through your
[32:30] word in the name of jesus christ
[32:33] amen you may be seated
[32:36] i want to just take a few minutes as it
[32:39] is to go through these scriptures as we
[32:41] have been doing
[32:43] i was joking with sister jerry tonight
[32:45] she was telling me paul it's time to go
[32:47] and i said you know honey i haven't
[32:50] preached in so long i've forgotten how
[32:52] to
[32:53] how to put all this together and uh
[32:56] so you know uh it certainly
[32:59] uh tonight seemed to be a little more
[33:03] difficult to
[33:04] to get my thoughts put out but as we
[33:07] look at this you know i believe a person
[33:09] could take a whole
[33:10] sermon or series on verse one a false
[33:14] balance is abomination to the lord
[33:16] but a just wait is his delight and we
[33:19] look at that and realize by
[33:21] a false balance my brother and sister
[33:23] will first start and put it in the deal
[33:26] of someone doing business and as they
[33:28] would uh maybe adjust the scale in their
[33:31] own
[33:31] favor that they would uh be able to uh
[33:34] take a portion uh un uh
[33:38] justified but take a portion from each
[33:40] and every person that they
[33:42] dealt business with and and you know
[33:44] that is just um
[33:46] you know even in the day that we live in
[33:48] uh the the law the government
[33:50] uh they certify scales to make sure that
[33:53] it has been checked out that it is a
[33:56] balanced
[33:57] scale a a accurate or fair scale
[34:00] and we would we would definitely want
[34:03] that you know
[34:04] in in the world i live in uh everything
[34:06] is done by weight and you don't want to
[34:09] uh find out that you know over time you
[34:12] had been defrauded
[34:13] because of something that was inaccurate
[34:16] but my brother and sister
[34:17] just to step out of this realm for just
[34:20] a moment
[34:21] i want to uh put this in a slightly
[34:23] different context if i may tonight
[34:26] for just a moment uh when we talk about
[34:29] the word of god
[34:30] we talk about a balanced message we talk
[34:33] about a
[34:34] balanced stand upon the word we don't
[34:36] want to
[34:37] veer uh hard to the left or hard to the
[34:40] right
[34:40] but we want to stay right in the center
[34:44] and you know if the word of god being
[34:46] presented
[34:47] uh is presented in such a way people
[34:49] having confidence in the leadership
[34:51] around them
[34:52] if that is presented with a false
[34:54] balance
[34:55] it will cause people to pull in a
[34:58] certain or go in a certain direction
[35:00] and they will believe that their outlook
[35:03] or their view
[35:04] of the word of god the the scripture and
[35:07] of the message
[35:08] they would believe that it was correct
[35:10] but yet if that balance upon the word
[35:13] is not correct if it has been skewered
[35:16] it will cause people to to lean or be
[35:19] pulled into certain directions
[35:21] and that's why uh you know a part of
[35:24] of you know a little humor in there
[35:26] brother george you know takes that
[35:28] little level with him everywhere he goes
[35:31] and you look at that and realize that it
[35:34] is a significance
[35:35] that he is trying to convey and uh
[35:38] i would say amen to and that is we need
[35:41] to
[35:42] preach a balanced message and we need to
[35:46] live
[35:46] balanced lives we don't want to be
[35:49] caught up in lives that are
[35:51] off in the fringes uh i remember many
[35:54] years ago brother donnie reagan put it
[35:55] this way he said you know people they
[35:58] they drive
[35:58] down the ditch and all the cans and the
[36:00] weeds and the trash is all flying out in
[36:03] front of their vehicle
[36:04] and then something comes along and shows
[36:06] them that they shouldn't be there
[36:08] but getting into the center of the road
[36:10] is actually more difficult
[36:12] and often times you come out of the
[36:14] ditch and you fly over into the other
[36:16] ditch and
[36:17] move from maybe you know as it would be
[36:20] too
[36:20] too liberal you become too legal or too
[36:23] legal become
[36:24] too liberal and you know what we want to
[36:26] do is just
[36:27] be able to go right down the center of
[36:30] the the road as it were the revealed
[36:32] word of the hour
[36:33] has been promised amen by the word of
[36:36] god it is promised to you and i my
[36:38] brother and sister
[36:39] that it will deliver us amen so the
[36:41] goods have been promised to be delivered
[36:43] to us as sons and daughters of god can
[36:45] we say amen to that
[36:47] and so we can stand upon that but we
[36:50] want to remain
[36:51] balanced and uh so you know i i just uh
[36:55] that struck me as i look at that you
[36:57] know
[36:58] and i think lord help us uh to remain
[37:01] balanced and you know pride cometh and
[37:04] then cometh shame and
[37:05] you know i think each one of us could uh
[37:08] just testify in our own life
[37:10] you know that we kind of think that
[37:12] we've got something
[37:13] figured out and uh we we think we're
[37:16] good at that or we've got it
[37:18] under control you know like well i i
[37:20] just decided you know
[37:22] i'm gonna do something and so it's no
[37:24] longer an issue in my life and then we
[37:26] we get raised up in that and think that
[37:28] we're quite the christian
[37:30] and then something happens in our life
[37:32] that reminds us that without christ
[37:35] we're nothing
[37:36] amen but with the lowly is wisdom and
[37:39] and you know i would rather be you know
[37:42] in the natural let me put it this way
[37:43] i'd rather be
[37:44] good at what i do and just let
[37:48] that be my testimony than to
[37:51] speak about how good i am i've done that
[37:54] a few times in my life of
[37:56] how how good i was and i i'll just share
[37:58] this bit of humor one time uh
[38:01] i was painting a a uh
[38:05] and these guys that were working with me
[38:07] and i'm
[38:08] spraying these uh stairwell shadow boxes
[38:12] you know they're like 12 feet off the
[38:14] off the floor
[38:15] and while i'm on top of a ladder
[38:16] spraying these i make a comment
[38:19] to one of the guys that says you know
[38:21] about the last 10 houses i've painted i
[38:23] didn't have a single run
[38:25] and so i'm spraying those deals and we
[38:27] get down and
[38:28] we shut all the lights off luck turn the
[38:31] heat up lock the house up and leave i
[38:32] come back in the morning
[38:34] and the paint had run so much it had
[38:36] actually dripped on the floor and
[38:37] created a little pyramid
[38:40] and and i i thought how could that be
[38:42] and i realized it was god reminding me
[38:45] that it doesn't pay to boast
[38:47] amen you know that last little bit that
[38:50] you just think you have accomplished
[38:52] it doesn't pay to boast so you know to
[38:54] take the position
[38:55] that i am who i am today by the grace
[38:59] of god it is not of my ability not of my
[39:03] strength my wisdom uh not my
[39:07] spirituality
[39:08] uh it's not my own righteousness because
[39:10] lots of filthy rags but
[39:12] to remember that god is why we are great
[39:16] and i will tell you tonight and that
[39:19] concept
[39:20] i will tell you tonight we are great
[39:23] by the grace of god the word poured out
[39:26] in our day has made a people that in the
[39:30] eyes of god a bride that in the eyes of
[39:33] god
[39:34] is the greatest wife that he could ever
[39:37] have
[39:38] amen this is not us boasting in our
[39:40] flesh but it is
[39:42] boasting in him and i say thank you lord
[39:45] that we can stand tonight and say
[39:47] we are the blood-washed bride of jesus
[39:50] christ
[39:51] amen and in our own humanness we know
[39:54] our failure but when we get into the
[39:57] vision of the word
[39:59] that vision my brother and sister is so
[40:01] much greater
[40:03] than we comprehend it that vision of the
[40:06] word is so
[40:07] much more so much more benefit and and
[40:10] so much more
[40:11] overcoming power and so much more glory
[40:14] than we
[40:15] even comprehend and if we step into that
[40:18] and realize
[40:19] who i am in jesus christ is not based
[40:22] upon
[40:22] a fleshly human element but it is based
[40:25] upon christ himself
[40:27] declaring this is my bride
[40:30] oh isn't that a wonderful thing to be
[40:32] able to stand on that
[40:34] and and to be able to accept the word of
[40:37] god and what it says about us today
[40:40] why my brother and sister do you realize
[40:42] that in the hour we're living and we we
[40:44] won't go into this i'm a little off
[40:46] track here
[40:46] but we won't go into this but you
[40:48] realize in the hour we're living
[40:50] the word of god says that there would be
[40:52] power poured out
[40:54] into the people of this hour now my
[40:57] brother and sister
[40:58] i say it's time for us to stand up and
[41:01] say lord
[41:02] i am being prepared and i believe i am
[41:05] prepared
[41:06] to receive and exhibit this power
[41:10] now it is not our power my brother and
[41:12] sister you understand that the prophet
[41:14] of god says we don't have power
[41:16] but we have authority in the word of god
[41:20] but the power is there and it's time for
[41:22] us to take the authority we've been
[41:24] given by god
[41:25] and take that and let that now work
[41:28] in our lives that we can realize that it
[41:31] is not us any longer
[41:33] it'll never be us from this point on you
[41:36] need to
[41:36] remind yourself it is not me it is
[41:39] christ
[41:40] in me and i'm standing on that because
[41:43] he said i will never leave you nor
[41:45] forsake you
[41:46] so here is his promise that whatever you
[41:48] walk through
[41:49] whatever you face he's right there with
[41:52] you
[41:53] oh thank you lord hallelujah
[42:03] riches prophets not in the day of wrath
[42:06] boy we understand that the story of the
[42:08] rich ruler
[42:10] but righteousness delivereth from death
[42:14] now we look all through the bible and
[42:15] understand that my brother and sister as
[42:17] jesus was speaking
[42:19] uh over the little girl he's talking
[42:21] about how she's not dead she just sleeps
[42:24] she's just sleeping amen you see
[42:28] we as christians don't have to worry
[42:32] about death
[42:33] isn't that interesting might throw dirt
[42:36] on top of our box
[42:37] but we're already gone hallelujah all
[42:41] you're doing is throwing dirt
[42:42] on top of our box because we are
[42:46] gone oh isn't that the beauty
[42:49] my brother and sister the righteousness
[42:51] of the perfect shall direct his way
[42:55] but the wicked shall fall by his own
[42:57] wickedness
[42:58] you know my brother and sister look at
[43:00] this if we was just to wait it out
[43:01] tonight
[43:02] the benefits of being righteous now it's
[43:05] not our own righteousness we know that
[43:07] right
[43:08] it's nothing that we could achieve
[43:10] nothing that we could do
[43:12] but it's his righteousness manifested
[43:15] in us which is the very life
[43:18] of jesus christ there is no
[43:21] righteousness outside of him
[43:23] and so the righteousness of the perfect
[43:26] in other words god has declared
[43:28] that you are a righteous individual
[43:31] and this righteousness my brother and
[43:33] sister which is none other than the holy
[43:35] ghost
[43:36] is going to excuse me that frog just
[43:41] i didn't even think i brought him to
[43:42] church with me
[43:45] now righteousness which is the holy
[43:47] ghost in you my brother and sister
[43:50] is what's guiding us there's nothing
[43:52] that we have done you say well
[43:54] praise the lord i'm thankful for the
[43:56] good decisions that i have made
[43:59] well we could rephrase that and say
[44:01] thank you lord
[44:02] for the anointing to make the right
[44:04] decision
[44:05] because it is not within us as humans
[44:08] within our ability
[44:09] to actually guide our own life amen
[44:13] so we look at this uh righteousness
[44:15] verse 6
[44:16] of the upright shall deliver them but
[44:19] the transgressor shall be taken in their
[44:21] own naughtiness
[44:22] and we look in the world today my
[44:23] brother and sister and and there is a
[44:25] great degree
[44:27] of naughtiness uh you look at that and
[44:30] realize
[44:30] that this naughtiness is a a as it were
[44:33] of a child i have a little granddaughter
[44:36] she has perfected the realm
[44:38] of naughtiness she can look at you and
[44:41] smile she'll say things like i love you
[44:44] grandpa
[44:46] and a minute later she's got her hand in
[44:47] the cookie jar
[44:49] now you know in her thinking that i love
[44:52] you grandpa
[44:53] is what paid for the cookie that she's
[44:56] taking
[44:58] a little bit of naughtiness and that is
[45:01] something that has
[45:02] invaded i believe in the christian world
[45:04] into the churches
[45:06] that the church itself while claiming
[45:08] christ claiming the blood
[45:09] claiming salvation has this anointing
[45:13] of naughtiness that they believe is kind
[45:16] of
[45:16] acceptable when you start to
[45:19] explain things my brother and sister i
[45:22] know i didn't do right
[45:24] but god understands
[45:28] that's naughtiness if the word speaks
[45:31] against
[45:32] it the word speaks to to
[45:35] hinder or or or sent that aside
[45:38] and and we are partakers of it
[45:42] and then we try to explain that god
[45:45] understands
[45:46] well let me agree with you god
[45:49] understands
[45:50] that you are being naughty that you are
[45:54] transgressing willfully knowing that
[45:57] what you're doing is not absolutely
[45:59] correct
[46:00] but if we have embraced a church
[46:03] doctrine
[46:05] of close is close enough
[46:09] are we going to embrace that
[46:13] no we're not the people called to live
[46:16] close
[46:17] enough we're the people that are called
[46:20] to live the word not as close as
[46:24] man can get remember as brother branham
[46:26] brings out the story
[46:27] about the men and the chariots uh going
[46:30] on the mountain and
[46:32] the cliff and one talking about how that
[46:35] he can run his horses as fast as they
[46:37] can go
[46:38] and and keep his wheel right there on
[46:40] the very edge
[46:42] another man talking about how that he
[46:44] would run it
[46:45] and the third man saying you know i like
[46:47] to stay
[46:48] just as close as i can to the inside you
[46:51] see
[46:52] that's where the real believer is the
[46:54] prophet of god lays that out to us
[46:56] that's where the real believer
[46:57] wants to stay we want to stay just as
[46:59] close as we can
[47:02] not out here in the realm of naughtiness
[47:05] but standing upon that
[47:11] we would look here you know i was
[47:14] thinking about
[47:15] by the blessing of the upper eye the
[47:17] city is exalted in verse 11
[47:19] but it's overthrown by the mouth of the
[47:21] wicked
[47:23] you know i truly believe there is
[47:26] something
[47:26] about when there are
[47:29] real christians in a city
[47:32] that there is a blessing or something
[47:36] positive you remember when brother
[47:39] branham was holding services in iowa and
[47:42] the people were there and
[47:45] they were totally disrespectful
[47:47] unresponsive
[47:49] disrespectful people were laughing and
[47:51] talking and
[47:52] as though they were at some kind of
[47:54] sporting event and
[47:56] and just generally misbehaving and
[47:59] brother branham
[47:59] speaks and he says
[48:03] to the words that this city will never
[48:06] have
[48:06] anything of significance you can go back
[48:10] and study that and i know of
[48:12] brothers that live in those areas around
[48:15] those places
[48:16] and they say those cities are
[48:18] particularly ungodly
[48:20] cities very few churches very worldly
[48:22] behaviors even amongst what churches are
[48:25] there
[48:26] and you know you realize that it is the
[48:28] kind of
[48:29] effect you know cause and effect that in
[48:32] a city
[48:33] i believe this same thing myself
[48:34] personally for a business
[48:37] you say well maybe uh a certain business
[48:40] would
[48:40] would be uh not really a godly business
[48:43] they don't really have a godly culture
[48:46] but you know maybe we would pick on
[48:48] walmart um brother tim works there
[48:50] that store will prosper that store will
[48:53] will be
[48:54] a a store that they will say this store
[48:56] is blessed
[48:57] because it is supporting a son of god
[49:00] and
[49:01] and it would be in each and every one of
[49:02] you and the work that you do
[49:04] those things will be there because god
[49:07] said that he
[49:08] would take care of you and so they will
[49:10] be blessed because they then become
[49:13] the the grain the garner that is
[49:16] supplying the grain
[49:17] to a son or daughter of god and and you
[49:20] look at that and realize the effect that
[49:22] god because he promised he would take
[49:24] care of you
[49:24] that it has a tremendous effect even
[49:27] upon a whole city
[49:28] but you see whenever the wicked become
[49:31] the mouthpiece of the city
[49:33] then you'll see those cities have great
[49:35] problems i could go into a story of a
[49:38] city in california but we won't take the
[49:40] time
[49:40] about how that they basically at a point
[49:43] in time
[49:44] said we don't care if there's a single
[49:46] church
[49:47] left in this city and it was only
[49:50] a short time later that there was found
[49:53] that there was embezzlement and graft
[49:55] and all kinds of
[49:56] corrupt behaviors and the city filed for
[49:59] bankruptcy
[50:00] and all of the city government was had
[50:02] to be replaced and many of them were
[50:04] indicted
[50:05] my brother and sister you see when you
[50:08] would come
[50:08] boldly to stand against god
[50:12] the blessings of god would leave but to
[50:16] embrace that we'll see how that god will
[50:18] bless
[50:19] a city or a company to take care of
[50:22] their own
[50:23] hallelujah now i want to just uh hurry
[50:27] through this
[50:28] verse 12 he that is void of wisdom
[50:31] despises his neighbor but a man of
[50:34] understanding holdeth
[50:36] his peace see my brother and sister
[50:40] sometimes we'll find that
[50:43] our attitude to those around us
[50:48] is actually a direct reflection of our
[50:52] testimony
[50:54] and no matter what we say we are
[50:57] if what we speak and do doesn't match up
[51:01] they will go with what we speak and do
[51:04] and so you look at this we want to
[51:08] befriend right the scripture says to
[51:10] make friends of those of the mammon
[51:13] make friends of those around you now
[51:15] this might seem like a different
[51:17] approach make friends with your
[51:20] neighbors
[51:22] that maybe they'll have opportunity to
[51:24] bless you
[51:26] now that could be misunderstood as
[51:28] though we're looking for someone to give
[51:30] us something
[51:31] but we're not we're actually offering
[51:34] them opportunity
[51:36] to do something good that might affect
[51:39] their life
[51:41] and so we want to give them the
[51:44] opportunity
[51:45] to do something good for us and so you
[51:49] look at that and
[51:50] besides that i can tell you from
[51:51] personal experience
[51:53] even if they're not believers even if
[51:55] they're not christians
[51:56] your neighbors in many circumstances
[51:59] will of their heart do many good things
[52:01] for you
[52:03] amen hallelujah now i want to just come
[52:07] here and step down through my thoughts
[52:09] so i don't keep you too long tonight
[52:11] you see it's a very common theme through
[52:13] the proverbs
[52:14] to see the words wisdom and knowledge
[52:17] used they're
[52:18] they're they're very frequently over and
[52:21] over and over again
[52:22] in the proverbs speaking of wisdom and
[52:24] knowledge and
[52:25] and uh and the context that they're
[52:28] brought it's speaking of those that
[52:30] have wisdom and have knowledge are
[52:32] blessed and you can kind of go through
[52:34] it and read
[52:35] and find that it's talking about those
[52:37] that are lacking
[52:38] my brother and sister they have all
[52:40] kinds of maladies all kinds of things
[52:43] that afflict them because of the lacking
[52:47] of wisdom and knowledge and so you
[52:49] realize by
[52:50] reading this that the the stages set and
[52:53] the encouragement is made
[52:55] for one to seek wisdom and to seek
[52:58] knowledge and
[52:59] you know brother branham says here in
[53:01] the message god keeps his word
[53:03] he said lookie here the first gift in
[53:06] the line of gifts
[53:07] is wisdom the second is knowledge
[53:10] and if you don't have any wisdom how do
[53:14] you know what to do with knowledge
[53:18] so you see how that these two parallel
[53:20] with each other
[53:21] and even though if you would look in
[53:23] webster and they will
[53:24] interchange wisdom and knowledge but my
[53:27] brother and sister we understand as
[53:29] bible readers
[53:30] that this gift of wisdom is just exactly
[53:34] that
[53:34] in fact brother branham says the wisdom
[53:38] is a gift of god
[53:41] so this is not a worldly wisdom in the
[53:43] way that they would say it's not a
[53:45] worldly knowledge in the way that they
[53:47] would say
[53:48] but this would come into the realm of
[53:51] revelation
[53:52] this would come that when god gives us
[53:54] wisdom
[53:55] then we know to how to act upon the word
[53:59] that is revealed to us
[54:01] and when he gives us knowledge my
[54:03] brother and sister
[54:04] that is in essence the understanding
[54:07] of what has been revealed to you you can
[54:11] say
[54:11] i have a revelation but if you don't
[54:14] understand
[54:15] truly this is what happens many times
[54:17] brother branham talking about people
[54:19] with dreams
[54:20] how that they are they want to know what
[54:22] the dreams mean
[54:24] and brother branham talking about that
[54:25] how that when men
[54:27] in a carnal element would come just to
[54:29] discern
[54:30] your dream well let me just tell you how
[54:33] crazy dreams can be
[54:35] i had a dream one night here recently
[54:37] and it tormented me
[54:39] somehow i woke up in the morning i felt
[54:41] like i worked all night
[54:42] and it's because i had snuck out and i
[54:44] had bought a lottery ticket
[54:46] and in that lottery ticket i won 600 and
[54:49] some
[54:50] million dollars now this is quite a
[54:53] dream right
[54:54] wow i mean you guys had forgive me for
[54:56] buying the lottery ticket especially if
[54:58] i paid my tithe and took you all out for
[55:00] something
[55:01] well no there wasn't too many head
[55:03] shaking there
[55:05] but you see in this dream what happened
[55:07] was is i
[55:08] i i won all this money but everywhere i
[55:12] went and everything i did i would go and
[55:14] i would open the front door of my home
[55:16] and there would be hundreds of people
[55:18] there saying you have money give to me
[55:20] give to me give to me
[55:22] and in the dream sister jerry and i are
[55:24] on an airplane flying to arizona to see
[55:26] our grandchildren
[55:27] and we're sitting here they're very
[55:29] incognito on the airplane
[55:31] and suddenly someone sitting in front
[55:33] turns and goes you're that man
[55:35] and then pretty soon including the
[55:37] stewardesses were lined up
[55:39] asking for money in the airplane and in
[55:41] this dream
[55:42] it was this confused jumble of thoughts
[55:45] and in the end as it was half asleep
[55:47] half a week
[55:48] i was there saying no i don't want the
[55:51] money
[55:53] now interpret that for me
[55:56] well we could start shouldn't buy a
[55:58] lottery ticket
[55:59] well that doesn't have anything with
[56:01] dream we shouldn't be buying them anyhow
[56:04] but all the confusion you see somebody
[56:06] might say there's something spiritual in
[56:08] there
[56:08] we'll search till we find it but you see
[56:11] the prophet of god showed us
[56:12] that without the holy ghost discerning
[56:15] what that
[56:16] was all we could do is come up with a
[56:17] whole jumble of stuff
[56:19] i think this looks like this i think
[56:21] this looks like this this
[56:23] must mean that you see so we need wisdom
[56:26] to even understand what we uh would
[56:30] would have i guess you would say in
[56:32] normal life
[56:33] in everyday life we need the wisdom of
[56:35] god we need
[56:36] understanding and we need not to go
[56:38] venturing this one i'm talking about the
[56:40] balance
[56:41] we need to not go venturing out here
[56:42] trying to get spiritual
[56:44] unless god wants you to discern that god
[56:47] wants you to see or there is something
[56:49] but what if that was just something that
[56:52] some comment that was said and something
[56:54] lodged in your head
[56:55] and you went to bed and i mean this
[56:57] seriously you went to bed with a case of
[56:59] indigestion
[57:00] and your body's just not happy and
[57:02] everything's done and your thoughts are
[57:03] all jumbled and
[57:04] and and then we try to spiritualize it
[57:09] you see we have to let god do this work
[57:13] if we start to do this in our own then
[57:15] we have nothing but a problem
[57:17] lookie here the first gift in line of
[57:19] gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge
[57:21] and if you don't have any wisdom how do
[57:23] you know what to do
[57:25] with knowledge seek the best things
[57:27] first
[57:28] wisdom and if you ain't got wisdom what
[57:31] can you do with knowledge or speaking
[57:33] with tongue or these other things
[57:35] it takes wisdom it takes
[57:38] god's wisdom solomon said
[57:41] call it your mother now
[57:46] what would he call it your mother for
[57:50] because nurturing
[57:53] is the nature of a mother let wisdom
[57:57] nurture you nurture does not
[58:01] expect you to go from a baby and
[58:03] swaddling clothes
[58:06] to a job in a month
[58:10] you nurture you teach you let it come
[58:13] and
[58:13] i say god help us to to seek
[58:17] real true godly wisdom and let that
[58:20] guide our lives let that be what
[58:22] makes the decision of the job that i
[58:24] work where i live
[58:26] what i do let godly wisdom come and
[58:29] when the knowledge of what god wants you
[58:31] to do comes to you
[58:33] that we would have the understanding in
[58:35] how to
[58:36] interpret that you say well my brother
[58:39] and sister i i believe that this
[58:41] is offered to me i've shared this before
[58:43] in the church about how i was preaching
[58:45] at a church back east
[58:46] and god totally unbeknownst to me
[58:48] nothing spiritual on my side
[58:50] i just chose an analogy of a man taking
[58:53] a job
[58:54] and that is drawing him away from god
[58:56] and saying well praise the lord
[58:57] i'm getting you know a a better paycheck
[59:00] and
[59:01] i get this all i have to do is work
[59:02] sundays and wednesday
[59:05] little did i know there was a young man
[59:07] sitting on the very front row of the
[59:08] church
[59:09] that sunday morning that was supposed to
[59:11] call when church was over
[59:13] to his foreman and let him know whether
[59:15] he was going to accept a job that was
[59:18] going to cause him to work sundays and
[59:20] wednesdays
[59:21] and god in his infinite grace and mercy
[59:23] my brother and sister
[59:24] no man's input no man's understanding no
[59:27] man knowing why he's speaking those
[59:29] words
[59:29] but god knowing and god coming in what
[59:32] we would call wisdom
[59:33] and saying he's going to make a mistake
[59:36] if i don't
[59:37] intervene and god choosing then to let a
[59:39] complete stranger
[59:41] speak the words that comes as a word of
[59:43] knowledge if you want to put it that way
[59:45] to that young man and he's sitting in
[59:47] church and he's there going i believe i
[59:49] have an
[59:49] answer he'd been praying honestly
[59:51] praying god had an answer you know this
[59:52] is a great opportunity
[59:54] much more wages and a chance to go into
[59:56] management and oh lord i think this is
[59:59] from you
[1:00:01] but a word of knowledge if you want to
[1:00:03] put it that way
[1:00:04] comes it's god's wisdom speaking to him
[1:00:07] this is a trap of the devil
[1:00:10] what you believe is going to be a
[1:00:11] blessing from me
[1:00:13] is actually a trap of the devil it was
[1:00:16] kind of interesting because sister jerry
[1:00:18] was sitting with the pastor's wife
[1:00:20] and that sister was sitting farther down
[1:00:21] that same pew that's a mother i should
[1:00:24] say
[1:00:24] and she just jumps up and she's
[1:00:26] screaming and hollering and waving her
[1:00:28] arms around
[1:00:29] because she recognized this was
[1:00:32] something from god speaking right to
[1:00:34] this situation
[1:00:35] my brother and sister we have to be able
[1:00:37] to understand that
[1:00:38] that young man could have said well
[1:00:41] praise the lord
[1:00:42] i know this is of god i mean this is
[1:00:44] what i feel like the lord
[1:00:45] showed me that the young man told me he
[1:00:47] says i was going to call them
[1:00:50] i was going to accept that job because
[1:00:53] it came with a substantial pay raise
[1:00:55] and he was thinking all the good things
[1:00:57] that he could do in his life
[1:00:58] with the extra money but god come
[1:01:02] and give him wisdom through the
[1:01:03] preaching of the word here again
[1:01:05] remove me out of the picture clueless
[1:01:08] but it was god speaking bringing wisdom
[1:01:11] to this young man to recognize
[1:01:13] this is not of god this is from the
[1:01:16] devil
[1:01:17] amen so call it your mother let
[1:01:20] wisdom nurture you can i ask you a
[1:01:24] question
[1:01:26] when's the last time you prayed that
[1:01:28] wisdom would nurture you
[1:01:32] i don't think it's a common theme
[1:01:37] that we pray for
[1:01:41] am i on pointer off
[1:01:46] lord i need wisdom i don't need an
[1:01:49] answer lord like
[1:01:51] if you want me to buy a pickup let there
[1:01:53] be one for a good price on craigslist
[1:01:57] no that's that's not
[1:02:00] reason it's cheap on craigslist is
[1:02:02] because it has no oil pressure
[1:02:05] fixing to die he poured some of that
[1:02:09] bars oil
[1:02:10] in it you know the stuff that looks like
[1:02:12] molasses
[1:02:14] looks real good my brother and sister
[1:02:17] you see wisdom
[1:02:19] is what we really need you see let
[1:02:22] wisdom nurture you
[1:02:23] because when wisdom nurtures us my
[1:02:26] brother and sister
[1:02:28] we'll find that our decisions are much
[1:02:31] more
[1:02:32] solidified our decisions are anchored in
[1:02:35] the word of god our
[1:02:37] our decisions if i could put it this way
[1:02:39] are anchored in a blessing for you
[1:02:43] now blessings are not always monetary
[1:02:46] blessings can simply be the word being
[1:02:48] open to you because you
[1:02:50] allowed god to take you into the word
[1:02:53] instead of ourselves trying to push our
[1:02:55] way in
[1:02:57] you know that's how my brother and
[1:02:58] sister we get a lot of isms
[1:03:00] see the lack of wisdom is why there's a
[1:03:02] lot of isms around the message
[1:03:04] men have pressed into things they have
[1:03:07] set down and
[1:03:09] they have built great charts and graphs
[1:03:11] and
[1:03:12] they have taken the different meanings
[1:03:14] of words and
[1:03:15] all the different definitions and
[1:03:16] figured out at what point in the
[1:03:18] scripture this definition of this word
[1:03:20] applies
[1:03:21] and then we come and we come up with
[1:03:23] what we call logical conclusions
[1:03:27] that in god's eyes are completely
[1:03:29] illogical
[1:03:31] because man pressed into it
[1:03:35] you see it seems in the world we're
[1:03:38] living in that there's
[1:03:39] actually a lack of wisdom and knowledge
[1:03:42] we have ideas we press into them
[1:03:47] you know my brother and sister
[1:03:51] you can have what i would call a
[1:03:53] complete fabrication
[1:03:55] of a man's idea now i hope you're with
[1:03:58] me
[1:03:59] a complete fabrication of a man's idea
[1:04:03] and back it up with scripture and
[1:04:06] quotes and it be completely wrong
[1:04:12] isn't it amazing how god allowed that to
[1:04:14] happen
[1:04:16] that we can justify let me just say
[1:04:19] this way someone can justify their
[1:04:22] position
[1:04:24] by scripture and quotes
[1:04:27] and be completely wrong
[1:04:31] let me also put this to you
[1:04:35] satan did not seduce eve
[1:04:38] in one afternoon
[1:04:45] by the fabrication
[1:04:49] of his idea you've heard this preached
[1:04:53] go back just once again look in your
[1:04:55] bible
[1:04:57] you see satan removed
[1:05:01] the personal deity of god
[1:05:04] and it went from the lord god
[1:05:09] to god impersonal
[1:05:13] by the fabrication of the words by the
[1:05:16] approach the application of it
[1:05:18] he removed the personal side of god
[1:05:21] out of the equation now i'm telling you
[1:05:24] he still uses that tactic today
[1:05:27] he's still trying to make god an
[1:05:30] impersonal
[1:05:31] god to you and i that we start to think
[1:05:33] he doesn't care about little old me he
[1:05:36] doesn't care about my world he doesn't
[1:05:38] care about my problems
[1:05:39] and satan's there taking that but if
[1:05:42] you'll look in your bibles again there
[1:05:43] in genesis 3 i believe it is
[1:05:45] and you'll find that the minute he
[1:05:47] deceived eve he come right back with
[1:05:49] lord god
[1:05:52] because you see now the condemnation
[1:05:55] is personal see how tricky he is
[1:06:00] how he fabricates how he molds it
[1:06:03] how he presents it in his fashion for
[1:06:06] his benefit
[1:06:07] but we as sons and daughters of god my
[1:06:09] brother and sister we have come
[1:06:11] and i pray from this day on if you have
[1:06:13] not prayed for wisdom that you will pray
[1:06:15] for wisdom
[1:06:16] that at this point right now we'll have
[1:06:18] the wisdom to discern
[1:06:19] what is of god and what is of satan uh
[1:06:22] what is
[1:06:23] our position and what is the devil's
[1:06:25] position
[1:06:26] because we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:29] that means we were always in god and we
[1:06:32] are
[1:06:32] his very flesh the prophet of god said
[1:06:35] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:06:37] we are one with him amen and we need the
[1:06:41] wisdom to be able to apply that
[1:06:43] in our life and not allow satan to put
[1:06:46] this
[1:06:47] into an impersonal realm where when he
[1:06:50] turns the table our condemnation is
[1:06:52] personal
[1:06:54] but he wants an impersonal god when he's
[1:06:57] trying to trip you up
[1:07:07] let's just go in first corinthians
[1:07:11] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:07:12] them that perish foolishness
[1:07:14] but unto us which are saved it is the
[1:07:16] power of god
[1:07:18] for it is written i will destroy the
[1:07:20] wisdom of the wives
[1:07:22] so god's promised to take the wisdom of
[1:07:26] the wise
[1:07:28] and he's going to crush it now i don't
[1:07:31] mean to talk politics here tonight
[1:07:34] but all you have to do is turn on your
[1:07:36] computer
[1:07:37] and look at what they're talking about
[1:07:40] doing
[1:07:42] you know congress no longer has he's and
[1:07:44] she's
[1:07:46] there are a bunch of its and i'll agree
[1:07:49] with that
[1:07:50] they're a bunch of its idiots
[1:07:57] see they've lost all wisdom we are
[1:08:00] printing money out of thin
[1:08:01] air to stimulate you so that you'll be
[1:08:04] banked
[1:08:05] up later because you can't afford to
[1:08:07] live because of inflation
[1:08:09] but no problem you feel good now
[1:08:13] they have and i won't go into it because
[1:08:14] it just depresses me
[1:08:17] but you see my brother and sister you
[1:08:19] can look at what's happening in our
[1:08:21] nation
[1:08:21] and recognize a complete lack of wisdom
[1:08:26] so is this scripture fulfilled this day
[1:08:29] before our eyes
[1:08:31] i believe it is amen he's destroyed the
[1:08:35] wisdom of
[1:08:36] those that think they're wise and will
[1:08:38] bring to nothing the understanding
[1:08:40] of the prudent where is the wise where
[1:08:43] is the scribe where is the disputer of
[1:08:45] this world hath
[1:08:46] not god made foolish the wisdom of
[1:08:49] this world
[1:08:53] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[1:08:55] world by wisdom knew not
[1:08:57] god it pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:09:00] preaching to save them
[1:09:02] that believe here again i'm just going
[1:09:04] to poke at a button and leave it be
[1:09:07] the foolishness of preaching
[1:09:10] you know the man come to brother branham
[1:09:13] and he said
[1:09:15] you know brother branham uh you know the
[1:09:17] days
[1:09:18] uh you know the apostolic gift you know
[1:09:20] those days are gone
[1:09:22] now brother branham doesn't even argue
[1:09:24] with the man
[1:09:26] he just simply says to him okay the
[1:09:28] apostolic
[1:09:29] age i can show you in the bible
[1:09:33] where god gave it to the church you show
[1:09:36] me
[1:09:37] where he took it away now i want to
[1:09:40] apply this
[1:09:41] to those who say we no longer need
[1:09:43] ministers
[1:09:45] that we don't know need pastors we don't
[1:09:48] need preachers and evangelists
[1:09:49] i can show you where god put it in this
[1:09:52] scripture
[1:09:53] you show me where he took it out
[1:09:57] you see that's just a spirit it's here
[1:10:00] to confuse
[1:10:01] people because it seems reasonable
[1:10:04] you know most of these false doctrines
[1:10:06] my brother and sister came from a
[1:10:07] preacher
[1:10:08] wait all of them did
[1:10:13] but does that take away what the word
[1:10:16] said
[1:10:17] see that's what's confusing and people
[1:10:19] are saying you know i got hurt by a
[1:10:21] preacher
[1:10:21] i got hurt by this situation these guys
[1:10:24] are not preaching it straight
[1:10:25] it's not matching up with what the
[1:10:26] prophet said we don't need them well i'm
[1:10:28] sorry when you step
[1:10:30] out of there and you throw them out
[1:10:32] you've actually stepped outside the word
[1:10:33] of god your own self
[1:10:35] because god never took it out of
[1:10:37] scripture
[1:10:39] and i don't say that as a a jab against
[1:10:42] anyone
[1:10:42] i say it's a spirit that is here in this
[1:10:46] day that is trying to get people to pull
[1:10:49] back
[1:10:56] for the jews require a sign the greeks
[1:10:58] seek after wisdom but we preach christ
[1:11:00] crucified and unto jews a stumbling
[1:11:02] block
[1:11:02] under the greek's foolishness but unto
[1:11:05] them
[1:11:06] which are called hallelujah some of
[1:11:08] those here tonight
[1:11:10] got a calling praise the lord god by his
[1:11:12] grace and mercy
[1:11:13] called us just as sure as your phone
[1:11:16] goes ding-a-ling or
[1:11:17] or whatever it does for you amen just as
[1:11:20] sure as that would happen in the natural
[1:11:22] god has called us he says but unto them
[1:11:25] which are called both jews and greeks
[1:11:26] christ the power of god
[1:11:28] and the wisdom of god because the
[1:11:32] foolishness of god
[1:11:33] is wiser than men and the weakness of
[1:11:36] god is stronger than men
[1:11:37] for ye see your calling brethren how
[1:11:40] that not many wise men
[1:11:41] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[1:11:44] noble
[1:11:45] are called but god has chosen the
[1:11:47] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:11:50] the wise
[1:11:51] and god has chosen the weak things of
[1:11:53] the world
[1:11:54] to confound the things which are mighty
[1:11:56] and base things of the world and things
[1:11:58] which are despised hath god chosen yea
[1:12:01] and things which are not to bring to not
[1:12:04] things that
[1:12:04] are that no flesh should glory in his
[1:12:08] presence
[1:12:09] but of him are ye in christ jesus
[1:12:12] who of god has made unto us wisdom
[1:12:15] see now the word is telling us that
[1:12:18] jesus christ himself
[1:12:20] is made wisdom to you and i
[1:12:23] he's also then declaring breaking this
[1:12:26] sentence down in this
[1:12:27] he is made righteousness to us
[1:12:31] there should be no question in our mind
[1:12:33] when we read this scripture
[1:12:35] that he has been made wisdom to us
[1:12:38] that he has been made righteousness to
[1:12:41] us he has made sanctification to us
[1:12:44] and he is redemption to us
[1:12:47] amen so the devil with all of his little
[1:12:49] tricks all of his little lies
[1:12:51] all these things my brother and sister
[1:12:53] is here
[1:12:54] now pinned to the wall listening happy
[1:12:57] birthday to him
[1:12:58] amen he's pinned to the wall because
[1:13:01] these
[1:13:02] words if we believe our bible amen
[1:13:06] we believe our bible these words are
[1:13:08] showing us clearly
[1:13:10] of what jesus christ is to you
[1:13:13] and i the position that has been given
[1:13:17] to us but see this
[1:13:18] is so wonderful but without wisdom on
[1:13:21] our part
[1:13:22] and understanding on our part and
[1:13:25] knowledge on our part
[1:13:27] we can read this and say yes to it and
[1:13:30] never ever apply it never
[1:13:33] ever go as it were and write that check
[1:13:35] that the prophet of god was talking
[1:13:37] about
[1:13:38] oh lord help me to write the check can
[1:13:40] you say amen to that tonight lord help
[1:13:42] me to write the check
[1:13:44] when i have a need i'm discouraged i
[1:13:47] have a greater need than that
[1:13:49] something of a husband of a wife of
[1:13:51] children of parents
[1:13:52] whatever it might be family or friends
[1:13:55] whatever it might need
[1:13:56] let's have the courage to not just say
[1:13:58] oh well we hope or we're doing
[1:14:01] but write the check claim what has been
[1:14:04] given to us
[1:14:06] amen it takes knowledge to do that right
[1:14:09] now it says you know sometimes you don't
[1:14:11] have because you ask not
[1:14:13] because our problem is is when we ask
[1:14:16] we're off base
[1:14:18] we're a miss lord give us wisdom
[1:14:21] one wisdom to ask one wisdom
[1:14:25] to ask correctly so that when we would
[1:14:29] ask we're not sitting back
[1:14:32] i think of your wife for the christian
[1:14:37] this is just i'm just expressing my
[1:14:38] heart to you
[1:14:40] when she'll come to the place you
[1:14:41] mentioned something never explained it i
[1:14:43] don't expect you to you don't have to
[1:14:45] but you see when she comes to the place
[1:14:47] she starts asking god for things
[1:14:49] herself not us coaching not us pushing
[1:14:53] not us suggesting but she herself
[1:14:57] starts asking god and god starts
[1:14:59] answering
[1:15:01] then no one will ever tell that young
[1:15:03] lady ever again
[1:15:05] in her life god's not real but you see
[1:15:08] if we push it to happen and we push it
[1:15:10] to be done and we try to fabricate it
[1:15:12] and we try to bring it about
[1:15:14] all it'll do is bring confusion but you
[1:15:17] see when we have real wisdom
[1:15:20] and realize that we as a body of
[1:15:21] believers just start praying for god to
[1:15:23] reveal
[1:15:24] himself that's all that will matter
[1:15:28] that's all that will matter because
[1:15:29] he'll come down and reveal himself
[1:15:33] and then they'll be understanding
[1:15:36] hallelujah
[1:15:39] where was i
[1:15:42] thank you
[1:15:46] that according as it was written he that
[1:15:48] glorieth led him glory
[1:15:50] in the lord you want something to glory
[1:15:52] in
[1:15:53] hallelujah honestly saints we ought to
[1:15:55] be saying lord i want something to glory
[1:15:56] in
[1:15:57] i don't want to sit here and just talk
[1:15:59] about well you know have a good life and
[1:16:00] i believe the message
[1:16:02] what we should be doing is moving beyond
[1:16:04] this you know i had someone at one time
[1:16:06] kind of make a little accusation to me
[1:16:08] you know paul you are leaving brother
[1:16:11] branham behind
[1:16:14] i won't present it tonight but i've got
[1:16:16] a quote
[1:16:18] yeah to those of you need a quote i've
[1:16:20] got a quote
[1:16:22] brother branham says you'll move beyond
[1:16:25] this
[1:16:27] hmm what are we going to do with this
[1:16:30] you know why he would say you're going
[1:16:32] to move beyond this because
[1:16:34] he said i come to point you to christ
[1:16:38] and so he was speaking with confidence
[1:16:40] that the day of the
[1:16:41] introduction of you and i to jesus
[1:16:45] christ
[1:16:45] that we would be moving beyond does that
[1:16:48] mean we leave the message absolutely not
[1:16:50] because this message is jesus christ but
[1:16:53] he will come
[1:16:54] and you'll realize what he's talking
[1:16:57] about
[1:16:57] and you know i say this there's other
[1:16:59] brothers that kind of feel this way so
[1:17:01] throw us all out with the bathwater if
[1:17:02] you want
[1:17:03] but my brother and sister i think we've
[1:17:05] come to a time
[1:17:06] it's time for us to move beyond this
[1:17:09] message brother branham preached
[1:17:16] what'd you just say out loud paul no
[1:17:18] that wasn't my inner voice that was my
[1:17:19] outer voice
[1:17:22] we need to move beyond what he preached
[1:17:26] into what he preached
[1:17:30] not standing here the prophet said this
[1:17:32] the prophet said this the prophet said
[1:17:34] this the prophet said this
[1:17:36] my brother and sister anybody can read
[1:17:37] these quotes
[1:17:39] but i want to be one of those oh do you
[1:17:42] want to be one of those
[1:17:43] that steps into that open book
[1:17:46] that steps into the open word steps into
[1:17:50] the life that was being revealed by the
[1:17:53] prophet
[1:17:54] and step into that not just sitting back
[1:17:56] here saying we believe quote this
[1:17:58] quote that quote this but i want to step
[1:18:00] into it that would someone would say
[1:18:02] what did this message produce it
[1:18:03] produced me
[1:18:06] and i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of
[1:18:08] god this word their prophet come
[1:18:10] produce me but when we do that
[1:18:14] and when we say that we need to have a
[1:18:16] life
[1:18:17] that actually backs it up
[1:18:20] oh god help us god help us but you see i
[1:18:24] want to be
[1:18:25] the message that was preached manifested
[1:18:29] i don't want to just be a quotation i uh
[1:18:32] refuse
[1:18:33] i refuse to just be a quotation i am
[1:18:36] that word that was preached
[1:18:40] hallelujah did you understand me i don't
[1:18:42] want you to be confused on that
[1:18:44] hallelujah but it's time my brother and
[1:18:46] sister my
[1:18:48] the antis i was sharing a little bit
[1:18:50] little bit of a video
[1:18:52] it's kind of actually humorous in one
[1:18:54] sense uh
[1:18:55] heartbreaking in another this man is
[1:18:58] posting this deal
[1:18:59] about brother branham and so he speaks
[1:19:02] very positively of him
[1:19:03] in the sense yes he was a man sent of
[1:19:06] god and
[1:19:07] called for but just like all of these he
[1:19:09] goes off and starts quoting these
[1:19:11] other authors and these other people
[1:19:12] that he went off in the end and god took
[1:19:15] him because he got
[1:19:16] out of the will of god and and i thought
[1:19:19] you know this is interesting
[1:19:20] because this man in you know he he's
[1:19:22] talking and he's relating all these
[1:19:24] accounts and he's relating supernatural
[1:19:26] things he's relating all kinds of things
[1:19:29] and uh sister jerry just goes um
[1:19:32] paul do you realize he's not saying
[1:19:34] nothing
[1:19:36] that's right 20 minutes of nothing
[1:19:42] so that he could recount how that if
[1:19:44] brother branham had stayed just praying
[1:19:46] for the sick
[1:19:48] he would have lived longer
[1:19:52] that's his conclusion but god had to
[1:19:55] take him
[1:19:57] because he started preaching and got off
[1:20:00] of the correct things and started
[1:20:03] hitting against things like
[1:20:05] the trinity
[1:20:10] now who needs wisdom and understanding
[1:20:14] you see my brother and sister i'm not
[1:20:15] mocking the man
[1:20:17] but he felt led to make this whole video
[1:20:19] and to share it with the world
[1:20:22] and he's saying yes when he come against
[1:20:25] the trinity he left the word of god
[1:20:29] no no no no you missed
[1:20:33] wisdom knowledge
[1:20:37] no wisdom no real knowledge of the word
[1:20:41] you see my brother and sister because
[1:20:43] it's tied together very
[1:20:45] nicely now let me let me hurry up here
[1:20:49] yes let me definitely hurry up here
[1:20:52] see verse 30 again
[1:20:56] but of him
[1:21:01] where are we from but of him
[1:21:04] are ye in christ jesus who of god
[1:21:07] is made unto us right so it's christ
[1:21:10] jesus
[1:21:12] who is made unto us wisdom and
[1:21:15] righteousness
[1:21:16] and sanctification and redemption
[1:21:20] hallelujah what was it now
[1:21:24] people that don't understand the godhead
[1:21:25] would then say well
[1:21:27] christ jesus would be separate from god
[1:21:29] because god made him unto us
[1:21:32] well i'm sorry this was god's avenue
[1:21:35] of saying i'm with you
[1:21:39] i'm in you i'm above you i'm beside you
[1:21:44] i was in you before a world
[1:21:47] and i'll be in you when there is no
[1:21:54] world
[1:21:56] and that god was made wisdom and
[1:21:59] righteousness sanctification and
[1:22:00] redemption unto you and i
[1:22:02] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:22:04] god's got a great gift much beyond what
[1:22:06] we
[1:22:06] are giving him credit for and credit for
[1:22:09] the fact
[1:22:10] that we are the word manifested
[1:22:14] now psalms 37 23-25
[1:22:17] uh says that the steps of a good man are
[1:22:21] ordered by the lord and he delighteth in
[1:22:23] his way
[1:22:24] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[1:22:26] cast down for the lord
[1:22:28] upholdeth him with his hand now i want
[1:22:31] to ask you my brother and sister when we
[1:22:33] were singing happy birthday to the devil
[1:22:35] did we really feel like that or were we
[1:22:39] pushing back right
[1:22:42] victory is mine victory
[1:22:46] is my
[1:22:49] victory today is mine
[1:22:53] come on one of the days of the week
[1:22:56] the devil's going to decide it's your
[1:22:57] turn
[1:22:59] and god's going to decide it's your turn
[1:23:03] and you'll get a stand up and say you
[1:23:05] know what
[1:23:06] i am the manifested word
[1:23:11] of this day amen i am
[1:23:14] a son of god a daughter of god i am this
[1:23:17] word come to life
[1:23:18] in this generation
[1:23:21] because the steps of a good man are
[1:23:23] ordered by the lord
[1:23:26] now verse 25 is actually the one that i
[1:23:28] was seeking you see
[1:23:29] my brother and sister when we start out
[1:23:32] in life
[1:23:32] we have a perceived notion of wisdom now
[1:23:35] we wouldn't be against young men young
[1:23:38] women
[1:23:38] and their zeal and excitement life
[1:23:41] but my brother and sister we'll realize
[1:23:44] as we read this scripture here
[1:23:45] how wisdom and time temper us
[1:23:49] says i have been young
[1:23:53] and now am old so about
[1:23:56] half or better of you here tonight he's
[1:23:58] not talking to you
[1:24:00] because you're still young
[1:24:04] yet have i not seen the righteous
[1:24:06] forsaken
[1:24:08] nor his seed begging bread
[1:24:11] amen and some of you might say we've
[1:24:14] been so poor before brother paul we've
[1:24:16] been in such dire straits there was
[1:24:17] nothing
[1:24:18] on our table to eat
[1:24:22] but god had it all in control god knew
[1:24:25] the beginning from the end and he knew
[1:24:27] every bit in the middle
[1:24:29] and you'll stand here today and in the
[1:24:31] end when we have wisdom of what god is
[1:24:34] speaking to you and i
[1:24:35] we will look at that scripture and say
[1:24:37] amen to him
[1:24:39] because the power of almighty god comes
[1:24:41] on the scene
[1:24:43] each and every time when we think it is
[1:24:45] of the
[1:24:46] dire we're in dire straits
[1:24:50] god says i need to wait till shannon
[1:24:53] rak meshach and abednego
[1:24:59] i need to wait till they go into the
[1:25:00] furnace
[1:25:03] that's what i want to do because you see
[1:25:04] if i come down in a mighty hand
[1:25:07] as it were an uprising or a defense in
[1:25:10] the physical form
[1:25:13] then we'll say it was man
[1:25:17] but i'm going to let their heroes their
[1:25:18] great war heroes their great mighty
[1:25:21] soldiers the hardened men of warfare
[1:25:24] i'm going to let them die on the
[1:25:25] threshold
[1:25:28] and then i'm going to burn the ropes off
[1:25:30] of it oh my brother and sister
[1:25:33] the fire that we are afraid of is what
[1:25:36] brings our deliverance
[1:25:40] and when they're in the fire it burns
[1:25:42] the bombs from them
[1:25:43] and they stand there and god brings them
[1:25:46] out of that fire and says not not
[1:25:48] even the smell of that fire let me put
[1:25:50] it this way to you tonight
[1:25:52] not even the smell of that fiery trial
[1:25:56] that you are
[1:25:57] facing will reside on you when you come
[1:26:00] through this
[1:26:01] you say oh i i just seem to fall on my
[1:26:03] face and i had such a great struggle
[1:26:05] and things were so hard for me and i
[1:26:08] felt so
[1:26:08] so low and you come through that and god
[1:26:11] starts to move you again
[1:26:13] he starts to stir your soul reminding
[1:26:15] you i was with you all the time
[1:26:18] you would have fallen but i've been
[1:26:20] holding you up
[1:26:24] and you come through that trial you
[1:26:26] don't go on the rest of your life or you
[1:26:28] shouldn't anyway
[1:26:30] saying oh i had this horrible time when
[1:26:32] i was this age and
[1:26:33] it was terrible and i just don't even
[1:26:35] know how i made it through
[1:26:37] let those things be history you to let
[1:26:39] the smell of that fiery trial
[1:26:41] fade from you because to god it never
[1:26:44] even happened
[1:26:45] it was there to mold your character he
[1:26:48] doesn't keep a record
[1:26:49] well they fell down i had to lift him up
[1:26:51] oh they fell down and had them lift up
[1:26:53] you realize if god kept a diary like
[1:26:55] that what my diary would look like
[1:26:57] he fell down i lifted him up he fell
[1:26:59] down i lifted him up
[1:27:01] and it would be page after page after
[1:27:03] page of he fell down
[1:27:05] i lifted him up but i tell you my
[1:27:07] brother and sister
[1:27:08] god don't want you and i walking around
[1:27:10] saying i fell down i fell down i fell
[1:27:12] down i fell down i'm a failure
[1:27:14] i fell down god wants you to look at
[1:27:16] this and say
[1:27:17] i went through a fiery trial but there's
[1:27:19] not even
[1:27:21] one bit of the odor of that trial on me
[1:27:26] because i have come through this battle
[1:27:29] victorious
[1:27:30] the bonds have burned from me i have
[1:27:33] been delivered from this
[1:27:35] i know that god is my provider he's my
[1:27:38] keeper he is my all in all and i don't
[1:27:41] have to worry about it
[1:27:43] because i will not be forsaken and he
[1:27:46] will not leave me begging bread
[1:27:49] now my brother and sister we can go and
[1:27:50] i don't want to get too caught up in
[1:27:52] this
[1:27:52] but we can also take that in this
[1:27:54] spiritual realm right back into the
[1:27:56] spiritual realm
[1:27:57] of the word of god bring bread of life
[1:27:59] to you and i we will not end up the
[1:28:01] bride of christ
[1:28:02] we'll not be begging the bread trying to
[1:28:05] find
[1:28:05] the mind of god the word of god
[1:28:08] understanding of the word
[1:28:09] god promised it to you god will deliver
[1:28:12] it
[1:28:13] hallelujah can someone say hallelujah
[1:28:16] oh forgive me for getting excited
[1:28:20] amen says this is wisdoms of god out of
[1:28:24] man
[1:28:24] you know paul says you know i didn't
[1:28:26] come to you speaking enticing words of
[1:28:28] man's wisdom
[1:28:29] i come speaking to you of the power
[1:28:33] of the word the power of the life that
[1:28:36] is behind it is what i come speaking to
[1:28:39] you
[1:28:39] not enticing words to draw you to an
[1:28:42] idea
[1:28:45] oh my goodness lord let us be focused on
[1:28:48] your word
[1:28:50] now look five definite identifications
[1:28:54] the true church of the living god
[1:28:57] now i just pulled this quote out of here
[1:28:59] because it it just
[1:29:00] hit my fancy but i plan on listening or
[1:29:04] reading this sermon
[1:29:07] let's let the bible say it then is that
[1:29:09] good enough for us
[1:29:11] let us turn now and read a while turn
[1:29:13] with me to revelation 17th chapter this
[1:29:15] is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:29:17] to his church church called out
[1:29:21] you wonder why the rest of the world
[1:29:22] don't put the significance that you put
[1:29:24] on this
[1:29:25] because they weren't called out they're
[1:29:27] called to stay right there in mystery
[1:29:29] babylon they're called to
[1:29:31] keep that connection open keep that
[1:29:33] relationship
[1:29:34] fresh well our relationship fresh is
[1:29:36] with our lord jesus christ
[1:29:38] not with a system amen i can take you
[1:29:41] right
[1:29:41] if it matters to you i can take you
[1:29:43] right where the prophet of god said
[1:29:45] the minute you even go back to that uh
[1:29:48] spirit of denomination it's dead
[1:29:52] dead right there oh my so we don't have
[1:29:55] to go spend years
[1:29:57] we don't have to form a denomination
[1:29:58] around this message we just have to get
[1:30:00] that spirit around
[1:30:01] and it'll kill the spirit of god
[1:30:04] church called out revelation 17 and
[1:30:06] we'll try to make this just quick as
[1:30:07] possible let that be prophetic
[1:30:09] but now watch as we read they're coming
[1:30:11] to me one of the seven angels which had
[1:30:13] seven vials and talked me saying come
[1:30:15] hither and i'll show you
[1:30:16] the judgment of the great that
[1:30:17] sitteth upon many waters now this is all
[1:30:20] symbolized
[1:30:21] because it is a revelation of jesus
[1:30:25] christ
[1:30:26] sealed up
[1:30:29] now if that remains sealed up how is it
[1:30:33] that you
[1:30:34] have wisdom of it
[1:30:39] now see this is the this is the tricky
[1:30:41] part
[1:30:42] to that man it's sealed
[1:30:47] to you it's open
[1:30:50] so the prophetic word could be placed in
[1:30:53] this manifestation
[1:30:56] the seventh seal is closed
[1:31:00] the seventh seal is opened
[1:31:05] because to this man i'm not pointing it
[1:31:08] to anyone in particular
[1:31:10] this man it's closed
[1:31:13] and he won't think of anything else so
[1:31:16] it being closed now
[1:31:17] affects his entire relationship with the
[1:31:20] word of god
[1:31:21] in fact it affects the entire prophetic
[1:31:24] relationship of the message of the hour
[1:31:27] with him and the man that is here
[1:31:30] saying god has given me wisdom god has
[1:31:32] given me knowledge and we're not talking
[1:31:34] about boastful
[1:31:35] uh claiming we're talking about the
[1:31:37] reality of it and a man standing there
[1:31:39] saying the word of god has been open to
[1:31:41] me
[1:31:41] the knowledge of god has been open to me
[1:31:44] and i am here and the seal
[1:31:46] which is jesus christ has been made real
[1:31:49] to me
[1:31:51] you see they're going to have two
[1:31:52] entirely different views of the message
[1:31:55] they're going to have two entirely
[1:31:56] different approaches to the word of the
[1:31:59] hour
[1:31:59] because one is declaring part of the
[1:32:01] word is closed
[1:32:03] and one is saying i am the bride of
[1:32:05] christ and he has held out the scepter
[1:32:07] and said anything you want to the half
[1:32:09] of my kingdom because you're my other
[1:32:12] half
[1:32:12] you fit into the half by half because
[1:32:15] you
[1:32:16] are the other half i claimed you and you
[1:32:18] claim me
[1:32:19] and you fit perfectly into me
[1:32:24] come hither i'll show you the judgment
[1:32:26] of the great horse sitting on many
[1:32:27] waters
[1:32:28] now this all symbolized because the
[1:32:30] revelation of jesus christ
[1:32:32] sealed up do you know that it is a
[1:32:34] hidden thing
[1:32:35] and only can be revealed not by the
[1:32:38] intellectual mind
[1:32:40] now look where this revelation my
[1:32:41] brother and sister people say well why
[1:32:43] do you think it's open to you
[1:32:45] read this now it is a hidden thing and
[1:32:47] only can be revealed
[1:32:49] not by the intellectual mind we can't
[1:32:52] build a chart
[1:32:53] we can't build a graph we can't take
[1:32:55] walls of paper
[1:32:56] and write it all out and make a call a
[1:33:00] logical conclusion
[1:33:03] because it is a revelation of jesus
[1:33:07] christ
[1:33:08] sealed up did you know that it is a
[1:33:11] hidden thing
[1:33:11] and only can be revealed not by the
[1:33:14] intellectual mind
[1:33:15] but revealed by the holy spirit through
[1:33:18] the gifts of
[1:33:19] the spirit this is my brother and sister
[1:33:22] if i can make this point tonight
[1:33:23] i hope by god's grace i can do you
[1:33:26] realize that god has come to you and i
[1:33:29] young people he's come to you and i
[1:33:31] bearing gifts
[1:33:33] we all know what it's like to have
[1:33:35] someone bearing gifts to us
[1:33:37] someone comes here's a gift for you it's
[1:33:39] got
[1:33:40] your name on it amen your sister
[1:33:43] your brother your cousin nephew uncle
[1:33:46] dad mom
[1:33:47] they got no right to claim that gift
[1:33:50] it's got your name on it so god
[1:33:53] is not coming and just throwing this
[1:33:55] gift out to the church
[1:33:57] god come to you individually bearing
[1:34:00] this gift of the revelation of himself
[1:34:05] oh hallelujah revealed by the holy
[1:34:07] spirit through the gifts of the spirit
[1:34:08] to him that has wisdom
[1:34:10] let him count the numbers of the beast
[1:34:12] now look my brother and sister this
[1:34:14] part here that is laying out is there
[1:34:18] in such a way look at this to him
[1:34:21] that has wisdom the gift of wisdom let
[1:34:24] him do this and let him do that
[1:34:25] and this is the revelation now any note
[1:34:29] one knows that when a woman is
[1:34:30] symbolized in the bible
[1:34:32] it pertains to a church christ church is
[1:34:35] called the bride paul said
[1:34:36] i espouse you to christ as a chaste
[1:34:39] virgin
[1:34:40] in other words not a church that's
[1:34:42] dabbled in this and
[1:34:44] dabbled in that not a church that holds
[1:34:47] to this
[1:34:48] off the word and holds to this on the
[1:34:50] word
[1:34:51] and comes and says but the balance of it
[1:34:55] we're christians no chaste virgin
[1:34:59] in other words she presents herself
[1:35:02] i've only been in your word i'm clothed
[1:35:06] in your word hallelujah
[1:35:10] i hope you i hope you're on board
[1:35:12] tonight
[1:35:15] espouse you to christ the chaste version
[1:35:17] now here we're speaking a great woman
[1:35:18] who is an ill feigned woman come hither
[1:35:20] and i'll show you said the angel to john
[1:35:21] the judgment of the great horror that
[1:35:23] sets upon many waters now a woman
[1:35:25] sitting upon many waters
[1:35:26] sounds very mystic but it's all here
[1:35:29] the bible explains it
[1:35:33] we have something like 12
[1:35:36] 000 recognized religions
[1:35:43] but the bible explains it
[1:35:49] somewhere along there there has to be
[1:35:51] some wisdom and knowledge come
[1:35:53] to understand what it's explaining
[1:35:57] hallelujah it takes a gift of the holy
[1:36:00] ghost
[1:36:01] to see the whole picture sister emmy
[1:36:03] would you come
[1:36:05] hallelujah let's just sing that little
[1:36:08] song the word is working mightily
[1:36:10] in me amen i'll tell you what my brother
[1:36:13] and sister it's a word that's going to
[1:36:14] change us
[1:36:15] it ain't going to be what church we
[1:36:16] belong to it ain't be what kind of
[1:36:18] friends we got
[1:36:20] you know by god's grace and i just say
[1:36:22] this to make a point by god's grace
[1:36:24] brother george and i have have a few
[1:36:26] things in common
[1:36:28] and you know brother braham said that
[1:36:32] brother george had the holy ghost so
[1:36:34] me knowing brother george must mean that
[1:36:36] i'm rubbing shoulders with the holy
[1:36:37] ghost
[1:36:39] that won't work it won't matter how good
[1:36:42] a friend
[1:36:45] i got to get it myself we have to hold

[1:36:54] of what we lack and what we need and and
[1:36:57] what is happening around us wisdom
[1:36:59] will give us revelation and we will not

[1:37:03] the ones sitting there on that day
[1:37:05] saying please sell me

[1:37:45] talking to this one
[1:37:47] no it'll eliminate that knowledge
[1:37:50] that wisdom will eliminate all the
[1:37:53] doubts of who
[1:37:55] we are and we can lift a hand and say
[1:37:58] thank you lord

[1:39:08] bit gathered right now

[1:39:15] a lot of years ago when i first heard a
[1:39:17] brother preach
[1:39:18] that the rapture was taking place right
[1:39:21] now
[1:39:22] oh i remember i was so suspicious
[1:39:26] i i could have called scotland yard and
[1:39:28] the pinkertons and the fbi and said
[1:39:30] investigate this
[1:39:32] instead i wrote a big old note right on
[1:39:34] my notes right there
[1:39:36] and i put a great big check and that
[1:39:38] meant check this out
[1:39:41] and i realized that's it the rapture is
[1:39:44] a body change
[1:39:46] and thank you lord i'm being changed
[1:39:49] right here
[1:39:50] right now it's not an event to look out
[1:39:54] there somewhere but he is
[1:39:57] changing us oh hallelujah
[1:40:01] my i can only imagine how enoch must
[1:40:04] have felt that day when he was walking
[1:40:07] you know there's way too much of this
[1:40:09] marvel comic world we live in
[1:40:11] and they've got the uh what do they call
[1:40:14] them the avengers or the something like
[1:40:16] that
[1:40:16] and and you know he's a guy walking
[1:40:18] along and all of a sudden
[1:40:19] you know something pops out of the top
[1:40:21] of his head and this flops this way and
[1:40:22] that flops that way and he turns into
[1:40:24] some armor-plated guy to go fight for
[1:40:26] good or
[1:40:27] evil well my brother and sister
[1:40:32] i'm not being changed like that
[1:40:36] it's the same old me what you see is
[1:40:38] what you get

[1:40:45] but the change is happening
[1:40:50] and there's days that i feel like i
[1:40:52] failed the lord
[1:40:54] and god comes along and says hmm
