that seed is christ amen amen amen it's the seed that he's taken in the rapture amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of god tonight i have a little and thank you you guys you can be dismissed i appreciate it went right along with the sermon brother jason amen amen i appreciate the way the lord works and think things that he does you know the original life of the original seed the original seed is the spoken word amen you were always were in that word amen you were his thought amen tonight i want to bring a little subject here that's that's expanded into more than one sermon and uh lord willing i want to break it down i feel very led to do that i don't know how often or how many times i'm going to be able to get to it but i mean in the series but i don't know how long it'll take i want to title this here in his love here in if you want all that's spelled that's h-e-r-e-i-n here in is love it means in this or in in this it's his love herein is love and the subject or the subtitle or the subject tonight i want to cover in this part one is where was thou and i'd like you to turn with me to job the 38th chapter amen we just uh appreciate i see brother manasseh god bless you brother and for being here and brothers others that made it wednesday's kind of tough but i always know that you kind of have to press through barriers and pressures to get here on a wednesday and and i appreciate it and that's no disrespect brother paul i know he's under a lot of pressure so and i know he would have been here if he could have been so i realized there's times when you can't and it's just but god knows all things doesn't he and he said all things work together for good to them that love god so that's uh that's a certainty how many know the word is a certainty you don't have a right to put your opinion on it what you think about it don't try to mix feelings with it the word is certain before we read let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father we rejoice in your mercy and grace that you bestowed upon us for this day and hour that we can walk in the light for this is the message god is light and in him is no darkness at all we thank you lord that we're able to walk in light being predestinated by you to walk therein lord who's going to say it's not so how many mistakes or failures are going to speak to us say it's not so they're lying vanities we know that you are the i am and we are the i am in you and so lord we are thankful that we can we can speak these things and not just by emotion not by some uh emotional outbreak but lord by revelation and we're thankful for revelation father as your prophet said it can never be over emphasize the revelation of the word and so lord we thank you for this and we certainly every day you said you would impart to us what we have need of and you said your mercy is new every morning and i can certainly say through the many many years of serving you lord by your grace that your mercy is new every morning and so father your faithfulness is great we commit this service to you we commit the words that are spoken the thoughts i ask you to reveal yourself to those that have ears to hear and able to receive for thy glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen if you'd stand with me i think we can stand with the reading of the word job 38 and i'll begin with verse 3. god's speaking to job out of a whirlwind and he says in verse 3 gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it where upon are the foundations there of fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god you notice all the sons of god shouted for joy amen i want to read you can be seated i'll just open up with that but i want you to turn to first john and i want to go to the fifth or fourth chapter of first john now we took that title our subject out of that 38th chapter of verse 4 of job it said where was thou that's the question with all of you tonight or other words where were you when he laid the foundations of the earth where were you you'll get the revelation of where you are it's going to show you where you come from who you are and where you're going that's right would you like to know that that ought to settle it forever if you know where you come from amen then you know who you are and if you know who you are you know where you're going you can't miss it there's no way to miss it because i'm going to tell you right now that revelation is god's achievement it's nothing you've done or could do it's god's achievement so in first john 4 let's start with verse 4 ye are of god little children wow you are of god you know that's an eternal he's eternal there's only one form of eternal life and that's god and you are of god now how are you going to fail you say i fail every day but yeah there's a part of you does fail but there's a part that god doesn't see the failure the other part can't the eternal part of you can't fail the inside of the inside man the third man can't fail i say it like that because brother branham said that inside man amen are you with me he said you said in one place the third man amen all right so he said here you are of god little children now see see there's the word right there everybody can read it but can they hear it everybody can read that same word and hear it with the ears the voice of god the word is the voice but can you receive it can you hear it there's only one group of people one group in this earth today that can hear that word and hear this scripture and that's the bride amen amen you are of god little children and have overcome them who are them antichrist antichrist spirit you have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world i want to jump down here to verse 7. you can read the whole chapter later but i just want to get to these points here as i said this is just the beginning verse 7 but i'm going to lay this out as the foundation of what we're going to speak on here not only tonight beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god this love we're speaking of tonight is not filial it's divine and we're going to find out as we go on further here for love is of god it said verse 8 he that loveth not see he that loveth is born of god amen born of god so if you're born of god you are of god he begat you you had to be in him for him to begat you amen because you're his son what makes you a son that's seed land there that's been quickened that becomes flesh amen that's son that's god the son that's you yourself that's god in you that's of god are you with me all right now so we say see so we come down the eighth verse he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us in this in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him now who was he he was god himself in some form do you believe that he was god the son amen are you with me all right that was himself that was the fullness of the godhead bodily in one man that's our redeemer that's our savior that was god himself that was the blood of god that was shed there for you all right then he would be everything god was wouldn't he so let's read that again in this was manifest the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world this love was begotten toward us that we might live through him herein herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins what's he redeeming here what's he what's he dying for himself his sons his offspring his bride amen all right beloved or excuse me let's go let's go over here to verse 13. hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit there you are how do you what do you how are you going to know that you're in him and he's in you he's placed to giving you the token the token is your assurance that the price has been paid for you you have the token now what's going to keep you out of it what's going to keep you out of everything they purchase for you what's going to keep you from claiming it what's going to keep you from having it nothing apply the token to place the token with your prayer satan has to move why because it's his life it's his love and keep this in mind through these this series that love never faileth we're talking about god's own love we're talking about agape love not filial but agape love amen the capstone love all right now in verse 16 and we have known and believed the love that god hath given to us and we have known and believed the love that god hath given to who well he's love what have we received himself then the love that god has given to us when he gave us his spirit he's given us his love all right then god has given to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love not dwelleth with love but dwelleth in love dwelleth in god hallelujah what a place of safety you think any plague is going to come now you're dwelling you see the bible said no plague can come now you're dwelling your dwelling is christ this house is his dwelling but your dwelling is christ amen you may have all kinds ups and downs and and failures and struggles and trials in this but that word in you can never move it can't be moved you believe that the word cannot be moved you're planted like a tree beside the waters shall not be moved what is that tree who is that tree it's the bride tree what is the bride tree the tree of life in bright form all right i don't want to get too far going on these things because i would be i just have one page of notes but i got some things i want to share with you brother branham said here further it'll be a little bit of reading tonight so just bear with me but verse 16. okay i dwelleth and growleth god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect here it is our love made mature that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is because as he is because as he is so are we in this world so are we amen there is no fear in love but perfect love matured love complete perfect matured love casteth out fear because fear because fear hath torment he that feareth see perfect love there's only one perfect love and no you cannot enter that dimension amen of where he saw those saints caught up in their theophany amen without perfect love because nothing was there but perfect love so you see what we're doing by feeding on the word for the hour don't you and taking and reading your bible without the message you would know what's in this bible for the hour you wouldn't be able to receive it that's the truth or he would have never had to send a prophet with the interpretation of what god was saying for this season and show it in the word amen so thank god for a prophet a vindicated prophet amen and he that will not believe that prophet doesn't have the love of god in his heart that's right that's exactly right amen because he had the word he was the word he was the word for our day he didn't deviate from this word that's what identified him amen and if you can't believe this neither will you believe the prophet's words and if you can't believe the prophet's word you won't accept this either amen that's right we're not talking about just a man we're talking about the word that's come in our day the son of man revealing himself through a son of man okay so who are we believing the son of man and what are we manifesting the son of man that's what we're here on earth to manifest that's what we're here on earth to fulfill himself in bride form that's the end time message that's the message of his coming amen because without that you won't meet him you've got to have this spiritual union you must have it in faith before you have it in reality full reality you've got to meet him now or you'll never meet him there you've got to be married now you'll never be married there you see what i'm saying versus spiritual the revelation of the word always takes revelation it takes faith you must know him by that means you must have your healing by that means all of that works by faith all we do is by faith as believers amen all right so so we see here he said he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen the prophet says here i'll just pass this note to you there's two different kinds of love kind of mentioned that already but one of them is the greek word filio filio means friendship also means a human love or friendship love the kind you have for your wife love that kind of love that kind of love is not a true love amen but if you're married to your wife and she gets a little upset with you or you get upset with her or she gets upset with you love will cover it that's not human there's another love there if your love is based on the on the union because god revealed to you this is my eternal mate she's mine and i'm her hers is are you with me then that's going to hold you that's going to be a love that covers over that other love that love won't that feeling won't hold out it's got condition that's right it'll you know like brother branham went on to say he said and i know you little teenagers want to believe that filio is a true love but that's wrong that kind of love will make you jealous of your wife you'll take a pistol and blow a man's brains out because of her well i don't think a christian would do that but you'd get pretty upset wouldn't you irritated if somebody come along and did that to my wife but what would agape love do it would what would that do it'll get down and pray for that man's lost soul because that felio ain't real love amen amen all right but agape love will get you down and pray for that man's soul forgive him speak to him see see it says says that's agape love that's the kind of love the church needs what we all need is that kind of love god give me that love all right ephesians chapter one now if we don't do any more than read the scriptures at all say amen and go home this evening because that's worth every bit of it i'm not i can't explain you can't explain revelation but we speak it and we're expecting god to reveal it and he'll do so through his word god operates and lives in and dwells in his word he's obligated to his word amen all right so ephesians chapter one verse four very familiar scriptures but we can read scriptures over and over again and get something more new every time and quicken to you we can take a message oh well i've heard that message before i've read that message i don't need to read that again yes you do you need to keep feeding on that message because i'll tell you what it keeps opening amen why because the word of god is eternal amen that's right not the word of a man the word of god is eternal so according at verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath hath past tense blessed us with all spiritual blessings all spiritual blessings in look at the positioning here in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us half past tense you didn't choose him he chose you in him where'd he choose you in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us predestinated us unto the adoption or positioning adoption is placing or positioning of that son of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will not your will his will not human will his will all right to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted he hath made us accepted in the beloved verse 9 having made known unto us us the mystery of his will amen are you with me he he he he adopted us as children according good pleasure of his will having made known to us the mystery of his will according that's what the message of the hour has done is made us prepared and ready for a body change by unveiling his will to us individually personally all right then having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself all right now we're getting into something he has purposed this in himself you didn't purpose it amen he purposed it it's his achievement it's his doing he made the choice you remember the elect are elect according to foreknowledge are you with me elect according to foreknowledge that's that's his that's his doing you didn't make that choice he made that choice amen when he made the choice and you come up to have the choice you made it because you ordained to make that choice because he chose you but you had a choice are you with me but how are you going to go contrary to what you did in him to begin with then he would be defeated but he still gave you a choice amen he chose you that you might choose him that sounds like a riddle doesn't it but that's right okay now having made known a pleasure good purpose with yet purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times we are in those times right now we're in that place he might gather together in one how's he going to do it by opening the seven seals because we're looking the opening of the seven seals was the notation or the realization that we're in the fullness of time we're in that dispensation we're at the end all right we've arrived he said we've come we've come to that place when that moment is i don't know but we're in the end time right now we're in the end all right so there had to be a fullness of jesus christ revealed and that had to come through the opening of seven seals you'd have no fullness of the word so it's very important that we eat the open book because right in that open book is your identification because you are the open book you are the open book amen you are the reveal revelation of himself when he was here on earth in the fullness of god revealing god he revealed you is that right he was revealing you because you were in him and all that he was was being unfolded revealed and when he unveiled himself and revealed god revealed himself in some form that was you there so but my but my question is to you is where was thou before the when he laid the foundation of the earth because in the beginning was the word is that right in the beginning was the spoken word the spoken word is the original seed in the beginning was the word that's original in the beginning god the word created heavens and earth laid the foundations but where were you amen that's right where were you your attitude towards the word your attitude towards the word for this hour denotes where you were either you long for more of him or you're just coming to church because it's a duty and not a love affair amen are you with me why do we sit down and feed on the word because we love him why do you believe him because you love him amen outside of that where's real faith real faith is is working by love okay so so we come down here and he said let's continue on in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one not in two not in three and one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right in whom we have obtained an inheritance i see if i have that mark because i was moving okay verse 7 verse 17. now let's see wait a minute now 9-10 okay yeah just to verse 10 there yeah and then i want to go to chapter 3. verse 3 how that by revelation now paul said you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word to you word is to you the individual how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery by revelation that's god's way that's god's purpose by revelation abel offered to god his excellent sacrifice then his brother cain they were both religious they both believed god they both were making building a church they were both worshiping but god didn't accept all that he accepted revelation and that was because of the difference of the seed so the evidence of the seed is that they'll receive the word by revelation all right so he said here he said whereby and we come verse 3 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery and then verse 16. that he would grant to you i i bypassed a lot right there but let's just get over here to verse 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man in the inner man verse 17 that christ may dwell in you by that christ may dwell now i'm trusting the lord will make this re start to reveal these things to you that christ may dwell in your hearts where where in your hearts you realize that in your heart you have another realm it's called the soul in that spirit realm there's another's third circle isn't there the heart is the spirit amen but in there is a soul amen all right that's the inner man he's speaking of here that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you may that you being rooted and grounded that ye being rooted rooted you just weren't put out you were rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth the length and the depth and height and to know the love of christ verse 19 and to know not imagine not something well i hope it's so but faith is the substance substance of things hoped for it's substance you say well i i hope i get what i'm hoping for i hope i get the word see let's promise me but i hope i get it no it's not hope you get it if it's revealed to you it's yours it's substance you have the substance of the thing hoped for you've already got it what are you waiting for the full the full revelation the full realization the full manifestation of what you have in faith must be manifested completely if i believed i was healed then i'd start rejoicing for my healing i'd start confessing that faith and my body would obey my confession it's got to be manifest why because faith has taken the word and faith is the channel that god manifests his word through amen all right so verse 19 again and to know the love of christ to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god as we said prophet said in the message things that are to be and that's paragraph 42 he said he said the fullness of the word come into existence by the opening of those seven seals that was promised to us in this age that we then can understand amen amen so see he laid everything else in order but there's something that had to be brought as a capstone message that would cap the whole thing amen and that had to be god himself unveiling himself and who is he love right all right now i'd like you to go with me to hebrews 10. that's a lot of reading i realize but i'm laying all this down in part one in verse 10 we may come back to it probably will in different times but hebrews chapter 10 verse 5. remember my subject herein is love or my title excuse me my subject says where was thou wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou woodest not but a body hast thou prepared me amen now in the church age book i have some things i want to share with you here in different places and it won't be long in the church age book and if you want to follow along it's in the older book it's in the blue book and that's on page 354 i'm reading from and we'll probably come back to this other times but the scripture says in revelation 3 19 and i'll read you don't turn to it as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous thereof and repent brother branham comes down he says let's examine the first phrase as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say as many would feel that he should say he does not say what many feel he should say as many as love me no sir no sir and he says i said no sir we must never try to make jesus now listen to this carefully we must never try to make jesus the object of human love we must never make jesus the object of human love what is human love it is an agape love it's filial all right you must never make jesus the object of human love that a lot of people go around say i love jesus i love jesus but i won't accept his word well i love jesus but i can't accept the message of a prophet well i love jesus but i go to church i'm good enough and it's a loose term i love him i love him i love him not questioning the love it's a true statement but unless you have god in you how do you how can you say you love him unless she first loved you and if he first loved you where were you when he laid the foundations of the earth amen you see we wouldn't have all this open i thank god again for a message of the hour that's opened these mysteries have been sealed in this word never would we have come to that knowledge or knowledge being revelation true understanding of what god had hid here for us that was laying in us ready to be opened where were we where what are we we're part of this word that's why when the eagle heard the scream something screamed inside of him that's what i've been listening for hear the voice but being an eagle he was able to receive the voice of an eagle because he knew the voice why did he know the voice because before he became an eagle in a barnyard he was an eagle in another eagle are you with me amen all right then how's he going to turn down his father's voice when he always was a part of his father and his father-in-law wanted fellowship with him or his mother looking for him and when he heard that scream something inside of him responded to that and when he heard it he looked up he didn't look down he looked up he was taught to look down but he looked up he was taught to look at his failures and his faults and his mistakes and his failures instead he looked up beyond that and said there's what i want to begin with begin to dawn on amen the sun is up begins to dawn on you it is the rising of the sun amen amen thy light has come bride thy light thy light is come amen there's darkness in the world there's gross darkness upon the people you can see it is they're going insane they're going to they're fanatical they're in every way they're they don't know what to do they don't know whether i seen a guy i said it was a guy that was a guy or a girl sitting in a car he had a ponytail shaved all over but he had enough hair to have a ponytail up here this way and the ponytail back here this way i said he doesn't know who he is you know what it is a terrible case of amnesia they don't know how to identify themselves they don't know whether they're man or woman they don't even they can't even begin to identify who they are it's amnesia and it's really unless unless it's predestinated seed it's incurable but to the bride thank god he brought us back to where we were in the beginning amen where we were in the beginning that's a great revelation where were you when i laid the foundations up there where was you i've got to hurry i didn't think i'd have to hurry anyway okay so he said you can't make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it's not the object of human love but he said i love he said no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours praise the lord it's his love and question not ours amen so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation his purpose and his plan we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of sovereignty of god even as it said in romans 9 13 jacob i loved see does it now not does it now obtain that since he loved only the many he is therefore a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh to him by no means is this so for he declared also in romans 9 13 esau have i hated so he made a differentiation there he said jacob i loved he saw i hate and we know why he said why jacob alone was the seed jacob had the seed though he was a shyster and esau was a better moral man outwardly esau did better works but they weren't being judged on human merit amen god didn't accept human merit he says right here he said he said in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of god according to election so how did he love us first i loved i as many as i love what is that in elective love why because of where you were to begin with he knew you he didn't know he saw but he knew you he knew jacob amen you say well he knew all things i'm not talking about that kind of knowing i'm talking about knew you intimately knew you you were in him a part of him you were in the eternal thought of himself god had eternal thoughts we know he's eternal so those if they're eternal thoughts they had to be a part of him amen there's only one form of eternal he knew all things he knew who would be here he knew what what you do he knew he created all things but not all were his seed not all was himself i didn't have anything to do with that neither did you so i can't boast of knowing doing anything of good or evil i can't boast of myself or my works i boast in his love and grace to me to call me to himself despite myself despite my failures despite my heirs despise everything else he chose me amen amen to be his he chose me to be his dwelling place um that kind of jumped way all right now he said so he said that purpose of god according to election might stand he said not of works not of works satan has always taken you around the bush by works if you fail works he's right there to condemn you you did this you did that i say you're talking to the wrong man because i have a i am a resurrected son of god raised from the dead passed from death unto life and you can't pin those works on me because i never did them to begin with i'm justified as though i'd never done it amen he justified you you didn't justify yourself he declared you righteous because you were in him always to be eternal you didn't come into him somewhere you always were in him and you could never leave him because eternity can't end it never had a start that didn't have an end can we we can't fathom that in our little finite mental minds but something in our hearts says that's right amen amen all right so so he says it's not of works but him by but of him that calleth the love is elective love it is his love for his elect it is his love for his elect you didn't earn it you can't earn it amen that's right and we believe in good works but good work should show your faith in christ are you with me faith with how works is dead because if you really believe god you'll act like you do if you really believe you're healed you go to acting like you're healed the works declares the faith and if you really love him your works will declare you'd love him amen he loved you did not his works declared that he loved you sure did he died for you he gave his life for you he he shed his life for you he made the redemption for the price of you when you were a sinner no good deadbeat he took he took your penalty he took the chastisement of your peace he took your sickness he took your sin and bore it in his body and we were in him bearing the judgment he took the judgment for sin in his body you were judged right there and because he rose again sealed that judgment you could never come back into a christian a real believer can't die he's resurrected how can he die when he's already risen i'm not talking about the human part this will rise again how many believe that you go in the grave this will rise again because he's already bought it it's his it's his own it can't come up like this but it'll come up because sin can't rise unbelief can't rise mistakes and failures will never rise again once they're dead they're gone period that's it but this body will rise again because quickening power is in it amen all right now okay so he said then then his love for us is apart from human merit the purpose of god the purpose of god stands in election that is opposite to works or anything man has in himself amen all right in the same book page 149 we look at these these things here in church age book trying to i'm trying to get down to this and i've got just a few more minutes here so 149. now these are familiar quotes but as i said we read and we reread and we read and we reread and somewhere it just quickens and keeps coming alive i may experience that absolutely it's revelation god unveiling unfolding eternity unfolding your eternity unfolding did you hear me say that right you are eternity unfolding i'm talking about that real you the born again you see without being born again you'll never be able to hear the word for the season that's right because you have the teacher come in to teach it to discern it to receive it because he said i will lead you i will guide you into all truth when he the comforters come he will lead you into all truth without him you can't come there okay so we'll never always put emphasis on the new birth but you grow after that you have to grow in the stature because that new birth that new creation that new you a new race his own race the revelation of himself grows into his stature into a completeness into a capping when you receive the holy ghost you receive the seal it's not the seal up there it's the positioning you're positioned and that capstone is there it comes down brother brandon made it very clear when you receive the baptism the holy ghost that is the new birth amen amen okay we can spend a lot of time in that i'll touch just briefly on it here tonight but on page 149 the heart purpose i love this i love this quote the heart purpose of god can you imagine the heart purpose of god here we are going into the very heart purpose where were you going into the very heart purpose of god for coming into the heart purpose the eternal purpose he said not only is that the heart purpose it's the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing well i sure wouldn't have chose brother david but he did i'm talking about the real brother david he did amen he chose you well i'm not good enough that's what the devil will tell you but he just he just we just read here he's not looking at that whether you're good enough or not if that's the case jacob would have been thrown out because he wasn't good enough he was a deceiver smile now you know that's the truth he deceived his daddy deceived his brother but he had to have that birthright he was a finigler he was a good jew he wanted the birthright i want the riches i want the right god said i honored that that was something beyond jacob because that was the type of the birth the new birth we have the birthright anybody here with the birthright to all god owns well you're so rich you're beyond what you even you may be as poor as a pauper but like i am but you're rich amen beyond what you can imagine amen all right so he says here he says that was a bride of his own choosing that's his eternal purpose his heart purpose that choose a bride of his own choosing his own choosing and that purpose can you imagine god chose you by his own choosing amazing he chose you by his own choosing he said he hears his own choosing and he says the heart purpose was the zone choosing and that purpose was in himself nobody else involved in this it's himself creator of heavens and earth author of life giver of every good gift he chose you was in himself and being eternal him being eternal was decreed this was already decreed before the foundation before the foundation of the world think of that he wasn't he wasn't worried about who was going to hear it he decreed it he decreed himself i'll be this i'll be him he'll preach behind the pulpit on this certain day and this is i've i've chosen him i've chose her i've chose him i've chose arabic and they're going to accept my word and they won't be satisfied until they meet me in themselves till they have that birth they know that they know they pass from death into life and then they'll start growing they'll start growing in the stature they'll start growing up into the very into my very being into my merry self love that's who i am amen all right and he says before god was god before other words before god was an object of worship before god was god god is an object of war adoration no one else there to worship him so it so he's only at that time potentially god when he decreed it and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind already and you thought you just come around and i have such a problem every day why because you're discerning yourself by your mistakes and your ups and your downs and how you feel and how you don't feel and i don't feel like this and i don't feel like that must be something wrong with you who are you judging that by his word he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even in you i'll direct you i'll guide you i'll lead you into all truth i've healed your body i've made every oh lord meet my need he said well i've done it just reading such and such a scripture here and i've already met it what are you going to do about it you're going to accept it amen it's the amen it's the end of all strife his word is your absolute all right then he said the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing it wasn't just well this is a nice thought it's the thought no she was existing she was eternal and she was existing in his very thoughts of himself the eternal the thoughts of the eternal and he said and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal sure they are you can't be thinking of himself and not be eternal thoughts hallelujah where were you if you can see this he said you will see many things if you can see this you will see many things god is unchangeable amen i could go on and on here the thoughts of god are eternal they are real he never had another thought about you he doesn't have a new thought about you what he had in his mind about you and about being himself and about his choosing about being his bride has never changed it's never wavered it's not based on your marriage it's not based on nothing you are free you are released i wonder the devil thought me so hard about getting this out today tried to chew my lip up i bumped it down i got a sharp tooth there and about he said i'll get him i'll keep him from talking then he made my eye my eye it looks like it may be a little watered up or something i said lord this is your eyes they haven't bothered me yet so amen see you challenge the devil back you say well you challenge yeah you take the word that's your absolute well i don't feel like it i must not have my healing it doesn't based on what you feel it's based on the word you don't add to it what you feel you don't reason with it you take it you apply it you have the token to apply it if you're born again you have the token filled with himself he's dwelling in you you have the token to apply the word you apply the blood you can apply the blood not only you say it was the blood of god it was your blood too not human blood and yet it was a human but it was his blood and if that blood is is is his blood then you are set completely free there's no more condemnation when you've come through that blood nothing can come through that blood but himself but his life but his own life his own love that love and life work together their light when they're expressed that's light and you are the light okay these elect are the eternal thoughts of god and were to be decreed and expressed in flesh in their due seasons this is your season to rise and shine this is your season amen we're here to manifest our position the bride's position is to manifest jesus christ in bride form we're manifesting this message we are this message we are the message of the open book you are the people of the open book amen all right so you're the seed so he says he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that means we were right with him in his mind we were with him in his mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that where were you then he just answered it all right he was the he in his season he was the complete thought expressed and in your season you're that thought expressed that portion that measure that you have my brother has a measure this has a measure he's a god of variety nobody can preach like me not even chris nobody i'm not a good preacher i'm not saying that but what i'm saying nobody can take my place i can't take his place he can't take my preacher that preachers what about the housewives it's just as important as an apostle or a prophet the prophet said you have a ministry you're not taking it serious enough you're anointed to your ministry and a husband ought to recognize it that's your ministry you know that you're anointed to your ministry to do your ministry if it was going to be on the time spent my wife has a greater reward than i do she's ministering every single day sometimes even in the night she's ministering was she ministering to her home her family her husband as she serves her husband she serves god did you know that is that strange to you that's the word amen god's looking at it that way you see all right what's my purpose to do feed the sheep serve my household amen serve her i love her my my my work is to love her as christ loved his body and real marriage is going to express that exactly right amen and the wife is going to have respect and reverence for her husband why because the bride has respect in her or her her husband amen then the husband ought to lead a i'd live a certain life that he can be respected amen that's right i don't know how i got on that but i'm but it's still where were you here in is love talking about it all right now you are chosen of god those who are royal seed the elect of god are the predestinated foreign of god and we're in the mind of god and in his thoughts plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally not expressed okay i've already been through it i won't go any further than that he said it was very apparent that she be called that see spoken word bride she's a spoken word seed bride because she's expressed and he said and she's expressing what the word she's always been a part of the word she was a part of the word to begin with where were you in the word it was already clear when he laid the foundation had been spoken things were beginning to manifest manifest where were you in there in that word amen all right so he said here he said so he so she was predestinated him she came from the same source that our lord came from amen the son are you with me you've come from the same source was eternal with him and let this mind be in you as it was in our lord jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god amen are you with me we're not above him but we're equal that's the mind of god that's the mind of god not the mind of the flesh you're trying to make up somebody look at i i'm god no you're not you're just a lump of clay but that inside man who you are the real you is the spirit of god and that's what we operate by i have no confidence in this but i've got all the confidence in the world of that unveiled word that i am that's him in me jesus knew who he was and he operated on that faith because faith takes this resting place in the eternal unmovable word of god hallelujah all right so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh let me read that again we eternal in his thoughts in our turn our season here now became the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn you must have the seed to be reborn remember that spirit can be anointed you can do all those things but you can't receive the word for your season the word's not there but you can do all the rest of it you can be anointed to shout and dance and speak in tongues and prophesy balaam was and balaam prophesied right but he couldn't receive the word god revealed his perfect will and he wouldn't accept it all right we go right down the line with them what about esau what about what about judas amen he couldn't stay in the word when it went up to receive life he couldn't receive life no more than cain could receive life wrong seed it's the seed that tells the difference amen all right now only the elect can be reborn because the because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened what's the quickening of the seed the word living in you the revelation of jesus christ amen that's who you are all right he said we're seed the reason we could be quicken in non-seed there's nothing to be quickened they'll have a good feeling they have this but that but they can never come to birth never be born again they cannot come to real pentecost you see real pentecost began without an ending because it's life amen always was came to bur a time when pentecost i'm not talking about the denominational pentecostal shuck i'm talking about real pentecost real pentecost makes way for the holy ghost himself to come right into maturity to capping to positioning capping his positioning amen it caps off that birth word it's who you are you see where the bride's coming to right now that's why we're very close to a body change because she's knowing who she is care about the other they holler all you want about your little self-organization your self-denominations the reason you do that because you don't recognize the word living and an action in your day and if you don't recognize it there's something wrong maybe not born again because if you're born again the spirit of god in you would lead you into all truth hallelujah bring these things that i said to your remembrance correct you and you'll be quick to answer it spear the moment like brother george said just on sunday when it when it's this time you're hearing the word you hear what to do act on it right now how many of them missed it in the prayer line act on it raise your hand steady just stop for a few minutes you missed it how many have ever heard that sure all right so i'll stop there you say brother david how do i know how do i know how do i know that i was there see what he says okay i'll be closing here in just a short few minutes he says here paragraph 154 or 155 excuse me of the church age book if you are true seed well let's just back up here a minute page 154 what is i want to just solidify this there's no question in your mind what is the baptism of the holy ghost what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth and we just expressed how it would be born because that spirit comes to quicken that seed and it's a resurrection of christ in you amen that's the new birth all right he quickens it quickens the seed it's saying there to be quickened he planted it there before the world began he put it there but see we're too busy to go search for it oh i've got more to do i've got to kill some deer from my father leave me alone jacob i don't care about the birth right i've got too much to do than to sit down and fellowship with the lord and eat of the book and make sure i'm right you say yeah it hurt well it probably did but the nail needs to be clenched where are you standing are you born again well i hope i am that's not enough this new birth is not i hope i am and it's not because i believe the message i'm born again no that's not it either well i go to a message church that's not it either well i shout and i dance i had chills and i had this and i did that it's nothing you did or did not do it's a revelation in you it's truth presented it fills you it gives you life and you know it it's not because you i don't know what you'll do baptize baptize you may jump up and down you may cry you may weep you may go hallelujah you may scream top of your voice i don't know what you'll do it doesn't matter what you do that's not the question of the evidence of getting is it it changes you amen now where's your desire tonight you want that more than anything else you want that more than relationship you want that more than food you want that more than land and houses you want that more than money you want that more than popularity what is your desire tonight if you're longing for it there's a deep calling to that then there's the deep to respond god doesn't play around he's not speaking this message tonight just to play with you give you a message he's trying to get across to something here in his love all right now he said that's the new birth it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented heard the word and been baptized in water as an answer of good conscience towards god it comes in now there's people that can receive the baptism of the holy ghost prior to water baptism water does not save you water is just an outward conscious of the faith that you're expressing outwardly that i believe i died with him you're showing it in baptism and you rose with him that faith that i believe what he did for me and if there's a real repentance there's going to be a real birth amen all right so he says here be careful here he said it's not the person the country doesn't eternally from god it's the word or the seed that's what it is god sends his word to quicken that seed god sends his spirit baptism to quicken that seed it's the seed that god recognizes okay now if you are true seed you will hear that word if your true seed you will hear that word but when you hear in your he said no man is never the same when you hear the word of god you might hear in your ears the voice speaking but when you hear it in your heart the voice speaking see then you're hearing you do not see with your eye you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something and say i just don't see it you mean you don't understand it you do not hear with your ears you hear with your heart amen many times your ears can hear the true voice of god and it falls off like water off of a duck's back but when you really hear you hear with your heart that's on the message the voice of god in these last days you hear with your heart so what's your heart saying where's your heart where's your heart what's the affection of your heart you know the scripture on that amen set your affection on what things above not on things in the earth so if you'll hear that word if your true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive that word for your day and age how clear how clear the true evidence becomes see when the word is revealed to you now we've been constantly saying he said when jesus received the holy holy ghost positioned him as that son before them all and having been filled thus the same pattern holds at pentecost and ever after he went and demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of god and from god for that day full revelation what's he telling you here the evidence that where you were to begin with how do i know this is how you know he said now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost or born again is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives you have an ear to hear god okay let's just see here 1 273. on page 273. i thought it wouldn't take much time tonight but let's be all these no i'm not going to complain about that god has his way he said he had a ministry talking about judas he had a minister granted unto him and he healed the sick he cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he said how can that be when only god can cast out a devil because the rain falls on the just and the unjust they bear what they are though a cocklebur will never be a wheat and the wheat can never be a cuckleber but they receive the same rain and live by that rain but they can't receive the word for their season because the water was sent for the wheat and the wheat would bring the word because they'll bring forth of their kind the water of the lord the word will bring forth of its kind and that's what we see happening around the message we're seeing the separation to truth the separation between truth and error amen all right no mistake about it if a person that is truly baptized with the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in that word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost judas failed multitudes will fail right there and when they fail to go out in that word the names are taken off of the book of life amen i said and got to that portion that i wanted to but anyway all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bypass things that are to be but i want to say this in that your life was pre-planned nothing happens to a christian without or happens by chance it's all ordained of god just chew on that a while a christian he's not denoting a christian is a loose term today but real christian means they're tabernacling deity that's a christian christ like and you can't be christ-like without god being in you amen you're gonna you're gonna live this kind of life you're gonna receive the word as he did you're gonna know who you are as he did amen all right so so being christ-like is to have deity living in you that's a christian why are you a christian i will i go to a certain church i go to i go to uh brother paul's church i go to grace tabernacle and doing some a christian that doesn't mean a thing that you're a christian christians will go to church but because you come to this church you can go to hell i'm not saying that loosely i'm saying that with every bit of sincerity i know that doesn't save you just because you can proclaim intellectually i'm a part of the message without the birth of the word in you without the revelation of jesus christ in you you're not going in a rapture you're being left here for the tribulation so it behooves us to be sure because i don't know if you'll make it out of this room i don't know if you'll get home tonight i don't even know if i will amen let's why not have a knowing instead of a hope so instead of imagining it so let's have a hope so i mean excuse me have a no-sew where's the complaining when you know that you had to be if you had if you're born of god you had to be in god before the foundation of the world you had to have the gene of god in you and when you and when that receives that what's it declaring to you well then the brother sister failures and all that you've overcome every bit of that god's not looking by the ways of the flesh no more he doesn't judge you by the ways of the flesh he sees what's in you the blood has has sanctified and then allowed him to come in and live his life in you let's go beyond sanctification we're actually we're sanctified every day by the word the blood cleanses us keeps us clean let's go beyond that and get to the point of contact brother sister filled with the holy ghost in this hour you become god's point of contact and contact salt has to have contact in order to heal in order to express life in order to in order to to um ex to give life a believer can do that that's not the word i want to use so but to believers they can impart life that's what i want to say you can impart life the prophet said what is the greater works of jesus christ to impart life he said a believer can impart life to a believer a real christian can impart life but he has to have the contact and you are god's point of contact because you're god's word expressed in this hour you are himself living and the great revelation of it is that it's in bright form he is that had to be expressed to fulfill i'll leave it right there but everything everything has been pre-planned you are all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god it's all pre-planned amen then your failures your mistakes your ups and downs your trials your temptations has all been pre-planned by god so what are you going to do when you go through it you're going to take god you're going to place god in front of you place god before you it's been planned he knew it would happen he was all he allowed it just to see what you're gonna do you're being expressed in a being see all right but everything i don't believe a person just happened to be here even your birth here was pre-planned what about your spiritual birth now listen to this and i'm closing right here i don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance and when you come to the world everything had to be for prepared for you and pre prepared rather for you i don't hardly understand that how we could think that a god that could prepare all these good things for us would not could he not could we not put trust in could we not put trust in him he created you you didn't have anything to do with coming into the earth at this time he brought you this earth he created the worlds by spoken word he brought you here look at what he's done look where you were cannot you trust him if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the eternal things amen hallelujah that's right how much more can we trust him all pre-planned the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved you were already approved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and conducting my sin by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he he in his wisdom allows to come to pass amen ruthie if you'd come let's just bow our heads a moment our heavenly father you said and that's the question to these people here gird up the loins of your mind i could have read in peter where you said gird up the loins of your mind for and hope to the end for the revelation the glory that shall be shown you at the revelation of jesus christ we're here lord we've arrived [Music] but you're asking us now where were you you've answered that for us father i pray be not one here that will not get that right with you i ask you with all my heart to reveal yourself to them open your word lord i pray and i know you will because i'm not judging who is and who isn't i know you will the only way we can judge the difference is by the fruit they're bearing because every seed will
