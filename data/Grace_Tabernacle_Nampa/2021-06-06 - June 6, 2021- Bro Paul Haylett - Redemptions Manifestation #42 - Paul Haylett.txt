evermore [Music] [Music] hallelujah aren't you glad that we can claim that this morning amen to know that our hope is not in economics of this world it's not in all of the things that the world would offer but it's in our lord jesus christ amen unshakeable the rock that can't be moved amen that we would be as trees planted by the river of living water amen not something that's going to pass away i just want to announce um well in advance here i have we haven't placed an exact time but july the 4th is a sunday and it would have been our normal communion time and instead of changing that erratically to a different week i just want to announce that we will be having communion here at the church at the tabernacle here at june the 3rd which is a saturday evening and so that way i just wanted to kind of make it nice as it were for those who wanted to maybe enjoy the fourth of july um as as the time if you're into fireworks or barbecuing or whatever and so that that that sunday afternoon which would be actually the fourth of july will be open so communion i wrote june 3rd down here it's july 3rd yes communion was a couple days ago no july the 3rd it'll probably be around we'll kind of sort this out but 5 6 o'clock on that saturday evening is it good to be in the house of the lord saying it's good to see each one of you amen you know for the yannick sister sharon did you get that honeymoon business all settled yes wonderful wonderful good to have that let's just go to our thought this evening or today i mean i'm not going to preach that long redemptions manifestation you know just stuff that just keeps speaking to me saints of of uh what was promised to us and it has to come to pass so we we are witnessing the very manifestation of redemption amen and and we're seeing it god's mercies god's grace uh we see that no man ever was saved because of his good deeds or uh kindness of his heart or those kind of things but we recognize and i'm taking this from a quote but we recognize it is god's tender mercy is the reason that we are saved today and and uh i just thank the lord so much because of his tender mercies and as it was here our brother isaac and his prayer as he's there how gracious our god is to us how many times in our life that he has come down and very present and uh we may be not even aware of that but uh god knowing who we are what we are and why he called us amen so i want to speak to you today on the opening of the door the closing of the door uh you see my brother and sister that no matter what position we take spiritually no matter what place we are in life there's an opening and a closing and so we'll see that uh hopefully i can lay that out to you clearly today let's just stand as we go into the word to the book of ephesians the first chapter and um very familiar scripture to us uh and i just pray lay a little foundation uh to realize once again just an encouragement right we have nothing new to offer but we have the word to be reminded of to stir up our pure minds and and uh you know it's there that regardless of what our situation is you know you can you know i i am a ferocious reader uh and sometimes that's probably a detriment because then you you read and read and read and read and read and sometimes you need to actually mow the lawn and take out the trash but um you know you look at this and we realize in the day that we're living in saints that that uh the doors that are being opened uh prophecy to be fulfilled right that door can't remain closed and the prophecy be fulfilled so so doors open in seasons uh and i don't mean to politicize this but i i just still struggle with the idea that the best that we as a nation could produce as a president is what we have now so you look at that and realize saints that within the world we live in uh and i mean right here in idaho we could take men that would be more qualified and do a better job but you see when the door of prophecy opens and certain things must come to pass do you realize it was not the citizens of the united states that put this man in the office of president it was almighty god and he's in that office to fulfill certain things and so we can we can talk about how terrible this is we can talk about this you realize you're just wasting your time when you get in these great political debates of what and why what we need to do is just focus that and say you know what my god's in control and if we this morning cannot say god is in control then we this morning should be very nervous you should start digging your bunker and filling it full of concrete and then inside that concrete shell you'll need guns and ammo and food and this and that but wait my god is in control hallelujah now it's hard sometimes i remember many years ago we were kind of shopping for a car and uh found this little car and and i was like i'm buying this and sister jerry just is like paul go home and pray about it i'm like honey this is such a good deal i'm buying it please go home and pray about it i bought the car the motor blew up about 30 days later and i was like go home and pray about it paul please paul please listen go home and pray about it and there's a whole saga that goes with this because we then had the motor rebuilt and it blew up again and at the end of the day you know god has a way you say this is horrible brother paul i i wasted so much money on this car saints and i look back on it and all god was doing paul i'm going to send you to college university however you want to term it and you're going to take a class on praying about things before you buy them i had to pay the tuition huh amen i had to pay the tuition but god's still in control you know i say this jokingly no one get upset maybe the preacher had said a hundred times before you do these things go home and pray about it but hey who listens to the preacher [Music] so how many of you have paid tuition yeah yeah ephesians the first chapter 10th verse then in the dispensation of the fullness of times that means the complete not in the beginning and the end the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things hmm imagine that worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise thank you brother isaac for what god laid on your heart there to give him glory give him praise give him honor today we don't want the rocks crying out saints we don't want all of nature to have to cry out to worship him that's our job that's what we were called for don't leave that for someone else so well i don't want to call attention to myself well i we're not about ourself if we're giving praise to him it's about him amen that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now if the lord will be gracious to me we'll tie that in here in just a few minutes which is the earnest of our inheritance now i was just studying and i just read a quote that put it in this context in the presence of almighty god the glorious things he has done for us and this is just the down payment this is just the foretaste you know many years ago saints i was foolish i hurt myself and i had surgery and my knee was always hurting and then the lord as i've testified here in this church the lord healed my knee then i was trying to act like a young person and we were playing volleyball at the park out there along the orchard and there's a little plastic box there and um you know i i tried to chase down the ball and i tripped and fell down and drove my knee on that plastic box and then my knee started hurting again and uh you know you're just like okay okay and then you stomp and you say but just a second my healing is already purchased i don't have to go back for another anointing of healing i have to lay hold of the healing that's already given me and then god goes on the scene once again and delivers from the pain and the agony of it you see my brother and sister it's not about what he's done it's about what you're going to do with what he's done there's where it comes down which is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory heavenly father we ask you lord this morning just to come and speak to our hearts and lord you know our prayers and father our desire to you lord and to your people just ask you father come and move in our midst and father lay the foundation there'll be some here today lord that are in the midst of a trial uh lord there'll be some that have just come out of a trial there'll be some that will be just going into a trial so lord you're always on time and you're always present in the stages of our lives and we ask you this morning to come and speak to our lives father let us not look at father something that that is about the past or that is about the future but let us look at every bit of your word father as applicable to us today father we thank you for this and ask in your precious name amen you may be seated saints so as we are looking here i chose this title i actually kind of struggled i have to admit to title it uh but if we will by god's grace come along and see that for every door that is opened there is a season that it is open and then a season will come that it will close and for every door that is closed in your life at this time will be closed for a season but will be opened and so we want to be cognizant of the seasons what is going on in our life now i'm going to take a little left-hand turn here so i hope you follow me for just a moment as we've been reading this scripture here it is so real to us my brother and sister or at least i should say i trust that it's so real to you that you are identified here in ephesians 1. this is not about someone else this is about god coming down and in the end time gathering together in all things in christ and and it's here my brother and sister we can look at what's in the heavens we can look at what's in earth and we can look at what is in him and we are in him and so we have received this inheritance uh and it is my brother and sister a very precious thing now sometimes there is little fusses and fights about what this is that and what's that but uh brother branham and there's many quotes so i don't think any of us here today will be contesting that but brother branham says the bible is our absolute he didn't put it off as some other thing as some other idea or some doctrine or denomination or some counsel and he said the bibles are absolute so we certainly want to come and sometimes people can take people's words just had someone the other day come to me and say now i thought you said this and this and i said yes i did say that and that but you missed this over here which quantified all of it so words sometimes can be taken and put around but we have the word of god and you know we're looking at this scripture as i said in ephesians 1 and we see this beautiful story of of the word coming and how it is uh given that we have an inheritance now my brother and sister you won you had to be named in the will and there had to be something to give to you for there to be an inheritance and we were named in the will before the foundation of the world when he wrote our name in the lamb's book of life and said these are all that are going to inherit my character my nature and my life and so we're named in the will and so there has to be something to give and you know people want to contest over some things and they might say well you know we don't believe the seventh seal is opened we we don't see that but my bible says that it is and we would see all of the things that come and i liked how brother david had put that and said you know he did not see the seventh seal as being a doctrine it is a biblical foundation not doctrine my brother and sister to be interpreted but it is the word of god and so we'll see how's this the seventh seal is what if we go and break it down in simplicity and uh my dear wife kind of put it the other day she said you know i thank the lord for certain things that happened because it caused us to go and dig into something we knew we believed but why and what was the foundation and so you look at that and realize the seventh seal is the plan of redemption now my brother and sister if god has opened up the word to bring redemption he's not going to shut the word to the believer concerning redemption so it was as it is for the world today there is a season right uh that god gives uh to mankind to receive him a time i will hit a scripture here in just a little bit to kind of lay that in in a foundation but we'll see my brother and sister if we're not careful we can look around us and what we start to do is we start to focus on the evil and we start to focus on what seems to be the most obvious and you look at this and realize that that things must come to pass in such a fashion that the word of god would be fulfilled and so you know we look out here and we can say my and i look on on the computer uh you know at the news sometimes i try i've tried to i kind of go in cycles and i try to listen uh just to kind of see what's going on i try not to really get into the depths of it but the statistically speaking uh violence in our largest cities in america is skyrocketing we have had these events that have taken place uh seemingly out of nowhere and let's forget about race my brother and sister you and i are sons and daughters of god it didn't divide us by our skin color or what continent we come from we are simply born of him and we'll return back to him amen so the idea that the race is something that even christians a little article this well even christians have to deal with race and racial tension i was like nope they're not listening to the word of god because if they are listening to the word they don't see a different color they see their brother they see their sister in christ amen and so it's there the scripture says that we give no preference to man and if we give no preference then we give no difference now you have to kind of look that up maybe to see what it is because you see if we're not careful we tend to favor that don't we that's how they invented the best friend they had favor over this person and this person i'm not saying you do away with the best friend but you see we have to be careful because sometimes what we think is best friend is not really best for us imagine that you got to be about 60 years old to figure that one out but we look around us and what seems to be the most obvious is that the world is very wicked and very violent everywhere we look wickedness has pervaded everywhere we look violence has pervaded now look we'll go right here into genesis 6 11 and see now my brother and sister please don't i'm not speaking down so don't misunderstand me but just see if you can make a comparison to the day that we live in and that is here it is the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence now this was spoken in 2021 well it's relevant for our day amen and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt now i don't know how much you pay attention to the news but all you have to do is look in the news they're charging this ex-government official with this and this one's with this and this one's with that and this one over here laundered hundreds of millions out of his government and he hid it amongst his friends and and this one no my brother and sister it's corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah oh okay this gets us back in timeline we're talking to noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth now my brother and sister if we could change that and put it at the end of the book of revelation it would fit perfectly for this day but it has because it says as it was in the days of right it's also taken my brother and sister and applied directly out of this time that the earth was corrupt it was filled with all of this and violence and all of that and it come and god pronounced a judgment on it god said you know what i'm going to destroy this and people look at that and say well we we don't know a lot of people don't even the people who claim to be christians aren't sure that the anteluvian destruction actually took place and and you know if there's an ark we should have our hands on it and if there's this and if there's that my brother and sister that's fine we don't have to believe it but don't call yourself christian if you don't believe your bible amen if you don't believe your bible call yourself anything but christian no i'm not promoting you call yourself something else but you see christians believe the bible now we're going to step right here real quick and we look now oh i know what the problem is i didn't write this one down i realized i didn't write this down so luke 17 25 and 26 and then jumping to verse 28 but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation so there's going to take place there must become a rejecting you realize amongst college students in america today the number is escalating quickly of those who don't even believe there is a god and if there is a god he's not concerned with them it's not a number the number has been creeping up for years but now the number is escalating a wholesale rejection of jesus christ and look at this my brother and sister we've got some college students here some that have been to college finish college going to college we live in a world where families teach families church and serving god is optional a college education is mandatory and they start promoting that as early as the seventh and eighth grade in school you must go to college imagine america as it were that by sixth or seventh or eighth grade the teachers were standing there saying you need to find a church you need to find a group of people that you can gather together with have confidence in worship together what a different world we'd have but you see we reject god and embrace knowledge and their knowledge is destroying them because it doesn't knowledge does not produce character no matter how you look at this and where you go and am i against college no just young people please have the holy ghost when you go because they're just uh they're just a wicked place that has professor after professor that are now boldly the number is also increasing of the amount of professors in the united states that are boldly proclaiming their beliefs and it is typically anti-christian so they uh can boldly declare that i'm an atheist and i teach from that platform and no one cares but yet there's a small university back east where a professor one day and no doubt a time of um inspiration uh stood up and on the subject and said i'm a christian and i will teach this from that platform he was no longer a professor there at the end of that week because you see it was unacceptable for them to receive a man who would teach it from a biblical platform but it's also acceptable or it is acceptable to teach it from a atheistic but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation as it was in the days of noah so shall also in the days of the son of man jumping in verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it now you know that scripture and it goes on you see so we're laying a platform once again my brother and sister for genesis 6 the very judgment right is it not jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so if he rejected them for their corrupt and violent ways they're perverse in ways then he must reject it again but you see we could focus on that and we could preach service after service all we'd have to do is watch fox news or or any of the other online type things and and you would always have a sermon about what was going wrong in the world but you realize saints this isn't about what's going wrong in this world it's about what's going right in this world right now you realize that god has always dwelt with a despised few that's scripture he has never been in the majority he's always been in the minority he's always been as it were to put it in terms the underdog it has always been that there is just no way people will serve god in this day take your fox book or martyrs and you read that and you will find my brother and sister that the spirit of the dark ages especially amongst the wealthy was simply go along to get along but my brother and sister the bride of jesus christ their pocketbook never determined their spiritual position to be richer or poor right the marriage vows to be richer or poorer sons and daughters of god also take that vow to the lord jesus christ lord if you prosper me i'll serve you lord if i'm in poverty i will serve you it is not relevant to what the pocketbook or the investment account declares and so many people get caught up in that spirit to judge things as i would be by those things my brother and sister that's not what it's about it doesn't matter if there's eight or eight hundred or eight thousand if the holy ghost is moving in our midst then it's good and it doesn't matter if it's eight or eight hundred or eight thousand if god is absent we are god we have ichabod written over our door and so god has never viewed it in that realm of numbers amen but he's always viewed it in the quality of those people and so as we look at an ever increasing i bring this out to you this morning to let you just catch a glimpse that we are headed back to the very things that brought about judgment in the beginning has come and it is right here we're not hiding it's not our head in the sand we recognize in the world today we are moving back into that same atmosphere and the same spirit that brought it then is here now and so it must manifest the very same thing and as you look at that we want to be aware we want to not live in fear we don't want to put our plans on hold i'm not going to do nothing because the lord's coming that's not right either that will taint your thinking that will taint the way you approach life if you try to hunker down and just hide out till the lord comes that's not living life my brother and sister and god has told us through the scripture that he's all about life amen but i want to focus on you my brother and sister i want to focus on the purchased amen as we go back to our original scripture until the redemption of the purchase possession now look i want you to understand as we look in this scripture you realize my brother and sister that the purchase has already taken place we are now just simply looking at the redemption of that the actual physical claiming so the purchase the transaction all of that has taken place we look and we see how it was there in the scripture that enoch takes a rapture takes a body change disappears i can see it now through the neighborhood gossip chain it appears enoch's left his wife and children it appears enoch abandoned his church and has not spoken to a single friend since their last prayer meeting i always knew there was something wrong with enoch but what's the word say enoch pleased god and was not hallelujah if we could just be a church full of enochs that we wouldn't worry about pleasing this person and pleasing that person and pleasing this person and we would all not just singular at one or two but all put our priority on i want to please god and if i please god i know that my life would be pleasing to my wife and my children i know that my life as a pastor would be pleasing to the church if i'm pleasing god and if each one of us was to take that position i i'll i'm going to be pleasing to god i know i'll be pleasing to my husband as a wife i'll be pleasing as a mother and children saying i know if i please god that i will be pleasing to my parents and i it's just it's just an ever uh growing ever-encompassing thing and it all starts with the idea or the premise of pleasing god and the action that it would take my brother and sister and you know what the scripture tells us that there is nothing that's too hard for the lord so if we've got the holy ghost there's nothing you will face in this life that will be too hard for you amen you don't come and say i just can't do that brother paul i can't make that sacrifice i don't think i can i don't think i've got it within me to do that get down get serious before god put your heart on the altar let god pick your heart up and cleanse it for you and put it back and it will be there full of strength and courage oh my brother and sister that you'll be able because simply the word does not lie and there is nothing too hard for the lord amen hallelujah so we're talking about some people that the word says have been purchased amen and these are a people that right here in this age that we live in this time that we live in are finding favor we're not going to speak in a future tense we're speaking right now in very present tense are finding favor with almighty god amen god hears their prayers god answers their prayers and that's not even proof my brother and sister because i know i've seen the documentation of people that prayed for things they were not necessarily spiritual things they were actually probably closer to carnal things and they prayed for things they prayed for a good car they prayed for a good house they prayed for a good job and they say well that's kind of the evidence god's hearing my prayer but my brother and sister what a real son or daughter of god desires is more of christ amen that's what ought to be at the top of our list of our prayers lord i want more like you i want you father if i don't have anything of this life right here i have to have you and if god blesses you with a good house good car good job whatever so be it but my brother and sister put that relationship with jesus christ at the top of your prayer list hallelujah but there's a people oh isn't somebody happy this morning there's a people on the earth today finding favor with god amen we're not sitting here as a bunch of people down in the mud of the trenches just go ho ho being a christian boo who is so hard i don't know if i want to do it the world's having so much fun the world is going to hell in the handbasket yeah hallelujah so what do we want to focus on my brother and sister will preach to the borderline believer but you realize the borderline believer in their present state right remember i preached room for growth here recently so we're not speaking in permanent tense but we are speaking in present tense the borderline believer is this too hard paul okay it's not definitely not the borderline believer in his present tense is sold out to laodicea he's more worried about his personal pleasure his personal comfort his personal you can name it that's what he's worried about more worried about what is going to affect me i want life as good as possible i want to be popular you know popularity didn't work so well i don't want to go down that anvil avenue imagine dad i don't want to stay here on the farm i don't want to stay here dad i don't want to be expected to go to church i don't want to be expected to have to pray and so dad can you just divvy up what would be mine and just give it to me so i could do with mine as i desire do you realize how deep of a holy ghost-filled story that really is he received that check now we're going to adjust that for inflation he got his 1.2 million dollars from his daddy he went down to the city and he was wildly popular he had more friends than he ever thought he would have until the one morning he wakes up hungry and the only thing offered to him is the husks that have been dumped to the pigs where's his friends now where's his popularity now i don't remember who the man was that we could find the quotation if we do this just come to me spontaneously here but a man was quoted many years ago making a statement if you have one true friend in your life count yourself blessed oh what a friend we have in jesus oh hallelujah right my brother and sister you'll find though you'll see i don't remember where you'll find it but you'll talk about you know brother i'm talking about life story and how they were looked down on they were scoffed and mocked and whatever degraded and yet as he's there he he he looks out and he's lonely as a young man doesn't have a friend and then he says and here i am and by god's grace all that's changed in my life all that's happened and i come here and now i have to go hide from my friends imagine so we got a correlation that you've got friends out here in the world as long as you've got money and yet here in the body of believers the family of god you'll have so many people that care and love for you that if you oh you know what the word of god is not so fulfilling do you know that some of you are looking at me like [Music] this is very suspicious very suspicious our pastor just said the word of god is not self-fulfilling the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of god god didn't say i'll go find the kingdom for you and bring it back to you you got a seeker you got to have something in your heart the scripture says also repent another action that must be taken place god didn't just say i know they really would repent if i ask them to but i'll just say i'm just going to act like they did that's a problem we have in church sometimes we act like everyone has just got everything just right everything is good come on saints you got sin in your life you need to repent amen you want closer to god seek it you see the word of god is not self-fulfilling god wrote his word put it down in the bible for you and i to be able to take those promises apply them to our life hallelujah you know one time i bought this container of wax and i set it on the hood of my pickup and i left it there overnight and i got out in the morning and that lazy old wax had never applied itself but it promised it would save the paint on my pickup and make my pickup shine and make all the bugs this wash right off it promised that come on hallelujah now tonight put this on your nightstand and tomorrow morning you'll wake up just like you went to bed but you take this and start applying pardon the expression let's start applying right start putting on the whole armor of god and all of a sudden the word of god starts coming to pass starts fulfilling itself right in our lives right before us right in our families and and then it's a miraculous thing my brother and sister but it's not self-fulfilling it's not going to just you go to bed a sinner and wake up a saint it doesn't work that way you've got to come we're not believing in works gospel but you've got to apply the word of god to you hallelujah amen you see the borderline sold out to laodicea but there is a sold out people my brother and sister they're sold out to jesus christ hallelujah they've come to a place that they have taken and they believed the word and they said you know what of this whole world take this whole world but give me jesus amen because they're taking an action amen now we are here as i said uh take heed acts 20 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves to over the flock over which the holy ghost hath made you overseers see he's talking to the preachers right here he's talking to preachers the holy ghost made you overseers we're talking about real preachers dedicated to the church of god to the body of christ amen the overseers to feed the church of god in that interesting it says to feed them not fleece them it says feed them not boss them around feed them not extort them feed them not control them oh praise god there's still some real preachers on the earth all they care about is seeing some happy sheep some saints of god that are feeding on the word of god but look at this my brother and sister this last line right here is what really i focus to which he hath purchased it don't belong to the preacher it don't belong to the church it belongs to jesus christ he's the one that purchased them hallelujah with his own blood so there there we have this foundational laid out so we look my brother and sister and realize we've already been purchased amen now it's time to show what the lord jesus christ bought what did he buy did he buy a church full of lukewarm people he did not did he buy a church full of unbelievers only long enough for them to be revealed as real believers hallelujah you see he didn't buy a church he bought a people amen so it's there what is it now all we can do my brother and sister if we sit here today and say you know what yeah i've been purchased can can we say that let me let me back up here i'm getting ahead of myself a little bit can we say i've been purchased by his own blood amen so if he has already purchased you and i if he has already uh laid this claim out before us then you know what that means it means you are sold out it means you're not for sale again just had some guy calling you know it's the thing that's the rage now you know they just call your house at dinner time uh you own this will you sell it to us and i i at first would be just like don't bug me is there a for sale sign and i'm i'm like what are you thinking paul yes sir it's for sale oh well mr haylett we would really like to buy that from you i said yes the first 7.4 million can have it i said don't even bother doing the math you're not willing to pay the price i mean i would sell them a farm if they gave me a hundred and fifty thousand dollars an acre for it i mean wow but you see my brother and sister when you've been purchased you're no longer for sale hallelujah you see or jesus christ is not a real estate broker he doesn't pick you up here and offer you somewhere else for slightly more he's kind of i don't know how do i word this i hope you don't mind that i feel a little light-hearted this morning but he's just one of those people that just oh i know what some of you call it he's a hoarder he has collected of such a body of believers and he's not letting go of a single one oh it doesn't get your heart excited amen i mean wouldn't that just just break your heart to get up one morning and realize that god had put a for sale sign on you no no see now's the season as i already said to show what he bought we are here my brother and sister purchased of his own precious blood and i so love him for purchasing me i so love him for giving his own blood for me that i'm gonna show the world the value of the blood that was given for me hallelujah it is also if you would call it now i'm a person and i know it's a figure of speech but don't misunderstand me i'm a person that believes in having pride because if we don't have a measure of pride we become slobs so god didn't want you to be prideless he didn't want you to just be debased to the point that you don't care if you brush your teeth comb your hair or wear clean clothes no sir this bride of jesus christ has recognized the value of the blood of jesus christ and when she recognized that value she said i'm going to live up to what he paid for me i'm going to live up to the value he placed on me he said i'm a son he said i'm a daughter he said i'm a jewel he said i am a treasure oh hallelujah and i'm going to live up to his expectation oh praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah now look my brother and sister not everyone thinks that they have sold out not everyone some think they can come now pardon my words but some think they can come to church and make love to jesus christ and go right out here and make love to the devil no problem god help us we're not placing much value on the blood and i'll tell you what you go into the parable and you can see right there my brother and sister that when it come time amen to pay a price the near kinsman redeemer you know the one the word says was closer than jesus christ this is why we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and he said i'm not laying down my life it might mar my inheritance you know why one thing lucifer didn't have was a revelation of eternal life he was excuse me he was there going if i lay my life down will i be able to raise it up i'm not marrying my inheritance for them so what i'll do instead instead of paying the price for them boaz what'd he do it was a custom of the day took his shoe off put it right there and it become the token of the evidence that everything he had research a little bit if you have time if you don't take the time just trust me it's right there in the scripture took the shoe off and when he placed that shoe he was promising everything he had to back up this vow this promise isn't that amazing hallelujah you know i've spoke to the church here about about that time or two trying to make a point now look you can have a mortgage on your house and you sign that and times got tough i mean like really tough and it fell apart they just come and take your house from you but when you sign your name and your name is ensuring that no matter what and what you possess will fulfill this obligation they don't just come take your house they come and take your car you'll pick up this and that and that and that and that until they're satisfied my brother and sister the lord jesus christ said no my blood will be sufficient you notice he didn't have to offer any other price for our redemption but his blood his blood had such value he knew that when he gave his blood for you and i it would cover every sin every unbelief every factor of our life for now until we are redeemed and gone in a rapture he didn't have to say i'll give another and if i need more i'll come and give more if there's another i can do no my brother and sister he said i'll shake heavens and earth for my little bride i'll shake heavens and earth because i've already bought them they're mine and they are the purchased possession hallelujah oh i tell you what this ought to make us walk out of here today with our shoulders back saying thank you lord i'm worth more than i thought i was worth hallelujah now look i want you to understand this warfare it goes on right the devil he's always trying to make us look like we have no value make us feel oh feelings why did i bring up feelings why did i bring up feelings i told jerry this morning i feel so tired if i wasn't the pastor i would stay home and stream today feelings look what the devil's doing all the time he's trying to get you to feel like you're not worthy can you show me one place in the scripture that the redeemed are ever declared unworthy can you show me one place where the redeemed are ever declared unrighteous or unholy no my brother and sister the word shows us quite clearly that when he said you will be righteous because i am righteous you will be holy because i am holy you will be redeemed because i am the redeemer he didn't say how you feel about it but you see the devil's constantly trying to get the feelings in there get the feelings in there hallelujah amen shut off the transparency app paul you realize the one who bought judas is the same one who bought elvis thirty pieces of silver is all judas needed a fleet of cadillacs and a hundred million dollars is what it took to buy elvis boy inflation's a terrible thing but i want you to look at this judas's world of influence his sphere of influence was quite small and elvis with a gift the devil looked at the potential and said i'm willing to invest millions into this one because his life will impact millions is elvis's sin any greater than judas no sin is sin but look at this this ought to make somebody happy this morning the same one who bought purchased the 120 in the upper room is the same one who bought purchase the bride of this day hallelujah 120 became as it were millions my brother and sister in 120 in an upper room god said you know what i purchased them and they will have an impact on the whole world and i'm going to purchase a bride in the last day amen and she's going to impact a whole world and you know what he paid the exact same price for a hundred and twenty as he has paid for millions because the value of the blood of jesus christ was more than sufficient he said my grace is sufficient hallelujah hallelujah oh my i'll tell you i just i can't help it i get excited about this when i i feel like god didn't come and say you know paul haylett you being not so much i'm just going to give just a little bit for you and the apostle paul the other paul that i have in my life the apostle paul oh look at the impact he had i'm going to pay a greater price for him no my brother and sister his blood was sufficient and his blood is sufficient hallelujah we don't have to go look for another add-on we don't have to have penance we don't have to have some kind of servitude we don't have to have any other add-on to it the blood is sufficient oh hallelujah i think that ought to get somebody excited this morning god paid full price for me now there's a downside of that and the devil will remind you that yeah you had a lot of sin to pay for you had a lot of sin to pay for ah we ain't murdered nobody i won't send anybody to prison so i think the apostle paul had a greater debt i hope you didn't agree with me the lost is lost the redeemed is redeemed the blood is sufficient the price was paid willingly not grudgingly now look saints if you have a grudging christian spirit on you this morning i want you just to bow your head in your heart right here this morning and ask god to forgive you there should be nothing grudging in your life god called you you say but brother paul our life is difficult well that's right and my heart goes out to those people who done but my brother and sister some people's battle is in the flesh as in laboring and struggling to live some it's in the flesh being burnt up with the lust of the flesh and pride of life some people's greatest battle is right here in their mind and they struggle over and over on that same battle my brother and sister there's no one going to get out of here without battle scars no one's going to get out of here with a free pass go past 200 collect the reward my brother and sister every one of you will fight for everything that you want everything you desire as a son or daughter of god you're going to fight for it and that's why i say and once again go back to reiterate that the word of god is not self-fulfilling you will fight for every promise that you see and believe and confess in the word of god and you might as well get rid of that grudging christian spirit of woe unto me and stand up and say the blood of jesus christ has redeemed me and my life will become his life and his life will be my life and i will stand and show the world that serving jesus christ is worth it not that grudging woe unto me spirit that's the devil in disguise why because you'll have low expectation and low result and then you won't blame it on you i did all i could do that's right but you didn't do all he could do through you there's the difference you got to open up let go and let god are we doing all right hallelujah somebody stole the time already amen now look door open door closed now look at this here i hope are are you following me sometimes you know see we put we put thoughts that have been rattling around in our head and our heart and notes and whatever you know from from days and weeks and whatever and put them all together here and well in the early hours of the day or late hours of the night or whatever it all makes perfect sense to me but i don't know that it does to you now look then this person that was did not want now talk about the jubilee did not want to go free could had to be sealed now you're going to understand i hope by god's grace here why i'm talking about a door opener door closed did not want to go free could had to be sealed a beautiful type today of the sealing of god or the marking of the beast which has been so much disputed now let's just dispute that for a minute my brother and sister look in the world we got today you don't have to look very far out here in the world i'm going to call it social media even though i really don't do social media but you know bill gates is the antichrist barack obama was the antichrist and george bush was the antichrist and this person's the antichrist and this is the antichrist you know why they're doing that because they're standing like way too far from the dartboard and they're going there's got to be antichrist oh my neighbor come on they don't have a clue it's the reason you understand what they're doing the old phrase they're fishing in the dark and you can catch something fishing in the dark if you bait the hook but they're not even beating the hook so they don't have a clue the world today all over go on youtube go all over the social media go all over the internet and look at what the antichrist what the answer here is what what does the bible say it's not too hard it's on seven hills trace its roots right back to the dragon it's not too hard but you see if your eyes can't see and your ears can't hear and you cannot understand it's hid from them it should be really obvious my brother and sister you've been blessed of god to see so look at this this much disputed the people have you ever noticed let me throw this in have you ever noticed the people they hate or the antichrist and the people they like always have the holy ghost human nature but i tell you what it is if you're for the word believe the word confess the word live the word or you dispute the word push away from the word imagine what it was now faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god and when we hear that we are free and refuse to act upon our freedom hmm did you hear yeah i heard it's jubilee season i know but i'm comfortable i've been a deacon in our church for 20 years i have a good job and i've got retirement i've got a house and i just wanted to stay like it is i'm comfortable here do you go there or not paul another day excuse me i'm just holding a conversation with myself and when we hear that we are free and refuse to act upon our freedom then we will be sealed to my opinion to be sealed away from god is to receive the mark of the beast for to hear is to receive and when we hear that we are free then we can accept it and be free and when the hearer heard the jubilee sound and if he didn't want to be free come on saints there ought to be something rejoicing in your heart that god put down in you the desire i will be free hallelujah i will break away from those things those chains they've been cut i am free oh hallelujah and when we hear that we are free then we can accept it and be free do you realize it's all up to you the word of god's not gonna come down here and it's not gonna force you to live in a liberty in jesus christ he's not gonna force you to leave the spirits that have bound you and left you unhappy he's not going to force that off of you you've got to stop and say it's the year of jubilee i've heard the word and the word said i am free and he who is free is free indeed i'm free i'm free of bitterness i'm fear of remorse i'm fear of condem free of condemnation i'm just free from this because i've heard the voice declared in my day i am free but you'll see people they'll hold on to spirits they'll hold on to attitudes they'll hold on to views that they have and all my brother and sister and they wonder and get more bitter and get more angry and get more whatever because they see a people moving forward into liberty and they're over here standing at the post at the temple saying i don't know how they can do that where's their security where is their where's their concern where's their what are they doing what are they doing how can you be happy in the world we live in today how can you be happy in these fiery trials how can you be happy because i heard didn't you hear didn't you hear the voice i'm free i'm no longer bound by sin by chain and by attitudes and spirit i'm no longer bound by church tradition i've been set free oh hallelujah the word said i'm free and i believe the word over anyone hallelujah now when they hear heard the jubilee sound and if it didn't want to be free then he had to be sealed as it is today that when men and women hear this marvelous gospel the lord jesus christ and of the baptism of the holy ghost you're a place where you have to make a choice now see this seems so subtle or i mean seems so open but it's very subtle because my brother and sister people will confess that they're saved by the gospel of jesus christ they'll confess that they have the holy ghost but i'm also a fighter pilot and a billionaire just ask me i'll tell you sounds absurd doesn't it i hope you catch the point just because they say doesn't mean they are right you know they come up with that term many years ago rhino republicans in name only and they touted that it was like a slur ah you're a republican name only that means you're not a real republican and there's been quite a few years and i went probably a good decade before i ever heard somebody else repeat this but one day i was just there looking and i thought that's right there's chinos christians in name only and today that when men and women hear the marvelous gospel of the lord jesus christ know the baptism of the holy ghost you're a place where you have to make a choice you can never hear it and be the same if you accept it you receive christ if you refuse it you're sealed away from christ and it makes a difference of your attitude towards a hearing of the word my are we all right okay i just need just a few short more minutes here and i was speaking this morning in a wonderful place here in the city at tabernacle i was speaking on this very subject that god wants his church to be free many things has happened during these 50 years many people you see that next word many people believers has been caught and taken captive by the world so these were people my brother and sister they said right in the house of god they heard the preaching of the word they said amen to the word of god they live that but the enemy come in broke down the gate crept in i just say this for just a minor emphasis if you're in bed at night and you hear crashing of wood and breaking of glass now i know i'm a true blue born in idaho which means to prove your real true loyalty to the character and nature of idahoans i have guns stuffed everywhere and that that's kind of what proves your dedication okay somebody's got a sense of humor you hear glass breaking you hear wood crunching you're probably not going to say i think it's the cat but you know that's not the way the devil works you've never seen the devil once come and take a big battering ram and knock down the front door what the devil does is he drops a flyer in your mailbox and then the devil somehow gets the preset on your radio to a different station and you realize that's the same song i listened to when i was 16. oh such lovely memories and then pretty soon you start acting like you're 16 and dressing like you're 16 and listening to the music of 16 and the attitude of 16. and then people go i just don't know what happened over the years i just i just realized now that being a christian is not all i was taught it was no especially when the devil's doing the teaching when the devil's the tutor my brother and sister christianity is never gonna be what you thought you were taught and you can see this now you say brother paul you sound a little harsh or a little critical no but i'm telling you i've seen this over and over again of people i personally know and watch the transition and i have spoken words to them and i have begged them and i've tried to encourage them and i've tried to bring them back to a place open your eyes and see what you're doing and they start reliving their life in a different world my brother and sister and all of a sudden well i think we're all going to heaven it's just a matter of where you'll be in heaven okay i want to be up in the cascades of heaven not in the bronx of heaven many people believers has been caught and taken captive by the world many people denomination barriers sometimes separated fellowship and draw barriers i was singing here not long ago someone asked me brother branham what church do you belong to i said there's really only one church the church means the call now hallelujah i belong to church hallelujah i'm called out ah thank you lord hallelujah now as we look at this my brother and sister see what's happened right here we'll look as we go back and i won't go back in the quote but we'll look at this my brother and sister what's happening a door opens we're invited to step through it but when that door of the holy spirit then closes it seals you in and there are people my brother and sister people say well they have the holy ghost and they backslid and don't serve god now they had an anointing on this old guy right here because we see clearly in the word of god when the holy ghost comes and seals you it seals you to the day of your redemption you can see the devil right out there and i don't know if you know how to pick a lock i used to kind of experimented that stuff and but you know i realized i had no business doing that because why would i be doing that but you know you can take a small thin spring wire and a flat thin piece of metal that's flexible and you take and slide the metal flat one in there it goes at a slight taper and you keep working it until you push the pins up and then you use the spring wire to hold that pin up while you move on to the next pin and press it up i know you all want to know how to do this but did you know they make locks that can't be picked and god put one of them on the door of your heart god didn't put some cheap little five dollar walmart kmart whatever kind of lock on the door of your heart god put a lock on the door of your heart and i can see the devil out there morning noon and night and he's holding that thing and he's sliding that wire and pushing that thing and sliding it and he's spending hours doing that and he hears them then the holy ghost which is the guard dog of our life comes out of the backyard and the devil's like oh my goodness they're praying again i gotta get out of here i can't deal with this atmosphere they start to pray and i tell you what it just it's hard on me it's hard on me i just can't do it and they flee but you know what he'll be back the next night or the next week once again knelt down at your door trying to pick it but god has put an impeccable lock called the holy ghost in your life oh hallelujah aren't you glad god's got a lock that can't be picked and he seals you to the day of your redemption and i'll tell you what my brother and sister it makes my heart break but i see people that that the devil's picking the lock to my door i'll just make it easy for him hi no my brother and sister no believer no real believer is going to do that they're going to be there it's like look the devil's knocking on the door of my family knocking on the door of my life on the door of this lord come quickly come on the scene lord hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my you see hearing and receiving the door is then closed and you're sealed in hearing and rejecting the door is then closed and you're sealed out the door is opening and the door is closing it happens in every individual's life there is none all this only for these it's only for those no i'm sorry the door opens and the door closes it all depends on which side of the door you want to be in do you realize in the old days you know right after the jews started coming back you know right uh and uh actually before world war ii really got started right the british controlled palestine and and jews were starting to come back that anointing was starting to work starting to move they were starting to come back to their land and and uh you know they did all they could do to keep these people out they didn't want they didn't want them there they didn't want them there and and you know what what happened is is that people were so desirous were so anointed my brother and sister that they would do almost anything imaginable some chose the route of the del desert only to be caught up with a army patrol and and rounded up to be we're going to send you back and they just did everything they could do and some my brother and sister so desperate oh i hope you get this some become so desperate they prayed some marched through deserts some swam some did this some did that some tried to be smuggled in some and some prayed lovely stories of whole families in prayer lord you know we feel anointed to go back to the holy land to go back to our land to go back to our home oh god this is our horse desire and they come there and the british authorities are like okay why did you come here and the man's then anointed anointed telling the truth anointed he doesn't come to say i just want to return back to the holy land i want to come back to my land of my nation of my people the man comes and says i want to come here and start this certain kind of business a bakery and they're like we don't have enough bakeries come god opens a door god closes a door when god seals you and by the way that man's family is alive and well and prospered in israel all these years god opens the door the devil can't close it god closes the door the devil can't open it what we need is to go home and pray about it amen that's what our real need is pray about it lord if the door's supposed to be open you will open it if the door is supposed to be closed lord you will close it but also be cognizant saints the word shows us very clearly god opens the door for a season and there'll come a day prophet of god says the very seat that is the mercy seat is becoming the judgment seat and we'll be preaching on that here in just a little bit i want to go into that series after we just wrap a couple more things here but i want you to understand the prophet of god also gives a very clear picture that in the heart of the true believer god is always on the mercy seat don't be afraid oh god's turning into a judge he's turned into a judge what are we going to do well get inside that door get filled with the holy ghost let him put his lock on the door and then he'll always be on the mercy seat for you hallelujah amen i'm just going to cut off the last of my thought here i think i've made it as best as i will sister emmy if you would come but this is so good we'll catch it again another sunday amen now i try to be very careful about what i listen to for music can you all say the same okay i hope so because the prophet of god said that music has a direct entrance right but these were parts of a song i think a pentecostal lady sing the song i thought it i thought it was just nice to think about these words holiness has a name and it's jesus victory has a name and it's jesus healing has a name and it's jesus redemption has a name and it's jesus the word has a name and it's jesus hallelujah i wish more of the world had a revelation of john 1 you know that just helped a lot of people out help a lot of people have them you know i don't know that this is the right number i had it scribbled on a piece of paper and it just struck me this song the blood will never lose its power i have 563 i don't know if that's actually what it is or not amen i know at one time we changed books or something like that and brother jason converted this to a book had much much more songs in it and so it changed the numbers or whatever there we are hallelujah let's just stand and sing a song or two before we go this morning i pray my brother and sister as the door of the word has been opened to you and i step through it receive it act upon it declare it hallelujah then let that door of the holy spirit close behind you oh my brother and sister [Music] i don't want to overemphasize this but if you're shopping for a convenient inexpensive spirit to seal you you will find one but if you're willing to go to the real locksmith the one that opens hearts changes lives if you're willing to do that he will seal you with a lock on the door of your life that the devil no matter how hard he tries can't pick it oh doesn't the word give you joy when you read that that you're sealed into the day of your redemption it just makes my heart just tingle to realize that god in his infinite grace and mercy could put a paddle lock called the holy ghost on our life and lock it up so tight that the devil can go around and around in the year after the year after the year after the year and not make one bitter progress of getting in and changing you thank you lord oh hallelujah you know part of the reason god did that just like they had you know like 12 layers of security at fort knox the reason god did this is because he knows the value of the blood and when the blood was deposited in you the word the life he said i'll lock it up tight nothing will corrupt we could go into so many scriptures about moth and corrupt and whatever that we touch but you see it can't get in there can't change it same holy ghost that god's given to you just as good tomorrow as it will be if the lord tarries and you're 99 years old it'll be just as good in that beautiful hallelujah hallelujah the blood that jesus [Music] [Music] it's [Music] [Music]
