[19:01] [Music]
[19:09] lord just laid the song on my heart
[19:10] earlier today um
[19:12] so kind of a last minute thing but
[19:16] the guy who wrote this song was
[19:19] down on his face praying for
[19:22] forgiveness for taking worship and
[19:25] turning it into a show
[19:27] basically and from that
[19:30] time he wrote this song and sometimes i
[19:33] need to i need a reminder that
[19:37] god doesn't want our lip service he
[19:39] wants worship from our hearts
[19:43] [Music]
[19:50] when the music fades
[19:54] and all is dripped away
[19:57] and i simply come
[20:00] [Music]
[20:04] longing just to bring
[20:08] something that's a worth
[20:11] that'll bless your heart
[20:13] [Music]
[20:17] i'll bring you more than a song
[20:21] for a song in itself is not what you
[20:26] have required

[21:35] well all i have is yours
[21:39] every single breath
[21:45] i'll bring you more than a song
[21:49] for a song in itself is not what you
[21:53] have required
[21:58] you search much deeper within
[22:03] through the way things appear you're
[22:06] looking

[23:52] [Music]
[23:58] pleasing let me be pleasing to you
[24:06] please
[24:10] let me be pleasing to you
[24:17] and everything that i
[24:21] do be pleasing to you
[24:30] praise
[24:35] let everything
[24:38] i pursue
[24:40] [Music]
[24:42] be pleasing
[24:46] [Music]
[24:53] oh yes please
[24:59] let me be pleasing
[25:03] to you and everything
[25:08] that i do
[25:11] be pleased
[25:14] [Music]
[25:22] let everything i personally
[25:31] [Music]
[25:39] hallelujah is that our hearts desire
[25:41] today
[25:42] i believe that's the heart's desire of
[25:44] every christian
[25:46] amen you know often times saints we use
[25:49] terminology like we say well every real
[25:52] christian
[25:54] but if you're a christian you're real
[25:58] there's no fake christian in reality
[26:02] right because to be a christian is to be
[26:04] christ-like so therefore you have to
[26:06] meet the guidelines or qualification
[26:08] to even be a christian so anyway
[26:11] i'm terrible with names and stuff
[26:13] brother peter
[26:15] yes god bless you brother good to see
[26:16] you here i don't know whether to
[26:18] acknowledge you as sister julia's
[26:20] brother
[26:21] or the kid's uncle but either way we're
[26:24] happy that you're here and god bless you
[26:26] amen so let's just um
[26:29] let's just uh you know remember
[26:33] everyone i was just thinking as i was in
[26:35] the back this evening
[26:37] often times we we get so caught up in
[26:40] what we're doing at the moment
[26:42] that we kind of forget about those that
[26:45] are not with us you know
[26:48] maybe i don't want to place my mama
[26:51] first out of any selfish thing but you
[26:53] know sometimes we forget you know
[26:55] uh like my mama over there brother bob
[26:57] sister joe ann
[26:59] uh brother prashaan sister concha you
[27:01] know
[27:02] uh and those in our midst that for
[27:04] whatever reason brother sergey out on
[27:05] the road don't know if
[27:07] he's coming or going north or south but
[27:09] you know just we know their
[27:11] hearts desire i know my brother vasily
[27:14] you know
[27:14] just as you travel the highways you just
[27:17] always
[27:18] uh always you know part of this body of
[27:20] believers
[27:21] and we don't want to be negligent to
[27:24] remind
[27:25] each one and to lift our prayers before
[27:28] the lord right because they come up
[27:30] before the throne of god as a sweet odor
[27:32] uh how many of you uh took the time to
[27:35] listen to the little testimony that
[27:37] brother
[27:37] vasily posted now my brother and sister
[27:41] when you look at that and i'd encourage
[27:43] each one that hasn't listened to that to
[27:45] listen to it
[27:46] because what you're seeing some people
[27:48] would say that is so
[27:50] improbable well i serve a god that does
[27:52] what the world thinks is improbable
[27:55] i serve a god that does the supernatural
[27:58] and to see in this little recording i
[27:59] don't want to give it away or dwell upon
[28:01] it
[28:02] but to see how that god would deal with
[28:04] a heart to do something
[28:06] oh god make us tinder and our hearing uh
[28:09] to be that when he speaks we don't brush
[28:12] it off as just
[28:12] thoughts or some circumstance but to
[28:15] literally say okay lord i
[28:17] i am a son of god and and that struck me
[28:20] very much brother vasily i appreciate
[28:22] you posting that because tonight
[28:24] a little bit of what we're going to hit
[28:26] on will
[28:27] have to do with hearing and uh you know
[28:30] we are
[28:31] truly blessed beyond measure for god to
[28:34] speak to us
[28:35] now it's one thing if i could put it in
[28:37] this context it's one thing
[28:38] that maybe god lays upon the heart of
[28:40] the minister and he preaches something
[28:43] and you hear him or you don't
[28:47] and it might be as it were the wise man
[28:50] the sage
[28:51] an older person with years of experience
[28:54] and says uh
[28:56] i would do this or i wouldn't do this
[28:58] and you listen
[28:59] or you don't but when god speaks
[29:04] and we don't we have a serious problem
[29:08] we want to be mindful of the things of
[29:12] god
[29:12] and to hear him speak to us listen
[29:15] i want to speak to you tonight once
[29:17] again drawing this thought out of
[29:19] uh proverbs uh and i just wonder if
[29:23] anybody uh
[29:24] can say amen to the title amen
[29:28] now i just i say that because look this
[29:31] book right here defines who we are
[29:34] and this is a book of prophecy and
[29:36] sometimes we read it and say well these
[29:38] things will be and it's here in the
[29:40] bible
[29:41] but my brother and sister don't forget
[29:43] that this word of god is prophecy to
[29:45] sons and daughters of god
[29:47] and it's also prophecy to those who
[29:50] never want to serve god
[29:52] it's all right here confined right
[29:54] within the words of god the path
[29:56] of all mankind and i am glad today that
[30:00] i can say i am
[30:01] when i was prophesied to be hallelujah
[30:04] let's just stand and turn in our bibles
[30:06] uh proverbs the 30th chapter and uh
[30:10] forgive me i i was going to uh i was
[30:13] going to look up these words so i could
[30:15] pronounce them correctly
[30:17] so i wouldn't look like i was some
[30:19] uneducated boy from idaho
[30:22] uh but you know my ipad just i don't
[30:24] know
[30:25] i don't want the devil to sit outside
[30:27] and cry because i'm blaming him for
[30:29] something he had nothing to do with but
[30:31] you know i was finishing up my thoughts
[30:33] and my ipad did this great big flicker
[30:36] and half of my notes disappeared poof
[30:41] and so i was like well what was fresh on
[30:43] my mind i kind of put in and
[30:46] maybe the rest was just gone because
[30:48] maybe we would have been
[30:49] burning the midnight hour because i was
[30:51] all excited about this but
[30:54] anyway um i didn't have time to look up
[30:57] these words so forgive me if you say man
[30:59] brother paul you don't have a clue how
[31:01] to pronounce them
[31:01] you are right amen proverbs the 30th
[31:05] chapter starting with the first verse
[31:07] the words of agur the son of jacob
[31:11] even the prophecy my so right here
[31:15] he is acknowledging this the man spake
[31:17] unto i feel
[31:19] and even into feeling you call surely i
[31:22] am more brutish
[31:23] this is quite a claim right surely i am
[31:26] more brutish
[31:28] if you take that word on out you can
[31:30] take it and of course it breaks it down
[31:31] and i don't know if that's just modern
[31:33] english or not but
[31:34] surely i am more rude or surely i'm more
[31:37] surely
[31:37] surely i am more uh abrupt surely i'm
[31:41] more brutish than any man
[31:43] and have not the understanding of a man
[31:46] i neither learned wisdom nor have the
[31:48] knowledge of the holy
[31:51] but you'll notice right here going into
[31:53] verse 4 there's a subtle shift taking
[31:55] place
[31:57] who hath ascended up into heaven
[32:00] or descended who hath
[32:03] gathered the wind in his fists
[32:08] who hath bound the waters in a garment
[32:13] hath established all the ends of the
[32:16] earth
[32:17] what is his name and what is his son's
[32:21] name
[32:22] if thou canst tell
[32:25] every word of god is pure he is a shield
[32:28] unto them that put their trust in him
[32:34] i down not unto his words lest he
[32:37] reprove thee
[32:38] and thou be found a liar
[32:42] you know this is actually my brother and
[32:43] sister right here
[32:46] a very kind expression because in the
[32:49] book of revelation it says you add a
[32:51] word or take a word away your name is
[32:53] taken out
[32:54] done away so right here is a very kind
[32:57] gentle reproof
[32:59] add nothing add thou not into his words
[33:02] lest he reprove thee and
[33:04] thou be found a liar two things have i
[33:06] required of thee
[33:08] deny me them not before i die
[33:12] remove far from me
[33:15] vanity and lies give me neither poverty
[33:18] nor riches
[33:19] feed me with food convenient for me
[33:24] lest i be full and deny thee and say who
[33:27] is the lord or lest i be poor and steal
[33:30] and take the name of my god in vain
[33:33] accuse not a servant unto his master
[33:36] lest he curse thee and thou be found
[33:38] guilty
[33:40] there is a generation that curseth their
[33:43] father and doth not bless
[33:44] their mother there is a generation
[33:48] that are pure in their own eyes yet is
[33:51] not washed
[33:52] from their filthiness there is a
[33:54] generation
[33:56] oh how lofty are their eyes and their
[33:58] eyelids are lifted up
[34:00] there is a generation whose teeth
[34:03] are as swords and their jaw teeth as
[34:06] knives to devour the poor from off the
[34:09] earth
[34:10] and the needy from among men heavenly
[34:13] father we just ask you lord to come
[34:14] tonight and
[34:15] be with each one father present tonight
[34:18] lord or
[34:19] home lord healthy or not feeling well
[34:22] out on the road wherever it might be
[34:24] father just ask you father lead us
[34:27] guide us speak to us lord we ask in the
[34:30] precious name
[34:31] of jesus christ amen you may be seated
[34:35] you know i look in this and and uh not
[34:38] to
[34:38] dwell on some of this for too long but
[34:41] as you look at this my brother and
[34:43] sister truly the book of proverbs
[34:45] lists these things that are that are
[34:48] what i would call
[34:49] of great knowledge of great value uh to
[34:52] just take the things uh
[34:54] uh to uh share with us
[34:57] uh in a simple uh term to bring us
[35:01] you know i really uh like verse 8
[35:05] remove far from me vanity and lies
[35:09] give me neither poverty nor riches now
[35:12] we look at that my brother and sister
[35:14] and i i'd say that that balance is there
[35:17] you know as you look
[35:18] how god would come and the scripture
[35:21] says that not many mighty men or rich
[35:23] men will make it so
[35:25] i i don't want to pray or ask you or
[35:28] press to become one of those that you
[35:30] know i hope you don't mind the way i
[35:32] word this tonight
[35:33] but i i don't want to choose a path that
[35:35] would reduce
[35:38] the odds of me making it now you say
[35:40] well brother paul we believe in
[35:41] predestination but i believe you
[35:43] understand what i'm saying why
[35:45] our heart is crying for that path that
[35:47] leads us right into righteousness
[35:50] we don't want to just figure out the the
[35:52] least that it would take to make it
[35:55] we don't want to figure out just how
[35:57] little we have to do or
[35:59] how low our life can be lived and still
[36:02] make it i don't believe that is the
[36:04] spirit of god i don't believe that is
[36:06] the nature of god
[36:07] god did not come our lord jesus christ
[36:09] did not come
[36:10] and say you know what i i'm gonna just
[36:13] do
[36:14] just enough to express this plan of
[36:17] redemption
[36:18] so they'll get it but i i don't want to
[36:20] have to do too much
[36:22] my brother and sister the struggle that
[36:24] took place in the garden
[36:25] he's there and it was a real struggle as
[36:28] the drops of blood come as though they
[36:31] were sweat and
[36:32] poured from him and he cried out
[36:35] ultimately expressed i believe what
[36:37] should be the heart's desire of each one
[36:39] of us and it's lord
[36:40] not my will be done because my will
[36:43] wants an easier way
[36:45] my will wants it to not cost so much my
[36:47] will wants it to be in such a fashion
[36:50] lord
[36:50] that it that it is not too tragic or too
[36:53] difficult
[36:54] but he says lord not my will
[36:57] but thy will be done you know we have a
[37:00] spirit that is upon the land today and
[37:02] and we'll find as it is that to to keep
[37:06] the churches full
[37:07] to keep the coffers full to keep a
[37:10] certain degree
[37:10] you might say of popularity in the
[37:13] church
[37:14] we're finding the spirit is a continual
[37:17] decline or compromise
[37:19] to make it more convenient for people to
[37:22] come to church and
[37:23] we have early church and we have late
[37:26] church and we have
[37:27] old-fashioned church and we have modern
[37:29] church and
[37:30] but what we have most of all if we're
[37:33] not careful is a compromised church
[37:35] and god didn't say you know what i want
[37:37] you to do is
[37:38] is just do your best in a compromised
[37:41] way i i don't want you to
[37:43] to have to give too much he actually
[37:46] told us
[37:48] you're going to have to sell out you're
[37:51] going to have to
[37:51] die to yourself you're going to have to
[37:54] give it
[37:55] all for me and it's interesting because
[38:00] it really comes down to and it's
[38:02] difficult for people to
[38:03] to take this but he basically gave it to
[38:06] us as you know what serving me is an
[38:09] all or none situation
[38:14] because anything short of all is
[38:16] insufficient and we
[38:18] think all is not really in the fashion
[38:21] my brother and sister that we would
[38:22] think because
[38:23] we might have money in the bank live in
[38:25] a nice house drive a nice car
[38:27] but we have to give all of our self
[38:32] there's where the real challenge comes
[38:34] we we have to
[38:35] die to ourself and you know as you look
[38:38] at this you realize that every word of
[38:40] god verse 5
[38:41] every word of god is pure and he is a
[38:45] shield unto them
[38:46] to put their trust in him and my brother
[38:48] and sister it's
[38:49] it's really not a half-hearted you know
[38:52] we can't just kind of trust him today
[38:54] not trusting tomorrow i can trust him
[38:56] with this but i can't trust him with my
[38:58] finances i
[38:59] can't trust him with this but i can
[39:00] trust him here i can't trust him with my
[39:03] marriage but i can trust him
[39:05] with this or you understand what i'm
[39:08] saying
[39:10] you see we've just got to trust him we
[39:12] just got to say lord
[39:14] you're in control and i'm here father
[39:17] thy will not my will be done
[39:21] amen and you know sometimes i think one
[39:24] of the
[39:25] things i just study and brother branham
[39:27] makes this statement
[39:28] and i certainly repeat it because i i
[39:32] see it as
[39:32] absolute truth not just because he said
[39:34] it but you know
[39:36] sometimes a minister might have a little
[39:39] gift and he gets raised up in that gift
[39:41] and he starts
[39:42] to feel like somehow that that gift is
[39:44] him
[39:45] in the sense that he did this or he
[39:47] accomplished this or he prayed the
[39:49] prayer of faith or prayer of healing or
[39:52] he prayed for someone's deliverance and
[39:54] and he does that and
[39:56] and what happened is is then vanity
[39:59] starts to move in in our midst and
[40:01] we start to feel like that we have
[40:03] accomplished something and
[40:04] and ultimately there's only one way that
[40:07] we can move forward
[40:09] especially as a son of god we will
[40:11] ultimately be put to a test and
[40:14] reminded of how little we
[40:17] are
[40:22] verse 9 says lest i be full and deny
[40:24] thee
[40:26] lord never let us come to that place
[40:30] now i want to touch upon this quickly
[40:33] as we move forward tonight there's so
[40:36] much here and i i'm sorry i
[40:39] just tried to not skip over anything
[40:42] but verse 14 says there is a generation
[40:45] actually it starts uh up further but we
[40:48] close this out
[40:49] a generation whose teeth are his swords
[40:51] and their jaw
[40:53] teeth as knives to devour the poor from
[40:56] off the earth
[40:57] you notice we've never had a nation
[40:59] never had a season a time of people it's
[41:01] not just our nation but
[41:03] that words have become so powerful
[41:10] you'll have someone in the right
[41:12] position and they'll say i believe this
[41:14] person
[41:15] that i believe they're this
[41:18] and if it catches what do they call that
[41:21] uh it's trending
[41:24] it's trending isn't it something the
[41:25] gospel in this world is never trending
[41:30] it's always something destructive it's
[41:32] always something negative it's always
[41:33] something perverse
[41:35] that's trending but you
[41:38] see my brother and sister
[41:44] i find humor in this and i hope you do
[41:45] too
[41:47] the young lady greta thundberg
[41:50] stood before the united nations and told
[41:52] them how horrible they was they're
[41:54] destroying her future and
[41:55] she has no future now because they've
[41:57] stolen it from her
[41:59] but yet in europe at a big convention
[42:02] someone figured out what car she was
[42:03] driving and it was clear full of empty
[42:05] plastic water bottles and mcdonald's
[42:07] wrappers
[42:08] the very thing she said was a curse to
[42:10] them
[42:12] but you see in the moment they believe
[42:14] what they're saying in the moment they
[42:16] believe they are these champions of
[42:18] something
[42:20] and we don't want to be that kind of
[42:22] champion my brother and sister that
[42:23] we walk out and and say well i'm this
[42:26] and i'm that but
[42:27] we can't live it we we don't really even
[42:30] have a desire the desire is more to hide
[42:32] what we are
[42:33] than to have what we are exposed but
[42:35] that's not what the word of god said the
[42:37] word of god says whatever's done in
[42:38] secret
[42:39] i will make known openly and i say my
[42:41] brother and sister
[42:42] i am as a man have made many mistakes i
[42:45] would not want brought before this
[42:47] and i place them under the blood of
[42:48] jesus christ and i can walk free
[42:51] with a good conscience with a confidence
[42:53] in god because i know who i am
[42:55] i know that what god has done but we see
[42:58] these last verses here talking
[43:01] about a generation that curseth their
[43:03] father and doesn't bless their mother
[43:05] a generation that's pure in their own
[43:07] eyes oh god help us not to be that
[43:09] generation
[43:10] yet is not washed from their filthiness
[43:13] a generation
[43:14] how lofty are their eyes and their
[43:16] eyelids are lifted up
[43:17] there's something so uh important within
[43:20] themselves that they feel
[43:22] that that they have accomplished but
[43:25] we'll look at the bible saints and we'll
[43:27] see that through the bible
[43:28] uh you could do a very quick study maybe
[43:31] when you get home or
[43:32] tomorrow if you want or not at all if
[43:35] you don't want but
[43:36] you look through the bible and see how
[43:38] the bible categorizes or brings out
[43:40] generations
[43:42] it lays it down that generations my
[43:44] brothers and sisters can be
[43:46] accounted in a family bloodline and
[43:48] these are the generations
[43:50] and it lays them all out and you see
[43:52] who's a part of that
[43:54] in those generations and uh generations
[43:57] are also used as a timeline
[44:00] it's bringing down uh placing it by
[44:02] generations coming
[44:04] and what will take place in in in these
[44:06] time places
[44:07] there's a a a the timeline of that if
[44:10] you've
[44:11] ever looked my brother and sister at the
[44:14] uh
[44:14] i'm sure you've saw the chart that folds
[44:16] out and it starts
[44:18] with um adam and goes right down through
[44:22] the generation
[44:23] shows how they overlapped in time in
[44:25] their positions
[44:26] when they passed from this earth and all
[44:28] of this and it breaks down a generation
[44:30] you notice nobody's ever done one for
[44:33] the devil
[44:36] there's nobody's thought it was
[44:39] worthwhile to
[44:40] break down the generations of lucifer
[44:44] but you know he has progeny
[44:48] he's got those that carry the family
[44:51] legacy
[44:54] amen the bible says that the generations
[44:56] of some are cursed
[44:58] oh my my brother and sister we certainly
[45:00] don't identify with that do we
[45:03] but it says the generations of some are
[45:05] blessed
[45:06] i say amen oh god let us
[45:09] raise forth families in the natural and
[45:12] spiritual families
[45:13] that would be the generations carrying a
[45:15] blessing going forward
[45:17] that our children would be able at some
[45:19] point in their life
[45:20] raise up and say thank you lord i was
[45:23] blessed to be the son or the daughter
[45:25] and their parents name of their lineage
[45:28] going back grandfathers maybe even great
[45:30] grandfathers
[45:31] but the devil would like to break that
[45:33] lineage he would like to break it and
[45:34] say you know
[45:35] they was able to serve for a season but
[45:38] when i come and he calls it truth and
[45:40] my brother and sister people like to use
[45:42] a really nice big fancy words
[45:45] they like to make it sound sophisticated
[45:48] but i'll just bring it right down
[45:50] we either recognize who we are as sons
[45:53] and daughters of god
[45:55] or we don't it's that simple we don't
[45:58] need to use a whole bunch of big
[46:00] words you know i i could try to dazzle
[46:03] you with some of those but you might say
[46:05] you didn't pronounce that correct
[46:06] brother paul doesn't matter we don't
[46:08] need those
[46:09] my brother and sister i want to be
[46:10] identified i want you to be identified
[46:13] as the generations that carried the pure
[46:16] word of god
[46:17] generations that could stand up and say
[46:18] you know what i had the word of god and
[46:21] in the hour when i needed it
[46:23] you know my brother and sister people
[46:24] get all mistook about the third pull i
[46:26] like how that was brought
[46:28] out in there my brother and sister the
[46:29] third pull is not something for us to
[46:32] just come
[46:33] and it's now a debate the seventh seal
[46:35] being open closed
[46:36] is not something god brought for us just
[46:38] to debate these are the promises of
[46:40] almighty god this is not a
[46:42] theologian-minded man over here in the
[46:44] message
[46:45] and one over here arguing points in
[46:47] quotes in scripture
[46:48] this is revelation that god comes down
[46:51] then in the
[46:51] hour of need and i i wasn't going to
[46:54] listen to that brother vasily i thought
[46:55] i'll listen to it later
[46:57] but i thought well i'm just gonna listen
[46:59] to it and it struck me because it fit
[47:01] right with the thoughts that i was
[47:02] having
[47:03] the hour my brother and sister it's not
[47:05] for us to say
[47:06] it might be but it's for us to say it is
[47:10] amen for us to stand on the word and in
[47:13] that time of need have enough confidence
[47:15] in god
[47:16] to be able to stand up and say lord you
[47:18] are the master
[47:19] of the sea you are the one i tell you
[47:22] what my brother and sister now imagine
[47:24] there was some shock people there on the
[47:26] shore when they're thinking we've got to
[47:27] do cpr to this guy
[47:29] and he coughs and stands up hallelujah
[47:31] i'm telling you because prayer is
[47:33] answered god answers our prayer
[47:35] the word says that our prayers come up
[47:37] before him
[47:38] as a sweet odor
[47:42] this is not something he says well i'm
[47:44] gonna ignore that i don't like that
[47:47] you've all done that smelled something
[47:50] maybe it's a flower
[47:52] you know how in our neighborhood they
[47:54] have a lot of mint fields
[47:57] they've started to cut them when i drive
[48:00] by one of them fields i feel like just
[48:02] backing up and rolling the window down
[48:06] smells so good if we could envision
[48:09] that's what our prayers
[48:11] come before god not whether he heard it
[48:13] or not
[48:14] did my prayer hit the ceiling just go
[48:16] away no sir
[48:18] a sweet odor but you know the word of
[48:21] god as i've spoke to you many times it's
[48:23] not self-fulfilling
[48:27] see the presence of god comes where he's
[48:29] made welcome
[48:30] he doesn't just want to hear you pray he
[48:33] wants you
[48:34] to welcome him he wants you to
[48:37] create the atmosphere that's why we
[48:40] should never pray like we're beggars
[48:42] that's right we should pray like we are
[48:44] sons and daughters of god
[48:46] not come as it were sometimes our
[48:48] emotional state sometimes the condition
[48:50] that we are in
[48:51] uh make us sound like we are begging but
[48:53] it is the difference of the spirit
[48:55] because
[48:55] one can be broken in their spirit and
[48:57] crying out to god
[48:59] but yet praying and crying out in
[49:01] confidence
[49:04] or we can simply come like the man that
[49:07] might approach you on this street
[49:09] oh flattery might work with this man oh
[49:13] kind
[49:14] sir looks like all is well with you
[49:17] could you please spare a poor beggar
[49:20] like me
[49:21] cut through the trash what's wrong with
[49:23] your life why are you here
[49:25] you know i found that works really well
[49:27] because the ones that are genuine
[49:29] will actually break down and tell you i
[49:31] i had a good family i did this i did
[49:33] that i blew it all and
[49:35] i just lost hope and somehow i ended up
[49:37] here and this is the state of my life
[49:39] but others say no oh
[49:40] no you know it's all about what you're
[49:42] going to do for me
[49:44] no i'm sorry i'm the kind of man i want
[49:45] to know how you got here
[49:47] because that's how we get you out of
[49:48] here
[49:50] right so we look at that and
[49:55] we trust god too see that
[49:59] the generations and to make a claim
[50:03] my brother and sister tie this back real
[50:05] quickly just to be able to move on
[50:09] those that put the blood over the door
[50:14] had revelation or understanding or just
[50:17] simply
[50:17] simple obedience now many of them i
[50:21] would opt that it was simple obedience
[50:23] that they put the blood
[50:24] over the door because we see their
[50:27] future
[50:30] actions if it had been revelation
[50:34] that put the blood over the door it
[50:36] would have been revelation at the red
[50:38] sea it would have been revelation in the
[50:40] wilderness of sin
[50:41] it would have been revelation that
[50:42] kadish barnea would have been revelation
[50:44] taking them across
[50:45] but it wasn't it was just obedience
[50:48] what we need is a revelation that
[50:50] obedience is part of it
[50:51] but it's got to come from the heart and
[50:53] it's not just i did this
[50:54] check i did this check he said do this
[50:57] check
[50:58] it's got to come to a place that will be
[51:01] and i i hope that i can
[51:03] articulate this to you in the next few
[51:04] minutes but you see my brother and
[51:06] sister it comes
[51:07] that we are a generation that has by the
[51:10] word of god
[51:11] god been declared to be a blessed
[51:13] generation
[51:14] now look uh speaking of behavior taking
[51:18] place in a specified time i
[51:19] i didn't give this uh to brother alex
[51:24] and i should have just to put it here
[51:26] but you know the scripture second
[51:28] timothy the third chapter
[51:29] and this talks about how in the last
[51:32] days
[51:33] perilous times shall come and it
[51:35] describes all those things that are
[51:37] wrong right lovers of their own selves
[51:38] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[51:41] disobedient
[51:42] uh without natural affection truce
[51:43] bakers false accusers incontinent
[51:46] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[51:48] pleasure
[51:49] more than lovers of god and this is what
[51:51] i really wanted to have
[51:52] having a form of godliness but denying
[51:55] the power
[51:56] thereof my brother and sister having the
[51:58] form means nothing
[52:00] if you have denied the power of the word
[52:03] in our lives
[52:04] if we come to the place that we feel
[52:06] like well i've done all this i've been
[52:08] to church my parents raised me in the
[52:10] church and
[52:11] and it doesn't seem to have made any
[52:13] difference it just doesn't work i think
[52:15] i won't even bother trying to serve god
[52:18] you are working on the form what we got
[52:20] to do is get away from the form
[52:22] and get into the relationship amen
[52:25] because you see
[52:26] we we don't need to just know this
[52:28] message we don't need to just know our
[52:30] bible
[52:31] and you know how i feel about that my
[52:32] brother and sister when people say well
[52:34] do you believe the message
[52:36] yes i tell you what i believe the
[52:38] message with all of my heart
[52:40] here is the message to our hour
[52:43] here is the word did god send a prophet
[52:46] to break this down
[52:47] and tie the loose ends together that we
[52:49] would be able to look in the word of god
[52:51] now i hope i can articulate this to you
[52:54] because you see my brother and sister
[52:56] it's not just about we have a message
[52:58] there's a lot of people have a message
[53:00] and they'll have your wallet if you
[53:01] ain't careful
[53:08] you know sometimes i wonder you know
[53:09] brother brown i'm kind of eluded that
[53:11] there would come a day that god would
[53:12] just name names over the pulpit
[53:14] i've been working on my list
[53:21] glad somebody thought that was funny but
[53:24] that's not what god's looking at
[53:27] he's talking about a sovereign moving of
[53:29] the holy spirit
[53:30] not to shame an individual but in the
[53:33] right
[53:34] moment to expose
[53:37] the individual no sir the devil
[53:42] god saving the individual exposing the
[53:45] spirit that's binding that individual
[53:47] that's why some preacher that would ever
[53:49] name a name or
[53:50] or come down to do to expose someone's
[53:53] sin
[53:54] they might be sincere but they're
[53:56] sincerely wrong
[53:57] amen so we look at this and see now this
[54:00] is a timeline right because generations
[54:02] also can be brought to uh expand or show
[54:06] a timeline
[54:07] and we see here in ii timothy here is a
[54:10] timeline
[54:10] last days perilous times this is what
[54:13] will happen now here brother branham
[54:16] says in the pool of bethesda
[54:18] i thought i would read this scripture
[54:20] that you would understand that the holy
[54:21] spirit that was upon jesus
[54:23] is on this church today
[54:27] can someone give me a real amen this is
[54:30] not we just have another form of
[54:31] religion
[54:33] this jesus christ right here in our
[54:34] midst today my brother and sister the
[54:36] holy spirit
[54:37] and moving in the same manner as the
[54:40] robe of elijah fell down on elisha
[54:42] so these things that i do greater shall
[54:44] you for i go into my father
[54:46] and the robe fell on the day of
[54:48] pentecost that brought glory back
[54:50] to his people that god lives in his
[54:52] church and his spirit
[54:53] moves upon his people so if the spirit
[54:57] is not moving upon the people
[54:58] something's wrong in our church
[55:01] man thanks come on yes thank you
[55:06] we have to acknowledge if the holy
[55:08] spirit's not moving
[55:09] in our midst church we have to
[55:12] acknowledge
[55:13] there's a problem not just well the
[55:16] preacher had an off day
[55:19] ain't got nothing to do with the
[55:20] preacher
[55:24] come on who's driving this church saints
[55:32] who's trying to need the preacher if it
[55:35] is we got a problem
[55:38] the holy spirit coming down moving in
[55:40] our midst god
[55:41] lives in his church and his spirit moves
[55:44] upon his people
[55:45] we must first realize that we're living
[55:48] in a day
[55:48] of skeptic and i'll tell you in the last
[55:51] half a dozen
[55:52] to ten years or something we have sure
[55:55] seen the skeptics pop out
[55:57] you know that have you ever noticed i i
[56:00] jokingly say this to put it in a context
[56:02] because you know
[56:03] me simple here do you know that the
[56:06] go head which i know you all love go
[56:08] heads they're just the most
[56:09] wonderful beautiful plants ever
[56:13] got that beautiful little yellow flower
[56:16] you don't want to get down on your hands
[56:17] and knees to admire it though
[56:21] do you know the goat head the way god
[56:24] made it
[56:25] after everything else has dried up and
[56:28] is starting to
[56:29] fade away is when the goat head
[56:32] sprouts and i put it in this context
[56:36] we've sprayed every weed on the farm
[56:38] everything's just brown and you know on
[56:41] the ditch banks and the roads and we're
[56:43] just happy with ourselves and you come
[56:44] back a couple days later and it's all
[56:46] green
[56:48] so in the last days i mean let's face it
[56:51] saints
[56:52] if you said brother paul um you got to
[56:54] choose between the two weeds on your
[56:56] farm
[56:57] you either get kosher or you get go
[57:00] ahead
[57:02] i would choose kosher any day of the
[57:04] week
[57:05] because all you got to do is show it the
[57:07] roundup jug and it dies
[57:12] but look what happens in the last day
[57:17] after all these other things have come
[57:20] then revealed the skeptic comes right up
[57:24] in the last day why because the devil
[57:28] is waiting until you are exhausted from
[57:30] your
[57:31] uh you might say endurance test uh
[57:33] you're exhausted from
[57:34] this race of life and then he comes
[57:37] right in
[57:38] is this not the truth when we get
[57:40] discouraged already when we
[57:42] have troubles in our life the wheels
[57:44] fall off the wagon
[57:45] and then the devil comes right in like a
[57:47] flood
[57:48] at that moment when you have just been
[57:50] through revival and you are prayed up
[57:52] and you're ready to go out and knock the
[57:54] devil for a loop
[57:55] my brother and sister he just goes and
[57:56] sits down drinks lemonade
[57:59] but when you have become discouraged he
[58:01] shows right up and he's always got
[58:03] someone to tell you
[58:04] why this isn't truth always someone out
[58:07] there
[58:12] generation of people who will not
[58:14] believe jesus said though the dead be
[58:16] raised they wouldn't believe
[58:18] them words has to be fulfilled somebody
[58:22] now look here now 90 percent that satan
[58:26] promised he would have
[58:27] has to be on the other side we know that
[58:29] it has
[58:30] no matter what would take place they
[58:32] still would not believe it
[58:34] they'll try to find some way to believe
[58:36] different
[58:38] now this is kind of like the modern term
[58:40] cognitive dissonance
[58:42] right they people use that they say well
[58:45] you're denying
[58:46] all the evidence that's in front of you
[58:48] all the facts that are in front of you
[58:50] you deny them my brother and sister
[58:52] that's what it takes to be a real
[58:53] christian because
[58:54] you just have to go drive down through
[58:56] the town of nampa in the middle of the
[58:58] night on a friday night
[59:00] and all the things you can actually see
[59:02] smell hear
[59:03] taste so to speak you know what i mean
[59:05] is there would tell you that there's
[59:06] probably not a god on this earth
[59:11] i've been places my brother and sister
[59:15] i i wouldn't go into that that might be
[59:16] a little bit to throw you for a loop
[59:19] but i have lived in a world
[59:22] that the evidence that the devil has
[59:25] control
[59:27] is very evident
[59:31] i'll leave it at that they try to find
[59:33] some way to believe different even our
[59:34] master was called beelzebub
[59:36] a spiritualist and how much more will
[59:38] they call them that's of his household
[59:40] we have to contend with that is that not
[59:42] true but brother that doesn't shake my
[59:44] faith one bit
[59:45] see if this sounded discouraging i
[59:47] needed you to just hang on long enough
[59:49] to get a hold of this it don't shake my
[59:51] faith a bit
[59:51] it only increases my faith in him for
[59:54] all that live
[59:54] godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[59:57] persecution
[59:58] and here's the thing i want to catch
[1:00:01] back coming back into this now
[1:00:03] and the mystery to me was as plain as
[1:00:05] the word was being taught
[1:00:06] that men and women can't understand one
[1:00:09] of the greatest mysteries on this earth
[1:00:11] my brother and sister is someone can
[1:00:12] read a scripture
[1:00:15] and they can't see it applies they can't
[1:00:18] see the relevance of that scripture they
[1:00:20] they can't put it together and if you
[1:00:23] you know it's interesting and
[1:00:24] and i don't encourage you to do this but
[1:00:26] i will just say it i
[1:00:28] i kind of sometimes would just do it for
[1:00:30] entertainment sitting in a tractor you
[1:00:32] know it
[1:00:32] and um you go to the right uh radio
[1:00:35] station
[1:00:36] and there will be men like hank anagraf
[1:00:38] come on there and
[1:00:39] they'll be the bible answer man and
[1:00:41] they'll be these different things and
[1:00:42] people call in and say i was reading my
[1:00:44] bible and i read this scripture
[1:00:46] and i i just can't make heads or tales
[1:00:48] of it i asked my pastor he don't have an
[1:00:50] answer either
[1:00:51] i'm calling you to get an answer and i'm
[1:00:53] sitting there jumping up and down inside
[1:00:55] the tractor saying can i answer can i
[1:00:57] answer can i answer
[1:00:59] but you see my brother and sister
[1:01:01] without revelation without god
[1:01:02] opening that and then you see these men
[1:01:05] trying to explain it
[1:01:06] and they're like well you know from the
[1:01:08] sub-region of this uh the aramic says
[1:01:10] this and
[1:01:11] we this and we do that and literally one
[1:01:14] man i was proud of the man
[1:01:16] he comes down to the end of this like
[1:01:18] 10-minute discourse about an answer to
[1:01:20] this deal and the guy goes uh you
[1:01:21] never answered my question
[1:01:25] this over national radio you know but
[1:01:27] what did he do he gave him a long deal
[1:01:29] and he goes no i did answer and he goes
[1:01:30] no you didn't answer my question click
[1:01:32] he shuts him off
[1:01:35] there's only one that can give the
[1:01:36] answer my brother and sister and that's
[1:01:38] jesus christ
[1:01:39] himself because he interprets his own
[1:01:41] word
[1:01:42] oh thank the lord that he come down to
[1:01:44] you and i and said just a second
[1:01:46] let me be an interpreter for you i'm
[1:01:48] your personal
[1:01:50] interpreter i'm not going to just
[1:01:51] interpret it for the preacher
[1:01:53] and he's going to try to explain it to
[1:01:55] you i'll come down to you
[1:01:57] and be your interpreter hallelujah
[1:02:01] hallelujah so it doesn't shake our faith
[1:02:04] one bit they live godly
[1:02:06] they suffer persecution the mystery is
[1:02:09] as the word being taught that men and
[1:02:10] women
[1:02:11] can't understand there's a real mystery
[1:02:13] truly did isaiah say you have ears but
[1:02:15] can't hear it
[1:02:16] eyes but can't see it and we see the
[1:02:18] very evidence of that coming forth
[1:02:20] it's it's very very strong in coming
[1:02:23] forth my brother and sister in the day
[1:02:25] that we live in
[1:02:26] now this is a thing that that we
[1:02:29] increasingly are facing
[1:02:31] i i i you know sometimes we live in a
[1:02:34] little different world
[1:02:35] uh and and that reminds me god bless you
[1:02:38] greetings from brother jewell
[1:02:39] sends greetings to each and every one of
[1:02:41] you today him and sister vanessa
[1:02:44] amen but we're coming to a time now my
[1:02:47] brother and sister more and more
[1:02:49] that people are wanting the message
[1:02:51] explained
[1:02:52] to them yes sir so we can do well
[1:02:56] if we can look up all the words and we
[1:02:58] have all these things we have
[1:03:00] all of our reference guides and we can
[1:03:02] come and go through that
[1:03:04] and then we explain as though we had a
[1:03:06] first-hand experience
[1:03:08] of what that was and and so as people
[1:03:11] are wanting
[1:03:11] the message explained it is showing
[1:03:14] there is a lack of revelation
[1:03:16] now i'm not i'm not faulting please
[1:03:18] don't think i'm being critical of this
[1:03:20] sometimes it's the wrong teaching people
[1:03:23] are being encouraged to dig into the
[1:03:25] message as though they are
[1:03:26] studying a science project a
[1:03:29] mathematical problem or something of
[1:03:31] that nature
[1:03:32] to dig into it in that realm that now if
[1:03:35] this
[1:03:35] is this i must be able to go over here
[1:03:38] and find
[1:03:39] a reference of time for this i must be
[1:03:42] able to find a reason
[1:03:44] i must be able to find an explanation
[1:03:47] but that's not how god works that's not
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:50] the method or the plan that god chose
[1:03:52] and so
[1:03:53] it is that as people are increasingly
[1:03:57] wanting the message explained they're
[1:03:59] increasingly moving into an intellectual
[1:04:01] discourse
[1:04:02] we're moving into a well god sent a
[1:04:04] prophet and we can go to a scripture and
[1:04:06] we can go to a scripture
[1:04:07] and this is this because we can go to a
[1:04:08] scripture and that's great my brother
[1:04:10] and sister we
[1:04:11] should know our bible as good as a
[1:04:13] baptist
[1:04:16] but do we but
[1:04:21] knowing your bible and being able to say
[1:04:22] it's this verse it's this verse it's a
[1:04:24] chapter doesn't do anything
[1:04:26] if it's just an intellectual discourse
[1:04:31] an intellectual tutorial i come across
[1:04:33] the other day
[1:04:34] that uh for you know fairly cheap i
[1:04:36] thought you know like 29.95 or something
[1:04:39] uh you can get this one-year course
[1:04:41] where every week they send you
[1:04:43] these studies these lessons these deals
[1:04:46] and at the end of the year
[1:04:47] they assure you that you will be able to
[1:04:49] answer anyone's questions concerning the
[1:04:52] bible
[1:04:54] that's good but remember those people
[1:04:59] coming and saying um we see the
[1:05:02] gift of god moving and
[1:05:06] i've got cash here if you can
[1:05:10] give me a portion
[1:05:16] it's the day we live in yes
[1:05:20] simon you go ahead and
[1:05:23] do that and we can set you up on monthly
[1:05:25] payments
[1:05:27] no sir what was the answer your curse
[1:05:30] take you
[1:05:31] and your money and go
[1:05:35] you're cursed
[1:05:39] so there's no way my brother and sister
[1:05:42] that we come into this day and god's
[1:05:43] gonna let us just pay our tithes and
[1:05:45] give our offerings and come to church
[1:05:47] as though it was some intellectual
[1:05:49] discourse that we go home
[1:05:52] from wednesday and sunday a little more
[1:05:53] educated
[1:05:55] in the message
[1:05:59] now you know i don't want anyone to lift
[1:06:00] a hand i don't want anyone to make a
[1:06:02] comment i don't want
[1:06:02] no one to say amen or yea amen or yeoman
[1:06:05] or whatever
[1:06:06] but i want to ask you how many of us are
[1:06:08] praying for revelation
[1:06:11] prophet of god said it he laid it out
[1:06:13] really strong he didn't say this is
[1:06:15] option number 25
[1:06:17] or when nothing else works my brother
[1:06:18] and sister he said above and beyond
[1:06:20] these things we
[1:06:22] should be praying for revelation
[1:06:23] otherwise grace tabernacle
[1:06:25] has a nice intellectual discourse
[1:06:29] with it should stimulate each one of us
[1:06:31] to pray for revelation
[1:06:33] that lord you'd reveal yourself and your
[1:06:35] word to me like
[1:06:36] never before because where does
[1:06:40] rapturing faith come from
[1:06:42] our iq our memorization our
[1:06:45] abilities no sir
[1:06:49] rapturing faith cometh from hearing the
[1:06:51] word of god
[1:06:52] and the hearing of the word isn't just
[1:06:54] we put on a tape we listen to the
[1:06:56] preacher
[1:06:57] it's hearing the voice
[1:07:00] of almighty god
[1:07:04] see so they can't see it
[1:07:09] now i tell you what kind of tutorial we
[1:07:13] need i believe in tutorials
[1:07:14] you know that i love them i love
[1:07:17] tutorials
[1:07:20] there is the two knee tutorial
[1:07:26] it's where you get down on two knees and
[1:07:29] god tutors you
[1:07:32] there is the inspiration of the holy
[1:07:35] spirit tutorial
[1:07:37] where you might be driving down the road
[1:07:40] thinking about something that you read
[1:07:43] or heard
[1:07:44] and suddenly the mind is open
[1:07:48] and you say praise god i never saw that
[1:07:51] before
[1:07:52] i like that tutorial also that's the one
[1:07:55] where god
[1:07:56] opens the window of his word to us and
[1:07:58] something we've heard spoken for maybe
[1:08:00] days weeks months or years suddenly is
[1:08:03] made real to us
[1:08:04] hallelujah what is it it's revelation in
[1:08:07] the soul
[1:08:08] my brother and sister we can do fine
[1:08:09] with revelation in our mind i i like
[1:08:12] that you know
[1:08:12] i can tell you that many many times
[1:08:15] after the fact
[1:08:16] and sometimes in the middle of the night
[1:08:18] i will wake up and i believe you're
[1:08:20] probably the same way
[1:08:21] you'll wake up and you'll go hmm that's
[1:08:23] how to fix that
[1:08:26] oh that's what i need to do i'm talking
[1:08:29] about natural carnal type things amen
[1:08:31] you wake up in the middle of night oh
[1:08:33] that's why that won't work
[1:08:35] that's good but how about we open the
[1:08:38] door
[1:08:39] that god would come and in the stillness
[1:08:42] of the midnight
[1:08:43] hour wake up and say lord i see it
[1:08:46] i see the word that you were trying to
[1:08:48] show me that's been preached to me
[1:08:50] over and over and over again now look my
[1:08:53] brother and sister i'll just throw this
[1:08:54] out there to you
[1:08:55] hopefully i don't offend anyone but you
[1:08:58] look at this my brother and sister as
[1:08:59] the prophet of god is talking about the
[1:09:01] tent vision
[1:09:01] and everybody grasp the holds of that
[1:09:03] and they're like okay the prophet's got
[1:09:05] to come back
[1:09:06] there's going to be a service he's going
[1:09:08] to be in there
[1:09:09] people are going to walk into this and
[1:09:11] they're going to walk out they didn't
[1:09:12] know what happened
[1:09:13] but something changed their life forever
[1:09:16] and people took that
[1:09:17] and you might say a literal physical
[1:09:20] sense
[1:09:20] and it was there caught up in that now
[1:09:22] it never came to pass as the prophet of
[1:09:24] god shared it
[1:09:26] because it was not a physical event
[1:09:29] in the flesh taking place it was a
[1:09:32] spiritual revelation
[1:09:34] it was a spiritual opening to the soul
[1:09:37] and that little room my brother and
[1:09:39] sister was a holy ghost coming down
[1:09:41] in this little room right here and he
[1:09:43] was declaring not
[1:09:45] just to a prophet but he was declaring
[1:09:47] to
[1:09:48] those who were under that dispensational
[1:09:51] ministry
[1:09:54] right he was the first fruit take it
[1:09:56] back to your bible he was the first
[1:09:58] fruit
[1:09:59] and so he was sharing then of that first
[1:10:02] fruit to us
[1:10:03] and by revelation we catch that that as
[1:10:06] a but because he says you know what
[1:10:08] when this third poll happens it will not
[1:10:10] be a public event it will not be a
[1:10:13] public uh
[1:10:14] expose and so it's there as the holy
[1:10:16] spirit comes
[1:10:17] and moves down into the soul of sons and
[1:10:20] daughters of god
[1:10:21] they're having a life-changing event and
[1:10:23] the world out here is not going to be
[1:10:25] able to copy that
[1:10:26] they're not going to have a blueprint
[1:10:28] god designed the prophet of god says
[1:10:30] you don't even speak those things you
[1:10:31] don't even want the devil to know
[1:10:35] but what is it something changing
[1:10:39] and what it does is it changes us from
[1:10:41] being church going message believers
[1:10:44] to bible believing bible
[1:10:48] living bible expressing
[1:10:51] bible worshiping believers
[1:10:55] there's quite a difference my brother
[1:10:58] and sister there's quite a difference
[1:11:04] i'll skip over some of these little
[1:11:05] details that i had thrown in but
[1:11:08] you look at this see satan's made this
[1:11:11] promise
[1:11:12] but you see this sermon
[1:11:17] very i loved it just a lot to me it just
[1:11:20] really spoke to me
[1:11:22] you know god meets with sons of men many
[1:11:24] times in different forms and in
[1:11:26] different groups
[1:11:27] different councils different numbers one
[1:11:29] time he met with them
[1:11:30] where there were 500 gathered together
[1:11:33] one time he met with them and there was
[1:11:35] 70 together he met with him when there
[1:11:37] was 12 gathered together
[1:11:39] then he met with them when they were
[1:11:40] three gathered together and where
[1:11:42] one god meets wherever men
[1:11:46] will gather together he has promised to
[1:11:49] meet
[1:11:50] and so this afternoon it's most surely
[1:11:52] that he is here to
[1:11:54] meet with us today in this nice
[1:11:56] gathering of people here in this
[1:11:57] auditorium this afternoon can someone
[1:11:59] say amen
[1:12:00] amen we know god will meet us here he
[1:12:02] made that promise
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:05] he didn't throw anything in now i'll
[1:12:07] meet you there
[1:12:08] if this man preaches or i'll meet you
[1:12:12] there if that man preaches
[1:12:17] he said he would meet us here
[1:12:24] god loves to commune with his servants
[1:12:29] he loves to make himself known to sons
[1:12:31] of men he loves to show his power
[1:12:33] any bible reader who reads the bible
[1:12:34] knows that god loves to display his
[1:12:36] power
[1:12:37] look at this now i like this
[1:12:40] because sometimes we'll say well i just
[1:12:42] don't know why this is happening i don't
[1:12:43] know you guys probably never ever said
[1:12:45] that in your life i don't know why this
[1:12:46] is happening
[1:12:48] he brings men into situations they
[1:12:49] cannot figure out in order to show them
[1:12:51] that he loves them and leads them
[1:12:54] look at israel on their journey what was
[1:12:56] the type of the journey today
[1:12:57] so let's we can just go right back we
[1:12:59] obviously won't do it tonight but we can
[1:13:00] go right back
[1:13:01] just start reading my brother and sister
[1:13:04] starting with the promise
[1:13:05] to israel that they would sojourn for
[1:13:08] 400 years
[1:13:09] and that they would be brought out and
[1:13:11] you can look through and see how it all
[1:13:13] fits perfectly
[1:13:14] and here we are today amen and so it's
[1:13:17] there
[1:13:25] look at israel on their journey type of
[1:13:27] this journey today
[1:13:28] how he would lead them right into
[1:13:30] death's trap
[1:13:33] then display his power
[1:13:37] so i want to reference this back to as i
[1:13:38] was sharing with you
[1:13:40] we put blood over the doorpost but we
[1:13:42] get to the red sea
[1:13:45] we followed moses's command that the
[1:13:48] lord said
[1:13:49] and put the blood over our doorpost now
[1:13:51] we're at the red sea
[1:13:53] and suddenly it's moses you
[1:13:56] brought us here to die
[1:14:01] wow it didn't take very long i hope our
[1:14:02] faith lasts longer than that
[1:14:05] i hope your faith in the word of god
[1:14:06] lasts longer than their faith did
[1:14:08] after seeing the supernatural imagine
[1:14:11] they got to look out the window and see
[1:14:13] the literal death angel flying down the
[1:14:15] street
[1:14:15] swooping into homes and the screams and
[1:14:17] moving on they saw that my brother and
[1:14:19] sister
[1:14:21] and yet in just a short time they're
[1:14:23] down here at the red sea you brought us
[1:14:25] here to die
[1:14:28] come on we don't want to be those kind
[1:14:30] of message believers we don't want to
[1:14:32] have a revival we don't have one
[1:14:33] a brother andrew brother jewel you know
[1:14:36] brother tim cross or one of these come
[1:14:38] and just preach us so happy we're
[1:14:39] shouting and singing in the next week
[1:14:41] wondering why god
[1:14:42] doesn't like us come on that's what
[1:14:44] happened in egypt
[1:14:46] god don't love me god don't love me
[1:14:48] brought me here to die
[1:14:51] i believe that's why god let me say
[1:14:55] let me find my spain look at israel the
[1:14:57] dirty type of journey today
[1:14:58] he would lead them right in death trap
[1:15:00] then display his power when favor would
[1:15:01] say i will let them go and then god said
[1:15:03] nope
[1:15:04] i'm going to harden his heart just in
[1:15:05] order to show his great power and i
[1:15:07] believe that's why god is letting things
[1:15:09] happen the way they are today
[1:15:10] that when this great rush finally comes
[1:15:12] he loves to show his power
[1:15:14] and display this great rush
[1:15:18] maybe the one that started a pandemic
[1:15:19] and he's talking about gonna
[1:15:22] have a a uh petroleum lockdown you can't
[1:15:26] prove you have a reason we're going to
[1:15:27] take your car away from you
[1:15:29] and you keep your house too cold or too
[1:15:31] warm we're going to do
[1:15:33] you see my brother and sister it's all
[1:15:34] about control yeah has nothing to do
[1:15:36] with the environment
[1:15:38] look the devil don't like the devil
[1:15:40] don't care about this earth
[1:15:43] it's just another tool
[1:15:47] this place loves the sun sons of men
[1:15:50] reading a few days ago this scripture
[1:15:52] has always been an outstanding one to me
[1:15:54] i seem to catch a new revelation come on
[1:15:57] i want you to catch that here's a
[1:15:59] prophet of god
[1:16:00] reading his bible and all of a sudden he
[1:16:02] catches a new revelation about something
[1:16:04] in scripture
[1:16:05] there wasn't an angel come down and
[1:16:07] reveal this scripture to him
[1:16:08] it was an anointing of the holy spirit
[1:16:10] within him reading the word
[1:16:12] and the word speaking back to him and i
[1:16:15] seem to catch a new revelation and you
[1:16:17] know god's word is so eternal
[1:16:18] and it's so inspired that it's not just
[1:16:20] for one occasion or for one
[1:16:22] generation the word of god is so eternal
[1:16:25] the same and the truth till it will the
[1:16:28] same word
[1:16:29] inspired the disciples it inspired the
[1:16:32] first robe despite
[1:16:33] disciples then the next as they followed
[1:16:35] down through the lutheran age down
[1:16:36] through the methodist age in every age
[1:16:38] just as efficient sufficient inspiring
[1:16:41] today to us
[1:16:42] as it was the first day it was given can
[1:16:44] someone say amen to that
[1:16:45] and if the word would stand a million
[1:16:47] years the word would still be just as
[1:16:49] inspired
[1:16:50] to the generations that will follow us
[1:16:52] as it is to us because it's perfect
[1:16:55] and it's always given for the time how
[1:16:58] great god does in his word
[1:17:01] how that even before the world was ever
[1:17:03] formed god at his infinite mercy
[1:17:05] and his empathy he he foresaw all things
[1:17:08] and before he ever spoke one word the
[1:17:10] bible said in the beginning was the word
[1:17:11] and the word was with god
[1:17:13] and the word was god and now the word
[1:17:14] becomes a part
[1:17:16] of himself then
[1:17:19] and then a word is a thought expressed
[1:17:22] and when god saw where his fellow worker
[1:17:24] with him
[1:17:25] satan which was the son of the morning
[1:17:29] had deceived him in a way
[1:17:31] that he had entrusted him with great
[1:17:33] things
[1:17:34] and he had perverted what god had
[1:17:35] created to make evil out of it
[1:17:37] god thought the whole thing in his mind
[1:17:39] and then he spoke it and it become
[1:17:41] true and it become part of him and can
[1:17:44] never
[1:17:44] never fail it's him he is the word and
[1:17:47] so god before the foundation of the
[1:17:49] world
[1:17:50] knew that you would be here
[1:17:53] i hope i'm not just reading i hope this
[1:17:55] inspires you
[1:17:56] amen knew that you would be here he knew
[1:17:59] you by name before the foundation of the
[1:18:01] world think of it
[1:18:01] many times we sing the song a new name
[1:18:04] written down in glory
[1:18:06] it was in air it was written down before
[1:18:08] there ever was
[1:18:09] a human being on the earth your name is
[1:18:12] written in the lamb's book of life amen
[1:18:14] think of it the bible said that jesus
[1:18:17] was the lamb of god slain before the
[1:18:19] foundation of the world
[1:18:20] taken four thousand years for that to
[1:18:22] materialize
[1:18:24] this is why saints this quote a long
[1:18:26] time ago is why
[1:18:27] i for a long time have spoke to you that
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:32] lamb being slain took place
[1:18:36] calvary was just an earthly expression
[1:18:38] of it that we could
[1:18:40] understand the price
[1:18:46] four thousand years later he was
[1:18:47] actually slain but when god spoke the
[1:18:49] word in the beginning he was slain right
[1:18:50] then because
[1:18:51] god's word can't fail see it and the
[1:18:54] bible said in revelation the last
[1:18:55] chapter of revelation that the beast
[1:18:57] would deceive all those
[1:18:58] that dwelled upon the earth whose names
[1:19:00] were not written in the lamb's book of
[1:19:02] life from the foundation of the world
[1:19:04] don't that make you happy
[1:19:07] ought to just make us just be able to
[1:19:09] jump up and shout and disrupt the whole
[1:19:11] service
[1:19:12] to realize my brother and sister it's
[1:19:14] not what happened today
[1:19:16] it's not what happened yesterday or last
[1:19:19] week or your mistake over here or your
[1:19:21] mistake over there
[1:19:23] he wrote your name in that book and that
[1:19:26] settled it
[1:19:27] hallelujah now we know that sons and
[1:19:30] daughters of god when they make a
[1:19:31] mistake amen they'll put it under the
[1:19:33] blood they won't just say i'm covered
[1:19:34] and go on they will put it under the
[1:19:36] blood
[1:19:37] amen don't that make you happy to think
[1:19:39] that our names were written before the
[1:19:41] foundation of the world
[1:19:42] when the lamb was slain our names was
[1:19:44] associated with him
[1:19:46] oh amen what a pitcher and what
[1:19:49] a truth isn't that beautiful i like that
[1:19:52] it just stirs my heart to realize
[1:19:55] it's not even today oh can i tell you
[1:19:58] all about today
[1:20:00] do you guys have enough time tissue
[1:20:04] you don't good because i don't even want
[1:20:07] to tell you
[1:20:08] there's a prophet of god as i read the
[1:20:09] quote to you sunday don't let that
[1:20:11] negative stuff come out of your mouth
[1:20:15] but just give you a hint
[1:20:22] didn't have a very good day
[1:20:26] yeah geocapitalist minded people you
[1:20:29] would understand what i'm talking about
[1:20:35] but none of that matters because by
[1:20:38] revelation
[1:20:40] my name is in that book
[1:20:43] what happened today doesn't
[1:20:46] even matter
[1:20:52] what mattered was when he spoke my name
[1:20:55] your name before the foundation of the
[1:20:57] world that's
[1:20:59] what mattered that was the only thing he
[1:21:01] said brother paul life's been treating
[1:21:03] us really rough
[1:21:04] well why don't you just go read the
[1:21:06] scripture just forget about reading your
[1:21:08] bank statement
[1:21:09] forget about reading all the letters
[1:21:11] that come in the mail to you and all the
[1:21:12] what people spout over the telephone to
[1:21:14] you
[1:21:15] why don't you just go read the word of
[1:21:17] god
[1:21:19] and then respond to it that's it
[1:21:23] he said that i
[1:21:27] am a son of god now look my brother and
[1:21:31] sister
[1:21:31] you see as these as i spoke earlier i
[1:21:34] want to just close this
[1:21:35] out as i spoke earlier you see we have
[1:21:38] these prophecies of a generation that
[1:21:40] won't respect father nor
[1:21:42] mother uh they they will gnash upon with
[1:21:44] their teeth
[1:21:45] they destroy it's just a terrible
[1:21:49] now that is a prophecy my brother and
[1:21:51] sister when you look in the word of god
[1:21:53] those words were spoken
[1:21:55] not as a might be but they were speaking
[1:21:58] in a complete uh um oh i won't use that
[1:22:02] word it's big and
[1:22:03] whatever cumbersome speaking in a
[1:22:06] complete total
[1:22:07] expression are you with me
[1:22:11] this generation is going to show up
[1:22:13] that's going to be this way they're
[1:22:14] going to behave like this
[1:22:15] this is going to be how they act this is
[1:22:17] how they think this is what they do
[1:22:19] and this is what they express and it's
[1:22:21] it's come to pass today
[1:22:23] every bit of that out of the book of
[1:22:24] proverbs 30th chapter has taken place
[1:22:27] right here today
[1:22:28] and the prophet of god in the quote i
[1:22:30] was going to make note of that but i
[1:22:31] didn't
[1:22:31] it's not just for one occasion so you
[1:22:34] say well we can see that took place here
[1:22:36] in history and here in history that's
[1:22:37] right and it's taken place again
[1:22:40] so we see this comes this word is
[1:22:42] literally as it were
[1:22:43] prophecy to you and i and so as we'll
[1:22:47] look at this
[1:22:48] and realize that this word of prophecy
[1:22:50] in proverbs is
[1:22:52] producing the generation of that
[1:22:54] prophecy
[1:22:56] true amen
[1:23:00] but we have a word that peter shared
[1:23:02] with us
[1:23:05] it too is prophecy and it says but
[1:23:10] ye well hallelujah
[1:23:15] brother alex and i are well
[1:23:18] you're saying his words are just
[1:23:22] as anchored in the word of god as the
[1:23:25] words
[1:23:25] of proverbs declaring what a generation
[1:23:28] will be like
[1:23:29] and here he says you're a chosen
[1:23:30] generation
[1:23:33] you are that generation now my brother
[1:23:34] and sister i want to tie you back real
[1:23:36] quick here
[1:23:37] the skeptics are going to tell you none
[1:23:39] of this applies
[1:23:41] we're just here until god comes and
[1:23:44] whatever happens and just do
[1:23:47] oh don't you say no i don't know brother
[1:23:49] paul it's not that way
[1:23:50] yeah i'm sorry i have way too many
[1:23:52] friends out there
[1:23:54] i got way too many i hear their
[1:23:56] expressions they're like you're just way
[1:23:59] way too radical paul you need to chill
[1:24:02] out paul
[1:24:03] we can just kind of do these things paul
[1:24:05] we can drink a little bit we can chew
[1:24:07] tobacco
[1:24:08] and we can dance once in a while and we
[1:24:11] can do these things
[1:24:12] and we're just as good a christian
[1:24:17] sounds good doesn't it
[1:24:21] strangely enough it doesn't sound good
[1:24:23] to us does it
[1:24:25] some would say yes
[1:24:29] but to you it doesn't sound good thank
[1:24:31] you lord
[1:24:33] thank you lord see you're hearing
[1:24:35] something different
[1:24:36] scribes your job description is to show
[1:24:39] praises to the king of kings and the
[1:24:41] lord of lords it would change our whole
[1:24:43] perspective
[1:24:44] of i make this mistake and i make that
[1:24:46] mistake amen
[1:24:47] you know what when you repent that comes
[1:24:49] as a sweet odor to god
[1:24:51] amen and when you praise him it comes
[1:24:53] and when you pray it comes
[1:24:55] all of this is coming up this is what
[1:24:56] god expected out of you
[1:24:58] so instead of looking at what i'm not
[1:25:00] look at what you are
[1:25:01] amen your sons and daughters of god you
[1:25:04] are that generation
[1:25:05] just as they were a generation to
[1:25:07] disrespect their parents
[1:25:08] and to be evil and gnash upon with their
[1:25:11] teeth and
[1:25:12] consume and destroy my brother and
[1:25:14] sister you're the generation that was
[1:25:16] called to bring praises to god
[1:25:18] you're the one that god said that's one
[1:25:20] i can choose amen that we could show for
[1:25:22] praises of him
[1:25:23] who called us out of darkness into his
[1:25:25] marvelous light
[1:25:27] i'll tell you what there's enough
[1:25:29] skeptics will tell you oh well this is
[1:25:31] wrong and that is wrong
[1:25:32] well one thing i'll tell you my brother
[1:25:34] and sister that and this is a little
[1:25:35] abrupt this is a little direct a little
[1:25:37] blunt
[1:25:38] but i'll tell you what when i look at
[1:25:40] these skeptics
[1:25:41] as a as we've we've read this scripture
[1:25:44] this is a time this is a season
[1:25:46] but when i look at these skeptics i look
[1:25:48] at them and say i don't like your
[1:25:49] theology
[1:25:50] i don't like what you said here i don't
[1:25:51] like what you did there i don't like
[1:25:53] that you don't like the message
[1:25:55] that's what they think we think but you
[1:25:58] know what i'm really doing
[1:26:01] i'm looking at their life
[1:26:05] and something in me says i don't want
[1:26:08] that life
[1:26:10] that's not the life i want it's not an
[1:26:13] argument about what is and what isn't
[1:26:15] and who is and who isn't and whatever
[1:26:18] i don't want that life
[1:26:27] maybe it's because we've been called
[1:26:28] into the light
[1:26:31] the light just showed us this isn't what
[1:26:33] you want
[1:26:34] now look one more little bit of word of
[1:26:37] god that i would say
[1:26:38] i take this kind of prophecy john 15 15.
[1:26:43] see now look at this henceforth i call
[1:26:44] you not servants
[1:26:47] see early on in scripture he's talking
[1:26:48] about servants
[1:26:50] here he says henceforth i call you not
[1:26:52] servants this is our lord jesus you got
[1:26:54] a red letter bible
[1:26:55] this would be in red letter for the
[1:26:57] servant
[1:26:58] knoweth not what his lord doeth
[1:27:02] see here's here's a giant step from just
[1:27:05] being a
[1:27:06] servant we've stepped into it now
[1:27:09] we're not just blindly following but he
[1:27:11] says right here
[1:27:12] a servant knoweth not what his lord
[1:27:14] doeth but i have called you
[1:27:16] friends for all things that i have heard
[1:27:19] of my father
[1:27:20] i have past tense made known
[1:27:24] unto you hallelujah how glorious we're
[1:27:27] not sitting here now
[1:27:28] just dumbfounded about what god wants
[1:27:30] out of us not dumbfounded about the life
[1:27:33] that we're called to
[1:27:34] but we have revelation hallelujah
[1:27:37] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:27:39] you
[1:27:40] and ordained you that you should go and
[1:27:43] bring forth fruit
[1:27:44] and that your fruit should remain that
[1:27:47] soul
[1:27:48] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:27:50] my name he may give it
[1:27:52] you hallelujah
[1:27:55] sister amy would you come amen
[1:27:58] i'll just stop right there saints but
[1:28:01] you look at this
[1:28:02] how beautiful this is we're that
[1:28:04] generation
[1:28:06] we're that generation that has been
[1:28:09] blessed
[1:28:10] to have the word of god open and
[1:28:14] my heart breaks when i run into people
[1:28:16] that still
[1:28:18] in this day and age as much word has
[1:28:20] been preached
[1:28:21] still feel like the bible
[1:28:25] but even more so the messages a book of
[1:28:28] do's and don'ts
[1:28:32] you know that reason that it's dues and
[1:28:34] don't saints is
[1:28:36] because they haven't got it off the page
[1:28:40] yet and got it
[1:28:42] written on the heart but when they get
[1:28:45] it off the page and they
[1:28:47] finally get it written on the heart and
[1:28:50] no longer be do's and don'ts
[1:28:52] it actually and we could extend this out
[1:28:54] tonight and finish out my thought but
[1:28:55] i'll just try and encapsulate it
[1:28:57] we can actually look at the do's and the
[1:28:59] don'ts but
[1:29:01] it suddenly becomes more of the ones
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] i want closer to him i want to live a
[1:29:11] life that expresses his life i
[1:29:14] i want to be one that he says well done
[1:29:17] my good and faithful servants
[1:29:19] it's not about a do or a don't it's
[1:29:21] about something inside of us stirring us
[1:29:25] i want i want to love you lord
[1:29:28] i want to praise you i want to serve you
[1:29:31] all the days of my life
[1:29:32] i want to be found faithful in that day
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:36] i want to hear i will hear those words
[1:29:39] well done
[1:29:40] my good and faithful servant because you
[1:29:43] see you were chosen
[1:29:46] for that position isn't that beautiful
[1:29:49] god didn't just cycle it through you
[1:29:51] know
[1:29:52] reminded me a friend of mine
[1:29:56] years ago almost had me convinced to
[1:29:58] join the military
[1:30:00] i mean we're talking cat whisker close
[1:30:02] joining the military
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:09] they promised him half of the moon said
[1:30:12] he could
[1:30:12] work his way up to the other half of the
[1:30:14] moon
[1:30:16] but when he actually got in the military
[1:30:18] they pretty much went
[1:30:20] okay the first 50 of you go that way
[1:30:22] next 50 of you go that one next 50 go
[1:30:24] that way
[1:30:26] and then when they got there they said
[1:30:27] this is what you'll be
[1:30:29] grunt see all their promises didn't
[1:30:32] matter
[1:30:34] none of that made any difference
[1:30:39] but if you could catch my thought
[1:30:41] tonight as i close
[1:30:44] god said first 50 goes this way
[1:30:48] no ain't ever you come right down in the
[1:30:50] midst of all humanity
[1:30:52] and said i choose you and i choose you
[1:30:56] and i choose you none of this first 50
[1:30:59] christians here first 50 christians
[1:31:01] there
[1:31:02] he went right down he was so selective
[1:31:06] and not only that he verified it and
[1:31:08] that's why the devil hates you so bad
[1:31:11] it's because he wrote your name in the
[1:31:12] book and that become the
[1:31:15] anchor of satan's animosity
[1:31:19] toward you because he says man i i've
[1:31:22] got to be able to defeat him the book
[1:31:24] says i can't and i won't but i've
[1:31:26] got to
[1:31:31] but what is it when god called us before
[1:31:35] the foundation the world
[1:31:37] he already had the light and at the day
[1:31:41] chosen he just turns it on
[1:31:43] and here we are serving the lord today
[1:31:47] loving the lord today desiring
[1:31:50] oh hallelujah all saints i got to stop i
[1:31:53] got i got more to give you
[1:31:55] amen but we're not on buffet night so

[1:32:11] this upon you
[1:32:12] i want you to go home and before you go

[1:34:11] that's all that matters it's not about
