our daily lives and father in every struggle every difficulty we just say thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus amen just want to say it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen uh just thankful for what God is is doing for us amen good to see you again Doug amen God bless you and uh family yes awesome God bless you too and then there's this young couple down here that are very special to me God bless you brother Bob sister Sue and I would say some other names of family but I'm sure I'll get it wrong and put my foot in the mouth so all I'll say is God bless you and we're happy to see you here today sister April we almost were putting you on Stranger status amen oh my how life can keep us so busy circumstances come amen you know I just want to lift up to you uh we didn't mention Our Sister Sarah just to remember her this morning I don't think we did but uh remember our sister Sarah this morning and also brother Adrien and sister aah there in Montana and uh Wayne and brother Wayne and his family also to remember them it just been having a you might say a little uh um oh I don't even know how to describe it you know a little sentimental moment you know Saints I just look around around us in the in the world we're living in and you know Satan would like to drive a wedge uh he just loves wedges you know if you've ever done much logging or doing you know wedge is a logger's friend and the wedge is the devil's friend and uh you know I just like to Institute almost like a little something not make it some kind of tradition but I would like for us to just uh remember the churches around us last week we prayed for uh Brother Rich in the church there in Monmouth and I would like us to just maybe start as a church just uh you know picking those churches around us and praying for them uh because you see this is this is not just a a solitary we're we're not just the only soldier on the field we're not the only group trying to serve the Lord and let our light shine in the community they're all around us and so as we would go this morning and and um at the reading of the word we'll just close and I would like us to just remember uh I always mess up their name brother John Andes and uh what's the name of their church end time message Tabernacle this will have nothing to do now don't misunderstand what I'm fixing to say but this will have nothing to do with doctrines or this or that I say we remember the body of Believers amen cuz the devil would like to drive the wedge in there where we'd think now you know this in the context of Brother John doesn't apply but the devil would like us to think there's there's some reason we shouldn't but I say because we are believers of the word of God that we should amen that should be elevated and lifted up to remember and as we would look around this morning we should remember each and every one here in this body of Believers whether present this morning or not of the circumstances that are not I don't see sister Dorcas uh this morning but we would just want to remember each and every one I tell you there's nothing like feeling discouraged feeling like you have been beaten down and then something just starts keeping you something just gets a Hal of you and you realize you know what I I I'm I felt discouraged now I feel encouraged and then come to church and have somebody sayou know brother Paul I don't know what you were doing but you know about 2:00 on Friday I just felt led to pray for you and you think back it was 2:00 you think prayers don't matter I'm here to tell you prayers matter amen hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles this morning God bless you and enjoy the song Service First Peter the 2 chapter: 19- 25 I want to speak to you this morning on the overall thought uh we spoke last Sunday on stepping out uh I want to speak today um on following in his steps and we'll just take this thought from the scripture amen you know we were you know in life personality wise God placed certain gifts uh just born in us you know um I I don't want to get too carried away in this but you know you can just look and pick the firstborn in a family often times and then you can pick the middle child and then of course God always Saves The Best For Last so the younger children come along the last amen oh I shouldn't have I shouldn't have ped that I'm sorry um anyway you can usually pick the younger child because they're just setting their weight waiting for someone to wait on them and uh so you know uh it it's just the truth we have to face the truth but you see as we we look at this we realize that God positionally placing us it should actually now come on catch this us being positionally placed by Christ amen yes we should be able to recognize the gift and the placing in our life right and of course being Sons and Daughters of God doesn't give us oldest child middle child youngest child but just one last supporting scripture amen the last shall be first and um the 11th Hour also receives the same pay amen so you look at that and these things are scriptural let's not argue over that but I want you to just look at First Peter the 2 chapter and listen let's just catch this for this is thankworthy if a man for conscious um boy speaking of youngest children they can't see either if a man for conscious toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you have uh when you be buffeted for your faults you take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is ex acceptable with God for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again now we often preach Saints just real I want to insert this we often preach that we need to die to our ourselves you realize how far we have to die yeah when we can come to the place that when you've been despitefully used when you've been reviled that you revile not back amen I hate to admit this because I'm the preacher this morning but I've got a ways to go amen I'm sorry to say it amen but sometimes when you're criticized you immediately start dredging facts on the other but you but you how can you speak to me like that I know about you but how about when we just say thank the Lord praise God hallelujah I've been saved by grace amen he's my judg amen and he says I've already been washed white by his blood Hallelujah there's where we need to look Hallelujah when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by those stripes ye were healed for ye were as sheep going astray that's it but are now returned into the shepherd and Bishop of your souls amen that just stirs my heart not out there still not identified out there but as having returned back to our correct Place amen with our Shepherd amen heavenly father that's right Lord we just want to lift the church there in Bellingham our brother John Andy father Lord just ask you to Father just just strengthen them as a body of Believers Lord may your grace and mercy give wisdom to them Father may you move in their midst in a supernatural way father that Lord they can be a lighthouse in their Community father and that the lives that would be touched by the preaching of the word father will not be touched for just a moment but be touched for eternity we ask a blessing upon them Father upon their Ministries Lord upon the musicians upon the Saints and the body of Believers father we just send out this Word of Faith Lord bound together with these Saints Lord that you would bless them in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord we ask you to bless the word in this assembly today father as we listen Lord and dig into the word of God may it have an eternal effect on us today we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen hallelujah you may be seated Saints I'm trying to break my habit of being being so personal with the church but I I find it very difficult because it is kind of just the way I am but um I'm going to preach to some of these imaginary people that you cannot see this morning amen they're here but you can't see them amen and so it is my brother and sister that often times you know uh we make mistakes Can someone say amen and uh we we do wrong and we make mistakes and uh we'll take the word workplace you know if you make too many mistakes you know they tend to uh start to give you less important uh obligations to take care of positions to do and you know just talking to a a brother uh recently that uh in their business they go uh through a lot of money he he shared with me that a very high volume of money very small margins and and he was talking about how there was an individual that they were going to have to dismiss from their company because he kept making mistakes and it was costing the company uh tremendous amounts of money and so you know we make mistakes we suffer for it we we have to deal with that there's criticism that comes with that and you know it might be man you know that wants to remind you it might be your wife or it might be your husband it might be your parents but it's there sometimes this criticism is good sometimes this criticism coming from Satan is this there to try to beat you down to try to keep you from the very promise that God has promised you maybe a promise that you knew at one time in life but but Satan has been beating on you and you kind of have lost sight of that because of this criticism but as you look at this my brother and sister uh uh Satan certainly feels Justified to point out your mistakes uh you know he he's got his Punch coming and he's he's pointing this out to you now my brother and sister sometimes these things have already been placed under the blood of Jesus Christ there they're not things that you you should actually be worrying about they're not things that you should uh let Satan Buffet you over because it's under the blood and when we put it under the blood let's not do a half-hearted effort let's get it completely under the blood amen let's get it to the place that we can stand with clear heart and conscience before God knowing that we have put it where it belongs but Satan he doesn't listen he doesn't pay attention he doesn't even care your opinion means nothing to him in fact my brother and sister while he knows that the word of God has dominion over him as long as we don't apply the word Satan's not going to apply it amen if we'll sit back and say well I think or I hope uh uh you know that uh it will be well my brother and sister the devil's not going to worry about it because if you are sitting there only with a half-hearted grip uh on that you know it it um it it just is not going to make any difference amen but you look at this now this constant reminder even when we have placed it under the blood of Jesus Christ Satan is there to Buffet you try to remind you try to get you to claim it once again and now you know this is why we often times talk about how that you should bring things using the altar here as an example take things in your life lay them on the altar get up and walk away now the reason that you need a clean bread is because Satan will do his best God bless you I didn't see you there sir uh Satan would like to get you to kind of hold on to those things I've laid them on the altar but and as it is if Satan can convince us to get back to the Altar and take a holds of those things again in other words condemnation comes in that you never feel like you had a release from it you you always feel like that somehow and and I I have as a pastor uh being able to travel different places in the world and deal with different age groups my brother and sister it's kind of amazing to me maybe you'll see a young person who's still struggling with things that they have done in their life and you understand they're young and you might say in a degree immature but when we have uh people that would maybe be considered established uh uh they are a little bit when I say aged I'm not talking about old but they've been around the gospel for a while and they're still being buffeted by the past they've never made that clean break you know it kind of tells you that in a way they didn't believe that they actually let go of it so maybe in an emotional realm they're still holding on to something from their past and it's a there something that they struggle against and I believe all of us can identify with that amen I certainly can identify with that but you know if we'll make the clean break get it completely under the blood amen and trust God right he said you you put it under the blood it's washed so clean I don't even remember it oh how precious is that that he doesn't even remember it amen so why would we remember something God decided wasn't worth remembering the devil is why we remember that's right yes sir just the devil and maybe a mean neighbor but maybe the mean neighbor is just anointed by the devil but I wouldn't put that in a context right when you don't want to go running around a neighbor that's uh you know fussing with you over your trash can doesn't necessarily mean he's got a devil on him so you know you look at this but it's there the devil feels Justified to bring a constant reminder of History a constant reminder to bring these things up but I want you to take this here we don't want to dwell on that too long but you see my brother and sister sometimes as the word says here we do good good see how now the role has been completely changed we do good and yet we feel punished for doing good and in that let me back up just a hair you see when we suffer having done wrong God you might say now pardon me I'm just using Paul words today God might have pity on you but you brought on yourself but when you do good and you suffer for it that's where Satan really gets in that's when he gets in there and says oh no one cares of what I have done that I did it for the Lord that I wanted to do and you know I'm just going to be real blunt I hope I don't hurt anybody's feelings today but you know sometimes the offices of the church is where uh the devil really comes in you know we might be the janitor and uh feel very unappreciated we might be a trustee feel very unappreciated a deacon feel very unappreciated be a song leader piano player musician feel very unappreciated and maybe somebody comes along speaking of musicians you know and they just have to I'm so glad I'm toned deaf I'm so glad because they got a really blunder before brother Paul figures out the musicians blunder I mean you know almost like the [Music] hey I I think something's wrong here but you see every office and right up to the ministry we can be doing good and there'll be something that will come because Satan wants you to use or lose I mean the Victory and the joy you had in your faithful service to God Amen serve God for 10 15 20 30 years and then suddenly you might be I got to be careful when I word it this way but you know we become a little more aged to the point that the young people look older and it's there that we would come and all of a sudden there's a big bump in the road and then all of a sudden the devil's like well that's because and if we'll listen to the devil he can literally steal our joy from us when we are doing our very best to serve God he doesn't care what our position is he's here to steal kill and Destroy but we my brother and sister you know just uh studying just reading this is the reason that we must get ourselves in a position and get sealed with the Holy Ghost amen cuz that is your only hope amen Ezekiel is that I think Ezekiel 4 or 6 six and and it's there he tells them go don't bring death or judgment on the city until you've gone through the city and sealed all of those my my brother and sister then once they are sealed judgment can come and I say today that's why we should just stop and say Lord what I need today is not some profound Revelation to quote scripture quote quotes uh to be of this or to be of that but Lord what I need is sealed because when I'm sealed the Judgment that's coming will not be judging me I can stand with confidence and the devil will try to erode that confidence but let's just go back to the word amen and the word said amen that's all you got to answer it worked for our lord Jesus we don't have to defend and come up with all kinds of things quote all kinds of quotes and scriptures we need to just go back the word says amen and I'm sealed and the word says that being sealed I'm be on the Judgment that is coming that's what I desire that's what I long for Hallelujah so we'll look at this you know sometimes in doing good amen we get buffeted but when we do well and suffer for it and you take it patiently oh now listen to me Saints I'm not being critical this morning but it's hard to take it patiently when you know you've done your best and your best lines with the word and then you're still criticized it's hard to take it patient can anybody tell tell me that's the truth amen amen amen amen amen for those of you who didn't say anything so you look at this my brother and sister there's when great Trials come when you know that you have done your best you're lined up with the word of God you're not looking at this as though I'm just going to check the boxes and therefore everything's well but you know and you can from the heart say all is well all is well I've got a prayer life I'm reading the word God is answering my prayer I'm seeing it in the word and and he's changing me Can someone say thank you Lord for changing me oh what a thing my brother and sister don't want to be 40 years reminds me of a man I knew in my childhood wonderful man good character but you know even as a kid I often wondered you know uh what is what is uh this man getting out of church because literally the song service would be over they would read scripture they would be seated and he leaned against the wall and slept through the whole service and I'm not judging him we understand now things like sleep apnea and different things like that he was a very hardworking man but you see my brother and sister just being in the house of God is more than attendance that's right amen there's got to be a outpouring of the word but there has to be more than just an outpouring of the word because we can read the word and say we've got the word but there has to be an outpouring of the spirit and the only way that there can be an outpouring of a spirit in that second to last song brother Isaac sang there I was just thinking yes this is a time for us to lift our hands and say Lord here I want you to stop stop by right here Lord I want you to fill me right here Lord I I don't want you to just sweep over the church Lord I need you to stop right here that's right and when you stop right here I will be changed because I've got that Universal surrender amen and so as we look at this I don't know why I would bring this up but maybe it's relevant only to me but God's going to keep trying our patience till we can fulfill this scripture right here that these things happening around us that we can take it patiently that we can stop now patiently my brother and sisters not the cop out well whatever the Lord wants will just happen and I don't have to be a contributor right no no no go through your Bible you'll find there's a lot of places if you to put it in context of our Modern English a lot of places say action required here right almost like when you go to the attorney right you go to the taxman they put these little things that says sign here well how about one that says action required here you would go through the Bible if you took your Bible you would be filling your Bible full of those little Post-it pointy arrows saying action required here action required here action required here amen there's an action required from you and me but it's nothing you've done that's right it's all what he's done amen amen amen sometimes the Holy Spirit just wants us maybe to lift a hand and amen say come by here Lord come by here cuz remember he's a gentleman amen yes exactly right you never seen a man or a woman that won the lottery where they had to drag him up there to get the check and that is so temporal that is so earthy statistically speaking in 7 to 12 years they'll be bankrupt and their life will be worse than it was when they won that's right and I'm not saying this judgmentally I'm saying to make a point but in church we almost have to beg that's exactly right come and get something greater than you've ever had in your life yeah please come yes you never see a lottery winner like that no sir they're up there they're so happy to have that even though the majority of them will turn into drugs alcohol and whatever and their life messed up am Satan's so clever isn't he I say Satan is very clever and that's why the scripture tells us to actually have respect for him sometimes you hear people say I'm just going to stomp on that devil well you better make sure you got him on the ground first that's right amen you might be talking about all the Stomping you want to talk about if you ain't got him under your feet first don't go boasting about The Stomping amen so take the word amen by the word conquer amen amen so as we look at this we realize that you know in this case or this example of the scripture when we do good and there is criticisms and struggles that come with it and we take that patiently without reviling that this is acceptable with God and in our human thinking we would want to turn that around almost you know and and and be justified but you know my brother and sister it is as we come down through the scripture here uh I I I have to own up you know in in our world and I hope you don't mind a natural example uh you know there's times that we make decisions out on the farm and uh you know six months later you look back and say why in the world did we do that you you can't even justify that you can't even in your own mind explain to yourself why you did that but the thing is you're better off to own it don't try and blame it my brother and I sometimes joke the reason we have Partners I have him he has me is we have somebody to blame it on yeah but you see my brother and sister you can't do that you need to own it so you know what I'm going to own when I do things right and there's criticisms when I do things according to the word of God and other people uh uh don't agree other people view it as some kind of uh you know Calamity that you did justifying for your own benefit or this that and the other my brother and sister just to learn to sit down and patiently say Lord I prayed about that now not some half-hearted prayer we have a joke around our house you know the joke about where the the young Minister he went to a big conference and um you know when he was at the conference he got up and he spoke and he comes home from this and he's telling his wife I I I preached you know there was just thousands of people there it was so wonderful I preached and and then I had a meeting with all of the council afterwards and they as offered me the pastorial ship of that church and the wife said what are you going to do and he said well I'm going to pray while you pack that's not real prayer no that's amen you're sitting at the car dealer with an ink pin in your hand and just before the ink pen hits the page Lord should I buy this car or not your only hope is is that the paper tears and the pen won't right you should have that settled before you ever went to the car lot there's a lot of things we ought to have settled before we ever take the first step into it so we can't say well I did and I feel as though there's a tremendous no you didn't do your diligence we're called to do diligence amen hallelujah so you look at this we do good we do the right things and you suffer for it sometimes man will be the one that tries to rub it in sometimes it's the devil amen but the Lord will allow these things to take place because he's molding our character that we'll come to the place that we want to be acceptable of God more than anything else this is not now I hope I'm not too blunt today we have some company forgive me but I don't really care what you think I care what he thinks that's right amen amen what happens in the criticisms that come with this I want him to say Well done my good and faithful servant you might not ever say Well done Paul but if he says well done all is well amen so that's the steps that we have to take is to not look around for public opinion that's right my brother and sister when we get into the realm of public opinion we have to start almost then having a little bit of a a discussion and the discussion comes and you know I find this interesting I hope this is not too personal but discussions can be influenced by who gives the most money to the church they're worth two votes and their wife is worth two votes and their children are worth two votes so the rest of you might as well stay home what do you end up with a political church that's right not a gospel church a political church that's why the gospel says keep all of that trash out of here right amen keep all of that outside the doors outside the walls of the assembly let it only be God's voice that gives Direction on the inside amen and that's why we pray about these things that's why we stand solidly before the Lord Lord what do you want me to do that's right amen amen now you know when we look at this my brother and sister when it comes to the things that uh we take patiently to find it acceptable of God when it doesn't all go well yeah you've prayed you've followed the word still get criticized I think we're Justified aren't we start a little reverse political campaign it's not my fault it's their fault what did our lord Jesus answer that equation with Lord forgive them they know not what they do amen oh help us to apply that hallelujah amen I I'm going to just use Brother David sister Dian sister Ruth for an example real quick maybe they clean the church but they forget the garbage can in The Minister's office is this some kind of subliminal message no sir sir no sir and if you readily hold to Lord forgive them they know not what they did with the trash can I use that as a light-hearted example right because some might get serious quick right stepping off the ledge into the deep end of the pool but you see my brother and sister if we start to embrace that approach where does Satan get his foot in the door that's right he can't get his foot in the door because no matter what happens we're standing there saying Lord if it was an accident it's an accident if it was intented but Lord forgive them anyhow regardless of what was what forgive them anyhow Lord and if we'll step into that realm people can insult you degrade you cut you down to your back or to your face and all you'll be doing is saying Lord I'm just going to accept this I'm going to take it and forgive them Lord now they may never ever be blessed by that but you will be that's right absolutely you'll walk with a liberty in Jesus Christ like you never walked in your life and I'm going to go off into a deep end of a pool maybe this goes about 25 30 40 years my brother and sister of maybe it was a preacher even insulted you or spoke ill of you or did all of those things and it left a mark upon you I've got some of those marks in my own life and have been Slowly by the grace of God rooting them out because I will not be hindered by those things that happened back there because I want to live in the present right now the spirit's moving he's here this morning and I want to walk in that not looking backwards oh I would if no forget the ifs I'm living right here in the presence of the king yes and the Devil he's over there doing double time digging up the bones the dead body he's trying to dig it up keep you from doing what do we do Lord forgive them anyhow forgive them anyhow Lord I'm just going to patiently wait father you'll do the work you'll touch the lives cuz I'll tell you the lives you think you can touch will be the lives that you muddy that's right exactly right yeah so you know I need to hurry along here oh just so you know the song service was 11 minutes longer so when you guys start counting time I've still got 11 more minutes sorry about that brother Isaac just say it just saying so verse 21 tells us for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered and let's move the O and make it personally suffered for you amen CU whenever you have two people in the car you can always keep throwing the blame to the one beside you so let's take it from the US not changing scripture but he died for you amen just keep that as a central part of your mind you got nowhere to toss it he died for me he was on the cross because of Paul he was on the cross and suffered everything that he suffered to take my sin so that I can stand here today before you and say in Jesus Christ I am righteous amen without that I'd be a hypocrite to say those words but he took it that's right and if he takes it it's taken it's settled it's finished it's done it's out of man's remembrance it's finished hallelujah amen amen now look we all know the little poem on the footprints on the sand of time my brother and sister it's one thing as that little poem lays out it's one thing to follow his footsteps but I can tell you every one of us has a stage in our life where we weren't following footsteps we were being carried that's right amen and it is isn't two toes being drugg in the sand where he's got a hold of your hair or your hand dragging you along he picked us up he carried us he took us to the Finish amen and Satan wants us to forget that sir and he wants us to turn religion into just like an event like the Kanas and if anybody's a kanana I don't mean to say bad on that amen but uh you know uh it's it's you know just something we do yeah it I don't know if it's the quanas or not it's one of those Elks one of some deal like that I remember reading that you're only required to come to one meeting a year some people got confused and thought that was their Church my brother and sister you know little arrow action required here yes amen are we doing okay okay so we we're supposed to follow in his steps now as you look at this we we'll see my brother and sister that sometimes uh as we we look at what our lord Jesus has done for us I think we fail to catch the real moving of the spirit the real revelation of what it is yes sir because without the action on his part you say brother Paul this is so simplistic but uh the scripture does say we're supposed to be as ministers stir up your pure minds and that also includes Simplicity yes sir because if it wasn't there some of us with our IQ marked on the post where it's at would not be making it I don't say that as any understatement see it's just if it had to come to Pure intelligence there'd be just a lot of people wouldn't make it but I'm going to turn that around he said it come down to Faith pure faith and unfortunately some are not going to make it that's right right because to them it's got to be deeper than that that's right it's got to be more intellectualized and that's fine you know our brother Mark down in Arizona wrote that book and and uh I made it about halfway through and I I was just like I I I just gave up on it words were so big I was reading it one hand in a dictionary and one hand in his book and and you know I just thought I'm a failure but I just can't deal with this any longer I I understand the point he's making he wrote this for people whose IQ is double digit uh and uh you know uh I'm I'm just going on and one day I was talking now this is going to sound sound a little snarky of me but I was talking with another Minister another Pastor in the message and that book got brought up and I said I only made it half through and he said I made it through the first chapter and I felt better about myself should I probably not because I'm just a sinner saved by grace but we're human so you look at this as we follow he didn't do any sin he took s amen he was reviled and he suffered he was threatened but he did not retaliate my i' we've got a lofty goal to reach to Saints a very lofty Ro goal to reach to amen and so is there that this scripture also declared that by his stripes it's right here by his stripes were healed and I find it interesting then in us doing good and being revived us being uh doing good and and uh you know under this influence of of uh being reviled to retaliate and do do all this and then right in there's healing they must have when they edited this somehow got it on the wrong page you know why a lot of people don't have their healing because they have underlying currents of spirits that are going out here they believe they believe in healing they pray for healing but they have anger or bitterness or disappointment that takes them to the edge of bitterness and they don't relate the two this is why healing shows up right here in this chapter because we have to come to the place there is no reaction state of North Carolina there's a deacon in a church there as close as we get to description pretty good sized brother come out of a rough life as a Young Man married lovely family asked to be a deacon in the church one night a man comes angry that his wife is attending that church now the man gets physical I guess you'd say violent strikes this brother in the face and the brother said about the time my fist was about an inch from his face it stopped then he realized I'm not the answer that's right he is that's right and he got on his knees right there in the fo La of their church and repented crying out with bitter tears Lord that's not who I am that's the Lord amen amen I'm a Son of God Amen and he said the Lord right there took that from him never ever again people push him insult him call him names and he said by that time God's work I could just stand there and take it yeah threaten any of the Lambs and sheep in the assembly I'll be the lion of Judah threaten my pastor I'll be the lion of Judah strike me in the face for what I believe and you'll find me standing there unmovable Lord help us that's right Lord help us remember Jesus was injured in the house of his friends that's right and so sometimes we have to just recognize that so you know he be bore our sins in his body on a tree and uh that we being dead to sin should live by righteousness whose Stripes you were healed for we were as sheep going astray but are now returned into the shepherd and Bishop of our souls I tell you what I want to do I want to come to a church that has that kind of atmosphere I want to come into the house of God and experience that kind of atmosphere not just in you or you but I want it in me amen I want to have that kind of atmosphere as a control center of my life amen atmosphere of grace and mercy it's much easier to judge though judging can be an instantaneous response sometimes Mercy requires us to stop and say Lord thy will be done amen but I want to go to a church that's not only just a atmosphere like that but I want to go to a a church has got an atmosphere of strength amen you see pacifists many religions are built around being pacifist they're not going to strike anybody but they don't have spiritual strength that's right amen they don't have spiritual courage that's it they don't have Revelation that's right so it takes more than just being pacif that's right we need to be able to stand boldly that's right scripture talks about standing boldly amen amen I'm not talking about standing on the corner at the intersection with a sign that's not bold my brother and sister in fact many of those people are deterrence to people accepting the gospel amen but if we could step into a position of strength and courage and optimism is optimism a word that's active in our church are we the one when people go well where do you go to church well we go down that little Brick Church on Midland it's not much there's only just a few of us we we know we're just if you don't come you haven't missed anything well I'm sure people are going to just jump up and down I want to go to that church I want to have that kind of enthusiasm for the gospel what do you have for blankets and pillows no sir yeah that's right problem about the coffee Brother David is well we W to go there pretty soon the church would be empty unless you all like apple fritters because that's the only thing we would serve look my brother and sister there ought to be an optimism I'm not boasting but I want to just give you an example I'm in Home Depot the other day looking to buy a little short step stool ladder you know the ones that one-sided Three Little Steps got the top folds up flat goes and and and we're they're looking at them and we're trying them out we're climbing up on them this one's not very sturdy now you might think that looks foolish but I I'm a tight wad now and the older I get the tighter it gets and I I'm just like I'm not buying some little rickety piece of stuff I'm going to test these out TOP Step yeah no put it back pretty soon I see this nice gray-haired friendly very friendly looking man over there and I thought I look silly he climbs all the way up on top and sits down on the little top Arch on that thing and then he's like Oh Brother David you're going to love this then he's sitting on top of that Arch and I thought man this guy's strange is it okay to H be happy in the house of God Amen so this man's sitting there and I looked over at him and I said sir is that ladder sturdy and I was like sturdier than that one and I was like what you going to do with that ladder I'm going down to Pyramid Lake the water's 5T deep for 100 yards out there and I'm going to go all the way out there to where the water gets deep and I'm going to put little cross legs on this thing and I'm going to put it down there then I'm I'm going to climb up on top of this ladder and lean against that little bar and I'm going to fly fish for 20 lb trout I'm in and we got to talk and he starts to share how that he's going to meet his brother-in-law sister-in-law and their daughter has a brain tumor doctors don't expect her to live very long and we're going to have this family reunion we're going to go go down there we all love to fish and we're going to go down there and spend this time together cuz it might be her last I couldn't help myself he said well the go Lord's in control boom door flew open you said the right words sir I stood there the wife often wonders he went to town never came home I don't know why I'm standing there in Home Depot and I'm witnessing to this man God's A Healer God's A Healer God's A Healer God's A Healer God's A Healer and this man when he got done he was a Christian and we talked and got into that and he goes thank you so much I'm going to go home and share this with my family it's going to encourage their faith and I said sir the word is the word and we speak the word it opens it up gives authority to it and he said I believe that and we practically hug there people walking in Home Depot like what is this happening here these strange people people walking by us we're talking about and the Lord moves and the Holy Spirit drops in and God honors his word and people are walking by oh my but I didn't care amen I didn't care this is my God I'm talking about and this is a life my brother and sister that God can move upon and change and give healing and give the word to amen so we come to a place that it comes time we have to step out amen we got to step out amen we can't just sit back and say well we're message Believers and we're Bible Believers and and and if God wants them to come to church and and get healed or get saved or get back to serving him if God wants it to happen we'll just wait till they show up well I want to be the one that stands in Home Depot or Walmart or in a doctor's office or in the mall or wherever is at and when the unction of the Lord Lord come I want a courage bold to stand and say if you want me to speak Lord open the door and then have a man say you know what we believe in healing boom I hear the door slam open amen let's be that kind of believer let's create that kind of atmosphere let's bring that kind of results that's guaranteed by the word no hindrances that's right you got to leave bitterness at the door you got to B leave frustration at the door you got to leave all of that history at the door this is a new day in the Lord this is a fresh time to serve God the past be the past and let us live here in the present and look to the future of the moving of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah my I'm already past time and I haven't even made it what might you call the first page Ephesians 6 amen we'll just jump right down I had more scripture there we jump down to verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God you realize how important that is Saints amen we can we can buckle on the helmet we can buckle on the shin guards but it might not do anything for you that might not be where the enemy strikes you you know he often times he like to go for the head if he can muddy up our thinking then he's muddied us up but I want you to think about it this way I don't want to skewer this help me Lord mostly our issues are issues of the heart yes sir yes sir that's exactly right Youth Camp youth con convention Belgium individual or Pastor backslid right get rid of the shepherd you get to scatter the Sheep it's obvious this had impacted this individual I said okay what from there my parents and one of my brothers and half of our church all backslid they're out in the world now if I killed over dead or you found out tomorrow I was a drunk in an alley in this city do not use that as an excuse that's exactly right don't say well a title wave tore down our house build another house amen build the house you got stronger build it in the right place the right atmosphere and this little girl she's grieving she's grieving but God's right on time amen hallelujah God's right on the time you know what my brother and sister you see you can't say you trust if you don't that's it and you can't take the words of trust and turn them into real trust trust has the little arrow action required that's right and when we really trust everything can shake down around us yes sir and we can stand and say God's got something better better God's got something better for me amen so now we look my brother and sister so we're not wrestling against flesh and blood very familiar scripture right we're we're dealing with darkness of this world so we take this armor and we're able then when we stand but we need to have our loins GED about with truth that's right amen if you take and my point I'm going to get to I'll just cut right to it if you take any one of these out of here it's not going to work you can have righteousness of the flesh without truth it won't work that's it and you can have truth without righteousness it won't work amen and if you don't have I hope you don't mind me being redundant here if you don't have your feet shawed with some preparation that doesn't say persperation that's right preparation what does that mean you've done something already that's it you've got your yourself ready for walking you've got yourself ready to go to battle you've got yourself ready to run into the presence of God whatever is presented to you you're ready amen amen Above All you have to have some Faith right cuz you see without faith you can't quench anything that's right amen amen takes faith that's right and when Faith starts to rise up in you you say but brother Paul I have a besetting sin well I tell you what you do with that besetting sin you get to the place when you recognize the symptom and the signal right I hope you know what I'm talking about it's true you recognize the S the signal that's sent out often times you want to you want to know what it is real cut and dry disappointment discouragement a little dose of of of um oh I don't know how do I want to say this I want to say it correctly you don't know what to say don't say it that's good amen can I say it none of us have it right because we're Christians but you just throw a little dose of depression in there God doesn't care any how nobody at church loves me my parents don't love me my children don't love me well pick anyone you want we don't have time enough to go through every alternative but you see what happens then see there where the fiery Dart comes the devil doesn't shoot you in the foot if it doesn't bother you he doesn't shoot you in the mind if it doesn't bother you but sometimes something right in the heart tears us up quench it that's it come on quench it that's it need a little faith amen Faith isn't just to take a Rapture with my brother and sister it's not just for healing it also quenches fiery darts amen faith will do that Hallelujah now as we look I I got to hurry on here you got to have the helmet on see every one of these is required you need the spirit you need the word amen praying prayer and supplication in the spirit yes sir amen now this just requires a comment or two I'm guiltier than guilty but my brother and sister if you pray like you talk to the operator on the phone Lord can you give me the address of Walmart on 12th Avenue what do you expect to get would y'all forgive me if I'm wrong that's one of the spots Satan has robbed us almost more than anywhere else our prayer life yes sir sounds like H I won't even go there you know what I'm talking about our prayer life sound like something that come back from the dead you know look I need to hurry move on I haven't claimed my 12 minutes yet so I I think you get the point I can move on so so I hope this not too personal since how I think it applies to most of us when we run from our problems have any of you ever done that before you know the parking lot was supposed to be the playground for the kids but you see all these little dimpled looks and you know I didn't know what those were for years until we went to austral and I realized that's where people have been putting their head in the sand and it leaves that little dimple there we got to see the ostriches do that you know isin't it amazing you guys ever watched ostrich do that they scratch a hole they literally put their head down there and kick sand on it now they do it for other reasons than people think you know they get flies and lice and those kind of things and that's how they're dealing with it I don't know what your reason would be but if your head is down in that sand you can't you can't see anything so my brother and sister you got to come to the place that you run from your problem can anybody tell me what happens when you run from your problem plus you also just run right into another one so it don't matter which direction of the compass compass you you you run from a problem you just run right into another way now you got two and people come and say my life's a total shambles why because they never dealt with problems years ago amen maybe the Lord moved upon them to repent on something and they pushed back and they just carried that with them you know I've used that analogy before in the airport somebody going through there and they got about 25 or 30 suitcases hooked together and they're dragging them through the airport and you think what are they doing well I tell you what they're just taking their baggage with them man we're not supposed to take our baggage we're supposed to do away with these things get it under the blood amen hallelujah so if we would run into the promise of the word for our hour as often as we ran away from it imagine what our lives would be imagine how spiritual our lives would be if we ran into the promise instead of from it amen amen but you know we step out of our fears and we step into a promise and our life starts to change immediately and when we've stepped into faith I want to ask you what's going to stand in your way when it's no longer your emotion no longer your reasoning right no longer your excuse of what God didn't do for you 20 years ago if you just stand there and say God's word is God's word and I believe it that's it and I accept it today as word just as valid today as it ever was amen nothing will stand in your way nothing okay I need to hurry along if the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ proves he's here among us then press till you get to him amen amen right yeah that's exactly right believe he he's here in church today amen believe God's with us he's in our house he's in our life our car yes sir job whatever it is he proves he's here among us then press till you get to him like the little woman with the blood issue and all the different things that taken place and all the adversaries in her way she just pressed right on until she touched him now we know most of us wouldn't do that because our church clothes are too nice to crawl in the dirt and we're too respectable to push and shove and crawl between people's legs and keep going and we don't want a Hem of the Garment we want a handshake yeah how desperate are we that's it right I say we ought to be desperate enough as this quote says to do whatever it takes to get to Jesus Christ she pressed right on through till she touched him and if this church tonight I want to change that to today would do the same thing would press through every scale of unbelief would lock swords with the devil and his unbelief and press through to know that you're a child of God and an heir to these things and Jesus Christ standing present to show you that he's with you that's right first step right there you have to have confidence he's with you but brother Paul you don't know my life I don't care about your life it's under the blood yes sir that's it and he's standing present to show you that he's with you to keep his word be perseverant don't let nothing stand in your way can I say that out loud don't let nothing stand in your way amen you know I don't want to go into too much detail but by God's grace I have been in conversation just very blunt I think I'll just say it out loud a man left his wife and children got caught up in alcohol got caught up in drugs ended up in a homosexual relationship and couldn't even tell you how it happened that's the scary thing right it wasn't like well I felt attracted to this guy he said when I come to myself I felt just revolted but he would do drugs he would do alcohol find himself in another relationship this man's brother come to me and said brother Paul you will you have a conversation with my brother of course I would we had a conversation and he said I've made such a mess of my life I've made such a mess of my life I I I I've got away from that spirit that Spirit got broke and I'm no longer attracted to that and and I quit drinking and when I qu quit drinking and then all of the little peripheral not hardcore but peripheral drug stuff just all faded away but look at the wreck of my life well Paul being so spiritual I just well like let me give you some advice sir no sir when they were kind of looking the other way him and his brother I was like oh Lord what do I say to this man I was shaking my shoes and I'm not kidding I literally was sitting there so nervous my foot's bouncing up if Jerry had been there she'd have said there's something wrong with my husband he's having a meltdown I'm just sitting there oh I it's just an adrenaline rush Paul there's no Lions there's no Tigers there's no reason to have adrenaline this is fear and then something said tell him that's it if he will go and humble himself that's it before me that's it I will make the way before him amen right that's right I was like brother that's that boldness come I felt like a different man draw the sword brother you need to repent amen from the depths of your heart and he just slid out of his chair right there and started crying out to God and when he got done repenting I said God will take you back speak to your wife and say honey I still love you and I want to be married to you and I ask you forg me and his wife I wasn't there his wife got down in her knees wrapped her arms around him I have the same thing to confess to you amen and their children are growing up in the house of God about that big about now and they are happy what can wash that's it away my my sin nothing that's it nothing amen but the blood of Jesus brother Alex will you come amen what can make me white amen was wher that's it you see you got to see yourself that's it in that position that's it than washed white amen hallelujah and when I'm washed white he makes me whole it amen now that's not the way the song goes but that's how the program worked that's it amen amen that's right you got to be washed before you can be whole that's right
