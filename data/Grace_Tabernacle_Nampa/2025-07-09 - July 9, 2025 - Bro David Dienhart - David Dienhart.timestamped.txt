[7:52] Make it clear to me. Give me the word.
[8:00] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[8:03] the word.
[8:07] It's my total victory
[8:11] over every situation.
[8:15] Give me the word. One more time. Oh,
[8:18] give me the word.
[8:23] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[8:27] the word.
[8:30] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[8:34] the word.
[8:38] It's my total victory
[8:42] over every situation.
[8:45] Give me the word.
[8:49] Amen.
[8:52] Let's sing number 208 as brother David
[8:54] comes.
[8:57] And uh let's stand together for this
[8:59] one.
[9:03] For I was born
[9:08] to be
[9:12] a dwelling
[9:15] place,
[9:18] a home for the presence of the Lord.
[9:29] Let my life
[9:33] now be
[9:36] separated
[9:38] unto
[9:40] thee,
[9:42] that I might be
[9:45] what I was born
[9:49] to be.
[9:53] For I was born
[9:58] to be
[10:01] a dwelling
[10:04] place,
[10:07] a home for the presence
[10:12] of the Lord.
[10:17] Let my life
[10:21] now be
[10:24] separated
[10:26] unto thee,
[10:29] that I might be
[10:32] what I was born
[10:36] to be. Let my life now be.
[10:40] Oh, let my life
[10:45] now be.
[10:48] separated
[10:50] unto thee
[10:53] that I might be.
[10:59] Bless you. Thank you. Good word like the
[11:02] songs.
[11:03] [Music]
[11:06] You believe that? You believe you were
[11:08] born to be a dwelling place?
[11:11] Amen. and let your life then be now
[11:13] separated
[11:15] unto him. Amen. For where is he today?
[11:22] You've received him. Where is he?
[11:26] You were born to be a dwelling place.
[11:28] Amen. If you're born again, that showed
[11:31] the seed of God was laying there.
[11:33] Nothing can come in and take that from
[11:35] you.
[11:36] Amen. Hallelujah.
[11:37] You've passed from death unto life. So
[11:39] let's let go and let God have his way.
[11:44] Amen.
[11:45] That's why we come short, isn't it?
[11:48] Yielding ourselves, letting go and
[11:50] letting God have his way instead of our
[11:52] friends have their way, our children
[11:54] have their way.
[11:56] Amen.
[11:58] Amen. All right. Amen. I was sure
[12:01] thankful for what's been these last two
[12:04] songs. In fact, the one give me the word
[12:07] I was going to sing at the end of the
[12:09] service. So, so that was that was
[12:12] certainly in this one and all of them,
[12:14] but these last two especially were right
[12:16] down the line. So, thank you. God bless
[12:19] you all. You can let us have a word of
[12:22] prayer and and thank you musicians and
[12:26] God bless you.
[12:30] Amen. Lord Jesus, as we humbly and
[12:33] reverently bow in your presence, we know
[12:37] that we are incapable
[12:39] of our own self as men, women, me as a
[12:43] servant, your minister to minister the
[12:45] food in due season to these people. I am
[12:47] incapable in myself to bring that to
[12:50] your children.
[12:52] My dependency, Lord, is not upon me. It
[12:55] is upon you to speak your will, speak
[12:58] your thoughts, speak your word. And
[13:02] Lord, your word then spoken cannot
[13:04] return to you void, but will accomplish
[13:06] what is sent to do. Lord, we're
[13:09] dependent upon you. We are not here by
[13:11] chance. We have not come here to be
[13:12] seen. In fact, a true Christian, a true
[13:15] believer, nothing happens to them by
[13:18] chance.
[13:19] It's been ordained. And so, Lord, may we
[13:22] realize that. May we come to ourselves
[13:25] and may you bring us to ourselves and
[13:28] Lord may we realize our place and our
[13:30] position our positive position.
[13:34] Lord in thee we pray and for your glory
[13:38] bless your word. Speak forth minister
[13:41] what you desire and Lord I am here to
[13:45] follow. You have your way. May man not
[13:48] be seen here in this service but may you
[13:50] be seen. May you be realized and may
[13:54] there be a fresh coming together
[13:57] face-to-face meeting with you. We pray
[14:00] and ask this in thy name the Lord Jesus
[14:03] Christ and for your glory. And we'll say
[14:06] as we leave here tonight, it was good to
[14:09] be in the house of the Lord because why?
[14:12] We met you.
[14:14] speak to our hearts personally, become
[14:17] personalized more than ever has been in
[14:20] individual lives tonight in Jesus' name
[14:23] we pray. And we believe that we now have
[14:26] and believe we receive what we asked for
[14:28] and we give you thanks for it because
[14:30] you said so. Amen.
[14:34] Amen. Amen. Turn with me in the book of
[14:36] Philippians. It's good to be in the
[14:38] house of God. I greet those online,
[14:40] those that and uh brother David, good to
[14:43] see you. God bless you. Amen.
[14:48] Praise the Lord. Some people can go
[14:51] regardless of ages. That's good.
[14:56] God give you strength, my brother. Amen.
[15:00] Well, we're not here by chance. We
[15:02] haven't met here by chance. This door is
[15:04] still open. I think we ought to we ought
[15:06] to just take advantage of it.
[15:09] Amen. You believe that?
[15:11] Amen.
[15:12] Amen. Let's forget about ourselves
[15:13] tonight.
[15:15] Amen. Amen. Because I'll tell you, it's
[15:18] not do any good to think about yourself
[15:20] and try to mix that with the word of
[15:22] God. It doesn't work.
[15:24] Amen. Just let God have his way over
[15:27] you. Okay. Philippians chapter 1
[15:33] and we'll begin reading here with the
[15:35] 19th verse.
[15:38] And Paul is is in prison writing this
[15:41] letter.
[15:42] He's he's uh he's been under bondage.
[15:47] But he says, "But for I know that this
[15:52] shall turn to my salvation through your
[15:55] prayer and the supply of the spirit of
[15:58] Jesus Christ." What about your trial?
[16:01] What about your test? What do you
[16:03] believe the outcome is
[16:06] in verse 20? According to my earnest
[16:09] expectation. What's your expectation?
[16:12] According to my earnest expectation and
[16:15] my hope. What's the hope? The promise.
[16:19] What's his what's he hoping in? He's
[16:21] expecting to see the word manifested.
[16:25] according to my earnest expectation and
[16:28] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[16:30] ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
[16:33] always, so now also Christ shall be
[16:37] magnified in my body, whether it be by
[16:41] life or by death.
[16:45] For me to live is Christ, and to die is
[16:50] gain.
[16:52] Amen. You may be seated. I'd like you to
[16:55] turn me to Colossians chapter 1
[16:58] to continue here. I want to take this
[17:01] title for me to live as Christ a Christ
[17:05] centered life.
[17:07] for me to live as Christ a Christ
[17:10] centered life.
[17:13] In Colossians chapter 1
[17:16] verse 27 verse 26
[17:24] let's just back up a little further.
[17:26] Let's start with verse 24. who now
[17:29] rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[17:32] fill up that which is behind of the
[17:34] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[17:38] his body's sake which is the church. You
[17:41] remember eternal life
[17:44] is living for others.
[17:47] Amen. Where are you identified? I trust
[17:50] that tonight you'll see where you're
[17:51] identified. Amen. Because God God has
[17:55] identified his bride. God is identifying
[17:58] his bride to be himself.
[18:02] I'll just be very blunt with you. That's
[18:03] exactly what this message is. Amen. It's
[18:08] the revealing of the son of man. It's
[18:10] the body word of the son of man. That's
[18:12] the message.
[18:14] Amen. All right. So
[18:18] he said in verse, "Wherefore I'm in my
[18:20] body's sake which is the church.
[18:23] Wherefore I am made a minister according
[18:25] to the dispensation of God. Which
[18:28] dispensation are you in?
[18:30] He said, according to the dispensation
[18:32] of God, which is given to me for you to
[18:36] fulfill the word of God, even the
[18:38] mystery, singular mystery, which God
[18:41] hath hid from ages and from generations,
[18:44] but now is made manifest to his saints.
[18:51] to whom, that's the saints, the saints,
[18:53] to whom God would make known what is the
[18:57] riches of the glory of this mystery
[19:01] among the Gentiles, which is Christ in
[19:05] you,
[19:07] the hope of glory. Now, we know that
[19:09] Christ is the word revealed. Christ is
[19:13] the mystery. This mystery
[19:16] revealed, the mystery of God revealed is
[19:19] Christ. Christ in you would be the
[19:22] mystery of God revealed.
[19:25] Let me say it again. Christ in you would
[19:28] be the mystery of God revealed.
[19:30] Amen.
[19:31] Or I should say Christ in you is
[19:34] the mystery of God revealed.
[19:36] All right. Now
[19:40] this word in verse 20 of Philippians
[19:43] boldness means a fearless confidence.
[19:48] plainly
[19:49] boldness. I said, "May I" He said, "Let
[19:52] me speak with boldness." Let me go back
[19:55] here. I shall be not ashamed or or
[19:58] ashamed means to be to be um embarrassed
[20:02] can be one word
[20:05] that the bold that with all boldness is
[20:07] always. So now Christ shall be magnified
[20:09] with all boldness. Fearless confidence
[20:12] plainly, openly, frankly is boldness. To
[20:16] magnify means to enlarge, make great and
[20:20] declare great in my body.
[20:24] Amen.
[20:26] So what's that going to take? It's going
[20:27] to compake a complete dependency on he
[20:30] that's in you.
[20:31] Right?
[20:32] It's a giving over of yourself.
[20:35] Amen. Amen. It's a giving over of
[20:38] yourself completely to him.
[20:41] Yielding to him. The more you yield to
[20:43] him, the more manifestation of himself
[20:45] you'll see.
[20:47] Right.
[20:48] Amen. That's right. God will work
[20:50] through you.
[20:53] Amen. So for even on verse 13 of
[20:57] Philippians 2:13 said, "It's for God
[21:00] which workketh in you both to will and
[21:02] to do of his good pleasure."
[21:05] Amen. Now all that God was, he poured
[21:09] into Christ. You've heard the brother
[21:10] Bram say that over and over again. He
[21:13] said all that God was. We seem to
[21:16] realize not realize he said all.
[21:18] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[21:22] Then Christ was the revelation of
[21:24] himself in flesh. He came in flesh to
[21:26] redeem you and I through the blood. And
[21:28] the blood being poured out made way for
[21:30] the Holy Ghost himself to come and live
[21:32] in you and I.
[21:34] Amen. You believe that?
[21:35] All right. Then all that God was, he
[21:38] poured into Christ. And all that Christ
[21:40] was, he poured into his body, his bride,
[21:46] which is his church.
[21:48] He poured into his bride,
[21:51] which is the true church. So it's was
[21:54] God above us, God with us.
[21:58] Now it's God in us, not another God. The
[22:02] God, the creator of heavens and earth,
[22:04] the author of life, the giver of every
[22:06] good gift, the perfect one who is
[22:08] perfect in all he all his ways is
[22:11] perfect.
[22:13] Amen.
[22:16] You cannot run is what the prophet said.
[22:19] You cannot run without having an
[22:21] absolute.
[22:22] Right.
[22:24] Now, we are to run. We're in a we're in
[22:26] a race. We're running to the finish. We
[22:28] see the goal is in the goal line. If
[22:30] you're not seeing the goal line, you
[22:32] need to really get into the word because
[22:34] the goal line is right here before us.
[22:37] Amen.
[22:38] And so we want to be able to see. See is
[22:41] to understand. Not not phys not figure
[22:44] it out,
[22:45] right?
[22:46] But allowing God to reveal. So run that
[22:48] you may obtain.
[22:51] Amen. So he said we cannot run. We
[22:54] cannot run life
[22:58] for to me to live as Christ. We that's
[23:01] Christ in you and I. We cannot run life
[23:03] without an absolute. And the definition
[23:05] of an absolute
[23:07] we need to not just kind of lightly go
[23:10] over these definitions. The definition
[23:12] of your absolute which is Christ is
[23:16] unlimited in its power.
[23:21] Perfect in itself. Yes.
[23:26] Hallelujah.
[23:28] Maybe ought to start preaching now.
[23:31] Unlimited in its power. Perfect in
[23:34] itself.
[23:35] Amen.
[23:38] And it really is an ultimate.
[23:43] Uultimate.
[23:45] Other words, the amen.
[23:49] That's it. That settles it.
[23:53] It's a place where you are tied to
[23:55] something. It's or as I can say, it's
[23:58] something you're tied to.
[24:02] The Christian church is passing through
[24:03] the deepest waters it's had for the last
[24:06] 2,000 years.
[24:08] The Christian life should be a stabled
[24:11] life.
[24:14] If something comes to upset that
[24:15] stability, God didn't upset it.
[24:20] No, the devil upset it
[24:23] and he got you over on his side probably
[24:25] through reasoning and feelings and
[24:28] senses
[24:30] because this person in you the new
[24:34] birth. Do you realize that Jesus Christ
[24:37] the new birth is revealed in you and I?
[24:40] Yeah. Amen.
[24:41] Who is this new birth? It's your
[24:44] ultimate.
[24:47] Who is what is this? Who is this new
[24:49] creation? It's your ultimate. It's your
[24:51] absolute.
[24:53] It's the the ultimate. It's the amen.
[24:57] I don't care how you feel or what you're
[24:59] going through. You have the amen.
[25:01] Amen.
[25:02] To every situation.
[25:04] Praise the Lord.
[25:05] The problem is is we're fearing the
[25:07] situation instead to the depending on
[25:09] our absolute.
[25:10] Right.
[25:11] That's right.
[25:12] All right. If but if we had put him
[25:14] first place over the situation, the
[25:17] situation is under control and you can
[25:18] let off the pressure.
[25:22] You can quit striving.
[25:25] Oh, but I still feel it. But your
[25:27] feelings aren't your absolute.
[25:28] Right.
[25:30] Your senses are not your absolute.
[25:34] You can feel different every day. You
[25:36] can you can and your you know your heart
[25:38] has actually two meanings in the
[25:40] scripture. Your heart can be your mind,
[25:42] which is your spirit, or your heart can
[25:44] be the soul. We refer to both of them
[25:47] as being both ways. But the heart is the
[25:50] heart of a man, the carnal, the heart
[25:54] is absolutely wicked
[25:58] in every way. If you've got to keep it
[26:00] under obedience,
[26:02] it's a battlefield.
[26:04] Amen.
[26:06] All right. And he said it it can change
[26:08] its mind. It can be up one time and down
[26:11] the next, be this way and that way and
[26:13] but that's not your absolute. Your
[26:16] absolute is in the soul.
[26:18] Right?
[26:20] The absolute is Christ. For for to me to
[26:23] live or or the scripture said for to to
[26:26] me or for me to live is Christ,
[26:30] right?
[26:30] And to die is gain. So we're not in a
[26:33] win-lose situation. We're in a win-win
[26:36] situation.
[26:38] Amen.
[26:40] Amen. That's exactly right. All right.
[26:42] So, he said he said it's it's the
[26:47] Christian life should be a stable life.
[26:48] It should be something that's that's a
[26:51] principle that that you are tied to that
[26:54] is more than life itself.
[27:00] But there has got to be a final tiepost.
[27:03] There's got to be something that's
[27:04] final.
[27:06] Amen.
[27:07] There's got to be a final for the
[27:09] Christian. The final is Christ,
[27:12] right?
[27:14] All right. So, so there has to be
[27:18] somewhere that man has got to tie for
[27:20] his eternal destination.
[27:23] Now, eternal isn't something you're just
[27:25] going to all of a sudden go to. Eternal
[27:27] is existing right now in you. If Christ
[27:30] is living in you, you are determined and
[27:32] identified as eternal life.
[27:34] Right. Yeah.
[27:34] Because he can't come and live with you
[27:36] without eternal life being there.
[27:38] Yeah.
[27:39] Of course. Amen.
[27:41] Amen.
[27:42] So, you had to have the seed of eternal
[27:45] life. You had to have the gene of
[27:47] eternal life. You had to be in him for
[27:49] the water of the word to to wash over in
[27:52] this hour. Because, brother, sister,
[27:54] we're not we're not ministers of letter.
[27:56] We're ministers of the mind or the mind
[28:00] of the word. We are ministers of the
[28:02] logos. We are ministers of the thought
[28:05] behind the word. We are ministers of the
[28:08] spirit.
[28:11] Amen.
[28:12] The letter is good, but and I've got
[28:14] this is I'm I'm kind of delving into
[28:16] something I'd like to touch on next time
[28:18] I minister here. And so I'll leave it
[28:20] lay that way.
[28:22] All right. So, so here now, but there is
[28:26] only one thing that I think is the final
[28:28] typost. And I believe that Paul had a
[28:30] typost in his life here. And I'd like to
[28:33] side in. Would you like to side in
[28:35] tonight? Let's side in,
[28:38] if we'd call it that way, and speak on
[28:40] that typos. He said, "For me to live is
[28:44] Christ, and to die is gain." Now, Christ
[28:46] was Paul's absolute.
[28:49] Amen. It was his typos. It was his.
[28:55] Brother Brandham just took that
[28:57] statement, made it right there. It was
[28:59] his. What about yours? Yeah.
[29:01] Right.
[29:03] If it was his
[29:05] and this is an individual affair, then
[29:07] what about you?
[29:10] Is it your typost?
[29:15] I say, God, open this to us. I I tell
[29:17] you, I've read that scripture I don't
[29:18] know how many times. Well, just in about
[29:19] the last two weeks, I read it again and
[29:21] it become alive to me.
[29:23] Yes.
[29:26] You can read it. You can read it. You
[29:28] say, "Yes, amen. I believe it." But when
[29:29] it's a revelation,
[29:32] that's when it's substance.
[29:34] That's when it's a change.
[29:37] And it's not saying you weren't changed.
[29:38] I'm just saying, you know how the word
[29:40] it just it all of a sudden here it is
[29:42] alive.
[29:45] You mentally ascended to it. You gave it
[29:47] a right mental attitude. But when it
[29:49] come alive,
[29:51] yeah,
[29:51] it's axe.
[29:53] Yeah.
[29:55] Amen.
[29:56] Hallelujah.
[29:58] All right. So for me, he said it was
[30:00] Paul's absolute. It was his. It was the
[30:03] end of all arguments.
[30:04] Isn't that wonderful? It's the end of
[30:06] all argument.
[30:07] Yes.
[30:09] You don't even have to try to explain
[30:10] why it's yours. You don't even have to
[30:12] try to explain it to nobody. It's the
[30:14] word. It's your absolute. It's the
[30:16] ultimate. And that settles it.
[30:18] Amen.
[30:19] When you rested on that like that, you
[30:21] watch God move.
[30:22] Yeah.
[30:22] And it and he's gonna move because he
[30:25] has to keep his word. And faith takes
[30:27] its resting place because what you're
[30:29] doing when you do that, you're placing
[30:31] faith by love. You're placing faith in
[30:34] the driver's seat.
[30:36] Right?
[30:36] Whose faith? His
[30:38] Yes.
[30:39] And so his faith takes a hold. Living by
[30:43] and man and and working by love, it's
[30:46] going to take God at his word. Faith is
[30:48] going to rest in his word. God's faith
[30:50] is going to take its resting place. It
[30:52] don't have to go any further. That's it.
[30:54] only believe,
[30:55] right?
[30:57] You don't add You don't say I believe
[30:59] and then add your feeling to it. You
[31:00] don't say I believe and then add human
[31:02] to it.
[31:03] It's not serving God plus human.
[31:05] Right?
[31:06] It's serving God in his faith, in his
[31:09] word. It's serving him by keeping what
[31:11] he said. If you love me, keep my word.
[31:14] Yeah.
[31:16] If he and and let the rule let the the
[31:19] Bible said, "Let the let the let God let
[31:23] the excuse me, let the peace of God rule
[31:27] your hearts."
[31:28] Right?
[31:29] That rule there is umpire.
[31:32] So let the peace of God umpire.
[31:35] If he said it's strike, settle it in
[31:36] your mind that it's a strike. Put it on
[31:38] the battlefield, then it's a strike and
[31:40] go on.
[31:41] If he said it's a ball, then put it as a
[31:43] ball and go on. If he said you're
[31:44] healed, you're healed.
[31:46] It isn't your feelings to it. He said
[31:48] you are, and you go forth and act on it,
[31:51] feed it, water it,
[31:53] and hold right there and give God praise
[31:55] and glory and thanks for all things and
[31:57] rejoice continually and giving forth a
[31:59] sacrifice of praise whether you feel
[32:01] like it or don't.
[32:02] Amen.
[32:05] Amen.
[32:07] That's worship.
[32:10] That's worship. Amen.
[32:13] You're not letting anything else come in
[32:15] your way. He said so. That settles it.
[32:18] I'm going to take him at his word. The
[32:21] problem is we haven't searched the
[32:23] scripture to see what is his will.
[32:26] We're accepting our feelings as his will
[32:28] instead of looking in the word and see
[32:30] what is his will. Instead of going back
[32:32] to a message, it was the perfect
[32:34] interpretation of the word for this
[32:36] hour. That perfect has come. And prophet
[32:38] said when he quoted that scripture he
[32:40] said for we have now the perfect
[32:42] interpretation of the word
[32:46] and we first have to see our rapture in
[32:48] faith or will never be a body change. We
[32:51] must first see the word by faith or
[32:53] they'll never come to manifestation.
[32:55] Right?
[32:58] It's not your mind over matter. It's not
[33:00] your feelings over matter. It's the word
[33:02] over matter.
[33:05] Praise the Lord.
[33:05] Hallelujah.
[33:08] That's right.
[33:09] Amen.
[33:10] So why are we not believing the word?
[33:11] Why are we allowing things to come
[33:13] between us that's not the word? It's
[33:15] time to take and pull up the bootstraps
[33:17] and say, "Lord, your word said so. I'm
[33:19] taking you at your word. I don't care
[33:22] what anyone says. Even the closest
[33:24] friend, children, husbands, wives, I
[33:27] don't care what it is. Your word said
[33:28] so. I'm going to take you at your word."
[33:31] Amen.
[33:32] And go acting on the word.
[33:34] Yes.
[33:39] Now you get in a situation where you
[33:41] won't even hardly read the scriptures
[33:43] anymore. You won't hardly even feed on
[33:45] the word. Why? Because it's going to
[33:47] expose.
[33:48] Because when light comes on the scene,
[33:50] it exposes darkness. Light exposes.
[33:53] Light does make manifest. That's why
[33:55] people hate to set under the opening of
[33:58] the word and the preaching of faith in
[34:00] that word because it exposes. It makes
[34:02] manifest. But when it does, you have a
[34:04] choice. You either accept it or you
[34:06] reject it.
[34:08] Amen.
[34:09] Brother and sister, we are not ministers
[34:11] of darkness. We are children of light.
[34:13] This bride is the child of light.
[34:15] Amen.
[34:16] We are children of the light.
[34:20] Amen.
[34:22] Praise the Lord. When you go to
[34:23] compromising on the word, you're
[34:25] flirting with the devil.
[34:29] Let me say that again. When you start
[34:31] compromising with that word and you
[34:33] start reasoning against it, you're
[34:34] flirting with the devil.
[34:36] Yeah.
[34:36] Because he'll get you to reason and say,
[34:38] "Here's what God meant. Here's why he
[34:40] said it." That's exactly what Eve
[34:42] listened to.
[34:44] Amen. But what was the difference
[34:46] between Cain and Abel? Both of them
[34:47] worshiped. Both of them heard from God.
[34:49] Both of them built a church. Both of
[34:51] them built a place of sacrifice.
[34:55] But one had a revelation of what God had
[34:59] and his will was and caught the
[35:01] revelation of why they fell.
[35:05] And Cain didn't. Yet God turned around
[35:08] and vindicated the message for the hour.
[35:10] Vindicated the prophet to be true.
[35:12] Vindicated his message to be right.
[35:18] Vindicated Abel's min Abel's revelation.
[35:22] Why didn't Cain accept it? It was right
[35:25] there vindicated before him. He even
[35:27] heard God speak.
[35:31] Both anointed to build the s build
[35:33] altars.
[35:38] Amen. Today, today we have the same
[35:40] thing. Both anointed by the Holy Spirit,
[35:42] but one can receive the word and the
[35:44] other can't.
[35:47] What's the difference? Not the
[35:49] anointing. The difference was the word
[35:51] for the season. The ability to hear what
[35:53] God's saying.
[35:55] That's right.
[35:57] That's the truth.
[36:02] Amen. All right. Now, so here we go.
[36:07] Hold on. One day, one day he was on his
[36:11] road to Damascus and he met Jesus face
[36:14] to face.
[36:16] The prophet said, "A minister don't even
[36:18] have a right to stand in this pulpit
[36:20] until on that sacred ground of his soul,
[36:22] he's met God face to face."
[36:28] Think of that.
[36:30] What about What about his body? What
[36:32] about the bride? What about Are they
[36:34] going to meet God face to face
[36:36] before they meet him in the air?
[36:38] You bet you they are because the new
[36:40] birth is a meeting of the person of
[36:42] Christ himself in you.
[36:44] Yeah.
[36:47] face to face.
[36:50] Christ who is our life.
[36:52] The Bible said Christ is our life. Did
[36:54] you know that? Who's he speaking to
[36:57] there? He's speaking to the believers.
[36:59] Christ is our life.
[37:01] Colossians chapter 4, Christ or three,
[37:03] Christ is our life.
[37:06] Yes.
[37:09] Amen. Yes.
[37:11] And when you meet him, you come face to
[37:14] face with yourself.
[37:18] Amen. That's exactly what the scripture
[37:20] said. Look into the word. If you've got
[37:22] a heart and and the ability to hear
[37:24] God's word, you didn't have that
[37:26] ability. You never manufactured that.
[37:28] You couldn't work that up. It's not
[37:30] something you did. It's the gift of God.
[37:33] Amen.
[37:35] Amen. By grace through faith. Faith is a
[37:38] gift of God.
[37:41] The gift of God is himself opened up and
[37:45] revealed in you
[37:48] which is eternal life.
[37:49] The gift of God is eternal life.
[37:52] Amen.
[37:53] Hallelujah.
[37:55] All right. So he said Paul met him face
[37:58] to face and from there on he cut loose
[38:01] from his Pharisee typost. And you're
[38:03] going to cut loose. You're going to cut
[38:05] loose because God in your walk with him
[38:07] is going to make sure you cut loose.
[38:09] He's going to put it before you to cut
[38:11] loose. He's going to bring conviction
[38:13] and show you this is not the right way.
[38:15] If he has to bring whatever he has to do
[38:17] to get you to do it, he's going to press
[38:19] you a little bit and you're going to
[38:21] make the right choice.
[38:22] Amen.
[38:23] Amen. And he but because he's already
[38:26] seen you make the right choice. He
[38:27] already ordained you to make the right
[38:29] choice. He said, "I chose you." Why? How
[38:32] did he choose us? Because he knew us.
[38:35] The reason we know him is because he
[38:37] knew us.
[38:38] Amen.
[38:40] Because we love him is because he loved
[38:42] us.
[38:44] We couldn't know him except he knew me.
[38:47] Now, it's not that he knew everything.
[38:48] He knew us. Remember he said he said to
[38:51] those that come to him in that day and
[38:53] said, "Lord, we've cast out devils in
[38:54] your name. We've done mighty miracles
[38:56] and wonders. We've we prophesied in your
[38:58] name, preached in your name, prophesied
[39:00] in your name." And he said, "Depart from
[39:02] me, you workers of iniquity, because you
[39:04] saw the word promised for the hour truly
[39:07] a vindicated." You saw the message. You
[39:09] saw it and refused it. Amen. And knowing
[39:13] to do good and doeth it not is iniquity,
[39:16] knowing to do what's right.
[39:19] And he said he he said, "Depart from me.
[39:22] I never knew you,
[39:28] but Lord, we were anointed by your
[39:30] spirit. Anointed,
[39:31] but I never knew you.
[39:35] You see, that's one of the mysteries of
[39:36] the hour
[39:38] is how that is.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:42] I never knew you. Now, I can talk this
[39:45] to real believers been around for a
[39:47] while.
[39:48] Amen.
[39:49] Amen. You ought to be grown up enough to
[39:52] realize now
[39:54] to to let off these ifs. What if? What
[39:57] ifs? What if? What if? What? You're
[40:00] under control of the Holy Ghost. You're
[40:02] being led by the Holy Spirit. What do
[40:04] you want?
[40:07] How can you have any more than that?
[40:09] He's leading you by the word. You see it
[40:11] in the word. Then why not lay down your
[40:13] own selfish, man-made ideas? Lay it down
[40:16] and come back to the word. Yeah.
[40:19] Come back to what a prophet said. Come
[40:22] back to the interpretation he's given us
[40:24] on this word and quit trying to put your
[40:26] opinion to it.
[40:30] That's harsh words, brother David. No,
[40:32] it's just boldly and love spoken.
[40:36] And I'm not trying to be anything. I'm
[40:38] just preaching the word God the way he
[40:40] gave it to me to minister it. So So if
[40:43] you don't like it, I'm sorry. Go to my
[40:45] head.
[40:47] talk to him.
[40:48] Right?
[40:48] Is that right?
[40:50] All right. So,
[40:53] so here we are. He had he he he said he
[40:56] cut loose. He retied himself again. That
[40:58] that Jesus who had who he knowed was
[41:01] crucified died and rose again. Paul knew
[41:04] it because he met the person. Paul knew
[41:06] it because he met the person.
[41:09] Who are you, Lord?
[41:12] I'm Jesus. You can I can you can you
[41:15] can't even imagine hardly what that was
[41:17] to Paul. Why you why are you persecuting
[41:19] me, Paul? Well, who are you? I'm the
[41:22] believer you're persecuting.
[41:23] Yeah,
[41:25] that's my seed.
[41:27] That's my life. You're persecuting me.
[41:30] Well, who are you, Lord? He knew that
[41:32] was the Lord.
[41:34] And he knew there was only one God, not
[41:35] a second person of the Godhead.
[41:37] Right?
[41:37] He knew who he was. He said, then who
[41:40] are you? He said, "I'm Jesus whom you
[41:42] persecute."
[41:45] Boy, that got him.
[41:48] He either could receive it or not
[41:50] receive it.
[41:53] He had a choice.
[41:56] Amen. Now, you're going to be brought to
[41:58] choice tonight.
[41:59] You need to go and look in the
[42:01] scripture. What you're doing and your
[42:02] attitude you're taking and what's
[42:04] happening. Is this with the word or
[42:05] isn't it? Right.
[42:10] Amen. And then go go hear what the
[42:12] prophet had to say about the word.
[42:15] See what he had to say about your
[42:16] situation.
[42:20] What did he say?
[42:22] Then line up with it. If it's your
[42:25] absolute, then it's the absolute. We
[42:27] believe the word of the Lord came to his
[42:29] prophet.
[42:29] Right?
[42:30] It was not William Brham's message yet.
[42:33] It was, but you know what I'm saying. It
[42:35] wasn't a man's message. It was the
[42:37] revealing of the son of man.
[42:40] That's right.
[42:41] Amen.
[42:42] Amen. Is that right?
[42:44] Yeah.
[42:44] You're not feeding on a man.
[42:46] Right.
[42:47] But his message is the coming of Christ.
[42:49] His message is the revealing of the son
[42:52] of man. His message is Christ in you.
[42:58] Amen. Amen. Somebody's going to receive
[43:00] the word. Somebody's going to make it
[43:02] manifest. And what is your position,
[43:04] bride? You're the expression of him.
[43:06] Right?
[43:07] I could jump ahead here, but I'll just
[43:09] hold back just a minute. I'm going to
[43:11] keep this right as tight as I can
[43:13] tonight. But one day, okay, he met God.
[43:17] That changed him right there. He met the
[43:18] person that changed him right there. He
[43:21] was never the same from then on.
[43:22] Something hap something in his heart
[43:24] said, "Amen. That's right."
[43:30] And where God sent another God sent a a
[43:32] messenger down to him.
[43:35] I can imagine he said, "What must I do
[43:37] then? What must I do to be born?" He
[43:39] said, "Repent, Paul."
[43:41] Yeah.
[43:42] You think you think Ananiah or is that
[43:44] was it Ananas? He said, he said, "You
[43:47] think he would have taken him some other
[43:49] direction?" No. He went right back to
[43:51] one that had the revelation in the key.
[43:53] He said, "Repent and be baptized in the
[43:56] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[43:57] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[43:59] of the Holy Ghost."
[44:00] Right?
[44:01] Paul said, "That's what I've been
[44:02] looking for. Then I that's what I want."
[44:06] And because the Bible said immediately
[44:08] he was taken out and was baptized.
[44:10] Yeah.
[44:11] Is that right? All right. Amen. He and I
[44:16] laid his hands on him and the scales
[44:17] come off his eyes.
[44:19] Amen. Boy, he was a changed man.
[44:23] I'll show him what great things he's got
[44:24] to suffer for me. Amen. Other words,
[44:28] what he reaps, he's going to have to
[44:29] sow,
[44:31] but he's mine
[44:33] and he's my messenger
[44:35] and he's going to preach and he's going
[44:38] to not care. He said,"None of these
[44:40] things move me." Paul said, Acts 20,
[44:42] "None of these things." He said, "Don't
[44:43] try to turn me away from going to
[44:45] Jerusalem."
[44:47] He knew he knew these things awaited
[44:49] him. He said, "But don't try to
[44:51] discourage me." He said, he said, I none
[44:54] of these things move me. I don't even
[44:56] count myself dear unto me. Boy, that's a
[44:59] good one.
[45:00] Right?
[45:01] How many how time many times we pamper
[45:03] oursel? Well, it doesn't fit my way of
[45:05] thinking. Doesn't fit the way I've had.
[45:07] Doesn't fit this. Be careful what you
[45:09] think. It don't fit.
[45:10] Right?
[45:11] You don't have to figure things out.
[45:12] Just take God at his word.
[45:14] Yes.
[45:16] Amen. Amen. All right. Now,
[45:21] Paul was born again. He was converted.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:26] Ezekiel 36. If you want, you don't have
[45:29] to turn. If you want to just listen to
[45:30] these things, but I I want to just get
[45:32] over there. E Ezekiel 36.
[45:36] You've heard it many times.
[45:39] I'm going to read I'm going to read here
[45:41] verse 26. A new heart also will I give
[45:44] you a new spirit will I put in within
[45:47] you. that spirit. Now, that's not the
[45:48] Holy Spirit. That's sanctification.
[45:51] I'll give you a new spirit. I'll
[45:53] sanctify it. Amen. Are you with me?
[45:56] Because you remember the spirit rules
[45:57] the body, controls the body. So, a new
[46:01] spirit I'll give you. Brother Bram said,
[46:03] when you couldn't even get along with
[46:04] your own spirit anymore, he said, "I'll
[46:05] give you a new spirit."
[46:07] All right? He said, "A new heart, a new
[46:10] spirit will I put in there." And then,
[46:12] and he said, "And I will take away that
[46:14] stony heart. I'll make it soft out of
[46:16] your flesh and I'll give you a heart of
[46:18] flesh. Other words, soft, pliable. I can
[46:21] work with it.
[46:23] All right. But then watch what he'll do.
[46:25] And I will put my spirit.
[46:27] Yes.
[46:29] And I'll put my spirit within you and
[46:32] cause you and what? And cause you.
[46:36] Oh, well, I can do it, Lord. No, you
[46:37] can't do it. I will cause you to do it.
[46:39] Amen.
[46:40] Then what will the spirit do? He can't
[46:42] lead you away from the word, but I'll
[46:44] lead you in the word.
[46:45] Right?
[46:47] Okay. So, he said, "I'll put my spirit
[46:49] within you and cause you to walk in my
[46:52] statutes." Not be a hearer only, but a
[46:54] doer.
[46:55] Yeah.
[46:56] I'll cause you to walk in my statutes.
[46:58] Other words, my word. And you shall keep
[47:01] my judgments. You shall keep them. Well,
[47:05] I got the Holy Spirit. Bless God. Why
[47:06] aren't you keeping his judgments?
[47:09] Now, I'm not saying you can't make
[47:10] mistakes and fail, but you're going to
[47:12] get back up and change it
[47:14] and keep on going in his word.
[47:16] You'll recognize it. You'll see it. And
[47:18] you'll change it.
[47:20] You won't continue down the same path.
[47:24] Let me just read something to you out of
[47:26] Proverbs. I wasn't going to read this,
[47:27] but just come to my heart. Is it okay if
[47:29] I follow the Holy Spirit here tonight?
[47:31] Is that fine? Okay. Proverbs 25
[47:34] 28 28. And this is where a lot of people
[47:38] fall and fail to to realize. 20 I got to
[47:42] get to it because I didn't have it
[47:43] planned. 28 and it's verse 13. He that
[47:46] coverth his sin shall not prosper.
[47:51] But who so confessth
[47:54] and
[47:56] here's the kicker.
[47:57] Yeah.
[47:57] Forsaketh them.
[48:00] Well, I've confessed it.
[48:02] Why don't you forsake it then?
[48:04] Right. Right. Why are you still living
[48:06] with it?
[48:07] Why you still under the bondage of it?
[48:09] Forsake it.
[48:12] Amen. And forsaketh it forsaketh them
[48:16] shall have mercy.
[48:20] That would mend a lot of marriages.
[48:25] I I guarantee it. Amen.
[48:29] And that would mend a lot of false ideas
[48:32] about marrying and not marrying, too.
[48:35] When your eyes come open, then why don't
[48:38] you walk in the truth?
[48:41] All right. Now,
[48:44] you may think I'm talking openly to
[48:46] somebody. Listen, I'm preaching to you
[48:47] the truth as God puts it in my mouth.
[48:51] If the shoe fits, like we always said,
[48:53] wear it.
[48:55] Let me I say, not I'm not pointing up to
[48:57] you. I have three pointing back at me.
[48:59] There more pointing at me than there is
[49:00] at you.
[49:02] I don't usually People don't usually
[49:04] point like this,
[49:07] but the biggest one is pointing back.
[49:12] Amen. All right. So, it's well for me as
[49:15] well for you. I have been through many
[49:17] trials and tests and I've been corrected
[49:19] many, many times and we'll still have
[49:21] correction and probably still make
[49:22] mistakes right up to the time I'm
[49:24] raptured.
[49:25] Right?
[49:26] You can't rely, you can't try to perfect
[49:30] your flesh.
[49:32] But you can stay true to the word and
[49:33] let God do the work in you like he wants
[49:35] to do and bring himself a manifestation
[49:38] through you. God will work if you quit
[49:40] trying
[49:41] and give it to him
[49:44] in yourself. Quit trying in yourself.
[49:47] It's not in I'm not asking you to try in
[49:49] yourself. I'm asking you to take a hold
[49:51] of what's in you. You say, "I'm born
[49:53] again." Then take a hold of what's in
[49:55] you
[49:57] and release it. Quit holding it captive.
[50:00] Quit trying to put it in a box of your
[50:02] thinking.
[50:06] All right. So now
[50:09] he retied himself. Okay? Now he never
[50:12] met a book. He met the person. He was
[50:15] never the same from then on. He never
[50:16] met a book. He never met a creed. He met
[50:18] the person, Jesus Christ. So Ezekiel
[50:21] says, I I've read it to you, verse 27.
[50:24] and I will dwell and and ye shall dwell
[50:27] in the land that I give to your fathers
[50:29] and you shall be my people and I will be
[50:32] your God. Amen. Now
[50:37] give a new heart. Brother Brham said
[50:38] give a new spirit and then he puts his
[50:40] spirit. He then he puts his spirit his
[50:44] spirit in you. You don't have to go
[50:47] around pretend that you're a Christian
[50:49] man or woman. You don't have to go
[50:51] around pretending it. It's not a put on.
[50:54] It's a life expressed. You don't It
[50:56] lives through you. It lives
[50:58] automatically through you.
[51:02] Amen. All right. The more you let go,
[51:06] when you let go, he hasn't let go. You
[51:09] let go of yourself.
[51:11] Right.
[51:12] He takes control of yourself.
[51:17] Amen. That's exactly what he said. Then
[51:20] then what does he say? What does he say
[51:22] you should do? lay your veil on his
[51:24] shoulders.
[51:27] Amen. And when you do, he accepts the
[51:30] obligation.
[51:31] Oh, but Lord, I'm afraid to lay my veil
[51:34] on his show shoulders. I'm I'm afraid
[51:36] I'm afraid what others are going to say
[51:37] to about me. If I let too far to go,
[51:41] then I lose my sense of reasoning. I
[51:43] lose my ability to think. I lose That's
[51:45] a devil talking to you.
[51:48] Okay. Are you with me?
[51:50] Lost anybody? All right. Now, now it's
[51:54] see what what is it? It's the wheel in
[51:56] the middle of the wheel.
[51:59] It's that little wheel, that hub.
[52:02] That wheel don't turn unless the hub
[52:04] turns.
[52:05] Right?
[52:05] Unless there's a power to that hub and
[52:07] that turns the wheel, the rest of the
[52:08] wheel turns. So, you have a little wheel
[52:10] in the middle of the wheel.
[52:14] That little wheel in your soul
[52:17] is a control room,
[52:18] right? Who lives in it determines the
[52:21] outcome,
[52:22] right?
[52:24] Amen. And who lives in it
[52:27] is who you are.
[52:29] Right.
[52:33] All right. 2 Corinthians 4:6. If you
[52:36] want to turn over there real quick. 2
[52:38] Corinthians 4 and verse 6. And we'll see
[52:41] here. He had I'm talking about born
[52:43] again, converted.
[52:45] Verse six. For God,
[52:49] For God who commanded the light to sh,
[52:51] how did what was his command? His
[52:54] thought expressed in a word. For God who
[52:58] commanded the light to shine out of
[53:00] darkness,
[53:04] hath shined in our hearts
[53:10] to give the light. What's it for? to
[53:12] give the light of the knowledge
[53:15] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[53:22] Christ.
[53:24] There is your face to face meeting right
[53:27] there.
[53:27] Right?
[53:28] Whose face are you seeing? His. What's
[53:32] his face? When you see his face,
[53:35] what's it reflecting back to you? Your
[53:38] face.
[53:41] So, it's a face-to-face meeting. You've
[53:43] met the person.
[53:46] Amen.
[53:48] There's your change right there.
[53:50] There's the birth.
[53:53] Amen. Without that, there is no birth.
[53:57] That's right.
[53:58] Amen. How can his seed be opened in you
[54:03] and not see him?
[54:06] And if you see him, you see yourself.
[54:09] Amen.
[54:10] Amen. Christ who is our life. When he
[54:12] shall appear, that's more than out here
[54:15] in the future. I'm not saying it isn't.
[54:17] But when Christ who is our life shall
[54:18] appear, we shall also appear with him
[54:21] right
[54:22] in glory.
[54:23] The glory of the revealed word, the
[54:25] glory of the rapture, the glory of all
[54:26] these things that we know has got to be.
[54:29] We're meeting him now
[54:31] for that purpose.
[54:32] Right?
[54:33] It's this faith. It's this faith of what
[54:36] he promised. This hope becoming
[54:38] substance is what's taking you there.
[54:40] Amen.
[54:43] Amen. Amen. All right. So, face to face
[54:48] 2 Corinthians 4:6 with who you are, the
[54:51] new birth in your soul. That's the real
[54:53] you. You've passed from death to life.
[54:58] Now, what's the word? What think he of
[55:00] the word now? What think he of Christ?
[55:04] He's a little wheel in the middle of the
[55:05] wheel. He's the stone cut out of the
[55:07] mountain without hands. Heweed out
[55:09] without hands. A sharp instrument.
[55:12] Amen. Where was that stone? What
[55:14] mountain was it in? Pyramid.
[55:18] That's exactly where it was.
[55:21] Amen.
[55:22] And it was an unwritten word. John was
[55:24] forbidden to write it. But you're a rock
[55:27] in that rock. You're a stone in that
[55:29] stone.
[55:32] Amen. What is What's the word promised
[55:34] for the hour? The capstone ministry.
[55:37] What is it? It's the revealing of what?
[55:39] The son of man. What was this picture
[55:42] taken for? What is it for? He's uniting
[55:44] with his people. We've turned a corner.
[55:47] It's the bride coming of Christ.
[55:50] That's what he promised to come
[55:51] manifested in. That's the royal seed to
[55:53] the royal promised son. Brother Brandham
[55:55] said, "And that's the promise of the
[55:57] hour."
[56:00] And who is it revealing? The son of man
[56:02] again.
[56:05] All right. So where is the re what what
[56:08] is the bride? It's the true revelation
[56:10] of Jesus Christ in the bride form.
[56:12] Amen.
[56:14] Expressing itself in the formation of
[56:16] the bride.
[56:19] I know that's going online.
[56:25] You know what those fanatics believe?
[56:27] They believe they're Christ.
[56:29] Not only believe it, we know it.
[56:33] Well, they have the they have a a man
[56:35] back 2,000 years ago in that form, but
[56:38] this is the same person in another form.
[56:41] It's the anointed word in you. Christ
[56:43] the anointed one in you. For me to live
[56:46] is Christ the anointed word.
[56:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Galatians,
[56:55] he said, "No, I'm sorry. The Christ
[56:59] centered life." All right. Now
[57:02] it's 1 John 4:4 said, "You are of God,
[57:05] little children, and greater is he that
[57:07] is in you than he that is of the world."
[57:09] You know the scripture. All right? You
[57:11] are of God.
[57:13] Said, "Greater is he that is in you."
[57:16] What is in you, brother Rams? In the
[57:19] message, he that is in you, 1963, he
[57:22] says this. He said, "What is in you
[57:25] that's greater? It's Christ.
[57:28] He the anointed. It's Christ the
[57:30] anointed.
[57:32] Not Christ sing plural. It's Christ the
[57:35] anointed.
[57:37] The anointed God that was in Christ that
[57:39] was in Christ is in you.
[57:42] Same spirit.
[57:45] Same works. Why? Because St. John 14:12
[57:48] said, "He that believeth in me,
[57:50] right?
[57:52] The works I do, not the works I did."
[57:55] Yeah. But the works I do now.
[57:58] The works I'm doing now, you shall do
[58:00] also. Jesus said, "My father workketh,
[58:02] and I workketh hitherto."
[58:04] He's working at this moment, and my
[58:06] flesh is is moved and brought under
[58:08] submission to him. He shows me, and I do
[58:11] it.
[58:13] That same harmony, not vision, but same
[58:16] harmony of revelation is to exist
[58:18] between the bride and the groom today.
[58:20] That same harmony, he shows her and she
[58:23] carries it out. Amen.
[58:28] Amen.
[58:29] That's right.
[58:31] You see, we're coming to our pos we are
[58:33] realizing our positive position. This
[58:36] message was a message of maturity. This
[58:38] message is a message of the maturity of
[58:41] himself in the bride form.
[58:43] That's right.
[58:44] Praise the Lord.
[58:45] Praise the Lord. That's exactly right.
[58:47] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother
[58:48] David. That's it.
[58:50] Praise the Lord.
[58:51] Amen.
[58:54] Boy, you had your part to play right
[58:56] then.
[58:58] That's it. That's that's that's it.
[59:00] That's the truth. That's how simple it
[59:02] is.
[59:04] She said the right thing.
[59:06] Amen.
[59:08] Is that right? At the right time.
[59:12] Acknowledged it.
[59:15] The amen is the acknowledge of it. It
[59:17] comes from another source. It's just not
[59:19] a mental amen. It's a soul amen. That's
[59:23] right.
[59:24] That's the truth.
[59:26] And so be it unto me if it takes the
[59:28] hide off me. So be it unto me to let
[59:30] your name be magnified and to obey your
[59:33] command and your word. For to me to live
[59:35] is Christ. So be it unto me if it brings
[59:38] every trial, every test, every
[59:39] heartache, everything else. I'm willing
[59:42] to stand in that position and allow it
[59:44] to be. Because God is not an author of
[59:46] frustration. He's not an author of fr.
[59:49] He's not here to frustrate you. He has a
[59:51] purpose in allowing these trials. He had
[59:53] a purpose to allowing these tests. He's
[59:55] trying to get you out of yourself and
[59:57] conquer yourself and show you
[1:00:00] that who you are in your position.
[1:00:02] Amenise.
[1:00:06] All right. That's the message of the
[1:00:08] hour.
[1:00:10] Amen.
[1:00:11] That's the mystery of the seventh seal.
[1:00:14] It was an un the seal opened up unveiled
[1:00:16] a mystery. But when the mysteries
[1:00:18] unveiled,
[1:00:20] it's then a secret hidden.
[1:00:23] It was it was a it was a mystery hidden.
[1:00:25] God hid God kept it hid until this end
[1:00:28] time.
[1:00:30] John, because John knew what it said,
[1:00:33] then we had to come here at the end and
[1:00:35] it had to be a revelation to know what
[1:00:37] it said. Brother Bram said it didn't
[1:00:39] utter for nothing.
[1:00:42] That's right.
[1:00:44] That's right.
[1:00:45] Why? It's showing the bride the secret
[1:00:48] of his coming.
[1:00:50] And this is what's happening to the
[1:00:52] bride. It is a secret catching away. It
[1:00:55] is only for the bride. It's for her.
[1:00:57] She's a special class of people. It's
[1:00:59] not for me to say you're in and I you're
[1:01:01] out. But I'll tell you, your fruit of
[1:01:04] receiving the teaching, the promise of
[1:01:06] the word for the season is going to be
[1:01:08] the evidence of where you're standing.
[1:01:13] Not the anointing. You'd be anointed.
[1:01:14] There's an anointing. And I'm thankful
[1:01:16] for the anointing. I believe in the
[1:01:18] anointing. If I didn't have the
[1:01:19] anointing, there'd be no seed come to
[1:01:21] life within me.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] But the anointing can fall. It fall on
[1:01:25] the whole group. It fell on on at the
[1:01:28] day of Pentecost upon all flesh.
[1:01:31] But not all flesh were predestinated
[1:01:33] seed.
[1:01:34] Amen.
[1:01:37] Here's two prophets, Micah and Zedekiah,
[1:01:39] both anointed. Brother Ram said, both
[1:01:41] anointed of the Holy Ghost. Both saying,
[1:01:43] "Thus sayaeth the Lord." What made the
[1:01:45] difference? The teaching of ma ma Micah
[1:01:48] because he went back to the Elijah a
[1:01:51] vindicated prophet before him and said
[1:01:53] this is what he said for this season. It
[1:01:56] looks reasonable that you're saying
[1:01:58] Syria has no right to come and take our
[1:01:59] land. But it's not the season,
[1:02:01] right?
[1:02:02] And who's going to hear the word for the
[1:02:04] season? That elect bride is going to
[1:02:07] hear and receive the word for the season
[1:02:09] for her to live is Christ. Amen.
[1:02:12] He's always the word for the season.
[1:02:16] Amen.
[1:02:18] Amen. Hallelujah. What's our season?
[1:02:21] Yes.
[1:02:22] The uniting of the headstone with the
[1:02:24] body.
[1:02:25] Right.
[1:02:26] We have a capstone ministry.
[1:02:29] Amen.
[1:02:29] That's not a Pentecostal message. That's
[1:02:32] the message of the rapture.
[1:02:36] What a resurrection that was. And what a
[1:02:39] resurrection this is. become out of dark
[1:02:41] denominationalism and become the very
[1:02:43] thing that God promised this hour that
[1:02:45] the bride would be the that would be
[1:02:47] himself his coming in bride form. He had
[1:02:50] to fulfill that in order to bring it
[1:02:52] back to that seventh day of Eden.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] Amen.
[1:03:01] I know there's Satan hates this kind of
[1:03:03] preaching because it positionally puts
[1:03:05] us where we belong. It wasn't the
[1:03:06] anointing. It was the teaching that was
[1:03:09] in there. Balam didn't had the didn't
[1:03:11] have a wrong anointing. He had and he
[1:03:13] prophesied things that were true.
[1:03:15] But what was it? His teaching was an
[1:03:18] air.
[1:03:18] That's right.
[1:03:19] We're not all the same. We are
[1:03:21] different.
[1:03:22] That's right.
[1:03:23] He brought us down here to say a little
[1:03:25] a little eating together, a little
[1:03:27] fellowship around. Even Polycarp felt
[1:03:29] that way.
[1:03:31] Right.
[1:03:31] But look at what Irenius did when he
[1:03:33] came. He was militant against any form
[1:03:36] of organization.
[1:03:37] Amen.
[1:03:40] It's an individual affair between you
[1:03:42] and God.
[1:03:43] I believe in coming to church, but don't
[1:03:45] let church go on beyond what it is. It's
[1:03:47] a meeting place where we can hear the
[1:03:49] word and receive it. But this is an
[1:03:51] individual affair.
[1:03:53] Amen.
[1:03:59] I thank the Lord. Every time the
[1:04:00] anointing falls, we shout and praise the
[1:04:02] Lord just as just as hard as the tears
[1:04:05] can or the tears can as hard as a wheat
[1:04:06] can.
[1:04:08] That's right. That's right. But don't
[1:04:11] judge it by how many miracles you can
[1:04:13] bring or what you can do because they
[1:04:15] can do the same thing under the power of
[1:04:17] the spirit. There's no devil gets cast
[1:04:18] out. No healing takes place. No miracles
[1:04:21] except God do it.
[1:04:26] But in the beginning was the word and
[1:04:29] the word was with God
[1:04:32] and the word was God.
[1:04:38] Amen. So, it's the ability that God's
[1:04:40] given for you to hear the word
[1:04:43] for your season.
[1:04:46] That's the fruit he's seeing produced.
[1:04:50] It's not a mental affair. It's not a
[1:04:52] pumpup affair. It's not a It's a birth
[1:04:54] affair. It's a word affair. It's a word
[1:04:58] maturing.
[1:05:00] Amen.
[1:05:01] That's why you're seeing that's why
[1:05:03] you're seeing one side is going to go
[1:05:04] right off and because that because the
[1:05:07] the union of churches will look so
[1:05:10] reasonable and such a such so so
[1:05:12] reasonable. You don't want to lose your
[1:05:14] privileges. You don't want to lose this.
[1:05:15] It looks so reasonable to join up with
[1:05:17] them and continue to preach the message.
[1:05:21] But it's an error.
[1:05:24] I could go on more and more bring up the
[1:05:26] quote in church age book. You know where
[1:05:28] I'm talking about.
[1:05:29] It looked very reasonable. look
[1:05:31] inviting. Brother Brandham said, "The
[1:05:33] temptation will be as follows."
[1:05:35] And he told us exactly what it was. And
[1:05:38] we see that denominational spirit
[1:05:39] working amongst in around the people of
[1:05:42] the message. It's going to fall right
[1:05:44] into that.
[1:05:46] They'll side right with it.
[1:05:48] Because it's not unreasonable. It looks
[1:05:51] reasonable, but it's not the word.
[1:05:55] Now, there's a whole message could be
[1:05:56] preached on that. Amen. Amen. And I
[1:06:01] Anyway, I'm getting off track here.
[1:06:03] Let's Let's get centered back here. I
[1:06:05] need to wrap it up. All right. Now,
[1:06:14] it's the end of everything. It's the end
[1:06:15] of all strife, the end of arguments.
[1:06:18] Everything was gone. You see, now we're
[1:06:20] not a divided people. We've got to be in
[1:06:22] unity. Be talking about the bride here.
[1:06:24] Because each one of us is holding a part
[1:06:27] of God.
[1:06:29] See, the word can't deny the word.
[1:06:31] Brother Bram said, "Elect cannot
[1:06:32] persecute elect."
[1:06:34] Right.
[1:06:36] Amen. The elect cannot persecute elect.
[1:06:41] Amen. They're going to be in unity under
[1:06:43] one head and unified under the word.
[1:06:46] Yes.
[1:06:46] For the hour, for the time, the season.
[1:06:50] What is the season?
[1:06:53] Well, one way, as I said, we've already
[1:06:55] said it's capstone season. the time for
[1:06:58] the union. It's the marriage season. The
[1:07:01] marriage has come.
[1:07:04] Not the rapture, the marriage. He the
[1:07:06] rapture is going to the wedding supper.
[1:07:08] He said, he said, "Now the marriage has
[1:07:11] come and the the ministry of the son of
[1:07:14] man is uniting the two together."
[1:07:18] Amen. There you are. So, you see what's
[1:07:21] happening? Why you're peculiar? Because
[1:07:23] God's uniting the two together.
[1:07:27] Amen. You want to read that? That's in
[1:07:28] proving his word, Jeffersonville.
[1:07:31] The end. Amen. He makes it very clear.
[1:07:34] All right. And he goes right on. Right
[1:07:36] on all the way to communion and makes it
[1:07:38] very clear.
[1:07:41] All right. I've got to All right. Now, a
[1:07:44] Christ centered life. Now, watch what he
[1:07:46] says.
[1:07:49] Paul said, "Nothing present, nothing
[1:07:50] future, death, sickness, sorrow can
[1:07:53] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:07:55] in Christ Jesus." Nothing. Nothing.
[1:07:58] Nothing present, nothing future, death,
[1:08:01] sickness, sorrow can separate us from
[1:08:04] the love of God that's in Christ Jesus.
[1:08:10] Brother Brown, I'm preaching the
[1:08:11] message. God's word calls for a total
[1:08:13] separation from unbelief. He said
[1:08:15] anyone, anything, anybody that comes
[1:08:17] between you and keeping and holding and
[1:08:19] act and believing that word is the
[1:08:22] devil.
[1:08:24] It's unbelief.
[1:08:25] Yeah.
[1:08:28] And he called for it. God called for a
[1:08:32] separation. God calls for a total
[1:08:34] separation from unbelief.
[1:08:37] Not the person. We're not talking about
[1:08:38] person flesh man. We're talking about
[1:08:41] spirits here.
[1:08:43] They rise up. Amen. Very nice people,
[1:08:46] very close to you. Some of the closest
[1:08:48] people next to you, but they'll raise up
[1:08:50] and divide you from doing what you
[1:08:52] should be doing, where you should be
[1:08:54] walking,
[1:08:54] right?
[1:08:55] Where you should be living,
[1:08:56] right?
[1:08:58] Amen. Then that becomes if you listen to
[1:09:01] that, that becomes that becomes you're
[1:09:03] taking and putting that in position over
[1:09:05] the word.
[1:09:09] And that should not be and cannot be so.
[1:09:13] Amen. That's right. God will never bless
[1:09:16] that.
[1:09:19] All right. So, we go back. There's a lot
[1:09:21] of things could be said on this. In
[1:09:22] fact, a lot of quotes of this, but we
[1:09:25] can't do that. Save time. Now, no matter
[1:09:28] how much science raises up and says
[1:09:30] this, see, it's a tiepost. You know,
[1:09:32] something's happened. No matter who says
[1:09:35] it, no matter what says it, no matter
[1:09:37] anyone, you are tied. You and God become
[1:09:40] one.
[1:09:41] Amen.
[1:09:42] You and God become one.
[1:09:46] What's that absolute? What you're tied
[1:09:48] to? Unlimited in power. What's Christ?
[1:09:51] Unlimited in power. Ultimate.
[1:09:55] Perfect.
[1:09:58] Is that right?
[1:09:59] Then you expect your leadership to be
[1:10:01] perfect. If he if you're doing something
[1:10:02] that isn't right and he shows it to you,
[1:10:04] why don't you just simply lay yourself
[1:10:07] down, take up your cross, and follow
[1:10:09] him.
[1:10:13] That's exactly right.
[1:10:16] All right. Now, Christ centered life, it
[1:10:19] was a different life than you once had.
[1:10:25] You once had an educational conception,
[1:10:27] mental conception, but now you have a
[1:10:30] got a Christ centered life, an absolute.
[1:10:33] There's going to be a bride that's been
[1:10:35] elected since the foundation of the
[1:10:37] world that's going to be tied to that
[1:10:39] typost.
[1:10:43] Are you one of them? When the bride gets
[1:10:45] the true revelation and what she is, she
[1:10:48] st what she stands for and that she can
[1:10:50] do the greater works, she will be an
[1:10:52] invincible army. If they get a true
[1:10:54] revelation of the two spirits with true
[1:10:57] and false vine, two seed, two spirits
[1:11:00] within the framework of the Christian
[1:11:02] church. Amen. He spoke to both all
[1:11:04] through seven ages. Is that right?
[1:11:06] Through the framework of the Christian
[1:11:08] church and by God's spirit discern. How
[1:11:11] you going to discern? How you going to
[1:11:13] when the two spirits are so close,
[1:11:15] right?
[1:11:15] The anointing this anointing is com is
[1:11:18] is the same, but the outcome isn't the
[1:11:21] same.
[1:11:21] Right? You believe Judas was anointed to
[1:11:23] cast out devils?
[1:11:24] Yes.
[1:11:25] Bet he was. He received the power.
[1:11:27] Yeah. What was he?
[1:11:29] What was he inside? A son of predition,
[1:11:32] a son of the devil.
[1:11:35] Isn't that something?
[1:11:37] And if that was then, what about his
[1:11:39] second return of Christ and coming here
[1:11:42] today? Where would it be?
[1:11:44] Right?
[1:11:45] And who's going to discern the
[1:11:46] difference? It'd be so close it would
[1:11:48] deceive the elect, if possible.
[1:11:52] And you're beginning to see a greater
[1:11:54] separation because the maturity of the
[1:11:57] word is here.
[1:11:59] And you're seeing you're seeing people
[1:12:01] very close, but they're still back here
[1:12:03] preaching a message not of the day, but
[1:12:05] of a day gone by.
[1:12:11] Amen. They're they're preaching. We
[1:12:12] believe in a Pentecostal message. We
[1:12:14] believe in life. We believe in that
[1:12:16] life. But the Pentecostal message
[1:12:19] denominated and was shook.
[1:12:21] You follow what I'm saying?
[1:12:23] All right. Then we're not preaching
[1:12:25] that.
[1:12:28] That's not our ministry.
[1:12:30] We had to come through that. Brother
[1:12:31] Brham said the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:33] made way for the Holy Ghost himself
[1:12:35] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:12:37] the word. That's where we're at. That's
[1:12:39] our day.
[1:12:41] Amen. Exactly. All right.
[1:12:47] See the token,
[1:12:49] the token is the literal life of Christ
[1:12:51] in you.
[1:12:52] That's why this preaching like this
[1:12:54] because we're talking about the token.
[1:12:56] Yeah.
[1:12:58] You must have the token and it must be
[1:13:00] applied.
[1:13:03] Well, I'm afraid if I apply it, I'm
[1:13:04] going to hurt feelings.
[1:13:07] Don't you let the devil lie to you that
[1:13:08] way.
[1:13:09] Right.
[1:13:10] You're not going to hurt anybody's
[1:13:11] feelings by taking the word and standing
[1:13:13] on it.
[1:13:14] Right. That's right.
[1:13:15] You may offend people. You may hurt
[1:13:17] feelings.
[1:13:19] But that doesn't turn you away from the
[1:13:20] word. If that turns you away from the
[1:13:22] headship of Christ, there's something
[1:13:24] wrong in your relationship with God.
[1:13:27] Nobody wants to hurt feelings. Nobody
[1:13:29] wants to offend anybody.
[1:13:31] But you're going to offend. I'm going to
[1:13:33] tell you right now, when you take your
[1:13:34] stand for this truth and preach the
[1:13:36] truth, you're going to offend somebody.
[1:13:40] It's not intentional, but it happens.
[1:13:42] Right.
[1:13:43] If I went out and intentionally offended
[1:13:45] people, I would have I would be a wrong
[1:13:48] spirit.
[1:13:51] Amen. But how many times would Jesus
[1:13:53] offended by their reaction to what he
[1:13:55] said?
[1:13:56] Right.
[1:13:58] Amen. See? All right. Now,
[1:14:05] so discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:14:07] spirit. Satan will be powerless before
[1:14:09] her.
[1:14:11] Galatians 2:20 said that. Let's go over
[1:14:15] there. I've got to read it to you.
[1:14:16] You've read it many, many times. But I
[1:14:18] don't care how many times you read
[1:14:20] something. It's when it's quickened.
[1:14:23] Verse 20, 220. I am crucified with
[1:14:25] Christ. How many is here crucified with
[1:14:27] Christ?
[1:14:28] I am crucified with Christ.
[1:14:30] Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but
[1:14:32] Christ liveth in me. How the devil is so
[1:14:35] quick because we get in the flesh.
[1:14:36] Sometimes we answer roughly, we do
[1:14:39] something and right away pointing the
[1:14:40] finger. See, if you had the spirit of
[1:14:41] God, you wouldn't have done that,
[1:14:43] right?
[1:14:44] Anybody is that me or is that anybody
[1:14:46] else here? But our Lord is not judging
[1:14:50] you,
[1:14:51] right?
[1:14:52] By the outer man.
[1:14:54] He's judging in what you're going to do
[1:14:57] with what you see you did. Are you going
[1:15:00] to change?
[1:15:01] And you say, "Yes, I shouldn't have done
[1:15:03] that. I'm sorry." You're quick to
[1:15:05] forgive. And you should be quick
[1:15:09] to accept it.
[1:15:13] Hit their forgiveness asking for it.
[1:15:17] Amen. Was Jesus forgiving?
[1:15:21] Absolutely.
[1:15:23] I'm glad I can be forgiven.
[1:15:26] I'm glad God isn't looking at me and
[1:15:28] say, "Uhuh. Uh oh." No. It's not a law.
[1:15:31] It's life. It's the intent of your soul.
[1:15:35] But if that intent is right, you never
[1:15:37] intended to do it in the first place.
[1:15:39] And when you realize, as soon as you do
[1:15:41] it, you know it's wrong. And how many
[1:15:44] times we get in the flesh and say things
[1:15:46] we shouldn't say.
[1:15:47] And yet somebody next to you is quick to
[1:15:50] judge you that you were wrong and
[1:15:51] shouldn't have done that. Then let's see
[1:15:53] you perfect.
[1:15:54] That's right.
[1:15:56] Let's see you perfect.
[1:16:00] My wife has seen the carnal side of me.
[1:16:02] I've seen her carnal side. But do I
[1:16:04] stand here and say, "Well, no, that that
[1:16:06] anols the marriage right there. We're
[1:16:08] not married now." That does not change
[1:16:11] my relationship with her.
[1:16:15] Amen.
[1:16:16] That's the truth. Doesn't change the
[1:16:18] relationship. I was I was meant to marry
[1:16:20] her from the foundation of the world. I
[1:16:23] We come as one. Our relationship doesn't
[1:16:25] change. We might be strained in our
[1:16:28] fellowship.
[1:16:31] Hello
[1:16:33] Hello. Must have hit a cord. Might be
[1:16:37] strained in the fellowship a little bit,
[1:16:40] but it doesn't change the relationship,
[1:16:42] right?
[1:16:43] And I don't care if he's an outright
[1:16:45] sinner, an unbeliever. You're to serve
[1:16:47] him. And I don't care if she's an
[1:16:48] outright sinner believer. If she's
[1:16:50] willing to live with you,
[1:16:52] keep it. Stay there.
[1:17:00] Let's go back to the word.
[1:17:03] Amen. Go back to the word.
[1:17:08] Amen. Now, a lot could be said on that
[1:17:10] and someday I may just have to take a
[1:17:11] message unless I expect my pastor to
[1:17:14] beat me to it.
[1:17:19] No, I can't say that. If the Lord wills,
[1:17:22] we will do thus and thus.
[1:17:26] All right. When the bride gets a true
[1:17:29] revelation. All right. Now that's tells
[1:17:31] that's the difference.
[1:17:34] So So I am crucified with Christ. What
[1:17:38] time I got? Okay. I'm crucified with
[1:17:40] Christ. Nevertheless, I live lived. Yet
[1:17:42] not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the
[1:17:44] life which I now live in the flesh.
[1:17:47] Notice it's not I but Christ living in
[1:17:49] me. And the life which I now live in the
[1:17:52] flesh, I live by the faith of who?
[1:17:57] Same faith.
[1:17:59] All right.
[1:18:03] Then who's greater in you? It's Christ
[1:18:05] the anointed. God was in Christ as in
[1:18:07] you. Greater is he that is in you. He
[1:18:09] that's in the than he that's in the
[1:18:10] world. Then if he's in you, it's not you
[1:18:13] anymore living. It's him living in you.
[1:18:17] Yes.
[1:18:18] This is who you are. The real you in the
[1:18:22] soul.
[1:18:23] Him living in you. That's who you are.
[1:18:26] Right.
[1:18:27] All right. It's not it. See, it's not
[1:18:30] your thinking what you think about this.
[1:18:32] It's what he said about this. See, then
[1:18:34] then if he's in you, he absolutely would
[1:18:36] not deny what he said. He couldn't do
[1:18:38] it. Then he he would keep what he has
[1:18:41] said. And he's trying to find that
[1:18:43] person that he can vindicate himself
[1:18:45] through.
[1:18:47] Paragraph 68 of perfect faith. The
[1:18:49] believer that we're talking about the
[1:18:51] true believer because he's speaking to
[1:18:53] true believers. Talking about perfect
[1:18:54] faith, true believers. Okay. He said the
[1:18:57] believer is the faith of God moving in
[1:19:01] you.
[1:19:02] That's the believer.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:05] Okay. What is the believer? It's the
[1:19:07] revelation of God.
[1:19:11] The believer is the revelation or the
[1:19:13] substance of God.
[1:19:16] Substance faith. All right. He said
[1:19:19] first John 5:4, he said, "This is the
[1:19:23] victory that overcometh the world, even
[1:19:26] our faith." There's the believer. Our is
[1:19:29] the believer.
[1:19:31] All right. Then our faith is what? The
[1:19:34] faith of God.
[1:19:35] No wonder it overcomes the world because
[1:19:38] it's the faith of God moving or action
[1:19:40] in you. It's the word living and action.
[1:19:43] He said that's what the bride would be.
[1:19:45] It would be the word living and action.
[1:19:48] The word becomes living and it becomes
[1:19:50] operative in you.
[1:19:52] Yes.
[1:19:53] Amen. All right. So he said he said then
[1:19:58] the believer
[1:20:00] that's the believer is our faith of the
[1:20:04] true believer the faith of God the
[1:20:06] revelation of God. Psalm 62:2 you don't
[1:20:09] have to turn there. I'm just going to
[1:20:10] read it. I'm just going to quote it. He
[1:20:12] said he is my rock. speaking of God. Two
[1:20:16] or three places in that scripture, he
[1:20:17] said, "He, God is my rock." And brother
[1:20:21] Brandham came right down to the message
[1:20:23] shalom and said that rock there means
[1:20:26] revelation.
[1:20:28] He said in the scripture, rock means
[1:20:31] revelation. And he said, "So God is my
[1:20:33] revelation." That's the believer. The
[1:20:36] believer in you is that faith.
[1:20:40] Amen.
[1:20:42] Revelation of God.
[1:20:45] That's the believer's identity. That's
[1:20:47] the believer's position is the
[1:20:49] revelation of God
[1:20:52] in you. All right? That brings you and
[1:20:56] the and him as one.
[1:20:58] 2 Samuel 22. Let me just move over there
[1:21:01] real quick. 2 Samuel
[1:21:04] 22.
[1:21:06] Well, I thought I had that marked. I
[1:21:08] don't. Okay,
[1:21:11] let me get it here real quick.
[1:21:14] Or maybe I do. No.
[1:21:23] Okay. 2 Samuel 22. Okay. And verse
[1:21:28] what do I have marked here? Okay. Two.
[1:21:31] The spirit of the Lord spake by me and
[1:21:34] his word was in my tongue. And the God
[1:21:37] of Israel said, the rock of Israel spake
[1:21:40] to me. He that ruleth over men must be
[1:21:43] just, ruling in the fear of God. Amen.
[1:21:48] I'm sorry. That's 23. I'm sorry. I
[1:21:50] thought that didn't sound just right.
[1:21:52] But the rock part is right.
[1:21:54] Chapter 22, verse two. And the Lord and
[1:21:58] he said, this is David
[1:22:01] spake unto the Lord.
[1:22:03] And he said, the Lord is my rock and my
[1:22:07] fortress and my deliverer. Now the Bible
[1:22:10] said the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:22:12] tower. The righteous run into it and are
[1:22:15] safe.
[1:22:16] All right. Then what is the name of the
[1:22:18] Lord? The presence and person of Christ
[1:22:20] in you
[1:22:22] is your strong tower. All right. So and
[1:22:26] he said Lord is my rock and my fortress
[1:22:28] and my deliverer. The God of my rock. In
[1:22:31] him will I trust. He is my shield, horn
[1:22:35] of my salvation, my high tower and my
[1:22:38] refuge. My savior.
[1:22:41] Thou saveest me from violence. I will
[1:22:43] call upon the Lord who is worthy to be
[1:22:46] praised.
[1:22:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:52] The real you, the prophet said, the you,
[1:22:55] the real you, is the spirit of God in
[1:22:59] you.
[1:23:01] All right. Isaiah 59:19
[1:23:05] said this, "So shall they fear the name
[1:23:09] of the Lord from the west and his glory
[1:23:11] from the rising of the sun. When the
[1:23:13] enemy shall come in like a flood, the
[1:23:15] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:23:18] standard against him."
[1:23:21] And brother Brandham said, "Are you one
[1:23:24] of them?"
[1:23:26] Then the standard isn't off here
[1:23:28] somewhere,
[1:23:29] right? It is this word but it's a
[1:23:32] thought here revealed in you
[1:23:35] of this
[1:23:36] that is a person that is a logos that's
[1:23:39] God's thought you were in that thinking
[1:23:43] amen to be expressed in your day and how
[1:23:46] are you expressed by the word
[1:23:53] hallelujah all right now So
[1:23:59] then you are the standard, the absolute
[1:24:02] living word in your soul, veiled behind
[1:24:04] your flesh.
[1:24:07] Now she, the bride, is Hebrews 13:8.
[1:24:13] His coming is the secret. She alone
[1:24:16] knows.
[1:24:18] What is what is this revealed? What is
[1:24:21] this formation of the bride? What what
[1:24:23] is it doing? It's revealing the coming
[1:24:25] of the son of man again. He had to come
[1:24:28] in that form. Okay, I've been through
[1:24:30] that. Let me just keep going. I'm about
[1:24:31] finished. Where in the We're in the last
[1:24:34] days and the last hours of the day. Do
[1:24:37] you see him now in his word and all of
[1:24:40] his word made manifest right here before
[1:24:42] us? Oh church of the living God. Get to
[1:24:44] your feet. Believe in him and all that's
[1:24:46] in you. With all that's in you. Hold to
[1:24:49] that little wheel in the middle of the
[1:24:50] wheel. Let it stabilize every move and
[1:24:53] every motion you make, every thought
[1:24:55] that you have. May it be controlled by
[1:24:57] this tower on the inside of you. Because
[1:25:00] God is setting right in his word of this
[1:25:03] hour. You He is sitting right in his
[1:25:06] word.
[1:25:06] Amen.
[1:25:07] Where is it? Right here tonight. He's
[1:25:10] sitting right in his word of this hour
[1:25:12] in the evening light showing forth the
[1:25:15] light.
[1:25:16] Amen.
[1:25:17] I spoke this morning and last Sunday
[1:25:20] morning on the wheel in the middle of
[1:25:21] the wheel or that little inside soul on
[1:25:24] the inside of the spirit.
[1:25:28] So the soul controls the spirit and the
[1:25:31] spirit controls the body.
[1:25:35] Amen. Then if you give way and and give
[1:25:38] and give yourself to what's in the soul,
[1:25:40] it'll control. You bring it under you
[1:25:42] bring your spirit under obedience by
[1:25:44] choice, bringing it subject to the word,
[1:25:47] then you got to manifest him in flesh.
[1:25:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. Now,
[1:25:57] now I'm going to read Psalm 71.
[1:26:02] Well, you know what?
[1:26:07] Let's time to turn to Psalm 73.
[1:26:10] I may just have you go home and read
[1:26:12] Psalm 71.
[1:26:14] Psalm save save time here because it's
[1:26:16] going to take a little long because I
[1:26:17] was going to read the whole chapter and
[1:26:18] it's very good
[1:26:22] because Psalm 71, let me just read a
[1:26:24] couple verses of it. Psalm 71. In thee,
[1:26:26] O Lord, I do put my trust. Let me never
[1:26:29] be put to confusion. Deliver me in thy
[1:26:32] righteousness, and cause me to escape.
[1:26:34] Incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
[1:26:36] Be thou my strong habitation, wherein I
[1:26:40] may continually resort that thou has
[1:26:42] given com given commandment to save me.
[1:26:44] For thou art my rock and my fortress.
[1:26:53] All right. My mouth deliver me, oh Lord,
[1:26:56] out, oh God, out of the hand of the
[1:26:57] wicked, out of the hand of the
[1:26:58] unrighteous and cruel man. For thou art
[1:27:01] my hope, oh Lord God. Thou art my trust
[1:27:04] from my youth. And I want to make
[1:27:06] mention of that because I want something
[1:27:08] I got to read right at the end here. Now
[1:27:13] I think we'll stop right there. You can
[1:27:14] go back and read. You can read it
[1:27:17] further.
[1:27:18] Verse 9 said, "Cast me not off in the
[1:27:21] time of old age." Huh, David?
[1:27:24] Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
[1:27:26] Now, he knows what I'm talking about.
[1:27:29] Cuz we happen to be the same age.
[1:27:34] It's not a laughing matter.
[1:27:36] It's It's the truth.
[1:27:41] But thank God for strength, huh, Brother
[1:27:42] David, to keep moving. Keep on keeping
[1:27:45] on. We may,
[1:27:47] huh?
[1:27:48] I wouldn't have to bring that up, my
[1:27:50] brother.
[1:27:52] It's your birthday the 23rd.
[1:27:55] the 1st of March 21st. Okay. See, I'm
[1:27:58] the 12th
[1:28:00] of February. Not much older,
[1:28:02] but I am your elder.
[1:28:07] That means older in age, not a bishop or
[1:28:09] something over him. Just older in age.
[1:28:12] Okay.
[1:28:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:13] Yeah, that's right. All right.
[1:28:18] All right. Let my mouth be filled with
[1:28:20] thy praise and with thy honor all the
[1:28:22] day. Cast me not off in the time of old
[1:28:24] age. Forsake me not when my strength
[1:28:27] faileth.
[1:28:29] Amen.
[1:28:31] Psalm 73. You remember the song, thou
[1:28:33] the stream of all my comfort, more than
[1:28:35] life to me. Fanny Crosby wrote that.
[1:28:38] Thou the stream of all. That's always
[1:28:39] been a very tremendous verse to me. Thou
[1:28:42] the stream of all my comfort, more than
[1:28:44] life to me.
[1:28:46] Whom have I on earth beside thee?
[1:28:49] Brother Brandham at one point said,
[1:28:51] "What have I on earth beside thee?
[1:28:54] Or whom in heaven but thee?" You see,
[1:28:58] absolute
[1:29:01] in the flashing red light sign of his
[1:29:03] coming. Will you allow me just about
[1:29:04] three minutes to read this?
[1:29:07] No.
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:10] Okay, brother Paul, you got five more
[1:29:13] minutes.
[1:29:15] All right. No, I meant to read Psalm 73
[1:29:19] here. Just 23rd verse. Nevertheless, I'm
[1:29:21] continually with thee and h and hastened
[1:29:25] me by my right hand.
[1:29:28] Yeah.
[1:29:28] Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
[1:29:31] and afterward receive me to glory. Whom
[1:29:34] have I in heaven but thee? And there is
[1:29:36] none upon earth that I desire beside
[1:29:38] thee. My flesh and my heart faileth, but
[1:29:42] God is the strength of my heart and my
[1:29:45] portion forever.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:48] Amen. That's where that that's where
[1:29:50] that song that scripture was taken from.
[1:29:53] All right. In the flashing red light
[1:29:55] sign of his coming. I'm closing the
[1:29:58] Bible here. So, let me just read this. I
[1:30:00] don't know why it's a strange thing to
[1:30:03] read. I just felt to read it.
[1:30:07] He said, "Give me,
[1:30:10] give me
[1:30:12] grace to never complain." This paragraph
[1:30:16] 165 1- 167. I want my life, oh Lord. I
[1:30:21] want my people
[1:30:23] life. God grant that our life could be
[1:30:27] crowned.
[1:30:30] No matter if we suffer, whatever takes
[1:30:32] place, how many turns against me, I know
[1:30:36] this is one. I know this one thing in my
[1:30:38] life as I get older, my friends. The
[1:30:41] stream behind me will soon be running
[1:30:44] out narrower and narrower as I go down
[1:30:47] the road. And I know one thing, I'll
[1:30:50] have to it'll come to pass after a while
[1:30:52] that there will be nobody come to me and
[1:30:54] say, "Ask me advice."
[1:30:56] The ones who know me in my younger days
[1:30:59] will be gone on if I shall live. My
[1:31:02] friends will get fewer and fewer as I
[1:31:04] get older now. And I know that someday
[1:31:06] I've got to die. I hope that God never
[1:31:09] lets Satan crown me as an old crabid
[1:31:12] indifferent man and my wife an old
[1:31:14] nagging woman. Or your wife or your that
[1:31:17] way. I pray, brother, that our lives
[1:31:20] will be crowned with the fruits of the
[1:31:22] spirit. Love, joy, longsuffering,
[1:31:26] gentleness, patience, truth, faith in
[1:31:29] the Holy Spirit. My life thins out.
[1:31:32] About 35 years ago, I stood in the
[1:31:34] pulpit as a little boy. Tonight, I'm an
[1:31:38] old I'm old, gray in hair and
[1:31:41] bald-headed. Sounds familiar. Stooping
[1:31:44] shoulder.
[1:31:49] I'm broke down. My life is running out
[1:31:51] and my threads are getting brittle that
[1:31:53] I'm walking on. As I move on down the
[1:31:56] stream, my friends get fewer. And after
[1:31:58] a while, I'll come to a place maybe that
[1:32:00] I won't enjoy the songs like I used to.
[1:32:03] And maybe my grandchildren, the children
[1:32:05] will have to say, "Don't make grandpa
[1:32:08] nervous."
[1:32:10] It may come to that if I live. Then I'll
[1:32:12] come on down till I get up out of my
[1:32:15] chair. Then one morning the flag, excuse
[1:32:18] me, then it'll come down till I can't,
[1:32:21] excuse me, I get down to where I can't
[1:32:23] get out of my chair. Then one morning
[1:32:26] the fog will come into the room. I'll
[1:32:28] motion across the border to death to
[1:32:31] come and get me. He can only take me by
[1:32:34] the hand and lead me across to my
[1:32:36] master. He is not my slave driver. I am
[1:32:39] not his slave. He is my slave.
[1:32:43] Christ conquered death for me and only
[1:32:46] thing he can do is pull me into the
[1:32:47] presence of my maker. When this earthly
[1:32:50] tabernacle be dissolved for me to die is
[1:32:55] gain.
[1:32:56] Amen.
[1:32:57] Amen.
[1:32:57] Amen. Ephesians 6:13 and having in 14
[1:33:01] having done all to stand. There's a
[1:33:02] portion of the scripture having done all
[1:33:04] to stand therefore with the whole armor
[1:33:08] on. When you've done all the stands,
[1:33:11] stand therefore,
[1:33:13] holding forth the word of life.
[1:33:15] Philippians 23:16.
[1:33:17] Holding forth the word of life in every
[1:33:19] situation, in every circumstance, tests
[1:33:22] and trials. Hold forth the word of life.
[1:33:27] For me to live as Christ,
[1:33:30] to die is gain.
[1:33:32] That's a Christ centered life. Amen.
[1:33:35] Let's stand. God bless you. I went a
[1:33:38] little over time. Forgive me for that,
[1:33:40] brother Paul. I'll give you 15 minutes
[1:33:42] more.
[1:33:44] Take it gladly.
[1:33:47] Cuz many times he stopped and I said,
[1:33:49] "Oh,
[1:33:51] not yet.
[1:33:57] Follow the Lord. Follow the Lord." Who's
[1:34:01] your absolute?
[1:34:03] Who's our absolute? Amen.
[1:34:06] I believe that that little bride will
[1:34:08] come in such union with that. She's not
[1:34:11] trying to she don't have any business
[1:34:12] trying to declare herself.
[1:34:14] She's following the Lord.
[1:34:15] Do what he said do
[1:34:17] regardless of what others think. Take
[1:34:19] him at his word.
[1:34:23] Amen.
[1:34:25] Don't let nothing come between you and
[1:34:27] his word. Don't let nobody nobody
[1:34:30] nothing I don't care how dear they are.
[1:34:33] Don't you let it come between you and
[1:34:35] the word.
[1:34:38] Amen.
[1:34:43] For the bride, he told us, what do we
[1:34:46] what are we in in in a marriage reflects
[1:34:49] this? What is the bride? What she do?
[1:34:52] Lays her veil on his shoulders.
[1:34:54] Gives up everything she has and submits
[1:34:56] herself to her husband.
[1:35:00] Amen. regardless of whether I understand
[1:35:02] what he's doing or don't understand it,
[1:35:04] I'm submitted to him.
[1:35:07] And see, a marriage should be the same
[1:35:08] way because when we if we submit
[1:35:12] ourselves in everything,
[1:35:15] regardless if you don't think it's right
[1:35:17] or wrong,
[1:35:19] you may say, "Well, that's just
[1:35:20] absolutely unreasonable for our Lord to
[1:35:22] do a thing like that." Amen. That's our
[1:35:26] humanness. Well, I don't understand what
[1:35:29] he's doing. I don't understand. No, his
[1:35:31] thoughts are higher than your thoughts.
[1:35:33] His ways are higher than your ways.
[1:35:37] But when you surrender, Brother Brandham
[1:35:39] said this. He said, "Unless," now God
[1:35:42] didn't do this. A husband might. If he
[1:35:44] should say something, cause you to do
[1:35:45] something that's not according to word,
[1:35:47] he said, "Don't you do it.
[1:35:49] But when you serve him in every way, I
[1:35:51] don't care if you're the believer or an
[1:35:53] unbeliever,
[1:35:54] you're to serve him." And that's the
[1:35:56] bride and the groom.
[1:35:59] Amen. That's the bride and the groom.
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:04] That's it. Nothing comes between me and
[1:36:06] my husband.
[1:36:10] Amen. Nothing. Nothing. We are bound as
[1:36:13] one. Anything between breaks that union
[1:36:16] is not God.
[1:36:20] Amen. All right. Now, there's other
[1:36:23] things we could go on typing. I'd love
[1:36:26] to take that scripture in Ephesians and
[1:36:27] break it down spiritually.
[1:36:30] Paul said, "I speak concerning Christ
[1:36:32] and his bride."
[1:36:33] Yes.
[1:36:34] And what does a marriage do reflects
[1:36:36] that union
[1:36:38] natural marriage reflects that. What's
[1:36:41] the wife's position and what is the
[1:36:43] husband's position?
[1:36:46] Go to the scripture, find out.
[1:36:50] When I married, when I married the Lord,
[1:36:52] I put everything. We should be putting
[1:36:54] everything in his hands completely.
[1:36:58] Totally. You give up what you thought
[1:37:00] was right. You pour it off. You give it
[1:37:02] to him.
[1:37:05] If he makes a mistake, he answers it.
[1:37:10] That's right. I'm not responsible for
[1:37:12] him. He's responsible for me.
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:18] I want to sing that song on Christ the
[1:37:20] solid rock I stand.
[1:37:24] Are you willing to stand there?
[1:37:27] Is he a solid rock?
[1:37:29] Yes.
[1:37:29] Is he the re is he your revelation?
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:36] My hope is built on nothing less than
[1:37:42] Jesus blood and righteousness.
[1:37:46] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[1:37:52] holy lean on Jesus name.
[1:37:58] On Christ the solid
[1:38:01] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:38:06] sinking sand.
[1:38:09] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:38:14] When darkness seemed to hide his face, I
[1:38:20] rest on his unchanging grace. In every
[1:38:26] high and stormy gale my anchor holds
[1:38:32] with. In the veil
[1:38:36] on Christ the solid
[1:38:39] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:38:44] sinking sand.
[1:38:46] All other ground is sinking sand. His
[1:38:53] oath, his covenant,
[1:38:56] lent his blood. That should be enough.
[1:39:00] He promised whelming flood when all
[1:39:05] around my soul gives way. He then is all
[1:39:11] my hope and stay.
[1:39:14] On Christ the solid
[1:39:18] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:39:23] sinking sand.
[1:39:27] Ground is sinking sand.
[1:39:32] When now brother sister
[1:39:35] we've already heard the sound of the
[1:39:37] trumpet.
[1:39:41] Amen. And we're in the coming as
[1:39:44] rightuousness
[1:39:46] alone. Faultless to stand before the
[1:39:51] throne.
[1:39:53] On Christ the solid
[1:39:56] rock I stand. All other ground is
[1:40:01] sinking sand.
[1:40:04] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:40:10] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] Amen. There's another song beside Give
[1:40:17] Me the Word. We could sing that again,
[1:40:19] but there's another one.
[1:40:27] I can't think of it.
[1:40:29] Well, let's just sing that again. I
[1:40:32] Brother Alex, could you come up and lead
[1:40:34] this song? I I can't really sing it
[1:40:37] properly, but I love it. So I can sing
[1:40:41] it if somebody else sings it.
[1:40:44] Amen.
[1:40:47] I can get the tempo of it.
[1:40:50] Go ahead, brother.
[1:40:54] It's been tested. It's been tried.
[1:40:59] Search and find your satisfied.
[1:41:03] Though the story's old, the message
[1:41:06] still is true.
[1:41:11] It's been ridiculed. It's been chained.
[1:41:15] Still its powers never change.
[1:41:19] It will stand the test forever. Give me
[1:41:23] the word.
[1:41:26] Give me the word.
[1:41:30] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[1:41:34] the word.
[1:41:38] It's the light that I might see. Give me
[1:41:42] the word.
[1:41:46] It's my total victory
[1:41:50] over every situation.
[1:41:53] Give me the word.
[1:41:57] Oh, I don't want it watered down,
[1:42:01] sugarcoated, or profound.
[1:42:05] Give me basic truths that last the
[1:42:08] course of time.
[1:42:13] And preach it strong and preach it clear
[1:42:17] so that all the world can hear.
[1:42:21] It will change your lives forever. Give
[1:42:24] me the word.
[1:42:27] Oh, give me the word.
[1:42:32] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[1:42:36] the word.
[1:42:40] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[1:42:44] the word.
[1:42:48] It's my total victory
[1:42:51] over every situation.
[1:42:55] Give me the word.
[1:42:58] Oh, give me the word.
[1:43:03] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[1:43:07] the word.
[1:43:10] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[1:43:14] the word.
[1:43:18] It's my total victory
[1:43:22] over every situation.
[1:43:25] Give me the word.
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:30] Amen.
[1:43:31] Maybe before we dismiss, we'll sing
[1:43:34] number 491, manifesting time.
[1:43:42] The voice of my beloved.
[1:43:46] Behold, he quickly comes.
[1:43:49] Sweeping over the mountains, over the
[1:43:52] hills he runs.
[1:43:56] I long to hear his voice. I long to hear
[1:44:02] him say, "Arise, my love, my fair one.
[1:44:07] Come away."
[1:44:11] It's manifesting
[1:44:13] time. The fruits are on the vine and the
[1:44:18] lovely one is coming in plain view.
[1:44:24] Oh to cap God's chosen bride.
[1:44:29] Redemption straw at night. He's that
[1:44:33] lovely one. He's coming in plain view.
[1:44:39] The grapes are yours and mine.
[1:44:43] Little foxes spoil the vine, for the
[1:44:47] vineyards blossom for their harvest
[1:44:50] time.
[1:44:53] Keep your eyes on things above.
[1:44:57] Don't look at me or you see that lovely
[1:45:01] one. He's coming in plain view.
[1:45:07] Oh, it's manifesting
[1:45:09] time. The fruits are on the vine and the
[1:45:14] lovely one is coming in plain view.
[1:45:21] Oh, to cap God's chosen bride.
[1:45:25] Redemption draw it nigh. He's that
[1:45:29] lovely one. is coming in plain view.
[1:45:35] In the cliff of the rock, in the secret
[1:45:40] place so high, till the day breaks and
[1:45:44] the shadows flee away
[1:45:50] in that mountain place, a sweet smells
