on their little holiday together and uh lord just be with them i was just thinking about my brother tim the unfortunate circumstances in this life of of having to work and the the hours the time so just remember brother tim in prayer and brother david sister diane their daughter sarah and grandson andrew were in town and they had mentioned that they were probably going up to visit the smiths and so i believe that's probably where they're at tonight so um we just want to keep them in prayer i just want you to uh without going through and naming a lot of names that we don't know but um there is just a tremendous amount of saints around the world that are passing and you hear some comments and people are they're talking about covid and talking about these things but uh actually not connected you know we'll touch on some things tonight lord willing that actually these thoughts never uh what would you say moved us to study in this vein it's just kind of a connection that is there but just remember them just i know it might kind of sound generic but just to remember those families and those churches brother mike olteg uh is in surgery in recovery right now uh his little church uh there in augusta um uh out on the on the coast there uh beach island um and uh you know so tonight their pastors you know in the hospital uh uh expected to make recovery right but certainly kind of scary when when you know you just come to a stage that uh your body cannot support itself so let's just remember that and uh i also oh my let's remember uh sister carl ruffino um and uh so yes definitely the lord would just touch her come on this scene amen so you know many many things and uh so uh just i think it's a time saints as uh as uh the word of god has taught us prophet reiterated that it is a time for us to just make sure that we put everything in order and we're faithful to lift one another up before the lord amen so i want to also announce that the youth meetings as far as i know and grace kids are still taking place friday 7 00 p.m at their respective houses and uh so let's just stand and go into the word i want to talk to you just taking something out of my studies here for this title the key that unlocked and as we look at that and we just recognize that god has given us a key it's not a key for us just to talk about not just something for us to turn into a vocabulary but god intended for it to be real it attended uh intended for us to um you know be something uh that we uh could apply in our life and have faith and confidence that that when we apply it it will come to pass and god will hear us so let's turn in our bibles to revelations the first chapter we'll look here and see tonight uh what it is that um the the spirit coming down upon john and my brother and sister when we read this i want you to read this that even though as it were in the flesh we were not there when the spirit come down upon john but that same spirit wants to come down on us in the very self-same fashion god is not i'm doing a mighty work over here and then i want you to sit back and just observe it he wants it to become something so real to us that that we're not here talking about it and we'll we'll hit on these things so i don't want to get ahead of myself but we've got to break and i'm not saying that you here tonight or whoever might be listening uh are subject to this but i believe many people are and that is we've got to break the historical figure of jesus christ in our life if he is history then he is not alive to us amen i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha now we know there's only one voice can say this right amen this is not just a servant this is not just an angel this has to be god almighty the lord jesus christ i'm alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia and to ephesus and to smyrna pergamus and thyatira under sardis philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength in other words he's saying i really couldn't look at him the sun shineth so bright you can't just stare at it and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which shall have seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which i'll sauced in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars or the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thouse are the seven churches heavenly father we just thank you tonight we come before you just ask your father bless our time together as we look in your word father it's my heart's desire that the word would be open to us once again in such a fashion lord greater than ever before lord let it be your revelation coming to your people that would stir hearts lord to see the age that we're living in see the open book lord the open word that is before us father to become partakers of that we thank you for your grace your mercy tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we would look at this tonight i want to just kind of start off sharing with you this thought and that is that the word always identifies itself and even standing there in the days before all the sadducees and pharisees our lord jesus christ was there if if they had um really viewed it if they had not come and and the word prejudiced is such a uh used word in this day that uh you know if if something does not satisfy them then there's some kind of prejudice but let's get down to the real prejudice that really matters and that is that the denominational spirit or the spirit of the religious world is prejudiced against the gospel they do not really like the word because the word in and of itself without even as it were a a group of people but just the word itself actually rebukes them and uh in that realm as they are they're setting uh uh they can uh look at the word if if they had revelation let me just uh put that in there because you see the word always identifies it when jesus come there was an identification that declared that a messiah was coming and it was unfortunately by the prejudice of the religious movements that they determine the criteria by which the messiah must come how he must represent himself and who he would come to oh my brother and sister what what a what a situation when when one would be so determined that god's just going to come through this or through this or in this fashion and so it is there that we would find and now look i know this kind of probably comes across as offensive to some people but i i really believe this with all of my heart that if brother branham was coming back and people are like oh my i've heard people talk about this uh there'll be no room people will be flying from all over the world well what about that poor family in the heart of africa that just survives from day to day but they believe the word they're not going down and getting a ticket and flying to to the united states to attend a meeting but you know let's just for the sake of conversation say it would be possible i think by the second or third day there would be plenty of empty seats because by prejudice just as it was with our lord jesus christ in that day and not trying to put brother branham and jesus christ in that same context but it'll be there and after people hear and their hide gets tore off he's not going to sit down and say i think i need to pamper these people i need their tithe i need their attendance i need no he would he would just lay it right on there i think they'll be saying this is not my prophet this is not my prophet's a gentleman and he loves me he does he loves you so much he tells you the truth but you see the prejudice has it coming in such a fashion just as the same prejudice sister jerry has set through these type of things in south america my brother and sister the same atmosphere is created and people don't believe that they are actually feeding on the word of god or receiving a blessing unless they literally are running up and down the aisles screaming so loud that no one can hear the minister and so you see those kind of kind of things you know and it's a mindset that is there it's a a a preconceived idea and so the word has come and the word in every generation has identified itself and it's identified in and of itself right so you want to look the prophet of god tells us very clearly you want to find the day that you are living in then search the scripture because the scripture will identify the day we are living in so we can find what is happening in the word and so as the word is always identifies itself uh they you know they ask jesus uh uh you know are you the messiah you know are you the messiah he didn't say to them the unbeliever i am the messiah he said to them you say that i am see it was in their own vocabulary they had already admitted that he was the messiah because when the messiah comes these are the things he will do so they acknowledge that he was doing the things that the word said the messiah would do but the messiah oh can i just speak regular words here he slapped them silly he told them your system your hierarchy your spirit is all wrong and they didn't like that instead of repenting and saying oh lord help us they said no sir he has broken what we have declared will be when the messiah comes but when the messiah my brother and sister come as he says there jesus said if you had believed moses you would believe me because he spoke of me so he was identified in the very word that moses had brought and they there recognized moses as a prophet but jesus goes on to say because you did not believe moses right you acknowledged said let's not let's not get too bashful tonight they said amen to moses message while they didn't obey it lord help us to fall under that spirit lord let us come to the place when we say amen to the word that we really mean so be it amen so the same word will bring the same results do we believe that amen so we don't have to come up with a new message for our day amen so we can say very clearly jesus christ identified in the word amen just as he was then he is in the day that we're living in now let's look in this message here identified christ of all ages brother brown says so many people have different opinions of christ as i travel in different parts of the country and around the world i find that so many people have their different opinions you'd be surprised to know what some of their opinions are some of them think that he's just a wonderful teacher well now he was he was that not just exactly and many thinks he was a great philosopher which he was that he certainly he was and then some of them think that he was a good man he he was that but see he was more than that he was all of that plus some of them think that he was a prophet and he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was what the prophets was plus see so what how would we know now if he was teaching of his teaching he was a teacher and he was a great philosopher so he was fulfilling see and i hope you catch the the kind of i'm going to say the undertone of what i'm saying here they were saying these things about jesus christ and all that they were saying was true but they never took it to its fruition they never took the fullness of it to receive the true blessing of all that it was they were just declaring their part now brother branham here has tied all of these different sayings that they're saying even islam recognizing him as a good man and declares he's a prophet they just believe muhammad is the prophet see so all of that what brother brown teach us many others have reiterated through the words but hey brother branham said all of these things have an element of truth think about that so it's there he says but the only way we'll ever know today if we wanted to identify him today and i believe that he's raised from the dead i believe that with all my heart and i believe that he's promised here that he is the same yesterday today and forever and i'm with thee always and i'll never leave me nor forsake thee i'll just say can we say amen to that that's what we believe with all of our hearts amen now those words are they're either true or they're not true so now we have a vocabulary that's really not any different than say if we were jehovah witness or whatever else right all of these different ideologies if we call it that have a a basis of truth they have their factual they have their message so just by a declaration of saying oh the message well that doesn't put us on the right track my brother and sister because they all have a message so it comes down see that we have to come back to the word and we have to come and take a position that is sustainable see we can i i won't go into this some of you wouldn't even know the name it doesn't matter but you know you can have something you can gather gathering around yourself you can have the sensational you can have all of this stuff but if it's not a true move of god it will burn out it will fail right the scripture says hey were they not of these and went into the wilderness and were they not of these and it come to not see all of that's going to happen my brother and sister because it's only the true word of god that will survive right through to the end otherwise there's every perversion now i don't know if you caught this in the news but now we have uh the three great leaders of orthodox basically catholicism by different terms they have come together signed a proclamation now that uh humans on the earth that love the earth need to gather together now to save mother earth well i read my bible and it says they'll love the creation more than the creator but people respond to that yes we live on this earth and and we need to we need to do something now we need to uh oh they said sacrifice we need to sacrifice well i would like them to sacrifice along with me right i think that's reasonable but you see what the spirit is the spirit is not there you don't see the three principle leaders of the greatest segment of what they term as christianity coming together saying we need a holy ghost move in this land because the end of time is coming you need to repent or you're going to perish no no we're fulfilling scripture so now we want to focus the world now on this great move to save the earth just so god can burn it they don't believe that part is what it actually comes down to they don't believe that part so and those words are they're either true or they're not and if they're not true see i love how brother branham puts this out i i mean one thing i'll say about brother branham it's it's not just a a uh you know cut and dried thing to me i i love how he's willing to speak you might say on the negative context not too many people really like to introduce that we got to keep you happy by just preaching all the nice things but look what brother brown says here now those words are either true or they're not and if they're not true then what we are doing what then what are we doing here tonight we are we are wretched people we're people that's well we are deceived the whole christian world is deceived if he isn't the same yesterday today and forever if he isn't alive tonight and with us as he promised low i am with you always even to the consummation or into the world i'm with you always now if that isn't the truth then there is something wrong and we are found false witnesses not only are we making ourselves miserable under a false pretense but we are deceiving others so he cuts it right to the chase and there'll be those that say absolutely right that's what that was that's what this message of the hour that's what this is all this is but my brother and sister remember there was always two spirits in the framework of the church and there was always oh there was always a twin when they got raised up in egypt in goshen and they left you would think every one of those people that was leaving egypt would have been a uh uh god fearing praying desiring for deliverance but when they left goshen there was a twin there was another segment another remnant that left out of there and they were the ones that the spirit in the midst of the people they were the ones that were right there saying oh you know what you've led us out here to kill us in the wilderness you you deceived us you brought us out here to die we wish we were back in egypt when we left with you we were just looking for something novel we were looking for something different we were looking for some kind of freedom from do it to do whatever we want but you've brought us out here see they became the twin to the movement and we'd say all those terrible people but some of them was the preachers come on we we get out here and and uh you know i mean i'm sure nobody thought abiram was a bad guy nobody thought my brother and sister that that person they were sitting in fellowship with was trying to lead them astray in fact the spirit of the day brings it in such a way that light was cast that it was actually moses that is the problem not these ministries it's his fault but we have to stop and take a parallel in the scripture who did god cleave the earth and swallow moses had his mistakes don't you love how god brings these same parallels come down you can find moses mistakes but they were pretty open you don't find out you know three thousand later years later we discovered moses's you know hidden things no god just made it right out in the open we have a prophet that turns around says i lied i have a prophet that says he this and says this and it's all right on tape and and uh you and we'll touch on that in a minute don't let me get this side strike somebody's telling me just keep focused amen so what are we doing see if that isn't the truth there's something wrong and we are found as fault with false witnesses not only are we making ourselves miserable under a false pretense but we are deceiving others so as you look at this now uh it's pretty straightforward we're found deceivers of something we're talking about which isn't if he's just a myth if god's just a myth but the prophet of god took this a step further saints and this is why i made that early statement that i made to you see brother branham comes along and ties this if he's just a myth if there is no god if this whole thing called christianity is just a false fake thing that's just horrible and we're just deceiving ourselves but look what he tags on the back of that can somebody tell me if he's his historical god we're the same position as if he's a myth if we put him as a historical god heaven help us my brother and sister we want the power and demonstration of the holy ghost in our midst we don't want a historical story of jesus christ and the the holy ghost falling on the people on the day of pentecost is some kind of historical thing and people are like well we're looking for tongues of fire to come licking through the church and to do this and to do that but did you know my brother and sister we have had many a service here where tongues of fire have moved in our midst because that tongue of fire is the holy ghost and as he comes down and deals with hearts brings repentance brings revelation changes lives my brother and sister just because we don't see it with our eyes now many years ago when we were in the other church we had a couple that was visiting us and and they were so excited right in the in the service they got so excited and they they were just so they just couldn't wait to tell us and after church they're like brother paul we were sitting there and we saw licks of fire moving across the platform and it'd be easy to say you know what i i think they're hallucinating right go on saints are you with me nobody felt a great shiver nobody but you see i'm not going to doubt that couple god was speaking to them and truly he was because after the fact we got to know them a little bit they shared things and how that little words you might say words of wisdom words of knowledge was put down into their life answers to things in their life and to them they say i saw a licks of fire on the platform that's good my brother and sister we'll never doubt that because we know that the holy ghost is promised to be here right he said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in the midst of you and right there in revelation 1 says that he was a fire but you see we get so focused in what our idea of the day of pentecost must have looked like and we try to duplicate that without actually duplicating that which means to get what they got we have to get to where they were at and that is not to go search the streets until we find that building and climb the steps it's for us to get in a place we are so desperate to be in the presence of god that we sacrifice everything else to be in his presence you know that's a hard thing in the day let's just let's let the rubber hit the road it's a hard thing to do in our day my brother and sister satan's very very adept brother jason walked i hope you don't mind me saying this brother jason but brother jason walked in the office and i said how are you tonight brother and he goes the devil knew it was church tonight and that's the truth that's the truth see so then he just he has every little malfunction that he can throw every little thing in the road every little stumbling stone in every little circumstance what good is a historical christ if he isn't the same today well good as a god of moses if he isn't the same god today what good does it do to take your canary bird and feed him fine vitamins to make him have pretty feathers and good strong wings then keep him in a cage see it doesn't do him any good we talk about how great god was and then don't say he's the same today see that's why we should have a strong positive confession about these things he's my healer he's my provider you can fill in the blank we should take the position even if you don't oh do any of you go by feelings go ahead raise your hands we go by feelings i didn't feel like preaching tonight but everybody else has deserted us that made me feel even worse no that isn't we can't go by feelings because if we were going by feelings we would all be home right now with the sheep pulled over our head woe is me but we couldn't say he's forsaken us because his word says i'll never forsake you so we're not liars so we can't actually carry even the devil's message out to its completion because there's something inside of us that can't say something contrary to the word so even when the devil's trying to make you feel like nobody loves you nobody cares nobody this nobody this no no you can't go there because jesus christ himself god himself said i will never leave you nor forsake you so we cannot say there in all honesty god's forsaken me why because there's something inside you that says i can't speak contrary to the word amen we're caged up let's see we talk about how great god was and they don't say he's the same today then there's something wrong we're caged up somewhere and that's that's a false conception of what god is the bible plainly says he's the same can we say that together he's the same and that means he's the same and he's just as he was he hasn't changed one bit and he's the same yesterday today and forever can someone say amen to that hallelujah now as we look at this and we just recognize my brother and sister if he's just a myth or historical god then we literally will come to a place in our life as we have seen others not judging them just stating facts we have seen others come to a place that they no longer trust god those who used to cry in the presence of god stand before you today and say i don't even believe there's a god you see what happened god got moved from being real to them satan blurred the image and he come down and he then became historical historical god first which means he did that a long time ago but he doesn't do that anymore and then as faith ebbs we move from he doesn't do that anymore to there is no god and we know young men that have done that i'm thinking names and i won't name them but i've seen young men make that i've seen them been right there before when it's crying out to the lord and then a few short years and circumstances come and they'll tell you there's no such thing as a god we live once we die we're ashes dust gone see how it works satan knows because you see he's got to someone who's been in the presence of god he's got to move he doesn't just take him from serving god to a myth they've got to take him through this pattern and turn him into a historical god that's history that's long ago that happens oftentimes when people are looking for the spirit of the age which is uh um we want instant gratification in other words i'll get down on my knees tonight and i will pray and i expect an answer tomorrow but what happened when we pray sometimes day to week months heaven forbid years for an answer do we have faith enough to hang on is this historical god historical enough to just keep on keeping on or will we just let it become a myth i prayed he was angry with me he never answered my prayers it is strange i don't know if you've ever had this happen but sometimes god will answer a prayer in such a fashion that we literally have to stumble over the fact that he's answered it god's already come on the scene and because no lights lit up and the bank didn't call and say somebody's just deposited a million dollars in your checking account we we don't think god's answered our prayer only to find out down the road when i say stumble on it as we go down the road all of a sudden you know how good hindsight is do any of you know how good hindsight is hindsight is so good somebody said it's 20 20. but i've heard another guy say it's absolutely 2010 because it is so accurate you can look back and see and imagine how you feel i know this firsthand a firsthand experience you look back amen when i wasn't serving god i used to put all kinds of things before the lord and you know sometimes you you just throw little things out there and its insincerity saints but it's really not correct according to the word but then god goes ahead and answers that anyhow i'll just give you a brief story i i was just really struggling i i would i would i would you know say i'm i'm going to serve the lord i'm going to serve the lord and then things would happen and i would slip back from that i was antelope hunting up in the pacima roy out chalice country and and going through just a really low spot in my life and uh i'm up there hunting and and uh was said you come up here and i know where the antelope are and i'll i'll help you and i got up there and he basically said i'm too busy doing what i'm doing to help you just go off and do your own thing and so i was a little discouraged from that and and you know i was out there and i'd walked miles i'd done that i sweated i crawled through the cactus i've done all these kind of things and i was out there and i just said lord if you love me you talk about now such a despicable irresponsible should have been slapped silly kind of prayer lord if you love me you'll give me an handle now if our children stood in front of us and said mom and dad if you really love me you would let me drink all the pop i want we'd say i i really love you you're not going to drink any pot that's more the human response right but you know what god did the very next day the lord gives me an antelope and i was so excited about shooting a nice antelope i call him different names i've called him everything from fred to edward or whatever but uh he's still hanging in the house there you know and uh did i stop and thank god for that can any of you guessed the answer you see my approach was so vain god come in such a fashion he answered the prayer everything was done according in 24 hours and it took time for me to wake up one day looking back and say you know what the lord gave me that antelope and i never even said thank you you see god's good because instead of condemning me for that he stirred my heart chastised me and even though as quite a ways down the road i looked back and i said lord forgive me but thank you because even something like that now you say brother paul that's wonderful you got an answer in 24 hours my brother and sister you'd be surprised how many answers god gives us that we're so caught up in our self we don't even acknowledge i don't know why i'm even talking about that now look brother branham says here the last of this quote there must be excuse me let me finish and now we have today in this day and this time just like we did in his day in old days we have our own thought of it but surely if there is any way in the world that we could truly know we'd have to find out what he was and then find out what he was in other ages remember the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever so we'll have to find out what he is out of other ages to know what he was in the age that he walked on earth the age before he walked on earth and the age after he was on earth and left the earth and we'll have to find out what he was to know what he is today so now you know the prophet of god i read that quote to you and maybe you won't remember it uh but brother branham was declaring he said you have to search out you have to you have to search out you can't just sit back you have to search out and so this is kind of the thought train that i was following see as you have to know what he is today always because he's the same yesterday today and forever now but in otherwise we'll have to go back and search out to see whatever he was so we can't just take a superficial that well he's the same yesterday today and forever okay do we really know what he was we really studied and prayed about it and and come imagine the woman with the blood issue i have to believe with all my heart that she had prayed a lot of prayers but there was something stirred in her that she got up another day of her life maybe now she's bankrupt maybe now she's weak because she has this this issue but she's prayed another prayer and she proceeds to go because she believes there's an answer so she didn't sit back and say i'm giving up she still pursued it with every bit of energy and life that was within her so see we got to go back and search out to see whatever he was and i just want to take this now you see my brother and sister the key is executing the correct kind of search now we live in a world where things are on the internet right so you can just uh you can say well i'm gonna search something out well just go ahead type william branham see that's not really who the message is to you and i is it it's not really he's he's a messenger to the day but he is not our message our message is jesus christ but you type in william branham and you will find all kinds of information all the way from encouraging to discouraging and you will find testimonies of people that were believing till they look and now they can't believe to those that something in their heart says i don't care what this garbage is i'm gonna believe there's something speaking to me maybe i'm the one with the blood issue maybe i'm the one at the well and it's not about what research or those around me have said but it's about what god is dealing with in my own heart and so you know you you start to uh search and and the problem is my brother and sister is often times humans they go and they start to search this one's writings and they go and search this one's writings and and you know they're trying to find uh information when the true search should be us sighing and crying for god in our life it should be us hungering and thirsting for righteousness it should not be the opinion of this man or the opinion of that man because you see they're in their own prejudiced state now you can take this and no doubt you have read this but my brother and sister if you want to search things out of opinions go type in the words of david harrell and you will find that many a person writing in the world we live in today writing of whether william branham's ministry was of god or not they quote david harrell but does david harrell have it right see david harrell says that william branham was a man of god but went off in the end so if you are looking to david harrell's writings you're going to go oh my started this great movement started this supernatural recognized by all these ministries oh it's a cult and he went off in the end oh i'm away from that but let's go search where do we search do we go over here now pardon me for using these words but we go over here to somebody that's practically worshipping brother branham and ask them no you're not going to get the correct answer from them either what we've got to do is search the scriptures is what the scripture says search the scripture amen get into the spirit and pray about these things and god said i'll answer you amen so you see it's just because someone's been used as a point of reference for many writings doesn't mean what they have declared is correct scare yourself go see what wikipedia says now i want you as you type in wikipedia to compare what wikipedia says against your own personal experience with god and you'll find that all of this stuff about wikipedia in wikipedia and all of these references my brother and sister i just read i just read these things as part of my study i'm not necessarily encouraging you to do that but i read this and i thought i wouldn't follow that message either that's something i hope you see the humor of this i'm reading wikipedia and i'm like i wouldn't follow that but you see it's not a true reference of what it really is and now i want you to take this and get away from all these negative things but i want you to take this right back our lord jesus is walking on the earth and some scholars over here and he taps into wikipedia it's got a hot spot and he taps into that and he's reading about this man called jesus christ and determines it's got to be be elizabeth this does not fit what we are looking for so their point of reference no longer become the word of god it become something as it would be referenced wikipedia and i couldn't follow something like that so they shut their mind off and they walk away forgetting now i'm talking about true experiences of people i've dealt with forgetting what god had already done for them they have forgot the things of god that has already happened in their life prayers answered discernment of spirits and words of knowledge that have come but because of these points of reference they they just walk away but you see my brother and sister what happens and you say brother paul you're making a lot of effort upon this i want you to see my brother and sister what we've got to do even taking this from this quote now but in other words we have to go back and search it out to see whatever he was now if he's the same yesterday today and forever we could be that woman at the well and if we are a daughter of god as it were the bride of christ he will come down and he will discern the issue in our life and he will speak to it and we'll know this is the messiah we won't have to question we won't need to go on the bible answer man we won't have to write to some deal over here or go find a theologian about which form of the the hebrew that we need to follow just write a very interesting article there's now a controversy between the five main dialects of hebrew and they're arguing about what these scriptures mean over whether it's this one this one this one this and so that's wonderful that's good while they're doing that i want to search out the holy spirit i want the power of almighty god to come down in our midst in a real form in a real way amen not a theological not an argument but the reality of jesus christ amen because you see if we're going to go search out all these opinions and we're going to search all these ideologies why don't we just go ask the devil what he thinks of the holy ghost imagine the answer we're going to get unnecessary way off on a limb not not real never happened you don't need it just go to church well he knows that you're religious so he's not going to tell you not to go to church because he knows you're going to back up from that but he's just going to water it so down it's like just sign your name no come on we search it out what's what's the word say huh amen now let's look here hope you don't mind to my uh tonight i just you know i just kind of more i don't know what you'd call it teaching i just want you to look at this you know stir your minds up now the revelation book of symbols brother brahm says jesus watch three things which was which is and which is to come the same yesterday today and forever a little later on in the scripture the next chapter he said out of the same chapter he said i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore so he is clearly identifying himself you know isn't it amazing when we talk about a near kinsman redeemer now to me it was a great revelation when i my eyes were open and i saw that and you know here's boaz acknowledging to the world there is one nearer than i but i want this girl to be my wife so much then i'm willing to go out in public at the risk that this near kinsman would say that girl's beautiful if i redeem her i redeem naomi i get this field and that field and this thing and that thing and i get all of this i just have to make a room for naomi in the house and you know put up with the old lady for a while and sorry for putting it that way boaz says it's worth the risk but look at that very key response of that near kinsman redeemer lest i would mar my testimony what was the testimony the devil knows that resurrection life is real he just didn't have a revelation of whether it applied to him or not there's no way he's going to lay his life down imagine if on television as it were the devil said i'm going to prove to you guys once and for all and then he's just gone see he's not going to take that chance and that revelation of the near kinsman redeemer shows that our lord jesus christ as a boaz was able to take that and signify and say whatever it takes to redeem her i'm willing to pay that price oh i tell you i remember as just kind of a on off believer uh you know how it just struck me one day i thought there it is the confidence of jesus christ was that he's gonna redeem me that he laid his life down without a squall or a squabble or anything like that because he knew hallelujah that the word would come to pass and he would rise again oh my i tell you it just stirs my heart and i hope it serves yours the same way as i was alive again forevermore i have the keys not some church or peter or his cathedral at rome or an episcopalian or whatever it is got a key that's the key to fellowship see there's a problem my brother and sister is even happening around this message is people are more worried about having a key of fellowship we we are churches associated with this group and and this ministry identifies with us and our pastor is friends with who come on that's not what it's about saints that's not what it's about it's us having a relationship with jesus christ and brother ram says here see that's all just a key to fellowship but i have speaking as it would jesus christ i have the keys of death and hell amen oh don't you love him today he has the key to your joy he has the key to your happiness he has the key of your deliverance from the grave i have the key of death and hell hades i can unlock the supernatural hallelujah you want to see some supernatural saints we need to just get in the presence of god and let him unlock the supernatural we ought not sit back and say well until i see god do this and that in our church i'm just going to sit here and wonder if this is a real holy ghost no no you're the hindrance you're the hindrance become the attraction of the holy ghost amen i can unlock the supernatural i can unlock the natural i got the key of death and hell here in my hand oh there is a fountain open come take the waters of life freely oh isn't that beautiful oh so we're looking at this and realizing now that this key is not just my brother and sister this is not just a key of eternal life it is a key to be applied right here in this life day by day you can be like paul and be on a ditch bank and lord i have no friends woe unto paul and then have the lord show you this hmm forgive me lord it isn't about this see i'm looking for joy happiness friendship come on i'm kind of speaking in that third person realm so y'all i mean if i've pointed at you it wouldn't be polite right i'm trying to break that habit but you see we we got to realize that this key he's got the key he's got the key he's got the key we're not going to find the key in ourself until we find him then we have the key amen oh i hope you guys are getting this now so we look at this excuse me where i am did we forget something alex i i don't see the siege help possess the gate of his enemy um excuse me on that we'll just go ahead don't worry about it so in the seed shall possess the gate of his enemy brother branham says this joshua didn't think how wide jordan was or how muddy it was said gather yourselves together and sanctify yourself and take the ark of god and go forward and he possessed the gate of the enemy why because he was taking a promised people to a promised land by a promise of god isn't that beautiful a promised people to a promised land by a promise of god amen and was the children of abraham that makes a baptist feel like shouting abraham seed still possessed the gate of the enemy yet he crossed over the jordan we got to come to the jordans too sometimes all these great warriors had to die because they were born in sin born by sexual desire shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies but being the promise being abraham's seed by the promise that god gave abraham they subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness and stopped the mouth of lions and escaped the edge of the sword and move back the waters and raise the dead for they were the seed of abraham by a promise by god himself and he would do for them oh that ought to make us shout like a baptist amen then finally one day come the royal seed not borned of a man but conceived in the womb of a virgin by god himself with no sexual desire holy spirit born and when the holy ghost overshadowed a little virgin and conceived in there the true seed of abraham look at this in the spiritual type saints the faith that abraham had in god god made a promise of this seed born to virgin birth then he had power over all the gates of the enemy come on let's get this over in the spiritual realm and look what it is to you my brother sister i'm telling you right now sorry brother trevor sister carrie but no man ever come and instilled the faith in the word of god in you it was god himself he planted the seed he watered the seed he shone the sun upon that seed and birthed it and that's why a real true son or daughter of god no man on this earth can ever take that from them that's why as it is the stories we're hearing his people will not deny him we're thinking that's a different day it is not a different day it is this day and god is bringing it to pass and raising it up that we can have young children so filled with god they will not deny him oh but that's over there in them countries where they don't have much and they this that well praise the lord what they do have is faith maybe maybe we need a little less comfort and a little more of the lord amen see when he was on earth he had the gates of sickness in his own power he spoke to the sick and the gates opened up and they walked out free he had the keys to the gate of leprosy of affliction of temptations they smacked him on the face and done everything by pulling his beard uh uh from his face and spinning upon him and trying to get him to do something that was wrong he said i could speak to my father and straight away he'd send me 12 legions of angels he could do it but he had the power why he had to taste death you imagine can you even imagine what it'd be like i'm sorry i don't mean to insert myself into this but i have caused grievous injury to my own body and lived with the consequence of grievous injury and there's something in the back of my mind saints that says in the flesh in other words jesus christ that man of flesh the pain he felt it would have taken something supernatural to have said release me from this and imagine all those people who thought all them soldiers and all that crowd that thought they were so powerful and so in control would have been like if jesus had called those angels upon them it would have been a great slaughter but he bore that within himself because he says and i'm going to just bring it down to us i've got a bride in laodicea that needs to have a key that will deliver her in their day and i am going to give them that key i will not make it just figurative of writing i will not make it a myth or make it history i will make it so real that they will know they can take that key and they can put it into faith and release it and overcome such a wicked day see he's there he knows my brother and sister he can unlock the supernatural unlock the natural whatever is necessary it's right there he can do that and he said i'm going to do it for them oh isn't that beautiful i tell you it stirs my heart amen he had to taste death all these other warriors had done victories and so forth but he had to conquer that one who could not be conquered by these men think about all of the men through this scripture and great warriors that fought for god and overcome enemies and not one of them could go no matter how great they was and overcome death not one of them could take that oh my when they killed him on calvary his soul ascended into hell and i hope you don't mind because i find great joy in this and he turned the keys on hell down there and unlocked the place and took over i'm sorry i just there's something inside me just bubbles up i can see them walk down amongst them devils and they're there and there's the devil standing there saying how we got you and he reached out snatched those keys off of him and goes over there and unlocks death hell in the grave and the devil's saying whoa whoa whoa whoa you can't do that and he said oh yes i can you know who i am you know the authority i have and you know i am the word coming forth in power and majesty and the devil said no no no if you do that my whole plan is messed up you imagine i'm not trying to speak for god or add words to the word but i can see jesus christ just telling them i'm sorry your plan was your plan this plan is my plan and my plan will succeed hallelujah aren't you glad god's got a plan for you and i amen just as sure as we like to cut hair uh uh weld up cut up metal or whatever it is that we like to do program things and whatever just as much as god made us in the natural that way he made this plan that you and i would be attracted to that i like dirt i like the smell of dirt i like all of these things pertaining as a word of the natural to dirt my brother and sister but there's something that's greater than any natural attraction i have and that is my attraction to the word and if i was no longer i got up in the morning i was no longer a farmer i i would say so be it my brother and sister if i got up in the morning and something was there to stop me from serving god i would say lord take me come quickly lord but we don't have to worry about that amen now look i i'm i've got to quit amen sister amy would you come please unlock the place and took over he possessed the gates of hell on easter morning possess the gates of the grave he has the keys of both death hell and the grave and rose triumphant and we who are look how brother broom types is and we who are dead in christ are abraham's seed we are more than conquerors through him who conquered everything for us no reason for us to have to overcome anything because it's already conquered how do you feel when you are still killing that one bit of your old flesh and you read a quote like this right here and he says there's nothing for you to conquer it's already done how can he say that brother trevor he didn't know paul hail it but jesus christ did and he says you know what this revelation that just keeps opening up to this old paul guy he thinks he's in a great battle of life and death but what he doesn't know is i've already conquered it he's actually just dealing with himself not even all the spirits of laodicea he's just dealing with himself in the greatest battle that's ever fought isn't that something god help us catch that revelation we get over our oh you know you ever hear somebody say that get over yourself usually that's not a very kind word right just get over yourself well i think the lord jesus is speaking to us tonight just get over yourself i've already conquered everything else i've already took care of everything else for you just get over yourself amen oh hallelujah hallelujah you know go home read this there's more there you see that original key that unlocked death hell in the grave also unlocked revelation [Music] god unlocking his word so can i read this last quote to you just another minute or two here i'll read fast now as we check some of these seeds let's think we think of the hebrew children i have here thinking of that on the hebrew children after they had been tested against image worship see how god covers all the different types of trials and struggles and whatever there is he had some tried by this and some tried by this shadrach and meshach they actually have more in common with our day than we think saints they were tried by the spirit of idolatry and we know by the opening of the word that the image that they were tried by was the prophet of their day daniel to bow down and worship that prophet to worship that image even told by the king who had been impressed by the great things that he saw you will worship this image because it was so close to god do you get this so close to god that they got this blurry vision and when they were looking at a prophet they thought they were looking at god because they were [Music] but if our vision clears and we're looking so closely at one another we're looking at god [Music] but you have to have the right revelation you have to have the right understanding thinking that on the hebrew children after they've been tested against image worship now you remember the king said whosoever will not bow down to this image shall be thrown into the fiery furnace now these children believe that god's word was right but they should not worship any kind of an image but when they come to the showdown and they were tested whether they would when all the rest of the children down there received and went to the worship imagine how they felt imagine saints come on we've journeyed together we've lived together we've worshiped together and you see brothers and sisters coming over here and an image has been raised before them and people are saying this is it this is it this is it and you're seeing those who are close to you maybe even family bowing down to an image and god says you know what i don't like that it's not what i called you for you're not idolaters i will break the spirit of idolatry and people are like well i want to fit in i want to fit in and after all it's the prophet of our day it's brother daniel i'm not worshiping the pope not worth worshiping this sports hero this gladiator he's a prophet [Music] hopefully i didn't say that too strongly and when all the rest of the children down there received and went to the worship they went right on in the way the king said they went with the popular thought of the day that they must do it saints we're not far removed in the day within it and when they were tested whether they would worship images or break the word of god they stayed true to the word regardless of the circumstances they stayed true to the word and when they throwed them into the fiery furnace i love these last words why i want to read this god's promise was fulfilled imagine saints if god give you revelation to understand that you being thrown in a fiery furnace was god's plan fulfilled wait wait just a second why would god want to throw me but does the scripture not say that fiery trials maybe we don't have one that we'd call a furnace but god will let you get throat in a fiery trial god's promise was fulfilled they possessed the gates of their enemy there was a fourth man standing in there with a key [Music] you see when the king looked in there and all those people looked in there and they saw the fourth man in the fire what they didn't see if you follow me here one of them was holding the key and he says you know what [Music] i'm gonna unlock all the heat from this fire the very heat that killed the best of their army to throw them in there was now rendered ineffective against the body of the believer oh i'll tell you what thank you lord and it could do nothing but set them free now you're going to say brother paul we're going through some hard trials well i'll tell you what i want you to do maybe maybe mom dad maybe husband wife whatever it is maybe you just want to go off find your own quiet time but if you're in a fiery trial right now i want you to go off in a back corner amen let's just say you go out in the garage and you just start practicing your thank you lords and your hallelujahs and and bless the name of the lord because you see you're fixing to get set free from something you're going through that trial god's not going to let you burn up in this trial called laodicea he's fixing to set you free so we ought to just stand tonight amen and just lift our hands up and say thank you lord for setting me free i'm facing some trials i went through some struggles lord but lord i am fixing to be set free can someone say hallelujah amen because you see it is nothing there but god's way of taking you and proving that i am in control i will set you free hallelujah there's many more quotes if you want to go find him where brother brown talks about that but i'm telling you my brother and sister it's about the trial it's about what you do in the midst of the trial and what the word has told us is we should bless the name of the lord in the midst of our fiery trials hallelujah let's stand and sing a song or two before we're dismissed i'm sorry i took just a little longer than i intended amen but look at this my brother and sister i i hope it's sort of your heart the way it stirs my hand all of these things that are happening all that's coming down we're looking at this this whole thing we call covet 19. we look at this and if we're not careful we'll go oh that's nothing but i can tell you the list of preachers alone around the world pastors alone around the world that have died in the last 12 months is a staggering list [Music] their brother shared a little deal showing right before right in the face of god taking out the leadership and israel coming down and saying what are we going to do now god raised them to a mighty victory you see sometimes god's got to take men out of the way for the people to realize it wasn't our pastor and i say this in humor tonight i'd like to live a little longer so don't put me up on that pedestal amen you see god will remove anything that hinders his bride from progressing forward in the word and i'm not saying that's the reason these brothers passed away brother just brought that up shared that little deal you look at this but around the world a staggering amount of ministers have passed away in the last few months did god just leave us here leadership without leadership i mean no sir [Music] amen it's the lord jesus christ this jehovah himself is our leadership hallelujah oh hallelujah there is [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do i could search for all the eternally lord and [Applause] [Music] there is [Music] one else can touch my heart like you do i could search for all eternity [Music] [Music] hallelujah i know this was a little bit different tonight saints but just kind of wanted to just go through this just a little reminder as we read these things just look at this to realize that the key the original key [Music] unlocks and it has already unlocked the word in you so let that same key go before you make the rocky places smooth unlock the natural things of life unlock the supernatural things of life but most of all right the prophet of god said pray for revelation so let's let this key go and unlock revelation to us we don't need to just sit back and sorry i sometimes i batter on this because it bothers me a lot when i say bothers me i mean i just see this spirit very strong very prevalent people are like we're doing fine god sent a prophet that's good all through the ages god has taken prophets off the scene or study your scripture and let the people manifest the word of the prophet which is the word of god amen so let's take that key of revelation let it open revelation to us because we don't have to just sit back and say well i don't know what god's going to do but somehow we'll do it the word says that this message and this mystery of jesus christ will be revealed and that doesn't mean that it's in some printed form stored somewhere but it's revealed right here in flesh in the day that we live in hallelujah hallelujah the original life amen let's just sing that song as we're dismissed i got a list of songs so long as i wrote these down here just thinking about it but i tell you this song right here just
