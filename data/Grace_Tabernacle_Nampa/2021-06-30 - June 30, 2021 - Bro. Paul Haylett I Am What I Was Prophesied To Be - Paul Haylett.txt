seated remember that chris has got a song why don't you come brother chris so you want to stand and bless your saints [Music] lord just laid the song on my heart earlier today um so kind of a last minute thing but the guy who wrote this song was down on his face praying for forgiveness for taking worship and turning it into a show basically and from that time he wrote this song and sometimes i need to i need a reminder that god doesn't want our lip service he wants worship from our hearts [Music] when the music fades and all is dripped away and i simply come [Music] longing just to bring something that's a worth that'll bless your heart [Music] i'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required [Music] you search much deeper within through the way things appear you're looking into my heart i'm coming back the heart of worship it's all about you it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord for the it's all about you it's all about you jesus [Music] the king of endless worth no one could express how much you deserve no i'm weaking for well all i have is yours every single breath i'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you

to you and everything that i do be pleasing to you praise let everything i pursue [Music] be pleasing [Music] oh yes please let me be pleasing to you and everything that i do be pleased [Music] let everything i personally [Music] hallelujah is that our hearts desire today i believe that's the heart's desire of every christian amen you know often times saints we use terminology like we say well every real christian but if you're a christian you're real there's no fake christian in reality right because to be a christian is to be christ-like so therefore you have to meet the guidelines or qualification to even be a christian so anyway i'm terrible with names and stuff brother peter yes god bless you brother good to see you here i don't know whether to acknowledge you as sister julia's brother or the kid's uncle but either way we're happy that you're here and god bless you amen so let's just um let's just uh you know remember everyone i was just thinking as i was in the back this evening often times we we get so caught up in what we're doing at the moment that we kind of forget about those that are not with us you know maybe i don't want to place my mama first out of any selfish thing but you know sometimes we forget you know uh like my mama over there brother bob sister joe ann uh brother prashaan sister concha you know uh and those in our midst that for whatever reason brother sergey out on the road don't know if he's coming or going north or south but you know just we know their hearts desire i know my brother vasily you know just as you travel the highways you just always uh always you know part of this body of believers and we don't want to be negligent to remind each one and to lift our prayers before the lord right because they come up before the throne of god as a sweet odor uh how many of you uh took the time to listen to the little testimony that brother vasily posted now my brother and sister when you look at that and i'd encourage each one that hasn't listened to that to listen to it because what you're seeing some people would say that is so improbable well i serve a god that does what the world thinks is improbable i serve a god that does the supernatural and to see in this little recording i don't want to give it away or dwell upon it but to see how that god would deal with a heart to do something oh god make us tinder and our hearing uh to be that when he speaks we don't brush it off as just thoughts or some circumstance but to literally say okay lord i i am a son of god and and that struck me very much brother vasily i appreciate you posting that because tonight a little bit of what we're going to hit on will have to do with hearing and uh you know we are truly blessed beyond measure for god to speak to us now it's one thing if i could put it in this context it's one thing that maybe god lays upon the heart of the minister and he preaches something and you hear him or you don't and it might be as it were the wise man the sage an older person with years of experience and says uh i would do this or i wouldn't do this and you listen or you don't but when god speaks and we don't we have a serious problem we want to be mindful of the things of god and to hear him speak to us listen i want to speak to you tonight once again drawing this thought out of uh proverbs uh and i just wonder if anybody uh can say amen to the title amen now i just i say that because look this book right here defines who we are and this is a book of prophecy and sometimes we read it and say well these things will be and it's here in the bible but my brother and sister don't forget that this word of god is prophecy to sons and daughters of god and it's also prophecy to those who never want to serve god it's all right here confined right within the words of god the path of all mankind and i am glad today that i can say i am when i was prophesied to be hallelujah let's just stand and turn in our bibles uh proverbs the 30th chapter and uh forgive me i i was going to uh i was going to look up these words so i could pronounce them correctly so i wouldn't look like i was some uneducated boy from idaho uh but you know my ipad just i don't know i don't want the devil to sit outside and cry because i'm blaming him for something he had nothing to do with but you know i was finishing up my thoughts and my ipad did this great big flicker and half of my notes disappeared poof and so i was like well what was fresh on my mind i kind of put in and maybe the rest was just gone because maybe we would have been burning the midnight hour because i was all excited about this but anyway um i didn't have time to look up these words so forgive me if you say man brother paul you don't have a clue how to pronounce them you are right amen proverbs the 30th chapter starting with the first verse the words of agur the son of jacob even the prophecy my so right here he is acknowledging this the man spake unto i feel and even into feeling you call surely i am more brutish this is quite a claim right surely i am more brutish if you take that word on out you can take it and of course it breaks it down and i don't know if that's just modern english or not but surely i am more rude or surely i'm more surely surely i am more uh abrupt surely i'm more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy but you'll notice right here going into verse 4 there's a subtle shift taking place who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his son's name if thou canst tell every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him i down not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar you know this is actually my brother and sister right here a very kind expression because in the book of revelation it says you add a word or take a word away your name is taken out done away so right here is a very kind gentle reproof add nothing add thou not into his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes yet is not washed from their filthiness there is a generation oh how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men heavenly father we just ask you lord to come tonight and be with each one father present tonight lord or home lord healthy or not feeling well out on the road wherever it might be father just ask you father lead us guide us speak to us lord we ask in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know i look in this and and uh not to dwell on some of this for too long but as you look at this my brother and sister truly the book of proverbs lists these things that are that are what i would call of great knowledge of great value uh to just take the things uh uh to uh share with us uh in a simple uh term to bring us you know i really uh like verse 8 remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches now we look at that my brother and sister and i i'd say that that balance is there you know as you look how god would come and the scripture says that not many mighty men or rich men will make it so i i don't want to pray or ask you or press to become one of those that you know i hope you don't mind the way i word this tonight but i i don't want to choose a path that would reduce the odds of me making it now you say well brother paul we believe in predestination but i believe you understand what i'm saying why our heart is crying for that path that leads us right into righteousness we don't want to just figure out the the least that it would take to make it we don't want to figure out just how little we have to do or how low our life can be lived and still make it i don't believe that is the spirit of god i don't believe that is the nature of god god did not come our lord jesus christ did not come and say you know what i i'm gonna just do just enough to express this plan of redemption so they'll get it but i i don't want to have to do too much my brother and sister the struggle that took place in the garden he's there and it was a real struggle as the drops of blood come as though they were sweat and poured from him and he cried out ultimately expressed i believe what should be the heart's desire of each one of us and it's lord not my will be done because my will wants an easier way my will wants it to not cost so much my will wants it to be in such a fashion lord that it that it is not too tragic or too difficult but he says lord not my will but thy will be done you know we have a spirit that is upon the land today and and we'll find as it is that to to keep the churches full to keep the coffers full to keep a certain degree you might say of popularity in the church we're finding the spirit is a continual decline or compromise to make it more convenient for people to come to church and we have early church and we have late church and we have old-fashioned church and we have modern church and but what we have most of all if we're not careful is a compromised church and god didn't say you know what i want you to do is is just do your best in a compromised way i i don't want you to to have to give too much he actually told us you're going to have to sell out you're going to have to die to yourself you're going to have to give it all for me and it's interesting because it really comes down to and it's difficult for people to to take this but he basically gave it to us as you know what serving me is an all or none situation because anything short of all is insufficient and we think all is not really in the fashion my brother and sister that we would think because we might have money in the bank live in a nice house drive a nice car but we have to give all of our self there's where the real challenge comes we we have to die to ourself and you know as you look at this you realize that every word of god verse 5 every word of god is pure and he is a shield unto them to put their trust in him and my brother and sister it's it's really not a half-hearted you know we can't just kind of trust him today not trusting tomorrow i can trust him with this but i can't trust him with my finances i can't trust him with this but i can trust him here i can't trust him with my marriage but i can trust him with this or you understand what i'm saying you see we've just got to trust him we just got to say lord you're in control and i'm here father thy will not my will be done amen and you know sometimes i think one of the things i just study and brother branham makes this statement and i certainly repeat it because i i see it as absolute truth not just because he said it but you know sometimes a minister might have a little gift and he gets raised up in that gift and he starts to feel like somehow that that gift is him in the sense that he did this or he accomplished this or he prayed the prayer of faith or prayer of healing or he prayed for someone's deliverance and and he does that and and what happened is is then vanity starts to move in in our midst and we start to feel like that we have accomplished something and and ultimately there's only one way that we can move forward especially as a son of god we will ultimately be put to a test and reminded of how little we are verse 9 says lest i be full and deny thee lord never let us come to that place now i want to touch upon this quickly as we move forward tonight there's so much here and i i'm sorry i just tried to not skip over anything but verse 14 says there is a generation actually it starts uh up further but we close this out a generation whose teeth are his swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth you notice we've never had a nation never had a season a time of people it's not just our nation but that words have become so powerful you'll have someone in the right position and they'll say i believe this person that i believe they're this and if it catches what do they call that uh it's trending it's trending isn't it something the gospel in this world is never trending it's always something destructive it's always something negative it's always something perverse that's trending but you see my brother and sister i find humor in this and i hope you do too the young lady greta thundberg stood before the united nations and told them how horrible they was they're destroying her future and she has no future now because they've stolen it from her but yet in europe at a big convention someone figured out what car she was driving and it was clear full of empty plastic water bottles and mcdonald's wrappers the very thing she said was a curse to them but you see in the moment they believe what they're saying in the moment they believe they are these champions of something and we don't want to be that kind of champion my brother and sister that we walk out and and say well i'm this and i'm that but we can't live it we we don't really even have a desire the desire is more to hide what we are than to have what we are exposed but that's not what the word of god said the word of god says whatever's done in secret i will make known openly and i say my brother and sister i am as a man have made many mistakes i would not want brought before this and i place them under the blood of jesus christ and i can walk free with a good conscience with a confidence in god because i know who i am i know that what god has done but we see these last verses here talking about a generation that curseth their father and doesn't bless their mother a generation that's pure in their own eyes oh god help us not to be that generation yet is not washed from their filthiness a generation how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up there's something so uh important within themselves that they feel that that they have accomplished but we'll look at the bible saints and we'll see that through the bible uh you could do a very quick study maybe when you get home or tomorrow if you want or not at all if you don't want but you look through the bible and see how the bible categorizes or brings out generations it lays it down that generations my brothers and sisters can be accounted in a family bloodline and these are the generations and it lays them all out and you see who's a part of that in those generations and uh generations are also used as a timeline it's bringing down uh placing it by generations coming and what will take place in in in these time places there's a a a the timeline of that if you've ever looked my brother and sister at the uh i'm sure you've saw the chart that folds out and it starts with um adam and goes right down through the generation shows how they overlapped in time in their positions when they passed from this earth and all of this and it breaks down a generation you notice nobody's ever done one for the devil there's nobody's thought it was worthwhile to break down the generations of lucifer but you know he has progeny he's got those that carry the family legacy amen the bible says that the generations of some are cursed oh my my brother and sister we certainly don't identify with that do we but it says the generations of some are blessed i say amen oh god let us raise forth families in the natural and spiritual families that would be the generations carrying a blessing going forward that our children would be able at some point in their life raise up and say thank you lord i was blessed to be the son or the daughter and their parents name of their lineage going back grandfathers maybe even great grandfathers but the devil would like to break that lineage he would like to break it and say you know they was able to serve for a season but when i come and he calls it truth and my brother and sister people like to use a really nice big fancy words they like to make it sound sophisticated but i'll just bring it right down we either recognize who we are as sons and daughters of god or we don't it's that simple we don't need to use a whole bunch of big words you know i i could try to dazzle you with some of those but you might say you didn't pronounce that correct brother paul doesn't matter we don't need those my brother and sister i want to be identified i want you to be identified as the generations that carried the pure word of god generations that could stand up and say you know what i had the word of god and in the hour when i needed it you know my brother and sister people get all mistook about the third pull i like how that was brought out in there my brother and sister the third pull is not something for us to just come and it's now a debate the seventh seal being open closed is not something god brought for us just to debate these are the promises of almighty god this is not a theologian-minded man over here in the message and one over here arguing points in quotes in scripture this is revelation that god comes down then in the hour of need and i i wasn't going to listen to that brother vasily i thought i'll listen to it later but i thought well i'm just gonna listen to it and it struck me because it fit right with the thoughts that i was having the hour my brother and sister it's not for us to say it might be but it's for us to say it is amen for us to stand on the word and in that time of need have enough confidence in god to be able to stand up and say lord you are the master of the sea you are the one i tell you what my brother and sister now imagine there was some shock people there on the shore when they're thinking we've got to do cpr to this guy and he coughs and stands up hallelujah i'm telling you because prayer is answered god answers our prayer the word says that our prayers come up before him as a sweet odor this is not something he says well i'm gonna ignore that i don't like that you've all done that smelled something maybe it's a flower you know how in our neighborhood they have a lot of mint fields they've started to cut them when i drive by one of them fields i feel like just backing up and rolling the window down smells so good if we could envision that's what our prayers come before god not whether he heard it or not did my prayer hit the ceiling just go away no sir a sweet odor but you know the word of god as i've spoke to you many times it's not self-fulfilling see the presence of god comes where he's made welcome he doesn't just want to hear you pray he wants you to welcome him he wants you to create the atmosphere that's why we should never pray like we're beggars that's right we should pray like we are sons and daughters of god not come as it were sometimes our emotional state sometimes the condition that we are in uh make us sound like we are begging but it is the difference of the spirit because one can be broken in their spirit and crying out to god but yet praying and crying out in confidence or we can simply come like the man that might approach you on this street oh flattery might work with this man oh kind sir looks like all is well with you could you please spare a poor beggar like me cut through the trash what's wrong with your life why are you here you know i found that works really well because the ones that are genuine will actually break down and tell you i i had a good family i did this i did that i blew it all and i just lost hope and somehow i ended up here and this is the state of my life but others say no oh no you know it's all about what you're going to do for me no i'm sorry i'm the kind of man i want to know how you got here because that's how we get you out of here right so we look at that and we trust god too see that the generations and to make a claim my brother and sister tie this back real quickly just to be able to move on those that put the blood over the door had revelation or understanding or just simply simple obedience now many of them i would opt that it was simple obedience that they put the blood over the door because we see their future actions if it had been revelation that put the blood over the door it would have been revelation at the red sea it would have been revelation in the wilderness of sin it would have been revelation that kadish barnea would have been revelation taking them across but it wasn't it was just obedience what we need is a revelation that obedience is part of it but it's got to come from the heart and it's not just i did this check i did this check he said do this check it's got to come to a place that will be and i i hope that i can articulate this to you in the next few minutes but you see my brother and sister it comes that we are a generation that has by the word of god god been declared to be a blessed generation now look uh speaking of behavior taking place in a specified time i i didn't give this uh to brother alex and i should have just to put it here but you know the scripture second timothy the third chapter and this talks about how in the last days perilous times shall come and it describes all those things that are wrong right lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient uh without natural affection truce bakers false accusers incontinent traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and this is what i really wanted to have having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof my brother and sister having the form means nothing if you have denied the power of the word in our lives if we come to the place that we feel like well i've done all this i've been to church my parents raised me in the church and and it doesn't seem to have made any difference it just doesn't work i think i won't even bother trying to serve god you are working on the form what we got to do is get away from the form and get into the relationship amen because you see we we don't need to just know this message we don't need to just know our bible and you know how i feel about that my brother and sister when people say well do you believe the message yes i tell you what i believe the message with all of my heart here is the message to our hour here is the word did god send a prophet to break this down and tie the loose ends together that we would be able to look in the word of god now i hope i can articulate this to you because you see my brother and sister it's not just about we have a message there's a lot of people have a message and they'll have your wallet if you ain't careful you know sometimes i wonder you know brother brown i'm kind of eluded that there would come a day that god would just name names over the pulpit i've been working on my list glad somebody thought that was funny but that's not what god's looking at he's talking about a sovereign moving of the holy spirit not to shame an individual but in the right moment to expose the individual no sir the devil god saving the individual exposing the spirit that's binding that individual that's why some preacher that would ever name a name or or come down to do to expose someone's sin they might be sincere but they're sincerely wrong amen so we look at this and see now this is a timeline right because generations also can be brought to uh expand or show a timeline and we see here in ii timothy here is a timeline last days perilous times this is what will happen now here brother branham says in the pool of bethesda i thought i would read this scripture that you would understand that the holy spirit that was upon jesus is on this church today can someone give me a real amen this is not we just have another form of religion this jesus christ right here in our midst today my brother and sister the holy spirit and moving in the same manner as the robe of elijah fell down on elisha so these things that i do greater shall you for i go into my father and the robe fell on the day of pentecost that brought glory back to his people that god lives in his church and his spirit moves upon his people so if the spirit is not moving upon the people something's wrong in our church man thanks come on yes thank you we have to acknowledge if the holy spirit's not moving in our midst church we have to acknowledge there's a problem not just well the preacher had an off day ain't got nothing to do with the preacher come on who's driving this church saints who's trying to need the preacher if it is we got a problem the holy spirit coming down moving in our midst god lives in his church and his spirit moves upon his people we must first realize that we're living in a day of skeptic and i'll tell you in the last half a dozen to ten years or something we have sure seen the skeptics pop out you know that have you ever noticed i i jokingly say this to put it in a context because you know me simple here do you know that the go head which i know you all love go heads they're just the most wonderful beautiful plants ever got that beautiful little yellow flower you don't want to get down on your hands and knees to admire it though do you know the goat head the way god made it after everything else has dried up and is starting to fade away is when the goat head sprouts and i put it in this context we've sprayed every weed on the farm everything's just brown and you know on the ditch banks and the roads and we're just happy with ourselves and you come back a couple days later and it's all green so in the last days i mean let's face it saints if you said brother paul um you got to choose between the two weeds on your farm you either get kosher or you get go ahead i would choose kosher any day of the week because all you got to do is show it the roundup jug and it dies but look what happens in the last day after all these other things have come then revealed the skeptic comes right up in the last day why because the devil is waiting until you are exhausted from your uh you might say endurance test uh you're exhausted from this race of life and then he comes right in is this not the truth when we get discouraged already when we have troubles in our life the wheels fall off the wagon and then the devil comes right in like a flood at that moment when you have just been through revival and you are prayed up and you're ready to go out and knock the devil for a loop my brother and sister he just goes and sits down drinks lemonade but when you have become discouraged he shows right up and he's always got someone to tell you why this isn't truth always someone out there generation of people who will not believe jesus said though the dead be raised they wouldn't believe them words has to be fulfilled somebody now look here now 90 percent that satan promised he would have has to be on the other side we know that it has no matter what would take place they still would not believe it they'll try to find some way to believe different now this is kind of like the modern term cognitive dissonance right they people use that they say well you're denying all the evidence that's in front of you all the facts that are in front of you you deny them my brother and sister that's what it takes to be a real christian because you just have to go drive down through the town of nampa in the middle of the night on a friday night and all the things you can actually see smell hear taste so to speak you know what i mean is there would tell you that there's probably not a god on this earth i've been places my brother and sister i i wouldn't go into that that might be a little bit to throw you for a loop but i have lived in a world that the evidence that the devil has control is very evident i'll leave it at that they try to find some way to believe different even our master was called beelzebub a spiritualist and how much more will they call them that's of his household we have to contend with that is that not true but brother that doesn't shake my faith one bit see if this sounded discouraging i needed you to just hang on long enough to get a hold of this it don't shake my faith a bit it only increases my faith in him for all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution and here's the thing i want to catch back coming back into this now and the mystery to me was as plain as the word was being taught that men and women can't understand one of the greatest mysteries on this earth my brother and sister is someone can read a scripture and they can't see it applies they can't see the relevance of that scripture they they can't put it together and if you you know it's interesting and and i don't encourage you to do this but i will just say it i i kind of sometimes would just do it for entertainment sitting in a tractor you know it and um you go to the right uh radio station and there will be men like hank anagraf come on there and they'll be the bible answer man and they'll be these different things and people call in and say i was reading my bible and i read this scripture and i i just can't make heads or tales of it i asked my pastor he don't have an answer either i'm calling you to get an answer and i'm sitting there jumping up and down inside the tractor saying can i answer can i answer can i answer but you see my brother and sister without revelation without god opening that and then you see these men trying to explain it and they're like well you know from the sub-region of this uh the aramic says this and we this and we do that and literally one man i was proud of the man he comes down to the end of this like 10-minute discourse about an answer to this deal and the guy goes uh you never answered my question this over national radio you know but what did he do he gave him a long deal and he goes no i did answer and he goes no you didn't answer my question click he shuts him off there's only one that can give the answer my brother and sister and that's jesus christ himself because he interprets his own word oh thank the lord that he come down to you and i and said just a second let me be an interpreter for you i'm your personal interpreter i'm not going to just interpret it for the preacher and he's going to try to explain it to you i'll come down to you and be your interpreter hallelujah hallelujah so it doesn't shake our faith one bit they live godly they suffer persecution the mystery is as the word being taught that men and women can't understand there's a real mystery truly did isaiah say you have ears but can't hear it eyes but can't see it and we see the very evidence of that coming forth it's it's very very strong in coming forth my brother and sister in the day that we live in now this is a thing that that we increasingly are facing i i i you know sometimes we live in a little different world uh and and that reminds me god bless you greetings from brother jewell sends greetings to each and every one of you today him and sister vanessa amen but we're coming to a time now my brother and sister more and more that people are wanting the message explained to them yes sir so we can do well if we can look up all the words and we have all these things we have all of our reference guides and we can come and go through that and then we explain as though we had a first-hand experience of what that was and and so as people are wanting the message explained it is showing there is a lack of revelation now i'm not i'm not faulting please don't think i'm being critical of this sometimes it's the wrong teaching people are being encouraged to dig into the message as though they are studying a science project a mathematical problem or something of that nature to dig into it in that realm that now if this is this i must be able to go over here and find a reference of time for this i must be able to find a reason i must be able to find an explanation but that's not how god works that's not the the method or the plan that god chose and so it is that as people are increasingly wanting the message explained they're increasingly moving into an intellectual discourse we're moving into a well god sent a prophet and we can go to a scripture and we can go to a scripture and this is this because we can go to a scripture and that's great my brother and sister we should know our bible as good as a baptist but do we but knowing your bible and being able to say it's this verse it's this verse it's a chapter doesn't do anything if it's just an intellectual discourse an intellectual tutorial i come across the other day that uh for you know fairly cheap i thought you know like 29.95 or something uh you can get this one-year course where every week they send you these studies these lessons these deals and at the end of the year they assure you that you will be able to answer anyone's questions concerning the bible that's good but remember those people coming and saying um we see the gift of god moving and i've got cash here if you can give me a portion it's the day we live in yes simon you go ahead and do that and we can set you up on monthly payments no sir what was the answer your curse take you and your money and go you're cursed so there's no way my brother and sister that we come into this day and god's gonna let us just pay our tithes and give our offerings and come to church as though it was some intellectual discourse that we go home from wednesday and sunday a little more educated in the message now you know i don't want anyone to lift a hand i don't want anyone to make a comment i don't want no one to say amen or yea amen or yeoman or whatever but i want to ask you how many of us are praying for revelation prophet of god said it he laid it out really strong he didn't say this is option number 25 or when nothing else works my brother and sister he said above and beyond these things we should be praying for revelation otherwise grace tabernacle has a nice intellectual discourse with it should stimulate each one of us to pray for revelation that lord you'd reveal yourself and your word to me like never before because where does rapturing faith come from our iq our memorization our abilities no sir rapturing faith cometh from hearing the word of god and the hearing of the word isn't just we put on a tape we listen to the preacher it's hearing the voice of almighty god see so they can't see it now i tell you what kind of tutorial we need i believe in tutorials you know that i love them i love tutorials there is the two knee tutorial it's where you get down on two knees and god tutors you there is the inspiration of the holy spirit tutorial where you might be driving down the road thinking about something that you read or heard and suddenly the mind is open and you say praise god i never saw that before i like that tutorial also that's the one where god opens the window of his word to us and something we've heard spoken for maybe days weeks months or years suddenly is made real to us hallelujah what is it it's revelation in the soul my brother and sister we can do fine with revelation in our mind i i like that you know i can tell you that many many times after the fact and sometimes in the middle of the night i will wake up and i believe you're probably the same way you'll wake up and you'll go hmm that's how to fix that oh that's what i need to do i'm talking about natural carnal type things amen you wake up in the middle of night oh that's why that won't work that's good but how about we open the door that god would come and in the stillness of the midnight hour wake up and say lord i see it i see the word that you were trying to show me that's been preached to me over and over and over again now look my brother and sister i'll just throw this out there to you hopefully i don't offend anyone but you look at this my brother and sister as the prophet of god is talking about the tent vision and everybody grasp the holds of that and they're like okay the prophet's got to come back there's going to be a service he's going to be in there people are going to walk into this and they're going to walk out they didn't know what happened but something changed their life forever and people took that and you might say a literal physical sense and it was there caught up in that now it never came to pass as the prophet of god shared it because it was not a physical event in the flesh taking place it was a spiritual revelation it was a spiritual opening to the soul and that little room my brother and sister was a holy ghost coming down in this little room right here and he was declaring not just to a prophet but he was declaring to those who were under that dispensational ministry right he was the first fruit take it back to your bible he was the first fruit and so he was sharing then of that first fruit to us and by revelation we catch that that as a but because he says you know what when this third poll happens it will not be a public event it will not be a public uh expose and so it's there as the holy spirit comes and moves down into the soul of sons and daughters of god they're having a life-changing event and the world out here is not going to be able to copy that they're not going to have a blueprint god designed the prophet of god says you don't even speak those things you don't even want the devil to know but what is it something changing and what it does is it changes us from being church going message believers to bible believing bible living bible expressing bible worshiping believers there's quite a difference my brother and sister there's quite a difference i'll skip over some of these little details that i had thrown in but you look at this see satan's made this promise but you see this sermon very i loved it just a lot to me it just really spoke to me you know god meets with sons of men many times in different forms and in different groups different councils different numbers one time he met with them where there were 500 gathered together one time he met with them and there was 70 together he met with him when there was 12 gathered together then he met with them when they were three gathered together and where one god meets wherever men will gather together he has promised to meet and so this afternoon it's most surely that he is here to meet with us today in this nice gathering of people here in this auditorium this afternoon can someone say amen amen we know god will meet us here he made that promise [Music] he didn't throw anything in now i'll meet you there if this man preaches or i'll meet you there if that man preaches he said he would meet us here god loves to commune with his servants he loves to make himself known to sons of men he loves to show his power any bible reader who reads the bible knows that god loves to display his power look at this now i like this because sometimes we'll say well i just don't know why this is happening i don't know you guys probably never ever said that in your life i don't know why this is happening he brings men into situations they cannot figure out in order to show them that he loves them and leads them look at israel on their journey what was the type of the journey today so let's we can just go right back we obviously won't do it tonight but we can go right back just start reading my brother and sister starting with the promise to israel that they would sojourn for 400 years and that they would be brought out and you can look through and see how it all fits perfectly and here we are today amen and so it's there look at israel on their journey type of this journey today how he would lead them right into death's trap then display his power so i want to reference this back to as i was sharing with you we put blood over the doorpost but we get to the red sea we followed moses's command that the lord said and put the blood over our doorpost now we're at the red sea and suddenly it's moses you brought us here to die wow it didn't take very long i hope our faith lasts longer than that i hope your faith in the word of god lasts longer than their faith did after seeing the supernatural imagine they got to look out the window and see the literal death angel flying down the street swooping into homes and the screams and moving on they saw that my brother and sister and yet in just a short time they're down here at the red sea you brought us here to die come on we don't want to be those kind of message believers we don't want to have a revival we don't have one a brother andrew brother jewel you know brother tim cross or one of these come and just preach us so happy we're shouting and singing in the next week wondering why god doesn't like us come on that's what happened in egypt god don't love me god don't love me brought me here to die i believe that's why god let me say let me find my spain look at israel the dirty type of journey today he would lead them right in death trap then display his power when favor would say i will let them go and then god said nope i'm going to harden his heart just in order to show his great power and i believe that's why god is letting things happen the way they are today that when this great rush finally comes he loves to show his power and display this great rush maybe the one that started a pandemic and he's talking about gonna have a a uh petroleum lockdown you can't prove you have a reason we're going to take your car away from you and you keep your house too cold or too warm we're going to do you see my brother and sister it's all about control yeah has nothing to do with the environment look the devil don't like the devil don't care about this earth it's just another tool this place loves the sun sons of men reading a few days ago this scripture has always been an outstanding one to me i seem to catch a new revelation come on i want you to catch that here's a prophet of god reading his bible and all of a sudden he catches a new revelation about something in scripture there wasn't an angel come down and reveal this scripture to him it was an anointing of the holy spirit within him reading the word and the word speaking back to him and i seem to catch a new revelation and you know god's word is so eternal and it's so inspired that it's not just for one occasion or for one generation the word of god is so eternal the same and the truth till it will the same word inspired the disciples it inspired the first robe despite disciples then the next as they followed down through the lutheran age down through the methodist age in every age just as efficient sufficient inspiring today to us as it was the first day it was given can someone say amen to that and if the word would stand a million years the word would still be just as inspired to the generations that will follow us as it is to us because it's perfect and it's always given for the time how great god does in his word how that even before the world was ever formed god at his infinite mercy and his empathy he he foresaw all things and before he ever spoke one word the bible said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and now the word becomes a part of himself then and then a word is a thought expressed and when god saw where his fellow worker with him satan which was the son of the morning had deceived him in a way that he had entrusted him with great things and he had perverted what god had created to make evil out of it god thought the whole thing in his mind and then he spoke it and it become true and it become part of him and can never never fail it's him he is the word and so god before the foundation of the world knew that you would be here i hope i'm not just reading i hope this inspires you amen knew that you would be here he knew you by name before the foundation of the world think of it many times we sing the song a new name written down in glory it was in air it was written down before there ever was a human being on the earth your name is written in the lamb's book of life amen think of it the bible said that jesus was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world taken four thousand years for that to materialize this is why saints this quote a long time ago is why i for a long time have spoke to you that the lamb being slain took place calvary was just an earthly expression of it that we could understand the price four thousand years later he was actually slain but when god spoke the word in the beginning he was slain right then because god's word can't fail see it and the bible said in revelation the last chapter of revelation that the beast would deceive all those that dwelled upon the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world don't that make you happy ought to just make us just be able to jump up and shout and disrupt the whole service to realize my brother and sister it's not what happened today it's not what happened yesterday or last week or your mistake over here or your mistake over there he wrote your name in that book and that settled it hallelujah now we know that sons and daughters of god when they make a mistake amen they'll put it under the blood they won't just say i'm covered and go on they will put it under the blood amen don't that make you happy to think that our names were written before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain our names was associated with him oh amen what a pitcher and what a truth isn't that beautiful i like that it just stirs my heart to realize it's not even today oh can i tell you all about today do you guys have enough time tissue you don't good because i don't even want to tell you there's a prophet of god as i read the quote to you sunday don't let that negative stuff come out of your mouth but just give you a hint didn't have a very good day yeah geocapitalist minded people you would understand what i'm talking about but none of that matters because by revelation my name is in that book what happened today doesn't even matter what mattered was when he spoke my name your name before the foundation of the world that's what mattered that was the only thing he said brother paul life's been treating us really rough well why don't you just go read the scripture just forget about reading your bank statement forget about reading all the letters that come in the mail to you and all the what people spout over the telephone to you why don't you just go read the word of god and then respond to it that's it he said that i am a son of god now look my brother and sister you see as these as i spoke earlier i want to just close this out as i spoke earlier you see we have these prophecies of a generation that won't respect father nor mother uh they they will gnash upon with their teeth they destroy it's just a terrible now that is a prophecy my brother and sister when you look in the word of god those words were spoken not as a might be but they were speaking in a complete uh um oh i won't use that word it's big and whatever cumbersome speaking in a complete total expression are you with me this generation is going to show up that's going to be this way they're going to behave like this this is going to be how they act this is how they think this is what they do and this is what they express and it's it's come to pass today every bit of that out of the book of proverbs 30th chapter has taken place right here today and the prophet of god in the quote i was going to make note of that but i didn't it's not just for one occasion so you say well we can see that took place here in history and here in history that's right and it's taken place again so we see this comes this word is literally as it were prophecy to you and i and so as we'll look at this and realize that this word of prophecy in proverbs is producing the generation of that prophecy true amen but we have a word that peter shared with us it too is prophecy and it says but ye well hallelujah brother alex and i are well you're saying his words are just as anchored in the word of god as the words of proverbs declaring what a generation will be like and here he says you're a chosen generation you are that generation now my brother and sister i want to tie you back real quick here the skeptics are going to tell you none of this applies we're just here until god comes and whatever happens and just do oh don't you say no i don't know brother paul it's not that way yeah i'm sorry i have way too many friends out there i got way too many i hear their expressions they're like you're just way way too radical paul you need to chill out paul we can just kind of do these things paul we can drink a little bit we can chew tobacco and we can dance once in a while and we can do these things and we're just as good a christian sounds good doesn't it strangely enough it doesn't sound good to us does it some would say yes but to you it doesn't sound good thank you lord thank you lord see you're hearing something different scribes your job description is to show praises to the king of kings and the lord of lords it would change our whole perspective of i make this mistake and i make that mistake amen you know what when you repent that comes as a sweet odor to god amen and when you praise him it comes and when you pray it comes all of this is coming up this is what god expected out of you so instead of looking at what i'm not look at what you are amen your sons and daughters of god you are that generation just as they were a generation to disrespect their parents and to be evil and gnash upon with their teeth and consume and destroy my brother and sister you're the generation that was called to bring praises to god you're the one that god said that's one i can choose amen that we could show for praises of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light i'll tell you what there's enough skeptics will tell you oh well this is wrong and that is wrong well one thing i'll tell you my brother and sister that and this is a little abrupt this is a little direct a little blunt but i'll tell you what when i look at these skeptics as a as we've we've read this scripture this is a time this is a season but when i look at these skeptics i look at them and say i don't like your theology i don't like what you said here i don't like what you did there i don't like that you don't like the message that's what they think we think but you know what i'm really doing i'm looking at their life and something in me says i don't want that life that's not the life i want it's not an argument about what is and what isn't and who is and who isn't and whatever i don't want that life maybe it's because we've been called into the light the light just showed us this isn't what you want now look one more little bit of word of god that i would say i take this kind of prophecy john 15 15. see now look at this henceforth i call you not servants see early on in scripture he's talking about servants here he says henceforth i call you not servants this is our lord jesus you got a red letter bible this would be in red letter for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth see here's here's a giant step from just being a servant we've stepped into it now we're not just blindly following but he says right here a servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have past tense made known unto you hallelujah how glorious we're not sitting here now just dumbfounded about what god wants out of us not dumbfounded about the life that we're called to but we have revelation hallelujah you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that soul whatsoever you shall ask of the father my name he may give it you hallelujah sister amy would you come amen i'll just stop right there saints but you look at this how beautiful this is we're that generation we're that generation that has been blessed to have the word of god open and my heart breaks when i run into people that still in this day and age as much word has been preached still feel like the bible but even more so the messages a book of do's and don'ts you know that reason that it's dues and don't saints is because they haven't got it off the page yet and got it written on the heart but when they get it off the page and they finally get it written on the heart and no longer be do's and don'ts it actually and we could extend this out tonight and finish out my thought but i'll just try and encapsulate it we can actually look at the do's and the don'ts but it suddenly becomes more of the ones [Music] i want closer to him i want to live a life that expresses his life i i want to be one that he says well done my good and faithful servants it's not about a do or a don't it's about something inside of us stirring us i want i want to love you lord i want to praise you i want to serve you all the days of my life i want to be found faithful in that day and i want to hear i will hear those words well done my good and faithful servant because you see you were chosen for that position isn't that beautiful god didn't just cycle it through you know reminded me a friend of mine years ago almost had me convinced to join the military i mean we're talking cat whisker close joining the military [Music] they promised him half of the moon said he could work his way up to the other half of the moon but when he actually got in the military they pretty much went okay the first 50 of you go that way next 50 of you go that one next 50 go that way and then when they got there they said this is what you'll be grunt see all their promises didn't matter none of that made any difference but if you could catch my thought tonight as i close god said first 50 goes this way no ain't ever you come right down in the midst of all humanity and said i choose you and i choose you and i choose you none of this first 50 christians here first 50 christians there he went right down he was so selective and not only that he verified it and that's why the devil hates you so bad it's because he wrote your name in the book and that become the anchor of satan's animosity toward you because he says man i i've got to be able to defeat him the book says i can't and i won't but i've got to but what is it when god called us before the foundation the world he already had the light and at the day chosen he just turns it on and here we are serving the lord today loving the lord today desiring oh hallelujah all saints i got to stop i got i got more to give you amen but we're not on buffet night so hallelujah well it's that holy ghost and fire and man let's just stand up worse with the lord for a minute hallelujah i want you to go home if i could if i could you know kind of put this upon you i want you to go home and before you go to bed tonight i want you to take a moment standing kneeling whatever you want to do and thank the lord for what he has done for you lord thank you for turning on the light thank you lord for putting the desire in my heart thank you lord that my ears here thank you lord that my eyes see amen before we go to bed tonight let's make sure we thank you hallelujah would you do that you know i don't know saints okay let me just throw this out too many times now i know it's i know what how i behave is not how you would behave but too many times when we go to bed at night it's like lord forgive me for this and lord please this and lord that and the lord how many times do we go to bed maybe i'm missing maybe i'm missing but i just ask you don't risk your hands but how many times do we go to bed thank you lord thank you lord for saving my soul thank you lord that no matter what the devil burn my house down blow my crops down tear this up and do this thank you lord for saving my soul but most of the time it's like lord blowing to me now i'll tell you why this is special to me [Music] the middle of the night last night the wind blew really hard out our way i drove down to the river today the whole end of one of our corn fields that was about that tall is now that tall it's pretty hard to say lord thy will be done but thank you lord but you know what that cornfield ain't got nothing to do with my eternal destination and the lord is in control and i have to be able to go to bed at night and say thank you lord for saving my corn field no sir for saving my soul that's all that matters it's not about cornfields it's not about the wheels falling off the wagon it's about our souls hallelujah oh somebody's singing hallelujah oh i want to be alive i don't want to be old dead christian is keeping me alive oh well it's all over me and it's bubbling up inside all bubbling up [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] oh it's keeping me alive oh he's keeping me alive [Applause] thank you lord so glad i'm alive tonight amen hallelujah hallelujah jesus set me free hallelujah amen aren't you glad you've been set free oh the devil's so clever he's got all kinds of handcuffs he's got all kinds of things well you didn't recognize it did you sometimes the devil just creeps in it kind of puts a little downer i want to just ask you real blunt tonight is there something really bubbling up inside or was that just a song [Music] i wanted to be real to you saints i wanted to be alive that we are people we're not just going to church hallelujah well i tell you what i had a friend unfortunately kind of kind of not really following the message anymore i know heartbreaking for me but i've gotten a lot of hope not that he comes back to the message that's not for me to control but he made a statement to me he said i no matter what happens i want to be a real christian i believe donald answered that prayer and you know what forget about that he's in or he's out thing that's my prayer i want to be a real christian i don't want to be a fake i don't want to be an imitator i want to be the real deal because he made a promise am i on the scripture off here when he said i will lead you and guide you until altar or did he say i would lead and guide the prophet to alter well he did actually because he was speaking [Music] but he didn't apply it he didn't say the church he didn't say the message he said you hallelujah have confidence saints rejoice give praise to the lord he told you what this work is i began in you i am gonna finish it that ought to get us all excited to say thank you lord tonight amen he's finishing the word well i'm so glad oh jesus set me free i'm so glad all jesus set me free well i'm so glad jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah lord jesus set me free well i'm so command oh jesus lifted me oh i'm so glad jesus i
