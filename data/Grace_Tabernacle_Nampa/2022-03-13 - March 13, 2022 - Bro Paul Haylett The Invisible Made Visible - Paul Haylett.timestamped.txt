[33:33] brother barry was preaching to us
[33:35] on the sunday morning following the
[33:37] marriage seminar
[33:39] and he was telling us
[33:41] we need to stop

[33:46] and see how great
[33:47] our god is
[33:50] we get so caught up we get so busy we

[33:57] see how great
[33:59] our god is and i say lord help us to
[34:02] take that time to look to you and see
[34:06] how supernatural how incredible how
[34:10] beautiful how powerful and how
[34:13] compassionate you are
[34:15] oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord
[34:19] amen
[34:20] well
[34:22] just have a few things that i want to
[34:25] share with you before we start
[34:27] first off i want to
[34:29] welcome
[34:32] the tea catch family and the grant
[34:34] families amen uh just a lovely time of
[34:37] fellowship uh
[34:39] forgot how fun these people were
[34:41] amen but um we've been reminded and
[34:44] we're really happy to have you here with
[34:46] us
[34:47] amen
[34:52] i want to give you greetings had
[34:54] specific instruction from brother berry
[34:57] coffee brother danny stevens brother
[34:59] stacy goodbread to send greetings to you
[35:04] and
[35:05] just some great things come out of that
[35:06] we went to a marriage seminar was
[35:08] encouraged to to hear these things the
[35:12] encouragement uh the reminder
[35:15] that god is the one who established the
[35:18] institution of marriage
[35:20] and that's why satan is fighting so hard
[35:23] against it
[35:24] and
[35:25] so just remember whatever troubles come
[35:27] our way remember this was god's ordained
[35:30] plan and god's in charge and if we will
[35:33] just stay on the word of god just uh
[35:36] you know
[35:37] continue to remind ourselves and look up
[35:39] and see how great is our god it was just
[35:41] a lovely time amen and so um
[35:45] we want to
[35:46] also
[35:48] uh just mention here um
[35:51] to remember the ukraine and and those
[35:53] that are laboring on their behalf um
[35:56] you know saints it's uh sometimes
[35:59] uh we we see things take place we see
[36:02] uh actions taken there's there's uh food
[36:06] and clothing and shelter arranged and
[36:09] it's removed from us and we kind of tend
[36:12] to forget there's someone who's laboring
[36:14] at that someone who carries a burden and
[36:17] you know my brother and sister it is the
[36:20] grace of god as we look at these things
[36:22] to realize that that god had a plan and
[36:26] you know we are here
[36:29] and maybe our struggle might be in the
[36:30] greatest battle ever fought
[36:33] and and we're struggling with something
[36:35] in our life and we don't see buildings
[36:38] blowing up and craters in the street but
[36:41] satan would desire to you know blow up
[36:44] and crater our thoughts and our
[36:47] confidence and who we are and and uh you
[36:50] know it's there that god's preparing us
[36:53] right because remember
[36:55] that uh power without character is
[36:58] satanic and
[36:59] we are on the very cusp saints
[37:02] of the releasing of the greatest power
[37:05] ever
[37:06] and uh when i say that that power
[37:08] actually has already been released
[37:11] and we are seeing the manifestation of
[37:13] that and what is coming forth and uh
[37:16] brother uh
[37:19] isaac will you put that photo up just
[37:21] want you to see
[37:23] this is just a small representation
[37:26] of those you are praying for
[37:29] huddled in a basement
[37:31] with
[37:32] cannon firing rockets explosions and all
[37:36] kinds of things taking place around them
[37:39] and i just wanted you to look this
[37:41] morning and just
[37:43] realize that it's not just an inanimate
[37:45] prayer request that we're praying for
[37:47] out here of of just something but real
[37:50] believers
[37:52] and i believe i can say with a hundred
[37:54] percent that if that was us in the
[37:56] basement they would be praying for us
[37:58] and so just be faithful i i pray just to
[38:01] lift these saints there's many many
[38:04] other photos
[38:05] that
[38:06] brother berry is being very faithful to
[38:10] gather together and
[38:12] disperse
[38:14] and
[38:16] so uh
[38:18] we want to
[38:19] we have given an offering
[38:21] uh here just a
[38:23] few days a week or so ago from the
[38:26] church
[38:27] and
[38:28] just in communication with brother berry
[38:31] he's not so listening fun so i don't
[38:33] want anybody to get the idea that
[38:34] brother berry is running around trying
[38:36] to collect money
[38:37] but
[38:38] in in talking with him just a couple
[38:40] days ago
[38:42] uh we're going to make another offering
[38:46] as we put it in terms i believe it was
[38:48] brother barry that actually brought it
[38:49] up in this fashion in the beginning but
[38:52] it's good to have a pipeline but if
[38:54] there's nothing in it
[38:56] then there's nothing to be received and
[38:58] so we're going to be
[38:59] sending another offering in um probably
[39:03] a couple weeks or a little bit shy of
[39:05] that
[39:06] and
[39:08] it's been mentioned to me hey
[39:10] i didn't know what can i do so i want to
[39:13] put it this way um just put it in the
[39:15] offering
[39:16] or whatever mark it specifically for the
[39:19] ukraine
[39:20] and we will we will pass this on amen
[39:24] and uh
[39:25] but let me put it this way also if i i
[39:28] don't have to put my foot in my mouth
[39:30] i'm giving away as it were your money
[39:33] and this is what we as believers freely
[39:35] give into the body of christ into the
[39:37] church not to now god's blessed us we're
[39:40] finishing up our basement here and we're
[39:42] blessed in that fashion but the prophet
[39:45] speaks many times that god did not give
[39:48] these blessings to us to build great big
[39:50] churches fine robes and big houses and
[39:53] cars but to do the work of the body of
[39:56] christ and so i i just encourage you if
[39:59] you have something that's been laid upon
[40:01] your heart you want to give just just go
[40:03] ahead and mark that and put it in the
[40:05] offering or give it to brother ivan or
[40:08] brother isaac and
[40:10] we will make sure that that money uh
[40:13] makes it to the ukraine
[40:15] already lovely reports uh coming back
[40:19] of the needs that have been met
[40:22] you know uh god is
[40:24] you ever had god just answer a need just
[40:27] so specific you knew it was no man no
[40:31] person no whatever figured this out and
[40:34] we're hearing those kind of reports out
[40:36] of
[40:36] the ukraine
[40:38] of needs very specifically money coming
[40:41] on time
[40:42] and brothers going into the stores
[40:45] and literally able to buy
[40:47] all that they needed
[40:50] and then
[40:51] maybe thinking well we should maybe get
[40:53] a little more of this going back and the
[40:54] store is completely empty
[40:57] nothing there
[40:59] now you know the lord knew what time
[41:00] that those funds needed to arrive in
[41:03] their hands
[41:04] to be able to go and and satisfy those
[41:07] needs and
[41:08] so um we just want to remember them so
[41:12] uh brother abel is going to um
[41:16] be coming
[41:17] it's interesting how it is time
[41:21] you know it's been a while since brother
[41:23] abel sister hattie come to visit us and
[41:25] people are like i don't remember them
[41:28] well whether you remember brother abel
[41:30] or not you're going to be blessed
[41:32] and uh this coming sunday and we're
[41:34] going to have a fellowship to follow
[41:37] we should be hearing a whoo-hoo out of
[41:39] somebody
[41:41] amen in the basement
[41:43] amen so
[41:46] just uh looking forward to that and so i
[41:49] don't know you know i'll leave this to
[41:51] to
[41:52] you know i hear this phrase often said
[41:55] my people will contact your people
[41:57] so sister jerry is my people
[42:00] and um sisters you are your husband's
[42:03] people
[42:04] and so if you would all coordinate with
[42:06] one another uh on the food and then we
[42:09] also definitely want to stress uh
[42:11] coordination on the desert amen so
[42:17] i have
[42:18] something that is very very dear to my
[42:20] heart this morning to share with you
[42:23] and
[42:24] it makes my heart exceedingly glad
[42:27] to see god moving in our midst to see
[42:32] the blessings that god has poured out
[42:34] upon us and
[42:36] our sister daniela
[42:39] is going to be baptized after the
[42:41] service this morning
[42:44] and i just say thank you lord
[42:46] may the power of god continue to move in
[42:49] our youth
[42:50] amen just my time flies
[42:54] my niece
[42:56] baptized what a privilege for brother
[42:58] chris
[42:59] to baptize his daughter
[43:01] uh how how special
[43:03] uh elena just um you know having a
[43:06] desire in the heart we're seeing this
[43:08] where it's not a little fad or a fashion
[43:11] like oh look i ought to do this
[43:14] but it is a continual voice coming back
[43:17] to the parents saying
[43:19] i want
[43:20] to do this
[43:22] and that just stirs my heart it's not oh
[43:25] they did it i'll do it also but
[43:26] something that's been ongoing
[43:29] over a course of time
[43:31] the mention you know dad mom i want to
[43:34] get baptized and and that's what we love
[43:37] to see and we don't want this just to be
[43:39] an event as it is but we want it to be a
[43:42] marker a milestone in their life that if
[43:46] the lord tarries
[43:47] years that they can look back and say
[43:49] you know what there was my anchor post
[43:51] it was jesus christ and and so i'm very
[43:54] very happy to announce that so just ask
[43:57] you all not to run off
[43:59] uh after church and uh we'll all meet
[44:02] down in the basement and we're going to
[44:05] have a baptism
[44:07] thank you lord and then maybe you want
[44:09] to take a moment to look around and
[44:11] and see
[44:13] the fellowship hall there
[44:15] amen before i start into my thought
[44:19] amen
[44:20] so this is my starting point let's push
[44:22] play
[44:23] amen
[44:24] i just want to just felt very led to
[44:27] share this with you saints with all the
[44:29] things that's happening in the world
[44:30] today we look around china is making its
[44:33] threats uh we're gonna we're gonna take
[44:35] over taiwan and if you mess with us
[44:37] you'll regret it we see what's happening
[44:39] with russia we see what's happening all
[44:42] over these little signs of the times
[44:44] that are there and uh you know i just
[44:47] want to re reiterate to you this morning
[44:50] do not be afraid of the nations
[44:53] you see that's what satan wants us to do
[44:55] now the prophet of god pointed these
[44:57] things out the word of god he he brought
[45:00] it out right god interprets his own word
[45:02] but it got brought out and we look at
[45:03] the signs that it's there but don't be
[45:05] afraid of the nations because my brother
[45:07] and sister a lukewarm spirit is much
[45:10] more dangerous than the nations
[45:14] so let's not get distracted with what's
[45:16] going on in the world around us
[45:20] because that's not our issue right
[45:22] the scripture says that if they kill our
[45:24] flesh no big deal the first death but
[45:27] the second death the spiritual death is
[45:30] the one we should be concerned with so
[45:32] while you look at the news however you
[45:35] look at the news
[45:36] i encourage you just to be focused on
[45:39] the fact god made a promise he cannot
[45:42] fail
[45:43] and we are standing on that promise
[45:44] today by the word of god
[45:47] now you know we can go brother chris
[45:49] posted a lovely quote there to uh
[45:52] a lovely posting to the church whatsapp
[45:55] and you look at these things my brother
[45:56] and sister the encouragement we look at
[45:59] this
[46:00] if god ordained you and i
[46:03] we can't miss it
[46:06] if god ordained a loved one husband wife
[46:09] children
[46:10] distant relatives
[46:12] they cannot miss it
[46:14] so what we want to do is walk and live
[46:17] in the perfect will of god
[46:19] that we could have the effectual fervent
[46:22] prayer of a righteous man which that
[46:24] scripture includes our sisters
[46:27] the fervent effectual prayer not the
[46:29] prayer of desperation
[46:31] not the prayer of the forlorn
[46:34] or discouraged
[46:36] but the fervent
[46:37] effectual prayer
[46:39] that is a prayer the prophet of god says
[46:41] that has no hindrances
[46:43] coming to the throne of god
[46:46] my
[46:47] those are the prayers that make a
[46:49] difference
[46:50] the lord help us amen let's just stand
[46:53] as we go to the word this morning thank
[46:55] you brother jason
[46:57] sister emmy brother sean i appreciate
[47:00] that
[47:01] amen
[47:03] i want to speak to you
[47:04] once again you know sometimes it it
[47:07] seems
[47:08] maybe
[47:09] hard for everybody to make the
[47:10] connection of the two sides of obedience
[47:12] but it makes sense to me so at the
[47:14] moment that's all that mattered to me
[47:16] but uh you know we look at this and the
[47:18] reason i have and as i explained to you
[47:20] before the two sides of obedience is
[47:23] because we will either align ourselves
[47:25] with the word of god or we'll align
[47:27] ourselves with the spirit of
[47:28] disobedience
[47:30] and so as we come into this realm of
[47:33] obedience to the word
[47:35] then we would find ourselves looking at
[47:37] the word
[47:38] now you don't have to raise the hand you
[47:40] can say men if you feel like it
[47:43] but it's not always easy saying amen to
[47:46] the word of god
[47:50] there's things in our life we come face
[47:51] to face with
[47:53] and we say oh my
[47:56] but what we don't want and we'll touch
[47:57] on this in a little bit we don't want to
[47:59] ever let that become a seed of doubt
[48:02] a seed of fear
[48:03] or a seed that we become resistant to
[48:06] the word now we're not talking about
[48:08] man's ideas we're talking the word
[48:11] and so as we come in that my brother and
[48:13] sister there's always these two sides a
[48:15] decision that we must make
[48:17] i want to title this thought today
[48:20] the invisible made visible and i take
[48:22] this from a quote and
[48:25] we shall share that in just a few
[48:27] minutes
[48:28] amen we'll go into the word of god
[48:30] john the 13th chapter this morning
[48:33] amen
[48:34] starting with the 12th verse and
[48:37] we'll see that this is part of the
[48:39] scripture that we take a communion time
[48:42] and
[48:43] we'll
[48:44] kind of move beyond that and expand you
[48:47] might say the thought because we often
[48:49] just stop right there in the reading of
[48:51] the word
[48:52] amen
[48:54] so after he had washed their feet and
[48:56] had taken his garments and was set down
[48:58] again he said unto them
[49:00] know ye what i have done to you
[49:03] now saints i want to take this for just
[49:05] a moment outside of the context of
[49:07] communion
[49:09] know ye
[49:14] what i have done to you
[49:17] yeah you've taken me out of the pit
[49:19] you've taken me from the briar patch
[49:20] you've taken me from despair you've
[49:23] taken me and you set me up in heavenly
[49:25] places oh today we should know what god
[49:29] has done for us we don't need little
[49:31] weak need limp handed oh yeah god save
[49:35] me no what did he save you from
[49:38] oh what did he do to us saints oh how
[49:41] beautiful i say thank you lord
[49:44] you call me master and lord and you say
[49:46] well for so i am if i then your lord and
[49:49] master have washed your feet ye also
[49:52] ought to wash one another's feet for i
[49:54] have given you an example that you
[49:56] should do as i have done to you
[49:58] verily verily i say unto you the servant
[50:00] is not greater than his lord neither he
[50:03] that is sent greater than he that sent
[50:06] him if you know these things happy are
[50:08] ye
[50:09] if you do them
[50:10] amen heavenly father we ask you to come
[50:13] this morning speak to our hearts lord
[50:15] and we just open our hearts today lord
[50:17] we come hungry we come thirsty we come
[50:20] desiring father reassurance of your word
[50:23] father a greater opening or revelation
[50:26] of you father just asking lord to see
[50:29] you more clearly
[50:30] ask you to speak to every need today
[50:33] father we as a needy people continually
[50:36] face changing circumstances and lord we
[50:39] don't just need one answer father and we
[50:42] need you to be with us each and every
[50:44] day lord to speak to us and we ask your
[50:47] blessings upon the saints lord the bride
[50:49] of christ around the world
[50:51] father specifically today lord the
[50:53] saints in the ukraine lord we love you
[50:56] and adore you we ask this in your
[50:58] precious name amen you may be seated
[51:03] and you know we look at these things as
[51:05] it is pertaining to communion and
[51:08] you know i i thank the lord for that
[51:10] because uh
[51:11] i know for myself that communion is a
[51:14] time
[51:15] that i just have a i don't know a great
[51:18] bubbling
[51:19] a great something pushing up in my soul
[51:22] just to think back as a as a man and the
[51:26] shortcomings that i would have as a man
[51:28] and what the grace of god has done for
[51:30] me and
[51:31] communion is you know very very special
[51:34] to me now i want to go on into these
[51:37] other verses
[51:38] now he says here i speak not of you all
[51:43] so as he's speaking the word he's
[51:46] declaring that
[51:48] this doesn't apply to each and every one
[51:50] when we when we talk about the hypocrite
[51:53] and we talk about the idolater these
[51:56] words don't apply to everyone that's
[51:58] hearing them and so he says i speak not
[52:01] of you all i know in whom
[52:04] i know whom i have chosen
[52:06] but the scripture may be fulfilled and
[52:09] so it's there is he speaking these words
[52:12] out
[52:12] you know i remember as i was working my
[52:15] way back to the lord many years ago and
[52:18] it's to me is more of a paradox as i get
[52:20] older and what god has called me to do i
[52:23] i look how faithful the lord was that
[52:26] here i i was a young man drifted away
[52:30] from the principles of the gospel and
[52:33] yet i could look and see that uh when
[52:36] when i first started coming back to the
[52:38] lord and they would talk about the
[52:39] hypocrite i felt crushed
[52:41] i was like that's me
[52:45] but as time went on and the word was
[52:47] washing me
[52:50] when it talked about the hypocrite there
[52:52] was something that come alive
[52:55] and i realized some of my behaviors are
[52:57] hypocritical but i am not the hypocrite
[53:02] because god was revealing or opening his
[53:04] word for us to see then it's not this
[53:07] flesh that is going to judge us but it's
[53:09] in the spirit or the heart of man and so
[53:11] it's in that realm that we come and as
[53:13] we start to see the word open up and be
[53:18] revealed or revelated to us we start to
[53:20] realize that as satan wars against the
[53:23] flesh god is redeeming the soul and so
[53:27] there is the conflict of man right there
[53:29] that's why we have this great battle my
[53:31] brother and sister not to downplay it
[53:33] this morning but the greatest battle
[53:35] ever fought will not be armageddon it
[53:37] will not be you know on the plains of uh
[53:40] europe or on the plains of america the
[53:43] greatest battle as the prophet of god
[53:45] said will be fought right here and so
[53:48] it's there that satan in this
[53:49] battlefield is trying to brand you with
[53:52] certain titles or certain things that
[53:54] would brand you to a place that you
[53:56] would say you know in this position i
[53:58] cannot reach out and claim this promise
[54:00] of god because i'm not worthy but god
[54:03] said you know what i have made you
[54:05] worthy and so it's there that i am not
[54:08] talking to you when i speak these words
[54:10] of judgment because by revelation you
[54:13] will judge yourself
[54:16] that's the thing i find so beautiful my
[54:17] brother and sister we don't have to
[54:19] hammer away at the church judge yourself
[54:21] judge yourself judge yourself because
[54:24] the holy ghost will come down and stir
[54:26] our heart and soul and we will find
[54:29] ourselves compelled to judge ourselves
[54:32] oh thank you lord
[54:33] amen so it's there he sees i speak not
[54:37] of you all i know whom i'm chosen can we
[54:39] say this morning thank you lord that we
[54:42] know who he has chosen also he has
[54:44] shared that revelation with us
[54:47] amen that the scripture may be fulfilled
[54:50] and that's something that we must never
[54:52] forget we can look around now
[54:54] it's a bad habit and lord help me i'm
[54:56] getting better at this habit but i have
[54:58] a habit of sometimes looking back saying
[55:01] well you know if i had stepped right
[55:03] instead of left
[55:04] if i had not bought that or done this if
[55:06] i had not done any of you ever do that
[55:09] yeah you know in some terms they call it
[55:11] buyer's remorse and other terms they
[55:13] call it second guessing however it would
[55:16] be but you see my brother and sister the
[55:18] word of god has come and has made its
[55:22] declaration
[55:23] and god will move you
[55:26] i almost included it this morning a
[55:28] lovely quote about brother branham
[55:31] speaking about john i should include it
[55:33] because i'm going to speak it now and
[55:34] just butcher it but uh how that john
[55:37] raised up
[55:39] in in this position of god and then he
[55:42] comes back down now god
[55:44] used him for this incredible ministry
[55:48] and then he comes back down and brother
[55:49] brown uses this word he laid aside those
[55:53] great big wings
[55:55] and he finds himself in prison
[55:57] sending a a servant or a brother out
[56:02] are you the one
[56:04] now jesus doesn't rebuke it and say oh
[56:06] he he lost it he says no
[56:09] this in this quote he puts it this way
[56:12] you just sit here in this meeting you
[56:14] see the supernatural then you take the
[56:17] testimony back to him and he'll know
[56:21] amen look what god's done for us my
[56:23] brother sister how many times have we
[56:25] come to a place in our life that we are
[56:27] like well am i part of the bride is this
[56:29] right i have a friend or a family member
[56:32] that's quit and they're telling me this
[56:34] is this is this is that and that's there
[56:36] and you're deceived and oh what do i do
[56:38] but then god comes and he puts someone
[56:41] back in our life maybe it's a sermon
[56:44] that's preached maybe it's a friend with
[56:46] encouragement or a scripture that is
[56:48] read whatever it might be and it reminds
[56:50] us and we can go then and pick those
[56:53] wings back up and go up into heavenly
[56:55] places
[56:56] oh satan would desire to keep us
[56:59] grounded amen you know there's more when
[57:01] brother branham shares these little
[57:02] stories
[57:03] people are like oh okay that was a cute
[57:05] little story well i'll tell you what my
[57:07] brother and sister i would definitely
[57:09] was an eagle in a chicken yard
[57:11] amen and i heard a call
[57:13] i know what that is it's not just a
[57:15] little story and i thank the lord now
[57:18] this might seem silly to you but i thank
[57:19] the lord because he didn't say now when
[57:22] that eaglet heard that cry he jumped in
[57:26] the heavens and flew off
[57:29] no sir he gave me hope because all i
[57:31] could do is make it to the top of the
[57:33] post
[57:35] but from the top of the post i had
[57:36] broken the bonds of gravity in the
[57:38] chicken yard
[57:40] and then it was there i realized i
[57:43] actually can
[57:45] these are here for purpose they're
[57:47] they're not
[57:48] now let me put it back in the human
[57:49] realm they're not to be put in our
[57:51] pocket
[57:53] they're not to be like uh yeah
[57:56] oh somebody praise the lord
[57:58] amen
[57:59] no sir
[58:01] these were given to us set free for a
[58:03] reason
[58:04] that we could lift
[58:06] our wings as it were
[58:08] praise the lord
[58:10] now look how it is
[58:12] he that eateth bread with me half lifted
[58:15] up his heel against me now brother
[58:17] branham says the apostles had no idea
[58:19] what jesus was talking about something
[58:21] was taking place in their midst and they
[58:24] were not revelated to understand it at
[58:28] that time amen now i tell you before it
[58:31] come that when it is come to pass you
[58:33] may believe that i am he verily verily i
[58:36] say unto you he that receiveth
[58:37] whomsoever i send receiveth me he that
[58:40] receiveth me receiveth him that send me
[58:43] low i tell you what you talk about a
[58:45] strong bond god has given us by saying
[58:48] amen to the word and being able to
[58:49] believe when jesus had thus said he was
[58:53] troubled in spirit and testified and
[58:55] said verily verily i say to you that one
[58:57] of you shall betray me now my brother
[59:00] and sister this i believe would have
[59:01] come as a shock to the apostles they
[59:04] would have been sitting there and saying
[59:06] whoa what what what are you talking
[59:07] about betrayal you're what are you
[59:09] talking about because my brother and
[59:11] sister we'll touch on that in a minute
[59:13] you see there had been an atmosphere
[59:16] that had been around them and you know
[59:19] we all kind of tend to scrutinize one
[59:21] another don't we that's why god doesn't
[59:23] want a spirit of criticism or judgmental
[59:25] spirit in the church because you know my
[59:28] flaws and i know yours
[59:33] and sometimes i know yours because
[59:36] something just reveals it i don't have a
[59:38] clue
[59:39] you're not going to find brother paul
[59:41] peeking in your family room window
[59:45] but god wants these things to be dealt
[59:47] with in the body right he doesn't want
[59:49] us to become liberal christians that hey
[59:52] you know we we've been predestinated so
[59:54] therefore we god will give us a pass on
[59:57] this my brother and sister our god's a
[59:59] holy god he's a righteous god he wants
[1:00:01] us to line up with his word his word is
[1:00:04] that perfect example as it would be a
[1:00:06] young man is saying you know
[1:00:08] if i ever get married this is the kind
[1:00:10] of wife i would like to have and it's
[1:00:12] vice versa for young ladies you know my
[1:00:14] brother and sister it's only out of
[1:00:16] desperation we would settle for
[1:00:18] something less than what god ordained
[1:00:20] for us and so the bride of christ is not
[1:00:22] going to come to a place that we settle
[1:00:25] for something because we decide the word
[1:00:27] is unattainable the word is attainable
[1:00:30] oh and we'll get into that i'm getting
[1:00:32] excited excuse me here if i bounce
[1:00:34] around a little this morning he said now
[1:00:36] the disciples looked on one another
[1:00:42] is it you
[1:00:44] you you
[1:00:46] who is it
[1:00:48] well i hope if we ever come face to face
[1:00:50] with that which we actually do
[1:00:52] that we'll go find the mirror of the
[1:00:54] word
[1:00:55] and not say is it you but say lord is it
[1:00:57] i am
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:03] they looked on one another doubting
[1:01:06] look at this saints
[1:01:07] do you see this
[1:01:09] doubting
[1:01:10] of whom he spake in other words they had
[1:01:13] such a feeling of confidence in their
[1:01:16] midst that when they looked around they
[1:01:18] said it wouldn't be him it wouldn't be
[1:01:19] him it wouldn't be him with him and they
[1:01:21] actually were doubting the very words of
[1:01:23] our lord jesus christ because they
[1:01:24] couldn't imagine anyone would quit the
[1:01:27] message after
[1:01:28] 10 15 20 30 40
[1:01:32] years
[1:01:35] you said
[1:01:37] who
[1:01:39] no way
[1:01:42] no way i just heard him preach such a
[1:01:44] powerful sermon
[1:01:46] just a month or two ago
[1:01:50] i doubt that can be true
[1:01:56] now there was leaning on jesus bosom one
[1:01:59] of his disciples whom jesus loved
[1:02:02] simon peter therefore beckoned to him
[1:02:04] that he should ask who it should be of
[1:02:07] whom he spake
[1:02:09] he then lying on jesus breath saith unto
[1:02:11] him
[1:02:12] lord who is it jesus answered and said
[1:02:14] he it is to whom i shall give soup and
[1:02:17] when i have dipped it and when he had
[1:02:19] dipped the salt he gave it to judas
[1:02:21] iscariot the son of simon
[1:02:24] now i want to i want you to catch this i
[1:02:26] hope you catch this this morning this
[1:02:28] powerful moment of time that just a few
[1:02:31] minutes ago no one would have believed
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:35] judas would have betrayed jesus but in
[1:02:37] this powerful moment of time that it is
[1:02:41] when he dipped the sap he gave it to
[1:02:42] judas iscariot the son of simon and
[1:02:45] after the sop
[1:02:47] satan entered into him
[1:02:50] but i'm here to put it in this context
[1:02:52] to you this morning my brother and
[1:02:53] sister satan knows well and good that he
[1:02:56] cannot come up against a son or daughter
[1:02:59] of god and overpower them there has to
[1:03:02] be as it were a season of preparation
[1:03:06] there has to be a tilling of the soil of
[1:03:09] the soul to make it able to receive we
[1:03:12] see how god worked in our life sometimes
[1:03:15] he has to almost grind us stubborn ones
[1:03:17] amen somebody will say amen to that
[1:03:19] grind us down and that is the
[1:03:21] preparation of the field and others it's
[1:03:24] just a stirring in the soul and we see
[1:03:27] but god said i'm not going to judge you
[1:03:29] by how much grinding i had to do i'm not
[1:03:31] going to judge you by these other
[1:03:33] factors i'm going to judge you because
[1:03:35] my word predestinated it's you
[1:03:39] and i will do whatever it takes for you
[1:03:41] to come
[1:03:46] he gave it to judas this carried the son
[1:03:48] of simon after the
[1:03:50] satan entered into him
[1:03:52] then said jesus unto him
[1:03:54] that thou doest do it quickly
[1:03:57] now no man at the table knew for what
[1:03:59] intent he spake this unto him
[1:04:02] see they are still in a condition of you
[1:04:04] might say a a a uh
[1:04:07] oh wow
[1:04:09] the word just escaped me
[1:04:12] they're naive
[1:04:14] they're naive i had another kind of
[1:04:16] sophisticated sounding word but it got
[1:04:18] away from me
[1:04:19] but uh
[1:04:20] they're they're in this this state you
[1:04:22] know they're kind of like looking
[1:04:23] through a fog they're like what what is
[1:04:25] he talking about i can't see what he's
[1:04:28] what he's talking about because they
[1:04:29] still really don't catch the fact that
[1:04:32] in that moment now god could have
[1:04:34] initiated this moment my brother and
[1:04:36] sister any way please but that's the way
[1:04:38] he pleased
[1:04:40] and god could initiate my brother and
[1:04:42] sister
[1:04:43] any way he pleased in this generation
[1:04:46] but it is the way he pleased
[1:04:48] men come and say we don't need this and
[1:04:50] we don't need this and this is off base
[1:04:52] and these people that believe the
[1:04:53] message of william branham i'm sorry i
[1:04:55] don't know anyone personally who
[1:04:57] believes the message of william branham
[1:04:59] but i do know a lot of people who
[1:05:01] believe the message of jesus christ
[1:05:04] amen because it was never brother
[1:05:06] branham's message in the beginning
[1:05:08] amen that's just what the word says
[1:05:10] saints never was his message in the
[1:05:13] beginning and it will never be as it
[1:05:15] were his message now is he responsible
[1:05:18] for the correct delivery of it just the
[1:05:20] same as the ministry in this church or
[1:05:22] any ministry is responsible for the
[1:05:24] correct delivery of it but it's not our
[1:05:26] message
[1:05:28] it's god's message it's always been his
[1:05:30] message and will always be his message
[1:05:33] amen so as we look at this we see now my
[1:05:37] brother and sister is this comes to pass
[1:05:40] we see how that the scripture must come
[1:05:43] now to interact as it is that uh satan
[1:05:46] entered into him i should have just put
[1:05:49] this on the screen because there's quite
[1:05:50] a bit of reading but i think you'll find
[1:05:52] this is a novel fact here now incarnate
[1:05:56] is having a human body
[1:06:02] invested with bodily and especially
[1:06:04] human nature and form
[1:06:07] now see how god is coming down my
[1:06:09] brother and sister
[1:06:10] not only god but the devil
[1:06:12] he didn't just come to
[1:06:14] uh uh enter into and turn it into
[1:06:18] something ugly
[1:06:20] you know we live in the world they make
[1:06:22] all these creepy movies
[1:06:25] and they got all kinds of monsters on
[1:06:27] the earth
[1:06:28] but i'm sorry satan's much more subtle
[1:06:30] than that
[1:06:32] he entered in
[1:06:35] can you say amen
[1:06:37] he entered in he didn't turn into some
[1:06:39] kind of monster it was still judas
[1:06:43] it was still judas that everybody knew
[1:06:45] and everybody had prayed for and
[1:06:47] everybody had lived with and everybody
[1:06:49] had went and held special meetings and
[1:06:51] preached with him and saw a powerful
[1:06:54] ministry
[1:06:55] and this is why they were shook up
[1:06:57] because they said how could this be how
[1:07:00] could he be the betrayer i heard him
[1:07:02] preach this over here and people come to
[1:07:04] the altar and i've seen this and i've
[1:07:06] seen this but you see my brother and
[1:07:08] sister god knew that there was coming a
[1:07:10] season and in that it brother branham
[1:07:12] shows us very clearly how it was there
[1:07:14] that this ministry was imparted from
[1:07:17] jesus christ himself to judas that's
[1:07:21] right so he wasn't even in a way what
[1:07:23] you'd call an imposter
[1:07:26] it was a real deal
[1:07:28] until he got to a certain place
[1:07:31] and at a certain place in time certain
[1:07:33] things happened
[1:07:36] invested with bottling especially human
[1:07:38] nature and form made manifest or
[1:07:40] comprehensible
[1:07:45] let's go on
[1:07:47] now some of you will actually understand
[1:07:48] what the dictionary is talking about
[1:07:50] here
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] you know adjectives
[1:07:58] transitive verbs
[1:08:00] an english teacher high school she says
[1:08:03] paul i'm going to pass you
[1:08:04] i said thank you very much mrs gurkey
[1:08:06] she said well don't thank me so much is
[1:08:08] i just don't want to have to deal with
[1:08:10] you again
[1:08:12] so you know adjectives diagram of
[1:08:14] sentence all this kind of stuff i
[1:08:16] thought yep the prophet god said that
[1:08:18] they'd hide it from the wise and the
[1:08:20] prudent and i believe this kind of stuff
[1:08:21] is what he was talking about but you
[1:08:24] look at that now let's come down here
[1:08:26] all joking aside into incarnate used as
[1:08:30] a transitive verb
[1:08:32] and look at this to make
[1:08:34] incarnate as
[1:08:37] or to give bodily form and substance to
[1:08:40] and this is webster
[1:08:42] not only online is it
[1:08:45] but the lovely gift i was given of those
[1:08:47] big huge dictionaries
[1:08:50] get this even webster believes in the
[1:08:53] devil
[1:08:55] even webster believes in serpent seed
[1:09:02] to give bodily form and substance to
[1:09:05] incarnates the devil
[1:09:07] as a serpent
[1:09:10] wow hallelujah all the religious people
[1:09:12] say that's other
[1:09:13] nonsense and here's webster
[1:09:15] saying yep nope the devil
[1:09:17] went down
[1:09:18] right into a serpent
[1:09:20] i wonder if the theologians they
[1:09:22] probably use the new online american
[1:09:24] version
[1:09:25] hallelujah now look what happened here
[1:09:27] saints
[1:09:28] judas opened the door
[1:09:31] to those spirits
[1:09:33] there come a time in judas's life now we
[1:09:35] know that the word must be fulfilled but
[1:09:37] there come a time in judas's life that
[1:09:39] he had come to a point that he started
[1:09:41] to hedge and pull back and it was there
[1:09:44] that he was like well i don't know about
[1:09:45] this and i'm not sure about this and i
[1:09:48] just don't see how this could be and the
[1:09:50] door is now being opened up one was just
[1:09:53] a simply unlocking another's a turning
[1:09:56] of the knob another's a nudge here and
[1:09:58] the door is being opened up for this
[1:10:00] time and so just as this scripture
[1:10:03] declared
[1:10:04] about judas my brother and sister i want
[1:10:06] to i want you to catch this tie to the
[1:10:08] opening up amen about how we receive and
[1:10:11] what we receive the opening up right
[1:10:13] just as the scripture declared a judas
[1:10:16] amen the scripture declares a rahab the
[1:10:18] scripture declares an esther this
[1:10:20] scripture declares a bride in this day
[1:10:24] that will be true to her vow
[1:10:26] oh just as said judas is there allowing
[1:10:29] the door to be opened up to those
[1:10:31] spirits there is a bride on the earth
[1:10:33] today that is allowing the door to be
[1:10:35] opened up to the holy ghost to come in
[1:10:38] and though it seems impossible it seems
[1:10:41] too hard that that spirit upon us and we
[1:10:44] are there you know when brother branham
[1:10:46] said a real believer will say amen to
[1:10:49] every word of god he wasn't just talking
[1:10:51] about form and formality amen amen amen
[1:10:55] i don't know what he's talking about not
[1:10:56] sure i believe what he talked about amen
[1:10:58] i fulfilled that no my brother and
[1:11:00] sister down in the heart and soul of the
[1:11:02] real believer there's something
[1:11:05] compelling them to say it's hard lord
[1:11:08] but i say amen to the word i claim this
[1:11:11] word for my hour
[1:11:14] and in that place my brother and sister
[1:11:18] the door is opened
[1:11:20] to spirits
[1:11:23] every one of us has been possessed by
[1:11:25] one
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:28] and unfortunately sometimes we see in
[1:11:30] life people
[1:11:31] that we thought had one
[1:11:33] end up having another
[1:11:36] you see this brine
[1:11:38] because as the scripture declared there
[1:11:42] the scripture must be fulfilled
[1:11:44] there must be a bride aren't you glad
[1:11:46] aren't you glad it's not even up to me
[1:11:48] it's not even up to you there's
[1:11:50] something inside there's been times
[1:11:53] saints i have preached and repented in
[1:11:55] the pulpit and you probably didn't even
[1:11:57] know
[1:11:58] why because as we're preaching a thought
[1:12:00] the word strikes my heart and says i'm
[1:12:02] talking to you paul you think i'm
[1:12:04] talking to them but i'm talking to you
[1:12:07] and there it is by the word of god god
[1:12:09] compelling us
[1:12:12] see now in the seven church ages here
[1:12:15] we'll look here now
[1:12:17] brother branham
[1:12:18] lays this out very clearly
[1:12:20] let me show you what i've been trying to
[1:12:22] teach all along about the two vines
[1:12:25] which come from the two different
[1:12:26] spirits
[1:12:27] take the example of jesus and judas this
[1:12:29] time jesus was the son of god judas was
[1:12:32] the son of perdition god entered into
[1:12:35] jesus
[1:12:36] satan entered into judas
[1:12:39] jesus had a full holy ghost ministry for
[1:12:42] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with
[1:12:45] the holy ghost and with power who went
[1:12:47] about doing good and healing all that
[1:12:49] were oppressed of the devil for god was
[1:12:52] with him acts 10 38 it says for he judas
[1:12:55] was numbered with us and obtained part
[1:12:57] of this ministry so he wasn't there my
[1:13:00] brother and sister as a total imposter
[1:13:03] you see there was a time in judas's
[1:13:05] ministry that judas would have said i
[1:13:07] believe every drop of this but something
[1:13:10] entered in so subtle
[1:13:17] i'll use a little farming analogy if you
[1:13:19] don't mind
[1:13:22] giant amaranth
[1:13:25] which
[1:13:27] is a plant that looks like pigweed and
[1:13:29] most of you probably don't know what
[1:13:30] pigweed looks like but giant amarath
[1:13:34] will produce 140 one plant
[1:13:37] 140 000 viable seeds
[1:13:43] and when introduced into a field in four
[1:13:45] years will completely take that field
[1:13:47] over
[1:13:49] you follow me
[1:13:51] introduced
[1:13:52] and within a period of time
[1:13:54] has completely taken it over
[1:13:59] so we see how that satan he's not going
[1:14:02] to come as a frontal attack to you
[1:14:04] because you're going to back up and say
[1:14:05] hey no i'm not doing that but he comes
[1:14:07] so subtle he comes and slips his way in
[1:14:11] and start planting his seeds and as more
[1:14:14] time is given to him the more seeds he
[1:14:17] will plant which means saints i'll just
[1:14:19] put it in common terms the more you're
[1:14:21] going to have to do to get that out of
[1:14:22] your life
[1:14:25] that's why the word of god the prophet
[1:14:27] the word of god anointed the prophet
[1:14:30] to preach to us repent every single day
[1:14:34] weed the garden every single day
[1:14:38] therefore you don't have to fight and
[1:14:39] say well it's impossible now but you can
[1:14:41] just stand and say by god's grace i'm
[1:14:44] here today amen he went doing good he
[1:14:47] was numbered with us and obtained
[1:14:48] obtained part of this ministry acts 1 17
[1:14:51] matthew 10 1 and when he had called unto
[1:14:54] him his twelve disciples he gave them
[1:14:55] power against unclean spirits now you
[1:14:58] didn't see jesus say now i'm going to
[1:15:00] give power to unclean spirits but i know
[1:15:03] that judas is going to betray me so i'll
[1:15:04] limit his
[1:15:06] no sir he had this full authority of the
[1:15:09] word up to this time but it shows you
[1:15:12] that a man even under full authority now
[1:15:14] i'll put at this blunt i made the
[1:15:16] comment earlier you can have men
[1:15:17] preaching sermons that bring people to
[1:15:20] the altars to a true repentance and they
[1:15:23] themselves can go no further
[1:15:27] it's kind of scary
[1:15:29] it's actually very scary to see how this
[1:15:30] works
[1:15:32] he gave them power against unclean
[1:15:34] spirits to cast them out in the hello
[1:15:36] manner of sickness and all manner of
[1:15:38] disease
[1:15:39] that spirit that was in judas went right
[1:15:41] along through the ministry of jesus they
[1:15:43] both come to the cross jesus was hanged
[1:15:45] upon a cross gladly giving his life for
[1:15:47] sinners and commended his spirit to god
[1:15:50] his spirit went to god then was poured
[1:15:52] out into the church at pentecost but
[1:15:55] judas hanged himself and his spirit went
[1:15:57] back to satan but after pentecost that
[1:15:59] same spirit that was in judas came back
[1:16:01] to the false vine imagine my brother and
[1:16:03] sister that spirit is here today
[1:16:07] now we're not going to run around the
[1:16:08] world to people we would disagree or
[1:16:10] we'd feel it might apply and say you've
[1:16:11] got a spirit of judas on you these
[1:16:14] things have to be manifested the word of
[1:16:16] god says let it be manifested we're not
[1:16:19] here to judge it and cut it short
[1:16:21] amen we're here to let the word of god
[1:16:23] be manifested
[1:16:25] amen so you look at this uh come back to
[1:16:28] the false vine grows right along with
[1:16:29] the true vine but notice judah's spirit
[1:16:31] never got to pentecost
[1:16:34] now i want you to catch these things
[1:16:39] and never went up to receive the holy
[1:16:40] spirit
[1:16:48] sometimes starting with our children i
[1:16:51] want them to catch this
[1:16:53] we sit back and act like if god wants me
[1:16:56] to have it
[1:16:58] he'll give it to me
[1:17:02] god wants me to have a family he'll give
[1:17:05] it to me god and in one sense that's
[1:17:07] right
[1:17:09] that do you see
[1:17:11] we have to play our part
[1:17:13] we have to put our effort in
[1:17:16] judas
[1:17:17] never sought
[1:17:19] the holy ghost
[1:17:20] brother brown never once brings up that
[1:17:22] he sought it and never found it
[1:17:24] he never sought it
[1:17:26] he had a form of godliness but denied
[1:17:30] the full power thereof of the holy ghost
[1:17:34] and so it's in that realm he never
[1:17:35] actually comes and when it come into the
[1:17:37] crux of the whole moment my brother and
[1:17:39] sister there was a void there and that
[1:17:42] void would be full and uh would be
[1:17:44] filled and so uh it's there so what's
[1:17:47] brother brahms say here never went up to
[1:17:49] receive the holy spirit it could not
[1:17:52] but what did jesus spirit go for it went
[1:17:55] for the bag of gold how it love money it
[1:17:58] still loves money if it goes about in
[1:18:00] the name of jesus doing mighty things
[1:18:02] and holding great meetings it still
[1:18:04] makes more of money and buildings in
[1:18:07] education everything with a material
[1:18:08] concept just watch that spirit that is
[1:18:11] upon them and don't be fooled
[1:18:13] jesus so he said that spirits here today
[1:18:15] let's look out here amen some of these
[1:18:18] ministries that are around the world you
[1:18:20] know got three litter jets working on
[1:18:22] number four because none of the rest
[1:18:23] were the best
[1:18:26] and they believe that prosperity is
[1:18:28] godliness
[1:18:33] judas went about as one of the twelve
[1:18:35] and he did miracles too
[1:18:37] i want you to catch this line
[1:18:43] but he
[1:18:44] did not have the spirit of god
[1:18:48] as his own
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] he had
[1:18:52] a religious spirit
[1:18:56] he had a spirit if you don't mind me i
[1:18:57] don't mean to be rude but he had a
[1:18:59] spirit that could literally say hey god
[1:19:01] has sent a prophet in this generation
[1:19:03] that's exactly right but you see that
[1:19:05] acknowledgment is not the holy ghost
[1:19:08] let's not offer up an alternative to the
[1:19:11] baptism of the holy ghost it is not
[1:19:13] something we recite
[1:19:16] it's a life
[1:19:20] so he says right there he did not have
[1:19:22] the spirit of god now he recognized the
[1:19:24] spirit of god he knew what the moving of
[1:19:26] the spirit of god can you say amen we
[1:19:29] know when god comes down and moves in
[1:19:31] our midst saints we are not oblivious we
[1:19:33] know when the presence of god is in this
[1:19:35] building
[1:19:36] amen and so he knew that side of it but
[1:19:39] he didn't know it as his own it was
[1:19:41] though he was there and he would be able
[1:19:43] to say something special something
[1:19:46] supernatural is happening right now but
[1:19:48] it isn't my brother and sister that it's
[1:19:50] happening it needs to be happening to us
[1:19:53] not even to us in us
[1:19:55] amen he says in that way right now in
[1:19:58] this synagogue of satan right he was not
[1:20:00] a true child of god
[1:20:02] oh let me get back i lost my place he
[1:20:04] did not ha he did have a ministry
[1:20:07] he never got to pentecost as he was not
[1:20:09] true seed he was not a true child of god
[1:20:11] no sir and it is that way right now in
[1:20:14] the synagogue of satan don't be fooled
[1:20:16] you won't be fooled if you are the very
[1:20:18] elect jesus said you
[1:20:20] can someone say amen you
[1:20:22] would not be fooled
[1:20:25] amen don't go around saying oh my i've
[1:20:28] gotta just i've gotta guard myself look
[1:20:31] there's a spirit in the land saying well
[1:20:33] you know we just got to be careful
[1:20:35] because we don't want anyone else
[1:20:36] contaminating this message and so we've
[1:20:39] got to guard this message i'm sorry
[1:20:41] that's what the holy ghost is for this
[1:20:43] true bride of christ filled with the
[1:20:45] holy ghost you can listen to any kind of
[1:20:47] preacher amen i preached in churches
[1:20:49] they believed the thunders and god was
[1:20:52] there south america and we're talking
[1:20:54] die hard thunder people and i don't take
[1:20:56] one drop of credit for this but i do
[1:20:58] know sister jerry and i was there
[1:21:00] die hard thunder people and when i first
[1:21:03] come to the pope say a few words have
[1:21:05] you guys ever been around thunders
[1:21:06] churches they jump up out of their chair
[1:21:08] and the whole church runs up in front of
[1:21:10] the pulpit and they're up here
[1:21:14] it's like
[1:21:16] and they're all like
[1:21:18] he's not shouting over us no i'm not
[1:21:20] going to
[1:21:21] that's not the message of the hour
[1:21:25] but when we were done preaching there
[1:21:27] because of the power of god
[1:21:29] the pastor himself come back to the
[1:21:31] minister that was
[1:21:34] kind of
[1:21:35] brought us there
[1:21:37] in a few short weeks after that time he
[1:21:38] called him up and said i've been wrong
[1:21:42] i've been wrong
[1:21:44] god forgive me now this is a true
[1:21:45] repentance he went to every single
[1:21:47] church and ministry and whatever that he
[1:21:49] had shunned through the years and
[1:21:51] repented in their pulpits before them in
[1:21:54] public
[1:21:55] you know what caused him to realize he
[1:21:57] was wrong
[1:22:00] special ministry
[1:22:02] no
[1:22:03] preaching of the word
[1:22:08] and there was a seed down inside of him
[1:22:12] but you realize as much as having their
[1:22:14] pastor say i've been teaching you wrong
[1:22:16] for nine years
[1:22:18] there are many of them split the church
[1:22:20] many of them said we like
[1:22:22] we like believing that our dancing our
[1:22:24] shouting our screaming is the evidence
[1:22:26] of the holy ghost
[1:22:28] we like that
[1:22:30] you see actually how shallow that is
[1:22:33] because anybody can jump and shout and
[1:22:35] scream anybody can rush from the back to
[1:22:37] the pulpit and jump up and down for 45
[1:22:39] minutes anybody can do that
[1:22:42] but it takes a real life
[1:22:45] yeah i know it just went through my
[1:22:46] sister jerry's mind she's like my
[1:22:48] husband's lost it because i was standing
[1:22:50] on the chairs in the front row of the
[1:22:51] church preaching to them
[1:22:54] but you know what i got in the spirit of
[1:22:56] the moment
[1:22:58] amen
[1:23:01] but you see jesus said you wouldn't be
[1:23:03] fooled
[1:23:04] so no amount of jumping shouting
[1:23:06] emotions none of that is going to take a
[1:23:09] true believer and draw them away
[1:23:12] oh some of us could use a little bit
[1:23:14] more
[1:23:15] some of us could actually you know have
[1:23:17] a little inspiration in church amen
[1:23:21] hallelujah
[1:23:22] now look at this i i lord forgive me for
[1:23:25] that i shouldn't say that we are all
[1:23:27] individuals and as god moves upon you
[1:23:30] amen i don't mean to say that
[1:23:32] it's just as the brother told me once he
[1:23:34] goes you know brother paul he said i
[1:23:36] found myself preaching about you know
[1:23:38] get your hands lifted up i want to hear
[1:23:39] a loud shout i want to hear an amen and
[1:23:42] he said
[1:23:43] i just realized you know
[1:23:46] that just helped me as an old man get
[1:23:48] excited about preaching but it didn't
[1:23:50] change the condition of the church
[1:23:52] and so he himself was like yeah they're
[1:23:54] saying amen preach it
[1:23:57] but it didn't change the church and
[1:23:58] finally he just let the people settle
[1:24:00] back down to where they was at and
[1:24:03] amen just preach something that would
[1:24:04] change the church
[1:24:06] hallelujah
[1:24:07] oh my
[1:24:10] you see
[1:24:11] we look at this my brother and sister
[1:24:12] and we realize how beautiful
[1:24:14] jesus said you wouldn't be fooled
[1:24:17] now that's something you know i i was
[1:24:19] not that long ago told by somebody that
[1:24:21] that was arrogant for me to preach from
[1:24:23] this pulpit that there was no way on
[1:24:25] earth we could be fooled they were like
[1:24:28] you know you can be deceived you can be
[1:24:29] deceived and i said no that's that's not
[1:24:31] right that's not what the word said the
[1:24:33] word said the devil's going to try and
[1:24:35] and through his vessels of men or
[1:24:37] ministry is going to try to deceive but
[1:24:39] it's not possible
[1:24:42] now if my god said it's not possible i'm
[1:24:45] not going to sit around fretting that it
[1:24:46] might happen amen and when he said all
[1:24:50] things are possible talking about the
[1:24:52] gospel and i'm going to sit here and say
[1:24:55] i have full confidence if i have a need
[1:24:57] you have a need god needs to speak it's
[1:25:00] going to happen
[1:25:01] amen i don't have to worry about is
[1:25:03] there going to be a church in nampa
[1:25:04] idaho on midland boulevard that's going
[1:25:06] to have the holy ghost the word says
[1:25:09] it's going to happen and i believe it's
[1:25:11] gonna happen amen we don't have to
[1:25:13] manufacture that
[1:25:14] we don't have to try to bring that about
[1:25:17] we don't have to do some kind of special
[1:25:21] thing
[1:25:23] now look
[1:25:27] it does seem striking
[1:25:29] to see a spirit become incarnate in one
[1:25:33] who was so close to the truth
[1:25:37] i want you to think about this so close
[1:25:40] to the truth walked with him supped with
[1:25:43] him
[1:25:44] heard him share the gospel
[1:25:47] it just it just strikes it but but you
[1:25:49] see god through these words was not only
[1:25:52] fulfilling the scripture of that day he
[1:25:54] was preparing us for our day
[1:25:57] he was preparing us for the time that we
[1:25:59] live in that we're not going to look and
[1:26:02] judge everything because this person's
[1:26:03] close to this person this person's best
[1:26:05] friends with this they've traveled
[1:26:07] they've been all around the world my
[1:26:08] brother and sister we have one
[1:26:10] relationship that matters and that is
[1:26:12] the relationship with our lord jesus
[1:26:14] christ and when we have that
[1:26:15] relationship satan can pry
[1:26:20] i just was in a business the other day
[1:26:23] as i'm walking up to open the door i
[1:26:24] looked at their door and almost from top
[1:26:27] to bottom you can tell somebody has put
[1:26:29] a crowbar
[1:26:30] on the door of this business and tried
[1:26:32] to pry it open they have ripped the
[1:26:35] metal separated the face of the metal
[1:26:37] all up and down the jamb and i made a
[1:26:40] comment and they said yeah they tried
[1:26:41] but they couldn't do it
[1:26:44] now don't think that when the word
[1:26:46] declared that you would not be deceived
[1:26:49] don't think the devil's not going to try
[1:26:52] he's going to pry on the door to your
[1:26:54] spirit he's going to pry on the door of
[1:26:56] your family he's going to beat on it
[1:26:59] he's going to try everything he can do
[1:27:01] but the word said he couldn't do it
[1:27:04] hallelujah so we sit back and say well
[1:27:07] why am i having this trial why is this
[1:27:09] happening the lord said yeah he said the
[1:27:12] devil wouldn't get the door open it
[1:27:14] didn't say he wouldn't try
[1:27:17] hallelujah
[1:27:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:21] now look here
[1:27:22] so the spirit become incarnate and one
[1:27:24] that was so close
[1:27:26] but you see now i'm going to take this
[1:27:28] back
[1:27:29] prophet of god said the true believer
[1:27:32] will say amen to every word of god
[1:27:36] now some of us
[1:27:38] are quiet worshipers
[1:27:40] i say this in all seriousness
[1:27:42] may never hear a vocal above the rest of
[1:27:45] the congregation amen
[1:27:48] but down in the heart
[1:27:50] down in the heart they're saying that's
[1:27:51] the word
[1:27:52] thank you lord for the word
[1:27:55] i love the word
[1:28:05] you see what happens is
[1:28:08] we
[1:28:09] as humans
[1:28:13] we have certain things that we put in
[1:28:15] place and
[1:28:17] we judge this you know as
[1:28:24] we build our own little hierarchy
[1:28:28] we build our own little castle
[1:28:34] now let's see
[1:28:36] i'm pretty sure i'm
[1:28:38] more spiritual than sister sue
[1:28:42] definitely more spiritual than this
[1:28:43] family of that family
[1:28:47] and the prophet come with these simple
[1:28:49] words
[1:28:50] that we should put more weight to
[1:28:52] and he said you'll be surprised
[1:28:55] is there
[1:28:57] and you'll be surprised who is not there
[1:29:02] you know that should be enough right
[1:29:04] there to cause us to back up and say
[1:29:06] lord i think i'm just going to look in
[1:29:07] the mirror of the word and worry about
[1:29:09] this guy right here
[1:29:11] because after all of my conclusions a
[1:29:14] prophet just said i'll probably get it
[1:29:16] wrong anyhow
[1:29:18] so i think i'll just work on being a
[1:29:20] good christian be the best i can be and
[1:29:22] you know what it says there that prayers
[1:29:24] covers a multitude of sins and lord i
[1:29:27] know that i probably have not repented
[1:29:29] over some things i thought did so lord
[1:29:31] i'm going to pray for the saints and
[1:29:33] lift them up and i'm not doing this
[1:29:34] mechanically but lord i believe it and i
[1:29:37] just know that in my life i need you to
[1:29:39] cover everything
[1:29:41] and suddenly the whole church
[1:29:43] you heard that deal about the sister
[1:29:46] decided that
[1:29:48] she'd just start praying
[1:29:50] the thing and
[1:29:54] she got down every day faithfully heard
[1:29:56] the evangelists say you know you need to
[1:29:58] be praying every day
[1:30:01] she took that to heart
[1:30:03] she liked the evangelist
[1:30:07] she prayed every day
[1:30:09] and after a week
[1:30:11] didn't seem like much happened couple
[1:30:12] weeks
[1:30:14] about a month
[1:30:16] she started looking out there and going
[1:30:18] well praise the lord
[1:30:21] god's working on sister so-and-so
[1:30:26] oh and our pastor
[1:30:27] he's preaching much deeper now
[1:30:32] without
[1:30:32] realizing the one god was working on
[1:30:36] was her
[1:30:40] now my brother and sister there's the
[1:30:41] choice we have to make
[1:30:44] to let
[1:30:46] the invisible
[1:30:47] become visible will not be us waiting it
[1:30:50] out
[1:30:52] it will be us acting on the word of god
[1:30:56] the invisible my brother and sister the
[1:30:58] word of god shows us will remain
[1:31:00] invisible to most of the earth
[1:31:04] but that we can sit here today and say
[1:31:06] thank you lord not from arrogance not
[1:31:08] from pride not from intellectual
[1:31:10] concepts but from something deep within
[1:31:13] the soul we can say thank you lord it is
[1:31:16] visible now amen now look i i just bring
[1:31:19] this out of the fourth seal it's just a
[1:31:21] reference here don't have a quote amen
[1:31:23] and uh brother branham says here now
[1:31:26] that uh he's done it again and she won't
[1:31:28] do it he's talking about the church
[1:31:29] paragraph 258 in the fourth seal amen
[1:31:33] 630321.
[1:31:34] he said now her rejection away makes her
[1:31:37] or her rejection makes a perfect way for
[1:31:40] satan to come into her and be incarnate
[1:31:43] that's right incarnate himself right in
[1:31:45] here in her because she rejected the
[1:31:48] word
[1:31:49] see there's that opening right there
[1:31:50] that comes we pull back from the word it
[1:31:53] leaves an opening for satan to step in
[1:31:56] and once he gets the foothold my brother
[1:31:58] and sister without a divine intervention
[1:32:00] from the holy spirit she is now speaking
[1:32:03] of the church consumed by that spirit
[1:32:06] amen now i had quite a few quotes please
[1:32:08] forgive me here this morning amen no i
[1:32:11] shouldn't say that this is a word amen
[1:32:13] this is the message jesus did the works
[1:32:15] of his father because the father was in
[1:32:17] him
[1:32:18] that is why the works was done because
[1:32:20] that the father was in the sun do you
[1:32:22] believe that now i want you to really
[1:32:24] focus on this because to me this is just
[1:32:26] powerful
[1:32:27] amen do you believe that that in him he
[1:32:29] was the incarnate god
[1:32:31] now we know this from john 1 right the
[1:32:33] word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us
[1:32:36] it shouldn't be i hope you know i've
[1:32:38] been on my heart we might just go back
[1:32:40] and preach godhead again my brother
[1:32:41] sister because just running many people
[1:32:44] and they have misconceptions
[1:32:45] misunderstandings about the godhead and
[1:32:48] where they fit in it they might
[1:32:49] recognize that the word was made flesh
[1:32:52] and dwelt among us but they don't
[1:32:53] recognize what that really means to them
[1:32:56] amen and if we don't recognize what it
[1:32:58] really means to us then we miss the
[1:33:00] whole crux of the point amen so do you
[1:33:04] believe that that in him he was the
[1:33:05] incarnate god do you believe that i do
[1:33:08] believe that that god the father which
[1:33:10] is the father of jesus christ the great
[1:33:12] spirit dwelt in the fullness of his
[1:33:14] power in jesus christ which was the
[1:33:17] tabernacle of god made flesh and dwelt
[1:33:19] on earth representing the word jesus was
[1:33:23] the word can we say amen the bible said
[1:33:26] so saint john first chapter and the word
[1:33:30] was invisible
[1:33:33] you see there's much more
[1:33:34] than in the beginning was the word
[1:33:39] and the fact that the word
[1:33:40] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:33:43] the invisible god
[1:33:46] is now
[1:33:48] made visible that's right amen my oh my
[1:33:51] oh my saints
[1:33:53] hallelujah oh i could go off on a
[1:33:55] tangent here but let me let me just stay
[1:33:58] and the word was invisible now listen
[1:34:00] close the word was invisible until it
[1:34:03] was made flesh and then the word become
[1:34:06] visible
[1:34:09] and through his sacrificial death at

[1:37:12] but by supernatural authority
[1:37:15] the word
[1:37:16] i hope you're with me now
[1:37:18] the word look look at all these comics
[1:37:20] and all this garbage they got people who
[1:37:22] look through walls and they do this and
[1:37:24] you know all of a sudden they rip their
[1:37:26] coat off or whatever and their superman
[1:37:28] spider-man this man or that man and
[1:37:31] whatever you realize all that is just an
[1:37:33] impersonation of the word of god amen
[1:37:36] that when you get beyond the outer layer
[1:37:39] oh there's somebody powerful in there
[1:37:42] there's somebody supernatural in there
[1:37:44] there's somebody that is almighty god
[1:37:46] incarnated it so once again
[1:37:50] it is not my brother and sister this
[1:37:52] flesh you notice i said those words on
[1:37:54] purpose it's the soul it's not this
[1:37:57] flesh this flesh is not the incarnate of
[1:38:00] god but it's this soul that is the
[1:38:03] incarnate of god it is his soul that is
[1:38:06] all-powerful and cannot be deceived it
[1:38:09] is his soul that can claim healing and
[1:38:11] claim lost loved ones and claim the holy
[1:38:14] ghost whoa

[1:38:19] look he's saying oh brother paul that's
[1:38:20] nice that's nice you're preaching good
[1:38:22] brother paul that's good amen could come
[1:38:24] into the individual and make the word
[1:38:26] visible
[1:38:27] look what brother brown says right here
[1:38:29] i wish my church could get that
[1:38:33] do you realize how blessed we are
[1:38:36] oh come on i don't mean to be
[1:38:37] controversial and i'm telling you right
[1:38:39] now if i had a choice to be sitting in
[1:38:41] the tabernacle in the 60s or be right
[1:38:44] here right now
[1:38:46] i have no doubt what i would choose
[1:38:49] no doubt what i would choose
[1:38:51] because you see that seed that was
[1:38:53] planted through that ministry had to
[1:38:56] come to fruition
[1:38:58] hallelujah we saw the seed and the glory
[1:39:01] of the seed that was planted but i love
[1:39:05] oh i love the harvest
[1:39:08] and we are the matured word coming into
[1:39:11] the harvest
[1:39:12] oh
[1:39:14] yes
[1:39:15] if you could see friends the invisible
[1:39:18] god
[1:39:19] made visible
[1:39:20] i tell you what
[1:39:22] you pray for me i'll pray for you i want
[1:39:24] to be so prayed through
[1:39:26] so prayed up that when i look at you all
[1:39:29] i see is christ
[1:39:30] and you say well you know if you guys
[1:39:32] will straighten up if you guys will live
[1:39:34] a higher life if you guys will do this
[1:39:36] if you guys will do that no it's up to
[1:39:38] me because if i am prayed up if i'm
[1:39:41] filled with the holy ghost your faults
[1:39:43] your flaws your shortcoming will
[1:39:46] disappear
[1:39:48] because i will see the invisible made
[1:39:50] visible in my midst
[1:39:54] too many times we're looking for someone
[1:39:56] else to raise to a standard
[1:40:00] but it's usually our standard amen
[1:40:02] it's usually what we think they ought to
[1:40:05] be
[1:40:08] are we doing okay
[1:40:10] okay praise the lord because i
[1:40:13] i wasn't going to preach very long i was
[1:40:14] going to be noon today
[1:40:16] and the clocks i don't know if it's
[1:40:18] magnetic force or something the clocks
[1:40:20] are messed up
[1:40:23] now look at this
[1:40:25] brother branham speaking on this
[1:40:27] the invisible god made invisible
[1:40:30] and now we're going to just come right
[1:40:31] along and look in the comforter
[1:40:34] there it is
[1:40:36] how long is he going to abide forever
[1:40:40] then what is the word of god
[1:40:44] that's it amen
[1:40:46] look at the world we have today
[1:40:47] neurotics everywhere
[1:40:50] people concerned uh nervous got problems
[1:40:54] marriages
[1:40:55] childre children raring all these things
[1:40:58] are just all in turmoil and it's like
[1:41:00] people are like oh i can't find any
[1:41:03] peace there's no peace in our home well
[1:41:05] let's just go to the prophet and see
[1:41:06] what the prophet of god said was where
[1:41:08] we find comfort let's see what the
[1:41:10] prophet of god said or what our comfort
[1:41:12] is today it's when we receive the
[1:41:14] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:16] amen you see we can't give as humans uh
[1:41:20] you can't give comfort to someone else
[1:41:22] in the sense the prophet is talking here
[1:41:24] we can comfort one another loss of a
[1:41:26] loved one loss of parent et cetera et
[1:41:28] cetera and you look at that and we can
[1:41:29] give comfort that is actually just
[1:41:32] filial comfort
[1:41:34] but that felio comfort has a season has
[1:41:36] an expiration date sister jerry and i
[1:41:38] doing a little grocery shopping
[1:41:39] yesterday and uh while we are not trying
[1:41:41] to turn into preppers or anything like
[1:41:43] that we have got tired of kind of living
[1:41:46] you know day to day so to speak grocery
[1:41:48] shopping and we're kind of filling up
[1:41:50] the pantry and we have a little space
[1:41:51] now that we didn't used to have and you
[1:41:53] know it's good right
[1:41:56] if the power goes out
[1:42:00] i mean if the power goes out we all have
[1:42:02] to rush to brother jason's sister emmy's
[1:42:03] house eat the ice cream before it melts
[1:42:07] but that won't do us very long beyond
[1:42:09] that
[1:42:11] so
[1:42:12] what do we have for comfort there
[1:42:16] now we've been looking my brother and
[1:42:17] sister
[1:42:19] that's storing our little pantry out in
[1:42:21] the garage those have been their
[1:42:23] little pantry looks like
[1:42:24] such a jerry come across a novel idea
[1:42:27] we ought to look at how long this is
[1:42:28] going to be before it expires
[1:42:31] oh look at this here this would be great
[1:42:33] if the power went out
[1:42:35] oh
[1:42:37] three months from now it's considered no
[1:42:39] good
[1:42:42] you know they even put expiration dates
[1:42:44] on canned food
[1:42:48] oh this is only good for six months
[1:42:55] let's look here forever what the prophet
[1:42:56] of god said now
[1:43:00] he put an expiration date on god didn't
[1:43:02] he
[1:43:04] some of you are shaking your head no but
[1:43:06] actually he did
[1:43:07] it's very much marked
[1:43:09] this is good
[1:43:10] forever
[1:43:14] he marked it for us saints
[1:43:15] he put an expiration date on the word of
[1:43:18] god good forever
[1:43:19] amen so if we receive the baptism of the
[1:43:22] holy ghost the power of god living in us
[1:43:25] then we have something that has no
[1:43:27] expiration date amen and that with the
[1:43:31] word of the living god we stand that
[1:43:33] word is made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:43:35] now that same word that was made flesh
[1:43:38] and dwelt among us has become
[1:43:41] our flesh
[1:43:43] look at this my brother and sister i can
[1:43:44] stand this morning and tell you in
[1:43:47] portion let's get this correct let's not
[1:43:49] lose our balance here in portion i am
[1:43:52] the incarnate god living here now
[1:43:56] amen we're not going to come and have
[1:43:58] some prophecy of this prophecy of that
[1:44:00] and we're infallible none of that
[1:44:03] nonsense we keep our balance but
[1:44:05] recognize that we have become the
[1:44:08] incarnate god in flesh in this
[1:44:11] generation the life of christ lived out
[1:44:14] hallelujah you know there's people
[1:44:17] around this beautiful message
[1:44:19] that would argue the socks off of you
[1:44:21] until you showed them this quote
[1:44:23] amen that's right
[1:44:25] i'm sorry they don't see it that way
[1:44:27] they still see us as sinners saved by
[1:44:30] grace
[1:44:32] oh wait some of you looked at me like
[1:44:34] that's what we are
[1:44:37] but you understand that god took us a
[1:44:39] step further that's right we recognize
[1:44:42] who we where we come from
[1:44:44] i am the son of david and geraldine
[1:44:46] haley take my ancestry going right on
[1:44:48] back my brother and sister i can focus
[1:44:50] on that i can focus on the mistakes i
[1:44:53] made or i can focus on the word that
[1:44:55] said before the foundation of the world
[1:44:58] before the foundation of the world paul
[1:45:01] i put you in this position put your name
[1:45:04] in there
[1:45:06] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:45:08] right
[1:45:09] amen that same word was made flesh that
[1:45:12] same word dwells in the church and you
[1:45:14] have to take this in context because the
[1:45:16] church is you
[1:45:18] amen don't think about four walls a roof
[1:45:22] therefore if we don't compromise that
[1:45:24] word we stay right with it if we don't
[1:45:26] compromise it that same word living in
[1:45:29] you will produce the same thing that it
[1:45:31] did when it was made flesh
[1:45:33] because your flesh
[1:45:35] holds it
[1:45:37] is that beautiful
[1:45:39] i hope it's encouraging to you amen we
[1:45:42] see the clear picture of where judas was
[1:45:44] at but satan deceived him because
[1:45:47] actually the very thing you can find
[1:45:50] this in the message i don't have it
[1:45:51] right here to give you but the very
[1:45:53] thing brother branham said now eve was
[1:45:56] looking
[1:45:57] how does that go jerry
[1:45:59] eve was looking
[1:46:01] for something more
[1:46:03] or new
[1:46:05] new
[1:46:07] and satan made sure she found it
[1:46:11] i'm not looking for something new
[1:46:12] i'm looking for what i was already
[1:46:14] promised to be what you were already
[1:46:16] promised to be we're not looking for
[1:46:18] something different amen satan won't
[1:46:20] deceive you and get you to run out after
[1:46:22] something because you recognize who you
[1:46:25] are in jesus christ amen and when we
[1:46:28] realize my brother and sister that god
[1:46:30] made us the bride of christ in such a
[1:46:33] fashion that this word living in us has
[1:46:36] to we couldn't i don't mean to change
[1:46:38] the prophet's words but we could change
[1:46:39] that and not be out of contact it has to
[1:46:43] hallelujah it has to produce the same
[1:46:47] thing
[1:46:48] it not it might or it could it's a
[1:46:50] remote possibility but the word said it
[1:46:53] has to produce this
[1:46:57] same thing you did when it was made
[1:46:59] flesh because your flesh
[1:47:07] in the flesh you could
[1:47:10] let me just speak to the carnal man for
[1:47:12] a moment
[1:47:13] in your flesh
[1:47:15] you could come to the place you'd be
[1:47:16] anointed to say
[1:47:18] if god's in me
[1:47:19] where is he at
[1:47:25] come on
[1:47:27] you know how it is
[1:47:29] driving to church
[1:47:32] out of the blue i'll just use sister
[1:47:34] jerry and
[1:47:34] i this may or may not represent a true
[1:47:38] story
[1:47:42] driving to church
[1:47:47] wife
[1:47:49] you remember 11 days 3 hours 46 seconds
[1:47:51] ago you said this
[1:47:57] i did
[1:47:58] you did
[1:48:00] honey we're on the way to church
[1:48:02] i don't care i just remembered
[1:48:06] i don't mind and then it just
[1:48:09] these imaginary people
[1:48:12] temperature in the car
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:15] get to church
[1:48:17] walk inside meet the deacon at the door
[1:48:20] god bless you
[1:48:26] that couldn't possibly
[1:48:29] be the word made flesh could it
[1:48:37] but i'm here to tell you it is
[1:48:41] the devil anointing
[1:48:43] doing his very best because he says man
[1:48:45] if i don't do this now they'll get in
[1:48:47] the house of god and their soul will
[1:48:50] just get a little more liberated than it
[1:48:52] was yesterday and i'm already afraid of
[1:48:54] them
[1:48:57] so what does he do he anoints flesh
[1:49:00] leave the flesh at the door so to speak
[1:49:03] come in
[1:49:05] because we're hungering we're thirsting
[1:49:06] after righteousness because it's the
[1:49:09] soul god's feeding
[1:49:10] not the flesh
[1:49:12] amen the invisible
[1:49:15] has been
[1:49:17] made visible amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:21] look
[1:49:22] my brother and sister the word's not
[1:49:23] getting any weaker
[1:49:25] the word is getting more powerful and if
[1:49:28] you think about this oh some people
[1:49:30] would almost call it blasphemy but if
[1:49:31] you think about how powerful the word
[1:49:33] was when the prophet was standing on the
[1:49:35] word of god think about how powerful the
[1:49:38] maturity of the word is
[1:49:40] this bride coming into her rightful
[1:49:42] position is not going to set back as a
[1:49:45] weakling
[1:49:47] she's not going to sit back as woe unto
[1:49:49] me now we do that don't we
[1:49:52] not you but people like you
[1:49:54] they do that
[1:49:56] but let's break that
[1:49:58] let's break that
[1:49:59] because the word is becoming more
[1:50:01] powerful what it is my brother and
[1:50:02] sister as you get
[1:50:04] our sister is a doctor she knows about
[1:50:06] these things you get a little infection
[1:50:08] it doesn't just you do nothing about it
[1:50:11] it doesn't just stay in your finger
[1:50:14] no sir it spreads it works its way right
[1:50:16] up through the system
[1:50:18] and oh i hope you catch this analogy
[1:50:20] it works it's all the way up
[1:50:23] to the heart
[1:50:24] well praise the lord
[1:50:26] the lord has come
[1:50:28] and he has infected you with his word
[1:50:32] and it has worked its way through us
[1:50:35] worked its way through our temper
[1:50:36] tantrums it's worked its way through
[1:50:38] every aspect of our life and it come
[1:50:40] down here now into the resting place of
[1:50:43] the heart of the soul and now we are
[1:50:45] there in satan saying you're not a
[1:50:47] believer you're not this you're not that
[1:50:50] and you can say yes i know i am
[1:50:53] because i have been there
[1:50:56] this is my testimony this is my
[1:50:58] experience sister amy would you come
[1:51:00] please musicians
[1:51:02] hallelujah
[1:51:03] amen this word is not getting weaker
[1:51:05] saints and neither shall the bride
[1:51:07] because she is the word
[1:51:10] made flesh
[1:51:12] in this generation
[1:51:13] hallelujah
[1:51:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:18] oh thank you lord
[1:51:21] um thank you lord
[1:51:23] where would we be saints
[1:51:25] where would we be
[1:51:27] if it wasn't for god's grace in this
[1:51:29] generation
[1:51:30] amen
[1:51:32] well we'd have a lot of options you know
[1:51:35] might have been catholic
[1:51:39] might have been
[1:51:40] mormon
[1:51:42] might have been nazarene might have been
[1:51:44] methodist
[1:51:45] so that was a journey our parents and
[1:51:47] grandparents etc took
[1:51:50] throw in bible missionary from my
[1:51:52] grandma
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:55] but god said you know what i'm leading
[1:51:57] you
[1:51:58] you my chosen
[1:52:00] amen i won't go back and take you back
[1:52:02] to that verse right but he said i know
[1:52:04] who i've chosen
[1:52:06] amen so he says you know what i don't
[1:52:08] care what the roots of the family are
[1:52:11] i've chose you
[1:52:13] and i brought you into this state of
[1:52:16] holy matrimony
[1:52:18] my brother and sister
[1:52:20] this closing remark
[1:52:23] people
[1:52:24] are looking for a
[1:52:27] marriage ceremony
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:31] now this is you know complicated for
[1:52:34] some folks
[1:52:36] but you see the scripture shows us so
[1:52:38] clearly
[1:52:40] the vow
[1:52:42] is where the obligation lies
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] it's not the tuxedo the nice dress

[1:57:28] you i skipped over a couple things but i
[1:57:31] just want to reiterate
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:34] the word incarnate
[1:57:36] is just as valuable
[1:57:38] to a believer
[1:57:40] as it was destructive
[1:57:43] to the unbelief
[1:57:45] hallelujah
[1:57:46] don't let the devil say well well i
[1:57:48] don't know about this you see my brother
[1:57:50] and sister unless the very life and
[1:57:52] spirit of christ
[1:57:53] comes down and dwells inside here
[1:57:57] we're just another denomination
[1:58:00] but when that power comes down and
[1:58:01] dwells inside of here we become that
[1:58:05] living word
[1:58:06] hallelujah
[1:58:08] predestinated for this generation
[1:58:11] now remember the prophet messenger come
[1:58:13] aren't we glad
[1:58:15] but do you realize
[1:58:17] oh my
[1:58:18] there are several quotes they fit
[1:58:20] together hand in glove
[1:58:22] but do you realize by the prophet's own
[1:58:24] words he said there'll come a day that
[1:58:26] i'll be gone from the scene
[1:58:29] that'll hand
[1:58:30] this off
[1:58:33] hallelujah saints think about it
[1:58:35] and there was a bride waiting there just
[1:58:38] as it would be like the relay racer
[1:58:41] we're waiting there oh here comes the
[1:58:43] word thank you lord the life of the word
[1:58:46] and it's handed to us and we run
[1:58:49] our race
[1:58:50] and if the lord tarries
[1:58:52] we'll hand it off and even if he doesn't
[1:58:55] we have the privilege to hand it to
[1:58:58] friends
[1:58:59] loved ones sons daughters husbands wives
[1:59:03] look how beautiful this
[1:59:05] that the word would remain visible

[1:59:12] and tear into this okay i have staked
[1:59:14] this
[1:59:20] i don't know about that
[1:59:22] but my brother and sister
[1:59:25] this visible word
[1:59:28] has to remain visible
[1:59:31] to the next generation
[1:59:34] you see if we fail we fall down we come
[1:59:37] short if we don't feel worthy i want you
[1:59:39] to think about all the things that satan
[1:59:41] tells you if we listen to him
[1:59:45] then
[1:59:46] this will not be carried
[1:59:48] to another generation
[1:59:50] if we become a denomination
[1:59:54] the living word will not be made
[1:59:56] visible to another generation you see
[1:59:59] how important it is that you and i look
[2:00:01] at the word recognize the word claim the
[2:00:03] word and proclaim the word
[2:00:06] because then our children will actually
[2:00:09] say

[2:00:11] think i'm going to serve the lord now
