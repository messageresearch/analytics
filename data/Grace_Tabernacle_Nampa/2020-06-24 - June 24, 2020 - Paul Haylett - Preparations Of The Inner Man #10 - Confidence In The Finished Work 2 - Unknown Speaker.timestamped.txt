[26:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed
[26:51] be the name of the Lord hallelujah
[26:55] hallelujah I just want to say this
[26:58] evening now sometimes things slip our
[27:00] mind we just want to lift up our brother
[27:05] Isaac before the Lord this coming Friday
[27:11] he is scheduled to have a throat surgery
[27:16] they're going to go in there and take
[27:20] his tonsils and whatever out because
[27:25] he's just been having struggles they
[27:27] they did a sleep test I don't know if he
[27:29] shared this he probably didn't they did
[27:31] a sleep test and I don't remember the
[27:34] exact numbers but it was an astounding
[27:36] amount of times that he would stop
[27:39] breathing every night and the doctor
[27:42] said that sometimes the gap would be
[27:45] long enough they said that that would
[27:49] almost be enough for you just to stop
[27:51] breathing forever and so we just want to
[27:54] lift him up before the Lord they you
[27:58] know part of it I hope this doesn't
[28:01] sound bad but sometimes you know the
[28:05] doctor said we can give you a CPAP and
[28:08] brother Isaac said to cut on me he
[28:13] didn't want to have to spend every night
[28:14] the rest of his life you know or
[28:16] believing Lord would healing but to have
[28:18] this machine that goes our sister
[28:24] Dorothy
[28:26] oh I love her Amen sister Joanne's
[28:33] sister she's been many times to the
[28:35] church here an absolute sweetheart maybe
[28:39] I love her for the wrong reasons but she
[28:41] I never see her but what she's right
[28:44] there telling me brother Paul keep
[28:46] pressing on preach it
[28:48] don't don't veer from it stand on it be
[28:51] faithful she's always just speaking to
[28:54] me in that fashion and and we just want
[28:57] to lift her up before the Lord we were
[28:59] trying to figure out how to correctly
[29:00] pronounce that but her artery right here
[29:03] is carotid is is plugged I think was it
[29:09] 60% and so she had kind of you might say
[29:12] a mild stroke from that or no stroke
[29:17] wonderful amen praise the Lord lift our
[29:21] sister up before the Lord so amen thank
[29:26] you Lord and we want to remember brother
[29:30] Alex sister Ullaeus brother brother Alex
[29:34] will be driving this coming weekend
[29:37] leaving I believe Friday and traveling
[29:41] out west it's been a little bit of a
[29:45] process brother Alex has as you know
[29:51] voiced for quite some time
[29:53] his desire to come to Idaho and he's a
[29:58] young man of great faith determination
[30:02] and so let's remember him also in prayer
[30:05] so our brother Isaac our sister Dorothy
[30:08] our brother Alex and and I was just
[30:10] texting a little bit with brother Sergey
[30:12] he's in Wyoming headed west so just keep
[30:18] him in your prayers amen amen
[30:21] well with this thank the Lord you know I
[30:23] want to speak to you once again on
[30:25] preparations of the inner man now my
[30:27] brother and sister we can do a lot to
[30:29] take care of the outer man as we have
[30:30] spoke before we can take him to the
[30:33] fitness center we can give him vitamins
[30:35] we can get him to exercise and all of
[30:37] that's good we won't we won't speak ill
[30:39] of those things
[30:40] amen but what is the true importance as
[30:45] we know is what preparation we give the
[30:47] inner man and when the inner man is
[30:50] prepared well the Lord will take care of
[30:52] the outer man amen now you know I love
[30:55] this and and forgive my humor tonight
[30:57] but I remember one time brother Donny
[31:00] just kind of speaking out to a situation
[31:04] and he said you know people come and you
[31:08] know they say oh I I have this issue
[31:10] brother Donny would you pray for me and
[31:12] brother Donny says and of course that's
[31:14] our job as ministry we pray for them and
[31:17] we believe God will touch them but he
[31:19] says you have to leave the Pepsi and the
[31:21] Cheetos and the chips and that other
[31:23] stuff alone amen so don't be eating
[31:26] those and then go to church and say pray
[31:28] for me amen so we have a responsibility
[31:31] to take care of this vessel and and we
[31:33] just believe the Lord knows our hearts
[31:37] and takes care of it let's stand to the
[31:39] reading of the word we'll go to 2nd
[31:41] Timothy amen
[31:42] I want to just continue kind of my
[31:44] thought on confidence in the finished
[31:46] work now as we spoke to you last week my
[31:51] brother and sister when we have
[31:52] confidence that brings trust now we
[31:57] understand that trust is often time
[31:59] based upon relationship right if you've
[32:02] come to a complete stranger you might
[32:05] have a more difficult time to trust them
[32:07] but you know there's been many times
[32:09] that God has allowed complete strangers
[32:12] to to do things in our lives and
[32:15] somewhere along the line we have to
[32:18] believe that God is in control and so as
[32:22] we look to what God is doing in our life
[32:24] we have to start trusting him and we see
[32:28] now that trust and confidence are tied
[32:30] together and Trust confidence and faith
[32:33] are all of the same vein amen so you
[32:37] can't say I have faith but you don't
[32:38] trust God you can't say I have
[32:40] confidence but you won't trust or you
[32:43] won't have faith so those really go down
[32:46] this same vein and now we have in the
[32:48] natural we have a certain degree of
[32:50] faith confidence trust how many of you
[32:54] well
[32:55] hopefully nobody's driving a car like
[32:56] that but how many of you tonight
[32:58] just got in your car you put the key in
[33:00] the ignition you didn't think twice
[33:02] right
[33:03] you didn't say oh I hope this will start
[33:06] at different times of our lives we've
[33:08] driven cars like that but there's just
[33:12] an innate value in humanity that we are
[33:16] shocked when it fails when we turn the
[33:20] key and nothing happens we're shocked in
[33:22] fact I've helped people on the side of
[33:25] the highway before and you know just you
[33:29] pass them in the semi and they're in the
[33:32] middle of nowhere and you think that is
[33:34] not good looks like a you know when I
[33:37] say young that's relevant young woman
[33:39] children in the car they're 40 or 50
[33:42] miles from any kind of services and you
[33:45] just can't bring yourself to keep
[33:47] driving and so you pull over and I've
[33:49] walked almost a half a mile back up the
[33:51] freeway before to help people and you
[33:53] walk up there and the lady's sitting in
[33:56] the car continually turning the key
[33:58] hearing this Illinois going click click
[34:01] click and getting weaker and I and she
[34:03] wouldn't roll the window down but I
[34:04] finally convinced her ma'am the car is
[34:07] not going to start so you need help and
[34:10] she's like well there-there's no
[34:13] services here and I said I know so
[34:15] you're gonna have to just allow someone
[34:17] else to help you and you know they they
[34:20] have a hard time hard time to unlock the
[34:23] door hard time to allow someone to to
[34:26] have interaction with them and it's
[34:30] there because there's a fear so as sons
[34:34] and daughters of God if we will not
[34:36] trust God then ultimately down somewhere
[34:40] in the midst of all of that there's a
[34:41] fear there is a doubt there is something
[34:45] hindering and so my brother and sister
[34:48] sometimes what we got to do is not sit
[34:50] here and preach about you must have
[34:52] faith you must have high faith you must
[34:53] have faith we need to stop and examine
[34:56] our life go back what is it we're afraid
[35:00] of
[35:01] when we figure out what it is we're
[35:03] afraid of
[35:04] now sometimes we're afraid because we
[35:06] were taught at some stage in our life we
[35:09] were taught to fear God not with
[35:11] reverence but with actual fear and I
[35:15] have encountered in times churches that
[35:19] were actually afraid of their pastor now
[35:23] my brother and sister how are you going
[35:25] to grow and move forward when you are
[35:28] afraid of where this is going
[35:31] what is going to happen is he preaching
[35:33] truth or is he not well do you know that
[35:36] that's really not the pastor's fault if
[35:39] you don't know whether he's preaching
[35:40] truth or not are you with me because we
[35:44] have laid at our fingertips every
[35:47] reference and every bit of the Bible we
[35:52] have all of that at our fingertips but
[35:55] what we have beyond that is the fact
[35:58] we've been given an unction the prophet
[36:01] of God spoke this and it should register
[36:03] with us that we can pray for revelation
[36:06] and our revelations not just oh I feel
[36:10] it in my heart right now I don't mean to
[36:13] speak ill but the the LDS the Mormons
[36:16] say well if you feel a burning in your
[36:19] in your heart or you know in your chest
[36:22] now that's a sign of the Holy Ghost my
[36:25] brother and sister that is not you will
[36:27] not find anywhere in there the scripture
[36:30] says that our hearts are not to be
[36:32] trusted our hearts are deceitful amen
[36:36] a scripture teaches us that it's not by
[36:39] education or theology that we confirm
[36:42] that but the scripture shows us that it
[36:45] is that personal relationship you
[36:47] praying for revelation praying for the
[36:51] Holy Ghost praying for this and God
[36:54] coming down and confirming it not with
[36:57] how we feel but by his word amen let's
[37:02] turn in second Timothy the first chapter
[37:05] verses 7 through 14 sorry to keep you
[37:08] standing amen
[37:13] want to take a little bit of this just
[37:17] as foundational as we move forward you
[37:19] know sometimes the things that we think
[37:24] are common or have become common to us
[37:26] actually contain a great measure of
[37:30] benefit when we fully understand what
[37:32] we're reading and Timothy the first
[37:34] chapters seventh verse for God hath not
[37:38] given us the spirit of fear so first off
[37:42] listen well let me just read the
[37:44] scripture and not keep you standing for
[37:46] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[37:48] but of power and of love and of a sound
[37:51] mind be not thou therefore ashamed of
[37:54] the testimony of our Lord nor of me his
[37:57] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[38:00] afflictions of the Gospel according to
[38:03] the power of God who hath saved us not a
[38:07] question mark a statement who has saved
[38:11] us and called us with an holy calling
[38:15] not according to our works and I have to
[38:18] say thank you Lord but according to his
[38:20] own purpose and grace which was given us
[38:23] in Christ Jesus before the world began
[38:26] oh my but is now made manifest so
[38:30] started before the world amen but now is
[38:33] being revealed thank you Lord by the
[38:37] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who
[38:40] hath abolished death and hath brought
[38:43] life and immortality to light through
[38:45] the gospel where until I am appointed a
[38:48] preacher an apostle and a teacher of the
[38:50] Gentiles for the which cause I also
[38:53] suffer these things nevertheless I am
[38:56] not ashamed for I know who I am I have
[39:00] believed now when I take this and just
[39:02] make an emphasis for a minute he knows
[39:05] whom he has believed not heard of not
[39:09] been told about knows amen personal
[39:14] relationship amen
[39:21] from know whom I have believed and am
[39:24] persuaded that he is able to keep all
[39:26] keep that which I have committed unto
[39:29] him against that day hold fast the form
[39:32] of sound words which thou has heard of
[39:35] me in faith and love which is in Christ
[39:38] Jesus that good thing which was
[39:40] committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[39:42] Ghost which dwelleth in us Heavenly
[39:46] Father we ask for your blessings upon
[39:47] the word tonight father for those that
[39:50] are part of the body Lord our brothers
[39:52] our sisters Lord unable to be here
[39:55] tonight working or whatever the
[39:56] circumstance might be father we just
[39:59] send your Holy Spirit out to each and
[40:00] every one lord give us unction father
[40:03] give us a rejoicing in our hearts and
[40:05] soul Lord to know that we have been
[40:08] called and Lord you have provided Lord
[40:11] we thank you for this in the name of
[40:12] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I
[40:22] want to just start there in verse seven
[40:24] and just touch on a few things quite
[40:26] quickly we move forward for God hath not
[40:29] given us the spirit of fear now remember
[40:32] one of the greatest gifts brother
[40:34] branham speaks about that God would give
[40:36] us salvation as a great gift amen giving
[40:39] the Holy Ghost to us is a groupie rrett
[40:42] of oppression coming down you know that
[40:44] there was and finally I almost called
[40:47] the radio station myself amen but
[40:50] finally there was a man come on and said
[40:51] well I don't know what's gonna happen
[40:53] with everybody else but we have my wife
[40:56] and I have charted a course we have set
[40:59] a deal we have set ourself in a position
[41:01] that we will not be afraid we are not
[41:04] going to be controlled by fear we are
[41:06] living our lives our life is too short
[41:07] anyhow we will not give it up to this
[41:10] kind of a thing and and you know the
[41:12] radio commentator kind of I think
[41:15] playing as it were the devil's advocate
[41:17] said well what if and the guy said I
[41:19] don't care about your what if Amen
[41:22] hallelujah well my brother and sister
[41:24] what if the devil is roaring like a lion
[41:27] tonight Amen he can't get into our
[41:30] position because our sanctuary is in
[41:33] Jesus Christ
[41:34] and if he could defeat that then it's
[41:37] all a lost call but the Word of God has
[41:39] showed us and it is clearly proven that
[41:42] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[41:43] and they believer a man sanctified amen
[41:47] justified sanctified washed in the blood
[41:50] it's in that strong tower and Satan
[41:54] cannot get into him amen so we are not
[41:57] going to be controlled by the spirit of
[41:59] fear we have questions
[42:00] amen I think it's fair to have questions
[42:03] brother Branham in several places says
[42:05] well I don't know you know this is not
[42:07] exact words but I don't know about
[42:08] tomorrow I don't know what will happen I
[42:11] don't know what's going to happen with
[42:12] my ministry but my brother and sister
[42:15] you didn't seem throw his hands up and
[42:17] say well if the devil will allow he
[42:19] always said Lord willing hey man it has
[42:22] nothing to do with Satan willing the
[42:24] devil willing amen all of Hell willing
[42:27] it's what the Lord said Amen Lord
[42:29] willing hallelujah
[42:31] so it's lair as we put into this we have
[42:33] not been given the spirit of fear if
[42:36] fear is on our doorstep if fear is in
[42:38] our home fear is in our mind my brother
[42:40] and sister it's time right now we don't
[42:42] need another time we stop right now and
[42:45] say Lord spirit of fear away from me
[42:48] Amen people I don't know will I have a
[42:50] job I thought it was interesting after
[42:52] all the city or the state of New York
[42:54] has been through I'm thinking was the
[42:56] city you know and they're recovering and
[42:58] and their mayor and their governor have
[43:01] made these statements that are just so
[43:02] outlandish you know God didn't have any
[43:05] part of this we did this ourself and all
[43:07] of this stuff and now right when they're
[43:09] talking about we're gonna have a
[43:11] recovery they make an announcement that
[43:13] probably probably this fall they'll have
[43:17] to layoff 20,000 municipal workers what
[43:23] is it another spirit of fear they've
[43:28] removed God from the equation they're
[43:31] filling the void with fear now my
[43:34] brother and sister you know what will
[43:36] happen every municipal worker that
[43:39] thinks his job might be at risk I'll go
[43:43] into a state of absolute fear
[43:47] and if you don't think that they won't
[43:49] make their co-workers look bad to look
[43:51] good to keep their own job it is now
[43:54] they'll start being cannibals and
[43:55] feeding upon one another pushing each
[43:58] other so to speak under the bus because
[44:00] well I've got a mortgage I need it more
[44:03] than they do and it's there but my
[44:04] brother and sister why would you
[44:06] announce it probably will have to lay
[44:08] all these people off when they're
[44:10] talking months and months and months in
[44:12] advance what they should do is say you
[44:13] know what we might all ought to tighten
[44:15] our belt or not and we might all need to
[44:17] just be as efficient as we can be but we
[44:20] can press forward and overcome this
[44:21] instead they offer up to the people the
[44:24] platter of fear oh my my brother and
[44:27] sister that will be a recipe straight
[44:29] out of the pits of hell amen well I'll
[44:32] tell you sometimes we we hear some of
[44:34] the preaching different people different
[44:36] avenues and they're they're preaching
[44:38] fear to their church amen you know look
[44:41] my brother and sister I'm sorry to just
[44:43] be kind of blunt but the devil and I
[44:45] aren't getting along lately we've been
[44:46] fussing quite a bit him and hey man he's
[44:49] been trying to do things and I've been
[44:51] kicking him in the teeth and I can't you
[44:53] know I just keep stomping on his fingers
[44:55] and you know you just get kind of a
[44:56] certain attitude about that you know you
[44:58] see some of them old slimy fingers
[45:00] creeping up over you might say the
[45:02] window seal there and I'm just keep
[45:04] chopping him off hey man I'm just tired
[45:06] of dealing with him I'm tired of talking
[45:08] to him I'm tired of dealing with the
[45:10] aftermath of what he's done when he
[45:11] comes tearing through there ain't man so
[45:13] you look at this the spirit of fear I'm
[45:15] sorry I won't embrace am I'm gonna stand
[45:18] up on this very verse right here ought
[45:20] to be enough to fundamentally put us in
[45:23] a position to claim every promise of God
[45:25] amen we should be able to claim every
[45:28] position that God has given right off of
[45:30] this via verse right here because he's
[45:32] not giving us can we say he's not giving
[45:34] me hey man he's not giving me the spirit
[45:37] of fear but he's given me Amen what is
[45:41] it in context now look I've out
[45:43] basically flunked out of school I'm not
[45:44] the brightest boy maybe we can put this
[45:46] in context he has not given me the
[45:48] spirit of fear so we're talking about
[45:50] giving is actually I don't have the
[45:52] right words for it but that's really
[45:53] what the the context of this coming down
[45:55] he gave a gift what was the gift it
[45:58] wasn't fear but it was of power
[46:01] hey man he gave me a gift of power oh
[46:04] we're not a church to sit back and say
[46:07] you know what I just hope and maybe this
[46:09] and maybe that I got a child not serving
[46:11] God a husband not serving God a wife not
[46:13] serving God whatever it might be and I
[46:15] and I hope know my brother and sister
[46:17] not of fear Amen but of power he gave me
[46:20] a gift he gave me a gift gave me a gift
[46:22] of power now the prophet of God we have
[46:25] to clarify this amen
[46:26] not just go off thinking we got the
[46:28] prophet of God said we don't actually
[46:30] have the power we've been given the
[46:32] authority to take the power of God and
[46:36] put it to work Amen well my brother and
[46:39] sister if you have the power you have to
[46:41] maintain it but if you just have
[46:43] authority to use the power then God
[46:46] Himself is obligated to maintain the
[46:48] power are you with me amen and he says
[46:51] he's also given us a gift of love
[46:55] hallelujah you know how hard that can be
[46:57] sometimes come on doesn't feel like love
[47:05] when you slap somebody silly doesn't
[47:10] feel like love when you you're tense and
[47:12] you're struggling and all kinds of
[47:14] things are happening around you and all
[47:16] right are you with me
[47:17] amen but you know I just shared with you
[47:21] I should included this I thought about
[47:22] it but you know we just shared with you
[47:24] in a previous service here and that God
[47:27] would chasing us or right but didn't he
[47:31] say I chasing those I love Amen
[47:35] sometimes getting whooped on and getting
[47:37] shook up a little bit and having oh I
[47:39] hope you get this oh I should have took
[47:41] that message book sister Geri just
[47:43] shared with me it's going to sidetrack
[47:45] me and it just did but my brother and
[47:47] sister
[47:48] not just her sister Geri hem that to me
[47:50] amen I've got to read that and let me
[47:53] find that portion right here amen clean
[47:57] my lamp Lord let me make sure it's got
[47:59] oil let me make sure it's trimmed Lord
[48:02] because I'm not going to miss this amen
[48:05] so as we look at this and realize what
[48:07] God is doing he is causing us to come
[48:10] into a place that we are now shifting
[48:13] from the thing
[48:14] of this earth the focus of this earth
[48:16] Amen now verse 12 he says for which
[48:19] cause I also suffer these things
[48:21] nevertheless I'm not ashamed for I know
[48:24] whom I have believed so whatever this
[48:27] suffering that took place did not bring
[48:30] you no it's like to say well I'm an
[48:32] overcomer and be going through the
[48:34] hardest trial of your life the world out
[48:36] here says now how can you say you are an
[48:39] overcomer
[48:40] you are victorious and you're going
[48:42] through great physical problems great
[48:44] mental problems great financial problems
[48:47] maybe even some spiritual problem but my
[48:49] brother and sister whatever it is where
[48:52] the Christian I was visiting for a few
[48:53] minutes last night it's whatever and
[48:55] this is proven my brother and sister not
[48:57] just a prophets quote but my brother's
[48:59] sister whatever you confess Amen is what
[49:02] you will ultimately take a whole tub if
[49:04] you keep telling yourself that you're
[49:06] stupid you're foolish you're this you're
[49:08] that you're weak whatever it is you will
[49:10] find yourself manifesting that position
[49:13] that's why the prophet of God told us
[49:15] what you need to do is not speak the
[49:17] devil's language you need to stand up
[49:19] and say I'm a good Christian I'm filled
[49:21] with the Holy Ghost
[49:22] I'm an overcomer because ultimately that
[49:24] will propel you into claiming that
[49:27] position if you say a failure oh I'll
[49:30] tell you away too many brothers and
[49:31] sisters sitting around you know and they
[49:33] look at things in their life and they
[49:34] say well I'm a failure well my brother's
[49:36] sister you say that enough and you will
[49:38] manifest the desire and the expression
[49:41] of a failure but if you all set there
[49:43] regardless I don't care you know as it
[49:46] is that you fell a fell on your face got
[49:48] mud on your face if you'll stand up and
[49:50] say Lord forgive me I am a son of God I
[49:53] am a daughter of God and you move
[49:56] forward my brother and sister well the
[49:58] word says he didn't do it because of
[50:00] your works so why would you halfway
[50:03] through the journey start measuring it
[50:04] by your works hey man I'm not talking
[50:07] about these people that are like praise
[50:08] the Lord I smoke drugs and I do this and
[50:11] I drink and I dance and I whatever but
[50:13] I'm a Christian now there's going to be
[50:14] a life to back it there's going to be an
[50:17] evidence that backs it up but don't let
[50:19] the devil short-circuit you halfway
[50:21] through and you start looking at your
[50:22] works trying to measure it up to it
[50:24] amen hallelujah now as we look at the
[50:27] word
[50:27] my brother and sister look at these
[50:29] promises that he has promised to us amen
[50:31] but we want to look at what he's not
[50:33] giving us and I want to go right back to
[50:35] the first verse here and as this
[50:37] reference and then we'll move on I want
[50:39] you to look at what he hasn't promised
[50:41] us he hasn't promised us that we would
[50:45] have a spirit of fear
[50:46] he hasn't promised us that would be
[50:48] powerless he hasn't promised us that we
[50:51] would have no love he hasn't promised us
[50:54] than our mind now you see that's one of
[50:58] the things that our nation people are
[51:00] struggling with right now it's a great
[51:02] big argument people are angry over the
[51:04] sound mind talking about mental illness
[51:06] my brother and sister we are not exempt
[51:09] right the Old Testament tells us that
[51:11] happens to the rich and the poor and the
[51:12] righteous and the unrighteous but we
[51:14] don't have to accept Satan's verdict hey
[51:18] man that's the difference the Bride of
[51:19] Christ does not have to accept Satan's
[51:21] verdict and we can come and we can
[51:23] struggle in the flesh and some people
[51:25] they just get to a nervous they don't
[51:27] want to talk about it but my brother and
[51:29] sister now remember being a sound our
[51:32] unsound you might say mental illness is
[51:34] a more beautiful thing oh yeah beautiful
[51:37] brother Paul I don't understand well you
[51:39] could have a heart full of fear amen
[51:42] you might be troubled on one side but
[51:44] believe the word of God you'll believe
[51:46] yourself brother wrong Spencer I love
[51:48] brother Ron's position he's there he's
[51:51] actually preached some services he's
[51:53] pressing forward he has good days he had
[51:55] bad days but he'll lean right over the
[51:57] pulpit and will declare to the people
[51:59] I'm going to preach myself right into a
[52:02] deliverance now the new me I'm not going
[52:05] to sit on the couch sit on a chair sit
[52:07] under a bench under a tree and go woe is
[52:09] me so I'm gonna preach myself right into
[52:12] a healing I'm gonna preach myself right
[52:15] into a deliverance
[52:16] come on preachers come on preachers come
[52:20] on family amen we can speak ourselves
[52:23] right into it because he didn't promise
[52:25] that these things would be absent from
[52:27] us he promised that these things would
[52:29] be given to us we can kick the spirit of
[52:32] fear out we can claim the spirit of love
[52:34] and of power and of a sound mind
[52:37] hallelujah this is the word this is
[52:39] God's promise to us
[52:41] now I hope that's not too blunt to you
[52:43] some people like I said get nervous
[52:45] about that but my brother and sister I'm
[52:47] telling you it's time with overall the
[52:50] sugar-coated it's time we get all the
[52:52] frosting off a man a good frosting won't
[52:55] hide a bad cake
[52:56] Oh it'll look pretty my brother and
[53:00] sister but the first bite will tell
[53:01] whether it's real or not
[53:03] hallelujah mine's me of a wedding went
[53:10] to I won't say who but we went to a
[53:13] wedding one timing and the wedding was
[53:17] all over in there packing stuff up

[53:23] of cake leftover it was all I could do

[53:44] spot but I tell you what butter you know
[53:51] how to make a cake or a pie unless you
[53:53] know how to use butter hallelujah and
[53:56] you make something with love that's the
[53:59] butter amen that's the butter hallelujah
[54:04] we don't want no cardboard religion hey

[54:09] quotes we don't want some kind of
[54:11] cardboard atmosphere in the church amen
[54:13] I want to come in house of God and I
[54:15] want God to bless us that we come in
[54:17] here and we just look like a bunch of
[54:19] selfish little children just chowing
[54:21] down hey man can I have another piece
[54:23] you've already had three that's all
[54:25] right there's a lot of cake

[54:31] of here at this rate
[54:33] Alleluia so look my brother and sister
[54:36] we're not looking for a watered down
[54:38] calling amen
[54:41] that song says he wasn't looking at me
[54:43] Oh hallelujah think about it he wasn't
[54:47] looking at me he looked at his word and
[54:49] he is his word so he actually you might
[54:52] say looked at himself and said no matter
[54:54] what
[54:54] or where they been where they come from
[54:57] or whether the devil's trying to take
[54:58] him I am more than sufficient to redeem
[55:01] them hallelujah and so I'm just gonna
[55:04] call him redeemed amen
[55:07] even before the price was paid right
[55:08] before the foundation of the world
[55:10] before the price was paid he said I'm
[55:12] gonna call them redeemed Oh hallelujah I
[55:17] know it's terrible but song comes to my
[55:21] mind from my childhood and I won't
[55:24] repeat it because I don't want to get in
[55:25] trouble but my brother and sister
[55:28] there's a time you know when you look at
[55:31] it from before the foundation in the
[55:32] world some of you might figure this out
[55:34] I'm just not going to voice it Amen when
[55:36] you look at this from the foundation of
[55:38] the world and the devil come afterwards
[55:42] and said this is who you are let's look
[55:46] back to what God said we were there

[58:15] and when they did these fellows were so
[58:17] veiled they just laughed it they didn't
[58:21] know what it was all about see they're
[58:24] still veil so there is some inside and
[58:28] some outside and so but God is in full
[58:30] view of us here look at this
[58:37] talk about a paradox God's in field full

[58:54] behind the dish Chicana glue I got a
[58:57] crumb and that crumb was so good I had

[59:12] speaking to a believer he's not speaking
[59:14] to some church guy he's not speaking to
[59:16] somebody that just has a ritual and a
[59:18] tradition he's talking to a real
[59:20] believer full view of us
[59:22] kid same now then when God in His mercy
[59:25] rent the veil he was brought into plain

[1:02:41] let's be deeper than we thought
[1:02:47] yeah you know I was sharing with a guy
[1:02:50] today I don't know how we got on the
[1:02:52] subject but a grease salesman come by
[1:02:55] the farm today and we were talking and
[1:02:58] somehow we got talking about boats and
[1:03:02] water and something got mentioned about
[1:03:05] Hills Canyon there were other people in
[1:03:07] the conversation and I said well my wife
[1:03:08] and I been to Hells Canyon twice up and
[1:03:11] down hills Canyon twice once we went the
[1:03:13] water was so high that the guy says my
[1:03:16] we got to be careful because there's
[1:03:17] rocks here that that normally you can
[1:03:19] see now we can't see him because the
[1:03:21] water so high and we went down the river
[1:03:23] and on the way back up the river slammed
[1:03:25] that boat into a big ol rock and a
[1:03:27] Rapids you know and and had the the over
[1:03:31] efforts on the boat just screaming and
[1:03:33] some guy says sir there's something
[1:03:35] wrong and he said I've got it all under
[1:03:37] control
[1:03:37] and now over rev limiters are just going
[1:03:41] and we just barely climbed up that
[1:03:44] Rapids and got out on top
[1:03:48] and we've also went back to went down
[1:03:51] that same chunk of river and one of the
[1:03:53] lowest points they said had been in 25
[1:03:55] or 30 years and you know them rocks we
[1:03:58] were dodging that were still under the
[1:03:59] water we're now 20 feet above us high
[1:04:05] and dry my brother and sister it's all
[1:04:10] there the glory of God is all there
[1:04:15] sometimes it's hid but did you know the
[1:04:20] human nature will cause us when the
[1:04:22] blessings of God are pouring overflowing
[1:04:24] we'll gripe and when it doesn't seem
[1:04:28] like there's any blessings of God we'll
[1:04:30] gripe did you know they've recently
[1:04:35] figured out that they're certain
[1:04:38] euphoric like enzymes released in
[1:04:41] humanity for certain things and when
[1:04:46] something is done did you know you can
[1:04:48] actually and I hope you catch the humor
[1:04:52] of this I I was like that's the truth

[1:04:57] will come to pass like you can put
[1:05:00] certain food down in front of somebody
[1:05:02] and they mentioned ice cream and the
[1:05:06] person not even touch it just see it and
[1:05:09] start salivating what is that it
[1:05:17] actually is some kind of little
[1:05:18] something that's released in you and
[1:05:20] your body responds and they said it can
[1:05:23] be so great that a person can just think
[1:05:26] of thought about something and a
[1:05:30] stimulation will come into their body
[1:05:31] over that font

[1:17:43] to be partakers of all that he is were
[1:17:46] invited into him which is hid to
[1:17:48] unbelievers by the veil of human flesh
[1:17:51] they know that glory they read of it
[1:17:56] it's in the word here the glory of God
[1:17:59] and things like that it's just word to
[1:18:02] them but this is not word as in the word
[1:18:05] this is just we read it huh well if we
[1:18:11] knew the Arabic and understood what this
[1:18:17] word meant in the Hebrew come on I've
[1:18:21] had message believers tell me that well
[1:18:23] brother Paul we'd can't fully grasp that
[1:18:25] unless we was to go study Hebrew and the
[1:18:27] brother told me he says I've ordered a
[1:18:29] home study course on Hebrew I patted him
[1:18:31] on the back said god bless you brother
[1:18:33] study the Hebrew I think he probably
[1:18:36] thought I gave him permission but what
[1:18:38] he didn't realize is I started just
[1:18:39] distancing myself just in case that
[1:18:42] would rub off on me cuz one can you see
[1:18:45] brother Paul can't even get English
[1:18:47] right
[1:18:47] imagine him trying to do Hebrew
[1:18:49] I might as well just go out and become a
[1:18:51] drunk because I'd never make it through
[1:18:54] the Hebrew to understand God but you see
[1:18:58] that wasn't what my prophet told me he
[1:19:00] told me to pray for Revelation pray for
[1:19:03] it more than anything else and so I pray
[1:19:06] for Revelation I sent a loader I said in
[1:19:08] a tractor I sat in the truck
[1:19:09] lord please show yourself to me open
[1:19:11] your word to me Lord break live to me
[1:19:14] Lord I might not be the smartest knife
[1:19:16] or sharpest knife in the drawer but Lord
[1:19:18] I am a son of God
[1:19:20] I am called I've been redeemed
[1:19:24] hallelujah they read it the glory of God
[1:19:28] things like that it's just word to them
[1:19:30] to us it's a manifestation Oh
[1:19:34] my Bible tells me that I was in him
[1:19:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:38] hallelujah poured I've known you all my
[1:19:40] life Oh hallelujah see it's no more a
[1:19:46] word it's a reality God said let there
[1:19:49] be light that was the word oh I hope
[1:19:52] there's some stumble you I had to read
[1:19:53] this a lot of times before it's started
[1:19:55] to recognize what was being said let
[1:19:57] there be light that was the word but now
[1:20:00] there is light it ain't the word did you
[1:20:07] catch that my brother and sister people
[1:20:10] are like we're waiting for prophecy to
[1:20:12] come to pass for the bride to be lifted
[1:20:15] up because a prophet of God said that
[1:20:16] we'd move beyond this it's not like a
[1:20:18] whole nother church age but we're moving
[1:20:19] beyond this into the bride age and we're
[1:20:22] waiting for that to be manifested and
[1:20:24] I'm there but what are you talking about
[1:20:26] I'm already living in it
[1:20:28] amen I've already been blessed I'm in
[1:20:31] the bride age the word has been opened
[1:20:34] amen the third pole is not a cliche amen
[1:20:38] the opening of the seals is not a cliche
[1:20:41] Amen I get a live it it's a
[1:20:44] manifestation hallelujah so it's no
[1:20:48] longer let there be light the light has
[1:20:50] come Oh hallelujah the light is here it
[1:20:55] ain't a word is so light see what I mean
[1:20:58] now it isn't just a written word to us
[1:21:02] it's
[1:21:03] reality see we can sit back and say oh
[1:21:06] praise the Lord the Prophet said this
[1:21:08] the Prophet said that I was reading my
[1:21:09] Bible my brother and sisters someone on
[1:21:12] the face of the earth is a manifestation
[1:21:14] of a prophets message someone is living
[1:21:19] that life it's coming out of them it's
[1:21:23] being drawn right out of them Oh
[1:21:26] hallelujah somebody doesn't gotta go out
[1:21:29] sorry sister Nadia but we don't got to
[1:21:31] go over here now sister Nadia you need
[1:21:33] to be a good believer come on what is it
[1:21:39] it's being drawn out of us
[1:21:44] amen that life is coming out of my very
[1:21:48] pores hallelujah oh now it isn't just
[1:21:56] written word to us it's a reality we are
[1:21:59] in him now I know some folks around the
[1:22:03] message that would criticize me and say
[1:22:05] brother Paul you believe parousia well I
[1:22:08] don't know what your deal is but the
[1:22:10] problem with those kind of things is is
[1:22:11] people won't tell you their opinion but
[1:22:14] they want to hear their opinion come out
[1:22:16] of your mouth well I'm sorry
[1:22:19] Purusha is not all negative
[1:22:23] somebody perverted it tried to turn it
[1:22:27] twist it trying to turn it into a
[1:22:29] shortcut pilgrims progress kids how did
[1:22:34] that shortcut work it didn't now it
[1:22:44] isn't just a written word to us it's a
[1:22:46] reality we are in him napple we're old
[1:22:50] sour cranky you left out a comma in a
[1:22:55] period no sir I'm sorry I'm too busy

[1:27:29] they give you all this stuff and at the
[1:27:31] end of the Vacation Bible School all you
[1:27:33] had to do is be able to recite I think
[1:27:35] it was like seven I had some reason it
[1:27:37] was seven but I'd be able to recite
[1:27:39] seven pieces of Scripture and I remember
[1:27:43] the Vacation Bible School teacher
[1:27:46] chastising me in front of the other kids
[1:27:49] because I messed up my verses if you had
[1:27:54] tried Paul let she know that I've set
[1:27:57] night after night and read them and read
[1:27:59] them and read them I just couldn't
[1:28:03] remember she was like no that's not the
[1:28:07] second verse that's the fifth one
[1:28:10] I don't know maybe my mind just took me
[1:28:12] to the ones that were important to me I
[1:28:13] don't know but I don't need to be able
[1:28:18] to quote the encyclopedia of the word I
[1:28:20] don't need to be able to tell you every
[1:28:22] message and what paragraph it was
[1:28:24] I just need Christ in me and I need to
[1:28:29] get in to him hallelujah amen he wrote
[1:28:33] the scripture he's more than able to
