[2:19] Why don't we sing that song? As the
[2:21] deer,
[2:22] as the deer penteth for
[2:29] the water, so my soul longeth after
[2:36] thee.

[18:45] any unspoken requests by uplifted hands,
[18:53] let's bow our heads. Our precious
[18:56] heavenly father, it is a great joy to
[19:00] bring our needs before you. You knowing
[19:02] what we would ask. And now, Lord, by
[19:06] your grace and mercy, we can come to
[19:08] you, Lord, having no condemnation to
[19:12] know that what we ask of you, you'll
[19:13] grant it to us. We're so thankful, Lord,
[19:16] that we have a father that knows
[19:19] everything we need and can meet that
[19:21] need. And you've heard these requests
[19:23] tonight. May you in your divine purpose
[19:28] and providence meet every one of these
[19:30] needs. Them that had the car trouble,
[19:33] Lord, and our sister April overseas,

[20:02] word.
[20:03] Lord, for you said, "We shall know the
[20:06] truth, and the truth shall make us
[20:07] free." And we're so happy, Lord, to know
[20:10] truth in this hour, to be able to walk
[20:12] in the light of the hour, knowing it's
[20:14] leading us into a body change. We thank
[20:17] you for this in Jesus Christ's name and
[20:20] we give you praise believing that we
[20:22] have what we ask for. Amen.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Seated.
[20:31] We'll just sing one more.
[20:39] There we go. We'll just sing one more
[20:41] song before we hand it over to brother
[20:42] Paul. Um, I sing I surrender all song.
[20:47] Just couldn't stop thinking about it. I
[20:48] was getting ready for service tonight.
[20:51] I think we sang it on Sunday, but it's a
[20:54] good song. Good confession.
[21:00] All to Jesus.

[21:09] All to him. my freely

[21:22] love
[21:23] and trust him in his presence
[21:30] daily
[21:32] live.
[21:34] I
[21:36] surrender
[21:38] all.
[21:42] I
[21:44] surrender
[21:46] all.
[21:50] All to thee, my blessed
[21:56] savior.
[21:58] I surrender
[22:02] all.
[22:06] All to Jesus

[22:24] pleasures
[22:25] all forsen.
[22:29] Take me Jesus.
[22:33] Take me now.

[22:48] all.

[23:53] All to thee, my blessed
[23:59] Savior.
[24:01] I

[25:40] I

[25:47] I
[25:49] surrender
[25:51] all
[25:56] to thee my blessed
[26:01] savior
[26:03] I
[26:04] surren
[26:07] [Music]
[26:10] to be in the house of the Lord tonight.
[26:13] Amen.
[26:15] I just want to uh give my personal
[26:18] greeting to brother Eric, sister Kylie.
[26:22] I I was kind of rehearsing this in my
[26:25] mind and I thought, you know, it's
[26:27] wonderful to see old friends, but I'm
[26:29] not sure that would come out quite
[26:30] right.
[26:32] So, it's wonderful to see friends that
[26:35] we've had for a long, long time. Amen.
[26:39] And u we sure appreciate them. Brother
[26:42] Eric, Sister Kylie, Sister Kylie is
[26:45] actually from Australia
[26:48] originally and she donated, I think I
[26:51] heard her say it this way once, she gave
[26:53] this portion of her life to be a
[26:55] Canadian and now she wanted to recapture
[26:59] uh her life as u being an Aussie. And so
[27:03] there you're living in Melbourne, right?
[27:05] Yes. And uh anyway, just wonderful to
[27:08] have you here with us and each and every
[27:11] one of you tonight. Amen. God bless you.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; And uh we just uh want the Lord to just
[27:17] speak to our hearts tonight. Um, we had
[27:20] a wonderful time
[27:23] uh in uh Salt Lake City to see our dear
[27:27] niece Beth uh graduate with honors as an
[27:31] RN and uh just a nice time to be
[27:35] together with family and uh I just
[27:39] really, you know, appreciated
[27:42] uh the effort that she, you know, had
[27:45] and she put forth her testimony that she
[27:49] maintained through school and the people
[27:51] that went to to school with her uh she
[27:54] interacted with, they just um a handful
[27:57] of them uh from different areas, but you
[28:00] know, you could see those that knew her
[28:02] just really really love and respected
[28:04] her and that was just encouraging that
[28:06] uh to see that that we can live our
[28:09] testimony. It might have affected my
[28:12] thought tonight. Uh God bless you. Uh we
[28:15] appreciate you and um wonderful
[28:18] beautiful song service. Um
[28:22] but I want to just speak to you for a
[28:24] few minutes tonight uh of revelation on
[28:27] display. Amen. And uh you know it seems
[28:31] like you know that's kind of like saying
[28:33] faith on display and is faith a tangible
[28:36] thing as though you could lay your hand
[28:37] on it or hold up something and say this
[28:40] is faith. And uh we just want to look at
[28:42] this in a positive light tonight uh of
[28:45] what God does and how he brings it
[28:48] about. And uh so let's just stand as
[28:50] we'll just go into the scripture tonight
[28:53] uh and uh turn in our Bibles to Matthew
[28:57] the 5th chapter verse 14-19.
[29:02] And uh I just love how the word gives
[29:04] such encouragement to us. Uh how that uh
[29:08] God ultimately while the word of God is
[29:11] a word of correction, we can look at
[29:14] this and realize ultimately what God is
[29:16] really desiring to do is to bring you
[29:20] and I to a place that we are just so
[29:23] certain of who we are.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; That we just absolutely know. And it
[29:27] doesn't matter if the sun is shining or
[29:29] cloudy skies, whether there's trouble in
[29:32] the land, trouble in our lives, we can
[29:34] get up in the morning and say, "I know
[29:36] that I know that I'm a son or a daughter
[29:38] of God." And nothing Satan can do will
[29:42] separate us from the love of God. And
[29:44] that's that's one of the things that we
[29:46] have to catch. You know, we don't want
[29:48] to be just sunny day Christians. you
[29:50] know, when all is well, we can praise
[29:53] the Lord, but we want to get up in the
[29:55] in the hard times. And now, we don't
[29:58] want to, you know, cast a negative
[30:00] light, so we won't ask you to raise a
[30:02] hand, but you're human. I'm human. We
[30:05] have hard times.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; We face challenges that set us back,
[30:10] discourage us, and sometimes we look at
[30:13] that and say, Lord, what is happening?
[30:16] But the truth of it is without those
[30:19] things molding our character, we would
[30:22] be as spoiled children. We would just
[30:25] expect God just to always be pouring
[30:27] blessings out on us and he wants to. But
[30:31] we have to have our character molded,
[30:34] right? The scripture, the prophets
[30:36] showed us clearly how that to have the
[30:40] authority and power of the word poured
[30:42] into us without character would bring a
[30:46] satanic result. And and we see that we
[30:49] see that in the world today, politics
[30:52] all over the world or these people who
[30:54] have great authority but no character.
[30:56] And then it just leads to trouble.
[30:58] Matthew 5:es 14-19.
[31:02] Ye are the light of the world. Can
[31:04] someone say amen?
[31:06] &gt;&gt; A city that is set on a hill cannot be
[31:09] hid. Neither do men light a candle and
[31:12] put it under a bushel, but on a
[31:14] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[31:17] all that are in the house. Let your
[31:19] light so shine before men, that they may
[31:22] see your good works, and glorify your
[31:25] father which is in heaven. Now, I just
[31:28] want to interject this because we won't
[31:30] touch on this again, but so often we
[31:33] almost act as though we're embarrassed
[31:36] of our good works. We We'll say, "Well,
[31:39] I don't mean to sound too spiritual. I
[31:41] don't mean to." No, my brother and
[31:43] sister, if God is in you doing a mighty
[31:45] work, Amen. We should be standing up and
[31:47] saying, "Thank you, Lord, for the mighty
[31:49] work that is happening in my life." We
[31:52] shouldn't be ashamed. We shouldn't be
[31:54] backing up and saying, "Well, I don't
[31:55] want to sound like I'm boastful or
[31:57] nothing." My brother and sister, if
[31:59] you're boasting in your flesh, that will
[32:01] be revealed. But if you are giving glory
[32:03] to God, that will be revealed. Amen. And
[32:06] we are sons and daughters of God. We're
[32:08] not here of our own. We're not boasting
[32:10] of our flesh. So, we can just lift a
[32:12] hand and say, "God's doing a mighty work
[32:14] in me." Amen. God is changing me. He's
[32:17] leading me, guiding me. Do I stumble?
[32:20] Yes. But he catches me when I fall.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; That they may see your good works and
[32:27] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[32:31] Think not that I am come to destroy the
[32:33] law or the prophets. I am not come to
[32:36] destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say
[32:39] unto you, till heaven and earth pass,
[32:41] one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass
[32:44] from the law, till all be fulfilled.
[32:48] Whosoever therefore shall break one of
[32:50] these least commandments, and shall
[32:52] teach men so.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Oh boy, that's that's a hard line right
[32:57] there. We break it and we teach people
[32:59] to break it
[33:01] shall be called the least in the kingdom
[33:03] of heaven. But whosoever shall do and
[33:06] teach them, the same shall be called
[33:08] great in the kingdom of heaven. You
[33:11] know, here again, I bl brought that
[33:13] maybe so I could just make this
[33:15] statement. I want to be recognized as
[33:18] someone great in the kingdom of heaven.
[33:21] Amen. I'm not ashamed tonight to bring
[33:24] that up and say I I'm looking for God to
[33:27] lead me, guide me, pour himself into me,
[33:30] that when he looks down, he says, "This
[33:33] is a great man in my kingdom." Amen. As
[33:36] we'll look down through the church ages
[33:37] and we'll see through Revelations 2 and
[33:40] three, it is that we could see the
[33:42] scripture telling us that there will be
[33:45] those that will be a pillar in the house
[33:47] of God. Any pillars here tonight?
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe there is. Heavenly
[33:52] Father, we just ask you to bless this
[33:54] time together in the precious name of
[33:56] Jesus. We ask for your Holy Spirit to
[33:58] move in our midst tonight. Lord, speak
[34:00] to our hearts for you know what we need,
[34:02] Father. so much more than man. Lord, let
[34:06] you just speak to our hearts each one in
[34:09] the fashion what we need to hear the
[34:12] encouragement, the strength, the
[34:13] correction in the name of Jesus Christ.
[34:16] Amen. You may be seated.
[34:19] Now, as we look at this tonight, we
[34:21] would see that the term revelation
[34:25] can be used pretty loosely, very broad.
[34:29] Amen. People will come uh uh around the
[34:32] message. I'm sure every uh religious
[34:34] movement had this, but we certainly see
[34:36] this around a message a lot. And people
[34:39] will come and say, "Well, the Lord has
[34:42] spoke to me and given me this
[34:43] revelation." Now, you know, I used to
[34:46] just kind of have almost a knee-jerk
[34:48] reaction and back up from that. But, you
[34:51] know, as time goes on, some of those
[34:52] revelations are just so far out they
[34:55] scare you. But some of those are
[34:58] personal.
[35:00] It's not for you and I to judge what God
[35:03] spoke to someone's heart. And when they
[35:05] might express that I just God gave me a
[35:08] revelation. What they're doing is saying
[35:10] that God come and revealed himself
[35:12] through his word through the prophet
[35:14] through whatever the reading of
[35:16] scripture through music through prayer.
[35:18] He revealed something to me. And and so
[35:21] we shouldn't be nervous when somebody
[35:23] starts to talk about revelation that has
[35:25] come to them. That revelation might be
[35:27] something that was revealed to you many
[35:30] years ago. Amen. So it's not as though
[35:33] like they must be immature even though
[35:35] they've been around the message. My
[35:37] brother and sister, every season brings
[35:40] forth a revelation and every revelation
[35:43] brings forth growth. Amen. So it's there
[35:46] that you will find that uh the term
[35:48] revelation can be used pretty loosely
[35:51] very broadly. Now my brother and sister
[35:55] the word revelation depending on which
[35:58] dictionary we've got so many of them in
[36:01] this day and age but it could be a
[36:03] divine supernatural disclosure. It could
[36:07] be an unknown fact revealed. It could be
[36:10] something that is divulged. And it also
[36:14] could be opinion. So we'll see how that
[36:17] it covers a very broad range to to see
[36:21] this. But as we are here tonight, we can
[36:24] look through the message and and we can
[36:26] see what God has uh been speaking to the
[36:28] bride of Christ through the ages,
[36:30] through the years, and we realize that
[36:32] each and every one of us, if we would
[36:34] stop and look back, take a an overview
[36:38] of our lives through the years, we would
[36:40] realize that we have had hundreds if not
[36:44] thousands of revelations ourself. Amen.
[36:47] Now, we're not trying to place that in a
[36:49] prophetic sense like Revelation coming
[36:52] to the prophet, but you'll find that as
[36:54] you have read your Bible and you've
[36:56] studied and you've prayed through the
[36:57] years, there are so many things that God
[37:00] has revealed to you and I that we often
[37:03] times just kind of say, "Wow, I I saw
[37:06] something I never saw before." Is this
[37:08] true? Amen. And so, you see that and
[37:11] realize that that really is a
[37:13] revelation. everything you see out of
[37:15] the word of God. Uh to the bride of
[37:18] Christ, not to the theologian, not to
[37:19] the intellectual, not to the borderline
[37:22] believer, but to the real bride of
[37:24] Christ. Everything that comes that opens
[37:26] our eyes and deepens our understanding
[37:28] is a revelation that comes from God. It
[37:31] should not be an intellectual
[37:33] revelation. It should be an intimate
[37:35] personal from God coming down to you and
[37:38] I. And it will be that kind of
[37:40] revelation that will actually uh mature
[37:43] the bride. Amen. Not that we went and
[37:45] studied. Some people say, "Well, you
[37:47] know, study the Greek and the Hebrew and
[37:49] those that are really good at uh uh uh
[37:52] um uh you know, languages, you know,
[37:55] that's that's well and good, but some of
[37:57] us aren't so good with languages. And it
[37:59] wouldn't do me good to spend my rest of
[38:01] my life trying to learn, you know, Greek
[38:03] and Hebrew and Aramaic. I I would just
[38:06] burn a lot of my life up and and not
[38:08] really have an answer to it. But my
[38:11] brother and sister, God promised to give
[38:13] supernatural disclosure to the bride of
[38:16] Jesus Christ. He said that the mysteries
[38:19] would be revealed. Amen. And we're
[38:22] living in the hour that he said the
[38:24] mysteries would be revealed. So don't be
[38:26] shocked when God wants to pour that into
[38:29] you. Don't get nervous that maybe I'm
[38:31] getting out of my position. You are here
[38:34] according to the word of God to receive
[38:37] the mystery of Jesus Christ. And I could
[38:41] just sum that up so simple tonight. What
[38:43] is the mystery of Jesus Christ tonight,
[38:46] my brother and sister? The mystery of
[38:48] Jesus Christ is actually contained in
[38:51] his bride. That's what the word come
[38:53] for. God didn't need to reveal himself
[38:56] to himself, but he was revealing his
[38:59] word that a bride would recognize she
[39:02] has a bridegroom.
[39:04] Amen. Now, let's think about the human
[39:06] element and everyone who's ever, you
[39:08] know, had a courtship and got married
[39:10] and, you know, it's I always like to
[39:12] hear those. I always like to hear the
[39:14] story. You know, what is it? Why did you
[39:17] marry that person? And and sometimes you
[39:20] take young people, they've known each
[39:21] other for years, maybe growing up
[39:23] together, and and you would think, "Oh,
[39:26] yeah, this is just my friend, you know,
[39:28] girl, friend, and it's there." But one
[39:31] day, there's a little something happens.
[39:33] I I just recount this to you. Uh there
[39:36] was a a young man that I actually knew
[39:39] before he got this far into his
[39:41] engagement and onto his marriage. And he
[39:43] asked me, he says, "Brother Paul," he
[39:45] says, "I I I love this girl." He said,
[39:48] "I I don't just like her. I I I love
[39:50] this girl, but but you know, I don't
[39:52] know how to catch her attention." And I
[39:55] said, "Well, I mean, what is it? Is
[39:57] there competition?" And he was pretty
[39:59] funny. He goes, "Yeah, my own cousin."
[40:01] And we're both pursuing the same girl.
[40:04] And I said, "Well, what are you doing to
[40:06] win her?" He said, "I don't know what to
[40:08] do to win her." And I said, "Well, let
[40:11] me just give you a little clue. Once you
[40:13] start it though, you need to try to
[40:15] maintain this." And I just laid some
[40:17] things out to him that were just
[40:19] natural. And and uh you know, we went
[40:22] back a year later, this actually in the
[40:24] country of Chile. And we went back a
[40:26] year later and he was engaged. And and
[40:29] he'd come up to me and he says, "Brother
[40:30] Paul, it works." Now, what was that
[40:33] great mystery? I said, "You've got to
[40:36] give her attention that she recognizes
[40:39] no one else is going to give her."
[40:45] And when I give that to him, I said, 'J
[40:46] just simple examples. I don't have the
[40:48] answers.
[40:50] But if you're at a fellowship and her
[40:53] glass is empty and you're going to
[40:54] refill yours, you could just say, "Hey,
[40:57] can I fill your glass for you?" "Oh,
[41:00] here, let me catch the door for you."
[41:02] "Oh, what?" You know, and do those
[41:05] little things because you're showing you
[41:08] care. Now, poor analogy. Maybe forgive
[41:11] me tonight. Can we lift a hand tonight
[41:14] and say, "God has showed us He cares."
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Everywhere we go, everything we do in
[41:20] our lives, God is constantly showing you
[41:22] and I I care about you. I'm willing to
[41:26] come and be your comforter, your
[41:28] provider. I'm willing to be everything
[41:30] to you. I will bring you peace. I will
[41:33] bring all of this to you because I care.
[41:37] And so as God is moving through this, my
[41:39] brother and sisters, some people, they
[41:41] have spent their lives in church and
[41:43] they still have a relationship that God
[41:45] somewhere out here in the ether. He's
[41:47] just a God who doesn't really care so
[41:49] much. But I tell you, we serve a God
[41:51] tonight that is showing us constantly,
[41:54] I'm going to show you more of myself so
[41:57] you will have more confidence of who you
[41:59] are. Amen. And the more we see of Jesus
[42:02] Christ, the more confidence we have in
[42:04] who we are today. Amen. So it's there
[42:07] there's many revelations that are
[42:10] contained or concerning scripture
[42:12] opening up of that many things you know
[42:15] uh as a child I just remember my parents
[42:19] uh going through the various churches
[42:20] that they went through and you know they
[42:23] had questions and and uh you know they
[42:26] come to the message they come and and
[42:28] God started answering their questions
[42:30] they put fleeces before the Lord and and
[42:33] uh there were things in scripture they
[42:35] did not see the Book of Revelation seem
[42:37] to be so far off that don't even bother
[42:40] going there. We just can't understand
[42:42] it. But God said, "I want you to
[42:44] understand it because the book of
[42:45] Revelation is me."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you me.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure there's people that
[42:53] married complete strangers and it worked
[42:55] out just fine, but there is a little bit
[42:58] of a need really to know who you're
[43:00] marrying. Amen. And God said, "I'm going
[43:02] to come down and not only am I going to
[43:04] show you who I am, I'm going to bring
[43:06] you to such a place that you are going
[43:08] to desire beyond desire to be mine.
[43:12] You're going to want to be mine. You're
[43:14] going to do everything you can to be
[43:16] mine because I'm going to reveal to you
[43:18] a side that I'm not revealing to the
[43:20] whole world." Amen. The whole world, my
[43:22] brother and sister, there's people maybe
[43:24] some of them might even be listening
[43:26] tonight. They certainly been criticizing
[43:27] a lot lately. But my brother and sister,
[43:30] it's not a public display. It's not. So
[43:34] God can come and speak to you and I and
[43:36] reveal himself to you and I. Amen. And
[43:39] they'll miss it by a mile. Amen. All
[43:42] they can see is a negative. All they can
[43:44] see is a mistake. All they can see is
[43:46] something they don't understand. But
[43:48] it's not to them. God is speaking to you
[43:51] because God deals in personal
[43:53] revelation. Amen. And now the prophet of
[43:56] God preached many many thoughts and
[43:58] brought many scriptures out and many
[44:00] people in the congregation would have
[44:02] went away saying praise God I see this
[44:05] the word has been open to me I see this
[44:07] many would be there but my brother and
[44:09] sister he didn't come and say now I'm
[44:11] going to give you a blanket explanation
[44:14] he come and he preached the word and he
[44:16] expected the Holy Spirit to come and
[44:20] interpret the word to us
[44:24] Without that, all we heard was words.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Because there's no two humans alike, a
[44:32] husband and a wife. You know, they get
[44:34] to be so much alike that they finish
[44:36] each other's sentences and and uh you
[44:38] know, it's like, what would you like?
[44:40] And you already know what they would
[44:41] like because that's who they are and you
[44:43] know them. But God said, you know what?
[44:46] I'm going to come down. I'll deal with
[44:47] this on the individual level so that you
[44:50] will know it's me.
[44:53] It won't be just familiarity
[44:56] but it will be me that is there. And so
[44:59] we'll find that when we start talking
[45:01] about revelation
[45:03] um true revelation opens the word to the
[45:06] individual to the bride and it's always
[45:09] according to the word.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now my brother and sister God
[45:13] didn't come and say according to the
[45:16] latest interpretation of the word. It's
[45:19] always been God's interpretation. Amen.
[45:22] God's word doesn't need an interpreter.
[45:25] God is doing just fine interpreting his
[45:28] word. And he interprets it as brother
[45:31] Brandham shows us by bringing it to
[45:33] pass. Now, I want to ask you this
[45:34] question. I know we'll have a positive
[45:36] response. Has God been interpreting
[45:38] anything to you? Amen. There it is. We
[45:41] got our own private interpretator. We
[45:43] don't need to go out here and try and
[45:45] find some man with an education to
[45:47] interpret the word to us. But it's God
[45:50] himself coming down and it will be so
[45:52] personal it even discerns to the
[45:55] thoughts and intents of your heart. How
[45:58] many times have we sat in the house of
[46:01] God and the word of God preached has
[46:03] come and dealt with a subject that was
[46:06] there something you haven't spoke to to
[46:08] a husband or a wife or a friend or
[46:11] anyone especially not the preacher.
[46:14] Amen. We haven't spoken a single word
[46:16] and yet it comes and it touches right
[46:19] down to the midst of our need and God
[46:22] would speak to us and we say there's my
[46:24] answer. Do you realize my brother and
[46:26] sister that's revelation?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get people saying, "Well, I
[46:30] just feel like a nobody. I feel like
[46:32] that I'm just a nothing. I'm hearing the
[46:34] message and it just feels like I'm not
[46:36] overly spiritual. I I'm not overly uh
[46:39] you might say intellectual to understand
[46:41] and put all this together." intellectual
[46:43] in a good way. I don't seem to be able
[46:46] to put all this together and I sometimes
[46:48] question, do I really understand what I
[46:50] think I understand or is my
[46:52] understanding misunderstanding?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And God comes and he speaks to us
[46:58] and we just the light turns on and we
[47:00] go, "Oh, that was good." We walk away.
[47:02] We don't think a whole lot about it.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; But if we was to write it all down and
[47:09] look back in our life, we'd realize
[47:12] When the word said that he would come in
[47:15] our midst and reveal himself,
[47:18] he's fulfilled that.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; We don't need to look for a great
[47:21] movement of some great mysteries taking
[47:23] place and some supernatural. Amen. Where
[47:26] the Holy Ghost is present, the
[47:27] supernatural is present.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, people are going off looking
[47:32] for the supernatural. They want
[47:34] something supernatural they can hang
[47:36] their hat on and say, "Look what God
[47:38] did." But my brother and sister, just
[47:40] the simple fact that we're in the house
[47:42] of God, and he said, "I'll meet you in
[47:44] there." Amen. Going back to the vision,
[47:46] the little room, and the uh God speaking
[47:48] and says, "I'll meet you in there." And
[47:50] he has come down to his bride and has
[47:54] continually met his bride in there.
[47:56] Amen. In the word is where he's met her.
[47:59] It isn't a little building. For all
[48:01] those years, everybody thought there was
[48:03] going to be a little building on a stage
[48:05] and people were going to go walking
[48:07] through that. But what God was talking
[48:09] about in that vision to the prophet is
[48:12] the people coming into a place where
[48:14] they're in the presence of God.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not church, not a tent, not an
[48:20] auditorium, the presence of God. And God
[48:23] spoke to the prophet, but he was really
[48:25] speaking to you and I. And he says,
[48:26] "When you get in my presence, I'll meet
[48:29] you in there." And that's where
[48:32] revelation comes. It's not a a love
[48:34] letter. That's good. Letters are great.
[48:37] But if you spent, you know, 50 years
[48:39] later, you're still writing letters to
[48:42] that girl. You have missed the essence
[48:44] of what it was all about. Amen. There
[48:47] has to come a time that the relationship
[48:50] is taking place and being fulfilled.
[48:53] Amen. And so, it's there that we'll look
[48:56] at this uh and we'll see. I I just love
[48:58] the expression of Matthew 5 here because
[49:01] it's telling us that um we are not going
[49:05] to uh light uh a candle and put it on a
[49:10] b bushel. Amen. We're we're not going to
[49:12] come to a place that we're just like,
[49:15] you know, I'm going to I'm going to be
[49:17] like a secret Christian.
[49:20] I don't want to be ridiculed at work. I
[49:22] don't want my family I don't want
[49:23] anybody to, you know, look down on me.
[49:25] I'll just be a secret Christian. Your
[49:27] light's not lit.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Because when you get a real infilling of
[49:33] the Holy Ghost, you're going to be
[49:35] fulfilling this scripture and you're
[49:37] going to put your light, your candle on
[49:40] the hilltop. Amen. On the top where it
[49:44] can't be hid. That's just a natural
[49:47] reaction that comes when we have
[49:50] received the word, the light. Amen. So,
[49:53] I I love how that comes. It it's uh just
[49:56] beautiful. The word in you can't be hid.
[49:59] Let's face it. I was speaking to a young
[50:01] man recently and he said, "Well, I just
[50:03] really don't want to be criticized by my
[50:05] family. Uh so I I'm just going to kind
[50:08] of I'm going to just kind of hold this
[50:10] back a little bit." And I told him,
[50:11] "Please don't do that." Amen. If God's
[50:14] dealing with you, put it right out in
[50:15] the public. Let the world know right now
[50:18] who you are. Amen. Because they're going
[50:20] to see that the old you is not the new
[50:23] you. And the new you is the real you. So
[50:26] don't go and try and just taper this off
[50:28] that years go by and they finally
[50:31] realize he he's changed a little.
[50:35] No, the light put it up. Let it be seen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you're doing is saying it's
[50:43] been revealed to me. I've got revelation
[50:45] of who I really am. The old me has
[50:48] passed away. I've got a revelation of
[50:50] who the new me is. And I want you to
[50:53] know the new me. I want you to know who
[50:55] I am really am. Amen. And so, you know,
[51:00] there really shouldn't even be a desire
[51:01] to put it under a bushel. No.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember I'll just share this
[51:06] personal. I keep it, you know, in this
[51:08] sense. I can remember years ago
[51:10] unfortunately uh you know I I guess I
[51:13] was a little bit ashamed maybe I don't
[51:16] know a little reserved
[51:18] you know and you'd be in a restaurant or
[51:21] you'd be uh at a place where a bunch of
[51:23] farmers used to gather and I used to go
[51:25] there pretty regular and um you know you
[51:29] just don't want to deal with the flack
[51:31] don't want to deal with the snide
[51:32] comments you don't want to deal with so
[51:35] it'd be almost like
[51:38] Lordless us his food.
[51:43] Any of you ever been there?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:47] But you know, the Lord dealt with me one
[51:49] day.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Just like he's dealt with you and one
[51:54] day I was like, "Lord, I will not be
[51:56] ashamed of you. I don't even want it to
[51:58] look like I possibly would be ashamed."
[52:00] I started bowing my head and praying.
[52:03] And you know, the end result of that was
[52:05] is those guys would stop eating and bow
[52:07] their heads with me.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what God was waiting for was
[52:12] for me to have the courage to just let
[52:15] it be shining forth. And it turns out
[52:18] these people, they don't go to church.
[52:20] They hardly believe in God except to use
[52:22] his name in vain. And and that's just
[52:24] not who they are. But there was
[52:25] something there that they said, "Whoa,
[52:28] he's praying. Bow your heads." They'd
[52:31] take their hats off. They would do that.
[52:33] And you know, the thing is is uh God's
[52:35] just waiting for you and I to actually
[52:37] put our light up where it can be seen.
[52:40] We got this idea, I'd rather put my
[52:42] light up amongst Christians so that they
[52:45] can really respect what it is. But maybe
[52:48] God wants you to put your light up in
[52:51] the darkest place in town,
[52:53] &gt;&gt; in the darkest corner of your world.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; He wants you to put the light up.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; And you don't know who's going to see by
[53:00] that light.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brham says here in
[53:03] Let Your Light So Shine before men.
[53:06] Amen. And uh let me just interject this
[53:09] right now. We're seeing God deal with
[53:12] our sister Lisa. And as she come up uh
[53:16] in the service, and you dealt with her,
[53:19] Brother David, we're seeing my brother
[53:22] and sister. I don't know the future, but
[53:24] we're seeing how God would lead an
[53:27] individual that was right here on this
[53:30] street one day. And God says, "Go into
[53:32] that church."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, it wasn't cuz our church is so
[53:36] special. I'm I'm happy what God's
[53:38] blessed us with. Don't misunderstand.
[53:40] But it's not like it's the prettiest
[53:42] church in town and it's just so majestic
[53:44] and we're advertising our choir and our
[53:46] our club meetings and our, you know,
[53:49] feasts and whatever. No, but God's
[53:51] dealing, my brother and sister, and God
[53:53] dealt with Lisa. And God's really
[53:55] dealing with Lisa. Now, you can't hear
[53:58] the words on the service really of what
[54:00] is said here, but I already heard them
[54:03] the Sunday before. She already poured
[54:06] her heart out to me sitting in the back
[54:07] right here. Pray for her. Hold her up
[54:10] before God. My, that lady has had such a
[54:14] rough life, so many things in her life
[54:17] that would discourage so many people.
[54:20] But I believe with all of my heart
[54:21] tonight, she's got a revelation. God is
[54:25] revealing himself to her and she is
[54:27] sitting there and she's talking about
[54:29] things like a sweet presence. Now, I'll
[54:33] tell you my brother and sister, this
[54:34] might sound a little hard, but I watch
[54:36] some of you walk out of church after
[54:37] services sometimes and there's not much
[54:40] sweet presence available.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Is that a little too harsh?
[54:45] &gt;&gt; I think it's truthful.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But here God is dealing with this
[54:51] sister and she's saying there's a sweet
[54:54] presence.
[54:56] Oh Lord, let me lift my light a little
[54:58] higher. Not that Paul can boast. Not
[55:01] that you can boast, but it can be seen.
[55:04] Amen. That it can be seen by those that
[55:07] were homeless and drug addicts and have
[55:09] all kinds of trouble in their life. Let
[55:11] it be seen by them. We don't need to
[55:14] convert a theologian. We need to convert
[55:16] a hungry soul. Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you look at this. There
[55:21] shouldn't even be a desire in us to put
[55:23] it under a bushel.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; I like this. Let your light so shine
[55:28] before men. 1961.
[55:32] You may never see a vision.
[55:37] You may never put your hands on a sick
[55:39] person and feel the charge of Almighty
[55:42] God make a skeleton of a man turn back
[55:45] to life again.
[55:47] You may never see him standing yondering
[55:50] three or four rainbows. You may never
[55:53] see his image. You may never hear his
[55:57] voice.
[55:59] But you can still But still you can be a
[56:02] signboard that will reflect Jesus Christ
[56:06] by a life that's been so pure and
[56:08] unadulterated from the world, not
[56:11] cluttered up with dirty things around
[56:12] your life, but a pure thing that'll
[56:15] cause the hungry heart to hunger and
[56:18] thirst to be like you.
[56:23] Now, see where Satan's battle is,
[56:25] saints.
[56:27] I'm just going to take a stab in the
[56:28] dark that many of us here tonight would
[56:31] say, "Oh my, I don't know why they would
[56:33] want to be like me." Because Satan's
[56:35] going to raise images up before you.
[56:37] Going to raise voices up before you.
[56:39] Going to bring remembrance of things up
[56:42] before you that would cause you to go,
[56:44] "Oh, man. No, I mean, not like me." But
[56:47] I want you to stop and look at it now
[56:49] over the banister of heaven from the way
[56:51] that God is looking at you and says,
[56:53] "This is my son. This is my daughter."
[56:56] And the light is in them. And even
[56:59] though they don't recognize it, it is
[57:01] shining out of them. And they want to be
[57:04] like you.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say, "Lord, let that be
[57:07] me."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we would stand. It's not how
[57:11] you feel. It's not what you view
[57:13] yourself. It's not your emotion or your
[57:16] reasoning, but it's a work that God is
[57:18] doing through you is what people are
[57:21] looking at. Oh, my brothers and sister,
[57:23] I've shared with you before in the
[57:25] harvest season how, you know, you lose
[57:27] your cool and go back and then apologize
[57:29] or repent to to the individual. I'm
[57:32] sorry that I that I got so frustrated or
[57:35] or maybe I should just be honest, so
[57:36] angry.
[57:38] And then they say, "No, quite honestly,
[57:40] I never even thought about it that way
[57:43] cuz I just realized my part of this
[57:45] equation." And I'm like, "Lord, forgive
[57:48] me." But you see, God, because he's so
[57:52] gracious, didn't let them see you the
[57:55] way you saw yourself.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful that God
[58:02] doesn't let the world see you like
[58:04] sometimes you see yourself. Amen.
[58:07] because they're seeing light that is
[58:09] different. It's a casting a light into
[58:12] their life that they don't have. And
[58:14] we're looking at it like it's a dark
[58:16] shadow that flickered across our life.
[58:18] But they only see light. And God says,
[58:21] "You know what? I'm going to use you to
[58:23] be the light in their life." But if
[58:26] we're here under a blanket condemnation,
[58:28] we'd be saying, "I could never testify
[58:31] to that person. I could never witness to
[58:33] that person cuz I've got my own issues.
[58:35] I've got my own struggles. I've got my
[58:38] own. What could I say to them? You could
[58:40] say what God asked you to say. Amen. You
[58:43] can let the life that God's put in you
[58:46] pour out.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Don't put a bushel over it. That's what
[58:49] Satan wants us to do is to put the
[58:51] bushel over our own life. Not Satan
[58:54] coming and putting the bushel over our
[58:56] life. We put the bushel
[58:59] &gt;&gt; over our life.
[59:02] See, God wants us to realize he's doing
[59:05] something that's so far beyond us that
[59:08] we don't even comprehend it.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; We're still looking at us.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; We need to be looking at him.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; He's the one.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light is his light.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The pedestal, you might say, the
[59:24] lifting up the light, my brother and
[59:26] sister, we're not lifting up the light.
[59:28] He's lifted the light he placed in us
[59:30] already. and made it obvious to the
[59:32] world today because it's all him.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; It's all him.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; But you can still be a signboard that
[59:41] will reflect Jesus Christ by life that's
[59:43] been so pure and unadulterated from the
[59:45] world. So there's our part, our action,
[59:48] not cluttered up with dirty things
[59:49] around your life, but a pure thing that
[59:51] caused a hungry heart to hunger and
[59:53] thirst to be like you. Amen. And you're
[59:57] the salt of the earth. As the salt has
[59:59] lost its savor wherewith it shall be
[1:00:01] salted. That's right. Hungering and
[1:00:03] thirsting. Let your light so shine
[1:00:05] before men that they may see your good
[1:00:07] works. See what you do and glorify the
[1:00:11] father what's in heaven hungering
[1:00:13] signboards reflecting wonderful. Yes
[1:00:17] sir. Amen. Now look at that my brother
[1:00:19] and sister. This is God working in you
[1:00:23] and I. This is beyond a human element.
[1:00:27] It it is not us saying, "You know what?
[1:00:29] I believe the message of the hour and
[1:00:32] I'm going to go be a signborn."
[1:00:34] No, sir. This is after you've went
[1:00:36] through the fiery trial, the
[1:00:38] discouragements, the troubles, the
[1:00:40] failures. Amen. You might be standing
[1:00:42] there. If I could figuratively say this,
[1:00:44] you got mud on your face and you're
[1:00:46] there and somebody's saying, "If that
[1:00:48] happened to me in the state that I'm in,
[1:00:50] I'd be destroyed." But look at them.
[1:00:51] They still are standing on the word of
[1:00:53] God, still believing the word. They're
[1:00:55] still pressing forward. I want to be
[1:00:57] like that.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want to crumble under the
[1:01:00] pressure of life. I want to have what
[1:01:03] they've got because I've saw what
[1:01:05] they've went through and they're still
[1:01:06] standing. They're still praising God. I
[1:01:09] want to be like that. And we're over
[1:01:10] here saying, "Lord, I got mud on my
[1:01:12] face. What could I witness? What could I
[1:01:15] tell anyone?" They would look at me and
[1:01:17] they'll see mud on my face. But I tell
[1:01:19] you, the word says that we're trophies.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you feel like a trophy tonight?
[1:01:25] Amen. We should just go ahead. If you
[1:01:27] don't feel like it tonight, just claim
[1:01:28] it anyhow. I'm a trophy. Amen. Of God's
[1:01:32] grace. Amen.
[1:01:35] Now, also, we don't want to do this. We
[1:01:37] don't want to make a quick sale of it. I
[1:01:39] think you guys will like this. Are you
[1:01:40] familiar with this quote? Any of you?
[1:01:42] Yeah. Don't want to make a quick sale of
[1:01:44] it. Just say, "Well, I got converted
[1:01:46] last night. Hallelujah. The whole
[1:01:48] world." You can't do that. That's a
[1:01:49] quick sale. If we do that, the product
[1:01:52] is not much good. If we just live good,
[1:01:55] say, I know one time I lived good for
[1:01:57] two weeks after I was converted. That's
[1:02:00] what I can boast about. After I got
[1:02:02] converted, I made it two whole weeks.
[1:02:06] Well, I tell you, sometimes that's how
[1:02:09] Christians live. Got a little besetting
[1:02:12] sin, got a little something in their
[1:02:13] life, and oh, I made it two weeks. I've
[1:02:16] overcome this. Week number three looks
[1:02:18] like I'm sorry that it was released from
[1:02:20] the gates of hell
[1:02:22] because we thought we had done
[1:02:24] something.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; We got to let the Lord do it,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I live two I I lived two weeks just a
[1:02:31] perfect life. That's a quick sale.
[1:02:34] That's like this had that we just had.
[1:02:38] Nothing but a bunch of vitamins wrapped
[1:02:40] up together and it didn't last but a
[1:02:43] little while. It finally went out. You
[1:02:46] want to be an everyday
[1:02:49] Christian.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not being judgmental, but I've met
[1:02:53] many people that just moved into such a
[1:02:55] spiritual realm, I couldn't even
[1:02:56] comprehend them. I I'm I'm like, man,
[1:03:01] Lord, I I don't know if I'm missing the
[1:03:03] point. Should I be like them? I I I want
[1:03:07] to be spiritual, but I'm sorry. You guys
[1:03:10] know me. I I'm a nuts and bolts guy. My
[1:03:13] heart might be jumping. My soul might be
[1:03:15] jumping all over the place and and it
[1:03:17] looks like I have lead feet.
[1:03:20] And then you'll see people practically
[1:03:22] bouncing off the back of the pews and
[1:03:24] running the aisle. But my brother and
[1:03:26] sister, if they only go for a little
[1:03:28] while and burn out.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Then what was what was that? Was it what
[1:03:37] we want to be? No. Brother Brandham
[1:03:40] says, "Just want to be an everyday
[1:03:43] Christian,
[1:03:45] every hour Christian, every year
[1:03:49] Christian, not a quick sale."
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; But let your light so shine if you walk
[1:03:54] up to a man and ask him to receive
[1:03:56] Christ and he laughs in your face. Don't
[1:03:58] go off and say, "Well, there's nothing
[1:04:00] to it." Or he would have accepted it.
[1:04:02] No, that's a hadacle sale. We're not
[1:04:05] selling hadacle. Now, do you know what
[1:04:07] had?
[1:04:09] In the mid 20th century,
[1:04:12] there was a man who put together a whole
[1:04:15] bunch of vitamins and stuff and put it
[1:04:19] all together and it was supposedly going
[1:04:21] to make you healthy, give you more
[1:04:23] energy and strength. And and the reviews
[1:04:27] on that were it probably did make people
[1:04:29] feel better because it was half alcohol.
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:35] So, no wonder when they drank it, they
[1:04:37] said, "Wow,
[1:04:39] boy, that put fire in my veins. This is
[1:04:42] good stuff." But after a while, it faded
[1:04:45] away because it wasn't a real solution.
[1:04:49] It wasn't a real answer. It was a quick
[1:04:52] sale.
[1:04:53] They even the man who had this even did,
[1:04:56] you know, the medicine wagon, go around,
[1:04:58] have all the displays and do all the
[1:05:00] thing. My brother and sister, all of
[1:05:02] that was great. kind of reminds you of
[1:05:04] revivals in a way. Amen. You guys are
[1:05:07] all going to feel better. Praise God.
[1:05:08] Jump up and run, shout, scream. Amen.
[1:05:12] But
[1:05:13] in a week, has anything changed?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So if it's there, we'll look at this.
[1:05:27] We're selling the gospel, not had
[1:05:33] Not a little natural spirit to make you
[1:05:37] feel better.
[1:05:40] Now, I haven't drank much alcohol in my
[1:05:42] whole life. Thank you, Lord. But I do
[1:05:45] remember a time when I was quite young
[1:05:47] that I was offered some whiskey and I
[1:05:50] took a drink of whiskey. Hopefully, you
[1:05:52] don't kick me out over this.
[1:05:55] And I'm telling you, it burns on the way
[1:05:58] down. Any of you who have ever drank
[1:06:01] any, you would know it burns on the way
[1:06:04] down, but when you get up tomorrow, it
[1:06:07] didn't change a single thing.
[1:06:09] There was inspiration at the moment, but
[1:06:12] it didn't change a single thing in your
[1:06:14] life. In fact, it probably just became a
[1:06:15] camouflage for your problem.
[1:06:18] So, Brother Brown saying, we're we're
[1:06:21] not just trying to do a quick sale.
[1:06:23] We're not trying to just, oh, fill the
[1:06:26] church up. You will not believe the
[1:06:28] amount of literature. It's tapered off
[1:06:30] now, but the amount of stuff I get on
[1:06:33] how to double the size of your church in
[1:06:36] three months. I thought about applying
[1:06:38] it just to see if it worked, but then
[1:06:40] we'd have to go back to preaching the
[1:06:42] truth and they would all leave.
[1:06:45] So, it won't do any good. But you see
[1:06:48] how they're approaching it? It's like a
[1:06:50] quick fix. You You can do this, you can
[1:06:52] do that. You can have daycare for single
[1:06:55] mothers and you can have sports events
[1:06:57] and you can have dances and you can have
[1:06:59] concerts and you can do it's a quick
[1:07:02] fix.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; But God's not wanting a quick fix, my
[1:07:05] brother and sister. Brother Ram says
[1:07:07] here, "We're selling the gospel, the
[1:07:09] power of the living God. Christ the same
[1:07:11] yesterday, today, and forever. If the
[1:07:13] world hates you, they hated Christ
[1:07:15] before they hated you. For the same
[1:07:17] cause drove him to the cross, but we're
[1:07:19] his representative. We're his
[1:07:22] billboards. We advertise him.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I want to be a true
[1:07:29] advertisement. Amen. Do you know that
[1:07:32] there they they do a lot of survey stuff
[1:07:34] on college campuses? And uh they're
[1:07:37] asking a lot of college kids why they
[1:07:41] are turned off about serving God and
[1:07:43] going to church. And anybody have an
[1:07:47] idea what their response is?
[1:07:51] hypocrisy.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; They say
[1:07:56] that they're Christians,
[1:07:58] but they're just like us.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; False advertising. Yeah, that's right.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; No wonder that kids are cynical
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; about it cuz they look at this somebody
[1:08:12] that's supposed to be saved, delivered,
[1:08:14] and this, you know, washed by the water
[1:08:16] of the word and and all they see is
[1:08:18] somebody is just like I am or worse.
[1:08:20] Yeah.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; So, see, we're billboards.
[1:08:24] And as a billboard, we must imagine now
[1:08:28] if they were really alive, a billboard
[1:08:30] once in a while might have to just take
[1:08:32] a peek over the top and see what is it
[1:08:34] I'm advertising this week,
[1:08:36] right?
[1:08:38] But everybody driving down the freeway
[1:08:40] knows what's being advertised. They see
[1:08:43] it.
[1:08:44] I think the preaching of the word
[1:08:45] sometimes just comes and brings us to a
[1:08:48] reminder of what we're advertising.
[1:08:50] That's
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; We're talking about serving God, a
[1:08:53] revelation of a message in this hour.
[1:08:56] Amen. Let our life, our billboard
[1:08:59] proclaim it. Not let it be hypocrisy.
[1:09:02] Let it just be the truth. Let it just be
[1:09:05] you. Don't go out and say, "I'm going to
[1:09:07] prove to these people what a great
[1:09:08] Christian I am." Just be a Christian
[1:09:11] today, this week, this year. Let the
[1:09:14] revelation of Christ in you shine.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think we all need a little
[1:09:21] reminder of that every once in a while,
[1:09:23] right?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We advertise him. Now, let
[1:09:27] me move right along here. Amen.
[1:09:32] So, I I I want you, you know, this is
[1:09:33] what caught me in in this this sermon.
[1:09:36] Brother Brandham talking about that's a
[1:09:38] quick sale. We're not here to do a quick
[1:09:41] sale. We want to see people. We're not
[1:09:43] here to say we filled our church up on
[1:09:45] Sunday. We're here to say the sons and
[1:09:49] daughters of God are hungry for the word
[1:09:51] come into the house of God and are fed.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Now, we were having this little
[1:09:56] conversation.
[1:09:58] God knew what it would be like. Saints,
[1:10:01] he didn't say where two or 30 hundred
[1:10:04] are gathered in my name. That's right.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered in my
[1:10:10] name. He brought it right down to the
[1:10:12] barest bones.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a brother here just a
[1:10:17] few days ago.
[1:10:19] We were discussing along this
[1:10:22] and it's interesting
[1:10:24] because in the conversation I recounted
[1:10:26] a time many years ago Wednesday night we
[1:10:30] were over uh by where the police station
[1:10:33] is now. Wednesday night,
[1:10:36] we go there, turn the lights on, turn
[1:10:39] the music on, Sister Jerry, my daughter
[1:10:42] Kristen,
[1:10:44] and the clock ticks down, and it ticks
[1:10:46] 7:30.
[1:10:49] Well, people are running late tonight.
[1:10:52] 7:35,
[1:10:55] 7:40,
[1:10:57] 7:45.
[1:10:59] I hate to admit this, but God was
[1:11:01] teaching a lesson.
[1:11:03] My first thought is,
[1:11:05] let's fold it all up,
[1:11:08] turn the lights off, let's go home. But
[1:11:12] the Lord spoke to me and said, "Wherever
[1:11:15] two or three
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; are gathered in my name."
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know we're human, right? So, we
[1:11:21] like to see a great turnout on a
[1:11:23] Wednesday night. Thank you for coming
[1:11:24] tonight. God bless you. But it changed
[1:11:28] my life. and I have been in different
[1:11:31] places and and we've traveled and done
[1:11:34] and we have just spoke to a little
[1:11:36] handful and by God's grace I want to
[1:11:39] pour all the light that's been poured
[1:11:41] into me. I want to pour it out not
[1:11:43] because there's more people. I was just
[1:11:45] talking to another young man here just
[1:11:48] starting his ministry and he was going,
[1:11:50] "Oh, you know, Brother Paul, it's just
[1:11:52] when there's just a just so many people.
[1:11:55] I get nervous when there's so many
[1:11:57] people." And I said, "Brother," I said,
[1:11:59] "This is the way I see it. It's easier
[1:12:01] to preach to a whole church full of
[1:12:03] people than it is to two or three."
[1:12:06] That's right.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Because two or three are looking at you.
[1:12:10] And we're human. We tend to look at who
[1:12:12] we're preaching at. And imagine, we'll
[1:12:13] just take the front row here. There's
[1:12:15] nobody else in the building and you're
[1:12:17] preaching. You're not going to go, "And
[1:12:18] God was speaking to somebody." No,
[1:12:21] you're going to focus right in on that
[1:12:23] and you're going to see every
[1:12:25] expression. And maybe you're not going
[1:12:27] to like it, right?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're thinking, "He's so
[1:12:36] boring." But it's the truth. Amen.
[1:12:40] Come on. You know that happens. People
[1:12:42] say amen because it's the truth, not
[1:12:43] because it's interesting.
[1:12:46] So, you know, uh th those of you that
[1:12:48] are honest with yourselves will say
[1:12:50] there's been times you said amen to the
[1:12:52] word, not because what was preached was
[1:12:54] inspiring, but because it was truth.
[1:12:56] Amen. Thank you for the amens.
[1:12:59] Now, look at this, my brother and
[1:13:01] sister. What God is doing, he's not
[1:13:03] wanting us to come to a place that we
[1:13:06] have to be entertained, that we have to
[1:13:08] have something that we never heard
[1:13:10] before. And you know, if we're not
[1:13:12] careful as ministers, the devil will try
[1:13:14] to come and say, "You know what? You've
[1:13:16] been you've preached along this theme.
[1:13:17] You've preached that, you know, you're
[1:13:19] just a boring preacher because that's
[1:13:21] the only thing you can preach." Well,
[1:13:22] remember what the prophet of God said.
[1:13:24] They said, "Brother brother Brandham,
[1:13:26] how long you going to keep Job on the
[1:13:27] ash heap?" And I'm paraphrasing it.
[1:13:30] Until you get the revelation of why he
[1:13:32] was on an ash heap, I'll keep him on the
[1:13:34] ash heap. You know, but we want
[1:13:36] something new and something that is
[1:13:39] entertaining in a sense of expanding our
[1:13:42] thinking and God wants us to get it.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; He wants us to get it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let me hurry along here. Amen.
[1:13:52] So,
[1:13:54] the scripture says that we should not
[1:13:56] become weary and welloing. Now I I want
[1:13:59] you tonight, nobody needs to raise a
[1:14:02] hand, but I want you to just in your
[1:14:04] heart, if that's the truth, raise a hand
[1:14:05] in your heart. We feel burnt out.
[1:14:09] There's pressures in Leodysia.
[1:14:12] There's things that happen in the world
[1:14:13] today. And if we're not careful, we get
[1:14:17] this jaded feeling
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; and we're looking for something to
[1:14:22] inspire us.
[1:14:26] Now my brother and sister, just the pure
[1:14:29] word of God should be inspiration
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; to us.
[1:14:34] It's the light. It's not a fancy
[1:14:37] presentation.
[1:14:39] Look, I had a brother one time. He was
[1:14:42] doing the barbecuing. We got distracted.
[1:14:44] It was my fault. I claimed the blame
[1:14:47] because we got distracted and then all
[1:14:50] of a sudden he jumped up and said, "Oh
[1:14:51] my, the chicken." And he ran off to the
[1:14:53] barbecue. And anyway, we had a little
[1:14:55] bit of a religious service that night
[1:14:57] because we had a burnt offering. But you
[1:15:00] look at that, my brother and sister. You
[1:15:02] see,
[1:15:04] we don't need to have something that
[1:15:08] just thrills us
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; every service,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; We need to feed on what God presents to
[1:15:17] us. And by the way, that brother that he
[1:15:20] thought he had destroyed his chicken, it
[1:15:22] was some of the best chicken I've ever
[1:15:24] eaten. It was it was smoked,
[1:15:28] but it was it was tasty. It was
[1:15:30] beautiful. It was great. And when we
[1:15:32] left that night, he was apologizing the
[1:15:34] whole time. I destroyed the meal. I'm so
[1:15:36] sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't convince
[1:15:37] him that black on the outside, juicy on
[1:15:41] the inside was still good. Now, my
[1:15:44] brother and sister, we don't need to be
[1:15:46] sold a quick sale. We need to sit down
[1:15:50] and say, "Lord, I want something that
[1:15:52] will last through this week. I want
[1:15:54] something that will last through the the
[1:15:56] hard trials, the hard times. I I want
[1:15:59] something that will last when me and the
[1:16:01] wife, as brother Greg Aler says, have
[1:16:03] some intense fellowship.
[1:16:05] I I I want something that will last
[1:16:07] through intense fellowship at work,
[1:16:11] whatever it might be.
[1:16:13] So, we look at this. We're selling the
[1:16:15] gospel. Now, Brother Bram's words could
[1:16:18] be misconstrued as though we're selling
[1:16:20] some kind of bill of goods, but we as
[1:16:22] the bride of Christ understand exactly
[1:16:25] what he's saying. We're not here being
[1:16:27] critical of his words because we're
[1:16:30] understanding that my life is the
[1:16:34] representation
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:38] And if my life isn't representing him,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; there should be no question why nobody
[1:16:43] wants it.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; But when our life represents it,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; you don't have to sell it. It will sell
[1:16:51] itself.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I knew a man now. Now, Brother Eric,
[1:16:54] he's been in the copier business. Are
[1:16:56] you still in the copier business? Yes.
[1:16:58] Brother Eric's been in the copier
[1:17:00] business and and I'm going to put him on
[1:17:01] the spot here a little bit.
[1:17:03] uh you know when they lived up in
[1:17:05] Canada, we stayed with them, visited,
[1:17:07] fellowshipped with them. And you know,
[1:17:09] if brother Eric just did his job, the
[1:17:11] people come back to him. He didn't have
[1:17:14] to go out and resell the product every
[1:17:16] time he seen the customer. They actually
[1:17:19] says, "This is a good product and it's
[1:17:21] good service and we like what you do."
[1:17:24] And obviously, Brother Eric has a talent
[1:17:26] to be able to deal with people in that
[1:17:27] sense. But my brother and sister, if you
[1:17:30] have a good product and lousy service,
[1:17:33] you're going to have to resell that
[1:17:34] thing every single time. Amen. And
[1:17:37] you're going to have great service and a
[1:17:39] lousy product and sooner or later you're
[1:17:42] going to lose it. So now the gospel has
[1:17:45] come and revelation in you and I is not
[1:17:48] that we have some new thing that we've
[1:17:51] got to go run out into the desert,
[1:17:53] right? It's right there in scripture.
[1:17:54] You know, they went out in the desert
[1:17:56] and it fell apart. They went out in the
[1:17:58] desert and it fell apart. But when you
[1:18:00] have the life, my brother and sister,
[1:18:02] God will allow them to go in the desert
[1:18:05] and come back.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; They'll have a desert experience.
[1:18:08] Anybody had a desert experience? You'll
[1:18:11] have a desert experience, but God is in
[1:18:14] it. And you will come back. You don't go
[1:18:17] out to the desert and die. You come
[1:18:20] back. And God proves to you, you can go
[1:18:22] to the desert and you can come back.
[1:18:25] Amen. You can live through this desert
[1:18:28] called Leodysa and still come back and
[1:18:30] serve God. Amen. Let me hurry up and
[1:18:33] finish this. Amen. So, we're not called
[1:18:36] to burn out, disappear. We're called
[1:18:38] Amen. And so, we wonder why people are
[1:18:41] turned off. Now, Psalm 60:es 1-4. Oh
[1:18:45] God, thou hast cast us off. Thou hast
[1:18:48] scattered us. Thou hast been displeased.
[1:18:52] He's talking about my life right there.
[1:18:55] Oh, turn thyself to us again. Thou hast
[1:18:58] made the earth to tremble. Thou hast
[1:19:01] broken it. Heal the breaches thereof,
[1:19:04] for it shaketh. Thou hast showed thy
[1:19:07] people hard things.
[1:19:13] Is there an amen in the house?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; We've been shown hard things. Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of
[1:19:25] astonishment.
[1:19:27] Thou hast given a banner to them that
[1:19:31] fear thee that it may be displayed
[1:19:34] because of the truth.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Why do we have something to go out and
[1:19:39] say, "You guys need to serve God? Is it
[1:19:42] because we're so smart, so good-looking,
[1:19:44] so this, so that?" No, we have a banner
[1:19:49] of truth that needs to be displayed in
[1:19:53] this day. Amen. There are people that
[1:19:56] want to hear about the gospel. They
[1:19:59] don't want to be told they're sinners.
[1:20:01] They don't want to be told they're lost.
[1:20:02] They don't want to be told there's no
[1:20:04] hope for them. They actually want to
[1:20:06] hear the word and it give them
[1:20:09] encouragement. And when God has their
[1:20:12] attention,
[1:20:13] he will correct all of these other
[1:20:16] things. But our problem, I'm not going
[1:20:19] to blame it on the message, but we
[1:20:21] certainly have a bad dose of it. We want
[1:20:23] to clean them before we've ever caught
[1:20:25] them. Imagine the fisherman don't even
[1:20:28] have a lure on his pole. He's standing
[1:20:30] on the beach sharpening his cleaning
[1:20:32] knife. Be able to flay these fish that
[1:20:35] I've never caught. No, my brother and
[1:20:38] sister. God wants us to live that life
[1:20:41] that they can see that this revelation
[1:20:43] that is in us is not just a human flash
[1:20:47] in the pan but it is Christ himself
[1:20:50] changing you and I. Amen. I can say
[1:20:53] thank you Lord that the evidence is
[1:20:55] there. Amen. The gospel on display.
[1:20:59] Amen. Now there's nothing greater than
[1:21:02] to see something that actually works.
[1:21:05] Amen. if you're if you're you know got a
[1:21:08] product you know uh you have something
[1:21:10] uh uh that that you're selling and um
[1:21:14] you know it's interesting in days gone
[1:21:16] by I don't want to get nostalgic and get
[1:21:18] off here but in days gone by it used to
[1:21:20] be if they come around the farm they
[1:21:22] would say hey this stuff breaks the rust
[1:21:24] loose from bolts and um it works now
[1:21:29] it's a little spendy but it works
[1:21:33] use it and call us when you want to
[1:21:35] order it.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; But now they come and say, "This is the
[1:21:40] best snake. I mean, best stuff.
[1:21:45] It's only $35 a can. Trust us."
[1:21:53] You wonder why in the world that that
[1:21:56] fellow employee or that boss or that
[1:21:59] person,
[1:22:00] they want to take your life for a test
[1:22:02] drive.
[1:22:04] Oh, maybe we could even come down to
[1:22:05] husbands and wives and children. They
[1:22:08] want to take your life for a test drive
[1:22:11] because they've trusted and been
[1:22:13] disappointed again and again and again.
[1:22:18] What they want to see is a real Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; with flesh on
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; in this day living.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; All I can say is is Lord help me.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] Let the revelation we can talk about. I
[1:22:35] have revelations of of the first pull,
[1:22:38] second pull, third pull, the seals I of
[1:22:41] the vials. I have revelations of this
[1:22:44] and of that and of the Hebrews and all
[1:22:46] of this. And if you live like a well, I
[1:22:49] don't know. I I'll just leave that to
[1:22:51] your imagin. You fill in that blank. You
[1:22:53] live like whatever. And none of that
[1:22:55] speaks of revelation.
[1:22:59] You're never going to be able to witness
[1:23:01] to that person.
[1:23:03] But you might be one of the simplest
[1:23:06] people on earth and you have a
[1:23:09] revelation
[1:23:10] of all of those things
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; and it's real.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Your life
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; will speak.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And they'll want it.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I've shared this before in the church as
[1:23:23] I close.
[1:23:25] There's a brother back east. I imagine
[1:23:27] he's passed away by now. This been quite
[1:23:29] a few years ago.
[1:23:33] And uh somebody had mentioned to him,
[1:23:34] you know, it's too bad, brother. You
[1:23:36] spent your whole life. He was living. He
[1:23:38] he had a lot of children. I don't
[1:23:40] remember now exactly how many, like 10,
[1:23:42] 12 children. And and him and his wife
[1:23:45] just took time living with each family,
[1:23:48] his children. Somebody one day said to
[1:23:50] him, "It's a shame that you lived your
[1:23:53] whole life out and um and here in your
[1:23:56] retirement, you you don't even have your
[1:23:58] own house. you don't have anything. You
[1:24:01] know, it's just a shame that you're so
[1:24:02] poor."
[1:24:05] This brother looked at him and said,
[1:24:06] "Poor?"
[1:24:09] He said, "I have 12 children. They're
[1:24:11] married." And he had some crazy number
[1:24:14] of grandchildren, like 75,
[1:24:17] you imagine, birthdays.
[1:24:21] No wonder he's poor.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Poor?"
[1:24:26] He said, 'Yes, I don't have a house.
[1:24:30] I don't have any anything,
[1:24:32] but I've got 12 children, 12 sons and
[1:24:36] daughters and laws. I got all these
[1:24:39] grandchildren, and they all serve God.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm the richest man on earth.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You see, there's a man who had a
[1:24:50] revelation what this is all about.
[1:24:54] I pray Lord let us have that revelation.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It's not about our houses, not about our
[1:24:59] lands, not about our bank accounts.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all going to go up in smoke.
[1:25:05] Oh, just to encourage all of you
[1:25:06] tonight, there's a growing number of
[1:25:09] countries in the world, economies in the
[1:25:11] world that are talking about ditching
[1:25:13] the dollar. And so, you know what that's
[1:25:17] going to do to the dollar when they
[1:25:18] ditch the dollar? this bankrupt nation
[1:25:21] we live in will actually have to
[1:25:23] acknowledge it's bankrupt because it's
[1:25:25] not going to have anything to prop it
[1:25:27] up. Now, did that make you happy or sad?
[1:25:33] Should have made you happy.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Because this nation we have Oh, why do
[1:25:40] you call this a revelation, brother
[1:25:41] Paul? Because it was revealed to us.
[1:25:45] This nation must be broke. It must sell
[1:25:48] itself.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Going right back in scripture.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Must sell itself.
[1:25:59] Where's our rest?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Where's our peace? Where's our comfort?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Let it not be.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; In the things of this world.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Let it be in Jesus Christ. Sister Ruth,
[1:26:10] would you come? Amen.
[1:26:15] I like this. If you don't mind, I want
[1:26:16] to go ahead and do this last quote that
[1:26:18] I have right here. Um,
[1:26:22] uh, well, not the last, I guess. I
[1:26:24] shouldn't say it that way. The token.
[1:26:25] Amen. Sorry about that. I I like this
[1:26:28] one.
[1:26:30] We're not to come together to talk about
[1:26:32] the message.
[1:26:34] We're to come together to get in the
[1:26:36] message.
[1:26:38] Too often we talk about it.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; But it's time for us to get in it. And
[1:26:43] the message is Christ.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; So people in the world today, especially
[1:26:49] naysayers, you guys are following a man
[1:26:52] and I say, "Yep, I sure am." His name is
[1:26:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's who I follow. That's the
[1:27:01] movement that I've got in. Now, if you
[1:27:04] look at this, let me throw this in. If
[1:27:06] you look at the definition of a cult,
[1:27:09] you'll find that they're all flinging
[1:27:11] this. They're in a cult. I was delivered
[1:27:13] from a cult. I escaped from a cult.
[1:27:15] You'll find that the old English
[1:27:17] definition of a cult, every church
[1:27:20] religion on the face of the earth is a
[1:27:22] cult.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Only they use it as a slur word to make
[1:27:28] it you look bad while they look good.
[1:27:31] But most of them are in more of a cult
[1:27:34] than you are.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; So don't get defensive when somebody
[1:27:39] says you're in a cult. say, "You're
[1:27:41] absolutely right. I'm following Jesus
[1:27:43] Christ, and he's got total control over
[1:27:46] my life. I do what he tells me to do. I
[1:27:50] go where he tells me to go. I give when
[1:27:52] he tells me to give."
[1:27:55] They won't know how to answer you cuz
[1:27:58] they want to put human flesh, a man in
[1:28:02] that. But that's not what God's doing.
[1:28:04] The message is Christ.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; He is the word. That's right. and we get
[1:28:09] into it and get beneath it. Yes, sir.
[1:28:12] That's what we're supposed to do. He was
[1:28:14] not responsible for any persons out from
[1:28:16] under the blood. Not one. No matter who
[1:28:18] he was, he was not responsible. All had
[1:28:21] to take not only himself but his whole
[1:28:23] family. They're only safe when the token
[1:28:27] was displayed. We cannot feel safe until
[1:28:30] the token, this token is displayed.
[1:28:32] That's right. You must come under this
[1:28:35] token, God's Holy Spirit.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what I want that part.
[1:28:38] I wanted to read a whole thing that that
[1:28:41] my brother and sister don't get
[1:28:42] comfortable if you're not under the
[1:28:45] blood. If there's things in our lives
[1:28:48] that we are not don't have not dealt
[1:28:51] with, have not put in the right place,
[1:28:53] let it be a revelation to you that it's
[1:28:56] easier to live without condemnation than
[1:29:01] it is to live with it. But I must make
[1:29:04] things right. You'll want to make it
[1:29:07] right someday.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Make it right now.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Let it be a revelation, saints, that we
[1:29:13] want to, as the early quote said, we
[1:29:15] want to live a life with not a mark on
[1:29:18] us in the day that we're living in. Let
[1:29:21] that be a revelation. Well, I can
[1:29:23] explain the seals. I can explain the
[1:29:24] vials. I can explain. My brother and
[1:29:26] sister, if we're living a life with a
[1:29:28] mark on it, it won't matter what you can
[1:29:31] explain.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Let's just get under the blood. Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; It's so easy. It's so wonderful. God is
[1:29:39] so gracious. All we have to do is say,
[1:29:41] "Lord, forgive me." And move into that
[1:29:44] position. Amen. Is it good to be here in
[1:29:46] the house of the Lord tonight? Amen. You
[1:29:49] know, I didn't even have a single song.
[1:29:52] Um, so I'm going to have to ask brother
[1:29:54] I Alex to to um just come. Um,
[1:30:00] you know, I want to take this little
[1:30:02] statement, put it this way.
[1:30:06] Revelation is as revelation does. And so
[1:30:11] my brother and sister, when we say we
[1:30:12] got revelation,
[1:30:14] let that revelation bring action in our
[1:30:17] life.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And let that word change us. Amen. Oh,
[1:30:21] how I want to be changed.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord's done so much. My He's
[1:30:26] done so much in our lives. Let's lift a
[1:30:28] hand and acknowledge and say, "Thank
[1:30:29] you, Lord, for what you've done in our
[1:30:31] lives, but I want to change more. I want
[1:30:34] more. Amen. God bless you tonight,
[1:30:36] saints. We love you in the Lord.
[1:30:38] Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:45] God bless you.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um,
[1:30:51] can you search up Let the Death Angel
[1:30:54] Pass?
[1:31:06] This one.
[1:31:08] The Lord spoke to Moses
[1:31:14] and told what to say
[1:31:20] to the children of Israel
[1:31:26] in Goan that day.
[1:31:31] Slay the lamb, take the blood.
[1:31:37] Strike the post at the door.
[1:31:43] For I'll pass
[1:31:45] Egypt this night
[1:31:49] and smite all the firstborn.
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:55] Let the death angel pass.
[1:32:01] God's brides free at last
[1:32:06] in the token he gave
[1:32:12] that we could be saved.
[1:32:18] Oh hallelujah
[1:32:24] and glory to God.
[1:32:29] The blood's been applied. His spirit
[1:32:34] abides. Let the death angel pass.
[1:32:41] The sweet Holy Spirit
[1:32:47] is the token today.
[1:32:52] And those who are underra,
[1:32:58] God said would be saved.
[1:33:04] Outside of this token,
[1:33:09] the lost will be found.
[1:33:15] If your
[1:33:17] loved ones saved,
[1:33:20] you better get them in now.
[1:33:25] Oh, let the death angel pass.
[1:33:31] God's brides free at last.
[1:33:37] and the token he gave
[1:33:43] that we could be saved.
[1:33:49] Oh hallelujah
[1:33:54] and glory to God.
[1:33:59] The blood's been applied. His spirit
[1:34:03] abides. Let the death angel pass.
[1:34:09] Amen. Um I don't think I've ever sang
[1:34:12] that song, so sorry if it's wrong.
[1:34:15] That's the only way I know it. Thank
[1:34:16] you, Sister Ruth. Um
