scripture that's gonna be my remark in ecclesiastics the second chapter the 22nd chapter the first verse it reads thusly a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver or gold hallelujah this young man had a good name and uh personally he helped me so many times with my television show and all kinds of things it says whenever you need help young daniel was there he had a good name but when i think about what this scripture says about having a good name you know the only way we can have a good name is that we got to do good amen and the only thing that make us do good the only good thing in us is the holy ghost and that good name that make us do good that name is jesus and so every time when i see the things that was done over the years all i could see is that good name see there's power in that good name it's healing in that good name it's deliverance in that good name that good name is a living epistle for us hallelujah and i thank god

everyone love the lord jesus christ for the blessing upon us to be here on today amen we give on to the pastor of this church all the members of the clergy members of the family we thank god for your presence here on today amen certainly we have come on occasion that's with mixed feelings with many uh sadness and joy apprehension say apprehension because a lot of times when time for preaching people started wondering what the preacher gonna say amen uh thank god for the simmons family i've known this family the paternal and maternal side for about three generations all the way from charlotte down to south chocolate florida amen and we thank god for all of them and you know coming here today as i look around uh it looks almost like a family reunion now some of you know what i'm talking about some may not amen but we thank god for you on today in your presence that's here and amen we thank the past for giving this opportunity to share with you a man from the word of the lord on today i will sing a song but uh yeah they tell me i can't say no no no the bible says you're not the temptation am i growing up in the church they put me off the choir ate my hand so but god has been good to us and we thank god for that today i want to speak to not just the family but all of us a man we've heard many uh words of expressions of love adoration and most certainly daniel will be missed from our midst i've known him all of his life amen his parents grandparents uncles and aunts and we thank god for the opportunity we have today to share with you on behalf of the lord jesus christ and my word from the lord to us that's here today if you have your bibles you can turn to matthew chapter 19. verse 16 through verse 22. matthew chapter 19 [Music] verses 16 through verse 22. and behold one came i said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that may have eternal life and they said unto him while because thou mean good there's only one good and that is god amen but if you want to have eternal life keep his commandments and he said unto him which and jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not be a false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shall have and love thy neighbor as thyself a young man said unto him yeah i've done this all my life since i was a youth what else do i like and jesus said unto him if i would be perfect go and sell that with our house and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me give away all your money all your riches and then come follow me but when the young man heard that sin he went away sorrowfully for he had great possessions he had a lot of wealth and now he's been asked if you want to have eternal life you've got to give it away and come follow me what have you given away for following christ to follow him amen a subject today in the form of a question where would you spend eternity where would you spend eternity do you need a minute to think about it have you ever thought about it where would you spend eternity amen we just read this young man want to know who and what he must do to have eternal life amen eternal life is always linked to one or two things heaven or hell amen and this is the question every one of us know the answer to you sit here today you know if you die today you know whether or not you go to heaven or hell amen and one thing i say to people often don't fool your own self amen this is a thought-provoking question that we all have the answers to amen and jesus while on earth told the disciples and the pastors and he gave unto them amen this promise amen in john 14 1-9 i go to prepare a place for you i will come again to receive unto myself you know when the story went on and jesus explained to them amen that he was going to get a place ready we commonly call that place heaven amen where we all want to spend eternity and jesus said i'm going to prepare that place for you and i'm going to come back see nobody's going to heaven amen you're going to be taken to heaven that's the only way you're going to get there and jesus said i'm going to come again and i'm going to receive unto myself that where i am there you may be also and the way you should know the sabbath i say well lord we don't know the way amen tell us what is the way and jesus said i am the way i'm the truth and i'm the life no man come to the father but by me then another disciple asked him well lord you know you talk about the father you know show us the father and we'll be satisfied and jesus has i've been this long time with you and yet thou have not known me amen when you see me you see the father so why ask me to show you the father you're looking at him and this is a problem that trinitarians have understanding that jesus is god amen he's the father in creation the son the redemption and the holy ghost in the church and in the believers but still it is one god amen if the day was the day of the rapture are you ready if the ratchet will take place at this very moment are you ready and i i'm assuming that most of us understand and know what the word rapture means what we're talking about the rapture that's when the lord come back for the church for his bride amen and take us back with him that's how we come back amen when the dead in christ will get out of the grave and all of us together will go to meet him in the air if that was today are you ready for the rapture at this very moment is there anything you need to go and get straightened out anything you need to go and undo that you can make the rapture amen the question still is and i'll get to that shortly where will you spend eternity and jesus gave us plenty of time to get ready if you got saved yesterday it might and the right to come today you had enough time to be prepared amen what are we using the time that he has given you how are you using that time amen it's something that people waste but nothing as much as they waste time putting off procrastinating making promises to themself that they don't keep amen promising i'm going to do better i'm going to do this i'm going to do that and sometime in the midst of all these decisions one trying to make win i'm going to get these things accomplished when am i going to get to be a better person you know jesus gave all of us a lot of time to get prepared you mind how are you using the time that he's giving you amen how do you use your time yesterday those 24 hours yesterday how did you use it hey man if you're 25 years of age what have you accomplished are done in those 25 years to get prepared for the rapture to get prepared for the coming of the lord or to get prepared to die second kings chapter 20 second kings the 20th chapter and i want you to consider what the word of god says here in the word of god in the book of second kings chapter 20. we all are familiar with hezekiah and i'm sure we have heard messages from this book you read these scriptures yourself so i'm going to read it to us again from second kings chapter 20 verse 1 to verse 7. in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amos came to him and said unto him thus said the lord set your house in order for thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying i beseech thee oh lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept saw and they came to pass before isaiah was gone amen and to the middle coat that the word of the lord came to isaiah and said unto him turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i've heard thy prayer have seen thy tears behold i will hear thee on the third day that thou shall go up to the throne of the lord and i will add unto thy days 15 years amen 15 more years to live uh hezekiah was the king of israel and you're taken sick and the lord told a prophet isaiah go and tell hezekiah to get his house in order he didn't give him much time that's why we ought to stay ready amen because today he's going to die and not live and when hezekiah heard this he began to cry and it turned his face to the wall and began to talk to the lord lord you know how i have tried to walk up right before you i have a perfect heart i try to keep your word in your will and then he turned his face to the wall and began to weep and the bible said he wept sore i mean he was really crying because he did not want to die and the lord spoke to isaiah said isaiah turn around and go back and tell hezekiah i heard his prayers and tell him i'm going to give him 15 more years to live amen and can you imagine what hezekiah must have felt in knowing i have 50 more years to live amen when hezekiah heard this and my message from isaiah the first message was set your house in order you're not talking about his fi his palace he's talking about his life be sure that you have it in order praise the lord and everyone does not always have experience like hezekiah amen to know when you're going to die see god told hezekiah you're going to die tonight if all of us knew today if you knew right now and you're going to die tonight what you have to get in order what would you have to change what would you have to do who do you have to go to and and ask forgiveness and what things you have to turn around and make am i in correction in some things because you don't have much time and i'm afraid that with some people and my time will run out because they have so much to sit in order if they knew they was going to die tonight amen so what about us if you knew tonight you're going to die at seven o'clock how would you spend the next three or four hours what would you busy doing amen hezekiah lived such a life amen the bible says he began to weep and he prayed to god and told the lord well lord you know i've tried to live a good life before you i've upheld your word and i lived according to your word amen and because of hezekiah's prayer and the life he had lived god given 15 more years but if today was your last day how much time do you think god will give you if any amen i've learned about preaching it should be something that is thought provoking it cause people to stop and to think amen see because once you're dead you cannot make any changes it's like the pecan tree in your yard you cut it down as a pea country when it hit the ground it's going to be a pecan tree next month is going to be a pecan tree and when i ride up it would be a rotten pecan tree it will not change death will not change you the changes must be done while we are living amen and god give us a lot of time amen we see all these gray hairs in here and 40 50 60 70 80 years of age then you see some teen years teenage years but what are you doing with your life are you preparing for eternity are you preparing for everlasting life amen hezekiah reminded god not that god had forgotten but out of his heart because hezekiah did not want to die and i'm sure today if the question will ask all of us you want to die today no hands will go up amen we got things we want to get done we have not accomplished it we want to further things on but if you knew you were saved and ready for death amen would you take that opportunity and say lord amen don't wait till tomorrow take me now amen heaven is waiting on me but when you're not sure when you have questions in your own mind whether or not you're really saved i've been baptized in jesus name i have the holy ghost amen and you say you're saved there are many sinners who were baptized in jesus name and filled with the holy ghost many backsliders and many liars been baptized in jesus name and filled with the holy ghost all the thieves have been baptized in water in the name of jesus christ but it's the quality of life that you live with the time that god gives to you amen that gives you that opportunity to have eternal life but hezekiah in his prayer to god amen and god does not have to be reminded but hezekiah was consoling himself you know i tried to live a good life i walked up right before you i've done right toward others i lived a good life amen and because of hezekiah's tears god sent him through isaiah 50 more years to live amen but then if you read the rest of the story what did hezekiah do in those other 15 years amen read the rest of the book amen hezekiah recovered from the sickness rose up had visited to come to visit him they heard what had happened to him and how he now had been healed and delivered amen and he went into the house of god in a place where they shouldn't have gone and showed them everything that was in there you mind sometimes in life we waste a lot of time some people spend more time looking for a job a better job than seeking more righteousness with god spent more time doing other things and not praying not fasting not walking up right before the lord so if the day was your last day how would you spend these last few hours if the rapture will come at any moment and it just might the rapture may come before the service is over if so are you ready for the rapture there's a saying that they use out in california a church where i started out there it was that you've got to be rapture ready or graveyard ready one of the others are going to come before one if you're rapture ready the grave don't hold no terror for the bloodborne one those who walk out right before god but what are you doing with your life now amen i go through a list of thing that we should be doing and have done can we all say to those things well lord i love all my brothers and sisters lord i don't line i don't steal lord i'm faithful in all things and we go down the list of the good things i've done but then god still says to us there may be something you're liking there is another man in the bible who experienced a decision to be made and he was prepared a man to go on living his life you know about the rich man amen and all the wealth that he could spend all of the money laying houses servants amen and the same rich man had a poor man lazarus who will come every day souls all over his body and sit at the gate and just hoping that someone will come out of the king's place and give him something to eat maybe the scraps left from what the dogs left behind just anything and this man pay no attention to lazarus and then the bible says the servant came and said master we got a good crop things are going well and good amen you're prospering and we got to tear down some little bonds and make bigger bonds to put all that you have into it you're making so much and what a tragedy that we live in now in our time when prices going up food getting scarce problems everywhere the money that you make a few years ago a few months ago that went in my a long wait doesn't go half that far any longer and people are struggling but how many has turned into god amen but this rich man trying to tell my little bonds and big bigger bonds and i can say to my soul so take it easy you got a nade now amen rest easy and then the lord said thy fool this very night your soul is required of you you're going to die amen what if god will say to you set your house in order in one hour you're going to die i'm sure this man who was rich if he could buy a ticket to heaven he was prepared amen but what have we stored up to give us an opportunity to have eternal life you know life is like a dollar bill of money you can only spend it one time amen you get a 20 bill you go to the store you can't spend it but one time life is the same way amen and life sometimes with some people is like going grocery shopping they invest all their money in some things and put very little in the bank but even in the bank when you write a check you can't spend it no more it's gone life is the same way what are we doing with our lives are we preparing for eternity are we walking up right before the lord are we seeking salvation are we seeking am i in a relationship with god amen because once death comes you can't make any changes you must do it now you cannot make any adjustments in life we must do it now that when that time come amen and it's a sad thing uh in life and those are who experience those things so we can understand and sympathize with amen those who lose a loved one amen when you're told it might you have a sickness you cannot be cured of many people fly from state to state sometime out of the country trying to find a cure amen but not spending much time and getting right with god setting that house in order so the question is where would you spend eternity if we took a poll today how many hands really go up say you know i'm going to go to heaven i want to go to heaven most hands will no one would dare to say amen i want to go to hell amen except the atheist amen but god is saying to us here today you have an opportunity and while you have that time set your house in order get right with god because you've been filled with the holy ghost and baptized in jesus name what about the condition of the heart amen what about the mind how much time you spend every day you're thinking on things that you shouldn't think on what about the eyes every day you go along and god give you 20 20 vision but how are you using that eyesight are you watching things that you should not watch are you looking at things that you should not look at what about our mouth how do we use it amen besides praising god and blessing god but when we finish blessing god and praising him how do you talk to your brother and sister or your neighbor or your friend or even your enemy making preparation for going on a trip we get things prepared we put clothes in the cleanser and get those prepared and search the internet for a good ticket a good price and make advanced hotel reservation put everything in order in place am i not thinking that i may not make this trip because god may send me an isaiah they tell me you're going to die people take living for granted amen bishops elders people take living for granted we are soon i'm going to be here tomorrow and in most cases that assumption is correct but what if it's wrong amen where would you spend eternity and eternity is a long time amen that's a long time how long is eternity as long as god will live and god's going to live forever you're always with god always will be god and no beginning of days no ending of time amen but i'm going to think about the consequences of wasting time not considering investing in where i'm going to spend eternity we look and we try to find a nice neighborhood to move to we're looking short for a nice car to buy at a good price but what about my soul what about my life that i'm living am i sending it in order that when the lord should come back at any moment when i lay down at night if the raptor come at two o'clock in the morning when i'm fast asleep would you be ready in the middle of the day on a weekend when the lord will come back for his church and the believers and the rapture comes and take us all away and we go back with him are you rapture ready amen where would you spend eternity there's only one or two places brothers and sisters and friends of mine there's only one of two places the options are not many you have only one or two to choose from and yes you choose you make a choice amen you see sin is optional sin is an option you have to decide to sin you have to make up your mind to sin amen let me say that again sin is optional in other words you don't have to sin amen then now the bible said let not sin reign in your mortal body don't you allow it it's an option you can do it if you want to you cannot and you don't have to do it if you don't want to god will not force us amen to live right and he will not allow satan to force us to do wrong when you choose to sin it's a choice that you make amen every lie that you tell you chose you made a decision to lie you decided to lie about something to steal you made a choice a decision to steal something to backbite you made a choice so in life we have many choices to make what has been your choice as you lived have you chosen a life of holiness righteousness godliness sanctification a life of pleasure until i get too old to party and then i get right see that's a choice and god give you a right to make that choice god give you the right to choose to serve him or not you don't have to god will not force us to serve him god will not force you to fast to pray he will not force you to get baptized in jesus name he will not force you to yield your life to him to receive the gift of the holy ghost it's your choice your decision and i've learned through my years in the ministry and before being a minister before being a preacher i was taught and learned a long time ago you make your own choices and decisions the devil cannot make you he can tempt you but he cannot make you amen he can entice you he cannot force you to do wrong amen when a person goes uh through life amen choices have to be made and jesus christ set before us he said i give you a choice i'll sit before you life and death now you choose which one you want amen what has been your choice am i what has been your choice to serve him to give your life to him or to wait a little longer and come back another time am i make my choice a decision you know i don't have time for all that church stuff amen they want me to come to church three or four times a week you know you know i got to get up early in the morning and go to work and the very same night death comes don't get a chance to go back to that good job the next day but how did you spend the day before what decisions you make before that time brothers and sisters today is a day of making decisions to follow christ and stay with him and and i feel something here there are some of you i don't know who but you in between trying to decide decide to stay in the church or to leave and god has never led me wrong you're someone someone's you're in the valley of decision trying to decide whether i want to stay in church i'll do something else i won't do i want to stay in the church where i am a member i want to go looking for someplace else to go and all the time the hand clock is turning and death is still on its way amen make the right decision make the right choice uh i don't apologize for deviating from the end i choose rather to follow the spirit of god when god speaks to me and i know for sure as i stand here before you today someone is in the valley of indecision have not made that decision that we should make and that's a walk with christ until the end back to the closing of this message on this afternoon amen sometimes amen we live a life amen and when we get saved and you know how happy you was when you first got saved and you were sincere and you know god led you to the truth and then somebody witnessed to you someone brought you to the church and you heard the gospel preached you heard about water baptism in the name of jesus christ being the only baptism that saves you heard about the gift of the holy ghost that god promised to fill every believer with where you'll speak in tongues and be filled with the holy ghost it may have the power of god living in you to live a righteous and godly life amen you made that choice in that decision you went to the water you got baptized in water in the name of jesus christ filled with the gift for the holy ghost amen and he was on fire for the lord amen but saving is always there he's watching and waiting an opportunity amen he's trying to decide amen where he can trip you up so that leaving back to my message subject where would you spend eternity on one hand christ has offered you eternal life on the other hand satan is scheming and do all that he can to cause you to turn away from that salvation that god had given to you and to turn back to a life of sin because as you go on in life if you live to be 95 or 105 death will eventually come and when death comes you need to be ready there's only one way to be ready be with god walking with him staying with him amen the question is where would you spend eternity if the day was your last day where would you spend eternity if you died today where would you spend eternity and you know each one of us know if we be honest with ourselves you know at this very moment if you die today you know whether or not you go to hell or to heaven amen we know right now whether or not you're ready for the rapture or not why procrastinate set your house in order because after the death you cannot make any changes live that life while you live give your life to christ and leave it with him so when the rapture come no matter when it comes or when death comes no matter how it comes and when it comes you'll be ready to go back with the lord amen don't live 60 70 80 years of age amen and die and go to hell don't live 15 years or 20 years and die and miss the rapture god give us an opportunity to choose he said i set before you life and death you choose which way you want to go salvation is free to you but it cost him his life he died on the cross shared his blood that we all might be saved in mind and many of you that's here today even as young people young children came to the lord jesus christ were baptized in his name and filled with the holy ghost amen and that's a wonderful thing you have more time to give to the lord as we go on no matter what life brings amen he's there with us salvation give to us that hope of eternal life if we stay with god don't stray before him but the you that's here today wherever you attend church remember this one thing the choice is yours to live or to die to live righteously and die out to sin live an ungodly life and spend eternity in the lake of fine brimstone which is the second death god gives us hope it goes beyond the grave and eternity is a long time amen and when you get to heaven am i what a time of rejoicing that's going to be amen you're talking about a reunion amen you're talking about a good time amen when you walk the streets of gold when you can sing a song amen that the angels can't sing amen i've been redeemed amen as you stand aside and you hear the angelic wild all the angels singing their songs of praises amen and then your time come to sing and you sing your song i've been redeemed and the angels can't help you saying that amen they never been redeemed amen it was created angels created serving worship in god but some made a choice a decision to leave that place with god and fight with satan and his angels to take god off of the throne and replace him with satan as the god of heaven and on earth but thank god for righteousness gabriel and all of his angels prevailed and the devil was cast out of heaven and the bible says this as he fell down to the earth amen the book of revelation said amen i saw amen satan falling as a star amen and they say woe unto the habit of the earth and of the sea satan has come down to you having great wrath and sailing is on a rampage and he did not rest day no night and he had a lot of help with helping him amen because his time is short and he's trying to do all he can to deceive to steal and destroy your eternal life he's trying to keep sinners in bondage amen to sin i have an opportunity to be saved but god has set you free thank god for your salvation thank god for being filled with the gift of the holy ghost and walk with god continue to walk with him amen no matter what comes in life amen god will take you through the pain family that you feel now amen it will soon go away god will replace it and then with the wonderful memories of daniel y'all replace that with the spirit of joy and happiness amen you're hurting now but it won't last forever god will bring you peace and comfort amen as you walk with him amen god will console you in the days and the years to come and make your calling election story stay with god walk with him and god promised i will never leave you and i will never forsake you you can walk away from god you can save him but long as god live he will always be with you even when you turn in the sin the holy ghost in you amen just five more minutes you know people don't understand when the holy ghost feels in you he stays there to one or two things the rapture of death amen is there and you walk away from god and i'm talking to somebody here today you walk away from the lord turn back to a life of sinfulness and the holy ghost in you amen every day telling you you know don't do that you know that's not right you know put that down don't do that don't go here don't say that and we override that and but pretty soon the holy ghost started getting quiet because if i it's no use you won't listen and when you go into eternity and mine the holy ghost leaves and he goes back with the lord and that's the only time after you receive the holy ghost it's going to leave is either at the rapture or at death amen no matter how you may have lived he's there pleading with you we'll see you with that hope in us and god in us amen who loved you so much that he died for your sins amen and the holy ghost are there to remind us to lead and direct us but listen never ignore the spirit of god working in you amen let god have his way and not your way god bless you simon family we thank god for it we're praying for you amen we stand always prepared to do whatever we can to assist you in any way that we can and we thank god for you amen thank god for daniel amen he's going to be missed he won't be replaced amen but
