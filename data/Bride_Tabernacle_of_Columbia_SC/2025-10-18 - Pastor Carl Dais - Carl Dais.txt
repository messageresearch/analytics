Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your grace and mercy tonight. We thank you for the power of your spirit. We thank you for our lives that we live before you. And Lord, as we at this junction of time, we need your grace tonight. We need your mercy tonight. We need your love tonight. As we minister to your bride tonight, the purchase of your blood tonight. We thank you tonight for all things. Lord, we thank you tonight for Pastor Simmons and the saints of God tonight. [Music] What a people of God that we stand before. Lord, we ask you to move by your spirit tonight. We ask you to save souls, to fill with your spirit, to do what you want to do tonight. It'll be pleasing to us, Lord. For we thank you and commit all things into your hands. For we love you now in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we stand tonight, the book of 1 Corinthians 9th chapter. Amen. Amen. and 13th verse. &gt;&gt; You have it say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Do ye not Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? And they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar. Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live the gospel, live of the gospel. But I have used none of these things, neither have I written these things that it should be so done unto me. For it were better for me to die than any man should make my glorying void. For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of. For necessity is laid upon me, yay, woe unto me if I preach not the gospel. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward. But if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me, what is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. Amen. for a few seconds, a few minutes. I just want to say a few things before I go into the minister the word. Tonight is me and my wife 33rd anniversary. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] We met on this night 33 years ago. Amen. But I 30th anniversary was August 5th. Amen. 33 years ago. I looked back and I said, "Honey, got a little gray." Amen. And I also, you know, want to thank the Simmons family and them for accepting me into the family. Amen. With open arms. And I also want to say, Pastor Simmons, I appreciate you. a big brother, a father, a uncle in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. From the depths of my heart. Amen. It's He's inspired me. And a lot of things that I do in Camden is come from his upbringing. He inspired me. I just had to learn how to be a little easier. And generations are changing now. So, you got to be a little easier and work with people. But I just thank God for his grace down in Camden. And every time I see the church growing or doing something, I think about Pastor Simmons and his rearing up as Paul said uh to Timothy, my son in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And I look as a father in the gospel. Amen. God bless you. As Paul said, sometimes I need these things here. Do ye not know that they which minister of holy things live of the things of the temple? And they which wait at the altar are partakers of the altar. Our thought tonight, the cross of Calvary. We've been working on that series for a little while, the cross of Calvary. But when we look at the cross, we look at something's crucified. When we look at the cross, we look at a life that's crucified. We look at something that is centered on crucifixion. And crucifixion represents death. Death to self. And I said, Lord, as my journey in the ministry, I said, Lord, the more things I go through, I look at dying out. and you think you're dead and then God just sends something else to kill you even more. &gt;&gt; And as you die, it generates such a love for your enemies. It generates such a power that I said, Lord, we're tapping into something that when love abides for your enemy, for people that may dislike you. When you begin to tap into that ministry of love, suffering has to take you there. As the prophet said to one of the brothers, the Lord has to put you up here. I can't take you up here. The Lord put me up here. So in our Christian journey as a crucified Christian, the Lord has to take us from glory to glory by his spirit. And we look at Paul ministry as Paul was ministering. Paul began to tell him in Corinthians, I'm a Hebrew of a Hebrew. I'm of the stock of Benjamin, the tri stock of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin. I was circumcised the eighth day. He could tell people that he sat under the feet of Gion. But when he got to the end of his ministry, when he went into the prison, he write a letter back to Filimon and he said, "I got Onimus converted in here and I'm sending him back to you with a letter of love." Paul had not only began to be an apostle, but he said, "Now I'm a prisoner of the Lord." &gt;&gt; So when you're a prisoner tonight of the Lord, nothing that somebody say or do to you bothers you. And God begin to take you down that road that you know that all things are possible to them that believe. Why? Because the cross of Calvary tonight is still permeating in our heart. And we see the blood every time we go through our sacrifices and our trials, we see that blood has been reinvented in our heart. That what he done at Calvary still lives in our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 1 and 18, he said, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." &gt;&gt; See, the preaching of the cross is the power of God to you and I. that cross tonight. The Bible says in Isaiah 53, "Who have believed our report and to whom the arm of the Lord has been revealed?" &gt;&gt; See that cross tonight, it keeps us to a place that when you think you are somebody, when you look back at what God has done for you, you recognize it was only grace. &gt;&gt; You recognize that it was only the mercy of God that you are where you are at. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "For the preaching of the cross is of them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved. It is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the strive? Where's the disputer of this world? Have not God made the foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God? For it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; By the foolishness of preaching to save you and I. &gt;&gt; The foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; For the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after the wisdom. But we preach Christ what? Crucified. &gt;&gt; We preach him crucified. Because when the crucified savior is in your life, it takes you to a place of dying out that you know is not your ability no more, but it's the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Corinthians, I didn't come to you with excellency or speech or men with, but I come demonstrating the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; He could come with knowledge. &gt;&gt; He could come with a lot of stuff. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I didn't come to you like that." Let's go to Corinthians 2. Just one page over two and one. And I, brethren, when I came to you, I came not with excellency or speech or of wisdom, declare unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him what? &gt;&gt; Crucified. &gt;&gt; See, Paul wanted to see the crucified savior in their life. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to know how smart they was or what was going on in the church. He wanted to know, was you part of that crucified? &gt;&gt; And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and what? &gt;&gt; Power. That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of a man, but in the power of what? How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this world, nor the princes of this world that come to know, but we speak wisdom of God in a what? Mystery. And see that mystery, you can't see that mystery until the Christ has been crucified and the rigger mortar has set in. That's when you can see the mystery. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, I got a mystery. I know this and know that." No, the mystery of Christ is that you die. And when you died, God began to dispatch his love to you. That's why they could spit on him at the cross. He said, "If you be the son of God, come down from the cross and save us and save yourself." He had love on his mind. &gt;&gt; He had continual love on his heart for you and I. They stabbed him, they whipped him, they spit on him, but he had love. That's why Paul when he got that love, he could be whipped and beat and left for dead outside of the city and get up and run to the next city telling somebody about the goodness of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But we speak wisdom of God in the mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory. &gt;&gt; See, the princes don't know what's going on now. &gt;&gt; Then I told the guy, I said, "You know what? Everybody's fighting about the United States. Who can stay here?" I said, "But y'all can have this place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hand up with a bunch of robbers and liars and adulterers and fornicators and killers. Y'all can have this place. You trying to run everybody back to their own country. I said, "We going to a country that flowed with milk. We going to a country that don't have no water no more. The Bible says in Revelation, it won't be no more sea and it won't be no more sun or moon because he'll be the light of the city. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and run all you want to run out of this city. I'mma will willfully leave. &gt;&gt; I'mma willfully leave. &gt;&gt; I'mma willfully leave. Why? Cuz no man can break in and rob us can steal &gt;&gt; where we going. &gt;&gt; But still yet, who who want to say who who's supposed to be here anyway? Only God knows who's supposed to be here. The ones that were predestinated to eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's the ones that were supposed to be here. &gt;&gt; Now look what he says. The wisdom of God in the mystery, none of the prince, but as it is written, I have not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God have prepared for them that what? &gt;&gt; Now we going back to love. So not a crucified savior, what Calvary done for you and I, that love draws us into complete fellowship and submission as a prisoner. &gt;&gt; That's amen. &gt;&gt; See, Paul went from one degree to a next, but Paul ended up, he said, I am a prisoner of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're a prisoner, that mean you're handcuffed, &gt;&gt; hand and feet, maybe sh back, but when you're a prisoner, They tell you when to get up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you can go to bed. When you can eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Paul was such a prisoner of the Lord that he was so bit on what God wanted to do. In the book of Acts, he was praying and the Lord said, "Show him a vision. I got some people over here. &gt;&gt; Go over here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was all about his will and not building himself his own kingdom. It was about the kingdom of God. And see, when the genuine love is there, it's not about who, but it's about the grace of God. &gt;&gt; What God wants done with his word. &gt;&gt; And the bride, because she loved Jesus, she know what he wants done with the word. Why? Cuz she has been anointed by his spirit and the spirit revealth all things. Yeah. The deep things of God. &gt;&gt; So the deep things is coming to you by mystery. And now you know that how to please him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God had revealed him to us by his spirit. For the spirit searches all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him. Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the word, but the spirit of God, which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. See, you got to get in that place where you know what's freely yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We got to stop playing church. &gt;&gt; We got to get get along and get with God. &gt;&gt; We got to know what God wants to do. &gt;&gt; God said, "Your faith can't go no further, son, until you get with me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your faith, the Bible says in Hebrews 11, now faith, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; present tense. How? Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things what? &gt;&gt; Not seen. So now your faith is bringing things that are not seen in the visible tangibleness. It's bringing things into tangibleness. It's bringing things into your vision that wouldn't be seen that are seen now by you. The Bible said Abraham what saw things that was He knew that God was going to supply a lamb. &gt;&gt; Come on now. He knew that God was go going to give him a ram or something in the bush. He went to stab his son and it was a ram caught in the thicket. He knew his faith said if I kill him, God going to raise him up. &gt;&gt; See, he had faith to believe what God has ordained for him to do. Why? But because of his blood, it wasn't Abraham blood, but it was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if that blood could work like that before the cross, what could it do the night after the cross &gt;&gt; in your life and mine? It could produce such love that'll generate the power of God. Uh you could you don't even have to get the tongues of prophecy. The love of God will cast out devils. Uh will heal the sick. Uh will save the lost. We'll restore the backslide. Uh will fill with the Holy Ghost. That's what love will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love castes out all fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Acts 2 &gt;&gt; and 23. The cross, the blood of Jesus. Acts 2 and 23. And it says, I start at the 22nd verse. Ye men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, man approved of God by you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you. as ye yourselves also know him being the delivered by the determinate counsel and fornowledge of God. And ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God has raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be hold of it. For David speaketh concerning him, I forsaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be what? move. &gt;&gt; So if God is with you, you can't be moved tonight. &gt;&gt; If God is with you, you can't be moved tonight. Therefore, did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh did rest in hope because thou would not leave thy soul in hell. Neither would I suffer. Thy holy one to see corruption. See, they were talking to Paul in the New Testament in Corinthians. They said, "Is the cross?" Did somebody really die? Cross. Paul said if if he not been crucified then our faith is vain. But because he was crucified to the believers uh he's a resurrected inside of you uh he's living tonight inside of you because of the blood of Jesus. Uh and because of that blood tonight you can walk in newness of life. Uh you can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Uh and you can be filled with his precious Holy Spirit. Uh and because of that life and because of that blood uh you can walk uh and you can tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus uh and the anointing would follow you uh to confirm his word. Uh the Bible said strong is he that executute his word. Uh he can execute his word in your life tonight. Uh that love might continue to abide. If you got any false or hated spirit, uh, or you need to make up with someone, uh, just look at what the cross done for you and I. There were two men standing at the cross, sitting on the cross with Jesus. Uh, and one said, "If you be the son of God, I'm wondering tonight whether you on the left or you on the right." Uh, there are two on the cross and the ones on the right. He said, "We're justly due for the reward that we have done." Uh we come to pay our debt for what we have done. Uh but the one on the left uh he said if you be the son of God uh oh God take us down from the cross and yourself uh and the one on the right said Lord uh when you get in your kingdom uh remember me uh when you get to your kingdom uh and Jesus turned to him and said uh the day you'll be with me in paradise uh and Peter said a day is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day and The Lord is not slack concerning his promises. You can bet on it tonight that he's not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness, but is long suffering to usward who will believe. Uh but Peter said, uh this second epistle I now write unto you uh in which I stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance. I come tonight to stir up your minds uh that the cross of Calvary is in plain view. Uh he's ushering you into the kingdom uh the kingdom of God. Uh cuz the Bible says in Ephesians uh it went to adoption to the redemption of our bodies. Uh you looking for an adoption tonight? You got to go on to the adoption uh where you can be placed in the body of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:13 said, "By one spirit, Holy Spirit, we are baptized into one body, and that's the body of Christ." &gt;&gt; If you're not baptized into that body tonight, that's the mythical body of Christ. It's not a church organization. It is the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the power of Christ. And if you're baptized into that body, you got the same power that Jesus had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans says, "If the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, &gt;&gt; if it dwell in you, &gt;&gt; he that raised up Christ shall also quicken your mortal bodies." &gt;&gt; I feel a quickening tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the Holy Ghost is real tonight. &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection is real tonight. God will show me something the day before and I get to work and it'll play out like a picture before me. I said, "Lord, look at here." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm just coming to let you know, son, &gt;&gt; that I'm with you. I'm showing you what's taking place tomorrow &gt;&gt; on your job." &gt;&gt; And people are part, they are actors in this &gt;&gt; picture. Jesus, the mighty God, &gt;&gt; met Moses in the burning bush. &gt;&gt; He said, "Take off your shoes, Moses, where you stand in his holy ground. Genesis 3 said the head the head of the the feet shall bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent shall bruise his heel. That was the prophecy of Jesus Christ dying at Calvary. The woman's seed. We know the woman don't have a seed but it was the woman's seed which was Christ. When he come forth he said the veil of the temple is raining twain from top to bottom. &gt;&gt; What's the veil now? don't have to be no priest to go before God, &gt;&gt; but you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't have to be to preach no more. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Revelations, he made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can go to God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You cry out until a broken and a contrite spirit come. Until God come, you stay there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the power come, you stay there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every time you need to revive, stay there till the power come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I didn't come to you with excellence. I come in power." Amen. &gt;&gt; I come in demonstration. &gt;&gt; You know, I talked to some religious people. I said, "I need a God that I can feel." &gt;&gt; They said, "Man, I just preaching. I'm just preaching." Uhuh. I said, "I need a God to do something." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ask your wife to do something and she do it. She She's performing what you asking. Right. &gt;&gt; And we the wife of Jesus, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ask him something, he's performing to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need a God. You just don't just preach &gt;&gt; year in and year out. You got to see the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to see the anointing in your life. &gt;&gt; God has to medicate it. &gt;&gt; God, I'm going through something. Everything you take me to do something, but I got to see the power every now and then. &gt;&gt; I got to see something taking place. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Other than that, you don't know what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; I was at the IG restaurant in Camden. 7day Adventist guy. Me and him get to talking. &gt;&gt; And I he talked for a little while. Let him talk a good while. Then I started talking since he was so smart. I said, "What happened under the sixth seal?" He ain't even know. I said, "Now, all right. Now, don't act like you know everything." Now, tell me what happened under the sixth seal. Under the fifth seal, it wasn't no beast. You had the white, black, red, and pale. &gt;&gt; Fifth seal, they said was no beast. Under the sixth seal said, "What happened to the sixth seal?" He didn't know. So, that's when the anointing hit me. I started preaching and jumping and everything. White lady come out. I did. She thought I was fighting that guy. That guy after we finished me and him hug one another. He said, "Preacher, I don't know what's going on with you." I said, "But you something hit you and you." He said, "I got to come see you." He probably 7th Day Advent. I told him all your religion. I said, "Tease Russell 7th Day Adventist." I said, "I studied your religion. &gt;&gt; Knew everything about his religion. No, T. Russ is your witness. &gt;&gt; But I said, Lord, I thank you for your grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thank you for your mercy. &gt;&gt; And I thank you for your love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you feel the anointing and the presence of God come upon your life, God come to help you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He come to strengthen you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He come to anoint you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your darkest hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when God comes to reinforce your presence, his presence in your life. &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, the cross, things may happen to you or transpire in your life. That's when the cross comes to reinforce who you are. He comes to reinforce what he has done for you and what he's doing for you right now. Matthew 27. Matthew 27 and 28. And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head and a reed in his what? &gt;&gt; Right hand. &gt;&gt; And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the what?" &gt;&gt; And they spit upon him and took the reed and smokeote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him and put on his own raignment on him and led him away to what? Crucify him. And as they came out, they found a man ofSirene by name him they compared to bear what? &gt;&gt; His cross. And when they had come to a place called Golgatha, that is to say a place of his skull, they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with Gaul. And when they had tasted there, he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him and parted what? &gt;&gt; And casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they did what? Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And sitting down, they watched him there and set over his head. This accusation written, "This is Jesus, the king of the what?" &gt;&gt; And they were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, saying, Thou that destroyth this temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself, if thou be the son of God, come down from the cross. &gt;&gt; Likewise, the chief also priests, mocking him with the scribes and elders, saying, he saved others himself he cannot save. &gt;&gt; If he be the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and we will what? Amen. &gt;&gt; He trusted in God. Let him deliver him now if he will have him. For he said he was the son of God. Now the 23rd chapter of Luke, you can go where the two malifactors. They said what they had to say. 23 and 42 of Luke. They said what they had to say. One wanted to be saved and the other wanted to question Jesus authority. But I'm wondering tonight by his grace, what do you think about this cross of Calvary, this present time of your ministry? What do you think about the cross? Has the sufferings of your life draw you closer to Christ? Or the things that you've been through draw you closer to Christ? the trials, the suffering, the tests, the things that you've went through in your family, in your body. Has it drawn you closer to Christ? The objective and the motive is to get you in love with Jesus to a point that you become a prisoner of the cross. &gt;&gt; You become a prisoner of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you no longer want this world and the things of this world, but you want to be centered on Christ and his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because one day we're going to have to leave this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, people think this is a place that you can stay. &gt;&gt; People think it's a place that you can stay. &gt;&gt; This is not a place to stay. This is a place that we got we passing through. &gt;&gt; And whatever I can do for Christ in this body, &gt;&gt; let me do it. Lord, give me the grace and mercy to execute and carry out what you've ordained for my life. &gt;&gt; That should be every Christian's all glory. That should be every Christian tonight. Lord, what can I do for this Jesus that's called Christ? He's on your hand tonight. &gt;&gt; What can I do for Jesus Christ tonight? &gt;&gt; Give me the strength, Lord, and the wisdom and the knowledge and the submission that I can carry out the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God 56 years old said, "What? I haven't done nothing for the Lord yet." I said, "Lord have mercy." If he could say that at 56, what can we say now? Jesus at 33, &gt;&gt; he cast out devils. He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He opened not blind eyes. He preached the acceptable year unto the Lord to the people that wouldn't that would reject him. He blinded his own children eyes in Romans 10:11 that you and I might have a right to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. what he thought about us Gentiles. &gt;&gt; The bride, the lamb's wife. He thought about you and I in such a way that he chose us as his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight if a wife will say, "I'm not getting this for you. I'm not doing that for you." Get it yourself. &gt;&gt; What kind of wife is that? I'm not praying tonight. I'm not studying today. I'm not reading the Bible today. I'm not doing nothing today. What do we do Jesus like that? What would we do to Jesus? I just want to sit down and watch some television. I just want to play on my phone on my iPad tonight. Play checkers of this little game they be having on the phone. Blocks and stuff going together. Well, what kind of joy you get? How blocks going together and falling apart and exploding and going on getting 20 30,000 points almost like jeopardy. The devil want to do anything to steal your time &gt;&gt; away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; He have you watching all kind of stuff. Fred Sanford, Good Times, Family Feud, CNN. All they doing on CNN is replaying what is already happened. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The president and all of them. It's only a repeat of what already is happening. &gt;&gt; We know the King of the North has the Bombs with America name on it. We know that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he's supposed to do. He's ordained to do and everybody is in radicalness. He's doing exactly what God has ordained him to do. And you doing exactly what God ordained you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We doing exactly what God ordained us to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We praying and getting closer to God cuz eternal life is is there. &gt;&gt; I give unto you eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I give unto you eternal life. I told my daughter, she said, "Dad, I stayed all up all last night, the night before. I got a A on this and I got a A on that." And I said, "Baby girl, you're doing a good job." Because anything that's worth getting, you got to fight for it. &gt;&gt; That's why ain't many people getting it. You got to fight for it. You got to stay up for it. You got to get it. And if you want the Holy Ghost, you got to fight for it. &gt;&gt; Fight your flesh to die out that Jesus might be glorified. Amen. True. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus said the token which is the Holy Spirit which the father will send in my name. He's going to give you that token. That token is easy to get. But you got to surrender. You won't have to look like the world. You don't have to act like the world. You don't have to follow the things of the world. The token will take you there. But as long as you got some speck of the world wanting to be what? Like the world. The Holy Ghost ain't coming. The Holy Ghost want to completely deaf. God bless you tonight. I know we got baptism. Amen. I don't want to be too long. One last scripture and I'm closing. 2 Corinthians 5 and 14. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "For the love of Christ constrainth us, &gt;&gt; because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we are all what?" &gt;&gt; And that he died for all, that they which live should not live henceforth unto themselves, but unto him which died for what? &gt;&gt; And rose what? &gt;&gt; Again. &gt;&gt; Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh. Yay, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we henceforth him no &gt;&gt; more &gt;&gt; more. Therefore, if any man be in what? &gt;&gt; Christ, &gt;&gt; he is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things become new. And all things are of God, who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. &gt;&gt; To which that God was in Christ, reconciled the word to himself, not imputing your trespasses unto them, and have committed unto us the word of what? &gt;&gt; Reconciliation. &gt;&gt; Now, reconciliation.
