[36:19] Living Waters
[36:21] amen Jeremiah 2
[36:25] And1 if you got it say amen and it reads
[36:30] have not a nation changed their gods
[36:33] which are yet no Gods but my people have
[36:35] changed their glory for that which does
[36:38] not profit be astonished all ye Heavens

[36:51] Waters and have heed themselves heed
[36:55] hewed out heue them out sisters broken
[36:59] sisters that cannot that can hold no
[37:01] water is Israel a servant is he a
[37:04] homeborn slave why is he spoiled the
[37:08] Young Lions roared upon him and yelled
[37:10] and they have made his land waste his
[37:12] cities are burned without inhabitant may
[37:15] God have bless to reading of his word
[37:17] may be seated tonight by the grace of
[37:20] God just for a moment amen we said we
[37:22] want to talk about Living Waters amen
[37:25] you know uh sitting here and you know
[37:28] there something that was on my heart and
[37:31] and I was thinking about you know I was
[37:32] just going over and reading over the
[37:34] book of Jeremiah here lately and you
[37:36] know and and and the things that you
[37:38] know he was prophesying and mostly you
[37:41] know what he was trying there at the
[37:43] beginning was to call the people to a
[37:45] back to a repentance State you know to
[37:48] repentance to let the you let them know
[37:51] you know y'all you have gone astray and
[37:53] God is calling you back and if you don't
[37:56] come back God is going to punish you you
[37:58] know but the people weren't listening at
[38:01] that time were they and the thing is the
[38:04] reason why they weren't listening is
[38:05] because a lot of times you know they had
[38:08] too many other voices in the land of
[38:10] that day same as uh you know we deal
[38:13] with today was Jeremiah was crying out
[38:15] you know and the Lord put the word in
[38:18] Jeremiah's mouth and he was crying out
[38:21] to the people to come back to God or or
[38:23] the Babylonians was going to come and
[38:25] burn this city with fire
[38:27] and yet you had other prophets at that
[38:28] time too false prophets crying out to
[38:31] the people telling the people that
[38:33] everything is all right you all right
[38:35] you all right God is going to come
[38:36] Deliver Us One the place they said Egypt
[38:39] going to come and then but Jeremiah was
[38:41] telling them Egypt ain't going to come
[38:42] they going to go right back where they
[38:43] came from and say I'm telling you you
[38:46] know to repent if you turn from your
[38:48] ways God will God will restore you God
[38:51] will visit you but if you don't you're
[38:53] going into captivity but he had a lot of
[38:56] things thinking he had a lot to contend
[38:57] with in those days you know a lot of was
[39:00] so many other voices and what it was all
[39:03] the other voices you know as Jeremiah
[39:06] was calling the people to repentance all
[39:09] the other voices were telling the people
[39:10] you all right everything all right every
[39:12] all is well you know and I says you know
[39:15] a lot of times ain't that what you know
[39:16] we deal with in the hour that we live in
[39:19] as the Bible declared that you know
[39:21] Darkness was going to cover the Earth
[39:22] and gross Darkness to people right and
[39:25] you try to say 10 tell the people today
[39:27] that the world is is not getting any
[39:30] better it's only getting in worse going
[39:31] in Gross Darkness so we we find
[39:33] ourselves a lot of times you know uh
[39:36] like Paul says dying daily searching
[39:38] your own self out your own soul
[39:40] salvation with fear and tremble
[39:41] searching yourself out calling you
[39:43] always find yourself in a repentant
[39:45] State saying Lord I want to search my I
[39:48] want you to search my heart try my reign
[39:50] I don't want to feel like you know oh
[39:51] I'm all right I'm all right cuz what
[39:54] that's that's the the makeover of the
[39:56] Mind that the devil want to put on the
[39:57] people that likey Daisy everything is
[40:00] all right everything is all right and
[40:02] nobody really come into a repent of
[40:03] State because there's so many other
[40:05] voices saying yay yay yay but yet the
[40:08] voice of God is crying out no y'all
[40:10] believe that tonight so I says that
[40:13] Jeremiah had a lot to contend with but
[40:15] no matter how many other other voices
[40:18] there were in that day coming against
[40:20] what Jeremiah was saying Jeremiah had
[40:23] what the word of the Lord was and you
[40:25] know I believe he said one place I'm
[40:26] going to make your word like fire and
[40:29] the people like wood right but I says
[40:32] what it is you know it just just Liv
[40:35] looking here at how you know uh uh uh
[40:38] Jeremiah was saying here and prophesying
[40:41] he was saying you know the the people
[40:43] have committed two evils against me he
[40:46] says they have tra they have uh uh
[40:48] forsaken me you know and that's the
[40:51] thing God in this journey he said I'll
[40:54] never leave you nor forsake you
[40:57] but the people have forsaken him and
[41:00] they turn and they say a lot of times
[41:02] where is God or they or they'll you know
[41:05] just going in their ways but God said
[41:07] he'll never forsake you and that's what
[41:09] it is he says they have committed two
[41:11] evils and they have forsaken me and he
[41:15] called himself the Fountain of Living
[41:17] Waters come on you know as we always
[41:21] been saying here the last couple of
[41:23] weeks if if you would only know what God
[41:25] want to do for your life
[41:26] if you would only know the depths that
[41:28] God want to take you to but a lot of
[41:30] times you know the the people they don't
[41:33] they don't stay long enough to see The
[41:34] Depths because what happens God you can
[41:37] be in a you can be in a bad state or
[41:39] whatever in a bad condition and just
[41:42] like Israel was down in Egypt but they
[41:45] sighed and cried by the reason of
[41:46] bondage didn't they but then all then
[41:48] God and he sends a prophet down to
[41:50] deliver them oh they rejoicing shouting
[41:53] and rejoicing as a prophet came down to
[41:55] bring them out but it wasn't long after
[41:57] they got from under their task Masters
[41:59] after God had delivered them it wasn't
[42:01] long before now they don't want hey we
[42:04] what happened to this man Moses we'll
[42:06] make this golden calf wasn't long before
[42:08] they they they uh div it away from from
[42:12] that cry that stir that they once had
[42:14] they wanted God to do something in their
[42:16] life wasn't long before they got away
[42:18] from that cry why because they the
[42:20] Taskmaster things look like it l up
[42:22] right been a little easy in their life
[42:25] so it wasn't long before get away from
[42:27] that and they already ready to forsake
[42:28] the one that brought them out y'all
[42:30] believe that tonight but I says what is
[42:33] it what it is we always we always want
[42:36] to stay in in Revival mode in your
[42:39] spirit you always want to stay within
[42:41] yourself or or refreshing that's what
[42:44] that's I you know we sing that song
[42:46] sometime Lord take me back to where I
[42:48] first believe because you want to stay
[42:51] in that refreshing mode I don't know
[42:53] about you but always to that place you
[42:55] always want to see God like that like we
[42:58] singing a little song Lord do something
[43:00] new you always want to see God do
[43:02] something new in your life you always
[43:04] want to see God move again in your life
[43:07] and then when you feel you know
[43:09] sometimes that you're a little stalemate
[43:11] or or things look like they creeping in
[43:12] you get somewhere in isolation with God
[43:15] and you say Lord people might say oh you
[43:17] all right God is blessing you move but
[43:19] within yourself you feel like you need
[43:21] something something more from God no
[43:24] matter how much men are telling you
[43:25] everything is all right you within your
[43:27] in your in your spirit and your inner
[43:29] man you longing saying God I need more
[43:32] of you come on it's not that man can
[43:35] tell you you all right every day but
[43:37] what is the inner man telling you come
[43:40] on all these voices can say everything
[43:43] is all right but what is the inner man
[43:45] what is the teacher what is he telling
[43:47] you what is that is that thirst do you
[43:49] still have that emptiness that that
[43:51] something you know that you need to be
[43:53] quenched and don't and sometimes we'll
[43:56] ride it on out ride it on out but I says
[43:58] you know God God he's the Fountain of
[44:01] Living Waters y'all believe that tonight
[44:04] I was preaching last week I said I know
[44:05] a little bit about running water now
[44:07] brother Gerald since happened last week
[44:10] but I says what it is he's that Fountain
[44:13] ain't he come on he's that Fountain of
[44:17] Living
[44:18] Waters I I know I know one thing you
[44:20] know one thing about God he he never
[44:23] ever it's never been a trial that God
[44:26] wasen able to right to handle I was
[44:29] laying in the bed today I said you know
[44:31] it's nothing that God God is the
[44:33] champion of
[44:34] everything things come up and what it is
[44:37] he's a Fountain of Living Water he's a
[44:39] well that'll never run dry come on he
[44:42] says you come to drink of the draw of
[44:44] this well he says and you going to
[44:45] thirst again but the water I give you he
[44:48] said it'll be like a whale springing up
[44:50] in you I've experienced that Christ is
[44:52] that well that never runs dry come on
[44:56] it's not that you come to God and like
[44:58] some people say I say oh he coming back
[45:01] again what you need now come on but God
[45:03] said I'll Supply your needs according to
[45:06] his riches and Glory come on he's that
[45:09] well he's that Fountain of Living Water
[45:12] that well that'll never run dry anything
[45:14] you need all you have need of and all he
[45:18] is the place where you can go and draw
[45:20] from and it never you can't stop I was
[45:23] thinking that you can't stop God
[45:26] you can't you can't beat god- giving you
[45:29] can't beat God blessing you can't stop
[45:31] him you can't tell him what to do or
[45:33] what not to do right but the thing about
[45:36] it is one thing about God he's going to
[45:38] keep his word no matter what because he
[45:41] is the word he can't change he can't he
[45:43] says God is not a man I'm not a man he's
[45:45] he's not going to lie to you right so
[45:49] what it is when when you have needs need
[45:52] of healing I like how here in Jeremiah
[45:55] he was saying I'm going to bring the
[45:56] health and the Cure come on I'm going to
[45:59] heal you and I'm going to bring the cure
[46:00] to all your diseases come on but I want
[46:02] you to turn to me You' forsaken me the
[46:05] Fountain of Living Waters haven't God
[46:08] blessed you haven't God brought you
[46:10] haven't God delivered you haven't God
[46:12] provided all your needs having God made
[46:14] a way come on but when things seem to be
[46:17] good we forsake Him sometime don't we
[46:19] and he says they Hune out themselves
[46:21] sists he says and broken sists now we
[46:24] know what a sister is it's a handmade
[46:26] ain't it like a tank or something that
[46:28] you know they put water in you know I
[46:30] was thinking
[46:31] about back in the in the in the days my
[46:35] dad was telling us cuz we raised in a
[46:37] house with a tin roof on it and I was
[46:39] thinking about uh back in the days and
[46:41] my dad was telling us about some of the
[46:43] people would knock the the water out the
[46:45] house in the buckets and stuff ball it
[46:47] drank it you know whatever but I was
[46:49] just thinking about you know when you
[46:51] comparing how sometimes people had used
[46:54] to have to strap for water scrap for
[46:56] this but yet God is the Fountain of
[46:58] Living Waters he's that he's that well
[47:01] like we say that River that's going to
[47:03] keep on running you can't stop it you
[47:05] can try to Dam it up and all that that
[47:07] but it's going to find a way to flow
[47:08] over to burst to get in every crack
[47:10] every crevice anywhere where it can find
[47:13] its way in that water is going to run in
[47:16] you can't stop it so I says the what it
[47:18] is you compare when you compare the two
[47:21] right the living water versus the the
[47:24] broken sister or the stagnated water
[47:27] when you compare the two there is no
[47:30] comparison sometimes you think why
[47:33] people in their minds when you compare
[47:35] what
[47:36] godh has to offer versus what the what
[47:39] the enemy has to offer there's no
[47:41] comparison is it but the minds of people
[47:45] I says what it is the Devil Makes what
[47:47] he has must be so appealing right that
[47:51] is way more appealing to the world than
[47:53] what God has to offer you but you know
[47:55] you know a lot of times like it says U
[47:57] when we beheld him there's no beauty
[47:59] that we shall desire him right there no
[48:02] Beauty and God didn't look like much of
[48:04] nothing did it come on he didn't look
[48:08] like much of
[48:09] nothing but he was a king of kings and
[48:11] the Lord of lords wasn't he he was
[48:13] standing there you know uh uh and they
[48:16] was uh uh before pilot that day maybe
[48:20] and had to read on his head blood coming
[48:22] down hair on his face beat all night
[48:25] look like look like much of nothing did
[48:27] he but then you can go into King's
[48:29] palaces you can see Kai and all those
[48:31] look like they were great men and
[48:33] somebody but Jesus didn't look like
[48:35] nothing but he was the Fountain of
[48:38] Living
[48:40] Waters what you were looking at was The
[48:42] Giver of Life wasn't you what you were
[48:44] looking at was the only one worthy to
[48:47] die for our
[48:48] sins what you were looking at was the
[48:51] only one that could pay for you and I
[48:53] right all of the the we were born in in
[48:56] sin we came in the world in bad shape
[48:59] and on top of that we still offended God
[49:01] often when he called us and we turned
[49:03] that death fear didn't we and all of our
[49:06] sin and all of our transgressions he
[49:08] didn't look like much but all the money
[49:11] that the world has to offer couldn't
[49:13] have paid your
[49:15] debt y'all believe it all the friends
[49:19] all the people that could stand up and
[49:21] talk for you couldn't have paid your
[49:23] debt come on couldn't have bought your
[49:26] way in glory it was only one that could
[49:28] have did that and he didn't look like
[49:30] much he didn't look like nothing but he
[49:33] was the Fountain of Living Waters
[49:35] Hallelujah he was the he was the The
[49:38] Giver like he was the King of Kings you
[49:40] can't you can't it ain't enough names
[49:42] that we can call him to to exalt him how
[49:45] high he is y'all believe it Hallelujah
[49:48] then you want to take other names and
[49:49] exalt them other people exalt them and
[49:51] make them walk around like they somebody
[49:54] come on but when you think about Jesus
[49:56] the lowly one the meek one ain't had H
[49:59] know couldn't even maybe afford a pair
[50:01] of shoes sometime the the birds have
[50:03] Nest come on everything got place in
[50:07] life but God didn't have place to lay
[50:09] his head did he come on but yet he was
[50:12] the maker of it all wasn't he Hallelujah
[50:16] come on but what it is I said the enemy
[50:18] makes himself a lot of times more way
[50:20] more appealing I think about it but I
[50:22] say it's what it is you know you know
[50:24] the people they have forsaken the
[50:26] Fountain of Living Waters and human
[50:28] themselves out sisters they always did
[50:31] that always made and what it is we was
[50:33] calling it a tradeoff is what it is come
[50:36] on we always say there's only two powers
[50:39] in the world out of all the kingdoms all
[50:41] there only two powers and that's God and
[50:43] Satan and Satan don't really have no
[50:45] power up other than what you give him
[50:47] over your life because when Jesus rose
[50:50] he said all power ain't that what he
[50:52] said is given unto me in heaven and
[50:55] Earth the devil don't have no power over
[50:57] you than what you give him through
[50:59] unbelief
[51:00] right cuz what is say sin is unbelief
[51:03] ain't it come on that's what it is you
[51:06] know uh I was ministering once on what
[51:09] God allows I said the thing is the devil
[51:11] don't got no power on you but if God
[51:13] whatever happened if God allowed it come
[51:15] on then God God's got a purpose in it
[51:17] but the devil you can't give the devil
[51:19] that power over you am even Jesus
[51:22] standing before pilot he says don't you
[51:24] know I got the power power to have you
[51:26] crucified or set free but he had to he
[51:28] had to straighten them out didn't he he
[51:30] said you wouldn't have no power over me
[51:33] except it been given to you my from my
[51:35] Father which is in heaven other than
[51:36] that you ain't got no power over me let
[51:38] me let me straighten that out you don't
[51:40] got no power over me and you and I being
[51:43] Sons and Daughters of God Christ when
[51:45] he's risen come on all that was in God
[51:47] he poured in Christ all that was in
[51:49] Christ he poured in the church the devil
[51:51] don't got no power over you God has
[51:53] taking us through tests and trials to
[51:55] build our character Hallelujah but other
[51:58] than that the power belongs to God right
[52:01] and he says to many that believe to them
[52:03] gave he power to become what the sons of
[52:06] God the devil ain't got no power over
[52:08] you except for what you give him
[52:11] Hallelujah you can speak the power and
[52:14] give it to him right oh the devil just
[52:16] Dev yeah he got me what you did you
[52:18] spoke it and gave it to him other than
[52:20] that come on God is taking me through
[52:22] something don't worry about it come on
[52:24] and I Ain going to give the devil no
[52:26] glory in it God going to get all the
[52:28] glory come on cuz no matter what you
[52:32] know he say oh Joseph we we we sorry we
[52:35] did like he said uhuh come on he says
[52:38] God did it didn't he God sent me down
[52:41] here you didn't do that God did this God
[52:44] did it because he already knew that what
[52:47] was going to take place and that many
[52:48] people can be save today you didn't do
[52:50] it God Did It Right can't give the enemy
[52:53] no kind of credit no kind of glory god
[52:55] God Did It things that in your life I
[52:58] look at it as as I sharing brother

[54:10] a lot of time we stumbling but he won't
[54:11] let you fall Willie seen that little
[54:13] baby the other night at the little
[54:15] program I kept saying oh every time I
[54:17] thought your little one maybe just
[54:19] learning how to walk but she kept
[54:21] stumbling and falling back and and then
[54:23] one time I think she was doing it on
[54:25] purpose cuz every time she fall back she
[54:27] knew that Mama was going to catch you I
[54:29] was scared I said up up like that then
[54:32] Mama reached out there and grab but the
[54:33] baby was doing that why because she knew
[54:35] that Mama was going to let her fall now
[54:37] come on but what I say is with us now we
[54:39] don't tempt God and by no means right
[54:42] but we ain't afraid of falling why
[54:44] because God got us hallelujah I was
[54:47] saying you know one thing about it I was
[54:50] telling people today I said you know I'm
[54:53] not I don't get intimidated by people
[54:55] people you know I don't get I said the
[54:58] people walk in this plan I don't get
[55:00] intimidated by them I said they might be
[55:02] more skilled and might more no know more
[55:04] than you and all that but that don't
[55:06] intimidate me why because I ain't even
[55:09] trusting in My Own Strength myself I
[55:12] ain't even I ain't even trusting in my
[55:13] own knowledge and my own ability in
[55:15] myself I got an understanding that all
[55:18] this come from God come on just in a
[55:21] moment God can take your memory take
[55:23] your mind take all those things and you
[55:25] can't even troubles shho or do none of
[55:26] that so all the glory belongs to Who
[55:29] belongs to God don't it so why should I
[55:31] be intimidated long as when I wake up in
[55:33] the morning come on God is still holding
[55:36] my hand I ain't worried about it
[55:39] Hallelujah long as when I lay down at
[55:41] night God is still holding my hand I
[55:43] ain't worried about it come on when I go

[56:04] us because it's the truth ain't it come
[56:08] on we got to think that way y'all
[56:10] believe that tonight he's the Fountain
[56:13] of Living Waters you got to think that
[56:15] way nothing can't stop that up you try
[56:18] to stop it up it'll rupture won't it
[56:22] come on it'll find like I say some crack
[56:25] where to get out you can't stop it up
[56:27] it's going to flow ain't it and that's
[56:29] what it is God if you can use anything
[56:32] Lord you can use me come
[56:36] on he says it says stop them uh the
[56:40] people they saying hosan stop them he
[56:42] said if they stop the Rocks should cry
[56:43] out won't they come on God can use what
[56:47] he want can he but my thing is he is the
[56:50] Fountain of Living Waters it's a
[56:51] tradeoff don't trade him off for nothing
[56:54] it ain't worth it is it I was thinking

[1:01:16] springing up on the inside of you it was
[1:01:19] there the whole time but now it's
[1:01:20] springing up come on in the time that
[1:01:23] you needed and it brought you up out of
[1:01:25] that place you were at people say what

[1:01:43] they've committed two evils against me
[1:01:47] come
[1:01:47] on they forsaken
[1:01:50] me God God never forsakes you but we
[1:01:54] forsake Him they forsaken me come on all
[1:01:58] that and and Jeremiah crying out to them
[1:02:01] all they was trying to get them to do to
[1:02:03] repent turn back to me turn back to me
[1:02:06] get those Idols away from
[1:02:09] you put those Idols out the camp get get
[1:02:12] back come on worshiping those other gods
[1:02:15] get back he says I told y'all to you to
[1:02:17] do this to the stranger take them in all
[1:02:19] that you've done the opposite you're
[1:02:20] doing the opposite he said get it out
[1:02:22] put it away from you turn back to me
[1:02:24] come on he said and I I'll bless you he
[1:02:28] says but if you don't the Babylonians
[1:02:30] coming come
[1:02:32] on and then it came to the place to
[1:02:35] where the he cried out so much and you
[1:02:38] know I was thinking about that he was
[1:02:40] crying out and God told him to put a a
[1:02:42] wooden Yol around your neck go stand in
[1:02:45] there and tell them I'm you with these
[1:02:48] you going to be carried away into
[1:02:49] Babylon but then you had a and they knew
[1:02:52] the Babylonians was eating up the
[1:02:53] countries around them come on and they
[1:02:55] were coming for
[1:02:57] Jerusalem but here it is I believe
[1:03:00] hananiah one of those took the sword and
[1:03:03] broke it off Jeremiah neck with this
[1:03:06] prophesying come on prophesied a lie
[1:03:08] though didn't he and the people sided
[1:03:11] with a false
[1:03:13] prophecy rather than the word of the
[1:03:15] Lord why because the word of the Lord
[1:03:17] was calling them back to repentance
[1:03:19] people don't want to repent do they
[1:03:21] people don't want to know want to admit
[1:03:23] that they wrong admit when they exposed
[1:03:27] to where they are in God they don't want
[1:03:29] to
[1:03:30] admit Lord I'm sorry God you exposed me
[1:03:34] help me to get back they don't want to
[1:03:36] get back but he on my man you all right
[1:03:39] everything is all right God is with you
[1:03:42] and God ain't among you come on you know
[1:03:46] you think about Samson all the time he
[1:03:48] was down there up there playing with the
[1:03:51] laa but the Bible says men was lying and
[1:03:53] weight in the chamber to bind him whole
[1:03:57] time he playing with dalila come on
[1:04:00] first a couple times playing around but
[1:04:02] it came that time he said I'll shake
[1:04:04] myself as other times but he didn't know
[1:04:06] that God wasn't with
[1:04:08] him went out there didn't he come on but
[1:04:11] I said
[1:04:12] tonight don't don't forsake the Fountain
[1:04:15] of Living Waters come on as I was I've
[1:04:19] been saying this for the last several
[1:04:20] weeks cuz been looking over some things
[1:04:22] and you know
[1:04:25] where God brought us from and I one of
[1:04:27] my one of my classmates got hired on a
[1:04:29] job with us it's a small world real
[1:04:31] small world but he got hired on the job
[1:04:34] with us and and I pull a phone out my
[1:04:37] pocket it's a old picture with us on
[1:04:39] when we was growing up in the
[1:04:40] neighborhood and he's like man you just
[1:04:42] brought back so many memories so we just
[1:04:44] talking and just talking about you
[1:04:49] know how many of them dead and gone how
[1:04:52] many of them had hard lives how many of
[1:04:54] them in jail and all those things and
[1:04:57] and I say you know see what happened to
[1:05:01] me God I was one of the called out ones
[1:05:05] he's like Ernest man you was doing stuff
[1:05:07] a lot early way and you were you know
[1:05:10] leading the pack or whatever I says but
[1:05:13] I was one of the called out
[1:05:15] ones I says when he called
[1:05:18] me it was something that I ain't know
[1:05:21] from the beginning I couldn't explain
[1:05:23] what was going going on with
[1:05:25] me everybody thought I said everybody
[1:05:27] thought I went crazy everybody thought
[1:05:28] it was just something that just going to
[1:05:30] oh it's going to pass sooner or later I
[1:05:33] said but back then it was something that
[1:05:35] got hold to me come on and I said that
[1:05:39] some of the same places I walk I carried
[1:05:42] the Bible to to talk to the boys and all
[1:05:44] that I said if if every if y'all would
[1:05:46] only
[1:05:47] knew back then how real it was if You'
[1:05:51] only knew it's still real right now but
[1:05:53] I said said if you only knew then if
[1:05:56] everybody could have just came along
[1:05:58] some of us wouldn't have had to live
[1:05:59] those hard lives some of us wouldn't
[1:06:01] have had to suffer because he was the
[1:06:04] Fountain of Living Waters he was he was
[1:06:06] going to make the way for
[1:06:08] us they say well you didn't know where
[1:06:10] you was going yourself Ernest but I know
[1:06:12] who was leading me though I didn't know
[1:06:14] the way I didn't know where I was going
[1:06:16] but I knew that the one that was calling
[1:06:18] me knew the way come on and he's still I
[1:06:21] say he's still the same he's still the
[1:06:24] same today as he was back then he's
[1:06:27] still just as real I said when you look
[1:06:29] over though you wish that that a lot of
[1:06:31] them most you wish all of them would
[1:06:33] have would have know back then what God
[1:06:36] would could have did in their life you
[1:06:38] know some of you say that Destiny and
[1:06:40] all that and that may be true but I says
[1:06:43] that I want I like to think sometime
[1:06:45] what God could have did with your
[1:06:47] life if you would only at that point let
[1:06:50] go and let God have his way you know
[1:06:53] what I was told
[1:06:54] oh you going to waste away your youth by
[1:06:56] some older people you ain't got to do
[1:06:59] all that you going to get old and you
[1:07:00] going to wish you hadn't did live that
[1:07:03] way but it's joy unspeakable and full of
[1:07:06] Glory come on I still ain't old yet I'm
[1:07:09] a little older but I still glad that I
[1:07:10] gave God my life long time ago I'm glad
[1:07:13] that I didn't seek after him but he
[1:07:15] sought after me I'm glad that he didn't
[1:07:17] wait on me to come after him but he
[1:07:19] called after me he's been drawing and
[1:07:20] pulling on me and I'm glad that I had
[1:07:23] the courage amen hallelujah and the
[1:07:26] faith to step out even in then right
[1:07:29] come on aren't you glad tonight that
[1:07:32] you're in the house of
