into the word of the Lord Hallelujah we're going to be coming from Philippians the third chapter 14th verse and from there we'll go to Joshua Philippians 3 14th verse you know this is a pretty good crowd for Wednesday night oh this Friday isn't it so you can see I'm behind my time my days are all mixed up but nevertheless we appreciate you all being here Philippians the third chapter 14 verses I press toward the mock for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus then we ask that you turn with us to Joshua the first chapter Moses my servant is dead beginning at the second verse now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us and father you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord I use that phrase in my uh prayer all the time because it's so true it will always be true father you take care of us even when we're not as faithful as we should be you have held your faithfulness and we realize this night oh God that great is thy faithfulness unto us and we thank you Lord Jesus for you are the only true and living God that is not by hearing of someone else's words but it's a revelation that you have given unto us there's none like you there's none that will come before you or even after you and father we praise you tonight we give you the praise we give you the glory we give the honor and father you're worthy of all praise thank you our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for being the savior of the world for being my lord for being my savior for being my Revelation in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'm going to preach a message that uh I preached in my own church so if I say anything that will pinch you uh know that you're not the first to be pinched We Believe by God's grace that the problem of problems that we've had uh in this message or around the message it's because we have not been to sincere enough or consecrated enough and and I believe that's the hour in which we're living in um here the scripture tells us that there is a Mark that we must press and I want to ask a question which you don't have to answer but in your spirit uh uh you will know you you can answer yay or nay the truth of the matter is I want to say like this how many of us have been truly pressing now we see by the grace of God the scripture tells us that Joshua in Joshua Moses is dead and we're not going to work so much with Moses but we're going to work with Joshua uh because we realize that you know Moses amen is has done his uh uh uh uh uh purpose on Earth and and now the ministry is moving uh on uh to a Joshua Ministry but the Bible tells us in in the Book of Joshua that uh Joshua has no word of his own but he has to follow the words that Moses had spoken and so we realize amen that it is important a man that we know what's been said and what's been laid down for us we understand I understand this is my faith and this is the way I believe that when God opened the word and opened the seals uh God gave us a new a new message it wasn't the message of just of just Pentecost but it was that plus it was an addition to what God wanted us to know and what he wanted us to understand why because the word of God according to revelation 3 here Jesus Christ was put out of the church but in that time God was drawing and pulling a people from every denomination in in every organization to form a bride and and so we realize amen that when the word was opened it was it was like what happened Amen in the days of John when John pointed to Jesus he told his disciples this is the one that's greater than than I am and whose shoes I'm not worthy to loose we find out that in uh in that uh uh setting that everybody that followed John didn't leave John but they stayed with John and and they went all and only a two if I got it right according to the prophet only two of them followed Jesus and we see that same setting we've seen that same thing happen with us it's not about Malachi 4 anymore in that sense we understand what he's done we understand his position and there was a time in history that was needed to know we needed to know that we we needed that Foundation we needed to know everything that God had done through him in order to know what God was willing to do through us and so we must understand by the grace of God Amen all of the things that the brothers and I don't criticize anybody because they were anointed to do what they were supposed to do but I saw a little uh reading the other day and it says the bend in the road is not the end of the road except you make the turn and that's what happened in our day many people fail to take the turn and We Know by the grace of God Amen we are not in building a building it's not straight walls but there are turns that all of us must make and we understand that Malachi 4 taught us that we must make a turn this is what he was talking about it's time to turn and we fail to turn and because we failed to turn we had a shipwreck but there are those now who the word of God is being quickened they're beginning to see and then what the message is all about and the message is not all about a Malachi 4 anymore but it's about Revelation 8 all the way through 11 a bride a people that will prophesy again and you and I must understand that what this message is doing to us if it's not changing you you don't have the revelation that you're supposed to have because this message is to bring about a change the word of God that we are now feasting on wasn't just shoe brand but it was the bread from out of the uh the Veil Amen in everything within the Veil amen no matter what it was it was sanctified it was consecrated with the blood of Jesus Christ had been applied Hallelujah it had a purpose and therefore amen the Shekinah Glory was able to to show its fullness in that place Hallelujah that's where we are tonight Hallelujah and to look back would be the same thing that every Church age has done come on somebody you see it was the unveiling of God when God unveiled himself he was showing it was no not a man it's never been a man it has always been Christ Jesus amen moving through the human vessel and then proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the Revelation the power of this Revelation if it ever sets in your heart you will never be the same Hallelujah Jesus himself had to come to know who he was by the scripture and how can you preach a message without the Bible Hallelujah you could never accurately preach this message without the Bible hello somebody you got to understand Hallelujah that the message itself never did come to contradict it it came to unveil it it came to give this this the letter of the word new meaning and a deeper revelation is that right let me say it like this it came to magnify what was already written is that what Jesus did he came to magnify he said listen your law says if a man or woman be caught in a in the act of adultery they are adulterers but he says let me magnify it if you look upon a woman and and lust in your heart you've already committed adultery hello somebody you see this message came to to do what magnify how I how can I say it the the the New Testament was the revelation of the Old Testament and the message is a revelation of the Old and New Testament Hallelujah it brings it to a full book a full word and a full Revelation why because it's come to produce a Perfect Bride Hallelujah and listen we're all learning but we must move forward and the only way we're going to move forward we've got to be better more consecrated we've got to be more sincere there is no way you are consider yourself bride and you take in your life and dragging it through the mud Hallelujah you can't look at these things of the world be a part of the world act like the world and call yourself bride you are deceiving yourself Hallelujah it is God who sanctifies us Hallelujah is that right even the prophet of God had to come to know who he was is that right at the first he didn't he was Malachi 4 and God unveiled that to him it didn't stop there it kept going little by little year by year and every move he made he grew in the knowledge of his calling and who he was in the scripture and each step he made forward meant more death to self and more consecration so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ she must understand the closer we get to God the more you must die to yourself Hallelujah is that the right is that right Paul listen this is a powerful revelation Paul said listen it's not I that lives I want you to think about that he said it's not I that lives but it's Christ who lives in me Hallelujah in other words God had moved Paul into a position there was no more Paul Hallelujah Paul had no more attitude it was all Jesus Christ so you can understand God is not wanting your body to share it with you but you must die and rot to all of your behavior all of your thoughts all of your desires everything that you was born into this world with Must Die Hallelujah the problem even with most preachers they're not dead Hallelujah is that true Paul said I didn't come to preach myself he said I didn't come to preach myself I come to preach Jesus and him crucified Paul said I don't know nothing everything I've ever learned he said I counted as dumb that I might learn that I might know him in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah that I might even know him in his suffering somebody help me here tonight you see we've got to realize that this calling is a high calling Hallelujah do you know what that means you weren't called by a bishop you wasn't called by a preacher you weren't called by uh uh any kind of Presbyterian but you were called Hallelujah from a high calling above this Earth above this realm your calling came from eternity Hallelujah and because it is a high calling we must treat it as a high calling Hallelujah the problem is we've been treating it like it's just religion and there's so many people in this message who's not even saved oh lordy think about it everybody people who could quote brother Branham quote Paul and Peter and John and never was truly born again they learn the systematic way of worship oh come on somebody they knew all the [Music] other and they were pretty good like the Rich Young Ruler he knew the system knew the do's and don'ts he knew the touch not taste not had or not but that wasn't it Hallelujah and Jesus said accept your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees and the Sadducees you will in no eyes enter in Hallelujah this is why the word of God says it's not by power is not by might but it's by my Holy Spirit Hallelujah and let me tell you something the truth of the matter is we're failing to see it that we've been called to be Miss Jesus Christ Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying we've been called to be Miss Jesus Christ but we find people say well I'm in the message that ain't even it we made it a denomination we've made it some kind of way of system I'm in the message what is that that's like I'm Pentecostal I'm Apostolic you know I'm this I'm that Hallelujah we have been called to be the word and in order to be the word you must die and write to yourself into your ideas oh it's true people get all angry and carry on like they ain't got no sense and you think that's going in the rapture hello that has to die hallelujah look look even those are Friday night the church should be filled but where are they you understand what I'm saying it's not based on that but when you love Jesus and you love worship and you you love to be in the house of God you don't care if it's snowing you don't care if it's raining Hallelujah you don't care what kind of weather goes on you talk to the Lord he says Lord is it your will for me to go to the church and if he says yes you go y'all hear what I'm saying see a lot of times we we're so oh my but I guarantee you it don't stop the people from going to the restaurants in the rain in the cold they're gonna go they'll feed the Natural Body and they forget the spiritual people I'm not trying to fuss but I am so sick and tired of what I see as a systematic worship God hates it and so do I Hallelujah if you can't get stirred until the music goes up something's wrong with you check your experience Hallelujah because you're supposed to enter into this place Hallelujah with Thanksgiving you're supposed to be fired up already listen you know I'm tired in my physical body but my soul is what's controlling now because when your soul Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying don't let this thing become so common to you well you have nothing to offer the children that's coming on after you your nature must be changed you know the problem is we don't pray we don't pray you know you know what they tell me and my wife pointed this out to me the other day it was on a little clipping I don't know whether YouTube or whatever it was they said the Jews prayed three times a day and the Muslim systematically prays five times a day and the Christian prayed one time a day or might pray one time a day and they figured that's going to keep it going shame on us even when it comes Amen to Daniel he knew he need to talk to God three times a day how many of us still read our Bible how many of us study it and and look at it and and you know what I'm not looking for how I can memorize it I'm looking to see how it can be applied I want to change I want to change people and that's what I look for I look for change a change in nature brings about a change of name and a change of name brings about a change in authority huh Jacob was a shyster but Jacob had a change of nature and therefore when he had a change of nature he had a name change and that name changed Israel brought in authority y'all hear what I'm saying you said well brother Brooks I'm the bride well you are if your Nature has been changed Jacob could not his name could never be changed that's why you see Christians still being shysters because their nature hasn't been changed but somewhere you've got to do like Jacob you got a wrestle with the angel but most of us don't want to pray we don't want to get down on our knees sometimes we get down on our knees amen and we think an hour has gone by and we look up and it's only 10 minutes see it shows that you you rush to you you Out Of Tune you're not connected but when you get connected time matters not Hallelujah you can talk to God and he'll talk back to you now I don't know about I don't know whether he talks to you but my God talks back to me I learned to talk to him and I wait till he speaks back to me Hallelujah is that the truth when Jesus Jesus had to overcome death hell in the grave but you know what he did first he prayed hello he had to cut overcome the natural man the natural man didn't want to go to Calvary Hallelujah and most of us don't want to die but you in order to live you've got to die Hallelujah and you got to get down on your knees wherever in your closet in your car in your no matter where it's at but wherever you know you can make a contact Hallelujah that's where you go Hallelujah you got to forget about your neighbor you got to forget about your friend you got to forget about your husband and your wife this is between you and God Hallelujah and you've got to go all the way because this is a higher calling yes sir there was a time we could shout we could dance and we thought that was the ultimate but then we found out that was just the beginning Hallelujah Miriam shouted on the Red Sea Shore but that was just the beginning she still had a journey to make Hallelujah and though she criticize the prophet God smitten her with leprosy glory to God y'all understand what I'm saying and leprosy is a sin is unbelief Hallelujah but it didn't stop God kept on moving now if God called 2 million let's say 2 million out of Egypt think about it each one of those persons were judged by the word and they didn't even know it and you know what they did they failed to go all the way they failed to see it wasn't never a man it was God in a man Hallelujah to them they weren't just looking at Moses they was looking behind that Veil and because they saw what was behind the veil come on anybody in their right mind know that no man can heal another man only Jesus Christ he is the Healer and if he's in you then you can do what he says do is that right oh come on somebody how many years we've gone through and heard that the people said well the prophet of God did this and the prophet of God did that and the prophet of God did this and then the prophet God said I didn't do nothing never did anything he never healed anybody he never saved anybody Hallelujah it was never him it was the Christ Jesus Christ that told him what to do Hallelujah it wasn't his own words and his own thoughts just like it is now they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that relationship wasn't just given to a prophet that relationship was given to his bride Hallelujah come on somebody I believe with all my heart this is a higher calling and the only way you're going to get there is that you got to make up in your mind to stop all of this foolishness Hallelujah because I can't see you doesn't mean God can't Hallelujah come on somebody's the truth Hallelujah you can always tell what's really in a person when they under pressure the real you come out Hallelujah but you see we want that real you to stop it has to come to a stop it has to die and it has to rot come on somebody let me before I get any further with this because I can almost feel it you can't do one thing no man can add one Cuba to his statue it takes the maker it takes the potterer the man who created you he's the only one that can fashion inform you he's the only one that can shape you but the only way he can do it is that you humble yourself and say Lord not my will but thine be done Hallelujah you love the Lord let's move on sincerity this is what I'm working with because you know I have been so alarmed you know by people in the message and some of the things they do and you know this is what gets me because if you're not careful the anointing of somebody else will anoint you that's the truth you have to keep yourself separated every day by prayer amen sincerity it is the quality of being free from pretense and deceit or hypocrisy amen hallelujah oh it's amazing people come up shake your hand love you brother and you know they don't it's hypocrisy hallelujah it's the seed come on somebody but isn't it a wonderful thing when P when somebody can say about a brother and sister you know the sincerity of his or her belief is unquestionable [Music] why because we don't play the foolishness anymore we're tired of being children we've got to grow up into Christ Hallelujah some people they come to church and if if everybody's not shouting and dancing and running you know they say the church is getting dead but what is the church huh when you say that it's the church is getting dead you're getting dead too you see I don't care if if 90 of the people in this place is not responding to the word you if you have a true revelation of Who You Are you will never let the church stop you from worship and praise I don't care sisters if all of the women start wearing their dresses above their knee you have a revelation what God requires for you and you don't care if they persecute you come on somebody because Jacob Hallelujah he shall always persecuted Jacob but when you're born again you shut your eyes to that nonsense you don't care about what people say about you do ya well she said that what who came if you dared you didn't hear it huh glory to God that's what sincerity you see the problem is y'all remember when we first came to the message we put all all of our heart into it and we were so sincere y'all hear what I'm saying but something how we allowed what we saw in other places to affect us and so we got into the systematic worship too Hallelujah you know you don't praise God until somebody else does you know I mean you don't shout hallelujah till somebody else does I mean come on you you you you you look around and God wants you to dance and you won't even dance because nobody else is dancing Hallelujah but I'm gonna tell you something no that's wrong why why should I live right if everybody else is not because everybody else is not me Hallelujah I've been born again Hallelujah yes is that young to me I got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost got me Hallelujah Hallelujah who are you following you following Christ or a man yeah boy y'all really thinking hard on that one they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of God not they that are led by the man y'all understand me those who are Holy Ghost filled are led by the spirit now I don't I'm not taken away from the pastor because he's Holy Ghost Field too and you've got to honor him Hallelujah some people say well I'm so free that's what we did oh he gonna be a nicolaitan no he has the authority and a lot of times people don't want to I don't know why I'm here he didn't nobody talk to me I don't but I'm gonna say it anyway because we got to realize God has set authorities places and positions and in order to honor God you've got to honor those positions y'all hear what I'm saying now if the preacher wrong that's a different story but if he's right that means you got to follow it [Music] is that right let me give you a scripture Paul said follow me as I follow Christ you love the Lord the pride of Jesus Christ will be she is Miss Jesus Christ what qualifies her she's baptized in the spirit in his name right not father Son and Holy Ghost in his name filled with his power robed in his righteousness I didn't say mine I said his Hallelujah you can't even be Sanctified unless you Sanctified in his sanctification Hallelujah you could never get it all right the fact that we needed a savior that's why we need Jesus Hallelujah is that right like I said you got to put all your heart into it Hallelujah y'all know this is so true when it comes down to the word of God when it comes down to Jesus somehow we want to put him on the sideline like you know Simon did in you know what I mean you come to church and he's in the corner there that needs and nobody's attending to him but we have been ordained to entertain him did you all know that we come to entertain Jesus I would never come back to your house if you come to if you're supposed to entertain me and I come in there and you don't even give me a glass of water huh you won't even welcome me and then you got this big cake on the table you got some ham or some chicken or whatever and all the fragrances in the house and you won't even offer me any entertain me y'all understand me and that's the way it's supposed to be when you come to God when you come to this listen whether you come here or not but when you come to the house of God you're supposed to entertain him how with your lips praise at him with your hands clapping and worshiping him with your dance that's what you're supposed to do we used to be on fire huh I did that turn like brother Simmons I must have caught something right there I felt brother Simmons when I did that Hallelujah so you gotta understand by the grace of God you and I must emotions say Lord help me sincerity brings us back to the word sacred and you've been summons by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and right now you say well I want the Holy Ghost but God ain't gonna give you the Holy Ghost if you still living filthy and filthy doesn't mean you're out there doing it but the Bible said even if you are entertained by those people that are doing it there's your TV he said you are just as guilty as the ones that that's entertaining you do you realize what you're doing I'm not going to be long oh Lord it's something about pursue you know you pursue something when you really want something you pursue like the woman with the issue of blood right uh she was you know she was unclean so she couldn't allow the crowd to know she was there but she saw Jesus she broke all the laws and the rules to find Jesus you understand me and she saw him and in within herself she said if I could just touch the hymn of this comment I'll be made whole now I'm preaching something that should have been how can I say it is overdue this is overdue if we had only seen and understood the calling but as we grow and mature we see okay there are things I must get rid of that's not even sinful but I've got to be sacred I got to be holy I got to be dedicated to this calling y'all hear what I'm saying I can't do what everybody else is doing oh come on somebody if I gotta goal by myself we sing that song Lord let me go by myself Hallelujah right so when Jesus in our day and I'm coming now turn the corner the devil was right there when those seals were opened people wanted to disbelieve it they want to say something was wrong with it but let me tell you something is living in me and the more I read this word and that message I put that I don't look for to see some type of brother Branham forgive me for say like this you know what I look for me I'm looking for me this is an invisible Union the word comes to unite with you it comes to your night with me so when I'm reading it I'm looking in it for me I need to know what I'm supposed to do for my day somebody help me here and looking back is not going to help me let me say it like this the preview of the Bride she was on with Christian Soldier marching as the wall in other words she was in a battle but she was marching to what the tune of the word and as she marched forward guess what she began to step higher translation began to happen somebody help me she was being she was literally being pulled from this Dimension to the next just because she was following the word but listen what she was following Calvary the crucified oh my God the blood marching onto wall with the cross of Jesus going on before is that right is that right the prophet God said listen I've taken you as far as I could take you I can't take you no further but he says see those bloody footprints you follow those bloody footprints they'll take you all away Prince the blood and bloody of the son of man the word of the hour will take you if you don't have to worry about it changing you it will change you if you are truly elect chosen of God it will change you Hallelujah Hallelujah you love the Lord how did he call to be consecrated he said wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus huh a Heavenly calling a calling that Celestial calling listen it's the truth even when I was a boy I knew I was different wasn't even saved or the revelation of it anyway but I knew I was different I was the black sheep of my family but I knew God was real I knew the name of the Lord was the Lord Jesus Christ I knew that there was one God and not three no Seminary taught me that it was God I heard his voice when I was being baptized even in the Baptist Church when Reverend fail said I baptized you the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost when I came up out of the water I heard God's voice for the first time he said and what is the name and I carried that question in my heart for years because I didn't understand it Hallelujah but one day I was up at Progressive I had she didn't mean to call that name but anyway Hallelujah I had already promised some people I was coming back to the service and while I was coming let me back it up because I sang with a group out there in the world a gospel group we were just Hypocrites so it's what we would do we would sing and we'd get on the radio and you know how they had on the television the gospel program and we'll do that on a Friday night and after the Friday night we go to the fountain blue the club yeah yes I would feel convicted everybody else carrying their little mini bottles but I'm just saying and I used to sing this song Thank God I've been saved thank God I've been saved yeah and I'm like right I felt so so hip hip hypocritical because I didn't know what saved meant but there was a young lady and I won't call her name that I knew was a sinner but I saw her walking down the street with a long dress on and long sleeves and and she says oh come on up to the church on the hill my mama told me about that church my mama told me I would be saved there because y'all don't know the background of it the week before I got saved I drank myself almost to death and death came in that room and I promised God if you saved me from this anybody know what I'm talking about when death comes out you know it's death and I said Lord if you if you would if you'd not let me die right now I promise you I'll be saying next week people thought I hadn't lost my mind Hallelujah because when I went up there and I walked through that yard I heard that voice that spoke to me when I was a boy at 12 he says be commandment be thou baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and I said yes Lord I went down in the back a bottom part brother Simmons I don't think he remembered this part but I remember it because when I saw brother Simmons man I thought this guy was wicked dressing in white suits and them shiny shoes and you know them big hats and every time I look around he had women around him that's when I would see you I just I'm telling you I really thought he was pushing something you know and I saw brother Simmons and I said if God can save you I know he could save me it's the truth that's my experience and he was standing there and the Poo was already open and everything I don't know how all that came to pass but I told him I want to be baptized he said you understand it I said yes sir and when they baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you don't have to believe this but this is my witness this is what I believe this is what I saw when I came up out of the water I felt squeaky clean I felt light as a feather but just like life almost like this but if it's far more many far more of them all on the walls and I'm screaming look at those lies look at those lights now I don't know whether they heard me screaming but I know I was screaming it I don't know whether it was all Supernatural what but I know what was happening to me and when I came home everybody thought I was crazy this guy Who Loved To Party who love to drink and all that I never was a smoker but you know and they saw I had done change and my brother-in-law said oh he ain't changed and one day after service he came he had a and I've got to get back to the message but anyway after service he had a big a Colt 45 I hope this is all right Lord but I want you to understand because that was one of my favorites so he thought he was going to tempt me and here it was the can was sweating y'all know what I'm talking about Hallelujah there was no temptation at all when God took it from me he took it from me that's the kind of holy ghost that lives today God knows how to sanctify you and God knows how to fill you with the Holy Ghost but you got to have a made-up mind Hallelujah Hallelujah I know this is Wednesday night so I've got to hurry just call to be consecrated the calling of the Lord is not based on on on uh anybody calling you you know it's based upon his calling you right and you know he uses the unlikely person a person who who in the world don't even want those are the kind of people God loved to work with Hallelujah is that right it doesn't matter what others think of you the calling is not Earthly it is Heavenly the call of Jeremiah the call of Josiah the woman at the well though he was a man it was a different calling she's her she had her had her no man we don't know how many times she had me and calling her but this man had a different call Hallelujah and this call took the filth out of her life and brought in purity brought in holiness it was the Turning of a Life by a voice y'all hear what I'm saying it was the change it was the Turning of a Life by a voice now you say well brother was wild did you use the term or use the scripture Moses is dead because when the scriptures were open when the Sears were open it put us back in the time of the Garden of Eden and all Adam and Eve ever had was The Voice the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening y'all hear what I'm saying now we're back to the voice of God Hallelujah and if we are he's the shepherd and we're the Sheep he leads us he guides us Hallelujah even David said no yea though I walk through the valley the shadow of death I will fear no evil that's a powerful scripture Psalms 30 or 23 is powerful he prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemy God purposely does it while he's building your character oh don't you ever say Lord I want to be just like you if you I didn't really mean it prepare Hallelujah because he's going to do just what you ask him to do and trials are going to come tests are going to come everything is going to come your way but you know what he's looking for Out of You Lord not my will but thine be done he want praise even when you're going through trials even when you're going through tests Hallelujah let me say it like this and I'm gonna close in just a bit time of the higher calling Mary and Martha had seen so many things Jesus had done and they knew he could raise Lazarus from the dead and Jesus knew God knew that but see God put them in a terrible place this is what I say terrible because now he's asking them to believe something that never ever has been done throughout history he's literally puts them in a position that either faith is going to kick in our faith is not and you've got to understand amen the voice of God traveled from Mary to Martha come see Jesus is here Hallelujah and what happened let me ask you a question because this is what God shared to shared with me to a True Believer no circumstance become hopeless I'm gonna say it again to a True Believer no circumstance become hopeless he proved it he took Mary and Martha here is a man dead for four days and he said if you believe it you'll see that I am the resurrection Hallelujah you understand me roll away the stone whatever unbelief you have roll it away there's something you've got to do to get to that place to have the kind of faith Hallelujah that even Mary and Martha had can you imagine a man dead and rotten and stinking and God said he's going to live and we look at situations in our lives that's not even near as bad and we struggle God help us you hear what I'm saying God took Mary and Martha to what I call the ultimate the ultimate of life where man has been dead everybody know he's dead full of worms but God had something there because God could have said open up the open it up I'm gonna let you see him no no no the focus was not on Lazarus the focus was on Jesus I am the resurrection if you believe on me you will see y'all hear what I'm saying it wasn't on his sickness it wasn't on his condition y'all hear what I'm saying it was on Jesus who do you say this son of man am and what we need to stop doing is focusing oh conditions and focus on the promise if God says so that's exactly what he means Hallelujah he didn't say how long we must wait but I'm like Joe I'm going to wait till my change come I'm not going to interfere with God's program I'm going to believe God the calling is high and I'm gonna come to this trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and he shall direct yeah right it is God who's doing the building he is the part and we are the clay you know it's like we have things happen to us and we're like oh my God why me think about it you you thinking in the wrong way God has chosen you he chose job he chooses you for certain circumstances and certain trials but we need to do to adapt the job attitude the lord giveth you see because we've got to stop the devil for having any kind of leave way we can't give him nothing don't give him just not even a speck of unbelief block him and how do you block him by praising God thanking God for the condition thanking God for everything he's doing right now because you know he's God that's what I've learned I learned that everything I suffer is is a reason there's a purpose everything I go through is a purpose there's a reason and whether I see all of the purpose or see all all of his reasons I don't no no no but I'm here to worship I'm here to praise him in every condition you know up on the mountain down in the valley Jerusalem is my home that's what I'm talking about we need to stop allowing Satan to to move us like we're out in the outer Court you know what I mean are we out there with the rain and everything the weather is going to affect my faith it ain't affecting me because that's not where I'm living he said if you abide in me and my word abide in you he said you could ask whatever you will the pro see the word can't lie the problem is we need to abide abide abide abide in it stay in the word how do we used to sing that song we understand the word till Jesus come stay there stay there then Jesus come y'all know how we should say get in the word and stay there that's it be ready when Jesus come oh we used to tear that one up I'm almost done I keep saying that but this is my last scripture second Timothy one and nine I'll close on this who have saved us and called us with the Holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace kick the devil out of your mind Lord not according to our works he ain't looking at your works he want to see your faith in him according to his purpose huh let me read that again who have saved us and called us with a holy calling the only Holy One is God calling not according to our words but according to his own purpose and Grace it will always be that always be that always be that Peter denied him three times but it's God's purpose God saw that and God Peter was still the spokesman on the day of Pentecost y'all hear what I'm saying Abraham look what all he did and he still was the father of Nations think about it Peter murder in his mind in his heart he was until God saved him until he got the Holy Ghost he tried to kill that Soldier hey somebody come on but God had a plan for him did God take all of that evil mean stuff out of Peter absolutely so much so Peter was able to write about the divine nature of God oh God is good amen I call it on purpose which was given us in Christ Jesus what before the world began and that's where you get the devil you got to tell him this ain't no new thing what God has done for me was done for me before the foundation of the world and he made me Victorious Hallelujah yeah is that right Paul said he causes us to Triumph I love that scripture because the devil don't want you to quote that to him he wants you to make you make you feel like you're the loser right no as long as you're in Christ you could never be the loser but people of God in closing ask God lord how can I be more consecrated Lord increase my prayer life increase my way of studying and Lord don't let me read the Bible like a a newspaper but I want you to speak to me through that word talk to me personally Lord you are alive and I want I want I want to have that kind of relationship that fellowship with you Lord on a daily basis not every week but on a daily basis throughout the day and whenever you put on my heart to pray give me Grace to bow my knees give me Grace to pray or wherever I might be Lord help me Jesus I've learned one thing to inquire of the Lord whenever I'm asked to do something sometimes I do forget even when it came to the funeral I didn't ask God but then the Holy Spirit brought to my attention you didn't you didn't ask I asked the Lord for forgiveness I'm in training he's teaching me to acknowledge Him in all my ways I want him to direct my path you see I don't want to leave me I don't want to leave myself I need his Shepherd you I need him to guide me to teach me I need him to take me where you know what one thing I do not question on whether I'm bride or not somebody said you'll never know where the Bible said make your calling an election sure you can know that and when you know that you know that you become invincible you may be a child like David but you steal a giant slayer even in your youth so understand by the grace of God the power that God has invested in us he wants to see it used he wants to see it on display let's stand father God let's pray we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we want to be like you so much like you and I know that the life that's in me is maturing into you with this maturing you again patience I gain love long-suffering I gain those attributes of your divine nature and Lord I know that you you Lord that begun this good work in me has promised to be faithful to complete it I rest on you I rest on your promises not my thoughts and my ideas but your word has declared victory in my life Hallelujah and I'm grateful Lord I'm grateful I pray father that you bless the people tonight something I hope was said that would Quicken the people that they would go home or wherever to pray and seek your face and Lord they would want to change that if there is a Revival let them be that Revival help us now give us Grace and to remove all of the trash out of our lives and let us focus on the calling let us be sincere Lord help us to make our lives sacred before you Hallelujah bless us now we have been bought with your blood Lord you paid a great price and father I pray Lord that you would make us conscience of who we are and what we are and that the calling in which we have comes from you and you alone so Lord give us that energy give us that desire give us that unction to pursue the position that you've called us for in your lovely
