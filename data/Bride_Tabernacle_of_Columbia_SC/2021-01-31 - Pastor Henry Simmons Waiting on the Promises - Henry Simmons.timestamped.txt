[26:57] the book of psalms 40
[27:04] and 1 psalms 40 and 1.
[27:07] [Music]
[27:15] i waited patiently
[27:18] for the lord and he inclined
[27:22] unto me and he heard my cry
[27:28] he bought me up also out of
[27:31] a harbor pit and out of the maori clay
[27:37] and set my feet upon a rock
[27:41] and establish my goings

[28:13] be seated
[28:18] in um psalms 37
[28:22] and 7 amen we want to talk to you a
[28:25] little bit
[28:26] this morning about waiting on the
[28:28] promises
[28:30] he's saying standing on the promises of
[28:32] the lord
[28:34] god our savior through eternal ages let
[28:37] us praise his reign
[28:39] i'm standing on the promises of christ
[28:42] our king
[28:43] i'm standing on his promises today
[28:47] amen god promised something amen god
[28:50] keeps his promises amen
[28:54] if god has promised in his word that he
[28:57] would do
[28:59] something the bible says
[29:02] that the word of god when it goes out of
[29:04] god's mouth it should not
[29:07] return unto him void but it shall
[29:09] accomplish
[29:10] that which is senate to do
[29:14] if god sent the word he meant to heal
[29:17] them it heals them
[29:21] amen so god's word will not come back
[29:24] and say god i could not achieve or
[29:26] accomplish what you sent me to do
[29:30] because god's word will accomplish that
[29:33] which he sent it to do
[29:35] and this morning amen as amen as
[29:39] partakers of
[29:40] the divine nature and of the word of god
[29:45] you and i amen that are outsprings of
[29:48] god that
[29:49] amen are partakers of his divine nature
[29:52] amen and we are part of that word
[29:55] amen because we in the beginning before
[29:59] the foundation of the world
[30:01] in the mind of god god thought about you
[30:04] and i
[30:06] and when we were a part of god's
[30:08] thinking amen
[30:09] then god knew exactly what age and what
[30:13] time we would be
[30:14] born and amen and god knew that you
[30:17] amen will catch a hold to what he's
[30:20] doing in the promises of this
[30:22] hour praise god because people go to
[30:25] church and
[30:26] amen they just go through the motions
[30:29] amen
[30:29] but they have no idea the time in the
[30:32] day and the hour they live in
[30:36] and that's why i choose for a sub topic
[30:38] where the concrete is
[30:42] amen where the carcass is
[30:45] he said there were the eagles be
[30:48] gathered together
[30:50] are you with me
[30:53] it seems like something strange but
[30:56] let me just try to get to psalms 37 for
[30:59] a moment
[31:00] and seven
[31:04] psalms 37 and
[31:07] 7. it says here
[31:11] rest in the lord amen
[31:15] rest in the lord amen
[31:20] he said come unto me all you that leave
[31:22] in heaven laden
[31:23] and i will give you rest
[31:26] amen so he says rest
[31:30] in the lord amen if there's any place
[31:34] that we should find rest
[31:35] amen it ought to be in the lord
[31:39] amen we ought not to be weary and
[31:42] amen frighten ourselves amen we ought to
[31:46] be
[31:46] resting in the lord if we're not
[31:50] resting that means we're not in the lord
[31:54] he said come to me all you to leave and
[31:56] heaven laden
[31:57] and i'll give you for your soul
[32:01] so he says he'll rest amen waiting on
[32:05] the promises of the lord
[32:08] on the day of pentecost they were
[32:10] retiring in the city
[32:12] of jerusalem and wait there until you be
[32:15] endured with
[32:16] power from on high are you with me
[32:20] so they were waiting on the promise god
[32:23] promised
[32:24] that i would not leave your confidence
[32:26] that i will come to
[32:28] you i'm going to fill you with my spirit
[32:31] i'm with you but i shall be in you
[32:34] he made a promise that he was going to
[32:37] keep
[32:39] and i said god still keeps his promise
[32:43] amen so much and so that job declared
[32:46] amen joel declared that in the last days
[32:49] said god
[32:50] that i poured my spirit upon all flesh
[32:53] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[32:56] young men should see vegan the old men
[32:58] should dream dream
[32:59] and on that day i will pour out of my
[33:02] spirit
[33:03] amen i believe that peter stood up
[33:06] when they said these men are drunk these
[33:09] men are full of new wine
[33:10] but he said this is that which was
[33:13] spoken
[33:14] of by the prophet joel
[33:17] that in the last days said god
[33:20] that i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[33:23] flesh
[33:25] see that promise that he made enjoyal
[33:29] the promise that he made in isaiah
[33:32] concerning
[33:33] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[33:35] promises of god
[33:37] were always for a certain season
[33:41] amen see in the
[33:44] season somebody says he's our own time
[33:47] god
[33:47] for the season that god amen
[33:50] he made the promise but it was to come
[33:53] forth in his season at the time
[33:56] that god had appointed that word to be
[33:59] fulfilled
[34:01] are you with me so when god made a
[34:04] promise to the children of
[34:05] israel it meant that after 400 years
[34:08] they're going to sojourn in a strange
[34:10] land
[34:11] and they were going to be in bondage for
[34:12] 400 years but after that
[34:15] i'm going to deliver you and somebody
[34:18] said they were in egypt for
[34:20] 430 years are you with me
[34:24] so after 400 years they the bible said
[34:28] the time of the promise drew near
[34:31] amen god knew that it was the seat and
[34:34] it was the time
[34:36] it meant that the promise should be
[34:37] fulfilled so
[34:39] amen god amen moses parents saw that he
[34:42] was a proper child
[34:44] amen and the god amen had ordained this
[34:47] particular vessel amen
[34:49] to be raised up amen to be a prophet
[34:52] amen
[34:53] and to bring the children of israel out
[34:55] of the land
[34:56] of egypt back to the promised land
[35:00] god had an appointed time and god had a
[35:04] vessel that was going to be
[35:05] born in a certain season and nobody else
[35:08] could take moses place
[35:10] because god had ordained for moses to do
[35:13] the job
[35:15] it doesn't matter how well amen other
[35:18] folks were
[35:19] it doesn't matter how good they were and
[35:21] how holy they were
[35:23] god said moses this is your time
[35:27] and god took moses amen on the back side
[35:31] of the desert and he was 80 years old
[35:34] before he was able to accomplish to
[35:36] achieve the

[35:47] fulfill
[35:48] god's plan for the hour and for the day
[35:50] that we're living
[35:51] in but look like time has evaded us
[35:55] and we have gotten too old to fulfill
[35:57] what god said

[37:27] and the voice of god will speak in such
[37:30] a way
[37:30] that it will wake the bride up
[37:34] hallelujah and i believe we have been
[37:37] awoken
[37:39] amen something has woke us up
[37:44] and that is the voice of god in this
[37:46] hour
[37:49] so he says in psalm 37
[37:52] 7 rest in the lord and what
[37:56] wait patiently i i'm going to tell you
[38:01] it's something about patience that's why
[38:04] luke says in
[38:05] i think 21 19 something like that he
[38:08] says
[38:09] in your patient possess you your soul
[38:14] and the bible says in ii peter an
[38:17] account that the long suffering of god
[38:20] is salvation see sometimes
[38:24] it's not enough just to wait
[38:27] but to wait with patience
[38:31] amen you know and keller was talking
[38:34] about
[38:35] keep your focus keep focusing on god

[38:55] lives
[38:56] we must be we must zero in on that
[38:59] and we must keep our focus on what god
[39:02] promised
[39:03] for our lives and what the bride is to
[39:05] be
[39:06] amen and if the bride is to be such
[39:10] a spoken word bride then she must be
[39:14] able
[39:14] to speak the word and she must be able
[39:17] to manifest
[39:18] what sons and god the sons of god
[39:21] and daughters of god is in this hour

[39:36] might be important to
[39:38] somebody it might be important but
[39:39] that's not important to us

[39:44] that is the
[39:45] changing of the body amen
[39:49] amen you all just mean so much oh we
[39:52] keep driving

[39:58] our eyes are focused on one thing lord

[40:08] that would be overcomers in this age
[40:12] that would be those that are hot and on
[40:15] fire
[40:17] amen there would not be a lukewarm
[40:19] people that'll take the rapture
[40:22] there will be a people that's amen

[40:38] manufact
[40:39] amen the the coming of the lord
[40:43] amen it came out they met in 77
[40:47] and they thought amen certainly this
[40:49] must be the rapture time in 88 they
[40:53] thought the whole world is saying
[40:55] amen this is the rapture time
[40:58] people wrote books all over the place 88
[41:01] is a rapture time
[41:03] and then when the year 2000 comes
[41:06] certainly
[41:07] amen six days on the seventh day god
[41:09] rested
[41:10] suddenly this is the time
[41:13] and when 2000 passed by amen

[41:36] later and amen
[41:39] and we're seeing that god made promises
[41:44] and when god made promises amen
[41:47] sometimes we get impatient
[41:51] and sometimes we get ourselves caught up
[41:53] with the affairs of this life
[41:57] sometimes we'll we'll think that uh
[42:00] you know they said in ii peter well
[42:02] since the fathers fell asleep
[42:04] all things continued as a word from the
[42:06] beginning of creation
[42:09] amen but we got to

[43:40] because god might want to bless me and i
[43:42] want to bless somebody
[43:45] you see what i'm saying it calls it the
[43:47] best of men
[43:48] and best of us amen people uh amen

[49:23] he said once you come to the decision in
[49:26] your heart and in your mind
[49:28] that you gonna lay it down then that's
[49:30] when god will step
[49:31] in but you got to make that decision
[49:35] he said what is it if god does it for
[49:37] you then there's no victory
[49:40] there's nothing you overcame
[49:43] he said but the victory is when you make
[49:45] up in your mind
[49:47] that i'm not going to drink anymore
[49:50] i'm not going to smoke my joint anymore

[50:11] sometimes it gets
[50:12] lonely sometimes well i'm waiting on you

[50:32] things get rough
[50:34] he said don't do
[50:37] evil don't don't do it amen

[50:43] every day
[50:44] that's pornography there's fornicating
[50:46] and there's a
[50:47] all kind of stuff that goes on
[50:50] and the young people are being tempted
[50:52] amen and the devil is trying to draw you
[50:54] under that spirit and that power
[50:57] but he said fret not yourself in any
[50:59] ways to do evil
[51:01] don't do it amen it doesn't matter how
[51:04] much
[51:05] i tell you not to do it it's whether or
[51:08] not
[51:08] you're going to wait patiently on the
[51:11] promises of god i'ma wait
[51:13] to god give me a husband i'ma wait to
[51:15] god give me a wife
[51:17] i waited patiently on the law
[51:20] [Music]
[51:21] and he said the lord heard my cry
[51:25] amen the same god that heard your crime
[51:27] when you said lord
[51:29] i want you to save me i want you to
[51:31] forgive me of my sin i want you to come
[51:33] into my life
[51:34] god would do the same thing if you wait
[51:37] patiently
[51:38] [Music]
[51:40] if he was able to do that what about
[51:42] what you're going through right now
[51:44] he'll do it for you but you got to wait
[51:47] patiently on it
[51:51] he said for evil duels shall be cut off
[51:56] but those that what those that wait upon
[51:59] the lord
[52:00] shall what shall inherit the earth
[52:04] amen for yet a what
[52:09] see sometimes it ain't a long time life
[52:12] itself isn't but a little while
[52:15] amen if you look at life itself how fast
[52:18] it's moving
[52:19] it's nothing but a little while we
[52:21] around here
[52:22] amen he said yet a little while
[52:26] and the wicked shall not be
[52:29] are you with me so all your enemies and
[52:33] all the wicked all the stuff
[52:34] people try to say and do to you a little
[52:37] while and the wicked
[52:39] shall not be not like he said
[52:42] that a worry amen

[53:08] yet a little while and the wicked shall
[53:10] not be ye
[53:12] shall thou shalt diligently consider his
[53:15] place
[53:17] and it shall not be
[53:21] but the meek the humble
[53:24] but to me let's just see how humble we
[53:27] can be
[53:29] oftentimes say and you know sometimes as
[53:31] the young person you don't know what the
[53:33] bishop
[53:33] is saying he says you should always say
[53:37] don't ever ask god to humble you
[53:41] the bible said humble yourself
[53:45] you he said you rather humble yourself
[53:48] then ask god to do it
[53:50] because if god has to humble you you're
[53:51] gonna have to go through but if you
[53:53] humble yourself
[53:56] amen it goes back to what the prophet
[53:59] says some things that we got to do

[55:52] and should enlighten themselves
[55:54] in the abundancy of what peace

[56:00] reality brother and sister

[56:05] god wants you to have
[56:06] as a christian god wants us to have
[56:08] peace amen
[56:10] and i believe if we just rest in him and
[56:13] delight ourselves in the lord amen
[56:16] and he'll give us the desires of our
[56:18] heart amen praise god as long as your
[56:20] heart desires to please god
[56:23] then god will give you the desires of
[56:25] your heart

[56:30] amen praise god i want my desire to be
[56:32] his desire

[56:42] my life and god have your way
[56:45] let me just try to do a little bit on
[56:48] where the conquest is that where the
[56:49] eagles be gathered
[56:50] so let's go to matthew 24 for a minute
[56:53] and i'm going to try to not be long i
[56:56] got so
[56:57] much on waiting patiently on the lord
[57:00] waiting on the promises
[57:02] until i just want to just dub into this

[57:27] and whether so ever the caucus is
[57:31] there with the eagles be gathered
[57:34] together

[57:40] and the question was to god's servant
[57:42] what is the
[57:43] they said what is the uh the eagles and
[57:45] what is the caucus
[57:47] amen so let us look at uh
[57:52] the book of
[57:55] job 39 job 39

[58:17] do you really understand what you're
[58:18] hauling about
[58:21] the conquerors is that where the eagles
[58:23] be gathered together

[1:03:31] eagerness be gathered
[1:03:33] what is the caucus and who the eagles
[1:03:38] he says in 39
[1:03:41] in jobs in 27.
[1:03:47] does the eagle mount up at that command
[1:03:52] and make her nest on high
[1:03:56] she dwelleth and abides
[1:03:59] on the rock and upon the jagged
[1:04:04] of the the rock
[1:04:10] and the stun strong pla place
[1:04:15] from hence convince she
[1:04:18] seeketh her prey and
[1:04:22] her eyes behold a fall
[1:04:26] her young ones also suck up the work
[1:04:30] the blood and where the slain
[1:04:35] are there she is
[1:04:39] the young ones is the little eaglets are
[1:04:42] you with me
[1:04:44] the eagle amen they call
[1:04:48] in the bible they call iselle the eagle
[1:04:52] i
[1:04:52] prophet so prophets are called
[1:04:57] eagles amen because they're able to see
[1:05:01] or fall off are you with me
[1:05:05] so with their eagle eye they look and
[1:05:08] they tell you
[1:05:08] things that ought to come amen
[1:05:12] so the prophets are the eagles so where
[1:05:15] is the caucus
[1:05:17] amen the caucus is the fresh meat
[1:05:23] the fresh kill amen because the eagles
[1:05:28] will
[1:05:28] not eat what a buzzard eat
[1:05:32] you remember buzzer to eat dead stuff to
[1:05:34] swollen all off and worms in it and all
[1:05:36] of that
[1:05:37] there's no fresh no the blood is not
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:41] are you with me so the caucus is the
[1:05:44] word
[1:05:46] it's just like the man of fell in the
[1:05:48] wilderness
[1:05:50] and they were to eat that matter the day
[1:05:52] it fell
[1:05:54] but if they try to hide some man and
[1:05:56] keep it back

[1:06:02] and so amen you had to eat on
[1:06:06] monday what god a place there on monday
[1:06:08] you had to eat it then
[1:06:10] because if you try to save it the
[1:06:12] tuesday it wouldn't work
[1:06:15] so what are you saying if i preach
[1:06:18] noah's message and if i build an
[1:06:22] ark it won't save you today
[1:06:26] are you with me if i preach what moses
[1:06:30] preached i can preach it for an example
[1:06:35] to encourage you amen but
[1:06:38] that's not what god has ordained for us
[1:06:41] for this day
[1:06:43] are you with me so the caucus
[1:06:46] amen is amen the fresh
[1:06:50] manner the fresh word
[1:06:53] the word for the day and i will you live
[1:06:56] in
[1:06:57] the eagle is the prophet
[1:07:01] amen the bible says
[1:07:04] amen if we believe his prophets so
[1:07:07] shall we prosper are you what man
[1:07:12] and the bible says surely the lord god
[1:07:14] will do nothing
[1:07:16] but he reveals the secrets to his
[1:07:18] servant the prophets
[1:07:20] amen and where the caucus is that will
[1:07:22] the eagles
[1:07:23] be gathered the ego lets a together
[1:07:27] amen where the fresh manner is
[1:07:31] y'all notice amen there were seven
[1:07:33] church ages
[1:07:35] and there were three there were four
[1:07:37] living creatures before the throne of
[1:07:39] god
[1:07:40] one with the face of a lion one with the
[1:07:42] face
[1:07:43] of a ox one with the face of a man
[1:07:47] one with the face of an eagle
[1:07:50] all right are you with me and as the
[1:07:54] seals were open there were horse riders
[1:07:56] that went out
[1:07:57] but there was when the enemy come in
[1:07:59] like a flood the spirit of the lord
[1:08:01] lifted up a standing
[1:08:03] so when the white horse went out it
[1:08:06] meant there was an
[1:08:07] anointing to come forth like a lion
[1:08:10] they meant to go forward at that
[1:08:12] particular rider
[1:08:14] are you up man so amen so much and so in

[1:09:55] and they mine up with wings
[1:09:57] and they fly so we're not earthbound
