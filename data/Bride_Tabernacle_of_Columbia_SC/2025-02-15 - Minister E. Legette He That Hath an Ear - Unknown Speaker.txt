amen glad to have the pastor and sister Renee back Among Us amen amen amen John amen Chico nephew amen all the sick and Afflicted amen that were SI conflicted amen God is good amen amen I was telling charlot last night I was was I was thinking about something and I rote past a sign that said give God all the glory amen amen and I thought about that I said we got to give God all the glory amen amen out of our Lives amen amen he demands it amen but one thing about it he ain't going to force you to give it to him right He blesses you and that's that's our doe to give him all the glory right no glory to man but it all goes to who God Amen m 11 by the grace of God we start here at the um at the at the seventh verse amen it's a little something that I've been ministering on 7 11 and 7 you got it say amen amen and it reads and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out to for to see a man CL in rayment behold they that wear soft rment are in King's houses you may be seated I'm going to read a little further down by the grace of God but what went ye out uh to see a prophet yay I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I'll send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before Thee verely I I say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist not with standing he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he for and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence and the violent taketh by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied unto John and if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come he that have ears to hear Let Them hear but where unto shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourn unto you and ye have not lamented for John came neither eating nor drinking and they say ha the devil and the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold behold a man gluttonous and a wine biver and a friend of the publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of her children may God blessed the reading of his word this tonight by the grace of God just for a moment I want to minister and it's just a little continuation on I was talking about the call last week but I want to talk about he that hath an ear amen he that hath an ear you know what says many of times you know uh you can read read something but don't understand it amen amen and that's what that's what I believe has been a plague throughout all world history you know the people not saying that they didn't have scriptures or things for their day that they were looking for but though they read them they never understood them right just to have the the letter or intellect of the word that won't do you no good without no understanding right because once you know we in understanding that we talking about is not not intellectual understanding but the revelation of it right the revelation of the word to cause something to it'll open your eyes and your ears amen but we find that we always found that you know the people had eyes but they couldn't see right they had ears but they couldn't hear even the ones that was following the the the the messengers for that day they had eyes but they couldn't see amen ears but they couldn't hear exactly right so the thing about it is what what gives you the ability to hear I said he that hath an ear but what gives us the ability to hear come on what gives you the ability to see is the Holy Ghost amen am but sometimes you know people forget all about the Holy Ghost forget all about the spirit but the spirit is what brings life to the word amen you know you can have just a letter of the word but it takes the Holy Ghost to come and Quicken the word amen come on but that's forgotten a lot of places y'all believe that I know it is we get that but we we get so much intellect but the Holy Ghost is what brings life to it and that's what you know I I was saying the other day you know when when Israel was coming and and swallowing up all the other nations in the land they weren just afraid of Israel just because of Joshua and Israel but they knew that they had the supernatural among them amen and that's what made the other nations frightened because the supernatural was among them cuz they can look at Israel and knew that they were a small people they were a group that just came out of slavery for so many years but yet a Red Sea opened up before them amen yet they were in the wilderness for all those years and they survived not even their shoes was wore out right come on so when they looked at that nation that didn't even seem like they had a home but yet they had they had a prophet among them right they had signs and wonders they ain't even had to fight many of the battles God fought all the battles for them didn't he but the Supernatural is what made the difference didn't it I remember once when all the kings got together because they knew Joshua them was coming and they started calling out to each other just like demons do today they start calling out to each other let's bond together because Joshua coming right but I hear in the scriptures what God told Joshua don't be afraid the Bible says that they was like the multitude of the Sands of the sea or whatever it was the other nations was and they gathered themselves together to go to battle but God told Joshua don't you worry about how many don't pretty much don't even look at the situation that's at hand he said tomorrow they I will deliver them all up slain before Israel right and he said I want you to take their horses hack them the church hack them what because God meant business didn't he and that's what it is when you understand that this ain't our battle amen come on now come on Amen the battle is not ours but The Battle Belongs to who it belongs to God Don't It come on and I don't know but I know one thing God is mighty in battle amen come on he ain't never lost one did he so when we looking at it you know when we trying to intellectually or look at the word and trying to intellectually figure it out then that'll make us you know sometimes worried about this and worried about that but when we're not trying to intellectually figure it out right because the Holy Ghost down revealed to us that we shall overcome Hallelujah we've already overcome by the blood of the Lamb come on how important that blood is Right amen so the Holy Ghost revealed that to you that hey you've already overcome because I've you live because I live Hallelujah so no matter what comes our way what kind of condition we find ourselves in be not dismayed be not discouraged the Lord is going to fight all our battles amen come on and that's what that's why I was saying the other week you know um I was picking at uh uh uh sister pan and Ma they was getting on me telling me I'm a I'm a republican cuz we're just talking about politics just you know and I says the thing about it is we a ain't governed about who's ever in the White House who's ever doing that we're not governed by this government right but our government is of god ain't it am so even if they talking about shutting this down shutting that down you got to remember that I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging for bread that's the government that we up under hallelujah amen the government that we up under you know he'll supply all our needs according to what his riches and Glory right amen they can shut down the the Medicaid Medicare whatever they want to do come on what are we governed by I am the Lord thy God that Health thee right come on we governed by with his stripes we are healed God got I was saying Sunday God got better medicine than all the doctors amen come on all the pharmacist don't he amen and that's the truth but what it is you got to believe that right amen amen come on but I says that you know what it is sometimes we can read and and don't don't un understand what you're reading right come on and it takes this you know sometimes we and all the time we we read the scriptures and things but even in Reading we get it retain it in our minds right in our spirit but I believe in the time need what happens and many of times in our hardest trials and tribulations we praying looking for God to move and and the word there something about the Holy Ghost he quickens the word that's already in you amen amen and it and and when he quickens the word that's in you it's it it's power in that come on something quickens in you right especially like you say when you when you're sick he said with this Stripes something quickens in you right come on and you might even start feeling worse but already your spirit is rejoicing because you know right like job he said I know that my redeemer live how can he have faith in the situation that he was going through because he knew who God was right and when you know who God is whatever situation you in you going to have faith in it amen come on you going you going to be rejo you ain't going to be walking like those sing without hope because you know I know my redeemer liveing come on Amen though he slay me yet I'll trust him why because I know who he is he hung the stars in the sky didn't he he created the worlds the mountains all these are the work of his hands amen come on amen hallelujah amen that's the truth ain't it amen but you know I says that so so we're not we're not moved by these things right amen I like how I believe it was Paul he said none of these things move me right come on what if God I believe that you know in when we talk about a squeeze when we talk about a squeeze it look like all of your your resources are dry up right amen The Squeeze come on the world look like all the resources are dry up right amen but when the resources dry up I can hear God saying get the by the Brook right amen amen come on Amen I believe that amen hallelujah get get by the Brook come on I don't know about you but I'm looking for God to do Supernatural things cuz when the enemy when he coming in that's what the scriptures is got to come alive to you come on somebody oh we got this come on no the Bible's got to become alive to you you got to be able to look at present day situations and see it in the word hallelujah and if God did it for them Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and what forever if he did it for them he's that same God he'll do it right now same situation same God same results ain't it come on I believe that tonight you know but what it is that's why you know a lot of things happen among the people but they didn't have eyes to see it did they amen come on didn't have ears to hear it but I like how Jesus was telling him because even John said go ask him is he the one or shall we look for another right amen but what Jesus said is the perfect answer what you see stay around a little while what you see go tell John what you see come on Amen and when John you go back and tell John what you seeing things he here he'll know then right hallelujah amen because the things that was happening around them should have opened their eyes to what that this is the Living Word right we've been hearing it we've been waiting on it but things they saw should have opened their eyes and say this is the Living Word right amen amen this is the word you know when that woman at the well when she she was looking for The Living Word though wasn't she amen she might have been in her condition but she was taught to look for certain things right so when Jesus did a certain thing she said we know when the Messiah come he'll do this amen come on and when he told her I'm he something happened to her didn't it that's what it is she had ears to hear it didn't she she had eyes to see it Hal amen something Quicken and that's what I said don't miss your day in this visitation come on God has called you out to bring you in I believe that amen come on but we get relaxed on the journey God has brought us out to take us in don't get relaxed amen when all these things happen around us don't let Don't Let Jesus say hey I mean don't don't let the spirit say hey this is what it was but you missed it don't miss it I said God I don't want to miss it but I want to catch whatever you doing in this season Lord don't do it without me open my eyes open my ears Hallelujah but it's going to have to take the Holy Ghost doing that now come on how you got to be down on your knees in prayer to walk spiritually sometime come on I believe that amen hallelujah I thought about it I said one one thing about it I said I said the call come on this hour and we'll say it again this every cycle of time had a voice had a call come on that went up this didn't it amen come on was was talking about Sodom in the days of Sodom it had a cry it had a voice didn't it people around couldn't hear it cuz they was having too much fun doing whatever they doing living in pleasure amen right but the crowd was so wicked that God had to come down send angels to go investigate is it all together what we hearing and I said same thing even about America today same thing ain't it come on we can play like all this but but Sodom and if the same cry going up amen hallelujah amen ain't it and I believe angels are here investigating too amen come on he did it back then why he doing it now ain't he come on but what is that what is that when we know that destruction is coming come on I like how he told lot he said flee to the mountain now we know the types and all that but I say said get out of here this city get ready to be destroyed ain't it come on but yet some people the Bible says why he yet linger come on what you lingering for amen come on why we at ease in Zion Hallelujah come on but you know the Bible said God being merciful and he's still being merciful today I believe that am come on amen he longsuffering amen God is still waiting amen ain't he waiting on somebody to get stirred up hallelujah amen waiting on somebody to say Lord I if nobody don't go I'll go go amen I was listening that song uh uh uh before I come to church if I'll go if I have to go by myself amen come on that's more than just a song Amen come on Amen say I pray if I have to pray by myself amen hallelujah my mother brother sister father wife children you got to pray somebody got to pray amen you know why Sodom was getting ready to be destroyed I believe Abraham was praying wasn't he amen Lord if you find this many find that many but the problem was the hour was so wicked he couldn't even find 10 amen amen and as it was then it'll be now right don't think that everything is EAS right or they just all right no oh no come on time to get right with God and do it now right come on hallelujah how many believe that tonight but I said he that got an ear can you hear the cry that's going today come on do you hear can you see the signs of the time come on that's a question amen can you hear it hallelujah amen can you see it thank come on but just as the devil is working God working too amen come on Amen can you hear the spirit saying come up Heaven Hallelujah Lord can you hear I I said Lord I can hear you saying come up here I can hear you saying draw now unto me Hallelujah come on get up under my wing now come on let me let me shout to you from the storm that's ahead I can hear him saying that you know I was thinking about that eagle I was looking at a documentary and and some of those Eagles way up in the mountains when the bad snowstorm come they'll sit there over those those those little eaglets and they'll hover over them and they whole eyelids and everything will be iced over but they doing that just so those little eaglets can live Hallelujah come on because if they know that if they don't cover them up they'll die right those little Eagles might be trying to get out but mama know that you got to stay up under my wings in order to survive through the night every night they got to stay over them Hallelujah come on just for them to live now amen hallelujah now I say sometimes you try to this come on you got to stay up under his wings amen the wings of Jehovah you got to stay up under those wings amen amen come because it's a cold night it's a dark night it's hard night Hallelujah but you got to stay up under them wings so he can protect you Hallelujah you might not think you need God protection but you need his covering amen you need him to watch over you and keep you through the night I don't know about you but I pray God keep me watch over me protect me through the night Hallelujah come on I need God every day I don't know about you but I need God every hour every minute I need God right sir as we were saying the other week I say it again like David say y though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death Hallelujah that was quickening to me because so many people are angry today ain't they that's right people mean and angry amen everywhere you go ain't it amen come on violence like the brother was saying all over they mean and angry amen if we ever walk through the valley in the shadow of death is now ain't it but the only thing about it like he says I'll fear no evil because thou are with me hallelujah amen amen ain't that a blessing amen come on that that's what it is what you think I was saying the other day some people say oh those are the baby scriptures for the kids all scriptures are given by inspiration of God right he ain't no baby scripture that little what you call baby scripture don't you know that's going to get you through the struggle hallelujah amen what you call baby don't you know that's going that little what you call baby going to get work a miracle for you come on Hallelujah all scriptures giv inspiration amen I believe that tonight am but I said what he that hath an ear many of times the the people they didn't have uh it said they they weren able to to um hear what God was saying right wasn't able to do it man I miss my glasses tonight God knows that's rough ain't it cuz I can't even see my notes but God knows what he doing amen maybe you don't want me to look at him but I say you know one thing about it in every cycle of time you know God knows what he doing don't him am you know one thing I want to say tonight one what's important to you and I today is we got to stay with the word amen that's very important true true sir you know we'll studying the other night the prophet God was talking about the Pentecostal he said within a 100 less than 100 200 years he says that there'll be worse off in the Catholic church because of the drifting amen that's powerful amen he said took the Catholic Church 2,000 years to get that condition but the Pentecostal Church will be worse off he said because of the drifting what was the drifting away the drifting away was from the word amen come on Amen anything nothing wasn't supposed to take you away from the Bible can I say that tonight amen nothing amen come on Amen it it the spirit supposed to lead the spirit leads you back to the what word anything that takes you away from it you drifting right then you find yourself all out there in a mess what how you getting there because you left the word and the word is the Bible you left the Bible didn't you amen come on Amen how many believe that tonight amen come on I said but I that that hit my spirit I said Lord come on I don't want to drift right amen if I drift let me drift on back to the word right come on am I drifting let me be drifting off deep into your word hallelujah not just a letter of it but by Revelation let me hear what you're saying let me see what you're saying let me see what you're doing open the bi open the word the Bible open it up to me God Amen come on Amen even though we talk about the seals people reading it still got seals on it amen come on Amen but it was supposed to what it is that's what it is the Holy Ghost is going to lead and guide you to all truth amen we depend on the Spirit come on I don't know I we depend on the spirit amen come on the open Quick in the word you know when the spirit is quick in the word because it'll be living amen amen it'll be more than just we preach a good Ser it'll live amen come on I like how when when the angel told told Mary he said about what the uh Jesus was coming she said be it unto me according to Thy word right amen come on it wasn't just word it was live it was going to live Amen in her womb it was going to start living right and it came forth that's what it is when the Holy Ghost get get in there it's going to live amen it's more than just we quoting talking but it's living Hallelujah I said God that's what we need we need Living Word come on we got situations trials and battles I want a Living Word I want something that's alive that's going get me out of where I'm at come on Hallelujah I don't want to be long tonight but it's got to be living now come on think about that the word got to live come on other than that won't do you no good come on Amen Jesus and that that's what the thing about it is he he told the F Pharisees know as Isaiah he said well did Isaiah's prophesies of you got eyes and can't see ears that can't hear come on Amen come on you like why cultes right in there Harvest and dead men bone and all corruption you need to live hallelujah amen and he is life right come on Jesus when he opened the word he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me come on the Holy Ghost is here hallelujah amen come on Isaiah to he has anointed me to preach the gospel Hallelujah come on not not I'm doing it on my own but the spirit anointed me right the Holy Ghost is here to bring It come on he said this day in your ears the scriptures are fulfilled right come on in your ears can you hear it's living today Hallelujah right no longer you going to hear about it the time is now that broken hearts going to be mended time is now that prison doors going to be open time is now that the WR the part going to have the gospel preach them this is the time we liveing now Hallelujah and I believe that we living right now come on come on but it's got to become real to you right other than that we said just a jump shout all those things right but he that ha an ear you know when when when when the word is living that's that's what it is when the word is living that makes all the difference in the world Amen don't it
