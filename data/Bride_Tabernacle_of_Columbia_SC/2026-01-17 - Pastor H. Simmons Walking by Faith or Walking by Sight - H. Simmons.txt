Love you more than anything. We thank God for everyone to press your way out tonight in Jesus Christ's name. And those that are listening in as we stand for the reading of the word, let us bow our heads in a word of prayer. And if you have a special request, you can make it known by uplifting your hand. Father, in the precious name of Jesus, we thank you for another day's journey. Lord, thank you for watching over us. Thank you for keeping us, Lord God. Thank you, oh God, for blessing us to see this day, oh God, for this is the day the Lord has made. I will rejoice and I'll be glad in it. So, Father, I pray, God, that you'll touch those that are on the prayer list, those that have hands lifted and have needs, oh God, may you meet every need according to your riches and glory. May you heal the sick. Amen. May you look upon uh oh God our sister oh God that's uh Lord God going through trials and tribulations Lord and father sickness and cancer and all kind of diseases Lord and look upon all those that ask us to pray for them Lord Lord God we lift them up now in Jesus' name. Father bless the people of God tonight with the word of God. Amen. God is good. I thought about some names that people call and text and so forth. And we were lifting those people up in prayer, but I don't want to call their names out like that. But by the grace of God, we still lifting those different needs up with so many afflictions and sicknesses in the land. Well, 2 Corinthians 5 and 7. 2 Corinthians 5 and7 says, "We walk by what?" &gt;&gt; And not by what? &gt;&gt; Sight. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. God bless. Reading the word. You may be seated. We walk by faith and not by sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the subject is faith or sight or walking by faith or walking by sight. Whether we know it or not, subconsciously often times people even that say we're Christians, a lot of times we want to see it before we believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we trust have more confidence in our five senses than we have in the sixth sense which is faith. We believe our sight more than we believe our faith. And we know that faith in Hebrews 11:1 is the substance of things hoped for. It is the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we talking about faith, we're talking about is it's opposite of sight. We don't have to see to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to believe and we'll see. So by the grace of God, prophet of God was saying some things here. He said as today's church is full of mental believers. He said, "The day church is full of mental believers who endorse the virgin birth, the shed blood, going to church, taking communion, and are not reborn at all." Even so, in the third age, the pilgrim's age was the same problem. human faith wasn't enough. Then it is not enough now. It takes the very faith of God, the son of God, to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord of glory into the temple and not made with hands. It takes let's go to Galatian to look at this. What what was said Galatians 2 &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. We don't want to talk about walking by faith or by sight. We said we walk by faith not by sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I it's just that we say that but are we really doing it? Are we walking by faith or are we walking by sight? Now our mouth might say we are and mentally we have a mental faith. Um and that mental faith is that we confess with our mouth but don't believe it in our heart. But if we confess with our mouth and believe it in our heart, then God will do something for us. Sometimes we have to stand so firm even if he said Abraham against hope yet believed in hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then they said, "Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but he was strong in faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing that what God has promised, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was able to perform it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must believe that God can perform what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we believe it in our intellect, it won't hold out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For your faith will be tested and it will be tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's real and genuine, it'll hold out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not your faith. He's saying the problem of God is bringing out. It's not your faith. As Habaca said, the just shall live by &gt;&gt; his faith. &gt;&gt; His faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not your faith, but his faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Galatians 2:20 here says, he says, "I'm crucified to Christ. Nevertheless, what &gt;&gt; I live. But he won't he wants you to put emphasis. Yeah. He says, "Yet not I." You know, it it's not me that's living now &gt;&gt; because I've been crucified. &gt;&gt; Because I'm dead. I've been crucified. I died. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to by faith in what Jesus did for us on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he took our place on the cross. When we should have died and went to hell, Jesus did it for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He died in our place. &gt;&gt; So Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live." But he caught himself. He said, "Yet not &gt;&gt; not I." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. We got to realize it's not, you know, it's not us that's kind that's living this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we cannot live the life. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE DO, we'll never be able to live the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Paul said, "IT'S NOT I." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm crucified with Christ." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAYS, "WE MUST DIE DAILY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. It must be a daily dying out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let sin reign. Don't let sin have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Amen. WE HAVE TO DIE OUT TO OURSELVES and our own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't know how to adjust and uh maneuver through this life. We it it has to be something beyond us because if we trying to, you know, do and know how to do it because we're in this fleshly body, this carnal body and you got and and the flesh calls for food. It calls for water. It calls for you to go to work and and get a job and all of these things and then you you it calls for those things to take care of your human responsibility. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WHERE IS the human responsibility? &gt;&gt; Even everything we do and everything, Amen. we try to achieve in life, WE MUST ALLOW GOD, GOD, YOU DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I GOT TO SAY, LORD, YOU DO IT. It's your will. &gt;&gt; When I'm walking, when I wake up in the morning, it's because of your grace and your love TOWARDS ME. &gt;&gt; EVERY STEP AND EVERY move that I made. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said in him we move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have our being. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God. Amen. Is causing us to do whatever we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we give him all the honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Everything that is done, we do it in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether it be in word or whether it be in deed, whatever you do, do it in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can't do it in his name, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, it's because our reasoning and our human intelligence and our intellectual mind that we do things that are contrary to faith. And because we walk by so much of these five senses and we let them control us, it's because we Amen. uh are are not guided by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to walk in the spirit and we got to live in the spirit. We need the Holy Ghost. And without the Holy Ghost, we won't be able to live and walk in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And walk by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but what? &gt;&gt; Christ." &gt;&gt; And that's what we see. If you know who's living, it's not me that's living now because I surrendered my life to him. And I said, "God, you take control of this vessel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your house. Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God, I'm bought with a price and I'm not my own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My life is not my own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. There we realize our life is not our own. Amen. It belongs to Jesus Christ. He died for me and paid the price that I can have this new life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This born again life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This new creature that I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This new creation that I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because of him that I live and I move and I have my being. &gt;&gt; It's because of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of him that workketh in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To will and to do of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS UNTO GOOD WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's him that's living now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It's not me living anymore. It's not you should be living anymore. It should be Christ living. &gt;&gt; Amen. The life that I'm living, I'm living. Amen. Because he lives. &gt;&gt; I can face tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's living this life. &gt;&gt; Okay. It says, "I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but what?" &gt;&gt; Christ liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can it sank deep enough to you? Let it resonate with inside of your spirit, man. And could the word, Amen, take faith to that word and let it ignite the word in you and cause that word to be materialize that it, Amen. It grips your soul. It grips your inner man that it takes hold of you. Amen. Then it begins to manifest himself through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word began to Amen. ignite. Amen.

Be and it becomes life in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Not dead letter but life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes your faith. Amen. To ignite this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And cause it to be made manifest. Something got to quicken you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost got to quicken it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I'm understanding now. IT'S NOT ME THAT'S TRYING TO DO RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S HIM THAT I'M dependent on." &gt;&gt; AMEN. COME, LORD JESUS. &gt;&gt; COME AND ENTER. Come and live through me. &gt;&gt; Live in me, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I'm I'm here. Amen. To just a vessel.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Praise God. in this age. Now, by the grace of God, if we go a little further, we walk by faith, not by sight. Numbers 13. I know it's familiar, but I just want to see whether we can just make it simple, but it may be a rehearsal, but nevertheless, it's real. See, sometimes we can't see our way. Sometimes we can't see, we can't understand it. what God all the blessings and promises God g made us and gave to us. Sometimes it's things in our way to block and to blind us and to us and to hinder us. Things in our lives that we are looking at because our five senses have told us different from what the word of God has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can listen to your five senses or you can listen to God. The God that loves you. Love, faith workketh by love. You can listen to the word or you can listen to your five senses. What you hear, what you see. You know, a lot of times people talk themselves out of heaven. They're so busy concerned about the preacher, concern of hearing about the sister and brother and everything. They keep their mouth blinging blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and they talk theirel right out of heaven. Are you with me? And what they're talking about? They're talking about the five senses. They're not talking about maturely mature things. Amen. Being a part of God. Whatsoever things are lovely. Whatsoever things what? Whatsoever things appear. Get it fast. Fast. Philippians 4. What?

And whatsoever things what &gt;&gt; and whatsoever things and and if there be what &gt;&gt; if there be &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; So instead of thinking on those things we we talk ourselves out of heaven. We thinking on and then we talk about what we thinking because a word is a thought. When you when you speak it is what you're thinking. As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So we speak on things. It it tells us what what realm we in, how much maturity we got. Amen. If a person was judging your speech and they were English teacher, they could tell what level you on. Are you with me? If he was a mathematician, they could tell, Amen. whether you can do calculus or whether you can do oh whatever these things are. You know, they can tell what level you on. So, spiritually speaking, God wants you to be on a level that you're above the world. You're no more of the in this world. You're no more of this world.

Our ways are not yours. They're so much higher. God, I pray as the word went forth tonight, Lord, as we're trying, oh God, to get out of the way, Lord, and to burst loosen to that realm of faith, oh God, to where all things are possible. I believe it's RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE WAITING on you to reach out and grab it. You can be healed tonight. YOU CAN BE DELIVERED TONIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE SAME WAY YOU CAME TONIGHT. Oh Jesus, REACH OUT AND TOUCH HIM as he's passing by. How many want to reach out and touch him tonight? How many don't mind lifting their hands and say, "Lord, I want to touch you.

COME ON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And and and just remind yourself of where God brought you from. &gt;&gt; And say, God, if you done that, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I always talk about David. That's what it is. You got to revisit. David revisited those those days in the wilderness with those sheep, didn't he? And he says, "Come on. Every time a a a mountain or trial come, you it might be big. The devil throw it there. You look at it, but one thing about it, you can look back cuz you got a trophy case." Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY." Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have been here right now. &gt;&gt; Praising God with joy in my heart. Come on. &gt;&gt; Peace in my mind. I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

That's just one thing about it. You know, God, that's what it is. You can be walking in the middle of a storm all around you, but just got peace. &gt;&gt; Peace like a river. Come on. Everything can be falling apart all around you, and it's something about that inner peace. Hallelujah. Lord, &gt;&gt; you know, he he gives you that inner peace. You don't worry about that. People look at you all confused, but one thing you know, God's got it all in control. And when I get done, my testimony going to be greater than the trial that I've been through. Hallelujah. How many believe that tonight? Y'all feel all right? I feel all right tonight. Amen. God is good. Brother Pastor Palmer, you want to close us out in a word of prayer? Amen. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God, &gt;&gt; thank you for your grace. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for your word.
