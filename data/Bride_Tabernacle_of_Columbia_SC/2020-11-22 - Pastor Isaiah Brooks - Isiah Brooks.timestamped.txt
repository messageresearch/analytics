[55:38] and he said unto me take eat
[55:41] take it and eat it up and it shall make
[55:44] thy belly bitter
[55:46] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet
[55:49] as honey and i looked
[55:52] and i took the little book out of the
[55:55] angel's hand and ate it up
[55:57] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[56:02] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[56:06] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[56:09] prophesy
[56:10] again before many people and nations and
[56:14] tongues
[56:15] and kings you love the lord
[56:18] one more scripture psalm 62
[56:21] psalm 62
[56:26] this is the day and the hour that we
[56:28] have so looked
[56:30] forward to we're talking about the
[56:33] coming of the lord
[56:34] and we realize amen god
[56:38] as i said yesterday
[56:41] friday god interprets his own word
[56:47] in the way he choose to reveal himself
[56:52] and we're thankful that god
[56:55] is yet interpreting his word
[56:59] and it is important
[57:02] that you come to the knowledge in the
[57:04] revelation of who you are
[57:06] that you are the interpretation of the
[57:12] word for this hour
[57:14] psalm 62 6-8
[57:19] he he only is my rock
[57:23] and my salvation he is my defense
[57:28] i shall not be moved
[57:33] and god is my salvation
[57:37] and my glory the rock of my strength
[57:41] and my refuge is
[57:44] in god trust in him
[57:48] at all times ye people not some of the
[57:51] time
[57:53] all times
[57:56] pour out your heart before him
[57:59] god is a refuge for us
[58:04] salah that means meditate on it
[58:07] think on it let us pray
[58:10] our gracious father god we come before
[58:12] you lord it's homeless we know how
[58:14] we thank you for your amazing grace
[58:18] we thank you for being so good to us
[58:21] and oh god you have been
[58:24] more than enough more than enough
[58:28] and father my cup runs over hallelujah
[58:32] and we're so grateful we're so grateful
[58:36] to all that you're doing for us we are
[58:39] anticipating lord the changing
[58:44] of the body we're looking forward to it
[58:48] because lord we so long to see
[58:51] you come and we know lord god that you
[58:54] have
[58:55] appeared to us and we love your
[58:58] appearance
[58:59] and you said by god those of us who love
[59:02] your appearance that you will one day
[59:04] change us from mortal to immortality
[59:09] father we thank you for your grace we
[59:11] thank you for your mercy
[59:13] and we pray lord god that you bless this
[59:15] service in a mighty
[59:16] mighty mighty way in jesus christ's name
[59:19] we pray
[59:20] amen you may be seated
[59:24] at home i have to take it kind of slow
[59:27] because
[59:29] uh we have various languages
[59:32] in our church we have the french and we
[59:35] also have
[59:36] the swahili and so therefore we have
[59:39] sometimes two
[59:40] interpreters interpreting uh
[59:44] the the word and so therefore i have to
[59:47] take
[59:48] my time to to not only speak it but
[59:51] pronounce it so they can understand it
[59:54] because to them i still have that little
[59:56] southern accent
[59:57] and it's kind of difficult for them to
[59:59] understand me sometimes
[1:00:01] because they're used to hearing the
[1:00:03] british english
[1:00:05] and and so i told them i don't know that
[1:00:07] one
[1:00:07] [Laughter]
[1:00:10] the only english english that i know is
[1:00:12] the american english
[1:00:14] and so therefore i told them i said now
[1:00:16] if you think
[1:00:17] that uh my accent is is bad because i
[1:00:20] can't hear it anymore
[1:00:21] uh i said you need to you know let's go
[1:00:23] down to you know charleston and you know
[1:00:25] mullins and
[1:00:27] places like that and you know and let's
[1:00:29] see how much
[1:00:30] english english you will understand so
[1:00:33] we thank god for his grace we thank god
[1:00:36] for his mercy and
[1:00:37] i've been preaching on the rock he is my
[1:00:40] rock
[1:00:42] and you know i don't think you know i
[1:00:44] think sometime we
[1:00:45] when we say rock we don't go uh no
[1:00:48] further than the the very
[1:00:50] very physical makeup of what iraq is
[1:00:54] uh but a rock is something in the bible
[1:00:56] is it talks about something greater than
[1:00:59] just the physical aspect of sand being
[1:01:02] pressed together and
[1:01:03] and becoming hardened uh because of heat
[1:01:06] and
[1:01:06] pressure you know that's what really a
[1:01:08] rock is little pebbles
[1:01:10] of sand you know pressed together but
[1:01:13] you know i i want to also talk about
[1:01:15] uh a new a new message a message of
[1:01:19] of grace and it sounds like i'm
[1:01:22] coming with something new but i'm not uh
[1:01:25] because
[1:01:26] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:01:28] and forever
[1:01:30] now we we read there in the in the book
[1:01:32] of revelation
[1:01:34] where god is speaking and um
[1:01:37] he's showing us amen that there is
[1:01:40] a book that has been opened
[1:01:44] and you and i understand that the book
[1:01:46] for
[1:01:47] hundreds of years was sealed
[1:01:51] so much so in the old testament they
[1:01:53] were asked men were asked to
[1:01:55] read it intelligent men uh men who
[1:01:59] uh are dumb men whatever nobody could
[1:02:03] read it
[1:02:03] or even understand it because the book
[1:02:06] was sealed
[1:02:07] and even you you've heard me say just on
[1:02:10] the other day about the bread
[1:02:12] you know the bread of which is jesus
[1:02:15] said i
[1:02:15] am the bread of life and we understand
[1:02:19] without the anointing
[1:02:21] uh you can't understand the bread
[1:02:26] you can't understand this book y'all
[1:02:28] understand that
[1:02:29] and so we understand that the bible or
[1:02:32] that
[1:02:32] shoe bread in the uh uh outer court
[1:02:36] uh let me put his way in the in the holy
[1:02:39] place
[1:02:40] so you understand uh uh it represents
[1:02:43] this bible the bread
[1:02:45] uh but sometimes uh people want to take
[1:02:48] the shoe bread
[1:02:50] and put it into the holies of holies
[1:02:53] uh but but you can't take the shoe bread
[1:02:56] and put it in the holies of holies
[1:02:58] because the holies of holies
[1:03:01] consisted of manna
[1:03:06] and that manner was in a a golden sensor
[1:03:10] type of vessel showing that the vessel
[1:03:12] that the manner in itself was
[1:03:14] deity now isn't amazing
[1:03:17] but still because not only was it god
[1:03:20] jesus said i
[1:03:21] am that bread but he also said i am that
[1:03:24] manner
[1:03:24] or that bread that fell in the
[1:03:28] wilderness so we understand by god's
[1:03:30] grace
[1:03:31] amen that bread that laid there on that
[1:03:35] that table there in in the holy place
[1:03:41] laid the top as i said the other day was
[1:03:43] was gold which represented deity
[1:03:45] uh uh something happens
[1:03:49] a change of some sort happens when you
[1:03:53] that same bread it doesn't change
[1:03:56] one bread was made on the earth and the
[1:03:58] other bread was made in heaven
[1:04:01] and that manner amen that comes
[1:04:04] down from heaven is now preserved
[1:04:08] there in the holies of holies and that's
[1:04:12] what we're talking about because
[1:04:13] remember
[1:04:14] as long as the veil was there nobody
[1:04:18] could really
[1:04:18] identify god
[1:04:22] like israel israel thought that god was
[1:04:26] in a box and you've heard us say that
[1:04:28] you can't
[1:04:29] just put god in a box
[1:04:32] god was beyond the ark that was in the
[1:04:36] what we call uh with moses and and
[1:04:40] joshua that was just a replica
[1:04:44] something symbolic to let them know that
[1:04:47] he was with them
[1:04:49] but god was way beyond that
[1:04:53] y'all understand me god was way beyond
[1:04:56] that because
[1:04:57] amen he was with them even when the ark
[1:04:59] wasn't with them
[1:05:02] you understand me so you and i must
[1:05:04] understand amen
[1:05:06] we must have a revelation
[1:05:09] of who god is you know god is the kind
[1:05:13] of a person
[1:05:14] you can worship him under a tree
[1:05:18] you can worship him sitting on a rock
[1:05:21] you can worship him in the desert
[1:05:25] wherever you are you can worship god
[1:05:29] and understand when we talk about
[1:05:30] worship we're not talking about just
[1:05:32] singing praises
[1:05:35] because worship involves more than just
[1:05:37] singing praises
[1:05:39] we think sometimes because of the music
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:42] and all of that and all that's good
[1:05:43] don't get me wrong
[1:05:45] but worship also includes
[1:05:49] reading the word whoo
[1:05:53] hello because amen you've got to
[1:05:56] understand and i'm kind of jumping a
[1:05:58] little bit
[1:05:59] but jesus met a woman at the well
[1:06:02] and he told this woman certain things
[1:06:04] about her life
[1:06:06] but he proceeded on to say that the
[1:06:09] father is
[1:06:10] looking for those who would worship me
[1:06:14] in spirit and in truth
[1:06:17] hallelujah where everybody says oh they
[1:06:20] got the holy ghost and
[1:06:21] worshiping in spirit is wonderful but
[1:06:24] the only way you can worship in truth
[1:06:27] is by the word
[1:06:30] hello because the word is truth
[1:06:34] hallelujah and so this is where things
[1:06:37] become
[1:06:38] can become unbalanced because christians
[1:06:42] say
[1:06:42] i love god and yet
[1:06:46] they won't read their word
[1:06:49] so when you don't read your word you
[1:06:52] come
[1:06:52] short of worshiping god in truth
[1:06:57] you can come in here and you can shout
[1:06:59] you can dance
[1:07:01] you can do all the religious things
[1:07:04] but when you don't read your word
[1:07:08] you don't study your word you don't
[1:07:11] meditate on your word
[1:07:14] you are leaving the truth part out of it
[1:07:17] so therefore your worship is in vain
[1:07:24] hello god says worship
[1:07:28] me in spirit and
[1:07:31] in truth hallelujah
[1:07:35] you understand what i'm saying because
[1:07:37] when we're here
[1:07:39] by god's grace what makes us different
[1:07:42] than what we call the pentecostals
[1:07:46] their anointing is the same anointing
[1:07:49] they're spirit
[1:07:51] hallelujah but what makes them
[1:07:54] air is because they failed to
[1:07:57] follow the word
[1:08:00] you understand me because when luther
[1:08:04] came
[1:08:04] he was the word expressed
[1:08:08] he preached the revelation of his day
[1:08:11] and in that small portion he had truth
[1:08:14] and he had spirit the portion that was
[1:08:18] allotted to him
[1:08:20] hallelujah but when wesley came
[1:08:23] he could no longer continue in luther's
[1:08:26] message
[1:08:28] because luther's message was for the
[1:08:30] lutheran in that day
[1:08:32] but he had to take what luther had
[1:08:37] and add to what god had given him
[1:08:40] which was sanctification so you can't
[1:08:43] even worship god in spirit and truth
[1:08:45] without justification and sanctification
[1:08:48] it don't stop there it doesn't stop
[1:08:52] there
[1:08:53] it went on to the pentecostals right
[1:08:56] and so we say okay uh uh we we're gonna
[1:09:00] worship
[1:09:00] in other words what i'm trying to say
[1:09:02] every church age
[1:09:04] messenger in order for him to be a true
[1:09:06] messenger
[1:09:07] had to bring something different from
[1:09:09] the old
[1:09:12] hello he you know wesley could not just
[1:09:16] preach
[1:09:17] luther's message and be truth
[1:09:21] he had to preach what god remember this
[1:09:23] is a restoration
[1:09:25] this is a restoring of the word and so
[1:09:28] you have to follow the pill of fire
[1:09:30] wherever he moves let me hurry up
[1:09:35] so we find out the pentecostals we
[1:09:37] preached it you know
[1:09:38] and and then we we we thought it we
[1:09:40] didn't know
[1:09:42] but we found out by god's grace amen
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:45] that there was more than just jumping
[1:09:48] and shouting and speaking in tongues
[1:09:51] now the spirit of god caused those
[1:09:53] things to happen
[1:09:54] but that wasn't the fullness of the word
[1:09:58] then god had to send a messenger in our
[1:10:01] day
[1:10:02] with a different message than pentecost
[1:10:06] he had to take us from the outer core i
[1:10:08] mean the holy place
[1:10:10] hello y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:10:13] see you can worship god in your
[1:10:15] your spirit but god wants truth
[1:10:23] in the holy place as i said you had the
[1:10:26] seven golden candlesticks
[1:10:29] you had the table of shoe bread you had
[1:10:31] all of those
[1:10:32] things and and they worshiped god in
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:36] place that was good for them
[1:10:40] but now god is calling us up higher he's
[1:10:44] calling for us to worship him
[1:10:46] in a place that no other age
[1:10:49] has worshipped him in
[1:10:53] you understand me because the message in
[1:10:55] which they received in pentecost
[1:10:57] from for the most part i'm not talking
[1:10:59] about election now
[1:11:01] i said for the most part that anointing
[1:11:03] struck their spirit
[1:11:06] that's why you could have people amen
[1:11:08] that could shout and dance
[1:11:10] and curse like sailors
[1:11:13] huh that's why you have people a man who
[1:11:16] can preach like angels
[1:11:18] and commit adultery
[1:11:22] hallelujah because they did not have the
[1:11:24] word
[1:11:25] that could take them beyond the veil
[1:11:31] see this is not just a message we're not
[1:11:34] here just to
[1:11:35] quote things hallelujah but
[1:11:38] god has called us the bride of jesus
[1:11:40] christ to
[1:11:41] live it and every age
[1:11:45] lived the life and
[1:11:48] or the message that was preached to them
[1:11:52] hallelujah y'all understand me and
[1:11:55] each messenger it means like luther
[1:11:58] that that bible that word that says
[1:12:01] to just shall live by faith you know
[1:12:04] what that was
[1:12:06] that was a rock
[1:12:09] that was their revelation and nobody
[1:12:13] could take that
[1:12:14] from them y'all understand what i'm
[1:12:17] saying
[1:12:18] we who have been baptized in the name of
[1:12:20] the lord jesus christ
[1:12:21] what preacher what politician
[1:12:25] what pope can take that from you
[1:12:29] it is a revelation it's not
[1:12:32] something that you got in your head it's
[1:12:34] something that's in your heart
[1:12:37] but this message doesn't just allows you
[1:12:41] to
[1:12:41] remain there like i said the other day
[1:12:44] in the seven church ages because the
[1:12:46] seven church ages
[1:12:47] was based upon rules and laws and
[1:12:50] regulations
[1:12:52] remember even in the wesleyan age
[1:12:55] amen women couldn't even wear any
[1:12:57] jewelry
[1:12:59] because that's what they styled as
[1:13:01] sanctification
[1:13:03] look at us now we realize amen that
[1:13:07] that revelation as it were amen was good
[1:13:11] but we understood that god goes beyond
[1:13:14] the outward appearance
[1:13:16] and he looks at the heart you understand
[1:13:20] me
[1:13:21] i'm talking about god is my rock he's
[1:13:24] my revelation and he has come in this
[1:13:27] last day
[1:13:28] amen to show us who we are
[1:13:32] and what we came for
[1:13:35] here when like i said it was
[1:13:39] a changing of the message and that's
[1:13:42] what i try to tell people i'm not saying
[1:13:44] that if you you you know how many y'all
[1:13:46] know this
[1:13:47] see in in the in the in the uh holy
[1:13:50] place
[1:13:51] there were laws you know the
[1:13:53] candlesticks you know the shoe bread
[1:13:56] there were ceremonial things that you
[1:13:58] you did there
[1:14:00] and um you know like we do here
[1:14:03] like we do everywhere uh you know people
[1:14:05] think well
[1:14:06] it's my church it ain't your church
[1:14:12] this building is not holy unless the
[1:14:15] holy god is in it
[1:14:18] i could worship god anywhere and you you
[1:14:21] don't understand
[1:14:23] god he did god didn't die on the cross
[1:14:26] for this building
[1:14:29] god died on the cross for your building
[1:14:33] and the bible said ye are the temple of
[1:14:35] god
[1:14:37] you understand me see the the danger of
[1:14:40] this whole thing is
[1:14:42] you can be like the pharisees like i
[1:14:44] mentioned yes
[1:14:45] friday and you can do all the
[1:14:48] ritualistic
[1:14:49] things those things that look pleasant
[1:14:51] and pleasing to the eyes of
[1:14:52] men but when jesus came and he
[1:14:56] judged what the he was seeing
[1:14:59] he said i wouldn't let you look like
[1:15:00] white as supplica
[1:15:02] but inwardly you're dead men's bones
[1:15:05] now the reason why he said those things
[1:15:08] because jesus was not ignorant to the
[1:15:10] fact that the ark of the covenant was no
[1:15:13] longer there
[1:15:15] that's right when israel went into
[1:15:17] babylon the ark of the covenant was
[1:15:19] taken away
[1:15:21] so all of those hundreds of years they
[1:15:24] had
[1:15:24] church they had singers they had
[1:15:28] music they had all of those things
[1:15:31] and that whole religious act was a fake
[1:15:37] somebody help me here see that's why
[1:15:39] it's important
[1:15:40] that you have the holy ghost
[1:15:44] in your soul not just on your flesh not
[1:15:48] just on your spirit
[1:15:49] but in there where he makes you
[1:15:53] change when you got the holy ghost
[1:15:57] you don't have to practice righteousness
[1:16:00] righteousness is a part of the fruit
[1:16:03] it is something that the tree bears
[1:16:06] oh god help me
[1:16:09] you talking about a breaking of a new
[1:16:11] day we're talking about making a rapture
[1:16:13] and only those amen who have been born
[1:16:16] again truly born again
[1:16:17] amen got god on in on the inside god
[1:16:20] sitting on the throne of your heart
[1:16:22] you are the ones
[1:16:25] hello y'all don't remember let me tell
[1:16:28] y'all something i don't know how they
[1:16:29] did it at your
[1:16:30] church but at my church the one the
[1:16:33] apostolic church i went to
[1:16:35] they didn't care about you being
[1:16:36] sanctified
[1:16:39] you know what they wanted to hear you
[1:16:41] speak in tongues
[1:16:45] take you right off the street baptize
[1:16:47] you
[1:16:48] and take you into the tarrying room
[1:16:50] until you don't set jesus fast enough
[1:16:55] to your tongue status and you say oh you
[1:16:58] got it
[1:16:59] and they sang people go right out
[1:17:02] drinking
[1:17:03] smoking dancing why
[1:17:07] because they missed a step
[1:17:10] they missed the step of sanctification
[1:17:14] oh y'all looking at me like i'm crazy
[1:17:16] but that's what happens to a lot of the
[1:17:18] message people
[1:17:20] you come right into the message you
[1:17:22] understand some revelation and all of a
[1:17:24] sudden you got it
[1:17:26] oh you've got to be born again
[1:17:30] that's one sp aspect of the word that
[1:17:33] will never change
[1:17:35] and this is why i keep preaching to my
[1:17:37] own church
[1:17:38] we're not here amen to conform to a
[1:17:41] system
[1:17:42] that man has laid out here under the
[1:17:45] umbrella of the message we're here to
[1:17:48] know the messenger
[1:17:50] and i'm not talking about william
[1:17:52] branham i'm talking about jesus christ
[1:17:58] help me somebody
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:02] we're living in a time where it's urgent
[1:18:05] people need to examine themselves like
[1:18:07] the bible says
[1:18:08] to see whether they be in the faith
[1:18:13] help us jesus it is grace
[1:18:21] but because we have grace many people
[1:18:22] have made it a
[1:18:24] disgrace
[1:18:30] they were called christians at antioch
[1:18:33] because they act like christ they walk
[1:18:36] like christ
[1:18:37] they talk like christ jesus christ was
[1:18:40] always the message
[1:18:42] y'all hear me so what are you saying
[1:18:45] brother brooks are you
[1:18:46] moving no no no no no there was a time
[1:18:50] when jesus walked the earth right
[1:18:54] and they said come see a man
[1:18:58] hello but when
[1:19:01] jesus died and rose again
[1:19:05] it became the gospel of jesus christ
[1:19:09] the death burial and resurrection of
[1:19:11] jesus christ
[1:19:14] never from that point on did they say
[1:19:16] come see a man
[1:19:20] y'all hear what i'm saying i want you to
[1:19:22] understand that
[1:19:24] when when the prophet of god was here on
[1:19:26] the scene he
[1:19:27] always directed us to jesus christ
[1:19:32] and if you don't know who you serve you
[1:19:34] are blind still yet
[1:19:37] worship is something else you know
[1:19:39] worship means to prostrate
[1:19:42] about yourself but you know what we're
[1:19:45] doing
[1:19:46] we find ourselves bowing ourselves to
[1:19:48] our phones and our ipads
[1:19:52] hello and you don't even know the devil
[1:19:54] is tricking you
[1:19:56] and we find ourselves humbling ourselves
[1:19:59] is that right oh it's true jesus tried
[1:20:03] to connect with
[1:20:04] us and we'll say later let the phone
[1:20:06] beep
[1:20:09] gotta get it gotta answer it i ain't
[1:20:12] gonna preach on that y'all y'all looking
[1:20:13] at me like i'm crazy
[1:20:15] but the point is amen it must be this
[1:20:18] bible this word must become a revelation
[1:20:22] hallelujah i believe and i'm going to
[1:20:24] say it like this i was i'm working on a
[1:20:26] message
[1:20:27] from joshua the judges because remember
[1:20:30] one of the things that god told joshua
[1:20:32] he said moses is dead
[1:20:35] now if you say that in the message they
[1:20:37] say oh wait a minute brother
[1:20:38] is not dead no not in the way that god
[1:20:41] is saying
[1:20:42] the way god is saying he is
[1:20:46] he said bring that to the scripture
[1:20:49] jesus
[1:20:49] before he resurrect resurrected lazarus
[1:20:53] he said lazarus is asleep
[1:20:56] and his disciples says let's go wake him
[1:20:59] not understanding what jesus was saying
[1:21:03] then jesus had to bring it down to their
[1:21:05] term lazarus is dead
[1:21:10] because we know by god's grace that the
[1:21:13] message of those who are truly
[1:21:15] christians
[1:21:15] we never die we never we we sleep in
[1:21:19] christ
[1:21:20] but there are turns and there are times
[1:21:22] we must recognize the
[1:21:24] ending of a ministry
[1:21:28] and the beginning of something new so
[1:21:31] you say what do you mean brother brooks
[1:21:33] when the prophet of god went off the
[1:21:35] scene the holy spirit that was in him
[1:21:38] did not stop the ministry
[1:21:41] the ministry never stopped this is why
[1:21:44] the prophet god said the move is on
[1:21:46] for the bride wait a minute here
[1:21:51] what are you saying brother brooks there
[1:21:53] is a message
[1:21:56] do you mind if i take my jacket off now
[1:21:58] it's getting like the way i feel it
[1:22:01] i like feeling a little warm
[1:22:04] but the truth of the matter is the truth
[1:22:07] of the matter is
[1:22:09] amen he was saying i must decrease and
[1:22:11] he must increase
[1:22:13] now watch this because god told joshua
[1:22:17] and this is what i want you to
[1:22:18] understand don't you get away from the
[1:22:20] things that moses taught you
[1:22:24] i thought i'd get a bigger amen
[1:22:29] in other words in order to continue the
[1:22:32] ministry of joshua
[1:22:33] joshua had to be reminded of everything
[1:22:36] moses said
[1:22:37] he couldn't bear one eye order off of it
[1:22:40] he had to stay
[1:22:42] with that message but you see in moses
[1:22:46] day
[1:22:47] hallelujah in moses day
[1:22:51] the people were lazy dollatory
[1:22:55] and the whole time moses was trying to
[1:22:57] show them that they had the supernatural
[1:22:59] working with them too
[1:23:03] but you see everybody went down to
[1:23:05] jeffersonville just to see moses
[1:23:08] so that he could do the miracles and he
[1:23:11] says no i'm not the only one
[1:23:13] your pastor has the power by the word of
[1:23:17] god to lay hands on the sick and they
[1:23:19] shall recover
[1:23:20] and the difference between moses
[1:23:22] ministry and joshua's ministry
[1:23:25] because when joshua came on the scene it
[1:23:27] was no longer a one-man ministry
[1:23:30] joshua said get everybody that's mature
[1:23:34] and we're gonna walk around jericho
[1:23:39] he involved everybody in the
[1:23:42] supernatural
[1:23:43] so is the spirit of god joshua jesus
[1:23:46] christ himself
[1:23:48] involving the whole body
[1:23:51] oh come on somebody
[1:23:55] a revelation you must understand
[1:23:58] in order for you to truly worship god it
[1:24:00] doesn't mean
[1:24:01] that you come to church and sit in your
[1:24:03] pews and do nothing
[1:24:05] everybody every piece of the body has a
[1:24:08] function
[1:24:10] i'm so tired of this nicholas appearance
[1:24:13] you know what i'm saying preacher come
[1:24:15] up and the people don't do nothing amen
[1:24:17] sometimes
[1:24:19] right and you say you're worshiping god
[1:24:21] and you're looking listen
[1:24:23] you can't even worship god here you
[1:24:25] understand what i'm saying
[1:24:26] with me from one building to another
[1:24:28] something changed
[1:24:30] but it ain't the building
[1:24:34] that building has done nothing for you
[1:24:37] it's your attitude it was your worship
[1:24:40] that made that building there oh come on
[1:24:43] somebody
[1:24:44] and if you take that same worship and
[1:24:47] bring it over here
[1:24:49] you would have the same effects don't
[1:24:52] blame it on the building
[1:24:54] you're the problem
[1:24:58] worship is worship it doesn't matter
[1:25:01] where you are to worship
[1:25:03] hallelujah you can worship in your
[1:25:05] bedroom you can worship in your kitchen
[1:25:07] you can worship wherever you are on the
[1:25:09] street
[1:25:10] this is why god said he's looking for
[1:25:13] those
[1:25:15] who would worship him in spirit and in
[1:25:17] truth
[1:25:18] that woman didn't say well i better stay
[1:25:19] here at the well and so i could worship
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:22] no sir when the truth struck her she ran
[1:25:25] to the city
[1:25:26] and said come see a man what was he
[1:25:28] doing she was worshiping
[1:25:33] oh god help us lord see we i'm so you
[1:25:36] know it just
[1:25:37] it's really sickening when we see amen
[1:25:40] how we have allowed
[1:25:41] a system to form us to something that is
[1:25:44] not
[1:25:48] this is not a collective revelation it's
[1:25:51] an individual
[1:25:53] y'all better hear what i'm saying we
[1:25:56] come here to hear the word we come here
[1:25:57] to say amen
[1:25:58] we come to uh you know be a witness to
[1:26:01] the word of this day
[1:26:03] and you say oh i'm in the message and
[1:26:06] you don't even read the open book
[1:26:09] you don't read the message for the day
[1:26:11] oh i need to
[1:26:12] you know i can't i can't discern which
[1:26:14] way to read whether i read the bible
[1:26:16] read the books or listen to the table
[1:26:19] folks you do them both
[1:26:22] you take a tape and you take your bible
[1:26:25] amen
[1:26:26] that's how you do it you don't make a
[1:26:30] sandwich normally out of one piece of
[1:26:34] bread
[1:26:39] what that's the truth when you read and
[1:26:41] study your bible that is worship
[1:26:45] why because when you hear the word you
[1:26:46] bow to it
[1:26:48] yes lord that's me how many times you
[1:26:50] read your bible and get excited because
[1:26:52] the bible speaks
[1:26:55] hallelujah what is it that is that a
[1:26:57] shekinah glory that is that anointing
[1:26:59] that is anointing that word
[1:27:01] feeding you and if the bible will do
[1:27:05] that so does the tapes
[1:27:07] oh somebody help me here
[1:27:12] god is real and when you understand what
[1:27:15] has taken place in this day
[1:27:18] hallelujah come out of her my people and
[1:27:21] be not partakers of her sin
[1:27:23] now we've done that but it's not just
[1:27:25] coming out
[1:27:26] you got to go into and look at all the
[1:27:29] people that came out of
[1:27:31] egypt that died following the prophet
[1:27:35] hallelujah you know why they were never
[1:27:37] able to humble themselves to the word
[1:27:41] hallelujah oh moses you think you're the
[1:27:43] only one
[1:27:45] long he was
[1:27:50] that's where the message came from
[1:27:54] that was god's choosing that was god's
[1:27:56] provided way
[1:27:59] and it was so important that god told
[1:28:02] joshua
[1:28:02] don't you forget what moses said why
[1:28:06] because moses is dead moses ministry has
[1:28:10] stopped
[1:28:11] but the word that moses preached was god
[1:28:16] am i making sense yes sir
[1:28:20] i'm going to say another thing we're
[1:28:23] different
[1:28:25] we have come out of systems of laws
[1:28:29] there's only one law left and that is
[1:28:32] the law of love
[1:28:35] and the bible said if you love me you'll
[1:28:38] keep my commandments
[1:28:40] so now he's bringing you out of uh uh uh
[1:28:42] the the bondage
[1:28:45] because i don't know whether you know it
[1:28:46] or not but the church i was in was a
[1:28:48] church of bondage
[1:28:51] and they had us so regulated we couldn't
[1:28:54] even visit other churches without
[1:28:55] telling
[1:28:56] the preacher the bishop or whoever where
[1:28:58] we were going we had to get permission
[1:29:01] even if it was in the same organization
[1:29:05] anybody know what i'm talking about i
[1:29:07] hope this is all right pastor but i
[1:29:08] i've got to preach what he wants me to
[1:29:10] preach because i haven't i'm trying my
[1:29:11] best to hurry and i'm not doing that
[1:29:13] but my point is let me move on you and i
[1:29:16] must
[1:29:16] understand we are in a law of love love
[1:29:19] is the only thing that god is looking
[1:29:21] for
[1:29:22] hello why because love never failing
[1:29:28] love was the thing that satan broke with
[1:29:30] eve
[1:29:32] hallelujah and they were kicked out of
[1:29:35] the garden because they
[1:29:36] reasoned where they fail to worship god
[1:29:40] listen when you reason
[1:29:41] is that the truth the bible says
[1:29:44] whosoever you yield your members to obey
[1:29:47] though that is the one you're worshiping
[1:29:50] hello so if you yield to the devil you
[1:29:53] becomes a worshipper of his
[1:29:56] whoo somebody help me here but if you
[1:29:58] stay within the shekinah
[1:30:01] you don't have to worry about that
[1:30:04] hallelujah why because in this
[1:30:06] kind of glory there is a covenant
[1:30:09] an unconditional covenant
[1:30:12] that no matter what you do you are
[1:30:15] covered
[1:30:17] and everybody ain't there he said don't
[1:30:20] look at yourself
[1:30:22] look at your sacrifice god don't look at
[1:30:25] you
[1:30:25] he looks at your sacrifice which is
[1:30:28] christ
[1:30:29] don't look at yourself i'm not worthy
[1:30:31] you're not worthy
[1:30:32] nobody's worthy but he is the one
[1:30:36] and i'm not counting on what i've done
[1:30:38] what i am
[1:30:39] never make it i'll never make it but i'm
[1:30:42] looking to what he's done
[1:30:44] there's where i'm trusting what he's
[1:30:47] done he's my
[1:30:48] sacrifice i'm not worthy of healing no
[1:30:51] sir lord
[1:30:52] i ought to have died long ago
[1:30:55] oh my i've never ever been born but i
[1:30:58] live
[1:30:59] i've got eternal life i'm going to
[1:31:01] heaven why
[1:31:02] because he done it for me hello
[1:31:05] see that's the problem that's why you
[1:31:07] can't come to church
[1:31:09] and really enjoy jesus because you come
[1:31:12] in here with these burdens
[1:31:15] lord look what i've done the devil said
[1:31:17] you ain't worthy
[1:31:19] you used to you ought to when he
[1:31:20] preached that to you you say amen
[1:31:23] you'll never be worthy but i take my
[1:31:26] lamb i take my sacrifice
[1:31:29] and because of my lamb because of my
[1:31:31] sacrifice
[1:31:32] i have been made worthy he became my sin
[1:31:36] that i might become the righteousness of
[1:31:38] god hallelujah
[1:31:40] so i'm free because he whom the son is
[1:31:44] set free
[1:31:45] is free indeed hallelujah
[1:31:48] oh people come in church and they're so
[1:31:50] worthy it feels so unworthy they can't
[1:31:52] worship
[1:31:53] that's a trick of the devil because he
[1:31:56] knows when you come in like that
[1:31:57] you're breaking the word into his gate
[1:32:00] with thanksgiving
[1:32:02] into his course with praise that's how
[1:32:04] you come in
[1:32:06] and when you come in with your head hung
[1:32:08] down amen the devil knows you're
[1:32:10] breaking the word
[1:32:11] and nine times out of ten you're not
[1:32:13] going to get from god
[1:32:14] what you deserve or what you need
[1:32:20] look at that woman amen
[1:32:24] who came in to see jesus in simon's
[1:32:26] house she was unworthy
[1:32:28] but she was standing right there at the
[1:32:30] ark of the covenant
[1:32:32] there was the mercy seat in human flesh
[1:32:36] hallelujah hallelujah she began to wash
[1:32:39] her she began to cry
[1:32:40] she took a little oil of alabasa and she
[1:32:42] broke it and she began to wash his feet
[1:32:44] and why oh my god can't you see the
[1:32:46] scene
[1:32:47] that's the way this message should
[1:32:49] affect you i've come into the presence
[1:32:52] of god hallelujah
[1:32:53] i come in unworthy maybe so but listen i
[1:32:56] will not leave out this way
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:32:59] hallelujah there are times amen you come
[1:33:02] in but when you come in
[1:33:04] with your head down you should go out
[1:33:06] with your head up hallelujah
[1:33:09] somehow church is that right if we
[1:33:11] produce the right atmosphere
[1:33:13] that's your kind of comes down and it
[1:33:16] annoys
[1:33:16] every one of us so much so if you come
[1:33:19] in dead
[1:33:20] you go out alive
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:24] it breaks the chains it destroys the
[1:33:27] works of the enemy
[1:33:28] hallelujah it changed your night in
[1:33:30] today
[1:33:32] oh come on somebody it rolls away the
[1:33:35] clouds
[1:33:36] and bring forth the sons of god
[1:33:38] hallelujah
[1:33:39] oh glory that's what this message came
[1:33:43] to do
[1:33:44] we supposed to be the happiest people on
[1:33:46] the face of the earth
[1:33:54] getting along with each other let me
[1:33:56] tell you something you got enough wine
[1:33:58] in you
[1:33:58] you get enough stimulation hallelujah
[1:34:01] you'll be hugging the chair telling the
[1:34:02] chair how much you love him
[1:34:06] huh you get enough oil in you right
[1:34:09] drunk people when they drop oh i just
[1:34:11] love you say get away from me
[1:34:13] hallelujah i don't want that anointing
[1:34:15] hallelujah but if you got some fire
[1:34:18] really lay your head on me hallelujah
[1:34:21] y'all see what i'm saying if you got
[1:34:23] fire lay your hands on me
[1:34:25] catch me a fire
[1:34:31] like i was saying when brother simmons
[1:34:33] prayed for me uh
[1:34:34] friday i could feel the fire of god just
[1:34:37] go through me like that
[1:34:39] hallelujah y'all understand me we ought
[1:34:42] to have a little virtue of something
[1:34:44] that if we lay hands it may not happen
[1:34:46] all the time but
[1:34:47] sometime at least sometimes
[1:34:51] hallelujah we ought to have something we
[1:34:53] can give a brother and a sister
[1:34:55] by way of a handshake or a hug y'all
[1:34:57] know what i'm saying
[1:34:59] hallelujah something brother sumter said
[1:35:03] at his wife's funeral he said it became
[1:35:06] a revelation
[1:35:07] that he had god living in his house
[1:35:11] say the say it was say it was veil
[1:35:15] hallelujah but now that the veil is gone
[1:35:17] he see that he
[1:35:18] he had god what was it
[1:35:22] not not mary the flesh but god in mary
[1:35:27] living the life of a virtuous woman
[1:35:30] that's god in you you cannot do it folks
[1:35:34] i can't do it but when god is on the
[1:35:37] inside
[1:35:38] and that anointing strikes the word
[1:35:41] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:35:43] let's go let's say it like this william
[1:35:45] branham
[1:35:46] could be no great of a prophet if the
[1:35:48] anointing hadn't struck him
[1:35:50] if he was not the word for the day and
[1:35:52] the hour he would have
[1:35:54] never been able to do what he did but
[1:35:56] because he was the word
[1:35:59] god was all obligated to anoint the word
[1:36:03] in him for our day
[1:36:06] amen y'all believe that well what about
[1:36:09] the bride
[1:36:10] of jesus if you are the bride
[1:36:13] then god is obligated to anoint that
[1:36:17] seed in you
[1:36:18] to produce the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:22] not by power not by might
[1:36:25] but by my spirit said the lord you
[1:36:28] understand me
[1:36:30] hallelujah god is so real to us
[1:36:33] he said it's a wonderful to serve the
[1:36:35] lord and no

[1:37:01] days nobody didn't tell me no brother

[1:37:10] right now in the message still having an
[1:37:12] evening service on sundays
[1:37:14] but you can feel it some of the things
[1:37:17] like

[1:37:21] not
[1:37:22] have service
[1:37:27] but i might have it till jesus tell me
[1:37:29] otherwise
[1:37:30] hallelujah y'all understand me amen i
[1:37:34] just can't go about their influence i
[1:37:36] must go if i'm the only one in that
[1:37:38] place
[1:37:39] in the evening i'm going to be there
[1:37:41] sometime i get there they're only about
[1:37:42] two or three of us
[1:37:44] and we're online and everybody think we
[1:37:46] had a church full
[1:37:50] hallelujah but one thing i was saying
[1:37:52] like this by god's grace
[1:37:54] the bible knew it was going to be this
[1:37:56] way because say where two or three are
[1:37:58] gathered in my name
[1:37:59] i'll be there in the midst so we steal
[1:38:02] scripture
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:09] hallelujah and i'm telling you you know
[1:38:12] most of the time when you ain't got many
[1:38:14] oh my god he comes on the scene
[1:38:20] no resistance all the resistors stayed
[1:38:23] home
[1:38:28] free preaching y'all know what i'm
[1:38:30] saying she kind of comes down and we go
[1:38:33] up and all we can do is tell them y'all
[1:38:36] missed it but you see when they do come
[1:38:38] they stifle
[1:38:40] so sometimes you don't tell them nothing
[1:38:44] let them keep doing what they got to do
[1:38:46] y'all got quiet on that one
[1:38:48] but it's the truth it's the truth let me
[1:38:50] move on by god's grace
[1:38:51] now we realize amen god
[1:38:55] let me read this psalms 56 thou telleth
[1:38:58] my wonderings put thou my tears in thy
[1:39:02] bottle
[1:39:03] are they not in thy book when i cry unto
[1:39:07] thee
[1:39:07] then shall my enemies back
[1:39:10] turn back this i know for god is for me
[1:39:14] let me tell y'all something there is a
[1:39:16] time and my name has always been
[1:39:18] in the land book of life but let me tell
[1:39:20] you something
[1:39:21] there's a time that i was in the book of
[1:39:23] life
[1:39:25] because there was no blood i didn't know
[1:39:28] the lamb
[1:39:30] i didn't have the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:39:33] but when your name is in the lamb's book
[1:39:36] of life
[1:39:36] that revelation comes to you you are
[1:39:39] justified as though you never sin in the
[1:39:41] first place
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:47] hallelujah see that's the difference
[1:39:49] between the foolish virgin and the wise
[1:39:51] the foolish virgin stayed in the in the
[1:39:54] the holy place they were sanctified
[1:39:58] they did everything right but they
[1:40:00] failed to go beyond the veil
[1:40:02] somebody help me here see and you can't
[1:40:06] have
[1:40:06] you came i tried to tell people i said
[1:40:09] understand you didn't hear the bells
[1:40:12] in the holy place
[1:40:16] you didn't hear the cry holy holy holy
[1:40:19] holy holy holy you you heard that
[1:40:22] behind the curtain that's where holiness
[1:40:25] is holiness is not your apparel
[1:40:28] holiness is when the holy god sits on
[1:40:31] your throne
[1:40:32] in your heart
[1:40:36] oh it's true
[1:40:39] because we've been taught and been
[1:40:41] dressed holy
[1:40:44] and that's right but it should be the
[1:40:47] end with man
[1:40:49] that holy ghost man that revealed to you
[1:40:53] that dressing holy is right and when you
[1:40:56] when you're influenced by the shekinah
[1:40:59] it's never a burden um
[1:41:04] i hope you're enjoying this because i am
[1:41:08] hallelujah in god will i praise this
[1:41:11] word
[1:41:12] in the lord will i praise this word that
[1:41:15] is worship oh my
[1:41:19] what time did we start hallelujah
[1:41:22] god is so good is that right listen i'm
[1:41:25] going to praise this word how many of us
[1:41:26] know enough scripture to praise him by
[1:41:29] his word
[1:41:32] some of us don't even know saint john 3
[1:41:34] 16.
[1:41:40] but i love his word you understand me
[1:41:44] it's more to worship than just
[1:41:48] the outward appearance god is looking
[1:41:50] for the heart
[1:41:51] is that right because the pharisees and
[1:41:53] the sadducees
[1:41:54] did not have god in his in their hearts
[1:41:57] and that's why god said
[1:41:58] you oh your worship is worshiping in me
[1:42:01] in vain
[1:42:02] you do all the rituals but i need your
[1:42:04] heart
[1:42:05] i'm not i'm not looking for a samson
[1:42:07] strength
[1:42:08] i'm looking for a conversion i'm looking
[1:42:10] for somebody who's been converted
[1:42:12] and i'm there with them oh help me jesus
[1:42:16] let me move on
[1:42:17] thou vows are upon me o god i will
[1:42:20] render praises unto thee
[1:42:22] don't you understand
[1:42:25] how can you praise god if you don't know
[1:42:26] him
[1:42:30] the way we praise god proves sometimes
[1:42:32] we don't know him like we think we do
[1:42:35] in all things give thanks
[1:42:39] hallelujah we should always be praising
[1:42:42] god even in the midst of our trials
[1:42:44] in the midst of our trial hey somebody
[1:42:46] help me here
[1:42:47] the lights only went out amen in
[1:42:51] the potential in the holy place but
[1:42:54] there is a kind of glory
[1:42:56] it never went out because it wasn't a
[1:42:59] man-made light
[1:43:01] hallelujah and when god let me tell you
[1:43:03] something i have gone through a lot of
[1:43:05] trials and a lot of temptations
[1:43:07] and a lot of failures but there's a
[1:43:09] place in my heart
[1:43:11] that satan can never put out
[1:43:14] hallelujah listen i don't ever worry
[1:43:16] about going to heaven
[1:43:18] i know heaven been made for me and i've
[1:43:20] been made for heaven hallelujah
[1:43:22] oh my god i realize amen that i don't
[1:43:26] have to worry
[1:43:27] about making a rapture because i'm in it
[1:43:29] already
[1:43:33] hallelujah i'm trying to quit listen the
[1:43:37] bible says but the people that walk in
[1:43:39] darkness have seen a great light
[1:43:41] i haven't even got where i wanted to go
[1:43:42] i'm sorry they that dwell in the land of
[1:43:45] the shadows of death
[1:43:46] upon them have the light shine and i
[1:43:49] used to worry about
[1:43:50] not word be concerned what is that light
[1:43:53] do you think he's talking about a light
[1:43:54] like that
[1:43:55] there's only one light real light
[1:43:59] and that's the light of god hallelujah
[1:44:03] and the light of god shines upon you
[1:44:06] where
[1:44:07] in the holies of holies
[1:44:11] the other lights of man-made made lights
[1:44:14] hallelujah but the light in the shekinah
[1:44:18] glory
[1:44:19] is god himself hallelujah
[1:44:22] if you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:44:25] light
[1:44:26] see that's the thing as he walking and
[1:44:28] i'm not trying to strip you of your
[1:44:30] salvation
[1:44:31] what i'm trying to say if you know
[1:44:32] you've got to go farther
[1:44:34] go further don't stop
[1:44:38] don't stop until you know that he's
[1:44:41] in you see that's the greatest
[1:44:44] revelation a man or woman could ever
[1:44:45] have
[1:44:46] to know that i am in i am in him and he
[1:44:49] is in me
[1:44:53] hallelujah glory to god
[1:44:56] hallelujah when aaron went into the
[1:44:58] there in the holy place
[1:45:00] in the holies of holies a man who lived
[1:45:02] in there
[1:45:03] lived in perfection all the time the
[1:45:05] manner was fresh
[1:45:06] it didn't dry up neither did it get
[1:45:09] contaminated
[1:45:10] and if you ever get into a place where
[1:45:12] you can be
[1:45:13] so hid away in god until the outside
[1:45:16] world is dead and the veils drops over
[1:45:19] you'll see what i mean if you can
[1:45:22] then you'll see what i mean when the
[1:45:24] veil says
[1:45:26] you uh uh from the outside world was you
[1:45:30] ever so lost in christ
[1:45:32] so so pray through unto the world you
[1:45:34] had no more
[1:45:35] to do with and all you walked humbly
[1:45:38] every day before christ
[1:45:39] loving him first that's what you need
[1:45:43] them on the inside eating manna
[1:45:47] hallelujah well i don't heard that
[1:45:49] message before
[1:45:51] that attitude you never heard it
[1:45:55] you never heard it it never grows old
[1:46:00] whoa somebody help me here i'm almost
[1:46:03] done
[1:46:03] i'm almost done i'ma cut it because i i
[1:46:06] didn't know i had gone so worse
[1:46:07] so long but i understand but if
[1:46:11] if we walk and that's why we can't walk
[1:46:13] just in the seventh age the light of the
[1:46:15] seventh days we got to go further
[1:46:17] and and this is what gets me people of
[1:46:19] god and and i'm going to close
[1:46:21] you know we're supposed to come to
[1:46:23] divine love
[1:46:26] that's something you cannot mimic you
[1:46:29] can't make it up
[1:46:31] it is only something that god can give
[1:46:33] you
[1:46:35] y'all understand me divine love
[1:46:39] is never puffed up never behave
[1:46:42] yourselves unseemly
[1:46:43] divine love never seek its own
[1:46:47] huh y'all know how it is in church
[1:46:53] somebody want to be seen that ain't
[1:46:56] divine love
[1:46:58] well i gotta give well you ain't the
[1:46:59] only one
[1:47:05] and my point is we put things in places
[1:47:07] where we shouldn't
[1:47:08] and you know what you got to die and rot
[1:47:14] people none of us know how to do that
[1:47:17] but god will lead you
[1:47:19] if you ask him to he will lead you
[1:47:23] you understand me so we're coming to a
[1:47:26] place and
[1:47:27] i'm telling you in order for the life
[1:47:29] i'm talking about and the way this
[1:47:30] message is preached in order for that to
[1:47:32] come into you you've got to die
[1:47:34] and rot because nothing can live until
[1:47:37] that seed die and rot
[1:47:39] that's that's that's nature even teaches
[1:47:41] us that is that
[1:47:42] hallelujah oh it's the truth ain't
[1:47:45] nobody gonna tell me how to dress
[1:47:48] i don't even know why i went there but
[1:47:51] i'ma tell you
[1:47:52] with that attitude you still lives
[1:47:56] because if you had the holy ghost nobody
[1:47:57] will have to tell you
[1:47:59] the holy ghost will show you what is
[1:48:01] holiness
[1:48:03] hallelujah y'all understand me that's
[1:48:06] why
[1:48:06] when people be on tv or wherever they
[1:48:08] are shaking and jumping and hallelujah
[1:48:09] speaking in tongues and everything
[1:48:11] and half naked they ain't got no holy
[1:48:14] ghost
[1:48:16] maybe on the flesh maybe on the spirit a
[1:48:18] little bit
[1:48:19] you know but not in the soul oh come on
[1:48:22] somebody
[1:48:23] yeah you know like i said this is
[1:48:25] worship if it's true speak to god
[1:48:29] this is communion y'all understand that
[1:48:31] church is a place of communion
[1:48:35] when you're fellowshipping and communion
[1:48:36] with god you don't sit there let him do
[1:48:38] all the talking
[1:48:40] you know just like say like they said to
[1:48:42] brother brother one time
[1:48:43] brother why don't you say you know
[1:48:46] brother said to a brother why don't you
[1:48:47] say something he said how can i
[1:48:50] in other words you're doing all the
[1:48:52] talking how can i get a word in
[1:48:55] sometimes you almost got to be rude
[1:48:58] break on in there
[1:49:04] right fellowshipping is not just with
[1:49:06] you alone telling all your stuff
[1:49:09] it's remember i said the other day
[1:49:12] amen we're talking about sitting at the
[1:49:14] table the table is before

[1:49:19] this is where i want to bring i want to
[1:49:20] say this the other day and i forgot
[1:49:22] that's why we see what's happening
[1:49:26] we are face to face with our enemy
[1:49:29] and in that time being this is the first
[1:49:31] time where we can see the enemy coming
[1:49:34] we know it's coming we're face to face
[1:49:37] with it
[1:49:37] and even at that time he anoints us
[1:49:43] god ain't gonna let you face the enemy
[1:49:45] without him
[1:49:47] he's the one that's battling he's my
[1:49:50] battle axe
[1:49:51] he's the captain of the lord's host
[1:49:53] y'all understand me he's the one that's
[1:49:55] battling but he is that anointing
[1:49:58] amen oh come on somebody
[1:50:02] is that right i need he's a shekinah
[1:50:06] i need that anointing i need that
[1:50:09] revelation of who he is
