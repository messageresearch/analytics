hearts and speak to our needs in jesus wonderful name we pray amen the book of hebrews 13 chapter first verse god is so good he says let brotherly love continually continue not forgetful they understand entertain strangers well thereby some entertain angels unawares remember them that are in bounds as bound with them and then which suffer adversities as being yourself also in the body marriage is honorable and all in the bed under fire but whole mongols and adulterers god will judge let your conversation be without coverages and be content with such things as ye have for he has said i would never leave thee not for safety so that we may boldly say the lord is my hepar and i will not fear what man should do unto me remember them which have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow consider the end of their conversation jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god bless during his word you may be seated jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i want to talk this morning concerning he's the same he is the same amen god identifies himself by his own characteristics what he was he is now what it was yesterday he is today hebrews put it in the words jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever so jesus christ is the same he is the same the book of moderate three and 6. for it says for he says for i am the lord and i what and i change not for i am the lord and i change not god does not change his mind about his word god does not change you don't have to change why we change but god don't have to change because whatsoever god do it is perfect it's perfect in itself so he don't have to add to it or take away from it and that's what he said don't add to my word don't take away from my word are you with me because the word of the lord shall stand heaven and earth are passed away but my word it'll stand are you with me so the word of god is sure steadfast you can anchor your soul in the word and he's the same brother and sister what you get from being a christian or and what it means to you and i to be a christian to be a christian is the state for a fact that i am a part of god and i said he is the same the same god the bible tells us in saint john 1 1 in the beginning was the word isn't that right the word was with god in the word was god amen in the beginning that's when time started but god is eternal he's not limited to space he's not limited to time he's eternal so before the beginning before time as we say god the eternal god always existed amen jesus said i am the beginning and i am the end i am the first and i am the last and we know that we transition when eternity eternity when eternity broke down into time eternity was broke down into time now after a wild time comes into eternity if we have eternal life then we are part of god now amen eternity was broke down into time not time amen it's going back to eternity now so where are we headed brother and sister we're on a journey amen we're going back to where what adam fell from they meant god they meant the locals they meant that fountain of light the logos of god come down in the form of the words they meant the word was with god in the word was god they meant the god that was above us became the god that's with us ashamed god he is the same when he was about us he was a shame god in the pile of fire he was the same god the same god that was in the cloud and the pillar of fire that led the children of israel out of egypt he was the same was it another amen the same god moses said whom shall i say sent me he said tell them that i am that i am amen don't worry about a thing oh god sometimes they wanted to know what is thy name you're going to tell them that i am sent you that's all you need praise god i am and i'm saying he is the same he is this morning the shame praise god hallelujah he's ashamed oh hallelujah the same god that came on azusa street to see more those that started a revival to shake the nation what is set back the restoration of the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost then that he's ashamed now hallelujah we're serving a god amen that's a lie praise god he's allotted oh amen uh uh uh certain promises amen for certain seasons and certain times they meant god had allotted amen in the days of paul amen paul said i'm not sure to declare to you the whole council of they god but we find in iranians he tried to hold on to the promises of god hallelujah and martin holding on because he knew the word has identified his age praise god and he was walking in the promise of that age that god was a reflecting the light for that time oh god is reflecting the light they meant that god promised for you and i to be the i am right now he's the same today amen he's god that he that speaks for himself he's identified by his own characteristics yes he shows himself a lie god is i am the book of acts the second chapter praise god just praying lord what shall i say amen to encourage god people because sometimes they amen the people get in the state amen we're getting in was he said if god be false amen we heard about all the miracles that he done amen we heard about what he's done not in each of them we heard about what he's done he meant back in yesterday's remember god be false then why be all his miracles that our fathers told us about amen i'm excited this morning because i know of god before us that god is with us amen that miracles are here amen miracles are here the supernatural is here god is here amen he's saying to you and i i am the same amen i'm not a i was but i am right now amen not yesterday's god amen because i was god yesterday but i'm god today praise god we can't eat yesterday's manner amen it's got worms in it we need manna for the day the word that is allotted for your age and your day you need god now heaven i need a living word i need living brain praise god i needed a life oh yes acts second chapter he said in the 36th verse he says therefore let all the house of israel know surely i i really i really want you to let it sink in i want you to know oh surely amen because the people had crucified the lord amen and the peter those had experienced the baptism of the holy ghost and the people didn't understand the jews they were gathered there were parties and medes and elamites and dwellers and mesopotamians and catholic dossiers and ponies and phrases and pamphilia they were gathered from all over the world they admit that they saw something happen they saw these men speak in their own language the wonderful works of god and they was amazed and astonished said what meaning this they they didn't know what was going on then neither does the world know what's going on now amen they don't know what's happening now hey maybe there ought to be a fire happening there ought to be a shaking happening hey god hallelujah something has to identify you with the word for your day praise god there must be a holy ghost conviction there must be a holy ghost of communication there must be an outpouring of the holy ghost to quicken the word to bring it to life amen praise god and if the word is in you they met praise god and if it's identified for the hour you live in then the quicken power should be to identify that you are the word what is the spirit they meant that shows you that the blood has been applied or you would be praise god if the blood has been applied to your life then the holy ghost comes down and say amen because the blood has been applied the blood of jesus amen you are accepted hallelujah the fire proves that the sacrifice can be consumed amen god said i'll baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire let the fire fall may god do something this morning amen shake all the fear away from us all our doubts all the confusion got god speak for himself hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus well some of them are saying that these men are drunk they met these men are full of new wine amen they they they couldn't understand the fullness of what was happening and neither does the world understand what's happening before them amen as god reveals himself in his own word they meant god revealing himself in his own word they amen but people don't know amen amen they're looking at the letter amen and they don't look at the manifestation of the epistles or they meant that ye are written epistles written and read of all men they meant the word that's promised for this hour that the church would be praise god thank you jesus i'm glad this morning to be identified with the word word that was lauded for this age and that the promises of the overcomers in this age don't understand and identify with what they should overcome amen and they must manifest overcoming power because if jesus is there then there are overcomers you have overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony and this is the victory that overcometh the world even your faith amen you must have faith to overcome faith come by heaven and hand come by the word of god they meant the word of god identifies amen oh jesus oh god may something happen amen to bring the seed to life to bring you back out of time back to eternity glory to god make something quick can you change you from time to eternity praise god what is going on hallelujah you must pack in your body the hidden treasures hallelujah for we have this treasure in earthly justice that the ecstasy of the power may be of god and not of us amen what happened the tragic amen hallelujah oh hallelujah god has given you hidden treasures but he said if our gospel will be hidden it's here to them that are lost whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not least the light of the glory of god who is the image of god should shine unto them i pray that the light is shining the light is shining unto you as you said on last week amen that he abolished death amen death was

his own characteristics are you with me he's christ throughout all ages i got this cut off ain't god good you're serving a good god amen why don't you just let god have preeminence in your life amen praise god knowing that god can handle every situation every problem praise god don't you worry about a thing we're serving such a wonderful god a god of peace a god of joy the god that meets your expectation if you can believe that all things are possible to them to believe he says therefore let all the house of israel know surely that god has made that same jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart setting the peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do god has made that same jesus both the lord and christ amen praise god he said up above he said i will not leave his soul in hell neither would i suffer the holy one to seek corruption praise god god promised that i'm making amen your folds your footstool amen god take care of business won't he he'll do it for you will he if he did it for them why not jim why are you not walking in your victory praise god you know after you suffered a while the prophet said after god had given abraham the promise god took the promise and tried it amen god tested me even he gave him eyes of the promised son but god with the promise that he gave you god gives you your healing god gives you the victory but sometimes god will tell you what the very thing that he gave to you he'll text you and prove yours hey are you still gonna believe me i walk in victory i walk up this mountain in victory amen i'll tie eyes up in victory but i know my god the jehovah's ahead i know god is able to raise him up amen i'm gonna do what god said but i know i got the victory he said i am the last shall return i'm going to hallelujah because it's a part of the word got to be fulfilled that in the eyes that shall not see praise god and i that hadn't fulfilled that part of the promise but god knew amen that that part had to be fulfilled so now i'm not worried amen praise god i'm not worried about amen either not returning because i that got to amen praise god the word of promise god said i'm going to bless him and then isaac amen i'm going to bless his seed are you with me so god he when you've got something that you're holding on to hold on to it regardless of how tough or how rough it gets you know that he's the same god take your testimony and hold it up there before god and you say god you say i'm standing on the promises of christ my king through eternal ages let us praise his reign standing on the promises of god god you promised i got so many amen promises in this book amen and i know god you hadn't failed yet amen neither will you fail now he is the same praise god i ain't gonna close i'm gonna get a couple words from my brother ernest and then brother kelly and then i'll come back and close us out in a minute but while they coming he's the same yesterday today and forever what what's that song you know what a little bit of it such man jeremiah closes out after those two he's the same yesterday today and forever jesus

amen you appreciate the word this morning i thank the lord for let's get a word of hand clapping crazy amen i felt good to be here today amen and god had you in the right place at the right time amen and we got rained out and i'm sure many was tuning in but god had a word for him amen and you know i was going to minister this morning earnestly contending for the faith amen say what what for you can earnestly contend for it you got to know what the faith was amen and they believed in what was delivered to them they believed that jesus christ was the same amen yesterday the day and forever they believed what he was when he walked the show as a galilee he was still the same in the form of the holy ghost in them that's what they preached amen that's what they acted like and that's what god vindicated and you know jude asked us to earnestly contend for it come on they don't say the bible don't tell you to fight for many things but it tells you to fight for that amen and you know he talked about how certain men crept in unawares and they began to turn the gospel around and get you away from that come on but he said i want you to get back to that come on i want you to fight for that don't just come and just be a formal church and just take intellectual word and just hear good sermons and go home but i want you to contend for that faith come on i want you to know that what i was in the flesh come on that i'm still the same in the form of the holy ghost come on the works that i do he said that you will do also amen that's what they preach come on and that's what we gonna preach amen and god gonna do the vindicating it ain't up to us to vindicate it god gonna do what he said he gonna do how many believe that this morning you know i'm stirred because god is just speaking to our heart the other night we were speaking on faith and i said the thing is i says what's your response come on god is there the whole time he just waiting to see what your response is going to be come on god waiting to see what you're going to do come on uh crisis and trials are hitting all over come on we all going through but god is waiting to see what your response is going to be i believe the devil mad this morning because he said all that i don't hit him with and they still praising god they still shouting they still uh confessing that god is still a healer how many of
