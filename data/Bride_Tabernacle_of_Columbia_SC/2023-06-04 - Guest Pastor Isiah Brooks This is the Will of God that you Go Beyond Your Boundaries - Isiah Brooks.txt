sure I tell her we appreciate you even though we're here on a sad occasion my one of my niece died and she'll be buried on tomorrow I played a very important part in her early life I used to be much so like the babysitter in a way I remember when she was born changed her diapers fed her and of course we had a a real close connection until I got saved and then after I got saved things went a different way I don't know whether she met the Lord but I did tell her about him and now it's between her and God thank God for our brother Simmons The church here I always feel at home when I'm here so if I act crazy here that's what I do at home and you know I'm not ashamed or What the Lord Has Done and uh now I'm going to tell you I'm going to have church if nobody else will I'm going to enjoy Jesus if no one else does as we stand let us turn to Romans 8 14. I believe this is a time of urgency I believe that the church is growing cold many people who have are Christians oh love seems to be diminishing they don't love the Lord like they used to and they forget that this is a battle I remember when I first received the Holy Ghost I thought I was going to be shouting to Jesus come didn't understand that there was coming a lot of battles and I like to see myself as a a battle scarred veteran because I don't want to go to heaven with no scars I want to look like I've been in a battle I want to not only look like it but I want to know by God's grace that this has been a battle and I know one thing the greater the battle the sweeter Heaven is going to be we forget about that we we sometimes look at the Battle and forget about what comes afterwards but it's great victory in the name of Jesus Romans 8 to 14 8 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's the only one I'm going to read there then I ask that you turn with us to Saint John the eighth chapter 14 through the 46th verse we enjoyed the song service we were in the back but somehow the music the organ and all was really uh soothing my soul I got caught up in the spirit back there I don't know whether y'all heard me or not wasn't trying to be heard but I figured I was pretty loud enough but uh it was it got pretty good Saint John 8 44-46 yeah of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a vote not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh the lie he's speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth ye Believe Me Not which of you convinced convinces me of sin if I say the truth why do ye not believe me one more scripture Malachi 3 I just love this this scripture Malachi 3 16-18 and then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name they and they shall be mine said the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not let us pray pray dear gracious father we come before your Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us truly Lord there's no words to express our gratitude toward you right now my soul is just rejoicing in spite of all of the oppositions because I realize Lord God we're about ready to embrace eternity in a way our minds cannot comprehend but we realize also Lord that it's been because of your grace not because we've been such a great person we realize Lord that we have all sinned and come short of your glory we all needed a savior and I thank you Lord Jesus Christ for being my savior you may all in all and I thank you Lord for being who you are in my life bless the service in a special way I know you will I know you will you promised Lord where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst so we know that you're here Lord and we appreciate you may God help us honor you give us Grace to move completely out of your way we give you the glory praise and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we have been ministering at my own assembly and so many things have we've tried to accomplish with the people foreign but we realize a man that only God can touch the heart only God can change the heart we come to church not as Believers that are traditional you know how we come up in prayer we come up in prayer we want prayer and you're very seldom see a tear drop or someone else that is broken it's hard to find that Brokenness in the people somehow the cares of this life has hardened the hearts even for the Believers we come and we think that we're satisfying God by showing up but I remember what God said to the Jews he says if you don't praise me I'll raise up a rock so God is not looking for praisers are worshipers he's got them when we think about and I don't think and I just want to take my time this morning because this message to me is a matter of life and death the word of God is a matter of life and death but it's up to God to unveil to you the Naked Truth people say I want truth give me truth but when truth comes and when it comes in a way that is different from the way that you've been preached to in the past years we tried to screen truth by our own systematic way our old systematic way and when we do that we we we we fail to see truth when Jesus was crucified he was naked he didn't have a covering because covering represents religion he had nothing there it was absolutely the naked word he became naked naked that we might be clothed what a shame your savior and my savior was lifted up on Calvary naked who would follow such a man who dies like a like a failure but that was his victory and when he was down Calvary amen he had you and I in his mind you and me he understood what he was doing he wasn't LED blindly but he was led willfully to Calvary now the thing that I don't understand even now is why people are not happy it's the joy of the Lord and the reason why many people are not happy is because they still have that old cloak of religion on but when you recognize the word of your day when you understand that you've been Justified and so you've never sinned in the first place when you understand that every penalty of death was paid for you you could not have done it it took Jesus it took a lamb without spot wrinkle or blemish he paid the price and the Bible said he became we became he became our sin that we might become his righteousness well I accepted by faith I might not look like I'm righteous but when you're covered by the blood Hallelujah it is not only just righteousness but the blood of Jesus Christ amen held the Holiness of God [Music] Hallelujah but nowadays people don't want they say they want the Holy Ghost but you can't get it until you're willing to change Hallelujah that's why the Bible's people said uh the the word comes along and tells us if you repent and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said well what do you mean brother Brooks that's when you are in full obedience to the word because he was in full obedience to the word you personally cannot be in full obedience because you're sinners you're faulty but when you take a lamb Jesus Christ himself comes into who who there was no spot there was no wrinkle there was no blemish he became your savior and it's in him you are accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah all the joy that came to me when I knew see it's a personal thing you got to know you're free Hallelujah you got to know that the blood of Jesus Christ was enough hallelujah it's not your church it's not your religion it's not your your composition is Jesus Christ and him alone my subject is is the will of God that you go beyond your boundaries everybody loves it you have your comfort zones wake up everybody looking at everything but me but we must I see what I'm talking about it's something that's wrong with the spirit of the people there's a time we used to run to church to hear the word now we find out that people don't that it's like they can't hear it with all of the preaching that you preach it seems like it goes beyond I don't know it's like the people have a spell cast upon them may God help us because the only one that can get you out of this pit is God himself and let me say it like this you won't be the only one that has ever been in the pit David says Lord deliver me from this horrible pit oh I'm coming and God was the only one [Music] that could deliver David Hallelujah and right now God is the only one Jesus himself is the only one that can deliver you some of us think well I don't need Deliverance yes you do because God said I would that you be hot or cold there is no lukewarm Christians in heaven and none of them were qualify to make it not when it comes to a rapture Calvary he bore my shame you know I can't preach a message without preaching Calvary that's the very gospel Hallelujah and until you oh I love the message but you don't even know what happened to Calvary Calgary is the message Christ died for you he took your place oh people let me tell you something the early Christians didn't have all that we have y'all better hear me they didn't have no books they didn't have no tapes but you know what they had the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and they were led by the spirit of God they knew right from wrong by the Holy Ghost that's how they were able to identify the Antichrist because they had Christ Hallelujah and when you got the Hallelujah when you've got the Holy Ghost you don't need a book to study to see whether it's right or wrong the Holy Ghost checks you oh come on somebody what you gonna do when they take your books what you're going to do when they take your Bible and you don't have the Holy Ghost how on Earth will you know what's right from wrong Hallelujah I saw my brother Matt come in always admired you brother always if not we don't get to talk that much but I've always admired you I I got my reasons for that but I appreciate you amen God is good yes sir when we when we think about Who you gonna follow you understand me when I say that you got one or it you're gonna follow God or you're gonna follow the devil huh one thing about Jesus he's naked he doesn't have a cloak his word is his word what he says is what he means Hallelujah but Satan cloaks himself he disguises himself right this old evil disguises himself like an angel of Light amen hallelujah but not like Jesus Jesus Christ is who he is Hallelujah he is God what is your ambition and I'm gonna I gotta jump I'm spending too much time with this but you know uh your ambition uh is is to become the word you've got to grow into it or it has to grow into you however we want to look at it because because you have to realize this is manifestation time I was telling my church I said when I was when God planted himself in me I was a little Christian a little boy Christian you understand me I made a lot of mistakes I grew up and I've grown up and I'm still growing I didn't stay the same you understand me and whatever is alive never stays the same I don't care if it's a kitten it's going to turn into a mature cat it was a baby it's going to turn into an adult if it's alive it's going to grow and whatever life that's in it is going to manifest itself y'all hear what I'm saying it's not something you can put on not like this crazy generation we got now Hallelujah that want to be something they're not oh I was telling my church the other day I said y'all better get the Holy Ghost you might wake up thinking you're a cat huh you better get the Holy Ghost you might think you're a dog because my brother looks right there in Japan this man thinks he's so much like a dog he went and got him a suit a whole uniform looking out the window like a dog but see that is the insanity that's now striking the nation and let me tell you if you don't have that token if you don't have that Holy Spirit Hallelujah you will believe a lie in this day let's put it in those Moses day you had to believe Moses or you had to believe pharaoh right now Moses said listen if you don't reply the blood the death angel is going to get you I love somebody let me put it in terms of your term our term God don't care if you're a doctor if you're a lawyer if you're a policeman if you are a teacher if the blood is not applied the death angel will get you hallelujah how do you know what's going on brother Brooks because people oh they come to this message and they clothe themselves with the letter of it but they never get born again they never get the Holy Ghost now you see what they really are it was always there whatever the nature is in you it will manifest itself and it's not going to get any better unless you repent you see how they got quiet on that one people don't want to repent because everybody think they're okay Hallelujah you know what even if brother Brandon was my pastor past it never would have saved me hello people go to my church I can't save them I'm not a savior there's only one Savior and that's Jesus Christ Hallelujah people say oh with Moses he was a deliverer yes he was but it wasn't Moses it was the god in Moses and all your two in that generation saw who to deliver a while I wonder whether the people are seeing who to deliver really is this morning oh help of Jesus y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but I'm gonna tell you like this it is a desperate time it is a time where you know that you know you don't feel the anointing of God like you're used to and if you are honest you will acknowledge that but the problem is we're setting still we're not doing anything about it you don't even realize that death shifting you is that right oh that's what God told Peter Peter don't you understand the devil desire to sift you as wheat we don't see amen the condition that we're in amen is not where God wants us to be oh don't look at me let me say it like this what I'm preaching here I preach to my church because that's the hour we're living in people who can't even love each other but call yourself Christians can't even forgive and if you can't forgive all your Christianity is in vain well you don't know what that person did to me let me ask you a question what have you done to Christ how many times you've denied him how many times you've been ashamed of him oh come on somebody how many times when you should have witnessed for him you did not Don't Preach like that brother all I can tell you is this I'm gonna tell you just the way he wants me to tell you Hallelujah I haven't even got to my message yet let me move on it because I haven't even got that in Jesus day amen they had to choose between Jesus and Barabbas Barabbas was a murderer but he was a systematic believer he was a Jew he wasn't a gentile his God was Jehovah but what did it do for him what did that religion do for him it caused him to unite with Rome to crucify Jesus y'all hear me now you've got a choice who you're going to serve I'm coming see what it is now the reason why we don't see God like we should because everybody's God is all mixed with something mixed with some kind of idea ideology or something you got you got things so mixed and this is why I tell my children I I know what God is doing he's perfected me and he's got me going through a lot of these things in my life because I I need it I want it I want change and this is why we come to church to be changed we come to be corrected oh I don't mind the shout and the dance but when I leave here I want to know that I got something that changed me that made me think now in a different way mixed everybody you know they got their Creeds they got their affiliations and all kinds of entertainment going on and you know it's all mixed up you know I could have a big big uh fellowship and uh at the church and everybody will show up but then when you go to church hardly nobody shows up Hallelujah matter of fact if you come to my Wednesday night services you'd feel sorry for me if I got a good 10 people in church but I don't care I preach like I got a whole church full because in reality I do now let me go on why are you saying these things because you got to realize that here it was when they were coming out of Egypt they had to eat all of the Lamb they had to eat the entrance intros and all of the bitter parts and they couldn't leave anything and I thought about that this morning I'm not I'm feasting on the meat Hallelujah now this may seem simple but I'm thinking on the meat which is the Lamb of God and what am I doing what did it do for them it gave them strength for the journey see without the word without the message you have no strength for the journey and what happens you get weak don't tell me you call for a prayer meeting how many people come to the prayer meeting excuse me how many people shows up Hallelujah oh I'm not picking on you I'm trying to pinch you you know what pinch that's a very uncomfortable feeling and some people can do it in there twist it well if I could just pinch you and twist it a little bit just to get your attention even if I can make you mad at me I know you'll remember Hallelujah now you say what do you mean brother Brooks see we can't sympathize with the message we must become it y'all understand me that is the only thing that's going to identify you separate you from being the fake or the real Hallelujah it is the only thing that's going to make you different from all ever ever I don't care our fellowship for church church I don't care about much of the adoption it ain't about that it's whether you have you have you been have you been baptized with the Holy Ghost since you believe right we welcome change we welcome correction Hallelujah but I want you to understand you've got to decide which one you are am I the seed of God or am I the seed of the devil um oh when I go to church so did Judas so the king oh I like the preaching you know and this is what makes me Marvel hey Judas had all of these gifts he had everything but one thing he did not have was The Giver he could not receive that Jesus Christ was truly the Messiah Hallelujah he saw the signs he saw the Wonders he saw the Miracles but he had his own agenda Hallelujah there's only one agenda in this thing is to make sure that people see Jesus Christ not so much brother brought I don't even care if my name is ever remembered but it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm trying to get people to see you say well what do you mean brother Brooks let me tell you this the devil will stamp that name out if he can well because there's only power in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah is that right like I was telling my church I said you can't come to church with your little attitudes and whether you're going to set on somebody that's seeing if you don't like them you're gonna you're not gonna say amen and all that nonsense go up we ought to be so glad to see each other in this place Hallelujah don't worry about me when I backslide because you could have helped me when I was standing you wasn't standing with me Hallelujah then you want to talk about the person that batch lies shame on you what did you do to keep them keep them where was your love Hallelujah you know very very rarely will you see somebody go try to catch a backslider somebody backslide you just talk about them and keep going and some of us still got that Progressive mentality we won't even speak to them find that in the word huh find it in the word it ain't there leave 99 and and for the one what about you because when Christ in you he behaves like Christ Hallelujah let me move on many that are led by the spirit of God just the other day and I'm not boasted on me my wife and I we had to go down to Lima Ohio and I was actually going down there to rest what rest but anyway that's what I was doing I thought I'd visit my son let's camp out at his place he was too busy we had to end up going to a restaurant I mean a hotel but nevertheless I used to love Captain D's but I didn't want to go to Captain D's my wife with the Captain D's so I went with her so she we ordered some food and stuff and and then I'm setting down as I sat down there was uh two uh three white folks uh there uh a lady and and two ladies and a man and I'm sitting there and the Holy Spirit said get up just like a natural man go testify go tell them how God has delivered you from your prostrate cancer and people it did come from here my looks like my shirt shook it came from my heart and I sat there and I'm like Lord these people don't know me and I'm I'm in Lima Ohio you maybe will not understand what I'm talking about but anyway I'm sitting there and he said get up go testify and you know how we do Lord is that really you and the next thing I know I'm up out of my seat and I'm headed toward the bathroom and I knew I was supposed to talk to them so I'm going towards like I'm going to the bathroom I had to turn around and I said man I said ma'am do I know you she said no I don't I said I know you don't but I had to get a conversation going I said I said I come to tell you about what Jesus has done for me I said I used to have prostate cancer and I'm totally free I said I even got paperwork it been showing that I had cancer and I got paperwork showing I have no cancer at all Hallelujah I said they said this Castle ain't gone to my bone and all that kind of stuff the lady started crying she said my husband right now is suffering from prostrate cancer and he must have been bad because I said ma'am do you mind if I pray for you so we start praying and Captain D's you know what I'm saying I didn't say no no uh no I prayed like I was praying in church and I prayed for him and everything else and this man so believed he got up to go to the restroom to check it out he comes back out the door but he's a little discouraged because it didn't happen instantaneously so I sit down and said I said listen I said I'm trying to remember the order but let me say it like this I said uh they said where do you go to church I said uh ma'am I'm I'm from Iowa my church is in Iowa I said so you know I don't know you I said but he does I didn't know your husband had cancer I said but he did he knows it I said if we just prayed for him and I believe God is just healed your husband and I looked at him I said listen no I went back to my seat God said get back up explain to them so I went to there and says listen God could have healed you and it could have been a miracle he didn't give you that just now as far as I can see I said but listen he healed you I know he did I said that wasn't me I don't know you but it was God who made me get up out of my seat oh y'all don't understand I got to preach what I feel like crying right now but my point is I explained to him I said uh uh healing he takes about three days four days in the four days you deliver it and it might get a little worse but remember this day remember this one this moment this man prayed for you and God said you understand me and when I said do you believe that both says yes we believe and they walked out of the restaurant you say brother Brooks how do you know the hill God said so Hallelujah I don't they don't need to know my name they don't need to know where I come from but they do need to know Jesus healed Hallelujah and they themselves were Christians y'all hear what I'm saying that's what being led by the spirit he said why are you saying this because I have been praying that God would restore my hearing of his voice that I would be obedient to whatever he wanted me to do so it was a blessing to me to be able to do that people of God y'all remember today God would speak to us all the time go do this go do that say this say that and we did it didn't even think about it but somehow we loud allow that to get away from us but God is a promise he said I shall restore and all the gifts that you always used to have they're still there God is wanting to restore those things but you got to put yourself in a place where he can restore Hallelujah you got to become more serious you got to be more consecrated you got to be more uh considered considering of him and his will this is the will of God that he be seen in human flesh your flesh My Flesh Hallelujah thank you Jesus we don't understand you go to people I remember the time brother Simmons when we we go to people's house we talk that's all we talk about was Jesus we talked about the word that's all we knew to talk about we didn't take talk about football games basketball games and who's the famous stars and Beyonce and whatever we didn't care about the world the world had no it didn't even have no kind of attraction to us we were on the streets preaching singing that's where my first Pulpit was I don't even know where those people are that I baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I don't care that's God's business can Philip baptize a eunuch I don't think he took Tab and said well he always remind me of where you are no no y'all hear me so what am I trying to say until we get to love Jesus so much that we could talk about him even to strangers that's what Malachi said he said if you talk about him he's got a book of remembrance talk to each other about him he's got a book every time you talk about him can I say it like this you get a perk you get a plus he writes it down he remembers it and he said when I come to gather my jewels and right now he's Gathering his jewels hallelujah oh my God what's the thing that's driving you whatever drives you is what you worship ah Hallelujah yep whatever driving you it is the thing that you are worshiping you call that demonic possession oh y'all don't got quiet because you know what the only thing that should be driving you or leading you is the Holy Ghost they that allowed alive are the spirit of God they are the sons of God Hallelujah when you when you really got God on the inside you understand that your sins has been forgiven and you know the devil said well you you ain't worthy enough to talk to nobody about Jesus yes I am there was a woman amen that talked to Jesus at the well she wasn't worthy at one point but when God gave her that water she ran to a city and said come see a man y'all hear what I'm saying when you know you covered by the blood you see yourself as God sees you Hallelujah you say how do God see me he see me perfect he see me Sanctified he see me holy that's the way I see me Hallelujah you say well what do you mean he took my penalty he took my death he took everything I was worthy I was worthy of death many many many times but God took it all with his stripes I am healed with the stripes you are healed let me tell you something if I came to you and I gave you a hundred dollars today you won't never forget me and God has given you more than a hundred dollar bill we so easy to forget him and he loves us still huh I heard somebody say you know me and my wife we have a practice when we have our Thanksgiving dinner that that last thing we do before everybody dismissed is that we stand up and everybody has to testify give a testimony whether you're a Christian or not if you're at my table you're going to give a testimony of what God has done for you during the year last year we we got caught up and we forgot and my wife and I we felt so condemned you say that's nutrition tradition no it's more than a tradition because my our hearts were in it and we wanted to thank God that we're thankful for that turkey oh y'all see some of y'all don't even know it but I came in a day that if you had a piece of chicken on Thanksgiving you was doing good but some of us we don't grew up in a generation we have turkey and ham we have all that stuff but in my day the best drink we could have had was Kool-Aid that's the way it was we weren't rich we didn't have the wealth of the wild but we had God we had a Praying Mother that new God y'all better hear what I'm saying I don't care I'd rather have nothing as long as I have Jesus and I don't say that to be saying it that is the real deal because at the end of the road they're going to take everything from you anyhow made free from sin God made us free and now we're the Servants of righteousness but we're so busy thinking about this flesh when God ain't worried about that God doesn't condemn sin in the flesh he wanted to see the Inner Man live that man that's in you he want to see that live Hallelujah would you ever have right yeah brother but you don't understand but I've got failures in my flesh I want somebody to raise their hand who don't have failures in their flesh and you're going to be like that to Jesus change it but that's not who you are amen it's what's on the inside and in a man is who you are and you got to perfect that you said Brotherhood this message is simple I trust is simple enough to bring something that's what we need we need we need Revival huh we need Revival I can remember I can remember the time even in this church amen what no you know the thing about a shouting dancing but most of all it wasn't it wasn't difficult to see tears when the last we've seen tears even in my church I do an altar call and the people come up for prayer they're not standing like this very seldom like this you pray for them like they I don't know what they want someone said like this laying on hands ain't gonna do you no good if you don't believe the word preached oh my oh my I guess I'm preaching like a pastor today and yes you got to choose your leader and your leader is life or death that's it I don't know what's wrong with the people but I think to myself if I could just say listen you don't know where death is man you could be healthy it's all get out and God will cause your heart to stop like that you got the juice now this is oh well I wait till I get older somebody said to me not long ago well I trust that the Rapture don't take place until I get married I said to myself I hope it don't take that long because you're not sure you're gonna get married I don't understand it When Heaven is going to give you everything you missed in this world everything you're not gonna get to heaven say oh I just wish I had this and wish I had no it won't be like that it'll be beyond anything you'll never miss this side of life you'll be so thankful God has delivered you from it Hallelujah like I tell people I said if I die Don't You Raise Me from the dead unless you got a thus said the Lord I believe you might have the power but don't you do it then I'm serious when I just struck at all this time to get this the first thing I want to probably say is like what do you want let me hurry up you I know you got things to do there but this is the thing this is the scripture that really inspired second chronicles please I hope you're being blessed this morning people of God I'm screaming because I see people who they've come so long and and and and and I know the Bible said these signs should follow them and say well we don't need all of that yes you do you need all of that it's like telling me an apple tree don't need apples yes you do don't tell me your Apple Tree and you can't produce no apples pear tree yeah I will prove and that's what Jesus won't he wants fruits of this message that we claim we follow second chronicles 15. 12 through 16. you know I've realized one thing I recognize one thing people say well don't judge me by the way you look but the way I look for your well I mean whatever you are inside is going to reflect the outside that's why I can tell people that don't have joy they got a lot of religion but they don't have that peace they don't have that Joy people getting wrinkles in their faces because they don't smile enough you know something's wrong with that how many of y'all remember when the Holy Ghost would be so much on us people could see the glory of God I'll be looking for that glow right I hope you look at me can you see the glow you just that's important to me I know it sounds like a joke but I really want people to see light you know how we can look Sometimes some of y'all spiritual you can see Darkness over people yeah I had to preach at my church the other day a few weeks ago here we had a special service on on Saturday and these brothers went out gathered together did some stuff that they shouldn't have been doing the Holy Ghost talking to me while I'm in the Pulpit see a lot of times when I tell them what God is telling me they think somebody done told me yeah somebody did it was Jesus Christ and then they all come in with that old nasty unclean Spirit hanging all over them and I'm preaching and I could have named them one by one and when I call the altar call only one man repented what's gonna happen to those people you understand me when God deliberately comes right there and shows you and tell you and talk to you and you let the devil reason it out y'all hear what I'm saying that's how it is brother Simmons coming I know he's a preacher I've seen discernment in this ministry there are times where we were at a place and I'm looking for the exit rather than trying to find a place to wait a way to get out because I'm thinking among these Apostolic people they're gonna Stone us I've seen him I'm not exalted the man I'm talking about the gift of the man I remember when I was in Africa he come right down the line with it and that church didn't repent and there were there more Darkness now than they've ever been the problem is you don't know what you got hmm he's not like other preachers and he never will be thank God and I'll be honest with you I'm so when I come here I feel comfortable see you can't love Jesus if you can't love your pastor show me y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but I'm gonna tell you something maybe you need to whoop you a little bit more you all done got to something crazy I'm telling you the truth you know you get children they get spoiled and then they get then they get disrespectful my last don't look at me now I'm telling you my my one daughter was 21 years old when she got her last whooping you live in my house you go by my rules you don't go by my rules you get whooped 21 year old or not if you want you grown get your own my sons know that too let me stop I might look soft until I get angry when you get let me move on I'm sorry forgive me Lord second chronicles 15. 12-16 this is my last scripture and they entered into a company you know what it's talking about Israel during the time of Asa and Asia amen means doctor or healer amen and you know you know every word means something one of the things you know I was just amazed and maybe I read it before but when I saw that Judah was the one that led the children out of the out of the the the Wilderness into Jordan that was the tribe and when I realized I said oh my God I said what's wrong with the people where's the praise where is the praise and let me tell you what I dislike I dislike when we've got to look at TV or look at some kind of thing on some kind of something to learn how to worship and then we try to pattern ourselves out that when God said they spit out of my face I've spit them out of my mouth that ain't what he wants if he wanted they meant you you to dance the way they do that he would he would incorporate the the nightclub huh I remember when brother Simmons said that to he said if God didn't excuse Elvis he ain't going to excuse you and you don't know what I deal with and I don't want to I deal with an African tribe there in my church and and I'm telling you they know how to move but they moving the wrong way hello they get mad with me and I use I don't say brother Simmons said but I used the same quote as if God ain't gonna excuse Elvis He showing us can they do worse than Elvis now I don't know what all Elvis did but I for what I've seen it ever do he can't compare to no that Rhythm oh man but anyway let me move on I'm coming down to the end of it there was a spirit and this was ASA ASA mother was an idolata she had to worship her and ASA when he did all God inspired him to do to Israel to bring them back to God he literally put her away now we know the story of Israel today they're here today and gone tomorrow they always are backsliding on God no matter what God did for them but they always had one solution turn back to God my people they which are called by thy name if they would humble themselves and pray and seek my face right humble yourself pray seek my face those are the steps that's all they had to do God said he would heal the land he would hear that prayer come and heal the land that's how it is now if you humble yourself seek his face and pray God will heal you God will restore your joy he'll restore your peace he'll restore your home let me say it like this whenever order is broken it brings chaos Adam and Eve broke the order it brought chaos whenever Israel broke the order it brought chaos is that right when Ezra when he when they broke David when he broke order bringing that that the Ark of the Covenant on the cart it brought chaos it brings death and you're wondering why churches are in church homes let me tell you like I said here before you want Revival in the church give me Revival in the home you know what that means Brothers you got to get in your place and sisters you got to get in yours as long as she's your head is chaos yeah it's true he became the head of Adam it brought chaos yeah that's the truth I don't care if she's she still must stay in her place oh I didn't hear Holly no amens from the women oh yeah and brothers you gotta help her demon I don't mean you you you puff your chest out and say wait a minute I'm the man no no no no no no there's more than that kind of a way you got to use some wisdom you use wisdom because let me tell you something about a woman most of the time when she get out of her place she's trying to help you brethren at least that's the way my wife is and oftentimes you know we take offense to it because of our Pride let me move on so here's the thing I don't know why I'm going the way I'm going God knows I trust somebody's being blessed but I'm trying to tell you I had some preacher from India tell me the last time I was here I met him at the hotel he said I'm a deep preacher I'm going over to brother so and so church and I'm a deep preacher I'll talk to myself I'm glad you're going over there you think you have long forgive me if I'm wrong I'm like okay you take your deep stuff and keep going you know what what is deep people don't even know what that means it was the Pharisees who were deep and that depth kind of took them in error they it had you know deep after a while you get so deep you interpret God's word the wrong way they were so deep they were blind Jesus was standing right there doing everything and they still call him a devil yes it's just the way it is now let me tell you something this is what has kept me nobody put me in nobody could take me out and when you know you to see the god nobody can't say to you well if you don't believe belong to this then you ain't part of it like are you serious really who gave you that Authority you've got to understand amen when God reveals to you who you are I don't care how messed up you are nobody can take that Revelation from you let them say what they want to say but why y'all criticizing me I'm gonna be enjoying Jesus you know what every time I do that I think about sister had it right she'd come in sister had had it right handy Jackson that's right they're about the same Hallelujah amen you love the Lord but look what he says in the 13th verse that whosoever would not see out of Israel shall be put today whether small or great where the man or woman let's go back up to the 12th verse and they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoever would not seek the Lord with all their heart and with all their soul God a god of Israel shall be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman and they swear unto the Lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with Coronet you hear what I'm saying it was a Revival a Revival going on because there's ah we got the whole people that's willing to see God with all of their heart that after the word was opened the message desperation was preached in the prophet said like this he said if you do not fall into desperation if desperation don't strike you you're going to miss it president you must seek the Lord now with all of your heart with all of your soul with all of your mind it's hey we've had enough of the world oh it's the truth and I don't care let me say it like this and let me let me stop right here I I went totally a different way but God knows but let me show you one thing about covet I used to so love to eat I still do but nothing tastes the same anybody know what I'm talking about you can eat and it's just like something's missing right I get so disappointed because it'll smell so good but then when you start eating it it's not the same something has changed I don't know whether it's just in my case but alone I don't know but one thing I I do know the word of God has never changed it's still sweet as the honey in the cone it's still everything he was yesterday he is today but until we get in our hearts in mind that God is not looking for another church he's not looking for another group of people this is not a group effort anyway this is all individuals and it's more life than anything think about how easy Israel had it nobody had to do Miracles but Moses all they had to do was follow but when Joshua came on it was no longer a one-man Ministry Joshua says hey this whole Army we gonna March around this whole Army is a part of the ministry y'all better hear what I'm saying see that's the point the whole church is the ministry it's not just brother Simmons it's all of you but you gotta follow you got to join together and be one mind one a card to defeat the enemy y'all hear what I'm saying oh God have mercy on us I love Joshua Jehovah savior said all all I need you to do is just walk around Jericho seven times y'all know how that works he said when it's time for the blowing up the trumpet we're going to blow the trumpet and we're gonna watch out he didn't say the preacher gonna Shout out we ain't gonna shout let everybody shout everybody that's marching Shout what the victory did they had the fight God brought the walls down Hallelujah and you must understand today if you want God to to to to to to Really bless you you got to follow the leader Paul said follow me as I follow Christ don't complain you'll be like Moses let me you'll be like the children of Israel with Moses I forgot to bring one more thought one more thought please just one more thought his mother her name was Marca and Marca means oppression it means to pull down depress when you're worn you know wore out it means to fasten and that's where a lot of people are now you fastened you've been depressed oppressed and whatever more but you ain't telling nobody because your religion is covering you you don't have the joy that you used to have that's marker because you've left God you need to return to him Hallelujah that's the only way you're going to get your joy back that's the only way you're going to have that shouting account you got to be willing to follow God with all of your heart ASA said you my mama but you got to go Hallelujah we don't need depression in this church we don't need oppression in this church we need Joy so that when a non-believer come in here they can see God is in the camp but when they come in here and they see people just as sad as they are how you're going to give them something when there's nothing you can give them Hallelujah that's what God wants he said uh he said uh he told that woman at the well I'll give you water it's bringing up to life is that right now let me tell you something when she ran to the city she didn't run with a cup she dropped the buckets because she became the whale y'all better hear what I'm saying see when the real Holy Ghost is in you you become the well huh people are thirsting and hungering for God y'all hear what I'm saying there's no no driving force like a thirst thirsting and hungry for God and you're the wow and you let that old system whatever that is cloud your mind and you let fear get a hold of you what if I'm rejected you just plant the seed it ain't your business gotta let whatever happen but you need to tell them just what what you need to tell them in closing you got to bring it to the full Counseling of God I'm sorry I went so long I know I know y'all got things to do and my apology but I can't help but to cry out right now and I hope that that your your next event wasn't clouding your mind where you couldn't hear the word Satan will do that you know well if he don't hurry up I mean we got a certain time and I got to do this and all of these thoughts you don't even know that's this that's the devil keeping you away from hearing the word you love God y'all know I'm a long waiting to preacher anyhow and I try my best to be short but
