hallelujah hallelujah we're just going to get right into the word of God hallelujah don't want to keep you too long I've been given privilege to preach as long as I need to not one amen uhoh I'm in trouble amen we're not going to hold you long by God's grace but as you stand we want you to uh consider the word of God with us we are living in uh a glor glorious time to some it may be a hard time but I'm glad for it because this hour for this hour we were ordained this is my day this is your day and I'm looking forward to everything that's coming my way because I realize tonight what it is going to produce I'm not looking at something that uh that I I can't comprehend but I'm looking at something that God has laid before us so that we could see and understand what the finished product is going to be as we stand let us turn to the scripture amen according to First Corinthians we're going to start reading there at the 15th chapter starting at the ninth verse we'll read down to the 10th give honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we thank God for our pastor and brother amen Henry Simmons thank God for you all uh having me I actually came to encourage and support our brother Robert Sumpter in his time of bement uh but in so doing God has allowed me to minister as well I counted a privilege and an honor to do so um and I trust that somehow God blesses us tonight in a special way 1 Corinthians 15 beginning at the 9th verse for I am the least of the Apostles that am not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God this is the part I like but by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed rested upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me he labored because of the grace of God that was with him 2 Corinthians the 11th chapter the 23rd verse there we'll start reading and we'll read down to the 30th are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in labors more abundant in Stripes above measure in prison more frequent in deaths of of the Jews five times received thy 40 Stripes save one twice was I beaten with rods once I was stoned twice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day have I spent in the deep in Journeys often in Perils of waters and Perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the Heathen imp perils in the cities imp perils in the wilderness imp Perils of the sea imp perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watching often in hunger and thirst in fasting often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without Hallelujah that which cometh upon me daily the care of all all the churches who is weak and am I not weak who is often offended excuse me who is offended and I burn not if I must need Glory I reg glory of the things which concern my infirmities let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being The God Who You Are We Love You Lord not for the materialistic things that you've given us but we love you the most because of the revelation of yourself that you have placed in our hearts something that no man can take away from us no trial no tribulation no Peril nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus and on tonight I pray Lord that you bless this service in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message focusing on his will and I want to really emphasize that God will is perfect I don't know how we all feel tonight but as the word of the hour and I'm not talking about the flesh part of me I'm talking about the regene part I am and so are you we are the word of the hour and So speaking in that way it may even sound Blasphemous but I want to say that God did not stop there at a revealing of a prophet but I want to say this in in all that has been revealed my highest ambition in this life is only to see Jesus Christ glorified I live for that now that sounds like my words but those are the prophet's words but I want to say that if I should live a million years I had that much life to live I want to live every minute of it for him now you talking about A Love Affair these are not words that just going to provoke your curiosity but these are words of confession something that is coming from someone's heart and if I knew I be turned down at the end it is such a privilege to live for him why because he is so real and I have personally have found never found nothing in all of my traveling travels of life that would anyway compare with the fellowship that I have together with him alone can I can I get a witness I love church I love singing I love fellowshipping with my brothers and my sisters but when I get down to pray and the fellowship that I receive when I'm in prayer cannot compare in my prayer he's real he's not a figment of my imagination he talks with me he walks with me and he tells me I am his own thinking about Sister Mary when you come down to the end of your journey you got to know him and most of all he's got to know you thinking about Paul we looking at a time where the Corona virus have shut everything down practically the only thing that this Corona cannot shut down is the Bride of Jesus Christ you see we don't need a building though God has given us one somebody help me here because we have a revelation that we are the temple of God when I want joy I have joy if I need peace I have peace all things that I need I find in him amen Hallelujah somebody Paul who was a great man of God and I trust that I won't be long but he was a great man of God but Paul said I'm the least of them why Paul because I was one who persecuted the church I stood there and I cheered for them to to to to strike Steven down but by the grace of God I am what I am Paul was saying I can't change anything I can't change my past I can't change my future all I know is I am what I am and the grace of God is with me Hallelujah God could have left us blind as far as I'm concerned this message is the greatest thing that ever struck the Earth bear with me just a moment Paul says I was in the will of God when I was laboring abundantly I was in the will of God when I was beaten by rods I was in the will of God when they C when they when they when they killed me brought brought me to death I was in the will of God Paul said every one of my infirmities I will glory in why because I realized I was in the will of God see often time when we go through hardships and trials and tests we feel like oh somewhere I'm out of the will of God but not necessarily so the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by God hallelujah and when you have amen by God's grace when you have a relationship with him you don't wonder where you are cuz you know he's leading you even if people don't understand even if they don't agree with what's going on in your life you can still say hallelujah anyhow oh my because you recognize one thing I am in the will of God hallelujah God's will is perfect and we want to let his will be done I'm coming to something in just a moment hallelujah what is the will you know the will is that power of control that power that controls is on the mind you know it brings what's that power brings things into action and one thing that God will not take from you and that is your will hello he'll never take your will from you and if if you want your will to be taken you must give it y'all help me here because here was Jesus Christ I'm jumping a little bit even at a time amen that many of us may may would have ran amen from the the oncoming uh punishment or the oncoming trial you know how you want to get out of things and we think that when these horrible things come upon us that oh somehow I must be cursed that's the LIE of the devil even when you don't even understand what he's doing he's doing it Hallelujah even when you don't have a mind of what he's doing he's doing it because the Bible said the footstep of a righteous man they are ordered by the Lord hallelujah and you'll never be righteous of yourself your righteousness come from God hallelujah and just like your righteousness he gave you salvation he gave you his righteousness see when the devil tell me I ain't righteous I tell the Devil he's a lie as long as I'm under the blood of Jesus Christ I am righteous Hallelujah let me move on Hallelujah and God will always give that give you the power to choose here was a perfect man we call him Jesus and he was about ready to go to the place called Calvary he was in The Garden of Gethsemane what you hear what I'm saying he was perfect at no point in time did he ever do his own will matter of fact he said I can do nothing except I see the father's doing it and when he does it that's when I do it but there in the Garden of Eden we discover something here he was Humanity versus God and here was Humanity saying Lord I would did this cup pass from me and I don't know about you many times I would the cup pass but your Victory is in this Lord not my will but thine be done done hallelujah see we are chosen people we are special class of people we are people that God has handpicked we are elected by God we've been chosen for this hour God and through types this Bible is right hello somebody sir this is God urum is that all right yes sir if you let me let me go on now we're coming let me say it like he wants me to say it you know when it comes to the Ark of the Covenant when it comes to the holy place when it comes to the Tabernacle there's a place in the Holy place where there was a table of shoe bread I'm just going to cuz I don't want to be long there's a table of shoe bread and that table of shoe bre bread that bread was placed on what we call a golden lid and that golden lid was there to draw the attraction to the bread it was speaking that though this be bread is deity upon deity Hallelujah and you got to understand that this bread was made but it wasn't completely risen until it got got into the presence of the almighty God we call that shakina that's how this Bible is it is the bread of life but you can't even digested until shakina comes and you can read this Bible all day with an intellectual mind and you won't even understand nothing but when you read this book when you prayed up all of a sudden the the simple things that you you miss jumps up out of the pages Hallelujah sir you see now the bread is risen now the bread is fully cooked and now you can eat and enjoy oh somebody help me here see what it is this is what what even even even David said Lord thou preparest the table before me what in the presence of my enemies th anoint my head with oil and my cup runs over he did it yesterday and he's doing it again today he's taking the same bread the same word and he's preparing the table the table has been prepared where in the presence of my enemies amen but in that place hallelujah amen he anoints me see you can't work it without the anointing that's why we can't oh you know it's amazing how people of the message have killed the anointing you can't work it without the anointing Hallelujah we need the anointing of God we need the Shak of Glory of God hallelujah people you can't be afraid that's right even David said though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death I fear no evil Hallelujah where do you think you're walking now yes sir in the shadows of death everybody's afraid of the corona Hallelujah but I fear no evil I'm not saying it ain't real but one thing I know is thou art with me somebody help me here we're talking about deity and one thing I love about it I'm skipping everything but anyway it doesn't matter I'm going preach what he wants me to preach you and I must understand when it comes to this you know the Ark of the Covenant and how Moses saw it out there and how he saw the outer Court the inner court and the holies of holies amen we doing just like Israel we're seeing these things as just being pieces of furniture but understand all those pieces represented one God represented the work and manifestation of God throughout the ages Hallelujah when the Bible tells us we you know that's what we do we say candlesticks the Bible tells us Amen in Zechariah it's Candlestick not something with an s on it is only one God so when you see I'm telling you something I'm getting ready to comes to something if you just bear with me because a lot of us will be behind and I I say it like this there's a revelation there's something that God is trying to get to us we've come out of organization we've come out of denominations but where is our Revelation being placed y'all believe that so you say what do you mean brother Brooks I'm telling you by God's grace when it comes to God bringing us further we cannot stay where we are in order for us to make a Rapture we've got to come up higher is that right you and I must understand by God's grace that God has taken us through the seven Church ages seven golden candlesticks is that right then that's four if you can count that's four but seven golden candlesticks seven Church ages seven Messengers Hallelujah now the move is on for the bride I didn't say the move is on the bride I said the move is on for the bride what is it the move amen is bringing the bride into a condition where she can be made manifest Hallelujah when we quote that thing the move is on the bride you say what is the what is the bride moving h Hallelujah God is looking for a field Church a Powerhouse Hallelujah that's what this message is bringing us to not to be another church and what has happened to the people in the message we have fallen in love with the system instead of Christ we've done the same thing amen the Methodist did we've done the same thing amen the Lutheran did we've done the same thing amen the Pentecostals have done they have preached and the people believe in a system instead of the moving of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah we need to see God on the scene yes sir this message is not to be just letter this word me is meant to be lived somebody help me here oh my God Peter said listen what we've done and I always I wish I had a diagram but you know what at my church I show those seven Church ages and I said and each one of those ages typed out a church that was bound by laws rules regulations not that the spirit was bound yet it was but we needed someone to lead us out of captivity and the only one who could lead you out of captivity is this day is God himself now we look and we say well brother what are you trying to say we understand that Zachariah said the seven count he said his it was a man it was and then we see in Revelation the word of God says he was in the midst of the golden candlesticks what was it it was God divine nature God Amen showing his acts throughout the seven Church ages can God change people say we've come into Perfection but we don't need that Pentecostal stuff no more that is a trick and a lie of the devil you need everything the word restoration means to bring back that which was boss Hallelujah you can't be restored Hallelujah if you take one word out of this Bible God said your life will be taken if you add anything it'll be the plagues will be added to you Hallelujah but what are we looking for we're looking for the will of God hallelujah thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies David said I ain't scared because thou anointest my head with oil and my cup run over hallelujah what was it those seven golden candlesticks were there stick were there that candleabra how however you want to say it that manora was there to give them light and the light that this manora brought them to was the incense I'm I can't preach it all but the incense that led right before the veil now what was this incent it was the prayers of the Saints you know why I said that the denominations the seven Church ages represented the law because that's all we had rules and regulations you can't do this touch not taste not handle not Paul said we're beyond that Hallelujah when you've got to constantly tell people how to dress where to go where not to go Hallelujah that's foolishness that's not the hour we're living in we're living in the hour of the Holy Ghost we're living in a time where God is living when God can teach you right from wrong hallelujah it's in my heart is that right that Melody of Praise it's in my heart it's no longer on the pages oh God help me I had a mama who couldn't read or right but she knew Jesus see that's what matters right now people say listen brother Brooks I've really been trying to come up this ladder from Faith virtue knowledge you can try all you want to you'll never get there by your human efforts Hallelujah it takes the grace of God yes sir somebody help me it takes the grace of God to take you up there but guess what there must be some incense in your life there must be some prayer in your life you say God I want to go there you know what God says but you need to kneel in prayer I'm telling you something Mo if this thing is about ready to run you crazy it's only because you're not praying Hallelujah you've got to find the will of God for you right now is that right listen here was God he says I'm going to call my son out of Israel out of Egypt and here was Israel amen led by a prophet to come out of Egypt and here why she's crossing the Red Sea and how many of us know with the Red Sea it represented the blood of Jesus Hallelujah nothing like the blood of Jesus but that blood Sanctified them Justified them excuse me Justified them but the Bible tells me according to Deuteronomy 8 God took them out there in the wilderness to try their hearts Hallelujah you say I want the Holy Ghost well I'm going tell you something God is going to try your heart if you really want it you'll let him try you and you'll saying All Things To God Be The Glory no matter what he brings your way it'll be to God be the glory those seven golden candlesticks let me move on was Christ in the midst was the full manifestation of God God's nature manifested and revealed Hallelujah and now we who are the bride we come in a place where it looked like it was all over God had judged Leo to seea and she was found wanting weighed in the balance but she was blind and naked and didn't know it but there was a small elected group of people let me tell y'all something this this Revelation is not it's not a bundle it's not something amen you because you're a friend with this one or a friend with that one you believe one two three we going to make a Rapture no sir this is a individual walk with God and you've got to have him like that song say just like the Bible says it doesn't matter how much you know in this message it doesn't matter if you can quote the prophet of God and I want you to understand there's nothing wrong with the quote but it doesn't matter if you could quote everything even this Bible you've got to go back to the basis have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and you say well brother boo what are you trying to tell me let me tell y'all something there's so many people in this message have been birthed by a system and not by the Holy Ghost and they're trying to break BR Perfection by a system that's exactly what what the Jews did and the more they tried it was like a leopard licking his spots the more he tried to clean himself the more sinful he became you can't clean yourself it takes the Holy Spirit to sanctify you Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying sir this is what I can't stand I can't stand it because people they say they got the Holy Ghost and when the word is being preached there is no sign of Life Hallelujah let me tell you something about babies even if a baby is hungry and when they see Mama approach the room they don't say give me my knife and fork they go for it they start licking their lips they know was coming and just like mama is excited that child is excited too Hallelujah why because that baby knows he needs or she needs nourishments I don't understand people but when I come to God I I come to the church I come to be nourished I come to be fed I come to get from Jehovah jyra amen what I need Hallelujah and he's still go ahead he's still he still is Jehovah Lord and when you say by God's grace Hallelujah those incense right before the curtain let me say it like this in our day just like it was in Jesus's day we got fakers many of them carried on like the ark was behind the curtain many people are carrying on like the Holy Ghost is behind the veil but you can tell by their actions it's just an empty space hallelujah oh they can act religious they can do all the religious things but one thing about religious people they cannot recognize the word when it's right there in front of them is that right here was the word word right in front of those Sadducees and Sadducees but instead of calling him the word they called him a devil why because they were born of a system they did not know God and that's what's happening right now many are going to miss the Rapture because they have a system they know how to shout they know 15 30 minutes they know how to do it they keep it all together but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe [Music] woo and the Holy Ghost is not just a feeling the Holy Ghost will change you Hallelujah that's what the Bible said he'll change you from glory to Glory Hallelujah I hope somebody understand what I'm talking about Hallelujah here was a Living Word The Living Word right in front of them living it they saw the miraculous huh they knew what Jesus was doing but they couldn't see him they couldn't see him in human flesh they did just what Israel has always done they tried to keep God in a box is that right you see that's what Israel did even when Israel lost the Ark of the Covenant to the Philistines they felt like they couldn't win they they they felt like there was no no strength of height that's not where God wanted to remain that whole thing was about them but they was too blind to see it that God was looking for a temple that God was looking for somebody that he could use among Israel Hallelujah God even then wanted to be manifest but they thought God is just in that box can you imagine hundreds of years knowing that he's not behind the curtain knowing that the Ark of the Covenant is lost but you got to fake it that God is with you Hallelujah people let us not be blind Hallelujah you got to be a new creature you're not some patched up job you got to be born again all things must become new see denominations represented the patch up job turning over a leaf it's not turning over a leaf it's about turning a new life and I think a lot of time we take the religion and we think that's it y'all better hear what I'm saying religion won't get you there if religion was going to get you there then God would have said unto Adam and Eve that's okay I really like that leaf you God hallelujah but that leaf wasn't good then and it ain't good now y'all hear what I'm saying amen what is the will of God now I'm going go ahead on now cuz I done said enough in that area but I want you to understand when that that veil was rent hallelujah what happened you know what happened those Jews still ignored the fact that God wasn't with them and what did they do they conspired against the word and here was the very Ark of God hanging on the cross y'all hear what I'm saying here was the very word of God made manifest here was The Mercy Seat standing hanging right there and they couldn't see it but there was one man one man out of all of those who persecuted him a thief was able to look over there say Lord when you come into your kingdom have mercy on me what was that that was prayer Hallelujah he said I'm unworthy but by the grace of God have mercy on me Hallelujah that's how it is with the bride of Jesus Christ she's not puffed up she can't be prideful because she realized Hallelujah she is really unworthy and the only one amen that can make her Worthy is the one who was crucified for her hey somebody because you and I must understand hallelujah what God is doing right now he's looking for somebody who wants to do his will regardless of the persecution regardless to whether anybody knows what you're doing it ain't about your church it's about you finding the will of God the Bible says in Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let let them have Dominion see we see those things which okay we're in the image of God but his will was also to let them have them minion is that all right we're not called to be church members we are called to manifest God's Dominion y'all hear me Amen on this Earth that's why the Seven Seals were open that's why those Seven Angels Came Down in the cluster what was it it was the capping off of the church it was a new dispensation it was turning a corner it was God hallelujah bringing us up higher so let me say it like this because you and I must understand at the Jordan after Israel crossed the red seed that was the blood but now after the Wilderness experience in Deuteronomy said God tried their heart he didn't find no one worthy other than two Joshua and Caleb that's right that was the only two out of that generation he tried their hearts and they failed what was it they weren't willing to give over to the will of God and he said to them man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's God's will that we live by every word but brother Brooks how I'm going to live by every word you can't do it without the Holy Ghost Hallelujah with all your human effort you can look as righteous as you can't be and nobody can look as righteous as the Pharisees did and when Jesus came the judge of all he said you are dead men bones Hallelujah I don't want to be dead men's bones I don't want to rest upon music to bring me joy I don't want to be resting upon money or any kind of Earthly gift to give me joy you know where Joy come from the Bible said in his presence when I'm in his presence Hallelujah there's fullness of joy as long as I'm in his presence I've got joy Hallelujah you know everybody want to come to church to get joy that's temporal that's just like the woman at the well with her water pot you still working with a system God said get rid of that I can give you a river I can give you a well that will spring up into eternal life you won't have to worry about it Hallelujah wherever you are I'll be and wherever I am you will be Hallelujah because I am you are that's what Paul says I am what I am Hallelujah is that all right you know we must understand what Jesus Christ was and what he is the Bible said he was the beginning of God's creation Hallelujah is this okay so we realize by God's grace God's will was to bring in a perfect man that's why the scripture says amen that here was Adam the first Adam was a natural man he failed the human part of you is failure will always be failure sir Hallelujah but this other part Jesus said I am a quickening spirit and this quickening spirit is what the Lord of Heaven I'm going ask you a question now how do you know that the Holy Ghost is in your soul how do you know what vindications have you had to make you know that he's in your soul because once he's in your soul it erases all doubt it erases all fear oh God am I going to make it don't stop it is a union with God himself you so how do I know just like it was in that Tabernacle Hallelujah in the in the in the inner Court in the Holy place which was your spirit as long as light was in there you was fine Hallelujah but understand the spirit part of you is the emotional part but in your soul there's only faith Faith or doubt there's no emotions Hallelujah but when God goes back there and you come back there when he and you are there and he has accepted all of your sacrifice and plus your prayer hello all of a sudden the shakina of Glory come down y'all know what I'm saying when the shakina of Glory comes down then that priest began to dance hallelujah amen holy holy holy let me tell you something you say you got it and you ain't got no movement I doubt it won't even cry oh I got it I'm not saying you got to dance like me but I just know one thing when you're born again it's nothing but a mess and some of us ain't ready for it Hallelujah see but what is it you got to die to your will you've got to cross what not the Red Sea you got to cross the mighty Jordan the mighty Jordan shows you what your will is like you say that ain't will yes it is because the first thing God tried them on was the word and their will glory glory when you go in the land and you conquer don't you take nothing from them Hallelujah but aan will was still living Hallelujah and when aan chose His will over God's word it brought death not only to aen but I thought I think it's about 300 people died because of his will see you breaking the word doesn't affect just you it will affect the whole word for him that knowth to do good and doth not the Bible said it's sin I'm trying to encourage you it makes not sound like it but that's what I'm trying to do don't let the devil fool you sanctification is good enough good but it ain't good enough you need a revelation that you really got the pill of fire on the inside Hallelujah that's your kind of Glory that's what people don't understand hallelujah we're here to be living Epistles written and read of all men and all of us says Lord I Need Love how can you be behind the veil and can't love your enemy hello what was it Jesus and and y'all got me all on the other side of this thing but just like Jesus amen was there on the cross and this is one of my favorite when he said said Lord forgive them for they know not what they do as far as I'm concern it proved he was the son of God because only sons of God can truly forgive is this okay now I done skipped a lot of things but listen we don't need routine religion y'all hear what I'm saying yes sir we coming here not just here Everywhere I Go even at my own church it's a routine you sing so many songs somebody might get happy you know the musicians are sweating we're out trying to hit the right Atmosphere Trying to hit the right everything to bring an anointing in here and we're sitting up in here with our will your will he didn't sing the right songs you judging him and if that brother has laid before God and God has given him those songs to sing you're not resisting him you're resisting the Holy Ghost somebody help me here you think the musicians aren't part important you think they're here for just a show I don't Brothers I don't even know why I'm going this way but you know the thing is you must understand they're not here for a show they want the Shak they want to see God and when you resist them you resisting the Holy Ghost the day on Pentecost the Bible say they were all on one Accord and the Holy Ghost came down when we began to deny our will and says God I'm coming to church and I want to see you I'm denying my will I might feel tired but I'mma give all I got I may not feel good but I'mma give all I got God you going to know my heart because I'm going to give all I got Hallelujah I want your will to be done not just in my life but in everybody's life routine Hallelujah whom the son is set free is free indeed Hallelujah when we get to the place where just 45 minutes is going to suffice us amen it is a routine it may and it may not but Jacob says I'm not going to let you go until you bless me I didn't come to church amen to walk out like I came in I came to be blessed Hallelujah and if I'm the only one that's going to be blessed I'm going to be blessed but I want you to be blessed while I'm being blessed hallelujah oh glory to God woo God hiding in Simplicity he said they couldn't even see it and on that cross they said if thou be the Son of God save yourself said the thief to him and if thou be the Messiah come down off the cross show us if you're the king of Jews if you're the one this come down and show us see that wouldn't been showing Authority God was humbling himself you know where I'm trying to bring you I'm trying to bring you to this hour of humbling yourself this is the hour of humility this is the hour of humbling yourself y y'all better hear me go ahead because though he was Lord of all he had to Humble himself for the own coming event he had to go and pray until he prayed so he vly Amen to the drops of blood and many of us can't give him 10 minutes and we see the time approaching Jesus said this is the hour where the son of man is going to be what persecuted this is the hour where I'm going to be tried this is the hour and I know I can't make it on my own maybe some of y'all can but I know I can't make it on my own and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed Hallelujah and then the Bible said like Jacob you know like Jacob he wrestled and he wrestled and he wrestled we don't believe in that no more we forget the laws of sewing and reaping you s little you going to reap little you s much you going to give much you say oh that's not necessary I'm elected I'm chosen where so was Jacob but he had to wrestle Hallelujah so was see more but he had the wrestle and we have been so indoctrinated amen with this Holy Ghost without sensation to so many people are just absolutely dead show me the life then if you ain't got the sensation show me the life I want to see the life not just a moral life many people live moral lives but these signs shall follow them that believe you cannot strip that from the pages this book is you it's me we the fullness of the word the Bride of Jesus Christ being manifested in her day hallelujah oh come on somebody it's not enough to say what William Brandon was he did what he's supposed to do now who are you and what you come for Hallelujah you think you're going to get it riding on a e a bed of easte it ain't happening this is not an intellectual Revelation this is a born again Revelation and the only way you going to get it it's just like Jesus on Your Knees all night prayer don't even talk about it you got to have the Living Word all right y'all understand what I was just reading he said God was humbling himself in Simplicity taking on the form of death God the highest form of life become the lowest cursed of Life a sinner to die to bring forth Resurrection oh my God hiding himself in death to show himself in Resurrection God the highest form and what we fail to see and this is something brother Su said to me and I really believe it is that that revelation struck him that he had God in flesh living with him his wife was God in flesh living with him how many of us feel feel that about our wives how many wives feel that about their husbands y'all hear what I'm saying in other words she lived it so he could say that that was God that wasn't Mary that was God in flesh oh God help me that's the testimony we want that if we do come to the end of our journey amen somebody could say that was God if I ever seen God anywhere that's the closest I've ever seen he lived such a life I seen it never amen was there hypocrisy in his life he never spoke evil about no one oh come on somebody he was always blessing and blessing and blessing even though people was cursing him and cursing him and cursing him he still was balanced the love of God conquered y'all hear what I'm saying I'm not preaching you a message or a sermon I'm preaching you something that I know came from God we want his will no matter what Hallelujah remember that later her husband was a drunkard he brought his friends home said I'mma show you something my wife is a Christian cuz those men who were drunk as say never have I seen any Christians no such thing he said come on over here with me so I'm going let her know she going to prepare me meal for us and we going to sit at the table what happened he she prepared that that food Hallelujah and then all of a sudden he acted up I don't want this threw it all on the floor she didn't RAR back she broke out why you know what it was she was already anointed she didn't try to get anointed she was already prayed up y'all hear me when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard and when you in the presence of the Lord no matter what Satan brings your away he can't get beyond the fire she broke down in there must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free know there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me y'all don't hear me but let me tell you something whether you like it or not we're getting ready for a war it unless God stops it it's going to be a lot of killing pretty soon hello and what you going to do God didn't say you be lost but he did say if you fight with the sword you're going to die by it he didn't say you going to be lost he said if you fight by with you going to die about it y'all hear what I'm saying what you gonna do let me move on you got to have more than your human ability huh you got to have more than religion you got to have God in you somebody help me here we don't know how far this thing going to go if we live to see it we know that the Rapture is almost here but right now God got to try you in the fire Hallelujah you must be tried in the fire am I making sense Lord not my will but thine be done Shad right me and B go said well if he doesn't answer I'm not going to Bow Hallelujah and all along that was the will of God hallelujah let me tell you something the will of God is no matter what I got to go through I Will Not Bow yes sir God in the beginning God's will was to make man in his own image and and that is yet today help me now we must see the Living Word The Living Word the word made flesh right Paul says now we are ministers not of the letter the law but able Ministers of the spirit how can you be Ministers of the spirit and you don't even believe the Holy Ghost the minister of the spirit means that you've got the Holy Ghost and you're ministering that Spirit y'all understand me that's why you got to be careful who you got in your pull pit if that man is not living right he's ministering not the Holy Ghost but whatever ghost he's got somebody don't know what I'm talking about it is the ministering of spirit you said what do you mean listen even the Ministers of your television whatever you look at whatever you see is always ministering to you it is anointing you with something Hallelujah and you watch crazy stuff and said I ain't got no peace of mind why because confusion was ministered to you oh my God but if you and I can see there is still a prin of Peace it's not up in heaven but he in me Hallelujah the Bible we always sing that song amen when I need when I need a a a friend when I need a shout to when I need a friend I run to the Rock oh what rock the rock of Revelation that Revelation that Jesus Christ is not in heaven but he's in me he's in you is he worthy to be praised Hallelujah I know some of y'all say well if I move too much the corona going to get me if you don't move that's fine but don't let the corona stop you don't let that be the reason why you're not oh Lord listen let me tell y'all something the flu the whatever let me tell you something no can't nothing can take your life nothing until God is ready y'all hear what I'm saying you can't a even catch the flu unless God said it's okay Corona can't touch you unless God give his permission somebody help me here my point is don't fear nothing doesn't mean don't be wise I'm just saying don't fear it I'm not trying to tell you to go out there and and just you know play with the snake no the snake is a snake is you bite you Hallelujah let me move on is that all right see what I'm trying to say is we're Ministers of the spirit and and you know I look at people and they say well I've never had an experience I've had PE brother says well you know I I've just never felt it what you've never felt it let me tell y'all something how are you going to let Idol Gods beat you in that people who pray to Idol Gods say they feel it and you mean to tell me the real God comes and the presence of God comes to you and you don't feel it what is it somewhere amen there's a disconnection I don't mean to hurt your feelings but I'm trying to save you here we're trying to say listen we need to be completely plugged up and tuned into God this is the day that God is speaking to individuals Hallelujah do you think the raptures going to say oh brother brother brother Sim G say well God then told me that the Rapture is going to have tomorrow morning at 9:00 so y'all be ready that ain't it it's a shame how many more minutes I got brother I don't even know long how long I've been up here but the spirit is that comes upon the promised word for this age you understand me if the spirit of the age that came on brother Brandon he didn't even know what it was even though he preached the Holy Ghost he didn't even know it it's his wife told him said the very Holy Ghost you've been preaching that's it that's what takes you behind the veil bill whatever you do don't stop preaching the holy ghost now if God told him that not preach stop preaching it why do people in the message want us to stop oh it ain't deep enough well let me tell you something it'll never be deep to you cuz you carnal you can't perceive what's going on I don't care how listen you got people in this message they're so scared of the the the the shot and you know and all of that and you know they looking at well that's the mark of the beast that ain't the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is when you reject the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the beast well I I take a CH a shot they GNA put a chip in me don't take the shot Church fake us y'all Y you understand what I'm saying I'm trying to tell tell you now now let me go to another area all confessions must be made there is no way you're going to progress in Christ without confession not to me to him y'all hear me confession is very important if you confess your sins he is faithful and just to forgive your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness and as long as you don't confess you're not going nowhere if sin is in your life y'all hear what I'm saying but the moment you confess your sins you don't have to do pentant you don't have to wear a sad face Hallelujah you don't have to ring a bell the moment it leaves your mouth from your heart God forgives you just then somebody say well brother Brooks you know that might produce a hypocrite no it won't if it came from the heart I'm not talking about a system like the Catholic Church well I confess to the pope and I'm clean no you're not Hallelujah now listen if we confess that he is we've been in his presence and we have confessed our sins they are all blotted out in the book of his memory there's nobody but God who can do that is that right you can't forget what somebody's done to you but you can forgive them y'all hear what I'm saying oh people of God I know this is a Friday night I know some of y'all ready to go I know some of y'all tired but I am too but this must be said because that's the lateness of the hour I pray that you have not allowed your will to shut the will of God off in your life right now you're going to need it because God ain't coming back for church members he's coming back for a bride who's made herself ready whose love disappearing that's why people attack the cloud that's why they PR attack all these things let me tell you something God interpret his own word and who are we to tell God he's interpreted the wrong way is that right oh it's the truth a lot of us still believe that God going to crack the sky this big Jesus going to show up and all the planes going to crash people going to raise up out of the Grave bus drivers going to crash their cars he said it' be a secret catching away everybody ain't going to know it won't be revealed to everybody can I make just one little story and I'm going close because I want you to know where I'm going with this I I say it like this brother random told little stories and he told a story about this little girl who was a cousin to these rich girls and he liking these rich girls as denomination they were Pentecostals and they could shout and they could dance and they could they were they were in the sh shindig because they wanted the owner's son to choose them as a bride but there was this young lady amen who was a cousin to these girls and she was back in the backyard amen washing dishes throwing out the dishwasher water and he was the Rancher son she didn't approach him the message came to her and guess what he whispered to her things that the girls in the other room knew nothing about and he even told her he says listen I'm looking for someone of character and you fit the is description of woman I want the other girls didn't hear it he said listen and there's a story where it says not only did he tell her that but he also gave her money she worked but he gave her money and what was the money buy the truth and sell it not he gave her a message and that message amen was to prepare herself amen Adorn herself take what you're working see that's what people don't understand there something you and I must do if you really believe he's coming back for you you prepare yourself you work you do what you need to do Hallelujah and one thing he said around next time around this time I'm coming again so she had an idea oh when he was coming y'all hear what I'm saying the other girls didn't know it but when she he told them amen that that that he had chosen her as a bride to be his bride they mocked her they laughed at her Hallelujah but it didn't stop her from continuing to work Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying but you know if you see where he's coming from he also in that little Parable and that's what I call it that's what I call it you don't have to call it that it might be just a little story to you but I'm just trying to tell you what he revealed to me because at the second time of persecution is when he showed up somebody hear me see what we failed to see is that this persecution that we're getting ready to experience is the very season he is to show up he's coming and so is the persecution they laughed at her they made her they mocked her to scorn but she wasn't worried because during the time of their their their persecution she was standing there not trying to get ready she was in the door waiting waiting and this thing I love to hear him say she heard the sound and she saw the dust in the distance every time I think about the dust in the distance I think about that bomb dropping brother BR said before one bomb drop we'll be C but we can see it let me tell y'all something how many of us believe that the Lord is soon to come come on somebody just get give me a few more minutes I'm I'm trying to get you to understand you got to die to your own will you can't be stubborn anymore you can't y'all understand me when the Holy Ghost says move move even today brother brother brother uh Sammy and I we were coming back from with brother Simmons and here we saw right there by the hotel this man stuck in the H must have run out of gas we didn't see there was a baby in the back but the Holy Ghost says go back and help him and I said Lord if he's still there we G to help him so when I parked my car in the in in in the hotel uh parking lot I we got out of the car walked across the street there he was two white gentlemen they looked like it were shocked when we said hey do you want us to help yes he was shock and the man that was helping him was shocked here we are two white fellas and here we are black guys helping us it didn't matter we don't care about color red and yellow black and white all are precious in His sight and while we were pushing we pushed them all out of the street I mean at the busy time and the devil said somebody going to run in the back of you I'm like I don't care what you saying come on and we pushed this man up there out to the gas station he said thank you you want some money he said I don't have no money to give you whatever I said that's all right brother we're Christians he said I'm a Christian too oh what's the name of that thing he said there's a program where the people Help drug addicts and alcoholics overcome young youthful life he said you ever heard of youthful life I said yes he said I I I've graduated I said congratulations what was it God showing that man maybe he had a problem with this color I don't know but he God showed him something had I not listened to Holy Spirit I would be feeling guilty right now see people don't let the devil hinder you nothing whatever God say do it do it it doesn't matter just do it don't don't reason with it do it you must understand amen this is important right now it's very important that we follow the will of God and not the will of man y'all understand me when God say help help do do whatever you must do let me tell y'all something it ain't about where you go to church it's about where you go to church y'all hear me what happened to the unic in the desert who fed him where did he go he was under the control of the Holy Ghost and I believe with all my heart he'll be there he is there Hallelujah you and I must understand that everything is moving by the power of God I believe that with all my heart everything is moving by the power of God what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose today you choose life or death you choose will your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose oh you know I'm in the message I know brother random is the seventh angel messenger oh we've got clo we've got conduct in all oh yeah we got a down path oh you foolish people that ain't it have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and the Holy Ghost is not going to come unless the atmosphere is right huh he doesn't come when it's cold and he doesn't come when it's lukewarm whether you be in your house whether you be in your bedroom wherever you are amen God don't come down on the lukewarm prayer he wait he you got to you got to get the fire going anybody know what I'm talking about yes when that fire's going you don't even care about time hey some of us go to prayer you go to prayer with your your phone it's going to ring that's your will well I don't want to miss nothing miss it so that you can get a contact with God y'all hear what I'm saying you don't take those things that's going to distract you to prayer you go as you are simple naked it before him Lord if it takes all day for this prayer to be answered I'm going to stay right here y'all help me here now trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding right and all your ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your path now I'm going on I'm going on because I want you to understand when you come back with a bad report and y'all know the story Joshua and Caleb God is displeased I can't do it it can't be done that's the devil's lie and is contrary to the word I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me oh ain't no word in the brides vocabulary oh I can't Hallelujah you know it might be I can't can't do it by myself oh God help me you know it's the truth folks you know we look at things and I'm almost done you know I I people give you signals you know I ain't talking about the pastor either but I'm trying to tell you something if Jehovah if Jesus is Jehovah of the Old Testament how many y'all believe that Jehovah is Jesus of the new but my point is this if so what is it what what did they have and what were they able to do why things that you think you can't do when we have the opening of the word we have the revelation we see amen that God has moved us out no it ain't all finished because it overlaps there's still people amen that God want to bring out of that church age into this but understand how can you say you in the shakina and there is no life when God in the shakina this is what that y'all understand the message of the hour is the word of God that was brought out of the sinina glory it was behind the veil it wasn't just the shoe bread it was behind the veil and that word brought life it transformed a stick you understand me and all the stick had to do was lay in the presence of the son well why is it the change what what's happening that people are not changing there must be a change the problem is we're still under law we fail to see that Grace is com unto us not by power not by might but by my spirit and if it's by the spirit I need to get into the spirit I need to get into that place that's going to change me I need to be in there amen that's going to transform me that's why the devil don't want the spirit in the church no more because it is the spirit of God that destroyed the yolks and as long as we're doing this thing as a ritual that's all you're going to be is another denomination amen amen God help us hallelujah I'd rather be put out the church because I shout too much people say that's just fanaticism give me a little bit a that's fanaticism give me something other than y'all know what I'm saying how many of y'all now it's a shame but I'm going to say it just like this here most of us had a a a better time in denomination shouting and praising God than we doing now huh somebody said amen it's a truth and that's a shame cuz now we got a word that ought to make us shout oh my God Hallelujah in that day we danced to the beat my God but David didn't have a a Beat David was full of God and he saw the AR of the Covenant coming back and he began I don't need no dance I don't need no music Hallelujah y'all understand me sir you say that don't mean you got it well it mean you got something you know I'm saying at least you closer to the goal you know what I'm saying my point is amen that there's a lot of stuff I want to say I just have to do something on Sunday the Lord's willing but I'm I want you to concentrate on this the reason why we're in this mess is because Eve left the will of God she reasoned the word away and a lot of us we fail to see if God do call us holy that's what isra that's what Eve didn't see she was already perfect but he she did not see the devil says listen God hiding something from you amen you going to be this that and the other and she is let me tell you something she broke the word of God and she transformed her will from being holy to lustful and I don't know about you a lust spirit is one of the worst you can have on you all these sanctified people sir huh y'all understand me how many yes there are times we all have been trapped yeah he said oh my God help me you got to die to your will the reason why your head keep turning is because you didn't pray long enough you didn't die you didn't rot the holy spirit is not with you all over you in you and everywhere else the Bible said God put a wall of fire about me that's you got got to conquer that you know the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life that's that mudy old Jordan you got to co you got to conquer it right I'm trying to tell us something we talking about a Rapture the Bible says no unclean shall enter that City Hallelujah no unclean and it's and it's Sanctified as The Virgins were because they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had to go through a purging situation let me tell y'all something you cannot worry and be concerned about what everybody else is doing I'm closing for this message I'm trying to tell you it's going to be a few it's going to be a few and everybody that's got wearing Eagle buckles and the picture the pillar of fire all of that in their churches Don't Mean a Thing Israel had all of that and God comes in there and says hey you Whitey supplier you dead men bones who's going to warn you from the Wrath who's going to warn you to flee from the Wrath that is to come you understand me you said brother it's too hard that ain't for the bride yes it is we need a Revival and Revival is getting the trash out of your life help us Jesus your will versus God's will Lord give me Grace give me Grace To Die and right to my will Lord I want your will I want your perfect will your will is for me Hallelujah I was telling somebody I said no my life would probably be boring to you it's not boring to me I said CU really I don't do nothing I don't go to ball games I don't do nothing of the world that I know of only thing I do is go home and come back home from church and I I praise God and and read his word and yes I'm attempted in doing doing things at times but let me tell you something I've got to focus I have focused I know what I'm looking for and I'm pressing toward that Mark I don't care people I know that sounds wrong to say I don't care but my point is I'm going to make it because I have made it already and that's my attitude and my thing is now Lord my purpose is to manifest your life under this seventh seal right now this day ye yeah i' I've come here to do what relieve the Earth from her groaning y'all hear me the whole earth groans and wait for the manifestation I am here you are here to relieve the Earth from their groaning is that right this is you got to know it's true the serpents are here the seed of God is here but the seed of God listen look what the Earth is doing they're trying to control the atmosphere they're trying to control everything and the more they try to control it the more out of control it becomes why because the they they are not the inheritance they are not the inheritors of this Earth You are you and me we're the ones that that the Earth wants to obey we are the ones that the wind wants to obey we are the ones Hallelujah and you and I have seen the very power of God coming this day we've seen God move and now he's trying to find individuals that he can move in because God has never left himself without a witness Hallelujah I might sound like a crazy man but I'm serious about what I'm saying you and I must understand we've got to wake up to something because we' become too dotory we've come to a place where church has become religion the love of God is is leaking from your heart you know the love of God is not just because you can memorize scripture that ain't it the love of God is when you can fellowship with him and he can fellowship with you like I told somebody I said you know David said that he prepared the table I'm closing PR prepar the table before me in the presence of my enemy you know what happens when you prepare the table T when you invite somebody over for dinner you know what I'm saying you don't sit on this end and they sit on the other you sit right across from each other so you can do what have face to face face to face communion and fellowship this is why Jesus when he came in the clouds when he did he he came and he seven angels and and they actually you I know some you may not but anyway you saw the Housman had just saw the face of Christ what was he saying this is the hour I want to have face to face communion with you not by way of the internet not by way of the telephone I want to sit in your presence I want you to know that you're in my presence and I'm in yours and I want to talk to you when he saw that one that one girl there at the fence right he didn't say hey you over there no he got on the fence he got up to her so they could commune face to face this is what this message is all about you said oh brother Brooks what do you mean I got Facebook what I do too this is my Facebook face to face with the word of God y'all don't I don't know whether you realize what I'm saying but but by God's grace it's real I'm just telling you it's real it's another level and it's real that's all I can tell you everybody ain't going who think they going but it's real somebody going to catch or get understanding what I'm trying to say God didn't give us this message for us just to memorize it to swap and and and and and strive with one another that's nonsense I don't have time for fighting each other that's out Hallelujah this is a time for love this where you got to love your enemy really love your enemy but you got to also have a ear to hear the voice of God you got to know what you're talking about too God will tell you he'll lead you he'll guide you what if you didn't have education what if you didn't have it but God is able to lead you you got the Holy Spirit and he could tell you right from wrong let's stand I just got to see him and the Bible tells us that when he appear we shall see him as he is that's what this message came for that we could see him as he is he's not a system he's life he's the word of God he's my mother my father my sister my brother he's my everything I don't mean to break down this there ain't no acting real but I'm going tell you it's later than what most people think it's later than what we think everybody waiting for the squeeze it's coming but you better make sure you got what it takes it's got to be more than a feeling it's got to be more than churchianity it really has to be God that anointing coming down brother brother Simmons prayed for me there when I was in the back room and he's prayed for me many times but this time I felt such an anointing shoot through my back every every word that he would speak it just something took place there he couldn't I could not have felt that if he didn't have something you understand what I'm saying virtue and here was this man tired weary going through things but you know what so many people Miss God so many people think that everybody has to be the same everybody is not everybody has a different Ministry everything that sits on the table are not salt shakers or pepper shakers you got forks knives and spoons and plates but all all of that is a set to help you enjoy your meal every Ministry is different but I do believe in prayer I believe when we pray one for another y'all might I I I just say I say it like this I appreciate everybody but my salvation is hinging upon what I believe am I making sense what's going to happen and I'm closing but what's going to happen when everything is shut down y'all hear what I'm saying when it's shut down what you gonna do what are you going to draw from if your books your tapes your Bible is taken from you what you going to do how many know enough scripture to to to to keep you you know to take you over let's say like this all you need is one my scripture is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that scripture puts everybody in check when they tell me it ain't so no more Jesus Christ is the same when they say the power of God don't fall No More Jesus Christ is the same when people oh we don't get the Holy Ghost like we used to you're right many people are not getting the Holy Ghost like it used to be and therefore they're not getting it is that right don't you know this is the age of deception you got to know that you know that you know that you know and take what God gives you and run with it don't you stop don't you look to the left or the right don't you care about nothing what everybody else is doing I don't care if everybody else is living a a hypocritical life you do your best to live right before God you be that example you be that one don't let nobody I'm telling you you know I done came through a lot of stuff all of us most of us have but don't let nobody deceive you God is Not mock whatsoever you sow that which you will also reap you can't expect to reap Heaven if you re if you sewing in hell is that all right you can let us pray father God help us now I'm so thankful cuz even what you've given me I'm like Paul I don't deserve it Lord but by the grace of God by your grace we are able to stand and I I don't know who's in the audience and what is needed but father Touch
