Lord God, for those that are listening in, those that are not here tonight, Lord, we pray, dear God, Lord, that you bless the pastor of this assembly, Lord, bless the ministry, God, and may you keep him, Father. Strengthen him, Lord. Give him wisdom, Lord. We pray, God, Lord, for the power of your word tonight, Lord, that you just bless, oh God, Lord, the hearers of the word, Lord God. We pray, God, for your direction, for your leadership. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Have your Bibles tonight. Turn with me to the book of Matthew 2 through9. Then I'll let you be seated and I'll read one more scripture after that. Amen. Matthew 22 22, excuse me, 22 and two. It reads, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come." Again he sent forth other servants saying, "Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared," notice this, "I have prepared my dinner, my oxen, my fatlings are killed, and all things already come unto the marriage." But they made light of it, and they went their ways, one of them to his farm, another to his merchandise, and the remnant took his service, and instead them spitefully, and slew them. But when the king heard thereof he was wroth, he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their cities. Then say he to his servants, the wedding is ready, but they which are bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you find bid to the marriage. Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. Lord God, may you bless it in Jesus name. Amen. I want to go to another scripture there and you can hold your hands there. Uh, Revelation, Revelation 197. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready. Amen. Amen. Tonight I want to use for a little thought making yourself ready and my subtopic is the second coming of Jesus Christ. Amen. making yourself ready. I know that by now we all are hearing or hearding hearing, you know, um report about the Pope being voted in and um something seems to be kind of stirring everybody up a little bit about a thing that, you know, the prophet of God has spoke on and I'm not going to get into that too much. Amen. Probably just work with that some more there at home church. Amen. But tonight, I want to just uh deal with a little bit of um preparing yourself or making yourself ready. Making yourself ready. We see here in Matthew 22 that this king was has preparing a wedding dinner for his son. And he sent out the people to come to the wedding because he had all things already prepared. And I I like I was liking looking at this last night and the other day thinking on it and I was going to go another way but I said you know I'm not going to be long and so just share just a little portion of making yourself. You notice that this I believe is a personal invitation to everyone that has been called by God to this marriage supper. Now noticeably in any wedding there are always invitations that goes out and normally the invitation goes out to some of the people that maybe were special to that briding groom. uh close friends definitely the families and nowadays the people kind of change it up some. they select I guess just numerous of people to come because sometimes of the room that they have to be able to accommodate them and sometime it's for because it gets very expensive when you invite people you are responsible to take care of those people. And just want to paraphrase a little bit. You know, I believe God sent out an invitation. Amen. Now, we understand that it was God that did all the choosing. And we didn't choose him, but he chose us. [Music] And I like the way God do it because he wasn't partial. Thank you. He gave this invitation out to all. And giving an invitation out to all. You know that there some that's not going to come. But Jesus said, "All the Father has, they will come." Many are called, many have heard the gospel, but yet only a few can actually come. I like this because that when God calls, he not looking at what maybe the people naturally may look at because of a status or because of maybe your position. But God before the foundation of the world already know who all was going to come. Amen. As prophet God said if one play he said he said there is no way a person can come to God except he has been predestinated by God to come. That's right. Amen. Well, we hear a lot of time people say, "Well, you try to invite them to maybe to church or give them an invitation or witness them about the things of God and sometime you hear so well I come when I get ready." Well, I'm sorry. You might, but it won't be God calling you. You can't come to God when you get ready. When you That's what I say. the day that you hear his voice. True. Amen. And when you hear God's voice, you can't just resist that voice. Cuz even that voice of God, even if you not really recognizing it's the voice of God, it will do something to you. It will change your course, Lord. Amen. I I I knew what it did to me. His voice. He said, "My sheep." So only the sheep can actually hear his voice. Amen. And you don't hear it with your natural ears either. This hearing come from within you. And you only can respond to what's in you to accept what you hear even though you may can't understand it. Amen. I very doubt anybody ever called by God fully understand what is this about. But by faith you begin to move on it. Oh Lord. See, faith is a unconscious walking with God. Not really know where it's taking you, not really know what it's all about. But there's something in you begin to respond to what you hear. No preacher can put that in you. That has to be there before the foundation of the world. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, help us. I'm excited. Thank you. Not only am I excited, but I'm stirred because of what I believe that God is is bringing us to. And what he has giving us, his word in his hour, that word is a word of preparation. Amen. It's supposed to be preparing us for the second coming of Christ. I I wonder sometime do we fully understand this? This is not a church gathering of just coming to a building and Lord help us this hour putting our name on a on on a outside a message but this is actually coming back to God himself. Amen. You know, I'm learning I'm learning I'm learning some things and I I want to say something but not being critical. A lot of times that people think that if they uh this a humanistic part of people. They think that because of uh what church you think is more revalent to prepare you for the coming of Christ. We begin to just run all over the place. But you still won't find God there. That's true. Amenless. You will find God right where you left them at. Amen. Come on. Go. There isn't no certain Excuse me. There isn't no certain preacher can make you ready for the coming of the Lord. Bible say his wife she made her self. Other words, she knew what it's going to take. Amen. To prepare her for this coming. So, she began to diligently seek God on her own by revelation because she understand that this is a personal revelation of God and you alone. Oh my. We're in the closing of the hours now. We're in harvest time. And every seed must bring forth of a kind that it is. God in his own season, in his own time. I like the way that how God don't just allow things to transpire and the way that the people be looking at it, you know, and how sometime that we think that sometimes we already have it all and and these kind of things and then we find out that yet there's more. Amen. Amen. There is more that God is requiring of us. Yes, he called. And if you actually the chosen of God, you been busy seeking and and and crying out, "Lord, what must I do?" Yes. There's no time to be looking around what somebody else is doing no more. I tell them a lot of time I said I don't have time to get involved in to what everybody else is. I must stay focused. I don't have time as brother Ernest say distractions that the devil always giving the the the believers something to get their attention on what really matters. Not that he think is important, but there ought to be nothing so important that take your mind off of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. I was going to deal with that that woman in the Bible and she had lost one of her coins off of her tablet and her husband was getting ready to come and she didn't want her husband to find her one of those corner. It was it it's a message that it would have said that she wasn't true to her vows. And God say she swept that house. She tore it up. Why? Because she knew that she would be marked as a ill-famed person. The servant of God says that the church done lost all its virtues. He said it's time for us to get sweeping. Whatever we have lost as Christians, it's time we begin to get desperate about Lord, my prayer life has went away. Amen. It is it's a I know it's a spirit that done actually swept everywhere that you know it used to be a time that we knew that coming to the house of God was important. Now we use God as a convenience. When it's convenient for me to come, I'll come. And the pastor, he understands. Yes, he does. He understands that he can't make you do anything. We are only to present to you the things that God has given us. You know, that's going to prepare you, but it's up to you as an individual what you do with it. Amen. And I understand it take God to do those things. It actually takes a stirring of God to get the people back desperate again. Amen. That they'll understand this world is gone. Amen. She's doomed. I don't care what career you choose. I don't care what your goal and have it. But keep your focus on the coming of the Lord. Amen. Don't get sidetracked off money. Amen. Lord have mercy. Money don't become people of God. You know, because when you got money, you can almost they think you can buy your way in. You know, people go build their own church. They're going to start whatever they want to. They take it as, hey, you know, I can jump in it whenever, you know, come to church every 8 months, 6 months, you know, when I feel like it, at my convenience. And y'all will be glad to see me because I mean church. But let me tell you, God don't look at it that way. The way we look at it and the way God look at it is different. Amen. And God don't push to make you or to force you to get yourself ready. Here he said that he had prepared everything. Everything we have need of is here already. The opening of the book, yes Jesus, made known to us the thing that God had hid before the furnace of the world. Now he has released those things. So if the book is a open book then why are we not preparing like we alter? Amen. I really believe this Lord help us to get to that place that when it strikes us that the coming of the Lord is closer than we thought. And I know that's going to be an individual thing that God does in each and every one of us. The true church when that true church really understand by revelation that you know I've got to be about my father's business. I don't have time to be running here and running there. I must know what I'm doing. That is the Lord that's directing me. Amen. I don't have time to be running from pillar to post wondering what this got, wondering what. Let me tell you something. God got everything you need. I say God got everything you need. So don't depend on anybody else. You seek God. Amen. You know, it's hard. I understand some now, brother, to get grown people to understand the preparation of God and what they must be doing. One of the most I be the essential things that we must know that we got oil. Without that you can know all the mysteries and you can know all the thunders but without that new birth without oil in your vessel sister and brother you can even live clean sanctified lives. Matthew 25 10 virgins clean people wouldn't do anything but fire was liking oil. They were going in the message. They didn't go along to meet the bridegroom but it when he slumbered and slept say they all did. When that alarm went off the bride coming, the five wives rose cuz they had extra oil. They just didn't go to church for deep sermons, but they began to cry out to God, "Lord, I need a refilling." Lord, Lord have mercy. That didn't went away from the churches down there, you know. They think they need more mysteries. They don't know that they need fire. They need oil. They do just like those five wise a foolish virgin. They get to the very end and realize, "Oh, can I get some of yours?" And they tell, "No, go by for yourself." And they went, they get it. So while they went, guess what happened? The bron came. And those clean living people didn't make it in the rapture. Can you imagine doing all these other thing living clean and paying tithe and coming to church and yet have no oil? Wow. that would make us cry, know all the mysteries of God, yet didn't get the Holy Ghost. I was telling the people back home, you know, I tell them this. I like that brother always used to tell us long years ago way back in ' 87 89 above anything you get be sure you got the Holy Ghost. [Music] Amen. If you don't know one quotation, but if you get the Holy Ghost, if you get that giver of that word and get him personally for yourself, get a in other words, get a personalized experience with God yourself. Don't rely on buddies. Don't rely on preachers. Don't don't rely on this. rely only upon God. Most the heartbreakst thing I notice that most a pastor do when he have labored diligently before God to get a word from God cuz he's concerned about the souls of the people. That that's all it's about. I told one brother that the other day because they're console about the souls of the people and they don't want to see nobody left out. But if they don't want it, how bad do we want it? And see, when you want something bad enough, then you know that it's a price. Do you have to pay? And nobody can make you do that. You have to get a personalized stirring in your soul. And Lord, whatever it takes, whatever I must do, Lord, help me to do that. Hard to get them to pray. prayer service the most missed and I will be the one that needed the most be the one that don't never show up got things in their life going on got demonic spirits that's attacking them they need spiritual breakthroughs and every prayer night there they got a another place it said here in another writing or something like this it said that they made excuses. Excuse I got to go get a wife. I got to go get a job. It always something else. They got to do more important. This is what I tell me. I said I don't come wake nobody up to go to work on Monday, but I guarantee you you get up. Why? Because it's important to you. That boss man, he don't come to your house to wake you up. And you know if you call in too many sick time, you won't even be there much longer. But because God longsuffering, we can do him any kind of way. That's right. Which we ought not to do him like that. But yet because of the slopeess of the people and that mind setting, they just can't seem to grasp it. Without God, I won't even be able to get up. Amen. In other words, I won't be able to go to the job that I'm talking about going to if God don't wake me up. Amen. Lord help us making yourself ready. It's our own personal responsibility. It's not up to the pastor to make us ready. He has a part to do to get the word from the God and be able to give it to us. But what you do with it after you hear the word, that's on you. And only those that really fully understand, even with what's going on now in our economy and going on history, prophecy, seeing the things, you know, just materializing right before our eyes. You know what? Yeah. Well, we get st two, three days, we're right back to normal. because we don't seek out to find out what is all this really about and what connection does there have to do with me. I said I'm going to go back home and I'm going try to have a little study a little inquisiting time because you I found out by some you think people know these things they used to. They don't even know what the image of the beast is because the devil had done them bombarded our mind so much and given us so much materialistic goods. Lord have mercy. All we want to do is gain. Get get you got still want more. Get get. And know that the very thing you get is sucking the very life of God out of you. You know what causes most people not to come to the house of God? Materialistic things. They work so hard, labor, so diligently. Why not put that laboring to Christ? We It's hard to get people even to witnessing anymore. Witness. What is that? That's a foreign language. tell somebody about the second coming of the Lord. But then you know what I find out? If you don't know really what it's about, it hard for you to tell anybody else about it. True. Amen. Because when you read about it stirs you, hey y'all, we see current events made clear through prophecy. We see we wreck at the breaking of this ecumenical council movement and confederation of churches that everything is coming together a uniting time a one world religion system and what we going to be doing during that time I don't know Lord help Yes, I'm closing the Come on. Prepare yourself. Don't wait for nobody else. Prepare yourself. Understand what you must be doing as a Christian. Let's stop waiting till something happen, but let's start making it happen. God bless you tonight. [Applause] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Appreciate the word tonight. Amen. I'm just saying I was just listening to the prophet on message one more time just once more. And he says he keep stressing and every message I listen to is stressing the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You know, if we think about the great mysteries in the message, very seldom he even his his stress was on the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You listen to the message, just listen to one message after another, his stress is on you getting the Holy Ghost. And I just I I just said we listen to message after message and his stress is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but people put emphasis on other things but I it's very important just once more. He wants to see revival in the church. Wants to see the power of God in the church. Just once more Lord that's what I want. Want to see your power manifested. Want to see your glory in the church Lord. Just once more, Lord. Amen. I think sometimes Samson lost his strength. Amen. Are you with me? Samson had lost his strength to havage cut. People lose holiness. They leave. They lose the sense of spiritual guidance. They lose it. The anointing is not there. The power of God is not being manifested. Thank the Lord for brother Jimmy coming by. Amen. Stressing. Amen. Praise God. We need the gifts. We need the power of God. We need to see God in action. Amen. Amen. He's talking about in the acts of the Holy Ghost. Said when you see that prophet come out of America. Amen. That was ex Yeah. Huh? See that pope come out of out of America. Amen. Pope coming out of America. Amen. So, by the grace of God, watch out. We can see this thing coming together so fast. Shoot. Y'all see how CO hit us like that and the whole world was shut down? The commen. And I I I want I want to get with y'all again and show y'all what happened when the Lord let us come was introduced to the to the message of the hour. and what how Colombia got stirred and how South Carolina got stirred and all these churches came came about because sometimes folks forgotten that we had to the world it was the greatest ecumenical move the world has ever known was in the city of Colombia and Pope visit was the capstone of the ecumenical move. So that's why so many people came to the message. That's why so many people because they were seeing modern events made clear by prophecy. They were seeing those things manifested before the eyes. So the people were running to the message. I believe once again God can do it again. Because this thing here going to happen so quick. Praise God. It's going to be quick. If you're not in, you won't be able to get in. I was just listening to the prophet. He said, "If the door shut, you can't get in." Amen. He that holy, he said, "Let it be holy still." I know that's what the Bible said, too. But it was putting that special emphasis that the door be shut. And when that door is shut, praise God, it's all over then. And I said to come in that to that time when the door is going to be shut. Gentile time will be over. God will return back to the Jews. I was hearing just before I came to the church, they putting uh they're going to have a big move with Jews and the Protestants over in Jerusalem or something. I said they trying to do something and you know people so happy about this folk out of the US something to be proud about everybody happy happy happy people they can smile amen thank the Lord that's a good thing maybe to a lot of folks it's a nice thing not saying anything against the the man himself But before that happened that morning I read my morning scripture and it says and Satan having entered into Judas's scariot Judas surname is carried like that I said Satan entered into him at an appointed time and then that later that day I said God Is this by coincidence? Amen. We know that will happen in the end time. Amen. That Satan would enter into a man and that man would become the beast. Are y'all with me? God is doing something. When God is on the move, the enemy is getting on the move. Yes, sir. Are you with me? Yes, sir. To try to forrun the move of God. A lot of things he the prophet said, "Don't speak it. Let's just let God do it." Because if you speak it, he'll get a hold to it and do everything he can do to stop it. Amen. I said, "A lot of folks, it's like they had dreams and prophecies going forth on this church, but we spoke it. The devil do everything he do can do to destroy, you know, stop it. I'm not going to let it happen. But if if the prophecies are true, if the dreams are true, praise God, God's going to do what he's going to do." Amen. Praise God. God will do what he said. And I we got to be uh we got to know that if God going to do exactly what he said he'll do and you had to hold firm and be steadfast. Amen. Because if we look at what we see, Amen. then you'll say you you'll lose hope. But we look at what we believe and we see by faith that God is more than able. God bless you. A lot missing tonight. Different school programs, graduation, all kind of things taking place. But we're glad for you that it come tonight. Appreciate the word tonight. Let us just stand [Music] tonight. the rapture take place and they'll go on having church and the rapture didn't take place. If we're going to put emphasis on anything, you get on and cry out, "Jesus, I need your spirit. I need your power. I need the Holy Ghost. I need a I need a move of God in my life, God. I got to hear your voice. I got to hear you speak to my heart, Lord. Lord, I need you to guide me. I need you to lead me. I need you, Lord, more than anything. I need you. I need God. Let us bow our heads. Father, in the precious name of Jesus Christ, thank you again for Lord God, our brother Palmer. Lord, pray God that you'll bless him, his ministry. Lord, Father, this family, God. Lord, I just pray that you'll move here tonight, God, that those people, oh God, that they heard would get themselves in a place, oh God, that they might be ready when you call. Amen. Somebody said, "When you call, I will answer." Hallelujah. Father God, one day you'll call and I want to be ready, Lord, and and answer the call of God. God help us, Lord. Oh, what about you, brother? What about you, sister? What about you? Oh, hallelujah. God, I want to be ready, God. God, I want to do what you want me to do. Give me strength, Lord. Amen. Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, said the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Just one more. Just once more, Lord. Lord, we want to see your glory.

But Lord, I I want you to, oh God, strengthen us, Lord God, we want to move, Amen, put away, Amen, every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us and run with patience. the race that is set before us. Help us Lord to do that to begin to lay aside things. And Lord God, press towards the mark to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ. Let us do that. Lord, let this little church do that. Let every family, every home, those that are listening in press to battle for the time is short. The time is at hand. Father, thank you. Jesus name. Amen. Appreciate the Lord. Keep pressing on. God bless you. We dismiss. [Music]
