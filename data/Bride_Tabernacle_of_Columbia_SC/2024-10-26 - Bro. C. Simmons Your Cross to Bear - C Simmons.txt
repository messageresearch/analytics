presence Lord move us out of the way Lord that you may get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise and in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight I think I said Matthew Matthew chapter 16 I think we start reading in verse 24 when you got it say amen amen then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his for his soul may God bless the reading of this word you may be seated amen I like to speak I entitled this topic um something tonight I said your cross to bear your cross to bear and I started thinking about it and I started thinking about the cross and and how how Jesus said here that that if let If any man come unto me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me which means sometimes that there's going to be a cross for you and I to bear it's going to be something that we going to have to go through and we going to have to bear it and I started thinking about that I said sometimes we get so focused on our cross that we don't look at the one that saved us we don't look at the the God's provided we cuz we're so busy looking at our cross we're looking we looking at how heavy it is and sometimes your cross can get heavy sometimes your cross can be something that seems unbearable to you and I and we'll turn into scripture here cuz cuz if you think that you are alone I wanted to show you that you're not alone let's turn to First Kings chapter 19 and you see that this this this thing in life was so effective that it didn't just touch the regular people it touched even God's prophets it touched the God's anointed ones and and someone and special people as well in verse in the second verse it says um this is after Elijah had went and had the mount Karma sh down if you read your Bible you'll know if you don't read chapter 18 but where God had come down and sent his fire down and destroyed the sacrifice on the Altar and he had proved to his people that he was God and that he was still there and in verse 19 what happened uh chapter 19 we'll start at the first verse and he said and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent a messenger un Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more so and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time see Jezebel wanted to kill Elijah cuz that's what happened to her prophets well in verse three it said and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to BBA which belonged to Judah and left his servants there but he himself went a day Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree P per tree and watch this and he said and he requested for himself that he might die go ahead just imagine how heavy his cross was that he said God I want to die and I started thinking about it I said the devil can make your cross seem so heavy that you'll be like Elijah and say Lord I want to die but God wasn't finished with Elijah God had a work that Elijah still had to do in his life that and see it wasn't in Elijah control but that didn't mean that Elijah didn't come to him and said Lord I want to die see his cross got heavy he got heavy but if you read on and it said it is enough now Lord take away my life for I'm not better than my fathers see Elijah was looking at and say I I can't I can't overcome this test I'm no better than the people that were before me so if they was if they weren't strong then how strong am I if they weren't if they if they failed and how what about me I'm no stronger than them Elijah looked at them and I said sometimes you get into a place the one thing you can't do is compare your cross to somebody else's I said you can look this one and that but you can't compare your cross to somebody else is because what looks heavy to them might not be heavy to you and what looks what is heavy to you might not be heavy to them so you can't look at them and say our crosses are the same goe they have a cross cuz each one of us has a cross but that but you can't look at them and compare and say our crosses are the same cuz God gave you your your cross for you and he gave them their cross for them and sometimes you looking at them and say they cross is easy but God knew what they could take God knew what they could bear he knew what they could bear and that's why he gave your cross to you and their cross to them he he did that for a reason because he knew what would shape and mold you he knew what would make you into what what he wanted you to be he knew that this test and trial you you would overcome and survive from but he knew if he gave it to somebody else they would die immediately it wasn't something that would take long for them to die and you look at them and said sometimes all crosses are not seen many of the crosses that you may bear it it is nobody ever sees them it's something that's behind door but it doesn't mean that you don't have a cross so someone looking at you and say your life is easy easy I don't see what anything that you go through because they're trying to compare their cross to yours or you're trying to compare your cross to them and all you see is things that are going on and all you see is God blessing them but you don't see the cross but that doesn't mean the cross ain't there that doesn't mean that that someone ain't going through their cross and they carrying that cross and and they're going through life with that cross on them but God said I never put more on you then you can bear that's what he said so when you looking at you sometimes you done looked at the cross and ain't looked that God and provided way amen you ain't looked at God and said I'll never leave you nor forsake you so if he gave you the cross he got a way for you to go through it he got a way for you to carry that cross he'll give you strength that you may make it with that cross he said I'll give you the cross but if you don't take the cross you won't get a crown amen if you don't take the cross you won't get a crown and sometimes you get ready to say I'm ready to cast the cross off I'm done carrying this cross I'm done carrying this thing I'm done dealing with this but you ain't really overcome it yet but if you ain't overcome it God has send you right back there for you to pick it back up so that you can come through it and when you come through it then he said hey but guess what when you come through that one there's another one there's another one but it's going to be different but there's another one that don't make it any easier it just proves that God he said he's not s yesterday today and forever so if he can bring you through this one he can take you through the next one and said and I want to finish reading here he said and he and Elijah as verse 5 and he said as he laid down lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat see God didn't leave Elijah alone he got to the point that God heard him he said I'm not going to leave your on I got to come and I got to give you something to take you through this cross I got to give you something that's going to sustain you from the cross and in verse six he said and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the co and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid down again and the angel of the Lord came again this the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto wh the Mount of God see God gave him something because he knew the journey was coming he knew how heavy the journey was but when God gives you something to Feast on it'll carry you through amen and all you have to do is believe on one word amen it it you don't have to sometime you say I need to know what's in the whole Bible but I heard someone said I said you can they said the word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee but if you ain't got no words in there am then then then you can't you can't dwell on nothing to carry you through you can't lean on nothing and look back and and know where God what what God has said so you got to have something in you so I can lean back and say Lord you said in your word and I believe it and that's it and see when you got something that that's why he says study to show thyself approved you got to study you got to take time with God and read his word and so that you can have something to lean on when the Devil comes to attack you when the Devil Comes cuz he going to come if you live long enough he going to come and and when you when you live long enough you'll have something to say Lord I know that you did it and I know what you done and even though I Stumble I can't fall because you got me even though I Stumble I know that Lord you're right here to keep me with this cross this cross that I'm bearing see I thought and I read in the scripture when you go down and you see Jesus you'll see that Jesus didn't carry his cross they called Simon out of the crowd to carry the cross see Jesus KN God knew how much Jesus could bear and he knew that Jesus had to die on the cross he couldn't die before he got to the Cross he couldn't die before he got on that hill and shed his blood so he had to get God allowed someone to come out and say you will carry this cross and see sometimes God just waiting on you to to stop looking at the cross and said lord I can't handle it amen lord I can't deal with this no more but I know that you can I know either whether you take the cross off of me or you give me the strength to Bear the cross I know that you can do something for me that I can't do for myself I know that you can I can lean on you and depend on you to do something for me that I can't do for myself amen see that's what he wants you to do get to that point and sometimes he allowed the CR the cross to intensify and get heavier and you to get weaker so that you realize that you can't do it yourself and when you realize that you'll start looking up you'll start look to the heels from which cometh your help see see what that's what God sometimes got to get you to the point of he's got to get you to the point that you're not looking at it that I can do it that I'm strong enough that I'm I I I if I go and do this I'll be able to do what I need to do and I'll be strong enough to carry this cross amen that's why he gives you the cross cuz he knows that God wants you to realize that he's a provider that he's a savior he's a deliverer but he's a keeper and as you said if you want to be kept but you got to come to the Lord sometimes and say Lord keep me say Lord I want to be kept you got to make a positive declaration to the Lord get down on your knees and say Lord I want to be kept Lord I want I know what you done for me and Lord I want to be kept Lord I know what the things that you've done I don't want to go back to where I was cuz you never go back to where you was you go back further than where you was am you never return to the spot that where you was most time you go back worse amen so you got to come to God and say Lord I want to be kept Lord I lift my hands and say Lord I want to be kept see God wants to hear you say it Lord I know what you done but don't stop there amen Lord I I know what you done and and the devil is coming to attack me now cuz now I got a cross to bear the devil will make it seem like when you doing what you want to do that you ain't got no cross at all cuz he make it easy well actually he don't make it easy cuz you got to work to get to hell you got to do a whole lot of stuff to get to Hell amen and so it's not an easy road to get there he just make it seem like it is cuz you get to the point that you just say I don't care that's a dangerous place to be that's a dangerous place to be and if you on that precipice where you you just trying to decide what you want to do sometimes you got to wake up and say I actually do care amen you got to wake up and say I actually care where I spend my eternal destination see it's not about whe what I do today and tomorrow it's whether what you doing while you're running this race cuz when you get there God just going to ask you what did you do with the life I gave you amen come on what did you do uhhuh see just because just because you think it's it's so easy to do this yes when you come to God there are things that the devil is going to try to do but God will be right there with you to carry you through it that's the whole point of going to him I want to read something he said Prophet God said the church needs tonight not a soft hybrid thing or soft or flabby like the church is just make a conf be baptized and you're a Christian to be a Christian is self-denial deny yourself and take up your cross follow me daily today is so soften that people call themselves Christians when it used to mean death to confess Christ you had to depend on him daily for everything you had need of and I think we get to a point in in the world and how the world is going that eventually you going to have to depend on God daily amen God has been gracious and merciful to allow us to do things and to do things and you think that I'm doing this on my own but it's only because of the grace of God and you can't forget that that lord it's your grace and mercy that I'm able to go places and do the things with freedom amen because there are places in the world that they don't have that freedom they don't have that freedom where they can just do what they want to do where they can go to church and it be a great thing and easy thing there are places where they have to be in secrecy amen will it come a point in time for for us to be like that we don't know that's why take advantage of what God has given you right now each and every time you come to the house of the Lord take advantage of it amen he said that same God lives today I know that's true and he's just a great he's just as great today as he was then if he ever was God he still is God if he ever was God he still is God but if he isn't God then he never was God because he's a god of of the whole because he's a god of the whole human race so what good what good does it do to talk about a god of Abraham if he isn't the same God today what would it do to talk about a God who could open up the Red Sea if he couldn't for his children to escape if he couldn't do the same thing today what about a God that could raise a dead man out of the Grave if he can't do the same thing today so what is God if he's not the same today as he was yesterday what is that God and say what good does it do to give your canary bird fine seeds and vitamins to grow good to grow good strong bones and wings and Feathers then keep him in a cage how is it how is it going to use them what good does it do to teach a Bible of some great God said what good does it do for you for for you to to say all these things of what God is and God doesn't do them that's no better than anybody else's but it has to come to a point that you realize that God wants to do what he said he would do and God has to show that I am God that I am God and I change not that I am God and I change not so if I said I would do it I have to do it because then I wouldn't be God I wouldn't be God and said he said looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and then sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God see God endured the cross and ask the question what are you enduring what are you enduring on your journey what are you what are you en enduring on this journey that God has given you see without your cross you won't get a crown amen Jesus even had to go to the cross and and see he showed us he was the ultimate example of what he took he was the ultimate example of what he took but he said I'm going here so that you don't have to I'm going here that all you have to do is come to me repent of your sin be baptized and and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and and live a clean life as I as I ask you to and live for me and then you can make it in it wasn't a whole lot of things that he asked us to do but he wanted us to come and said said Lord the cross that you give me I want to take it all the way Lord whatever cross you give me I want to carry this cross because you gave it to me that I may make it in I take this cross because you died on the cross I take this cross because this cross is building me so that I can get my crown one day you don't look you looking at your cross but you're not looking at the Finish Line you're looking at the you looking at the the journey but you're not looking at the finish line and when you start looking at the Finish Line you realize a lot of things in your life won't mean a lot as much as they do when you're looking at the finish line and where you so the question is where do you want to go the question is where do you want to end up the question is what do you where do you see your life when you see the end when you cuz you sometimes you might not think of where the end of my journey may lead you might just be going through each and every day and say I got a long time but that ain't promised to you tomorrow tomorrow ain't promised you to you but if if it was the end today where would you be amen and so when you start thinking of that you start looking at the cross that I'm carrying you start looking at where I am you start looking at what's happening to me and what's wrong with me and what's going on with me and all this started thing and you started looking at what's the real purpose of life what's the real purpose of what I'm doing what what is I'm doing that's going to lead me to where I want to be and you have to make that decision for yourself I can't make that decision for you I can't lead you and say and as much as anybody can tell you one day you have to make the decision for yourself and when you make that de decision whatever decision you make is is going to have an impact on the rest of your life it's going to have an impact on what you do each and every day whether you go here and you take this or whether you go with your friend some days or whether you come and say you know what I'm going to church tonight and it's not because it's not because somebody making you it's because now you want to cuz you made a decision that Lord the cross is not not important I just want to make sure where I'm going I is where you want me to go Lord what I'm doing is what you want me to do you'll give me strength to Bear the cross you will give me the strength that I won't have to look at the cross I can look and say Lord I know that you're going to take this cross and you're going to provide a way that I can go through this cross I can carry this cross and I can reach the Finish Line amen and I can go on and Lord you can do the work that you promised that you would do Lord I can believe that Lord you would do what you said you would do so the cross is not something that I'm looking at no more more I'm not wondering how I'm going to make it day to day cuz I know that you got the days I'm not looking at whether you going to heal my body cuz I know that you got that and you said that you would so by your strikes I am healed so I can look at it and keep going I'm not looking at the sickness no more if that's my cross I'm not looking at whether I going to live right no more because if that's my cross because I can look at it and say Lord you'll give me the strength to overcome that you'll give me the strength to overcome whatever I may face each and every day whether it's depression anxiety Lord you will take that away from me amen that I can overcome it that this cross I'm not focused on oh how anxious I am I'm looking at you and say Lord you delivered me amen whether I see it today or see it tomorrow or the next day Lord you delivered me amen and I can confess that Lord you delivered me Lord you delivered me Lord I I'm not going to deal with this amen and see that'll calm you all the way way down you start calling on Jesus and and he come in the room and come on the scene that'll calm you all the way down it'll get you to a place you say you know what eventually the devil say you know ain't no use to me being here cuz every time I come in the room they call on Jesus every time I come to bother them they call on Jesus am and so that he can't be there while God is there light can't shine with Darkness Darkness and Light don't mix together so something has to amen it's whether you want it or not sometimes you have to make the positive confession Lord I want you here Lord I want you in the room with me Lord I want you in my life each and every day Lord I want you every night that I'm awake in the Midnight Hour Lord I want you here amen God want you to confess Lord I want you to be with me Lord I need you to be with me I don't want you I need you to be with me Lord I need you to be the keeper that you said you would be Lord I need you to be the healer that you said you would be Lord I need you to be the deliverer that you said you would be and Lord you said it in your word so I can hold on to it I can believe it that I'm no longer looking at this cross that I'm bearing I'm looking at you I got my eyes solely focused on you and knowing that you will bring me through knowing that you'll Deliver Me Lord I know that what you can do and I'm trusting you to do it I'm trusting you to do it and see that's when you start to open up your mouth and you realize when you start to pray your prayers stretched on your prayers done stretched on because you realize God is doing something you get happy with your prayers you get you start to realizing what God can do I wanted to read something in First Kings 19 and verse n because it was a continuation of the story and I meant to read it earlier and in verse 9 it said and he came thither into a cave Elijah was still out there in the wilderness he came thither un the cave and loded there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what Dost thou hear Elijah and I started thinking about it I said what is God asking you what Dost thou hear in the place that you are God may have something that he wants you to do so he asked the question what does thou hear God had a work for Elijah to do but Elijah had gotten so low he had gotten so low even after God had sustained him and he went through went through the 40 days out in there and he had ate and train God had to come to him and say what does I hear so it's a reminder that sometimes God got something else for you to do he he wants you to he he done show you that you can depend on me you can you can trust me you don't have to look at the cross that you bearing no more and he asked you what does thou hear and I I said God is sometimes he's waiting on us to move he's waiting on us to take up the Baton and you say you know what Lord I'm not going to stay where I am today I'm not going to continue to look at my cross I'm not going to continue to to look at what I'm going through I'm going to go on I'm going to move forward I'm going to take that step and I'm going to trust in you to do what you said you going to do and that's something that it's not until it becomes clear to you that you can actually do it no matter how many some how many times somebody tells you but when it comes real to you for yourself things will happen I I I I can you can trust God and believe that things will happen and there's many testimonies that can tell you that when you latch on the truth faith when you when you get an understanding a revelation all it takes is one thing for you to believe you only got to take God at one word and God to do do things that you never thought that was possible God to do the things in your life that you never thought was possible God to take you and deliver you from things all you have to do is believe that God will do it all you have to do is believe in God's word and he'll do the miraculous he'll deliver you from things and and allow you to overcome things that you never thought of he can give you things and give you insights that you never thought you would have he allow you to if you in school and got a test God allow you and give you the insights on stuff that you didn't understand until you took the test you were studying night in and night out and people could have explained no matter how many and then it come it clicks as soon as you take the test just because you prayed right before you took that test and sometimes I remember in my life I had to pray and said Lord I need this amen and it wasn't necessarily for it was for me I ain't going to tell no one truth but it was because I knew others was praying for me and I said said Lord I I'm they praying almost more than I'm praying that I make it through but I got down I said Lord this is what this is what I need and I need an understanding because it's one thing to take it and and to do it but if you don't get understanding sometimes it doesn't help you it doesn't help you but you got to believe that Lord you the god that can do anything amen amen you're the god that always can show up on the scene for me and sometimes God will show you that I'm still God but you got to come to and ask him Lord I need you to give me understanding Lord I need you to give me wisdom Lord I need you to do it for me I I know you can do it for a lot of but I need you to do it for me so that I can have the testimony of what God has done am so I can have the testimony and tell others how good God is and and realize that I didn't do it myself but it was him that did it for me it was him that did it for me but I'm stepping out on faith and say Lord I'm taking you at your word Lord I'm taking you at your word if you said that you would do it for me I believe that you would do it for me and Lord and Pastor was saying lately he was telling me that sometimes you got to tell your testimony so others can say hey he did it for such and such he can do it for me Lord if you gave him the grade that he needed to pass the class you can do it for me Lord if you gave him the grade that he needed to get his scholarship that's what you can do it for me yes Lord say you got to tell the testimonies of what God has done and when he do it don't forget to tell God thank you don't forget to come back down and say Lord I Thank you for what you just did for me and give the testimony no matter what it is of what God has done amen because it might be something small to you but it might be great to someone else amen it might be something that God has done and you think it's so small but God wanted you to share it so that someone else could believe and continue to have faith in what they believe in God for and continue to have faith and what they're believing God for because maybe in that moment in time it's just a little repri off of that cross that they're bearing it's a little reprieve for them to continue to trust God and say Lord I can turn my eyes and look to the Hills from which cometh my help because I realize that it's not me but it's you that's going to help me carry this cross and when and when I come to the to the end of this cross I know it's another one but while I'm in this one Lord I need I thank you for the encouragement that you're giving me to carry this one on I thank you for the blessings that you're doing and the word that you're speaking to me so that I can continue to go on I can continue to face this and I can continue to Bear the cross that you given to me cuz one day I'm going to realize that all the crosses was there and one day when I I'm not going to look at all those crosses if I get a crown am I'm not going to look at that Journey someone I heard someone say recently they said you never know if you make it over there said you know everybody say oh I'm going to shout and all this one person said if I make it over and I hear well done I'm just going to faint cuz I made it over I said you never know but all you want to do and all you want to believe is Lord I want to live a life that I can make it there am I want to live this life in such a way that there's no doubt yes Lord that there's no doubt now the devil may knock you down today and tomorrow but there's no doubt that Lord I carried this cross that you gave me and Lord I even though I struggle sometimes but I carried this cross cuz you gave it to me and when I get there I can lay down this cross I can lay down this cross and all I want to hear you say is well done Lord say but you got to get to the point that Lord I need to help with this cross Lord I need you to bear this cross for me and however God decide to do it that's how he decides to do it cuz some times he'll say I'm not going to take the cross I'm just going to give you strength yes I'm not going to take the cross I'm just going to give you a word so that you can trust me that that I'll bring you through when you carrying this cross see but God has his way cuz he knows how best to help us he knows how best to help us build and help us make it through what he's given us am [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord
