[30:22] book of Philippians by the grace of God
[30:25] Philippians 1.
[30:28] it won't be long tonight
[30:33] Philippians 1.
[30:39] you gotta say man
[30:42] and it reads Paul and timotheus the
[30:46] Servants of Jesus Christ to all the
[30:48] saints in Christ Jesus which are at
[30:52] Philippi which with the Bishops and

[31:09] making requests with joy for your
[31:12] fellowship in in the gospel from the
[31:15] first day until now being confident of
[31:17] this very thing that he which hath begun
[31:21] a good work in you will perform it until
[31:24] the day of Jesus Christ even as it is me
[31:27] for me to think this of you all because
[31:31] I have you in my heart in as much as
[31:34] both in my bonds and in the defense and
[31:38] confirmation of the Gospel ye all are
[31:40] partakers of my grace my God it'll bless
[31:43] your reading of his words you may be
[31:44] seated tonight by the grace of God just
[31:47] for a few moment moments tonight I just
[31:49] want to talk to you on a little
[31:51] something I just just kind of just
[31:53] talk to you for a moment and I entitled
[31:56] it of finished work amen
[31:58] a finished work you know the things that
[32:01] God does God never started nothing that
[32:05] he wasn't able to finish
[32:07] God never saved a person and then
[32:10] tomorrow say I have to lose that person
[32:13] but I believe that you know just like he
[32:15] says in the scriptures all the fathers
[32:17] given him will come
[32:19] and he never lost one
[32:21] so that's the Assurance you know it's
[32:23] something about walking walking with the
[32:26] confidence knowing that you know the
[32:29] thing that God uh started he's able to
[32:31] finish
[32:32] you know Paul you know a lot of times in
[32:36] the scriptures he was trying to convince
[32:38] the people or to persuade them that you
[32:41] know God is able to take care of you
[32:44] God is able to handle your situation
[32:46] your trial God is going to take care of
[32:48] you
[32:49] because there's a lot of times we find
[32:51] ourselves constantly encouraging the
[32:53] people that that you know we struggling
[32:55] sometimes at the small things we we um
[32:59] struggle sometimes that happen to Faith
[33:00] in the in the smallest things to
[33:03] understand that God is he is God he's
[33:05] he's able to take care of it I says you
[33:08] know it's but when you're walking
[33:10] with the confidence I was sharing the
[33:12] other day I said you know the God we
[33:14] serve in your situation your trial all
[33:18] in a moment God is he's always able all
[33:21] in the moment God can turn that thing
[33:23] around
[33:24] and he could have been turned around
[33:25] whenever he whenever he desired to turn
[33:28] around but sometimes he lets things
[33:30] linger just to see our reaction
[33:33] sometimes he lets things linger because
[33:35] we got things that in us that he's
[33:37] trying to work out work out of us so at
[33:40] that time when when the time is right
[33:42] God can God will step up and he'll turn
[33:46] that thing around
[33:47] so a lot of times we we got things we
[33:49] struggle we battle with we face with you
[33:52] know and sometimes they seem to be
[33:53] lingering but are we seeking God to ask
[33:57] God sometimes what Lord what do I have
[33:59] to do
[34:00] God am I doing something to stand in the
[34:03] way of my Deliverance of you delivering
[34:05] Lord am I if I'm doing something or or
[34:08] isn't in a certain place God what do I
[34:10] need to do and sometimes that's what God
[34:13] has taken us to because he knew the
[34:15] whole God know the whole time but he
[34:16] wants to get you to that place the way
[34:19] you say Lord what do I have to do come
[34:21] on and sometimes we already know those
[34:23] things amen but we find I said you know
[34:26] you try to encourage people the people
[34:28] struggled a lot of times you know God
[34:30] can do things great Deliverance bring
[34:32] great Deliverance in a person's life but
[34:35] all the all the journey they're still
[34:37] struggling with the very beginning the
[34:39] the root the foundation they very
[34:41] they're very struggling with that
[34:43] sometimes all through their Journey the
[34:45] devil keep bringing things to them and
[34:47] then they doubting whether they saved or
[34:49] not doubting whether they've been filled
[34:51] with the Holy Ghost or not but what it
[34:53] is that's because the devil keeps you
[34:55] into that place he don't want you to get
[34:57] it settled within your spirit to
[35:00] understand that look I gave it to God I
[35:02] gave my life to God I belong to him
[35:05] so I'm not going to struggle at these
[35:07] small things I'm gonna go on to the
[35:08] deeper things in God you know well we
[35:11] find that we find that many times I says
[35:13] you know God God is able God is able to
[35:16] finish your work I like how Paul said in
[35:18] many of places and we won't be able to
[35:20] go there for for the time's sake tonight
[35:22] but Paul in many places he was like I
[35:25] like how he was talking about in uh
[35:26] Romans 8 and he was talking about you
[35:29] know the God that foreknews he already
[35:32] predestinated us already called us
[35:34] already Justified us and glorified us
[35:36] you know he's going on talking about
[35:38] those things so he began to say you know
[35:40] just encouraging the people that you
[35:42] know who can lay in charge of God's
[35:44] elect it's God as I was sharing the
[35:46] other day I said you know we talk about
[35:47] the accuser the devil is accusing you
[35:50] but even though the devil is accusing
[35:52] you don't you know that God is your
[35:53] lawyer God is your lawyer God is the
[35:56] judge and he's sitting on the jury board
[35:59] I was sharing with them that the other
[36:00] day I said God is your loyal and he's
[36:03] also your judge and he's also the jury
[36:07] not the accuser the devil is up there
[36:09] accusing you day and night right but you
[36:12] going into a case that you already won
[36:15] yes you are already guilty you guilty
[36:18] from the womb you're guilty you came
[36:21] into this world sinner
[36:23] born ready to die right
[36:26] but God has already paved the way he's
[36:28] already made a way for you
[36:29] he already foreknew you he already
[36:31] Justified you called you come on
[36:33] glorified you know all these things
[36:35] that's why Paul said I'm persuaded that
[36:38] neither life nor death Angels
[36:40] principalities Powers any of those
[36:42] things can separate us from the love of
[36:44] God because it wasn't my choosing that
[36:47] chose him but it was him that chose me
[36:50] I might have struggled with that growing
[36:52] it in my life but somewhere along the
[36:54] line it had to drop down and register in
[36:56] your spirit that I belong to God I don't
[36:58] belong to the devil
[37:00] I was born into this world a certain
[37:02] place in certain conditions but I I
[37:04] wasn't of this world
[37:06] I was in the mind of God God foreknew me
[37:10] and that's why you know it was something
[37:13] inside of my heart could say yes Lord
[37:15] or say Amen to the word or something
[37:17] inside of my spirit can register to the
[37:20] to the supernatural things
[37:22] because I was a part of him I didn't
[37:24] recognize it but something quick and uh
[37:26] down in your spirit and that's what it
[37:28] that's what's got to happen it's got to
[37:29] go more than just uh uh to the
[37:32] intellectual uh Place realm of your mind
[37:35] because that ain't gonna that ain't
[37:37] gonna give you that quickening power
[37:38] that ain't gonna give you that
[37:40] overcoming power but something something
[37:42] supernatural has to take place
[37:44] to Quicken you you know Peter and all
[37:47] those they can uh be with Jesus with all
[37:49] the miracle signs and wonders and even
[37:51] he was trans figured in front of them
[37:53] and they said because he told him Peter
[37:56] said I believe that you're the Messiah
[37:57] and all these things and and Jesus told
[38:00] him I'm he they can see that they can
[38:02] see all the miracle signs and wonders
[38:04] but yet when it came down for him to go
[38:07] to Calvary or came down for them to
[38:09] confess him if it was going to cost them
[38:12] their life they couldn't do it
[38:14] and the reason why they couldn't do it
[38:16] because they didn't have the spirit of
[38:18] God yet come on the Holy Ghost hadn't
[38:20] come yet but when the Holy Ghost come
[38:23] it's more than just you knowing him just
[38:25] from uh that uh physical standpoint or
[38:29] being all that but when the Holy Ghost
[38:30] come he come and baptize it's come on
[38:33] the inside of you and baptize you that's
[38:34] him in you living his life through
[38:37] you're no longer Twain but you and God
[38:39] become one you can't deny him because to
[38:42] deny him you have to deny your own self
[38:44] right and for him to deny deny you he'd
[38:48] have to deny himself because you are
[38:50] part of him right come on I believe that
[38:53] with all of my heart that's why it says
[38:54] you know after the day of Pentecost that
[38:56] same one that denied him now can stand
[38:59] up and says men and brother and these
[39:01] men ain't drunk as you suppose but this
[39:03] is that come on a revelation had opened
[39:07] up that they could not only just read
[39:09] the letter of the word but they could
[39:11] see it through the eyes of the spirit
[39:13] and recognize they can see the very word
[39:16] being manifest before them they knew
[39:19] where they were in the scriptures and
[39:21] don't you know the people the the the
[39:23] Church of that day the Pharisees and all
[39:25] those got mad with Peter and all those
[39:27] because of what it is they was they had
[39:30] they had the scriptures they had all
[39:31] those things but they couldn't see it
[39:33] when it was manifested before them they
[39:35] couldn't put it in its place but Peter
[39:38] and all those they knew exactly where
[39:40] they were in time they knew exactly what
[39:41] they were expecting and that's why he
[39:43] said they said men and brother what
[39:45] shall we do he says repent come on now
[39:47] it's the number one thing wasn't it the
[39:49] repent and be baptized every one of you
[39:51] in the name of Jesus Christ for their
[39:53] mission of your sins and he said you
[39:55] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[39:57] it's a promise come on and God don't God
[40:01] can't break his promises
[40:03] that's one thing you try to convince God
[40:05] tell the people God can't break his
[40:07] promises
[40:08] God God keeps all his promises
[40:11] the work that he started he's able to
[40:13] finish
[40:14] what hinders a lot of time God for
[40:16] moving is your unbelief
[40:18] you'll doubt you know a lot of times you
[40:21] know the Bible says who have to believe
[40:22] in our report and whom is the arm of the
[40:25] Lord reveal come on God when he came
[40:28] when Jesus came you know the prophet of
[40:30] God talking about him being God's
[40:31] Masterpiece he whipped the devil on
[40:34] every on every circumstance every every
[40:36] situation God had something for the
[40:38] devil on every Circle every situation
[40:40] God has something for the devil didn't
[40:43] he he had the word was going to exposing
[40:46] the word was going to fight your battle
[40:48] in every situation and that's what I
[40:50] like I said God it ain't no temptation
[40:52] that ever came that you ain't already
[40:54] not handled you ain't already you know
[40:56] it's nothing new Under the Sun all these
[40:58] demons we fighting come on God has
[41:00] already conquered them for us he's
[41:03] already uh Victor we're already
[41:04] Victorious because the God has already
[41:06] whipped the devil
[41:08] ain't nothing new Under the Sun say God
[41:10] you ain't never any is not nothing you
[41:12] say God ain't never seen before God no
[41:14] he knows all those things don't he come
[41:17] on but we don't stumble at those things
[41:19] that's why I like how David well he's
[41:21] talking about the Lord is my shepherd
[41:23] you know because he's seen some dark
[41:25] nights didn't he yeah though I walked
[41:27] through the valley and the shadow of
[41:28] death he seen those dark nights but he
[41:31] said he didn't have to be worried about
[41:32] it walking through those dark nights
[41:34] because God was with him because he knew
[41:37] that the same Shepherd that lead him in
[41:39] the day is the same one that leading him
[41:41] in the night
[41:42] the same one Hallelujah that that that
[41:45] that Shepherd that Good Shepherd that
[41:47] knows the sheep and calleth them by name
[41:49] and lead them out he's going to lead me
[41:52] through those dark hours he's going to
[41:54] lead me through those lonely nights you
[41:56] know one thing about it when that Lord
[41:58] first saved me I learned early in the
[42:00] Christian journey I I said that you know
[42:03] like the scripture says when your mother
[42:04] and father forsake you the Lord will
[42:06] take you up I learned early in the
[42:08] Christian Journey that there is no
[42:09] friend like the Lola Jesus when you
[42:12] didn't have nobody that want to talk to
[42:13] you nobody that wanted to be your friend
[42:15] I learned early in in those hours that
[42:18] Jesus was right there with me all the
[42:20] time that he was my friend when I don't
[42:22] have nobody that like they say I
[42:24] convinced to I learned early in the
[42:26] Christian Journey that I convinced the
[42:28] God and not only will he hear hear me
[42:31] and just listen to me but he he was able
[42:33] to take care of all of that he was able
[42:35] to let me know that look cast all your
[42:37] cares upon me because I care for you
[42:40] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[42:42] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[42:44] light I learned that early in the
[42:46] Christian journey and I'm even learning
[42:48] it now that God I got to release these
[42:50] things these heartaches this pain this
[42:53] struggle these battles all it is is the
[42:55] devil trying to stop you he don't want
[42:57] you to praise God he don't want you to
[42:59] give God thanks he don't want you to be
[43:01] happy righteousness peace and joy in the
[43:03] Holy Ghost he want to take all those
[43:05] things away
[43:06] but the understanding that God I don't
[43:08] have to carry them because you already
[43:10] carry them for me my job is to come in
[43:12] the house of the Lord with a smile on my
[43:14] face with Thanksgiving in my heart to
[43:16] praise God that's my job come on no
[43:19] matter what I'm faced with body reckon
[43:21] with pain come on he was wounded for our
[43:25] transgression bruised fried iniquities
[43:26] the chastising of our peace was upon him
[43:29] and with his stripes we are healed and
[43:31] that's in the face of any demon
[43:34] anything any any sickness any other
[43:37] bring the devil bring all these spirits
[43:39] and that's all it is give it whatever
[43:40] kind of name they want to give it ain't
[43:42] nothing but a demon a devil a Tormentor
[43:45] from the pits of Hell come to torment
[43:47] you but God has delivered us from the
[43:49] Tormentor you don't have to be tormented
[43:52] but his righteousness peace and joy in
[43:55] the Holy Ghost and that's what I want to
[43:57] live in that's what I want to dwell in
[43:59] Hallelujah but the devil don't took the
[44:02] joy from people that took the joy and
[44:04] the peace and all those things got your
[44:06] word blood pressure up nerve shot
[44:09] that's the world we living in men's
[44:11] hearts are failing for fear but God is
[44:14] the one he's the one to fix that heart
[44:17] he's the one to take that shaky place
[44:19] and make it stable
[44:21] he's the one to take those lonely nights
[44:23] and make them nights of rest come on
[44:26] peace be still
[44:29] the wind blowing all those things the
[44:31] Bible said it was crying for fear but he
[44:33] says peace be still
[44:35] I don't know about you but sometimes in
[44:37] those nights I whisper to myself peace
[44:40] be still
[44:41] Hallelujah be still
[44:44] God is here I'm gonna let God work
[44:47] I'm gonna let God take care of that
[44:49] situation when I don't know what to do
[44:51] I'm gonna give it to God let God handle
[44:53] it because he's already he's already
[44:55] done it hallelujah oh Jesus it's a
[44:58] finished work
[44:59] come on the problem like I said is why
[45:01] God sometimes oh oh oh it ain't that God
[45:05] can't finish a job God never started
[45:07] nothing he couldn't finish
[45:09] it ain't that that he's a failure it's
[45:11] just our own belief you know I thought
[45:14] about Israel God took Israelite to take
[45:16] them in didn't he
[45:17] he brought him out to take him in now
[45:19] the god that brought him out with all
[45:21] these Mighty signs and wonders
[45:24] he was able to take them in wasn't he
[45:26] it wasn't them that brought themselves
[45:28] out but it was God that brought them out
[45:31] and that same God that brought him out
[45:32] was able to take him in
[45:34] but they stumbled along the way didn't
[45:36] they through unbelief always complaining
[45:40] always whining them talk about what they
[45:43] don't have
[45:45] and how it used to be yeah how it used
[45:47] to be when you was in bondage but now
[45:50] God has set you free and the devil still
[45:53] show you things that you don't have but
[45:56] what if God would have never came and
[45:57] delivered you God would have never came
[45:59] by and saw about you come on
[46:02] what kind of a shape you were in bad
[46:05] shape that's why I say God I I don't
[46:08] praise you just for materialistic things
[46:10] or the things that I I got that that
[46:13] don't determine my praise
[46:16] whether I have or don't have I almost
[46:18] feel praise God
[46:20] Hallelujah long as I still got breath
[46:24] lungs good lungs
[46:26] some people don't have good lungs some
[46:29] people can't even raise their voice and
[46:31] say hallelujah some people can't do that
[46:34] some people can't say thank you Jesus
[46:36] they can't do it but God has given us
[46:39] good lungs
[46:41] to praise him with and that's what I
[46:43] intend to do give God praise Hallelujah
[46:48] Jesus come on God is good ain't he ain't
[46:52] God good
[46:53] he's a good God you know that
[46:55] he's able I'll try to convince someone
[46:57] that don't you know what you work God is
[47:00] able to take care of you
[47:02] he brought you out he's able to take you
[47:04] in
[47:04] come on but they stumbled at that didn't
[47:07] he God don't God don't save you to lose
[47:10] you
[47:12] come on God's salvation the the the the
[47:15] that needs to be settled God began the
[47:19] good work he's able to finish it
[47:21] you know they're saying that song uh he
[47:23] brought me from a mighty long way
[47:26] he brought me from a mighty long way
[47:29] come on and I got this far up and I'm a
[47:31] doubt God now
[47:33] out of all the the He's Able you got to
[47:35] be persuaded like Paul said he's able to
[47:38] finish the work God that brought you
[47:39] he's able to keep you and take you on
[47:41] the rest of the way
[47:43] I know we keep repeating that but I
[47:45] gotta we gotta drive it home sometime
[47:47] He's Able he's able to finish it
[47:50] that Journey that you started on that
[47:52] path that when God lit your fire
[47:55] and you were running because you were on
[47:57] fire come on but it was your job to keep
[48:01] the fire going God lit the fire but it's
[48:04] your job to keep it going
[48:06] Hallelujah
[48:08] but somewhere along the line you're
[48:10] letting it go out
[48:12] and wonder why you don't have joy
[48:15] wonder why the peace is gone where's the
[48:17] fire where is that burning desire that
[48:20] you had to pray the reason Bible where's
[48:23] that desire God stir us up again
[48:27] stir up that fire again that's my desire
[48:30] y'all believe that tonight Hallelujah
[48:32] but he's able
[48:34] say God is able come on it's a finished
[48:36] work God don't finish the work you know
[48:38] that you know that's why those those
[48:41] Israel Israel when they came out you
[48:44] know they they never wrestled with
[48:46] I mean they never could stop from
[48:48] wrestling with that it was a completed
[48:51] work
[48:51] that God he brought you out just like he
[48:54] said he was right he came and visited
[48:56] you and he told you I'm gonna bring you
[48:58] into the land of good land flowing with
[49:00] milk and honey
[49:01] God kept the first part of the promise
[49:03] but he can't keep the second part come
[49:05] on
[49:06] it's already finished God already
[49:08] settled it
[49:09] the first part he's able to keep he was
[49:12] able to keep he's able to keep the
[49:13] second part it's Giants in the land come
[49:16] on but they're unbelief said what we in
[49:19] our own eyes as grasshoppers
[49:21] come on looking at the things that they
[49:23] saw which crippled them from having
[49:26] faith in God because they was looking at
[49:29] the things that they saw but Joshua and
[49:31] Caleb didn't look at those things
[49:33] they believed that the same guard that
[49:36] took us out he's able to carry us in
[49:39] we don't have I don't have a strategy we
[49:42] don't know how
[49:43] but I do know that he's still got all
[49:45] this power he ain't lost not an ounce of
[49:47] his power
[49:49] his power is still the same and don't
[49:51] you know that no matter how much the was
[49:53] going on today the Jesus Christ is still
[49:56] the same yesterday the day of forever
[49:58] come on only thing only thing it is is
[50:01] that we got more stuff now to cause us
[50:04] to cause unbelief to come
[50:07] the things that we we got access to more
[50:10] things now that'll cause us to not
[50:12] believe God but if those things weren't
[50:14] accessible to you you wouldn't have no
[50:16] other choice but to have faith in God
[50:19] Hallelujah then like they said where is
[50:22] your faith
[50:23] come on what's your faith been in God to
[50:26] try you you say God I believe you got to
[50:28] try you by that he knows he'll try you
[50:31] by that come on let's see where your
[50:34] faith is but if your faith is in him
[50:36] alone in the trial in the midst of all
[50:39] that you ain't gonna go stumble or fall
[50:41] all those things come on those things
[50:44] shake away from me you'll say Lord I
[50:46] know my faith was in you then and my
[50:48] faith is still in you now I believe you
[50:50] come on that you're able to finish the
[50:52] work God is able come on
[50:54] how many believe that tonight come on
[50:57] he's able to finish I like how the Bible
[50:59] talks about Abraham stagger not at the
[51:02] promise of God through unbelief come on
[51:05] but he was persuaded fully persuaded
[51:08] that God was able to perform that what
[51:10] she promised come on he knew that the
[51:13] god that started it was the one able to
[51:15] finish it y'all believe that tonight
[51:16] it's a finish work you know Jesus Jesus
[51:20] knew you know what it would take to get
[51:23] us there
[51:24] he knew what it would take to get us to
[51:26] that place that that he envisioned of us
[51:28] and saw us in his mind he knew what it
[51:31] would take
[51:32] but he didn't never start nothing like
[51:34] we says and I couldn't go there for the
[51:36] sake of time that he wasn't able to
[51:38] finish
[51:39] he knew what it would take
[51:41] he knew it would take him coming down
[51:44] being rejected of his own he knew that
[51:46] he knew it would take him being lied on
[51:49] cheated
[51:50] spit on well he knew he knew what it was
[51:54] going to take to finish that work
[51:56] to get us but he knew that if he if he
[51:58] didn't go that place go that route come
[52:01] on then you and I wouldn't be saved
[52:02] today
[52:03] but he never started nothing that he
[52:05] can't finish
[52:06] so when he was going through you know
[52:08] some people said he should have called
[52:10] down a legion of Angels or hire any
[52:12] errors he should have done this or
[52:13] whatever but no he wanted to finish the
[52:15] work
[52:16] many times he could have destroyed the
[52:18] world over and over and over because of
[52:20] sin but he didn't you know what he did
[52:23] he had you and I in his mind
[52:25] he had a Plan of Redemption you and I
[52:28] were lost he wanted to redeem us he
[52:31] wanted to save us and bring us back to
[52:33] him we didn't even understand that plan
[52:36] we didn't know nothing about it we were
[52:37] alienated from God
[52:40] by Wicked Works come on
[52:42] all our lives
[52:44] coming in we were walking in
[52:46] transgression not even thinking about
[52:48] God but when we were in trespassing sin
[52:51] God still died for us God was working
[52:54] when we didn't think about him God was
[52:56] working something out because he knew
[52:59] that one day he was gonna have to answer
[53:01] and stand before God so he was working
[53:03] something out the Plan of Redemption
[53:05] come on
[53:06] he knew that what it would cost he knew
[53:08] what it would take but yet he did it
[53:10] anyway
[53:11] and then when he hung on that cross he
[53:14] said Lord it's finished
[53:16] he finished the work
[53:17] he didn't leave nothing undone he
[53:19] finished it
[53:21] and all whosoever will let him come
[53:25] I finished the work
[53:27] I'm gonna take care of you I settled it
[53:30] forever
[53:31] I got you Hallelujah I like that he
[53:34] finished the work how many believe that
[53:36] tonight come on it's a finished work
[53:39] don't struggle at the small things at
[53:41] the beginning come on once you wrestle
[53:44] your mind God God it isn't just by
[53:46] happening God chose me just just by
[53:48] happening that I chose him but he chose
[53:51] me
[53:51] this is something that he done I'm a Son
[53:53] of God I'm a daughter of God I belong to
[53:56] him I'm settling with that Hallelujah it
[53:59] ain't in what I can do for him is what
[54:01] he already done for me now I'm going on
[54:03] to the deeper things in God I ain't
[54:06] struggling with that no more I'm going
[54:07] on to the deeper things and God I'm
[54:08] going in places in him because I want to
[54:11] I want to know more about it I want him
[54:13] to express himself a little bit more to
[54:15] me Hallelujah I'm going on Hallelujah
[54:28] felt like singing believe I testify
[54:30] while I have a chance
[54:32] I may not have this chance anymore amen
[54:35] but I believe I'll testify
[54:38] we thank God for
[54:40] the word tonight we
[54:45] we know there's much ground and
[54:47] territory to cover
[54:49] and we got a short time to do what God
[54:52] called you and I to do
[54:55] amen is Souls that are dying and going
[54:58] to hell and God is ordained you to speak
[55:00] to him
[55:01] to be a witness to them
[55:04] and if you don't be that witness to them
[55:06] God will hold you responsible and hold

[1:02:21] in Jesus name we pray
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:26] God is good
[1:02:29] the book of First Corinthians
[1:02:32] 11 chapter and 23rd verse
[1:02:35] God is good amen
[1:02:39] I remember
[1:02:40] we came up and on
[1:02:43] especially just before Easter we always
[1:02:46] had Friday night everybody was up
[1:02:48] confessing their false and I can see the
[1:02:52] some of the sisters go get sister so and
[1:02:54] so on they take her in the back or in
[1:02:56] the room and they said sister son get
[1:02:59] that straightened
[1:03:00] so and so on get that straight and
[1:03:03] everybody had to get straight they
[1:03:05] didn't want to take communion to every
[1:03:07] channel is clear
[1:03:09] you got all all in your heart against a
[1:03:12] brother sister everybody's getting clear
[1:03:15] you know those days ain't passed God is
[1:03:19] still the same
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:22] and then now those that
[1:03:25] you know if the Bible said if we don't
[1:03:28] take communion you have no part with me
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:33] and then if you're taking on Worthy
[1:03:36] then your dad it's a damnation to your
[1:03:38] soul
[1:03:39] so you ain't got no way out
[1:03:43] are you with me
[1:03:44] so you got to take it if you're going to
[1:03:47] take it take it right
[1:03:49] isn't that right
[1:03:52] you identify with him as a Christian
[1:03:55] so you need to take communion because
[1:03:57] you're identified
[1:03:58] with him as a Christian
[1:04:01] Lord I'm in this
[1:04:03] together with Christ
[1:04:06] are you with me
[1:04:09] now
[1:04:10] it says
[1:04:13] First Corinthians
[1:04:16] 11 and 23 for I receive of the Lord that
[1:04:20] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:04:25] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:04:28] was betrayed to Morin and when he had
[1:04:32] given thanks he break it
[1:04:36] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:04:40] is broken for you just doing remember to
[1:04:43] me
[1:04:45] after the same manner also he took the
[1:04:48] cup and when he had such sin this cup is
[1:04:52] the New Testament in my blood
[1:04:54] just do ye in as often as you drink it
[1:04:58] and remember to me suppose when they
[1:05:01] were coming out the Wilderness they say
[1:05:03] well I don't I I I'm not going to take
[1:05:05] I'm not gonna
[1:05:09] of that lamb in the blood and so forth I
[1:05:13] I I'm just I just ain't gonna do it
[1:05:15] there are people that don't those people
[1:05:17] had no choice if they wanted the deaf
[1:05:20] Angel to pass over them then they were
[1:05:22] certain amen that the Passover this is
[1:05:26] the Passover when I see the blood I'll
[1:05:28] pass over you
[1:05:29] are you with me so let's not take it
[1:05:32] light let's take it serious and sincere
[1:05:35] amen because some people for three
[1:05:38] people take it so light I ain't got to
[1:05:39] take it no
[1:05:41] but we want to
[1:05:43] identify with him
[1:05:46] because his blood was shedded for us
[1:05:49] and when in his death in his
[1:05:52] that he died for us
[1:05:55] and when we take communion we're doing
[1:05:57] it because it is what he commanded us to
[1:06:00] do
[1:06:01] are you with me
[1:06:03] just like we get baptized because that's
[1:06:06] what we're supposed to do we wash feet
[1:06:08] because he said
[1:06:10] Peter said Lord you never wash my feet
[1:06:12] he said but if I watch you not you have
[1:06:14] no power with me
[1:06:17] he said not my feet only but you can
[1:06:20] watch me all over
[1:06:22] are you with me
[1:06:23] so what happens Christians look like
[1:06:26] they want to avoid things now
[1:06:29] are you with me
[1:06:31] let's be faithful to God and identify
[1:06:35] with his suffering
[1:06:37] the cross
[1:06:40] okay
[1:06:44] 25th verse
[1:06:46] in the same manner he took
[1:06:49] the cup
[1:06:50] and when he had such saying this cup is
[1:06:53] the New Testament in my blood
[1:06:56] just
[1:06:58] just do ye as often you drink
[1:07:01] in what
[1:07:04] members of me when they left Egypt they
[1:07:07] were to keep the Passover isn't that
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:11] and I'll pass over lamb which is Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ the sacrifice for us
[1:07:16] and we don't they saw the need and the
[1:07:19] seriousness of the Passover amen
[1:07:23] and they still acknowledge that to this
[1:07:26] day
[1:07:27] coming out of Egypt
[1:07:29] but we've come out of sin
[1:07:32] are you with me
[1:07:34] God has not covered our sin but he's
[1:07:37] actually annihilated took it completely
[1:07:40] out of the way he said you're sending
[1:07:42] the negatives well I remember no more we
[1:07:45] were bondage and bondage to sin
[1:07:48] but God has freed us
[1:07:51] and giving us eternal life
[1:07:54] and we recognize Lord as often you do
[1:07:58] this let's remember Capri
[1:08:01] let's remember what he done on the cross
[1:08:03] for us
[1:08:05] oh
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:08] oh we take it lightly now
[1:08:12] let's not take it lightly
[1:08:14] let's take it to heart
[1:08:16] and tell God how much we appreciate what
[1:08:18] he does
[1:08:20] Lord if you hadn't done that I'll still
[1:08:22] be a sinner
[1:08:23] there's no way for me to get back to God
[1:08:26] I couldn't have eternal life
[1:08:28] but Lord look what you've done for me
[1:08:32] for example you eat this bread and drink
[1:08:35] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[1:08:38] till he what
[1:08:40] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:08:43] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:08:45] Lord unworthy be guilty of the body
[1:08:49] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:08:52] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:08:55] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:08:58] that eateth and drinking unworldly
[1:09:00] eating and drinking damnation to himself
[1:09:03] not Discerning the what
[1:09:06] for
[1:09:09] this cause many a weak and sickly among
[1:09:12] you and many sleep
[1:09:15] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:09:18] should not be con judge but when we are
[1:09:22] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[1:09:26] we should not be what
[1:09:28] condemn with the world
[1:09:30] well for my brethren when you come
[1:09:34] together to eat tear one for another
[1:09:40] and if any man hunger let him what
[1:09:44] that you come not together unto
[1:09:47] condemnation
[1:09:49] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:09:52] come God bless amen
[1:09:57] let us just be mindful and pray for the
[1:10:00] tonight
