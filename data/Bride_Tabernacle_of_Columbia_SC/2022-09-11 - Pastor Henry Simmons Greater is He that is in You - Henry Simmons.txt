with your power for father that's what we need in jesus name thank you god bless the word now in jesus name amen book of first john 4. first john 4. it says and one it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they be of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist whereby whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world together ye of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world god bless you towards you may be seated thank god this morning greater is he that is in you praise god that you know it just was in prayer yesterday and i just had another message that i thought i was going to bring concerning the glory of the lord amen and we realized that amen in order to get god's glory back we know that the glory god sometimes is departed from the church but it's an individual thing it's not a church it's not a group it's an individual you know we can you can come to church and you can come and you can look for somebody else to bring something to you or for you amen but the only way you're going to have the glory the lord and i and i was looking back at israel and as the glory of the lord has departed and and um we find that um israel went out to battle against the philistines and um we find that when they went out to battle against the philistine uh we found that they were defeated they they had to run and then um that was uh they bought the ark of the covenant and and and the philistines got afraid they said oh the ark is here and the the the the ones that god delivered out of egypt they began to they began to get afraid but they took courage and they accidentally defeated israel but before the defeat of israel israel had some problems those that were buried now uh uh phineas and and his brother they they were carrying out and they bought it back but they were actually taking bribes at the temple and they was lying with the women and all of that but yet it was taken off in the battle samuel's sons had hofner and finney hats they had forsaken the law i mean they weren't doing what right before the law yet they had the ark the ark was where israel where the word was and where god was where the glory of god was and amen they were to carry that out and sometimes he meant people can carry the word and carry it out but yet they mean their lives are off they're living any kind of way carrying them off but when they went out to battle they found out they couldn't win even though they had the heart even though the philistines are scared because they had to off and then next thing you know they were losing half nine fenney heist was killed one one fled back to samuel from the battle and told samuel samuel wanted to know how the battle going and he was telling them that we were being defeated and there's your son hopped on finney hats they were killed and when they told samuel news because he was a heavy man he fell backwards broke his neck and died his daughter-in-law was pregnant with a child when she heard the news that a husband was killed in battle israel was losing they heard about the ark of the lord was taken the philistine had taken the war out from them taking the ark thought that they thought would cause them to win the battle the ark that they amen thought that that's where god would come down with the chicano glory where the philistines took dark from them and killed him and when the daughter-in-law heard the news said ichabod the son she began to bring forth the sun ichabod the glory of the lord has departed the glory of the lord has departed that's what i thought i was going to talk to you about the glory of the lord departing and sometimes amen and i looked this morning and i you know i'm you know i hear praying early this morning and i said lord where are the people that pray people don't even care about god no more they don't even care about praying and we're wondering why things happen they don't even care they spend more time in anything and doing anything they don't even care they come to church expecting god to move and they don't even care what time they get here oh god no move and everything is wrong everything is bad why people don't even care they got no concern about that we're in a battle we're in our army we're soldiers in the army of the lord and we're in a battle people need prayer people need you to be standing in the camp and crying out the lord lord help him somebody got to do it somebody got to get stirred up enough about god i'll come an hour early i'll come and pray i'll come and cry to god i'll come and say lord i need you i was calling caleb this morning i said keller come on out come on come on i need you here early i need you here in prayer you know you know i i'm telling everybody come on out we need prayer things are happening to people and and yet it's no stir i don't want to call the people to pray i want the people to see the need of prayer amen i don't want to call the fast i want the people to see the need to fast you know you know you don't have to tell people what to do when they know what they need to do i wonder if god is talking to the people amen the condition that we are facing the things that are happening in our present tense world the things that are happening in our homes and our families the things that are happening we need to pray something all the stars lord let me let me let me not eat breakfast this morning let me pray about the situation lord i care i wonder do we really care about one another i i wonder we're really concerned about the atmosphere that we won't create in there we want to see god move i want to do we want you know and they said why why the glory not here why the presence not like it used to be because the people are not doing what they used to do i mean my wife was talking about that and i said i said be quiet i said because she was in the same channel and i and that she kind of felt a little bad because he thought i rebuking her i said i'm not review you know i understand that's the channel i'm you know the lord i said we always like that i said if you was a woman preacher i'd be glad to have you from my partner see because when the lord began to deal with us it god ought to be dealing with the people on the same basis and that's why you come for the witness you come to witness the presence of god the anointing of god the power of god in your midst if you come to church and you're not looking and expecting nothing you would get nothing but you come expecting god to move not just to speak to you amen but god i need your anointing i need your power i need your spirit i need you lord but is it coming a time when amen you come with something do you got you got something you want to give you got something that you want to give amen you got you you're bringing something with you praise god you're not just coming to collect and to receive i'm coming to give something amen because god gave me something to give amen you know i you know sometimes i see the preachers struggling in service and and they jumping and hollering and screaming and i don't know no presence no nothing and they're hollering loud they're saying good things no presence and i just sat there and i just started praying hard lord heaven lord do something lord send your anointing lord next thing you know the presence of god come in now you know you know that's what you do amen if if if if god is not if i'm not in the right channel all you got to do start praying god bless brother simon god help him god do something amen and then you'll experience god blessing amen the man of god with what you need but instead of doing that sometimes we have reservations now i wonder what he's going to say i ah heard that before instead of saying god bless them god get them in the right channel god i need something funny lord bless amen and then all of a sudden everything changed because you praying and you actually expecting something you want amen to people to be blessed you want to be blessed amen and you start praying and oftentimes we have to pray not saying my prayer made a difference but thank god it showed what the difference amen it could have been somebody else praying but one thing about it i didn't want to be guilty of sitting there not praying amen i wanted to be one praying lord bless the lord do something lord say something yeah yeah and that's what we do i say lord bless in jesus name lord help them in jesus name lord bless the word lord says speak to our hearts yes lord and this morning i you know i i i wasn't gonna say those things but the glory of the lord amen i want your glory lord i want you when you walk in the house of the lord that the glory of the lord will meet you amen there's the presence of the lord and it meets you but it takes some praying people it takes some people that's really going to make a sacrifice and i'm going to cry out to god and i'm going to see god move in my life and amen god i know you'll move for your people amen but some people that really believe god and really want to see a move of the holy ghost and the move of god and lord god in need to pray [Music] amen there's got to be somebody that's going to catch a whole amen if i don't do nothing about the situation ain't nothing going to be done if i just sat here amen and you know the the the the leopard scene and uh when the the camp was in the country was amen the enemy had like grasshoppers that covered the country and israelites it was in in battle and they were engulfed amen praise god surrounded by the enemy but those leopards amen they realized that they were going to start the death and they said well i said we're here till we die and you know what they did they went into the enemy camp and god had already did the job but if they would have sat there and god had already did they would have never knew amen but i want you to know amen that god can set your enemies in doubt he's just waiting on you not to shut down and die he waiting on you to make a move in the right direction amen they knew if i ever i'm going there in the enemy camp praise god i don't care for god i'm going because i sat here i'm going to die anyway praise god i'm going into the enemy camp but brother and sister we got to take courage this morning we got to take courage and amen praise god he that is in you amen then the greater is what he that is in he that is in me are you with me greater is he that is in me then he that is in the world amen how many believe that that he's greater than all amen he that is in the world you believe that this morning you know sometimes you we're not just trying to get you emotionally involved in the word but we're trying to get you to understand it meant the devil don't want you to move and don't want you to believe and the devil will stop your ears and stop your heart amen but somebody says well i'm in doubt i'm in doubt because i don't want to say something that is not there i don't want to say that he's in me when he not so i i can't go along with y'all and i can't say greater is he that's in me because he's not really in me so i have reservation about saying greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world when i don't have enough faith to believe that he's there my confidence is i don't know whether he's in me then there's others that said i don't want him in me the reason why i don't want him in me because greater is the world that's in me greater is the devil that's in me you see it's either one that's in you another greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world or greater is the devil that's controlling me then god that wants you to welcome him in are you with me if you don't ever to invite him in he's not going to force himself on you you got to want him to come and welcome him lord i want you in and i want you to be the greater one how many won't you want him to be the greater one amen you don't want the world but you want him to be the greater one are you with me then you got to say i i i'm not going to sit here amen and die because i want the greater not the lesser but the greater i want jesus to be in me are you with me i want him there amen and i want to be able to say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i want to testify that i want to make it real you know i thought about play play church amen i said some folk been playing church long enough play play church we come to church and we play around like we really mean it and we don't really mean business with god that's play play church god is not moving in our lives because we are lying to ourselves we're not being honest with ourselves amen we're not really doing what we need to do amen to be able to testify greater is he that's in me praise god you got to trust god if you want him to be greater you got to trust him yes lord i trust you lord i believe in you lord i believe you real you my god you lord you're everything to me amen i hear angelica singing that song this morning but you you got to you got to really amen praise god know that god is everything to you he means everything to me praise god i'm going to tell you brother and sister you got to get down to real business amen because our god is here wanting to express himself and wants to show you his glory he wants to do exploits for you but he wants somebody that's willing to trust him and somebody that have enough confidence to believing that i'm god praise god and i'm a jealous god and i have no other god before me praise god i want you to know amen praise god i want to surrender my all and all to him i want him to have everything amen i want him to have my mind i want him to have my heart my soul everything god i want to surrender to you i want your will to be done in not mine god here i am i'm totally dependent on him amen praise god i'm not playing church i'm i'm not playing like i'm a christian i am i mean business amen i love god and i want to do his will i want to serve him i want him to oh god amen sometimes you see those hypocritical spirits those lying demons of folks that come around and play like they want god and no they don't love him and no they don't like him they met those spirits of the antichrist that's against the word jesus said something about loving him in the fifth chapter first john he says whosoever believeth that jesus christ is who whosoever believed that jesus is the christ is what born of god you know and and that's something about being born of god praise god it's no longer that you sat around with your proud spirit lifted up and thank you something when you're nothing oh god i said what's going on with you brother amen these spirits that's been binding people people been coming to church and don't even want god they may sat around and hindered the spirit sat around and hid the people from being blessed because they just come to church it's a traditional type thing we don't really mean that we want god we're just playing around we just come because that's the right thing to do pay my tithes and offerings amen that's all it is about ain't about that brother sister what do you give what you don't give praise god it's about whether or not you're going to be real with god whether or not you god's going whether or not you want the real god you're not coming to church to play because i got to come my mama made me come daddy made me come amen husband is here and life is here amen i'm coming because i want to come i'm coming because i need god i want to hear from god i want to be blessed praise god i know god cares about me you care enough about me to die for my sins he cared enough about me to be whipped and spit on and i don't care nothing about him i don't care a thing about him because i don't believe in him i don't love him yet you want god to bless you and do things for you and yet you treat god any kind of way praise god sometimes i'm going to tell you something sometimes you turn a deaf ear to god and you curse your own self and then you want somebody to pray god or pray this demon from away from you and you doing god any kind of way not knowing that god is judging you for what you think how you treat him amen you treat him any kind of way but you want god to speak and you want god to do things for you in your life it's almost like god under my turns under my it's my terms well you know you come when i you know i when i need you i call you when i don't need you i ain't calling you you know what i'm saying so we we we navigate i mean we're in control in other situations and things we tell god when you know i you know i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister if you want god to move in your life amen you're gonna have to get out of there that you use it's the new age worship that i that you are god amen and and you can bless yourself and you can do that new age witchcraft spirit you know a lot of people are moving in the new age witchcraft spirit because they're teaching it in school they're using the same concepts of uh to make your own self create your own atmosphere your own well i mean you know they're going into new age stuff and and people are going in a new age and they creating their own happiness and not knowing that you cannot create your own happiness and the minute you go into new age and witchcraft the first thing is coming to you is drugs drugs and sex if you want to know what you uh getting deeper in witchcraft watch what the devil offers drugs and sex amen are you with me the deeper you get into it the deeper you get in the witchcraft spirit in a deeper hole that you're digging bondage you're getting more bound up the deeper you get the harder it is to get out are you with me so what happens there's a new age spirit that that the children are latching onto they say they got a a picture they call craft how many of you ever seen that picture crap y'all ain't gonna raise your hand and they said teach you how to cast spells you know they headed out some years ago and people were watching it and said that's a new age entered into the new age and witchcraft and then they had they got it one they released slightly craft and that's a new age the new age spirit a lot of people entering into that spirit of the new age they the demons that they're teaching them how to catch spells how to get rid of stuff like that the more you get into that the more bond that you get into see people if they don't want god then they begin to because it's it's just in people don't want to know what what my horoscope is well what i'm going to do today you know you know i'm born in this month huh be like this supposed to be like that you know people get into all that stuff instead of getting into christ and god lord you lead me you guide me next thing you know oh lord i don't want to get into those things but the things that the devil is offering the world and greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world praise god so what is happening the people are getting so worked up and getting so messed up amen until amen it's coming a time when you cannot help the people because they resist amen they resist the truth they stand in on and against the word and they don't really want the word you can tell me later yeah you saw that movie yeah i didn't think it did me no harm but it did are you with me but i want to be arrested and pray for me because unknowingly spirits might have come off of that on me you might have released them in your house you might have released those spirits in your life there's so many spirits that we we're actually releasing on us out on ourselves the children just on those little games they're releasing all kind of spirits parents giving me game where they can get them get off my nerves go play this game go play that used to be everything was either educational or spiritual now they do anything are you with me i gotta i gotta get somewhere great is he that's in you that he that is in the world what i found out and you know the prophet of god was bringing out some sting and what i found out you know what i was studying and when i was right writing and and in prayer then i said let me let me go see what the prophecy you know find out we we don't want to call i said the holy ghost always have you on one accord you see what i'm saying he ain't gonna say something different to you the holy ghost ain't gonna tell brother fred something different it said to me about the same word amen if it's the holy ghost it's gonna speak the same thing there ain't gonna be no division it's what we want we if we really want god see because a church is not a place you come and you don't want god church is the place to come to you that you really want god and you really want god to be a supernatural god a god of power a god of love a god that amen when you've got things going on in your life a god that can resolve the issues amen can give you peace can give you joy a god of love praise god you can be happy praise god you know a lot of people because they're not happy and they're missing out on something and they make they feel uh excluded then they go into the depression and oppression and all of that amen and they're looking for joy and they're looking for some type of peace they're looking for somebody to love them praise god they're looking for love in their own places because they don't understand they meant that what they need is god i'm looking for love and i can't find love so they reach out there ain't been looking for somebody to love him somebody to care about him praise god find out amen that that's not true love out there so people are caught up out there looking for love looking for somebody to care about them they're caught up now brothers and sisters here we are the greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world and i'm telling you brother and sister there's so many people that need to be loved but they won't let the one that really loved them they won't let him love them because amen it's a lack of confidence and faith and trust in him amen because there's so many people that will stand and talk about they have the love of god that they're not they don't really have what they say and they're looking at them and they said that if that is the love of god and that is god then i don't want that kind of god a god that criticizes of god that's already always condemning and always judging always saying by negative things i don't want that one but i want a god that really cares about me even in my condition even when i'm down and even when i'm out even when i'm in a bad way even when i'm doing bad things i need a god that understands that all i want to be and all i want is you jesus all i want is love all i want is somebody to care amen praise god so we reach out to other means and other things because we can't get what we want they meant from seem as though we can't get it from god amen see until we ask god and it's not coming lord the lord are you there amen praise god god just want you to get in the right channel right focus amen you amen to believe amen he said only believe all things are possible to them that would believe for those that would trust me oh he'll show himself amen oh if you only trust him amen but you only want to trust him and you're going to have a limited uh trust in god you limit the most high god you're only going to go but so far you're not going to go all the way and then you're going to say god somehow i believe that i i i i i tried i tried it's not in trying but trust me amen by believing him it's not what you tried what you believe if you believed in all things are possible amen if you say to the mountain these are removed and shall not die in your heart but believe that what you say you already have it then you shall have what you say are you with me see but what happens you say it and you don't believe in yourself and nothing is done but great is he

right praise god god's love me and god forgives me what can i forgive are you with me some folk can't do it no matter how much you try to drill and forgive forgive have compassion love eat see until he comes down but we got a religious spirit a separate spirit that we got there we won't let jesus come in and give us the right kind of spirit we're not going to allow him to get because we're standing for a righteousness but our own human spirit we think that's the holy spirit because it's a self-righteous judgmental spirit and we'll stand up like we'll fight for jesus jesus don't need you
