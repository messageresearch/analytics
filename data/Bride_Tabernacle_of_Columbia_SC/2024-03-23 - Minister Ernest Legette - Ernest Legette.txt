blood no substitute I don't care what you can have nothing takes the place of the blood of Jesus the blood that he shed for us way back on Calvary there is no substitute there's no substitute for God's word there's no substitute nothing can replace it amen there's no sub sub itute are you with me and there's no substitute for you praise God because you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen the prophet I was reading the prophet says he was talking about um the seed of the serpent he was talking about Cain and he said that uh people were having trouble with Genesis said I gotten a man from the Lord and He was saying that there was you know Eve didn't get a a man from the Lord cuz God was not kain's father are you with me the Lord wasn't but all life that comes in The World God Only life could come through God are y'all with me but he was saying that when it comes down to the life that's in Adam and in Eve because they were a son and daughters of God then he says where did Cain get his nature from Cain had to get his nature from somewhere else because Eve and Adam was the son and daughter of God but the Bible says Cain was of that Wicked one he killed he murdered are you with me he lied are you with me so we thank God that and he said what about Judas he said Judas was born the son of prediction even before he got in the world he was born that way to do what he did he was ordained before the foundation he was going to do it when he was born he was born the son of predition so brothers and sister I said all of that to say this you were born when you're born again the Holy Ghost is a witness the holy ghost witness that you are Sons and Daughters of God only through the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you have that witness that you are a son or daughter of God the Holy Ghost let you know and give you that Assurance without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have doubt you have fear you can think and you can believe it all you want but the Holy Ghost is a witness and except we receive re the baptism of the Holy Ghost will never be Sons and Daughters of God because the Holy Ghost is a witness that you are Sons and Daughters of God are you with me so the Holy Ghost is very important that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost how you get it praise God he said Jacob didn't care how he got it he wanted the birthright you got to want it so bad to God I got to have it because it's the birthright and I got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got to have God that Assurance I got to have that seal I got to have the Holy Ghost so I ain't going to get in way but I already did right God bless you thank God for you so we going to sing that little song as we have dedication of the baby tonight amen bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in so pan say it oh okay you sing that song God pointing at you you pointing at God okay let's stand we're going to have dedication of the baby amen br of repr the BL of Jesus Christ [Applause] TR GL Amen Let Us bow tonight Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for blessing us God to be able to come here tonight Lord God as the song says how we prove you Lord more and more and oh God

brother M my Fallin law tonight Lord that you continue Lord touching him in a special way Lord God I thank you Lord for all the lives you've been touching Lord I Thank you Lord for my mom Lord having joy in her heart God and oh God just hearing the testimony what the Lord is doing for God I pray you continue God blessing and moving in a mighty way God we know that sometimes the flesh might be weak but the spirit is willing and oh God I pray tonight Lord that you might come in our midst Lord and you might speak in a still small voice oh God and give us what we have need of Lord I pray God we thank you we love you in all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Hebrews 11 by the grace of God Hebrews 11 and 34 just I guess we just start on a little something and Lord put on our hearts amen try not to be long today tonight I mean amen get my times mixed up God is so good ain't it some strange things been happening Ain't It Strange Things been happening but God is real ain't he we know that he's got it all in control amen Hebrews 11 and we'll begin here at the let's begin at 32nd verse we got it say amen and it reads and what shall I shall I shall I more say for time would fail to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson of Jeff and David also and Samuel and of prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax violent and fight and turned to the flight the armies of aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they may obtain a better Resurrection may God bless bless the reading of his word tonight by the grace of God I just I just want to minister just for a moment on out of weakness Amen on out of weakness you know I like how the Bible here you know talks about you know he says time would failed you know to tell everybody testimony right because you know it's something that what God you know I was looking at something the prophet of God was talking saying that you know of what God's kingdom is going to be made up of people that been through something of the outcast the rejected the ones that suffered a while but God makes his kingdom up of those of those kind of people but we find that I says you know out of weakness you know out of weakness made strong you know I was thinking I said it's hard it's hard for a man or it's hard for God to be the strength of a man when he think when he thinks he's at his height it's hard for God to be the strength of a man when he thinks he's at his height you know I was thinking of something the other night the other morning rather and I said you know sometimes people they they they say they can't they can't pray or they on the fire the time to pray right but God's got a way of driving you to your knees he's got a way of doing that don't he and he knows what it takes to get each and every one of us down on our knees again thought it was something uh you know brother Fred was talking the other night was on the way to sh and he was saying about how you know the about the Halo and the pillar of fire you know being in the churches and how God he was hearing of how you know God was moving at a time and he was saying I wonder what happened cuz God didn't change and then brother Brooks was saying the same thing the other night I thought that was something that cuz God never changed right but God's got a way of getting us where we need to be at and I thank God for that but I says you know it's hard for God to get a man you know uh uh to that place when he's when he's thinks he's already in a certain spot right I thought about Nebuchadnezzar and all and I say you know you know even after God warned him in a dream to pretty much you know watch yourself right don't think you too higher than what you are but even after being warned in the dream he his flesh he couldn't help but to be lifted up up in it right but in that time God you know as he begin to say all the things he done and the Bible said a voice fell from heaven didn't it but and caused them you know to go out into the field we know the story but at the end of all of that you know I like how the Bible says you know he lifted up his voice and he blessed the Lord Praise You Know came out of all of that he he learned how to praise he learned learned how to give God let's say Glory out of all of that didn't he after all of that but what it was that wasn't just uh uh done just to be done but you know God was showing us something there and a lot of times we look at it as you can't you can't force a humility a humility you can't it's something that you can't make up but it's something that God does for you in your life it's a place that where you being you and yourself wouldn't have went but God took took you there but from then you learned how to bless God from then you learned you always conscience then of of you giving God the glory in all things and you know I was thinking I says you know was looking at I says you know a lot of times you know you know people I I says most of the most of the strongest men I was thinking about Jesus in his even in his uh time you know of of guest enemy and he was was praying and how the Bible you know he's kept saying Lord if it be your will let this cup pass I mean let the cup pass but then he kept going back and praying but in agony the Bible says that he was praying and all these things but I like how the Bible says that you know in the Book of Luke that an angel came and strengthened him you know but even at that time I says you know God gets us uh uh to a place you know at at your at your weakness we as we say even at your at out of weak made strong you know it's situations and I thought about you know a lot of this because I was I was been doing a lot of witnessing lately or you know talking about Lord on the job but I was saying you know one of the guys he told me he says uh Ernest this a guy named Ryan he says he says man I think they walk my friend out today and and uh it's a guy he grew up with on the job but he says um I mean he grew up with him in Greenville but the guy had been working at the job for about a week and he didn't even know who he was and they're only I think 36 years old but he says I didn't I couldn't even recognize him said he recognized me but I couldn't recognize him and he says you know when I finally recognized him he said I stared there and looked at him for a moment he says it broke my heart Earnest to see him he said I said to him uh uh pudding that he called him by his nickname he said is that you he said yeah he says he says man man he says I wanted to ask him so bad he says but I asked him you all right say he wanted to ask him so bad what happened to him cuz he's only 36 years old he wasn't even recognizable but he said he asked him are you all right he said the guy response to him was life did this to me and I and then he he's coming to work I guess drunk and then so they walked him out but I told Ryan I says you know that something happened to him something in life broke him you know I said something in life got him to his weakest point and it broke him and you know what happens I said a lot of a lot of people today they they walking around like they normal but they ain't but they done lost it something broke them they walking around like they normal but they're not really themselves and what happens some someday something will happen and and it and and it'll just blow over Edge and you say I didn't know that was but they always they broke something broke them long time ago but you didn't know it we were saying like how somebody spilled some somebody got some some soda or something spilled on their shoes and they killed two people I said that ain't normal they walked around I said I didn't know they had that they lost it they've been you know but I says what it is only God can help us through those times you know at those breaking points what happens a lot of times it says individuals out of weakness made strong individuals at their weakest times right they turn to everything but Jesus at the times when you when they need him the most or or when only he can help them they turn everywhere else but him right but I says the thing is that's that's the time you know when you try to introduce people to Christ and let them know that it doesn't matter what you been through what you're going through at your Breaking Point God can do something at your Breaking Point come on at the point where everybody turned around turned turned you away nobody seem can help you and all those things it's somebody that been there before come on somebody's got a testimony and I'm one of them that can tell tell you that God will take up time with you come on at your weakest point that God will be your strength come on I I was saying to myself a little saying I was thinking about some you know some situations I've been praying praying for and I said you've been strong for too long come on now it's time to let God handle it you know you can you can try to handle that situation for so long and it break you but learn turn it over to Jesus come on God want to help you in that situation but many of times we find individuals don't do that do they we find that but I say it's what it is out of weakness God will take that that that weakest moment come on we call it we looking here at the Christian side of it but a lot of times even for God to get a person's attention he brings them to that place come on he brings you and and and to do that to let you know that he loves you come on he sometimes whether it's sickness whether it's just the trials of Life all these things God want to get Glory out of that situation come on you got to let God get Glory out of it I don't believe it was one person that ever cried out to God and really meant it from the bottom of their heart that he didn't come and see about them no matter the name no matter the family the church whatever when a person cried out for God open as I was saying the other other Sunday at church what it is you in we invite God in but he already know that you just want the torment to be gone you don't want him to be ruled over your life come on but God I said not only let God come in he going to deal with the torment but he wants to rule in your life come on what happens it's so hard to surrender it's so hard to let go come on but after the devil done beat you up after the devil done torment at your mind after the devil down had you cry all your tears out here come Jesus walking in come on they want to pick you up out of that place where you are and all the glory of God it is that's where he gets his glory at when the devil down walked all over you come on when the devil down beat you took your body through all kinds of things and the doctors can't find out what's wrong with you that's when God gets the glory I was talking with somebody the other day and they doing all doing a lot of talking and pouring their heart and soul out you know and saying and I was I was trying to tell them I said that's the thing you've been trying to handle it you got to let go and let God handle it come on I said you can't even praise you can't even God can't even get the praise out of your life as you are because you sitting there trying to deal with that situation I says but what it is I can't let that situation break me come on I can't let nothing stop my praise nothing stop my growth in God God come on whatever it is I said Lord no matter what I'm still going to praise you the end goal is to make Heaven my home come on when it's all said and done that's what the kingdom of go uh of God is made up of come on those kind of people that was when they was at their ends with they found somehow to still press their way through Hallelujah but we find that I says out of weakness what happens you know in in in the weak weaknesses come on don't forget to turn to God in the weaknesses don't forget that God is all powerful come on in your weakness don't forget that God he is the creator of Heaven and Earth you know I was thinking about some things the other day and just the massiveness we can't even uh uh comprehend come on the mass of of what God is but what the devil's job is to do is to keep you believing that God don't care about you and your situation come on but God not only does he cares he knows he already knew the thing that would stump you the thing that would come your way but what he wants you to do is let him come in and deal with the situation oh Jesus you know I was I was sharing with the a guy the day at work I know I got off work after 5:00 but I was sitting there talking to guy at work and he was saying man I didn't know you was from Mullins he said my wife's from Mullin we got to talking and you know we know a lot of the same people and things and he was just talking about you know um how it is in Mullins and how they don't have jobs down there and how you know you know the uh the situation is and how and you know the how dire the situation is going on and and the things he was just talking I says but I says the thing is I begin to tell them I says you know and how the Lord saved me at an early age in life I said the thing is out of all that we can talk about in all those things and and all of you know what transpired in my life even up to now the greatest thing that I could ever have done was to give Jesus my heart come on at an early age I says and you know what when in that moment from from that moment I haven't turned around I haven't turned to look back come on that's what it is you know sometimes we talk about the past but if you don't be careful the devil will have you looking back come on but there's nothing to look back to Hallelujah I said I can only look forward to what God has in store for me you know I was sharing with some I said the thing is you know I was talking another guy at work and he was uh he was breaking to us down about the uh the the law of physics and he was talking about certain things and then he got to talking about the Bible then he says that you know uh about Witchcraft and how he says that they they say witchcraft is bad that's just because they don't want to uh let us uh uh they they don't want us to tap into it because it'll be tapping into your inner power and stuff he's going on and on teaching us all you think he was like 26 years old but then he started saying even Jesus used witchcraft he started talking like that and that that might have got my attention right there so I got to tell him I said no ho ho and then he then he began to say um he don't understand how people believe the Bible when it's got so many contradictions in it and I said show me one contradiction in the scriptures and then he says well okay he says for one he says the Bible says you shouldn't ask God for anything or ask him any questions I said show me that in the Bible I said uh I was always taught you know that you have not because you ask not come on I started quoting those scriptures and he says I'll show you I said well show us I said it that could be proven so then after a while then he began to saying you know how you your Grandmama use witchcraft when she he said you remember when you got sick and and and your grandma laid you on the bed and he's real young you Grandma laid you on the bed and put incense all around and made all kind of I said my grandma didn't do that I said when I got sick my Grandma and Mama laid hands on you just like the Bible says come on so then uh he was talking but he he was really you can tell he's really really in well intelligent but sometimes you know we can be so so deep right cuz we let him teach us for about half an hour but going on with that and then um after a while he followed me outside to the car and he says Ernest I want to apologize to you well he caught up with me he says I couldn't find that in the Bible where it says don't ask God for nothing these things so I says he says I don't know why he says but that's always what I've been told I says a lot of problem is people don't read the Bible for their s i says they've been told and and they a lot of people go to church don't read the Bible for their s so they don't know what's in there I said I'm going tell you something I says I says the Lord saved me at an early age I says but I don't want I I would I wouldn't be telling the truth if I told you I understood everything right I says but I can't say that I found any contradictions in it and I said I I I know one thing I know the Bible to be true I says that everything that God ever promised me came to pass I said everything that God ever I ever asked God of come on in faith believing God did exactly what he said he'll do whether it come to Healing blessings or whatever I said I said but I begin to talk to him about being saved but I felt the presence of God come because now it wasn't just it wasn't the crowd wasn't there it's just me and him talking so he was saying when I began to talk to him about being saved he says I ain't never been saved before so I was telling charlet I said you know the thing about it is I believe if I had just a little bit more time he'd have been wanting to get baptized right then but I said all that say this I said you know sometimes you know in times past we might have did a little handle it a little different but I said God the young young man I believe he's hungering for something but when you don't you can't satisfy what that hunger is a Hungry Man a Hungry Man will eat anything come on but I believe that inside of there is still a candidate come on for Christ to save inside of but I want to say sometimes stuff happen to people and that's why they are the way they are but I thank God that it don't have to be sometimes all this deep and drastic things but when his presence comes it's just a simple word comes in but it changes things in the people life to they want more Hallelujah come on and he wants to give you more if you open the door and let them in y'all believe that tonight Hallelujah but I says out of weakness come on out of weakness the the
