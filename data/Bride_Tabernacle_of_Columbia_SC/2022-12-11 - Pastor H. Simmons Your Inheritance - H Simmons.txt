I read the first year read the next we'll read the last verse together Blessed Be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ for having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pledge of his will six and whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace eight having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purpose in himself 10. and whom also we have attained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will twelve in whom ye also trusted after ye have heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom after ye after that ye believed you will sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise together which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory may God bless these words you may be seated God is good amen I want to talk to you about your inheritance this morning you you and I as children of God have an inheritance you know some of us have been haven't been born in you know some of the prominent families of the Earth and uh so you don't when you the your loved one your father died he may not have nothing to leave behind it perhaps at the best it might be in-house or maybe a car or something like that so your inheritance in this world Amen some people are privileged to receive millions of dollars and the yachts and vacation homes and you know slow cars so but most of us in here if we can get it you know the parents leave the house and maybe our automobile or something like that and maybe um maybe have a life insurance policy of ten or twenty thousand dollars and you may have a little something left over after the funeral but The Inheritance that we're talking about is incorruptible your inheritance is an eternal inheritance amen what the father our father has left his children are you with me you know I was so excited this morning I didn't know how I talked a little bit to brother Chapel because he usually get here early I was so excited I was down on my Niche praying and and I started thinking about my inheritance and not only did I think about it I I I I started feeling so good because you know when your mind uh forget about this world and this life here but think about what God has in store for you amen how blessed we are to be saved you know I thought about all those that made me have drunk wine or alcohol or whatever or gotten high and I thought about I said you know I wouldn't exchange what God has given us for no wine no alcohol no joint or none of that stuff amen because God has given us amen such an incredible gift the Bible says in in the 13th in whom after you trusted in whom also you trust and after ye heard the word of gospel the truth of the Gospel your gospel your salvation in whom after that you believe ye will sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise I I wonder the earnest of your inheritance what God has invested and what God has given us right now you know I I know we got something that we're looking forward to in the future but I started feeling amen my inheritance it made me feel so good to know what I have Amen in the inside I mean it's real it's it's not just a feeling it's a possession God has given us amen favor Hallelujah I mean I can't explain it you got to you know it's like the man was eating the apple and he says you know or whatever he says is it sweet you can't testify whether it's sweet or bitter because you're not eating it but if you took a bite of it you'd know with the sweeter better isn't that right it's just like God if you never experienced the power and the love of God in a real genuine way but if you ever get it [Music] if you ever experience it right you wouldn't sell it out for nothing somebody said I would take nothing from my journey you have an inheritance let me let me in the 14th verse he said which is the earnest of your inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his glory wherefore our soul after that you've heard after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give you given to you unto you spiritual Spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that's what we're missing the wisdom in Revelation in the knowledge of him that's what it's missing that God would give it to you see we've spent our time as Christians worrying about things that does not matter the devil would always keep your mind entangled with the fans of this life he will keep you looking at the the five sentences and what we feel the affection conscious memory and all of that imagination but if you can ever think about amen what God has what you inherited from God your inheritance oh God it'll turn you away from all the things that Fades away these temporal things but the things that are Eternal that's the things that matter amen this life is only but for a moment it's a little while it's like a fire flower amen it's like grass and wiggles like the flowers they faded but one thing about the God what he gives us is eternal he said the eyes of your understanding excuse me now the 18th verse out of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of your his calling and what is the what riches are what the glory of the inheritance ways it I'll tell you if it's not in you then you don't know what you're missing The Riches of his
