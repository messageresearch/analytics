you for all your grace and your mercy towards us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray we give these things Lord in Jesus name amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Philippians by the grace of God Philippians 1. it won't be long tonight Philippians 1. you gotta say man and it reads Paul and timotheus the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi which with the Bishops and deacons Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for all for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ even as it is me for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel ye all are partakers of my grace my God it'll bless your reading of his words you may be seated tonight by the grace of God just for a few moment moments tonight I just want to talk to you on a little something I just just kind of just talk to you for a moment and I entitled it of finished work amen a finished work you know the things that God does God never started nothing that he wasn't able to finish God never saved a person and then tomorrow say I have to lose that person but I believe that you know just like he says in the scriptures all the fathers given him will come and he never lost one so that's the Assurance you know it's something about walking walking with the confidence knowing that you know the thing that God uh started he's able to finish you know Paul you know a lot of times in the scriptures he was trying to convince the people or to persuade them that you know God is able to take care of you God is able to handle your situation your trial God is going to take care of you because there's a lot of times we find ourselves constantly encouraging the people that that you know we struggling sometimes at the small things we we um struggle sometimes that happen to Faith in the in the smallest things to understand that God is he is God he's he's able to take care of it I says you know it's but when you're walking with the confidence I was sharing the other day I said you know the God we serve in your situation your trial all in a moment God is he's always able all in the moment God can turn that thing around and he could have been turned around whenever he whenever he desired to turn around but sometimes he lets things linger just to see our reaction sometimes he lets things linger because we got things that in us that he's trying to work out work out of us so at that time when when the time is right God can God will step up and he'll turn that thing around so a lot of times we we got things we struggle we battle with we face with you know and sometimes they seem to be lingering but are we seeking God to ask God sometimes what Lord what do I have to do God am I doing something to stand in the way of my Deliverance of you delivering Lord am I if I'm doing something or or isn't in a certain place God what do I need to do and sometimes that's what God has taken us to because he knew the whole God know the whole time but he wants to get you to that place the way you say Lord what do I have to do come on and sometimes we already know those things amen but we find I said you know you try to encourage people the people struggled a lot of times you know God can do things great Deliverance bring great Deliverance in a person's life but all the all the journey they're still struggling with the very beginning the the root the foundation they very they're very struggling with that sometimes all through their Journey the devil keep bringing things to them and then they doubting whether they saved or not doubting whether they've been filled with the Holy Ghost or not but what it is that's because the devil keeps you into that place he don't want you to get it settled within your spirit to understand that look I gave it to God I gave my life to God I belong to him so I'm not going to struggle at these small things I'm gonna go on to the deeper things in God you know well we find that we find that many times I says you know God God is able God is able to finish your work I like how Paul said in many of places and we won't be able to go there for for the time's sake tonight but Paul in many places he was like I like how he was talking about in uh Romans 8 and he was talking about you know the God that foreknews he already predestinated us already called us already Justified us and glorified us you know he's going on talking about those things so he began to say you know just encouraging the people that you know who can lay in charge of God's elect it's God as I was sharing the other day I said you know we talk about the accuser the devil is accusing you but even though the devil is accusing you don't you know that God is your lawyer God is your lawyer God is the judge and he's sitting on the jury board I was sharing with them that the other day I said God is your loyal and he's also your judge and he's also the jury not the accuser the devil is up there accusing you day and night right but you going into a case that you already won yes you are already guilty you guilty from the womb you're guilty you came into this world sinner born ready to die right but God has already paved the way he's already made a way for you he already foreknew you he already Justified you called you come on glorified you know all these things that's why Paul said I'm persuaded that neither life nor death Angels principalities Powers any of those things can separate us from the love of God because it wasn't my choosing that chose him but it was him that chose me I might have struggled with that growing it in my life but somewhere along the line it had to drop down and register in your spirit that I belong to God I don't belong to the devil I was born into this world a certain place in certain conditions but I I wasn't of this world I was in the mind of God God foreknew me and that's why you know it was something inside of my heart could say yes Lord or say Amen to the word or something inside of my spirit can register to the to the supernatural things because I was a part of him I didn't recognize it but something quick and uh down in your spirit and that's what it that's what's got to happen it's got to go more than just uh uh to the intellectual uh Place realm of your mind because that ain't gonna that ain't gonna give you that quickening power that ain't gonna give you that overcoming power but something something supernatural has to take place to Quicken you you know Peter and all those they can uh be with Jesus with all the miracle signs and wonders and even he was trans figured in front of them and they said because he told him Peter said I believe that you're the Messiah and all these things and and Jesus told him I'm he they can see that they can see all the miracle signs and wonders but yet when it came down for him to go to Calvary or came down for them to confess him if it was going to cost them their life they couldn't do it and the reason why they couldn't do it because they didn't have the spirit of God yet come on the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet but when the Holy Ghost come it's more than just you knowing him just from uh that uh physical standpoint or being all that but when the Holy Ghost come he come and baptize it's come on the inside of you and baptize you that's him in you living his life through you're no longer Twain but you and God become one you can't deny him because to deny him you have to deny your own self right and for him to deny deny you he'd have to deny himself because you are part of him right come on I believe that with all of my heart that's why it says you know after the day of Pentecost that same one that denied him now can stand up and says men and brother and these men ain't drunk as you suppose but this is that come on a revelation had opened up that they could not only just read the letter of the word but they could see it through the eyes of the spirit and recognize they can see the very word being manifest before them they knew where they were in the scriptures and don't you know the people the the the Church of that day the Pharisees and all those got mad with Peter and all those because of what it is they was they had they had the scriptures they had all those things but they couldn't see it when it was manifested before them they couldn't put it in its place but Peter and all those they knew exactly where they were in time they knew exactly what they were expecting and that's why he said they said men and brother what shall we do he says repent come on now it's the number one thing wasn't it the repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of your sins and he said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a promise come on and God don't God can't break his promises that's one thing you try to convince God tell the people God can't break his promises God God keeps all his promises the work that he started he's able to finish what hinders a lot of time God for moving is your unbelief you'll doubt you know a lot of times you know the Bible says who have to believe in our report and whom is the arm of the Lord reveal come on God when he came when Jesus came you know the prophet of God talking about him being God's Masterpiece he whipped the devil on every on every circumstance every every situation God had something for the devil on every Circle every situation God has something for the devil didn't he he had the word was going to exposing the word was going to fight your battle in every situation and that's what I like I said God it ain't no temptation that ever came that you ain't already not handled you ain't already you know it's nothing new Under the Sun all these demons we fighting come on God has already conquered them for us he's already uh Victor we're already Victorious because the God has already whipped the devil ain't nothing new Under the Sun say God you ain't never any is not nothing you say God ain't never seen before God no he knows all those things don't he come on but we don't stumble at those things that's why I like how David well he's talking about the Lord is my shepherd you know because he's seen some dark nights didn't he yeah though I walked through the valley and the shadow of death he seen those dark nights but he said he didn't have to be worried about it walking through those dark nights because God was with him because he knew that the same Shepherd that lead him in the day is the same one that leading him in the night the same one Hallelujah that that that that Shepherd that Good Shepherd that knows the sheep and calleth them by name and lead them out he's going to lead me through those dark hours he's going to lead me through those lonely nights you know one thing about it when that Lord first saved me I learned early in the Christian journey I I said that you know like the scripture says when your mother and father forsake you the Lord will take you up I learned early in the Christian Journey that there is no friend like the Lola Jesus when you didn't have nobody that want to talk to you nobody that wanted to be your friend I learned early in in those hours that Jesus was right there with me all the time that he was my friend when I don't have nobody that like they say I convinced to I learned early in the Christian Journey that I convinced the God and not only will he hear hear me and just listen to me but he he was able to take care of all of that he was able to let me know that look cast all your cares upon me because I care for you take my yoke upon you and learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light I learned that early in the Christian journey and I'm even learning it now that God I got to release these things these heartaches this pain this struggle these battles all it is is the devil trying to stop you he don't want you to praise God he don't want you to give God thanks he don't want you to be happy righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost he want to take all those things away but the understanding that God I don't have to carry them because you already carry them for me my job is to come in the house of the Lord with a smile on my face with Thanksgiving in my heart to praise God that's my job come on no matter what I'm faced with body reckon with pain come on he was wounded for our transgression bruised fried iniquities the chastising of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and that's in the face of any demon anything any any sickness any other bring the devil bring all these spirits and that's all it is give it whatever kind of name they want to give it ain't nothing but a demon a devil a Tormentor from the pits of Hell come to torment you but God has delivered us from the Tormentor you don't have to be tormented but his righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost and that's what I want to live in that's what I want to dwell in Hallelujah but the devil don't took the joy from people that took the joy and the peace and all those things got your word blood pressure up nerve shot that's the world we living in men's hearts are failing for fear but God is the one he's the one to fix that heart he's the one to take that shaky place and make it stable he's the one to take those lonely nights and make them nights of rest come on peace be still the wind blowing all those things the Bible said it was crying for fear but he says peace be still I don't know about you but sometimes in those nights I whisper to myself peace be still Hallelujah be still God is here I'm gonna let God work I'm gonna let God take care of that situation when I don't know what to do I'm gonna give it to God let God handle it because he's already he's already done it hallelujah oh Jesus it's a finished work come on the problem like I said is why God sometimes oh oh oh it ain't that God can't finish a job God never started nothing he couldn't finish it ain't that that he's a failure it's just our own belief you know I thought about Israel God took Israelite to take them in didn't he he brought him out to take him in now the god that brought him out with all these Mighty signs and wonders he was able to take them in wasn't he it wasn't them that brought themselves out but it was God that brought them out and that same God that brought him out was able to take him in but they stumbled along the way didn't they through unbelief always complaining always whining them talk about what they don't have and how it used to be yeah how it used to be when you was in bondage but now God has set you free and the devil still show you things that you don't have but what if God would have never came and delivered you God would have never came by and saw about you come on what kind of a shape you were in bad shape that's why I say God I I don't praise you just for materialistic things or the things that I I got that that don't determine my praise whether I have or don't have I almost feel praise God Hallelujah long as I still got breath lungs good lungs some people don't have good lungs some people can't even raise their voice and say hallelujah some people can't do that some people can't say thank you Jesus they can't do it but God has given us good lungs to praise him with and that's what I intend to do give God praise Hallelujah Jesus come on God is good ain't he ain't God good he's a good God you know that he's able I'll try to convince someone that don't you know what you work God is able to take care of you he brought you out he's able to take you in come on but they stumbled at that didn't he God don't God don't save you to lose you come on God's salvation the the the the that needs to be settled God began the good work he's able to finish it you know they're saying that song uh he brought me from a mighty long way he brought me from a mighty long way come on and I got this far up and I'm a doubt God now out of all the the He's Able you got to be persuaded like Paul said he's able to finish the work God that brought you he's able to keep you and take you on the rest of the way I know we keep repeating that but I gotta we gotta drive it home sometime He's Able he's able to finish it that Journey that you started on that path that when God lit your fire and you were running because you were on fire come on but it was your job to keep the fire going God lit the fire but it's your job to keep it going Hallelujah but somewhere along the line you're letting it go out and wonder why you don't have joy wonder why the peace is gone where's the fire where is that burning desire that you had to pray the reason Bible where's that desire God stir us up again stir up that fire again that's my desire y'all believe that tonight Hallelujah but he's able say God is able come on it's a finished work God don't finish the work you know that you know that's why those those Israel Israel when they came out you know they they never wrestled with I mean they never could stop from wrestling with that it was a completed work that God he brought you out just like he said he was right he came and visited you and he told you I'm gonna bring you into the land of good land flowing with milk and honey God kept the first part of the promise but he can't keep the second part come on it's already finished God already settled it the first part he's able to keep he was able to keep he's able to keep the second part it's Giants in the land come on but they're unbelief said what we in our own eyes as grasshoppers come on looking at the things that they saw which crippled them from having faith in God because they was looking at the things that they saw but Joshua and Caleb didn't look at those things they believed that the same guard that took us out he's able to carry us in we don't have I don't have a strategy we don't know how but I do know that he's still got all this power he ain't lost not an ounce of his power his power is still the same and don't you know that no matter how much the was going on today the Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday the day of forever come on only thing only thing it is is that we got more stuff now to cause us to cause unbelief to come the things that we we got access to more things now that'll cause us to not believe God but if those things weren't accessible to you you wouldn't have no other choice but to have faith in God Hallelujah then like they said where is your faith come on what's your faith been in God to try you you say God I believe you got to try you by that he knows he'll try you by that come on let's see where your faith is but if your faith is in him alone in the trial in the midst of all that you ain't gonna go stumble or fall all those things come on those things shake away from me you'll say Lord I know my faith was in you then and my faith is still in you now I believe you come on that you're able to finish the work God is able come on how many believe that tonight come on he's able to finish I like how the Bible talks about Abraham stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief come on but he was persuaded fully persuaded that God was able to perform that what she promised come on he knew that the god that started it was the one able to finish it y'all believe that tonight it's a finish work you know Jesus Jesus knew you know what it would take to get us there he knew what it would take to get us to that place that that he envisioned of us and saw us in his mind he knew what it would take but he didn't never start nothing like we says and I couldn't go there for the sake of time that he wasn't able to finish he knew what it would take he knew it would take him coming down being rejected of his own he knew that he knew it would take him being lied on cheated spit on well he knew he knew what it was going to take to finish that work to get us but he knew that if he if he didn't go that place go that route come on then you and I wouldn't be saved today but he never started nothing that he can't finish so when he was going through you know some people said he should have called down a legion of Angels or hire any errors he should have done this or whatever but no he wanted to finish the work many times he could have destroyed the world over and over and over because of sin but he didn't you know what he did he had you and I in his mind he had a Plan of Redemption you and I were lost he wanted to redeem us he wanted to save us and bring us back to him we didn't even understand that plan we didn't know nothing about it we were alienated from God by Wicked Works come on all our lives coming in we were walking in transgression not even thinking about God but when we were in trespassing sin God still died for us God was working when we didn't think about him God was working something out because he knew that one day he was gonna have to answer and stand before God so he was working something out the Plan of Redemption come on he knew that what it would cost he knew what it would take but yet he did it anyway and then when he hung on that cross he said Lord it's finished he finished the work he didn't leave nothing undone he finished it and all whosoever will let him come I finished the work I'm gonna take care of you I settled it forever I got you Hallelujah I like that he finished the work how many believe that tonight come on it's a finished work don't struggle at the small things at the beginning come on once you wrestle your mind God God it isn't just by happening God chose me just just by happening that I chose him but he chose me this is something that he done I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I belong to him I'm settling with that Hallelujah it ain't in what I can do for him is what he already done for me now I'm going on to the deeper things in God I ain't struggling with that no more I'm going on to the deeper things and God I'm going in places in him because I want to I want to know more about it I want him to express himself a little bit more to me Hallelujah I'm going on Hallelujah felt like singing believe I testify while I have a chance I may not have this chance anymore amen but I believe I'll testify we thank God for the word tonight we we know there's much ground and territory to cover and we got a short time to do what God called you and I to do amen is Souls that are dying and going to hell and God is ordained you to speak to him to be a witness to them and if you don't be that witness to them God will hold you responsible and hold you chargeable for The Souls of those that you had an opportunity to tell them about the love of God tell them how good God is to you and what he's done for you you'll be responsible for that soul that you fail to tell about the love of God you know anything that you know is a blessing to you you might uh it's a certain restaurant and you ate at that restaurant and you go and you you all excited about it you tell others you go to that restaurant the food is so delicious and maybe a a great sale at the grocery store tell everybody that's a great sale you call around and tell your friends and neighbors there's a great sale go go down get that sale or save a lot of money I know in those family members you tell everybody God has to be so good to you you have to know that God is so good that you don't want you want everybody to have taste and see how good he is if he's good enough oh Hallelujah he said after the Holy Ghost you come upon you you shall have power and you shall be what you're witness but see a lot of folks say I got the Holy Ghost but they don't do no witnessing it's something wrong so tonight we thank God for the word we had a call from sister uh young since she said brother Bill is in the hospital he's been there for a few days and we pray with her over the phone and he's having it's hard needed to get regulated and whatever regulated and we don't want to pray for Brother Bill and sister Junction just pray to God just regulate everything and we believe in God and trusting God for that and um I was telling different ones to come on out

confess your faults one to another and pray one for another Lord I want to confess to you Lord because when I want to take communion I want to take it with a clear conscience Lord God if anything that the Lord God have done anything that hinders the Lord that's in our spirit Lord amen maybe Lord God I'm not even conscious of it Lord but you know it Lord help us Lord forgive us Lord help us Lord and Lord if I need to get something right Lord I want to make it right but you know my our hearts tonight father in Jesus name my Lord bless the continuation of the service tonight in Jesus name we pray amen God is good the book of First Corinthians 11 chapter and 23rd verse God is good amen I remember we came up and on especially just before Easter we always had Friday night everybody was up confessing their false and I can see the some of the sisters go get sister so and so on they take her in the back or in the room and they said sister son get that straightened so and so on get that straight and everybody had to get straight they didn't want to take communion to every channel is clear you got all all in your heart against a brother sister everybody's getting clear you know those days ain't passed God is still the same amen and then now those that you know if the Bible said if we don't take communion you have no part with me amen and then if you're taking on Worthy then your dad it's a damnation to your soul so you ain't got no way out are you with me so you got to take it if you're going to take it take it right isn't that right you identify with him as a Christian so you need to take communion because you're identified with him as a Christian Lord I'm in this together with Christ are you with me now it says First Corinthians 11 and 23 for I receive of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed to Morin and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you just doing remember to me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had such sin this cup is the New Testament in my blood just do ye in as often as you drink it and remember to me suppose when they were coming out the Wilderness they say well I don't I I I'm not going to take I'm not gonna of that lamb in the blood and so forth I I I'm just I just ain't gonna do it there are people that don't those people had no choice if they wanted the deaf Angel to pass over them then they were certain amen that the Passover this is the Passover when I see the blood I'll pass over you are you with me so let's not take it light let's take it serious and sincere amen because some people for three people take it so light I ain't got to take it no but we want to identify with him because his blood was shedded for us and when in his death in his that he died for us and when we take communion we're doing it because it is what he commanded us to do are you with me just like we get baptized because that's what we're supposed to do we wash feet because he said Peter said Lord you never wash my feet he said but if I watch you not you have no power with me he said not my feet only but you can watch me all over are you with me so what happens Christians look like they want to avoid things now are you with me let's be faithful to God and identify with his suffering the cross okay 25th verse in the same manner he took the cup and when he had such saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood just just do ye as often you drink in what members of me when they left Egypt they were to keep the Passover isn't that right and I'll pass over lamb which is Jesus Christ the sacrifice for us and we don't they saw the need and the seriousness of the Passover amen and they still acknowledge that to this day coming out of Egypt but we've come out of sin are you with me God has not covered our sin but he's actually annihilated took it completely out of the way he said you're sending the negatives well I remember no more we were bondage and bondage to sin but God has freed us and giving us eternal life and we recognize Lord as often you do this let's remember Capri let's remember what he done on the cross for us oh that oh we take it lightly now let's not take it lightly let's take it to heart and tell God how much we appreciate what he does Lord if you hadn't done that I'll still be a sinner there's no way for me to get back to God I couldn't have eternal life but Lord look what you've done for me for example you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he what till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinking unworldly eating and drinking damnation to himself not Discerning the what for this cause many a weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be con judge but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be what condemn with the world well for my brethren when you come together to eat tear one for another and if any man hunger let him what that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come God bless amen let us just be mindful and pray for the tonight as we continue to communion service let us just stand brother Ernest bird call and different ones come and help let us stand brother Butler we glad
