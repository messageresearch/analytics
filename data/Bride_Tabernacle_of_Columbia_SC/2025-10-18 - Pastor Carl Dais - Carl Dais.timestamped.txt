[33:40] We thank you for our lives
[33:43] that we live before you.
[33:46] And Lord, as we at this junction of
[33:49] time,
[33:52] we need your grace tonight.
[33:55] We need your mercy tonight.
[33:58] We need your love tonight.
[34:01] As we minister to your bride tonight,
[34:04] the purchase of your blood tonight.
[34:08] We thank you tonight
[34:10] for all things. Lord,
[34:13] we thank you tonight for Pastor Simmons
[34:17] and the saints of God tonight.
[34:19] [Music]
[34:21] What a people of God
[34:24] that we stand before. Lord,

[34:34] to fill with your spirit,
[34:37] to do what you want to do tonight.
[34:41] It'll be pleasing to us, Lord. For we
[34:44] thank you and commit all things into
[34:46] your hands. For we love you now in
[34:50] Jesus' name.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; As we stand tonight,
[34:58] the book of 1 Corinthians
[35:02] 9th chapter.
[35:05] Amen. Amen.
[35:09] and 13th verse.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; You have it say amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:29] And it reads, "Do ye not
[35:32] Do you not know that they which minister
[35:36] about holy things live of the things of
[35:39] the temple?
[35:42] And they which wait at the altar are
[35:46] partakers with the altar.
[35:49] Even so hath the Lord ordained,
[35:53] that they which preach the gospel should
[35:56] live the gospel, live of the gospel. But
[36:00] I have used none of these things,
[36:02] neither have I written these things that
[36:05] it should be so done unto me. For it
[36:09] were better for me to die than any man
[36:12] should make my glorying void.
[36:16] For though I preach the gospel, I have
[36:18] nothing to glory of. For necessity is
[36:21] laid upon me, yay, woe unto me if I
[36:24] preach not the gospel. For if I do this
[36:28] thing willingly, I have a reward.
[36:32] But if against my will a dispensation of
[36:36] the gospel is committed unto me,
[36:39] what is my reward then? Verily, that
[36:42] when I preach the gospel, I may make the
[36:45] gospel of Christ without charge, that I
[36:49] abuse not my power in the gospel. May
[36:53] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[36:55] of his word. You may be seated.
[37:00] Amen.
[37:04] for a few seconds, a few minutes. I just
[37:06] want to say a few things before I go
[37:09] into the
[37:11] minister the word.
[37:14] Tonight
[37:17] is me and my wife
[37:19] 33rd anniversary.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] [Applause]
[37:27] We met on this night 33 years ago. Amen.
[37:32] But I 30th anniversary was August 5th.
[37:36] Amen.
[37:37] 33 years ago. I looked back and I said,
[37:39] "Honey,
[37:41] got a little gray."
[37:44] Amen. And I also, you know, want to
[37:47] thank the Simmons family and them for
[37:50] accepting me into the family. Amen. With
[37:54] open arms. And I also want to say,
[37:57] Pastor Simmons,
[38:00] I appreciate you.
[38:02] a big brother, a father, a uncle in the
[38:04] gospel of Jesus Christ. I love you.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. From the depths of my heart. Amen.
[38:11] It's He's inspired me. And a lot of
[38:14] things that I do in Camden is come from
[38:17] his upbringing. He inspired me. I just
[38:21] had to learn how to be a little easier.
[38:24] And generations are changing now. So,
[38:26] you got to be a little easier and work
[38:28] with people. But I just thank God for
[38:31] his grace down in Camden. And every time
[38:34] I see the church growing or doing
[38:35] something, I think about Pastor Simmons
[38:37] and his rearing up as Paul said uh to
[38:41] Timothy, my son in the gospel of Jesus
[38:44] Christ. And I look as a father in the
[38:47] gospel. Amen.
[38:49] God bless you. As Paul said,
[38:54] sometimes I need these things here.
[38:59] Do ye not know that they which minister
[39:01] of holy things live of the things of the
[39:04] temple? And they which wait at the altar
[39:08] are partakers of the altar.
[39:11] Our thought tonight, the cross of
[39:14] Calvary. We've been working on that
[39:17] series for a little while, the cross of
[39:19] Calvary. But when we look at the cross,
[39:22] we look at something's crucified.
[39:26] When we look at the cross, we look at a
[39:29] life that's crucified.
[39:31] We look at something that is centered on
[39:35] crucifixion.
[39:37] And crucifixion represents death.
[39:42] Death to self. And I said, Lord, as my
[39:45] journey in the ministry, I said, Lord,
[39:48] the more things I go through, I look at
[39:52] dying out.
[39:54] and you think you're dead and then God
[39:56] just sends something else to kill you
[40:00] even more.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And as you die,
[40:05] it generates such a love
[40:08] for your enemies.
[40:11] It generates such a power
[40:14] that I said, Lord, we're tapping into
[40:17] something that when love abides for your
[40:21] enemy, for people that may dislike you.
[40:24] When you begin to tap into that ministry
[40:27] of love,
[40:29] suffering has to take you there. As the
[40:32] prophet said to one of the brothers, the
[40:34] Lord has to put you up here. I can't
[40:36] take you up here. The Lord put me up
[40:38] here. So in our Christian journey as a
[40:41] crucified Christian, the Lord has to
[40:44] take us from glory to glory by his
[40:47] spirit. And we look at Paul ministry as
[40:50] Paul was ministering. Paul began to tell
[40:52] him in Corinthians, I'm a Hebrew of a
[40:55] Hebrew. I'm of the stock of Benjamin,
[40:57] the tri stock of Israel, the tribe of
[40:59] Benjamin. I was circumcised the eighth
[41:02] day. He could tell people that he sat
[41:04] under the feet of Gion. But when he got
[41:06] to the end of his ministry, when he went
[41:08] into the prison, he write a letter back
[41:10] to Filimon and he said, "I got Onimus
[41:14] converted in here and I'm sending him
[41:16] back to you with a letter of love." Paul
[41:19] had not only began to be an apostle, but
[41:22] he said, "Now I'm a prisoner of the
[41:25] Lord."
[41:26] &gt;&gt; So when you're a prisoner tonight of the
[41:29] Lord, nothing that somebody say or do to
[41:32] you bothers you. And God begin to take
[41:36] you down that road that you know that
[41:39] all things are possible to them that
[41:42] believe. Why? Because the cross of
[41:45] Calvary tonight is still permeating in
[41:48] our heart. And we see the blood every
[41:51] time we go through our sacrifices and
[41:53] our trials, we see that blood has been
[41:56] reinvented in our heart. That what he
[41:59] done at Calvary still lives in our
[42:02] heart. Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 1
[42:10] and 18,
[42:12] he said, "For the preaching of the cross
[42:15] is to them that perish foolishness, but
[42:17] unto us which are saved, it is the power
[42:20] of God."
[42:22] &gt;&gt; See, the preaching of the cross is the
[42:24] power of God to you and I.
[42:29] that cross tonight.
[42:31] The Bible says in Isaiah 53, "Who have
[42:34] believed our report and to whom the arm
[42:36] of the Lord has been revealed?"
[42:40] &gt;&gt; See that cross tonight, it keeps us to a
[42:43] place that when you think you are
[42:45] somebody, when you look back at what God
[42:48] has done for you, you recognize it was
[42:50] only grace.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; You recognize that it was only the mercy
[42:55] of God that you are where you are at.
[42:58] Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "For the preaching of the cross
[43:03] is of them that perish foolishness, but
[43:05] unto us which are saved. It is the power
[43:08] of God. For it is written, I will
[43:10] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[43:12] bring to nothing the understanding of
[43:14] the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is
[43:16] the strive? Where's the disputer of this
[43:18] world? Have not God made the foolish the
[43:21] wisdom of this world? For after that the
[43:24] wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
[43:27] not God? For it pleased God by the
[43:29] foolishness of preaching to save them
[43:31] that believe.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; By the foolishness of preaching to save
[43:35] you and I.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; The foolishness of preaching to save
[43:39] them that believe.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; For the Jews require a sign and the
[43:43] Greeks seek after the wisdom. But we
[43:45] preach Christ what? Crucified.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; We preach him crucified. Because when
[43:50] the crucified savior is in your life, it
[43:54] takes you to a place of dying out that
[43:57] you know is not your ability no more,
[43:59] but it's the power of the resurrection.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Corinthians, I didn't come
[44:05] to you with excellency or speech or men
[44:06] with, but I come demonstrating the power
[44:09] of the resurrection.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; He could come with knowledge.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; He could come with a lot of stuff.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I didn't come to you like
[44:17] that." Let's go to Corinthians 2. Just
[44:20] one page over two and one. And I,
[44:23] brethren, when I came to you,
[44:26] I came not with excellency or speech or
[44:29] of wisdom, declare unto you the
[44:30] testimony of God. For I determined not
[44:34] to know anything among you, save Jesus
[44:36] Christ, and him what?
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Crucified.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; See, Paul wanted to see the crucified
[44:41] savior in their life.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to know how smart they
[44:44] was or what was going on in the church.
[44:47] He wanted to know, was you part of that
[44:50] crucified?
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And I was with you in weakness and in
[44:58] fear and in much trembling. And my
[45:01] speech and my preaching was not with
[45:03] enticing words of man wisdom, but in
[45:05] demonstration of the spirit and what?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Power.
[45:11] That your faith should not stand in the
[45:13] wisdom of a man, but in the power of
[45:15] what? How be it we speak wisdom among
[45:18] them that are perfect. Yet not the
[45:20] wisdom of this world, nor the princes of
[45:22] this world that come to know, but we
[45:24] speak wisdom of God in a what? Mystery.
[45:27] And see that mystery, you can't see that
[45:29] mystery until the Christ has been
[45:31] crucified and the rigger mortar has set
[45:34] in. That's when you can see the mystery.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, I got a mystery. I
[45:39] know this and know that." No, the
[45:41] mystery of Christ is that you die. And
[45:44] when you died, God began to dispatch his
[45:46] love to you. That's why they could spit
[45:49] on him at the cross. He said, "If you be
[45:52] the son of God, come down from the cross
[45:54] and save us and save yourself." He had
[45:58] love on his mind.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He had continual love on his heart for
[46:04] you and I. They stabbed him, they
[46:06] whipped him, they spit on him, but he
[46:07] had love.
[46:10] That's why Paul when he got that love,
[46:12] he could be whipped and beat and left
[46:14] for dead outside of the city and get up
[46:16] and run to the next city telling
[46:18] somebody about the goodness of the Lord.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; But we speak wisdom of God in the
[46:29] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[46:31] God ordained before the world unto our
[46:33] glory, which none of the princes of this
[46:35] world knew. For had they known it, they
[46:37] wouldn't have crucified the Lord of
[46:38] glory.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; See, the princes don't know what's going
[46:41] on now.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Then I told the guy, I said, "You know
[46:44] what? Everybody's fighting about the
[46:46] United States. Who can stay here?" I
[46:49] said, "But y'all can have this place."
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Hand up with a bunch of robbers and
[46:52] liars and adulterers and fornicators and
[46:54] killers. Y'all can have this place. You
[46:57] trying to run everybody back to their
[46:58] own country. I said, "We going to a
[47:00] country that flowed with milk.
[47:03] We going to a country that don't have no
[47:05] water no more. The Bible says in
[47:07] Revelation, it won't be no more sea and
[47:09] it won't be no more sun or moon because
[47:11] he'll be the light of the city.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and run all you want to run out
[47:14] of this city. I'mma will willfully
[47:16] leave.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; I'mma willfully leave.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I'mma willfully leave. Why? Cuz no man
[47:21] can break in and rob us can steal
[47:24] &gt;&gt; where we going.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But still yet, who who want to say who
[47:28] who's supposed to be here anyway?
[47:31] Only God knows who's supposed to be
[47:33] here. The ones that were predestinated
[47:35] to eternal life.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That's the ones that were supposed to be
[47:38] here.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Now look what he says. The wisdom of God
[47:42] in the mystery, none of the prince, but
[47:44] as it is written, I have not seen nor
[47:46] ear heard, neither have entered into the
[47:48] heart of man the things which God have
[47:50] prepared for them that what?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Now we going back to love.
[47:54] So not a crucified savior, what Calvary
[47:58] done for you and I, that love draws us
[48:01] into complete fellowship and submission
[48:05] as a prisoner.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; See, Paul went from one degree to a
[48:09] next, but Paul ended up, he said, I am a
[48:12] prisoner of the Lord.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; So when you're a prisoner, that mean
[48:17] you're handcuffed,
[48:18] &gt;&gt; hand and feet, maybe sh back, but when
[48:22] you're a prisoner, They tell you when to
[48:24] get up.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; When you can go to bed. When you can
[48:27] eat.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; See, Paul was such a prisoner of the
[48:30] Lord that he was so bit on what God
[48:33] wanted to do. In the book of Acts, he
[48:35] was praying and the Lord said, "Show him
[48:38] a vision. I got some people over here.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Go over here."
[48:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; It was all about his will and not
[48:45] building himself his own kingdom. It was
[48:48] about the kingdom of God. And see, when
[48:50] the genuine love is there, it's not
[48:52] about who, but it's about the grace of
[48:55] God.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; What God wants done with his word.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And the bride, because she loved Jesus,
[49:00] she know what he wants done with the
[49:02] word. Why? Cuz she has been anointed by
[49:05] his spirit and the spirit revealth all
[49:07] things. Yeah. The deep things of God.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; So the deep things is coming to you by
[49:12] mystery. And now you know that how to
[49:15] please him.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] But God had revealed him to us by his
[49:21] spirit. For the spirit searches all
[49:22] things, yay, the deep things of God. For
[49:24] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[49:26] save the spirit of man which is in him.
[49:30] Even so the things of God knoweth no
[49:32] man, but the spirit of God. Now we have
[49:34] received not the spirit of the word, but
[49:35] the spirit of God, which is of God, that
[49:37] we might know the things that are freely
[49:39] given to us of God. See, you got to get
[49:41] in that place where you know what's
[49:44] freely yours.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:47] We got to stop playing church.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; We got to get get along and get with
[49:52] God.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; We got to know what God wants to do.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; God said, "Your faith can't go no
[49:57] further, son, until you get with me."
[49:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Your faith, the Bible says in Hebrews
[50:02] 11, now faith,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; amen,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; present tense. How? Now faith is the
[50:08] substance of things hoped for, the
[50:10] evidence of things what?
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Not seen. So now your faith is bringing
[50:14] things that are not seen in the visible
[50:16] tangibleness. It's bringing things into
[50:21] tangibleness. It's bringing things into
[50:24] your vision
[50:26] that wouldn't be seen
[50:29] that are seen now by you. The Bible said
[50:33] Abraham what saw things that was He knew
[50:37] that God was going to supply a lamb.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now. He knew that God was go
[50:42] going to give him a ram or something in
[50:44] the bush. He went to stab his son and it
[50:48] was a ram caught in the thicket. He knew
[50:50] his faith said if I kill him, God going
[50:53] to raise him up.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; See, he had faith to believe what God
[50:57] has ordained for him to do. Why? But
[50:59] because of his blood, it wasn't Abraham
[51:01] blood, but it was the blood of God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if that blood could work like
[51:05] that before the cross, what could it do
[51:07] the night after the cross
[51:09] &gt;&gt; in your life and mine? It could produce
[51:12] such love that'll generate the power of
[51:14] God. Uh you could you don't even have to
[51:16] get the tongues of prophecy. The love of
[51:18] God will cast out devils. Uh will heal
[51:21] the sick. Uh will save the lost. We'll
[51:23] restore the backslide. Uh will fill with
[51:25] the Holy Ghost. That's what love will
[51:27] do.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Love castes out all fear. Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Acts 2
[51:34] &gt;&gt; and 23.
[51:42] The cross,
[51:44] the blood of Jesus.
[51:47] Acts 2 and 23.
[51:56] And it says, I start at the 22nd verse.
[51:59] Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[52:01] Jesus of Nazareth, man approved of God
[52:03] by you by miracles and wonders and signs
[52:06] which God did by him in the midst of
[52:08] you.
[52:10] as ye yourselves also know him being the
[52:13] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[52:16] fornowledge of God. And ye have taken
[52:19] and by wicked hands have crucified and
[52:21] slain
[52:23] whom God has raised up having loosed the
[52:26] pains of death because it was not
[52:28] possible that he should be hold of it.
[52:30] For David speaketh concerning him, I
[52:32] forsaw the Lord always before my face
[52:35] for he is on my right hand that I should
[52:37] not be what? move.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; So if God is with you, you can't be
[52:40] moved tonight.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; If God is with you, you can't be moved
[52:44] tonight. Therefore, did my heart rejoice
[52:46] and my tongue was glad. Moreover, also
[52:48] my flesh did rest in hope because thou
[52:51] would not leave thy soul in hell.
[52:52] Neither would I suffer. Thy holy one to
[52:54] see corruption. See, they were talking
[52:56] to Paul in the New Testament in
[52:58] Corinthians. They said, "Is the cross?"
[53:00] Did somebody really die?
[53:03] Cross. Paul said if if he not been
[53:05] crucified then our faith is vain. But
[53:09] because he was crucified to the
[53:11] believers uh he's a resurrected inside
[53:13] of you uh he's living tonight inside of
[53:16] you because of the blood of Jesus. Uh
[53:19] and because of that blood tonight you
[53:22] can walk in newness of life. Uh you can
[53:24] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[53:26] Jesus Christ. Uh and you can be filled
[53:28] with his precious Holy Spirit. Uh and
[53:31] because of that life and because of that
[53:33] blood uh you can walk uh and you can
[53:36] tell somebody about the goodness of
[53:37] Jesus uh and the anointing would follow
[53:40] you uh to confirm his word. Uh the Bible
[53:43] said strong is he that executute his
[53:46] word. Uh he can execute his word in your
[53:48] life tonight. Uh that love might
[53:51] continue to abide. If you got any false
[53:54] or hated spirit, uh, or you need to make
[53:57] up with someone, uh, just look at what
[53:59] the cross done for you and I. There were
[54:02] two men standing at the cross, sitting
[54:04] on the cross with Jesus. Uh, and one
[54:06] said, "If you be the son of God, I'm
[54:10] wondering tonight whether you on the
[54:11] left or you on the right." Uh, there are
[54:14] two on the cross and the ones on the
[54:17] right. He said, "We're justly due for
[54:20] the reward that we have done." Uh we
[54:22] come to pay our debt for what we have
[54:24] done. Uh but the one on the left uh he
[54:27] said if you be the son of God uh oh God
[54:31] take us down from the cross and yourself
[54:33] uh and the one on the right said Lord uh
[54:37] when you get in your kingdom uh remember
[54:39] me uh when you get to your kingdom uh
[54:42] and Jesus turned to him and said uh the
[54:45] day you'll be with me in paradise uh and
[54:48] Peter said a day is a thousand years and
[54:52] a thousand years is one day and The Lord
[54:55] is not slack concerning his promises.
[54:58] You can bet on it tonight that he's not
[55:00] slack concerning his promises as some
[55:03] men count slackness, but is long
[55:06] suffering to usward who will believe. Uh
[55:09] but Peter said, uh this second epistle I
[55:12] now write unto you uh in which I stir up
[55:14] your pure minds by the way of
[55:17] remembrance. I come tonight to stir up
[55:20] your minds uh that the cross of Calvary
[55:23] is in plain view. Uh he's ushering you
[55:26] into the kingdom uh the kingdom of God.
[55:29] Uh cuz the Bible says in Ephesians uh it
[55:32] went to adoption to the redemption of
[55:34] our bodies. Uh you looking for an
[55:37] adoption tonight? You got to go on to
[55:40] the adoption uh where you can be placed
[55:42] in the body of Christ. Amen.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:13 said, "By one
[55:48] spirit, Holy Spirit, we are baptized
[55:50] into one body, and that's the body of
[55:53] Christ."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; If you're not baptized into that body
[55:56] tonight, that's the mythical body of
[55:58] Christ. It's not a church organization.
[56:00] It is the power of the resurrection.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; It is the power of Christ. And if you're
[56:06] baptized into that body, you got the
[56:08] same power that Jesus had.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Romans says, "If the same spirit that
[56:17] raised Jesus from the dead,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; if it dwell in you,
[56:21] &gt;&gt; he that raised up Christ shall also
[56:22] quicken your mortal bodies."
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I feel a quickening tonight.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the Holy Ghost is real
[56:29] tonight.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection is real
[56:32] tonight. God will show me something the
[56:35] day before and I get to work and it'll
[56:39] play out like a picture before me.
[56:42] I said, "Lord, look at here."
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm just coming to let you
[56:46] know, son,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; that I'm with you. I'm showing you
[56:49] what's taking place tomorrow
[56:51] &gt;&gt; on your job."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And people are part, they are actors
[56:57] in this
[56:59] &gt;&gt; picture.
[57:01] Jesus,
[57:03] the mighty God,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; met Moses in the burning bush.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Take off your shoes, Moses,
[57:10] where you stand in his holy ground.
[57:12] Genesis 3 said the head the head of the
[57:16] the feet shall bruise the head of the
[57:19] serpent and the serpent shall bruise his
[57:21] heel. That was the prophecy of Jesus
[57:24] Christ dying at Calvary. The woman's
[57:27] seed. We know the woman don't have a
[57:28] seed but it was the woman's seed which
[57:30] was Christ. When he come forth he said
[57:34] the veil of the temple is raining twain
[57:35] from top to bottom.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; What's the veil now? don't have to be no
[57:40] priest to go before God,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; but you and I.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; It don't have to be to preach no more.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Revelations, he made
[57:48] us kings and priests.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; So you can go to God.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; You cry out until a broken and a
[57:53] contrite spirit come. Until God come,
[57:55] you stay there.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Until the power come, you stay there.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And every time you need to revive, stay
[58:01] there till the power come.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I didn't come to you with
[58:06] excellence. I come in power." Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I come in demonstration.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I talked to some religious
[58:12] people. I said, "I need a God that I can
[58:13] feel."
[58:15] &gt;&gt; They said, "Man, I just preaching. I'm
[58:16] just preaching." Uhuh. I said, "I need a
[58:17] God to do something."
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; You ask your wife to do something and
[58:21] she do it. She She's performing what you
[58:23] asking. Right.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And we the wife of Jesus, right?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; If you ask him something, he's
[58:29] performing to do it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You need a God. You just don't just
[58:32] preach
[58:33] &gt;&gt; year in and year out. You got to see the
[58:34] power.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to see the anointing in
[58:37] your life.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; God has to medicate it.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; God, I'm going through something.
[58:42] Everything you take me to do something,
[58:43] but I got to see the power every now and
[58:45] then.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; I got to see something taking place.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Other than that, you don't know what
[58:51] you're doing.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; I was at the IG restaurant in Camden.
[58:57] 7day Adventist guy. Me and him get to
[58:59] talking.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And I he talked for a little while. Let
[59:03] him talk a good while. Then I started
[59:05] talking
[59:06] since he was so smart. I said, "What
[59:08] happened under the sixth seal?" He ain't
[59:10] even know. I said, "Now, all right. Now,
[59:13] don't act like you know everything."
[59:14] Now, tell me what happened under the
[59:15] sixth seal. Under the fifth seal, it
[59:16] wasn't no beast. You had the white,
[59:20] black, red, and pale.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Fifth seal, they said was no beast.
[59:24] Under the sixth seal said, "What
[59:25] happened to the sixth seal?"
[59:28] He didn't know. So, that's when the
[59:29] anointing hit me. I started preaching
[59:31] and jumping and everything.
[59:34] White lady come out. I did. She thought
[59:36] I was fighting that guy.
[59:40] That guy after we finished me and him
[59:42] hug one another. He said, "Preacher, I
[59:44] don't know what's going on with you." I
[59:45] said, "But you something hit you and
[59:47] you." He said, "I got to come see you."
[59:48] He probably 7th Day Advent. I told him
[59:50] all your religion. I said, "Tease
[59:52] Russell 7th Day Adventist." I said, "I
[59:55] studied your religion.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Knew everything about his religion.
[1:00:03] No, T. Russ is your witness.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; But I said, Lord,
[1:00:11] I thank you for your grace.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And I thank you for your mercy.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; And I thank you for your love.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; When you feel the anointing and the
[1:00:24] presence of God come upon your life, God
[1:00:27] come to help you. Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; He come to strengthen you.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; He come to anoint you.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; In your darkest hour.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; That's when God comes to reinforce
[1:00:39] your presence, his presence in your
[1:00:42] life.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, the cross,
[1:00:46] things may happen to you or transpire in
[1:00:49] your life.
[1:00:52] That's when the cross comes to reinforce
[1:00:56] who you are.
[1:00:57] He comes to reinforce what he has done
[1:01:00] for you and what he's doing for you
[1:01:03] right now. Matthew 27.
[1:01:14] Matthew 27 and 28.
[1:01:20] And they stripped him
[1:01:22] and put on him a scarlet robe.
[1:01:26] And when they had platted a crown of
[1:01:28] thorns,
[1:01:30] they put it upon his head
[1:01:33] and a reed in his what?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Right hand.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; And they bowed the knee before him and
[1:01:39] mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the
[1:01:41] what?"
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And they spit upon him
[1:01:45] and took the reed and smokeote him on
[1:01:48] the head.
[1:01:50] And after that they had mocked him, they
[1:01:52] took the robe off from him and put on
[1:01:56] his own raignment on him and led him
[1:01:59] away to what? Crucify him.
[1:02:02] And as they came out, they found a man
[1:02:05] ofSirene by name him they compared to
[1:02:08] bear what?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; His cross.
[1:02:12] And when they had come to a place called
[1:02:14] Golgatha, that is to say a place of his
[1:02:16] skull,
[1:02:18] they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled
[1:02:20] with Gaul.
[1:02:22] And when they had tasted there, he had
[1:02:24] tasted thereof, he would not drink. And
[1:02:27] they crucified him and parted what?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And casting lots that it might be
[1:02:33] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:02:35] prophet. They parted my garments among
[1:02:37] them, and upon my vesture they did what?
[1:02:40] Yes, Lord.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And sitting down, they watched him there
[1:02:45] and set over his head. This accusation
[1:02:49] written, "This is Jesus, the king of the
[1:02:52] what?"
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And they were two thieves crucified with
[1:02:56] him, one on the right hand, and another
[1:02:58] on the left. And they that passed by
[1:03:01] reviled him, wagging their heads,
[1:03:03] saying, Thou that destroyth this temple,
[1:03:06] and buildest it in three days, save
[1:03:08] thyself, if thou be the son of God, come
[1:03:11] down from the cross.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Likewise, the chief also priests,
[1:03:17] mocking him with the scribes and elders,
[1:03:19] saying, he saved others himself he
[1:03:21] cannot save.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; If he be the king of Israel, let him
[1:03:25] come down from the cross, and we will
[1:03:28] what? Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He trusted in God. Let him deliver him
[1:03:32] now if he will have him. For he said he
[1:03:35] was the son of God.
[1:03:38] Now the 23rd chapter of Luke, you can go
[1:03:41] where the two malifactors. They said
[1:03:43] what they had to say. 23 and 42 of Luke.
[1:03:47] They said what they had to say. One
[1:03:50] wanted
[1:03:52] to be saved and the other wanted to
[1:03:55] question Jesus authority.
[1:03:58] But I'm wondering tonight by his grace,
[1:04:04] what do you think about this cross of
[1:04:06] Calvary,
[1:04:09] this present time of your ministry?
[1:04:14] What do you think about the cross?
[1:04:17] Has the sufferings of your life draw you
[1:04:20] closer to Christ? Or the things that
[1:04:22] you've been through draw you closer to
[1:04:24] Christ?
[1:04:26] the trials, the suffering, the tests,
[1:04:28] the things that you've went through in
[1:04:29] your family, in your body. Has it drawn
[1:04:32] you closer to Christ?
[1:04:35] The objective and the motive is to get
[1:04:38] you in love with Jesus to a point that
[1:04:40] you become a prisoner of the cross.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You become a prisoner of Calvary.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] that you no longer want this world
[1:04:52] and the things of this world, but you
[1:04:55] want to be centered on Christ and his
[1:04:57] word.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Because one day we're going to have to
[1:05:01] leave this place.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You know, people think this is a place
[1:05:07] that you can stay.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; People think it's a place that you can
[1:05:12] stay.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; This is not a place to stay.
[1:05:17] This is a place that we got we passing
[1:05:20] through.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And whatever I can do for Christ in this
[1:05:24] body,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; let me do it. Lord, give me the grace
[1:05:30] and mercy to execute and carry out what
[1:05:34] you've ordained for my life.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; That should be every Christian's
[1:05:38] all glory. That should be every
[1:05:41] Christian tonight. Lord, what can I do
[1:05:43] for this Jesus that's called Christ?
[1:05:46] He's on your hand tonight.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; What can I do for Jesus Christ tonight?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Give me the strength, Lord, and the
[1:05:54] wisdom and the knowledge and the
[1:05:56] submission that I can carry out the will
[1:05:59] of God.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God 56 years old said, "What?
[1:06:04] I haven't done nothing for the Lord
[1:06:05] yet." I said, "Lord have mercy."
[1:06:09] If he could say that at 56, what can we
[1:06:11] say now? Jesus at 33,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; he cast out devils. He healed the sick.
[1:06:18] He raised the dead. He opened not blind
[1:06:22] eyes.
[1:06:24] He preached the acceptable year unto the
[1:06:26] Lord to the people that wouldn't that
[1:06:29] would reject him.
[1:06:32] He blinded his own children eyes in
[1:06:35] Romans 10:11 that you and I might have a
[1:06:38] right to the tree of life.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:06:41] what he thought about us Gentiles.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; The bride, the lamb's wife.
[1:06:49] He thought about you and I in such a way
[1:06:52] that he chose us as his wife.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight if a wife will say,
[1:06:58] "I'm not getting this for you. I'm not
[1:06:59] doing that for you." Get it yourself.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; What kind of wife is that?
[1:07:07] I'm not praying tonight. I'm not
[1:07:09] studying today. I'm not reading the
[1:07:11] Bible today. I'm not doing nothing
[1:07:13] today.
[1:07:15] What do we do Jesus like that?
[1:07:18] What would we do to Jesus?
[1:07:21] I just want to sit down and watch some
[1:07:23] television.
[1:07:25] I just want to play on my phone on my
[1:07:26] iPad tonight.
[1:07:28] Play checkers of
[1:07:32] this little game they be having on the
[1:07:34] phone. Blocks and stuff going together.
[1:07:39] Well, what kind of joy you get? How
[1:07:42] blocks going together and falling apart
[1:07:44] and exploding and going on
[1:07:47] getting 20 30,000 points almost like
[1:07:50] jeopardy.
[1:07:53] The devil want to do anything to steal
[1:07:56] your time
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; away from the Lord.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; He have you watching all kind of stuff.
[1:08:06] Fred Sanford,
[1:08:10] Good Times,
[1:08:13] Family Feud,
[1:08:16] CNN.
[1:08:18] All they doing on CNN is replaying what
[1:08:20] is already happened.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; The president and all of them. It's only
[1:08:26] a repeat of what already is happening.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; We know the King of the North has the
[1:08:32] Bombs with America name on it. We know
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:36] Donald Trump is doing exactly what he's
[1:08:38] supposed to do. He's ordained to do and
[1:08:41] everybody is in radicalness.
[1:08:44] He's doing exactly what God has ordained
[1:08:46] him to do. And you doing exactly what
[1:08:48] God ordained you to do.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; We doing exactly what God ordained us to
[1:08:52] do.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; We praying and getting closer to God cuz
[1:08:55] eternal life is is there.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I give unto you eternal life.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I give unto you eternal life. I told my
[1:09:01] daughter, she said, "Dad, I stayed all
[1:09:03] up all last night, the night before. I
[1:09:05] got a A on this and I got a A on that."
[1:09:07] And I said, "Baby girl, you're doing a
[1:09:09] good job."
[1:09:11] Because anything that's worth getting,
[1:09:13] you got to fight for it.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's why ain't many people getting it.
[1:09:19] You got to fight for it. You got to stay
[1:09:20] up for it. You got to get it. And if you
[1:09:23] want the Holy Ghost, you got to fight
[1:09:25] for it.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Fight your flesh to die out that Jesus
[1:09:28] might be glorified. Amen. True. Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Exodus said the token which is the Holy
[1:09:34] Spirit which the father will send in my
[1:09:36] name. He's going to give you that token.
[1:09:44] That token is easy to get.
[1:09:47] But you got to surrender.
[1:09:50] You won't have to look like the world.
[1:09:52] You don't have to act like the world.
[1:09:53] You don't have to follow the things of
[1:09:55] the world. The token will take you
[1:09:56] there.
[1:09:58] But as long as you got some speck of the
[1:10:02] world wanting to be what? Like the
[1:10:03] world. The Holy Ghost ain't coming. The
[1:10:06] Holy Ghost want to completely deaf. God
[1:10:09] bless you tonight. I know we got
[1:10:10] baptism. Amen. I don't want to be too
[1:10:12] long.
[1:10:14] One last scripture and I'm closing.
[1:10:16] 2 Corinthians 5
[1:10:19] and 14.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] He said, "For the love of Christ
[1:10:27] constrainth us,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; because we thus judge that if one died
[1:10:32] for all, then we are all what?"
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And that he died for all, that they
[1:10:38] which live should not live henceforth
[1:10:40] unto themselves, but unto him which died
[1:10:42] for what?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And rose what?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:10:49] after the flesh. Yay, though we have
[1:10:51] known Christ after the flesh, yet now
[1:10:53] know we henceforth him no
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; more
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; more. Therefore, if any man be in what?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; he is a new creature. Old things are
[1:11:02] passed away. Behold, all things become
[1:11:05] new. And all things are of God, who have
[1:11:08] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ, and has given us the ministry of
[1:11:13] reconciliation.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; To which that God was in Christ,
[1:11:17] reconciled the word to himself, not
[1:11:19] imputing your trespasses unto them, and
[1:11:21] have committed unto us the word of what?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Reconciliation.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Now, reconciliation. Now then are we
[1:11:29] ambassadors
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; for Christ as though God did beseech you
[1:11:35] by us. We pray you in Christstead be ye
[1:11:37] reconciled to God. God bless you
[1:11:40] tonight.
