[33:05] praise god we thank god for you
[33:14] joshua 1 now after the death of moses
[33:18] the servant of the lord it came to pass
[33:22] that the lord speaking to joshua the son
[33:24] of nun
[33:25] moses minister said moses my servant is
[33:28] dead
[33:29] now therefore rise go over this
[33:32] jordan thou and all this people
[33:35] unto the land which i do
[33:38] give them even to the children of
[33:42] israel every place that the soul of
[33:46] your foot shall threat upon that have
[33:50] i given unto you as i
[33:53] said unto moses from the wilderness
[33:57] and from this leviton
[34:00] even
[34:04] even until the great
[34:07] evening to this to leavening
[34:10] the great river the river euphrates
[34:14] all the land of the hittites and
[34:18] unto the great sea towards the going
[34:20] down of the sun
[34:22] shall be your cause there shall not
[34:25] any man be able to stand before thee all
[34:28] the days
[34:29] of thy life as i was with moses
[34:32] so i will be with thee and i will not
[34:36] fail thee not forsake thee and god bless
[34:39] you read this word you may be seated
[34:43] he said i will not fail you and i will
[34:47] not forsake you
[34:49] we thank god that god would do what
[34:52] exactly what he's saying
[34:55] we want to say tonight probably god
[34:58] spoke a message on leadership but we
[34:59] want to talk about follow the leader
[35:03] follow the leader
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] you know that's a difficult time in this
[35:09] hour that we're living in
[35:12] where leaders of every angle
[35:16] of being persecuted in the natural world
[35:20] in the political world and and um
[35:23] just all around leaders the teachers in
[35:26] school
[35:27] they don't get any respect parents don't
[35:30] get any respect
[35:31] leaders are being persecuted this is the
[35:34] age
[35:35] that is a rebellious age it's a age that
[35:39] does not respect headship or leadership
[35:42] so we want to say follow the leader
[35:45] and there are very few followers
[35:49] but we should say follow the leader
[35:53] now joshua is the end time leader and so
[35:58] by the grace of god and joshua is a type
[36:01] of the holy ghost and those that are led
[36:02] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[36:04] of god
[36:06] so by the grace of god we want to just
[36:09] share with you that joshua was to
[36:12] carry the children over into the
[36:14] promised land and
[36:16] and they were to be unstoppable
[36:19] and undefeated
[36:22] only if they would hearing says
[36:26] in the sixth verse it says
[36:29] be strong and of good courage
[36:34] fall unto this people shall thou
[36:37] divide an inheritance of the land
[36:41] which i swear until their fathers to
[36:45] give them
[36:46] it says only
[36:50] be thou strong and very courageous
[36:54] that thou may observe to do
[36:57] according to what all the what
[37:02] see that's a problem
[37:05] that is the problem he said all
[37:09] according to the law see when we
[37:16] joshua had a commandment of the lord
[37:21] and god said as i was with moses i'll be
[37:23] with you
[37:25] but i want you to be a strong and
[37:29] courageous i want you to have all those
[37:31] attributes
[37:34] before joshua could be commissioned
[37:37] to be the successor of moses
[37:42] he had to what
[37:45] follow the word are y'all with me
[37:50] i i i don't mean to preach tonight i
[37:53] just mean to kind of teach and talk to
[37:55] you tonight
[37:56] but joshua had to be a good what
[38:01] a good follower and before god can
[38:05] really
[38:05] you know bring the church into adoption
[38:08] state
[38:09] then they have to be under tutor are you
[38:11] with me
[38:13] and before god can trust you
[38:17] with the true riches with the things
[38:20] that
[38:21] the bride is to do in the end time
[38:24] amen she's to be an invincible army
[38:28] but in order to be an invisible army
[38:32] first of all we got to learn how to be
[38:35] good what
[38:37] good soldiers are you with me
[38:42] see i'm a soldier in the what
[38:46] soldiers are to follow
[38:49] follow the leader follow directions
[38:52] if we cannot follow directions
[38:56] then we're not an invincible army
[39:00] so the devil tactic is to
[39:03] uh cause division take the people
[39:07] have the people disrespect
[39:11] the prophet talked about the message
[39:13] respect
[39:14] disrespect leadership or headship
[39:20] when there's this so on to
[39:23] disregard what the leader has said
[39:28] when they begin to dis
[39:32] regard or not follow direction from the
[39:35] leader
[39:36] things happen things happen to a church
[39:42] things happened to the church when the
[39:45] church
[39:46] did not follow the what leader
[39:51] when the church failed to follow the
[39:52] leader things happened
[39:54] now there was they were successful
[39:58] amen joshua told them in the first
[40:01] battle jericho
[40:02] and all and uh they were
[40:06] just to march around in the city and
[40:09] the walls and they marched around and
[40:12] they kept marching and and y'all know
[40:15] the story how the walls of jericho fell
[40:18] that was a great victory
[40:21] but it came up against another battle
[40:24] later on in the seventh chapter and so
[40:27] forth
[40:28] we talk about the battle of a ai
[40:31] so he sent spies to spy
[40:34] ai and and hey y'all can read it later
[40:38] i i thought i would read it but that's a
[40:41] whole lot of reading and ai was a
[40:43] it was just a few people just a small
[40:47] uh group of people there in ai
[40:51] and um the people had done a
[40:55] successful campaign against jericho and
[40:58] it was marching on
[41:00] but what happened at ai they said
[41:03] when they came back to joshua
[41:07] they told joshua the story of
[41:10] after they've uh looked and spotted out
[41:13] and searched it
[41:15] and um they said in
[41:18] seven and two and joshua sent
[41:21] uh from jericho to ai
[41:24] which is beside
[41:28] beth haven on the east side of bethel
[41:32] and speak unto them saying go up
[41:36] and view the country and
[41:40] the men went up and viewed ai
[41:43] and they returned to joshua and said
[41:45] unto him
[41:47] let not all the people go up
[41:51] but let about two or what
[41:55] three thousand now what happened the man
[41:59] went up
[42:00] now joshua was the end time leader you
[42:02] know he was the one that god had
[42:04] commissioned
[42:05] to lead the people right they come back
[42:09] and they tell him what
[42:11] they're telling joshua what they were
[42:14] doesn't that seem like this age
[42:16] they're going to tell joshua what to do
[42:20] are you with me can't you see the
[42:22] children trying to tell their parents
[42:24] what to do
[42:26] you know what i'm saying they don't mean
[42:29] no harm
[42:30] but they they're trying to uh lead
[42:34] the parents
[42:37] are you with me and sometimes we can get
[42:40] out of position on the job
[42:42] and lose our job because why we begin to
[42:45] tell
[42:46] the boss how to be the boss
[42:51] or the one that's in charge the
[42:53] supervisor
[42:55] we try to tell them how to be the
[42:57] supervisor
[43:00] and see a lot of times when we do that
[43:03] it's trouble on the job and then you
[43:06] have those that
[43:08] uh been around for a little while that
[43:11] they go around
[43:12] and they take this supervisor place
[43:17] you know they they're on the side
[43:19] telling people how to run the job
[43:22] because we've been here a long time we
[43:24] know what we're talking about
[43:27] you see what i'm saying so they tell the
[43:30] super
[43:30] tell the people as donated supervisor
[43:33] supervisor come
[43:34] and say what's going on over here
[43:39] brother frank and i was you know he was
[43:42] telling you know we were having a good
[43:43] you know good conversation and he was
[43:46] telling the
[43:47] uh uh brother simon you know you ought
[43:50] to try this
[43:51] i said yeah brother frank i tried that
[43:54] he said he didn't mean no he said
[43:56] brother seven you ought to try
[43:57] i said you had brother frank i tried
[44:00] that too
[44:01] you something but see a lot of times
[44:05] um when you do all you can do
[44:08] to try to get the church in where it can
[44:11] go forward and go higher in the lord and
[44:14] be successful in in in god sometimes
[44:19] it looks you you might look like a fail
[44:23] amen but one thing about it you got to
[44:25] stay with god's word
[44:27] no matter how bad it may make you
[44:30] look are you with me
[44:34] so it doesn't matter how many assistant
[44:37] pastors you have
[44:40] no matter how long their dress is
[44:44] and how much prophetess they are
[44:49] joshua was commissioned and he's the end
[44:52] time leader
[44:54] are you with me uh the prophet
[44:58] you know you had those those those
[45:01] prophets
[45:02] that was trying to instruct moses how to
[45:06] do his job
[45:08] are you with me it's always that paul
[45:12] had those demons and
[45:15] so forth and he had those people that
[45:18] was trying to
[45:20] you know do a better job than him that's
[45:23] why
[45:23] he said demons has forsaken me and in
[45:25] the end time
[45:26] you know the prophet god had demons
[45:30] okay so we want to go on
[45:34] and um this this seventh chapter of
[45:38] joshua
[45:38] and i'm gonna tell you something the
[45:40] devil don't want you to be on one or
[45:42] what
[45:44] he don't want you to want to call it so
[45:47] we we we're talking about follow the
[45:49] leader the devil will do
[45:51] everything he can do to keep you from
[45:53] being on one accord
[45:56] now you know they were successful at
[45:58] jericho because they were what
[46:00] they won't want a car and they followed
[46:03] the what
[46:04] yeah when joshua said march around they
[46:07] marched around
[46:08] but here they come back to telling
[46:11] joshua how to do it
[46:13] you know and and here's what one writer
[46:17] says
[46:18] the people began to think that it was
[46:20] them
[46:21] doing the job that's why they said we
[46:23] don't we don't need but a few
[46:25] see what i'm saying because they they
[46:27] looked at uh
[46:29] it it's not we don't need all these
[46:31] people to go up against ai
[46:33] just just let us go up you know
[46:36] and that's what happens people think
[46:39] that
[46:40] oh we we we've captured
[46:43] of uh the mighty walls of jericho and
[46:46] fall and
[46:47] we've beat you know we take we've taken
[46:51] over jericho
[46:52] look at this this ain't nothing you know
[46:55] how it is this ain't nothing
[46:57] and it sounds sensible right because
[46:59] they
[47:00] they forgot who gave them the victory
[47:05] we don't need to pray about this have
[47:07] you ever been
[47:08] talking about oh let's do this and never
[47:11] prayed about it never ask
[47:12] god is it all right you just see an
[47:14] opportunity to do
[47:16] it let's do it everybody oh yeah
[47:20] yeah it sounds good to me did
[47:23] no prayer no consulting god and here
[47:26] they are
[47:26] they come back and they see these little
[47:28] bit of people yo
[47:29] oh boy you've had a such a a successful
[47:33] campaign and jericho
[47:35] to amen we don't need all okay so just
[47:38] telling joshua how to do it right
[47:40] and they returned
[47:44] and they said let the third verse let's
[47:47] not
[47:47] all the people go up but let about what
[47:51] two or three thousand
[47:53] you know that's all we need man go up
[47:57] and smite ai and make
[48:00] not all the people do label theater
[48:05] for they are but a few
[48:10] so they went up to the of the people
[48:13] about
[48:14] 3 000 men and they what
[48:20] they got what are y'all with me
[48:24] they really got
[48:28] whip cause
[48:32] 30 some odd men to die
[48:35] all your whooping
[48:38] because there was somebody when they got
[48:42] through searching they found a
[48:43] achin into what cam
[48:47] aiken was there in the camp and aiken
[48:49] had
[48:50] taken a babylonian garment
[48:53] you know somebody can take a mystery
[48:55] babylon garment
[48:58] are you of me
[49:03] they can take that spirit of babylon
[49:07] are you with me and they can get off in
[49:11] the spirit
[49:12] and cause a lot of damage because
[49:16] of lack of respect and that god did not
[49:19] put them in charge he put joshua in
[49:21] charge
[49:23] are you with me so they got they two
[49:26] cent they're gonna put in it
[49:29] instead of being humble and obedient
[49:32] they want to put their two cents on it
[49:34] and do their own thing their own way
[49:38] are you with me but i said
[49:41] joshua is the end time leader the bible
[49:45] said they that are led by
[49:46] what how do you know when you're led by
[49:50] the spirit of god
[49:51] and that's the trouble the
[49:54] the trouble is it's so many that can say
[49:58] well i'm led by the spirit to do this
[50:01] and i'm led
[50:02] by the spirit to do that what spirit
[50:08] what spirit is it
[50:11] see we got to know what spirit we're
[50:14] talking about because god is not the
[50:17] author of what
[50:19] if confusion isn't that right and god
[50:23] will not
[50:24] lead you against his what
[50:29] words if god lead
[50:33] if i tell you something that's different
[50:35] from what the words say
[50:37] and we got amen
[50:41] we got a dust said the lord and god has
[50:44] sent
[50:44] money god for in this hour are you with
[50:48] me
[50:49] and we cannot respect what he's saying
[50:54] i don't think people respect what i say
[50:58] if they don't respect what he said with
[51:00] all the vindication
[51:02] are you with me so by the grace of god
[51:06] i i i i don't know
[51:10] i was praying because i i really didn't
[51:12] know
[51:14] i think it was brother ernie's turn
[51:15] tonight but i said lord let me be ready
[51:18] you know because i i don't think brother
[51:21] ernie's going to be this is anniversary
[51:23] time i don't think he's going to be here
[51:24] tonight
[51:25] so let me go ahead on be ready okay
[51:28] so i just prayed god give me something
[51:30] i'll tell you what i wanted to talk on
[51:33] i wanted to talk on the love of god
[51:39] and i i just saw the you know just just
[51:43] you know how much he loved us and you
[51:44] know i i've been talking about that a
[51:46] lot
[51:49] and um what would you give up for god
[51:54] what would you what would you really
[51:55] give up for for god
[51:58] seeing that he gave everything he had up
[52:01] for you
[52:02] do you love him enough to give up
[52:06] everything you got for him
[52:09] he he left everything he had heaven and
[52:12] angels and worshipping i mean he came
[52:16] down
[52:18] in the likeness of sin for flesh
[52:21] gave up everything i know moses gave up
[52:25] a lot right
[52:27] but christ gave up a lot for you
[52:30] are you worth it is your life worthy of
[52:33] the gospel
[52:35] do you think you've given up enough for
[52:38] christ's sake
[52:41] are you with me see because sometimes we
[52:44] think
[52:45] whatever we've done we did it for the
[52:47] church we did it for the pastor
[52:49] we did it for one another we have no
[52:53] idea that you haven't done nothing yet
[52:57] when it compares to christ and what he
[53:00] gave up for you
[53:02] and you can never replace the love of
[53:05] god
[53:06] amen if you understand if you understood
[53:10] or understand
[53:11] how much he loves you and what he gave
[53:14] up for you
[53:16] for you to be a son or daughter of god
[53:19] then you would give him the uttermost
[53:21] respect okay
[53:25] i talked about soldiers falling
[53:27] direction
[53:29] i talked about sheep needing a shepherd
[53:32] i was teaching a group of people and
[53:36] they were people that were more
[53:39] outstanding and more intelligent
[53:41] and they were different races and
[53:43] different backgrounds and
[53:46] i was in this huge church in the big
[53:48] corner in
[53:50] charlotte north carolina and this
[53:54] humongous church and
[53:58] my nephew calvin got me opportunities to
[54:00] go there
[54:01] and teach this group of people
[54:04] and the name of the group was called the
[54:06] body
[54:09] the body and in the body
[54:13] that's a whole it's all over the nation
[54:15] and all over the world probably
[54:17] the body and this is what they believe
[54:22] that the church let's go to colossians
[54:26] i'm skipping over a lot of stuff because
[54:29] i'm trying to get to the point i'm
[54:30] trying to close
[54:31] i'm trying to close
[54:35] okay colossians 1.
[54:41] there's so much i could go through but
[54:45] a a a good leader has to
[54:48] be a good follower first jesus had them
[54:50] he said come and follow
[54:52] me what if they didn't follow jesus they
[54:55] just stayed away the world
[54:57] and what what if they followed him but
[54:59] so far
[55:01] you know because 70 of them turn around
[55:03] when he said except you eat my flesh and
[55:05] drank my blood
[55:06] now they weren't good followers and
[55:09] there was only 12
[55:10] left and one of them was a devil
[55:13] he got to a point that he was going to
[55:15] sell jesus out didn't that write his
[55:16] brother dwayne was talking about selling
[55:18] out jesus
[55:19] he sold jesus out isn't that right so he
[55:22] said i'm not showing you 12 and you know
[55:24] one of y'all ain't with me
[55:26] you know what i'm saying you know i i
[55:29] know
[55:30] in shepherding and pastoring you
[55:33] wouldn't want
[55:33] everybody to be with you but you know
[55:35] only those that love you will be with
[55:37] you
[55:39] amen if they love you they'll they'll be
[55:42] with you in thick and insane
[55:44] amen they'll show their love and their
[55:47] action
[55:48] and uh and they'll do anything they can
[55:51] do for you
[55:52] i know i had pastors and time passed
[55:56] and you know i used to think
[55:59] you know i appreciate the pastor so much
[56:01] because you know he preached the gospel
[56:03] to me
[56:04] and i thought that my life was totally
[56:07] changed
[56:08] i was getting my pink cadillac and i was
[56:11] gonna be like
[56:11] charleston blue oh boy i was got my pink
[56:15] out of rod i got my money i'm ready to
[56:18] go
[56:19] and i got saved and when i got saved
[56:24] i would do anything you know the pastor
[56:27] asked me to do i was willing
[56:31] because i was just so appreciative i'm
[56:33] saved now
[56:35] look where i was going down that dark
[56:38] road
[56:39] didn't even know i was going down there
[56:43] just 18
[56:46] 19 years old you know
[56:49] all set up look went to the movie one
[56:53] time
[56:54] and i saw charleston blue and i'm gonna
[56:57] get me a paint cadillac
[57:00] el dorado you see what i'm saying
[57:04] so by the grace of god god can change
[57:07] everything
[57:09] you know i used to think you know i had
[57:12] so much
[57:13] i love my pastor so much he said
[57:17] he said i need to come i said
[57:20] you need a car i had
[57:23] my paint cadillac money i said go buy
[57:25] you one he would have bought him a brand
[57:27] new one
[57:29] you know i gave him
[57:33] what i was gonna get because i wanted
[57:36] him to have
[57:39] and when he said y'all understand
[57:42] because when you love somebody you give
[57:46] it it doesn't matter you and then i was
[57:49] thinking sometimes
[57:50] if somebody came in and they want to do
[57:52] something to my pastor
[57:54] i jump in the front i'd rather die
[57:57] first you know what i'm saying you know
[58:00] when you really care about somebody
[58:02] you you give your life it doesn't matter
[58:06] you know that's the way i said god when
[58:08] i stop feeling that way about the people
[58:10] if somebody come in here to try to harm
[58:12] y'all i want to be the first one
[58:14] to get in the front and get my life
[58:17] first
[58:18] see what i'm saying but when i lose that
[58:22] when i don't no longer want to do that
[58:24] then i don't need to be a pastor anymore
[58:28] are you with me i'm talking about for
[58:31] the least one
[58:33] i'm not talking about the one that you
[58:35] know
[58:37] that you know would give me the last
[58:40] time i'm talking about the one that
[58:41] wouldn't give me a penny
[58:45] you see what i'm saying but i got to be
[58:48] if i don't have that in me
[58:51] if i'm just going to love those that you
[58:54] know love me
[58:55] then what reward have we you got to love
[58:59] everybody regardless of what they'd
[59:04] say or do jesus gave his life while we
[59:07] were yet
[59:08] sinners for the ungodly
[59:13] he gave himself for us are you
[59:16] so it is not about the you know
[59:20] it is it's about understanding and
[59:23] and knowing what he did for you
[59:26] and if you're not willing to lay down
[59:28] your life for one another
[59:30] are you with me you got to be willing to
[59:33] lay down your life for one another
[59:36] brother go back to the body
[59:40] yo i got to close
[59:43] but the body colossians 1 and 14.
[59:51] it's it's good to be in the house of the
[59:53] lord and
[59:54] because uh i tell you where would i be
[59:57] in some
[59:58] i'd probably be dead in some night club
[1:00:01] oh i know i
[1:00:02] didn't like those but you know that's
[1:00:04] what the devil would have
[1:00:06] ultimately done you had no place to go
[1:00:09] but in the the devil's church the
[1:00:12] nightclub and
[1:00:13] stuff like that and you know you
[1:00:17] could have been a drug on drugs and
[1:00:19] doing all kind of stuff
[1:00:20] but god mercy savior when you young boy
[1:00:25] with a foolish mind and a foolish heart
[1:00:27] but god come by and save you
[1:00:30] come by have mercy on your soul you save
[1:00:33] you from a lot of headaches and trouble
[1:00:36] mess another folk life up messing your
[1:00:38] own life up
[1:00:39] with god's savior and you know when god
[1:00:43] saved you
[1:00:44] like that and you know where you was
[1:00:45] headed you do everything
[1:00:47] you can do that's what i understand
[1:00:49] about folk
[1:00:52] they don't do everything they can do to
[1:00:53] try to keep somebody from going the way
[1:00:55] you were going
[1:00:57] if you recognize the road you was going
[1:00:59] down
[1:01:00] then you he said after the holy ghost
[1:01:04] come upon you you should have
[1:01:05] power and you should be witnesses to me
[1:01:07] you'll tell somebody about the love
[1:01:10] that they can experience this love and
[1:01:12] how this love affected your whole life
[1:01:15] how it changed you made you a new
[1:01:17] creature
[1:01:18] made you not want to do those things you
[1:01:21] don't want
[1:01:21] you don't want to do that you don't want
[1:01:23] to be a fornicator adultery
[1:01:25] you don't want to be i mean you don't
[1:01:27] want oh lord
[1:01:29] you want to be a child of god you love
[1:01:31] him because you appreciate what he's
[1:01:33] done for you
[1:01:35] oh god i was blind but nah i see
[1:01:41] now colossians 1 and 14
[1:01:45] it says in whom we have redemption to
[1:01:47] his blood
[1:01:48] even the forgiveness of sin who is the
[1:01:51] image
[1:01:52] of the invisible god the firstborn of
[1:01:55] every creature
[1:01:56] for by him were all things created that
[1:01:59] are
[1:01:59] in heaven and that are in earth visible
[1:02:02] and in
[1:02:04] visible and invisible whether there be
[1:02:07] thrones or
[1:02:08] dominion or principalities or powers
[1:02:11] all things were created by him
[1:02:14] and he is before all things and by him
[1:02:18] all things consist
[1:02:20] and he is the what
[1:02:23] you know the little group of people they
[1:02:27] were called the body
[1:02:28] they were i think they were very
[1:02:30] intelligent people
[1:02:32] the body and
[1:02:35] um i thank god that they gave me
[1:02:39] somebody simple like me they gave me
[1:02:42] respect and they let me come in and
[1:02:46] teach them and witness to them and
[1:02:50] and i appreciate the humility they even
[1:02:52] came down to
[1:02:53] the tent revival and with us and so
[1:02:56] forth
[1:02:58] and but i i appreciate that
[1:03:01] but one i i i felt like it was time for
[1:03:04] me
[1:03:05] to zero in i've
[1:03:08] been your friend a little while and i
[1:03:11] was touching here and now but now it's
[1:03:13] time to zero in
[1:03:16] on the body see one thing about it they
[1:03:20] were so
[1:03:21] interested in the body and in the body
[1:03:25] they just let the supposed to let the
[1:03:27] spirit be led
[1:03:28] and we all sat around and whoever want
[1:03:31] to say something
[1:03:32] uh you know can take the flow and say
[1:03:34] what they got to say you know
[1:03:36] the body so i got my opportunity
[1:03:43] i didn't sit around here long enough and
[1:03:46] i was
[1:03:46] y'all listening to me pretty good and
[1:03:49] receiving pretty good
[1:03:52] but i said today is the day
[1:03:56] i said the body got to have a head
[1:04:04] and i thought then if you were sheep
[1:04:10] then where is the shepherd it's because
[1:04:13] they didn't believe in no pastors
[1:04:17] they just believe in being layered by
[1:04:19] the word
[1:04:20] everybody's spirit you know and
[1:04:24] so nobody no pastors nowhere you go
[1:04:28] it's just the body but he said
[1:04:33] here it says and he is the head
[1:04:36] of the body so they say he's the head
[1:04:38] god is the head of the body
[1:04:42] and said the church who is the beginning
[1:04:45] and the firstborn from the dead that he
[1:04:49] might have the preeminence
[1:04:51] so they said it's just the holy ghost
[1:04:54] don't need no head
[1:04:55] don't need those i says
[1:04:59] i thought she needed the shepherd
[1:05:04] they said and one of the sisters
[1:05:07] ella and his sister she looked at me and
[1:05:10] she said huh
[1:05:11] i never heard that before you know
[1:05:15] i said it's all right
[1:05:18] if you're not a sheep you don't need a
[1:05:21] shepherd
[1:05:23] but if you're a sheep i i believe you
[1:05:25] need a shepherd
[1:05:27] but if you're it's all right if you go
[1:05:29] you don't need no shepherd
[1:05:32] but a sheep needs a shepherd are you
[1:05:35] with me
[1:05:37] and the sheep don't lead themselves the
[1:05:39] shepherd leaves the sheep
[1:05:42] are you with me so when i said those
[1:05:46] things
[1:05:48] there was almost a yearning and a crime
[1:05:53] because i saw that it took over
[1:05:57] the little congregation
[1:06:01] but i had a few brothers on the side
[1:06:03] that's very intellectual
[1:06:05] oh no oh no i said give me bible
[1:06:09] what you gonna say now
[1:06:14] they didn't have no bible no bible
[1:06:17] nobody could dispute
[1:06:19] but they just had never heard nobody
[1:06:21] come in there
[1:06:22] and just directed them if you're gonna
[1:06:26] be sheep you need a shepherd
[1:06:28] and i said it's time now that you need a
[1:06:30] shepherd
[1:06:32] you need somebody he when he said he led
[1:06:35] captivity captain gave gibson to men he
[1:06:37] gave some apostles some prophet
[1:06:40] some pastors some teachers for the what
[1:06:46] work in the ministry for the edified in
[1:06:47] the body
[1:06:49] amen until we all come into the statute
[1:06:51] of what
[1:06:54] and see what i'm saying to disrespect
[1:06:57] the the bible let's go to ephesians 5
[1:07:00] and i'm closing on this scripture
[1:07:02] ephesians 5 but to disrespect
[1:07:07] to be led by the spirit and disrespect
[1:07:10] the word
[1:07:11] i believe we're not led by god's spirit
[1:07:14] we're really laid by another spirit
[1:07:18] because we cannot disrespect the word
[1:07:20] it's just like
[1:07:22] the brother says you can't receive the
[1:07:25] holy ghost
[1:07:27] lessen you in you know
[1:07:30] the message or whatever and i said well
[1:07:33] you know are they distinguishing
[1:07:37] the message different from the bible i
[1:07:42] said
[1:07:42] what i'm getting is it's the message
[1:07:46] and the bible is over here somewhere and
[1:07:49] it's the message over here somewhere
[1:07:51] but if the bible is the one that said
[1:07:54] jesus gives the holy ghost then i can't
[1:07:58] see you separating the message
[1:08:02] from the bible and the bible said if a
[1:08:04] man repent
[1:08:06] and repent and be baptized in the name
[1:08:08] of jesus christ
[1:08:10] he shall receive what
[1:08:13] am i right so what if a person did that
[1:08:16] is that the message
[1:08:18] it should be because what was the
[1:08:21] purpose of the message
[1:08:22] is to take us back to what
[1:08:25] the faith of the apostolic fathers is
[1:08:27] that one of
[1:08:28] the man that had the keys said this how
[1:08:30] you get it
[1:08:33] and this one the prophet said you said
[1:08:35] lord if you don't have the holy ghost he
[1:08:37] said
