upon those who own a special prayer request as lord we ask you god lord to have your will in your way in this service we pray for our pastor lord that you'll continue to keep him strengthen him god give him your your direction god for the people lord we ask you god to look upon god in service tonight circumcise my lips lord move me out of the way bless the word oh god as we looking unto you tonight god bless in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles the book of philippians philippians 2. i want to start from the 12th verse to the 15th wherefore my brethren wherefore my beloved have ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmuring and disputing that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labor in vain let us pray father we thank you god for the reading of your word god we pray that you just bless it in jesus name amen amen i i want to just use for a thought tonight work out your own salvation work out your own salvation and i want to if you don't mind i want to just read a little uh footnote in my bible that seemed to correspond to what i want to try to bring and i'm not mean to belong tonight but just a little thought that's where you can kind of see where i am heading and what i was really looking at and it says here now my thought remember coming from the uh 12th verse working out your own salvation and every one of us each one of us individually has to understand what am i doing and how am i going by to do it i would listen to something the servant of god was saying the other day he said it's the way we present it to the people the way we present the gospel to the people and how they receive it but it's basically our presentation how do you present it to him so tonight we want to look at working out your own salvation but you know and i know that it's not that you work to get salvation because salvation is already a finished work but i now am understanding that uh when you present it to the people then it's taking uh in a certain way that sometimes they don't really catch the essence of even just working out your own salvation now salvation is deliverance from the power and effect of sin that what salvation is really all about deliverance from the power and the effect of sin let me just read this here so i can get it out of the way the way i want it said god has already wrought salvation in them talk about the philippians carrying it to its logical conclusion god has granted us of them salvation not just for their own prophet but for the good of others as well if they work out and manifest i like that the new life divinely worked in them see they will live lives worthy of the gospel [Music] in harmony with each other seeking the progress of the gospel they will also regard one another as more important than their own self so in working out your salvation if it's presented right if it's taken by faith because the only way that you really are going to benefit is that it has to be uh taken by faith no church can give you salvation no preacher no a certain denomination or anything but it only comes through what jesus christ has already done a finished work and the bible state now there's south there's no other salvation given among men whereby we ought to be saved in through the name of jesus christ so no other name no other title no creed no doubt only through what jesus christ has already done for you and now and when it's believed by faith you must first believe it the bible says one place without faith it is impossible so it must be by faith that you're working out whatever jesus christ has done for you at calvary it belongs to you [Music] you become the bitter fishery [Music] of what jesus has done by your faith not the church faith or you know any preacher's faith but you alone and to believe that to to believe what he did and carry and give you an assurance it changes the way you conduct yourself [Music] you don't live yourself your life for yours but you're living it for others jesus whole life he came to live it for us for the whole world i want to say he was god's requirement for what mankind needed to be done everything that god wanted to do he did it through jesus christ through the life that he lived i want to stress that soul matter because only through the life that we live that reflects god amen and when their life is lived correctly it is manifesting god life through you and i jesus said if i be lifted up how is he going to be lift up if we are not living the correct life the god purpose was to manifest himself through jesus christ now through you and i am amen so you become the very manifestation of god again amen guarding flesh manifesting himself again in your own neighborhood on your job wherever you go your life is expressing god to this generation right here through all the corruption through all the ridicules and the criticism yet god has a people that will manifest him then we declare to the world that jesus of the bible is jesus right now but only through the life is is live correctly that's why it's so important for us to get the holy ghost you may be going to church and you may be doing all the good acts that christian does but if that life amen is not being manifested and people know they knew that when those people in the book of acts have got a hold of something they wasn't the same people amen amen they saw jesus again yet he died but he rose not only he rise again but he sent back the same not another jesus not another life but it was the same manifestation of god again that peter that was a coward and used to curse and did this and that now peter stood boldly begin to tell those people you men of israel and this same jesus see and the bible declared that 13 and 8 hebrews jesus christ is when if he is the same where is he where is he at that's what the world wants to see amen amen we talk about him and we can quote things and and we can talk about things but can we actually bring god down amen because i heard the testimony that's what the people need we've had churches we've signed on the name of the book yet we still aren't saved this salvation that i'm talking about it's not a weak salvation but it is the power of god living in us to bring forth the very manifestation of god for this generation that's why we declare that we're not just talking about a historical events that what god used to do and how how he used peter and mary and a different one now god want to use you and i servant of god says some people the only jesus they'll see is through you and not for your talking i'm not talking about your talk but they're watching you they're watching you they hear you talking but they say now where's the goods y'all talk that y'all have a reveal word and god is doing the same thing but let's see it now i'm not talking about a show because you and i understand that this world is spiritually sick the church world is spiritually sick amen they can't produce the manifestation of god so they give the people traditions and entertainment amen but that won't satisfy a true seed of god they will god amen go ahead amen and i'll declare you there's only one way you're going to get it and it's not by singing you don't come by shouting and preaching those things it comes when we can get down on our knees and cry out that's what the early church did they came together to pray and when they did it shook the whole city they were turning the city upside down because they understood that the only way we're going to manifest god we got to get in contact with him how do we get in contact with god how do we see the very word of god through us how can i live such a life and i don't have the person then you got to go back sometime i heard the servant of god say what we need in this hour he said we need to get back to that all night prayer meeting but we the left our sermons become more important than prayer meetings we are so uh you're concerned we ought to be somewhat but the servant of god said there's nothing more powerful than prayer life what bring this salvation i'm talking about i won't go to another scripture second peter second peter one 5-10 besides this giving our diligence add to your faith virtue into virtual knowledge into knowledge temperance and to tempers patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound mean they stay there they make you that ye neither shall be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that locket these things is blind and cannot see a falloff and forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather brethren give our dealers to make your calling and your election sure but if you do these things you should never fall see making your calling working out your salvation i tell people all the time there we have no time to look around and to be wondering what i ought to do we've got to understand lord let me examine myself it's good to be concerned about others but that come to terms you got to get a checkup lord check me out examine me lord search my heart do i have the goods do i have oil i think no this is the hour you got to be certain of god and when you suck your life and you see unlikely it's time to get to the altar amen but why are we waiting on somebody to tell us remember you responsible for your own soul nobody else can feed that but you so the god said your soul is worth more than 10 000 worlds but how do you treat it what are you feeding it is it the right food we feed the natural body but our spiritual body says i'm hungry i'm thirsting for god they say i want to see the power of god in a sanctuary again amen but more so than that i want to see him in my tabernacle too many times and you hear people all the time and say that they'd like to tell you oh how god is in our church but i wonder is it is he in us because if he's there you'll be fruitful but if he's not there you'll be barren see every tree gonna bring forth of the kind that it is if it's the right seed in the right ground it got to produce the right fruit and in good form of you planting corn you don't want to say cabbage you expect to see corn and when god planned to see the word and he expect to see the very manifestation of what the word came to do if there's ever has been a season in a time that we need to work out our own lord let me examine where i'm at you know i think you take inventory of things you know i you know and i just had a birthday last month and i said lord here i am now 59. when i first came to mueller i was 27 years old and i said lord help me not to just sit around and complain and look at other but lord help me to look at myself because it's nobody's fault it's nobody fought by mine if i don't get a hold of god a lot of times we always seem people always have a complaint that is always the pastor he is the one why i ain't growing no the son of god said nobody can stop you but you because even one person died for you one person that gave you your salvation and that's jesus christ every one of us see now is trying to work out our own salvation and saying lord what do i need to do what do i need to do lord but you got to be willing and honestly lord here i am help me help me to get out of the lazy zone lord stir up stir up in me lord yeah lord i know there's people that need help but lord i can't help nobody until i get some help a lot of times people try to help others and they need help themselves see first you get help i get help and then when we get help then we have something to give out you remember that man was that that temple the beautiful and peter we used to go out in that an hour to prayer he just now been there but he been there all the time but that day something happened to peter them that man was sitting there begging for all that peter them something must have struck them inspiration struck pity them and people say look on us but you notice where they were going prayer service you see what prayer is able to do somebody might come through our doors desperate broken in bondage that's why the prayer or the righteous or there is much if we are that church that god is looking for are we gonna just be like everybody else tell them people man i said let me tell you i said i just didn't come just to put a name on a piece or a bulletin board no no no that's not what what i even came for but i come for one thing one purpose the lord there are souls there's a lost soul somewhere in the city but the burden for lost souls done left us all we care about is us you know what that song says all about us no you all be willing to make a sacrifice and to do something for somebody else to be able to lay yourself aside and say look you know god wouldn't save you i know god that can deliver you let your testimony be a living reality your very life that you live before them more than anything it's not the good sermon that we preach but it's the life that we live before them when everybody now is saying dear christian what's the difference between you and them see that life gives off a certain radius if it's a real life i believe in one place in the bible it said peter those shadow healed the people they were so under the inspiration the note of god just their presence healed folks without saying anything i laid in a hand it was just their presence because it was jesus that life didn't live it wasn't theirs in the life that you and i live in tonight it ought not just to be for you but to be lord help me to be a light wherever i go me to be that example help me to be that one lord that i'm willing to fast or pray or whatever it takes god to get in my uh little secret closet somewhere and call on you lord servant god said what happened a lot of time is said we don't stay long enough for god to do it when we feel a thrill or we feel a chill but no no god wants you to stay right there until something happened and when it happened in you you don't have to tell nobody in a show it'll show that something about you that differently you know uh what's up tell me to say that you know that they went to work and um and uh this one young girl wanted somebody to pray for him and and um they greeted us how about me i'm a christian dude she said girl you got some issues but they saw something in somebody that seemed real and that's why your very conversations that that you talking right across that little cubicle wherever you at people are listening they watch you come in and they might not even say much to you at all but they'll watch it and when they really need prayer to go up guess who they come and do they say on my job i know this sister you know that she ain't like everybody else that called they called themself chris but she really lives what she's talking about and that's what we want to do we want to live what we're talking about let our life speak for us and god will testify who you are tonight work out your own salvation with fear and we're trembling god bless you praise god we appreciate appreciate the word tonight amen work out your own salvation our salvation is near and we're when we first believe we thank god that we it's at the funeral today and listen to the jib witness fella and you know and i was so glad that brother perry got up and said a little something after the dismissal of the service so and um i you know you can't work your way to heaven it's not about works at least any man should boast it's the gift of god the salvation that god has given us is precious what god has given you and i is precious and i'm saying it's so good to know better it's so good that your eyes of your understanding has been enlightened that you can see and see what the devil is out there he's blinding folks from the truth but by the grace of god the truth that god has given us we ought to cherish it and thank him every day that god is opening our eyes because people are hurt not now people think they're right and think they're doing the right thing working hard to try to get to heaven not knowing that price has already been paid praise god our work is not us working it's him that worketh in us amen both do we all and they do his good pleasure it's what god is doing in us that's why we're working on our own salvation why because we got somebody that working in us praise god it's the spirit of god working through you that's what you're working out your own salvation the holy ghost seeing you doing the work jesus said
