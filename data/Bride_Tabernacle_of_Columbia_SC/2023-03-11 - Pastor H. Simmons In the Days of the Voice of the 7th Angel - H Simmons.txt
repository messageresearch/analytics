Afflicted thank you for touching sister and oh God and may you continue to touch her Lord and continue to bless her Lord and father the different ones oh God on the prayer list Lord I pray that you continue to move in their lives father God I just prayed tonight that something would be said something would be done oh God that you oh God will get glory god and Lord may you open our understanding that we might understand the scriptures in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you amen Revelation 10 the full first we start there first verse and I saw a mighty angel coming out from Heaven clothed in a cloud and rainbows upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and feet is pillow to fire going out to the fourth verse and when he and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voice voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven Sent unto me sealed up those things with the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the heavens and the things that a day in are and the Earth the things that are therein are and to see the things that are there which are they in that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he has declared unto his servant the prophet God Mysteries towards will be receiving I was sharing brother Palmer the other day and I was sharing some things down to Mullins last night and uh brother Ernest was to speak with Jeremiah brother and his thank the Lord for brother Ernest amen I said let me just share these things while it's on my heart he said no I got I said let me just do this tonight appreciate you brother Ernest thank you um in the days of the voice of the seven angel now something is supposed to happen but it's he says in the days not just um one day but in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels when he should begin the sound not collectively a group but he shall begin the sound he so he didn't say them or a day but he said he Singler when he should begin to sound the mysteries of God shall be finished and now we understand that the seven angel sometimes people when they see an angel they'll immediately think about the Heavenly angels and um Peter was in jail and they thought and Peter had them the angel had come and opened the doors of the jail they thought they saw his angel and they said it is his name just not really Peter it's his angel and then when the Book of Revelation when there was fell at defeat the worship the one that was showing them the things he said see that I do it not so I'm your fellow servant of your brother and the prophet see the angel that was showing them the things that was written in the book are you with me so we can go through those scriptures but I'm not going to take a whole lot of time but hopefully you understand that he says that I'm not a Heavenly angel I'm an Earthly messenger so that word angel means Messengers and in the seven Church ages there were seven ages periods of time that God they said the seven spirits of God we know God is this one Lord one faith amen and that's just one God are you with me and we don't look at God having seven spirits but that seven full way of God is going to work this one spirit is going to work in a seven-fold manner are y'all with me so as God sent out his spirit at each age and it was to come back from God's spirit was to come back the working of Satan in each age that God messenger comes on this scene and the enemy he's coming but God always has a message to withstand the enemy in each age so God sends her a messenger with a message to come back in every age and Paul in his time he knew and John and the apostles knew in their time that the spirit of antichrist was in the world and they had to fight against the Antichrist spirit and they knew that this day was going to come when things are going to get so terrible that Jesus said that it would be like Sodom and it'd be like the days of Noah so brothers and sisters I think we're looking for Revival but we're looking for somebody and me and brother Fred was talking we're looking for somebody else to bring the Revival the Revival may just come to you as an individual just you as an individual and you might be looking for somebody a old a big group of people to bring Revival but you must have your own fire and you must bring your own Revival when the acts where is the wealth to Revival the officer said you're looking at it and you said where's the bride Revival you got to say you're looking at the bright Revival but you can't say it if you don't feel and if it hadn't been revealed to you and you're not really expressing what the Revival is all about as long as you're looking for something you'll never be that are you with me but when you possess it then you don't have to look for the future to it to come but you must be possesses that's why Jesus didn't you know he knew who he was and he said uh our friend louder this is is sleeping and I go awaken and they said Lord if he sleep he'd do as well he said no no no no no letters is dead and I'm going to wake him up are you with me so when he got there they and he said she said I see my brother again at the resurrection at the last day and and they but she failed to recognize that I'm not looking for the resurrection at the last day Jesus said I am the resurrection so he was talking present tense while they were talking about future tense are you with me so he realized that I don't have to look to the future I am the resurrection so once you know who you are the bride would one day recognize who she is and then the Rapture would take place but you got to recognize that the power to raise Jesus up from the dead that same power should dwell in you and should Quicken your mortal body are you with me but if you don't feel a power and sometimes uh we're distracted by so many things mindful Temptations and things that will trouble us amen but it's in the midst of all your troubles you must know who you are and you must know no matter what greater is he that's in you amen and if God has allowed it then it's for a purpose praise God and I thank God that I have victory over it I'm not going to say that uh this thing is going to control my destiny praise God I said the blood has not lost his power amen God it's just as real as he ever was amen though he allows us to go through tests and trials God is still God he's not weak amen he's just as strong as he was yesterday today and he'll be that way forever praise God so we he has not diminished his power amen this power is still real praise God and his power was so much it's still real in you no matter if Jesus went to the cross and they spit on him Jesus wasn't weak he had the power to call 12 but he understood that this trial was just for the present distress I had to go through this trial amen because cup I gotta drink it praise God because I have a purpose in drinking this cup it's not because I'm so weak that I can't defeat this devil but I have a time and it's written in the book I come to do your Will O Lord and I gotta fulfill scripture and sometimes amen God allows things to happen amen that you might know how to be conduct your lives to keep you in your right place let you be humble amen amen to ensure that you need him I need you Lord I need you praise God I'm Reliant I'm not trusting in my ability I'm not trusting in my strength but I'm trusting in the Lord amen my God is more than evil praise God somebody said if he didn't deliver me out of this fire then I know he's able to praise God I'm not going to bow down and I'm not going to doubt his healing power I know he's a Healer though he's slavery yet I trust him oh I know what God amen his power is not we so I still claim the victory I still claim amen with the stripes I'm Healed no matter what I go through brother and sister that's the way it got to be no I don't know why God didn't that for a little bit but God is good amen now the day that we're living in sometimes we wonder what is the message you heard the word message message and sometimes people are scar they're kind of I don't know what you talking about determin knowledge your message Maybe if we look at Monte car 3 some people don't understand message they talk about I'm in the message now the terminologies and we have a lingo that we speak and everybody speaks certain languages and it looks like it's spoken in people or astonished because uh you know each Church you were a Church of God in Christ you have a certain language Church of Christ has a certain lingo uh uh the Baptists have a certain angle everybody again certain Apostolic if it was PAW it was a refuge uh and they different a little amen they've got a little terminology different a little scripture differences amen but you must know in the midst of all these different thoughts and ideologies and separation the Pharisee had a difference from the side of seeds you see are you with me see because the Pharisees believed in the resurrection and they believed in angels but the Sadducees they didn't believe in the resurrection and angels and so forth are you with me so there was a difference in Jesus days and terminology the heurians and so forth people had their own ideas but God sent a messenger in the midst of all these different we were somewhat call them denominational thoughts and ideals and people were you know following certain sex the Roadies the rhodiums and it was different types of pasta lights and you know all different types of it's some it wasn't as bad as it is today you know because we got the house it looked like thousands of I mean it looked like another one creep up every day another ideology you know what I'm saying so by the grace of God but in the midst of this chaos and diffusion of religion then there must be a truth if there's got to be a if there's a false then there has to be a real you cannot have a counterfeit dollar lesson you got a real one amen and you can't have a false prophet listen you got a true prophet are you with me praise God you have to have truth before you have error are you with me so by the grace of God in the midst of all of this terminology don't get caught up on terminology and make that terminology your salvation are you with me I don't get caught up on fire seeds salucida or or whatever these different thoughts because you can identify with a group and all the different groups are saying that they believe the same one which is Jesus Christ every one of them almost if they say they're Christians but you get caught up and identify with the gesture group now and what's wrong with being identified with the group it may not be nothing wrong it's just your understanding your revelation are you with me it was some people that came before The Prophet when you had the prayer line and they were different religions different denominations he said I see that that light he said you're a Christian today if uh folks are saying that if you're not with us you're not a Christian now that's hard because we are able to determine that this person is not a Christian then it would be different from what the prophet said I mean you know when he was here and he said hey you go to this church and oh no it wasn't about the churches whether or not the person identified as a Christian he talks about the blood tag was it the blood been applied let me see your blood tag are you with me so a lot of times we disassociate Folk because we said they're not in the message are you with me in other words you're not a Pharisee um you're in trouble you're not a sad you see you're in trouble brother and sister let's not get that you're not with a polos you're not with cephas you're not with Paul okay so the Believers had confrontations and the days of the Apostles I'm a Paul I'm a cephas I'm of Apollos I'm a Paul Paul says we don't want that kind of going on in the message of the hour this is the message that comes it's only one one planted the other waters but who gives the increase he said God gives the increase are you with me so it was God that gave the increase brother and sister your church your ideology the way you think about it no matter how smart intelligent how revelated you are your Revelation is for you your Revelation does not say me it's for you amen see after when it comes down to Salvation the church does not save you the group that you identify with to don't save you you have only one savior and that's Jesus Christ because you believe a certain persuasion does not automatically gives you the Holy Ghost because you believe that God sent a prophet and you believe that the message is right no no no no just because you say I believe that Jesus Christ gives you the Holy Ghost amen to whomever he will no matter what your preachers say what your pastor say what you think Jesus Christ has control of that brother Simmons don't tell him who who to save and I don't tell him who to heal I don't tell him you know it's almost like healing is the children bread isn't that right well what if God heals somebody that's not then you tell him what to do he said well God didn't heal him and they said I thank you Lord thank you Jesus are you with me what you got no business leave him alone that's God that's God's business God he we don't control what God does I know some people feel like they control what God does but they don't control how God worried amen sometimes we don't understand he's let's just look at it a little bit mardokai 3. behold I send my messenger and he shall what prepare the way before me amen the purpose of the message of the owl in the messenger words to prepare the way he was not the way he was preparing the way are you with me he didn't want you to look up to him for John said he that has the bride is the what is the bride groomed are you with me so it's not so much and so John was interested in y'all looking to him he said I must decrease but he must increase I wonder do you have your increase yet do you have the increase if you have the increase then as it was as eloism went to get a bride for Eisen when she got to Isaac she wasn't no she didn't want to hey Elise what you think about it oh I'm with Isaac now it's Isaac matters thank god you bought me two amen John everybody that left you and they're going to Jesus church now what you think they following him your disciple John said you know how you worried about that that's what I I came to do to introduce him brother and sister but I I think John disciples around fussing about when you're in Father John they ain't falling you no more John they're following Jesus you see what I'm saying but yeah it may seem a little difficult for folks to understand the one that you supposed to be looking to is Jesus Christ are you with me the one that you need to understand amen oh Lord so so to prepare the way before the Lord whom you seek for he should suddenly come to his Temple the messenger was to introduce to you and I back to what Paul Peter and all of them preach Jesus Christ because a lot of times it's the little level the level of the lump and folks are caught up in a system and in church instead of understanding that it's the word that matters it's the word of God it's Jesus Christ that matters but people are so interested in protecting their ideal that's why they killed Jesus they were protecting Moses and Abraham and they thought he was coming against that the god that they was revealed to them was Jehovah god of the Old Testament and God is the spirit and this man being flesh is coming against what we believe in when he is better book he spreads of the Devils something wrong with him so they wouldn't go allow that to happen are you with me so they were defending their faith or what they believe that's what Saul on the way down to the Masters I mean he's going to bound and put him in jail men and women I'm protecting what I believe but Jesus was able to do it for himself right he was able to fight for you and I he defended in a light shine from heaven and he said saw Saul why persecute who thou me amen but Saul thought he was doing the what the right thing amen he was standing for what he had been taught and it was the Bible the one God the Jehovah God and he thought this person who was coming amen and he was actually coming against the faith are you with me I'ma tell your brother and sister except God reveal himself to you as an individual you will be trying to be one that's going to protect God and not God protecting you are you with me you'll get yourself caught up in fighting against folk and instead of preaching the gospel or living a life and in rejoicing in the Lord and getting all your blessing that God gave to you you end up getting in mass chaos and confusion foolish and unlearned question avoid you got a purpose in mind you are oh Jesus had his face like and he came to die on the cross he said I have a baptism to be baptized wealth and harmonize straighten until it be accomplished amen is set his face like a flint I gotta go amen I'm not letting nobody stop me from what I my destiny the bride has a destiny has a position has a place she she recognizes today as a it is it it's terrible it's it's rotten to the core but you got a destiny [Music] you got to know who you are let me just go over here uh Malachi 4 5. you got a position a place and the devil would do everything he can do you know somebody says well does God need uh appalling this hour does God need a prophet with you got the Holy Ghost don't need nothing that's the ideal that laodicea says we're rich and increasing good and we don't need nothing are you a fan so the attitude of the Christians that I got it I got everything I need I don't need nothing so there's no humility Rich High minded heady high-minded that's why people are not subject to Authority at all the world we live in no no humility people the world takes on that nature those that are in authority on the job and the different places and those that govern the country and uh they don't respect the police nobody people just oh goodness they just feel like we are at a place that they just do what they want to do people right got a right to do believe what I believe and do what I did and nobody tells me nothing have need of nothing are you with me so we don't need do you think the Pharisees started for one moment that they needed Jesus do you think the science seeds thought for one moment they needed Jesus so much and so in the layout to see a church Jesus is on the outside knocking on the door are you with him because this church age had put him out and we don't realize that this is an individual thing now it's you and God but you don't take the opportunity you look at the church collectively in a group a collected group and we call ourselves hey we the bride of Jesus Christ and all it's an individual all these people hollering and shouting don't have a revelation they just know when you say certain words and identify with that hey you know what I'm saying but a revelation is something that anchors your soul something that changes your life the Holy Ghost is revealed to you who you are that's why you live the way you live that's why you walk to where you walk that's why you love in spite of Amen what folks do to you say about you you still love them you can't help it because that's you that's your nature it's divine nature amen you see but if it's just a formality formality people some of the loudest Hollands and Screamers if you say certain things they're Holland scream brother and sister we don't want to get into that people jumping and shouting don't mean to understand and have a revelation of God's word the Revelation comes to you as an individual and it should be a change it should change your life are you with me when Jesus Christ come and revealed himself he said to Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church isn't that right it's a revelation that you receive and that's how you knew amen who I am amen My Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you in the same God got to reveal himself to you it doesn't matter how much I preach how much I teach or anybody else that could come amen and swear your head up if it don't get to your heart and change your life you still just a swole of hell amen praise God but when it comes down in your heart that makes you walk right live right amen nobody has to tell you how to dress and how to conduct your life you want to do it something inside you praise God you feel condemned you feel ashamed hey man I can't I can't I can't wear these kind of clothes I can't dress this way I can't walk this way I can't talk like this I feel something tuggling at me praise God it's the Holy Ghost condemning him praise God when there's the Holy Ghost there's nothing to condemn you nothing to check you nothing to tell you amen look at yourself what amen examine yourself where are you is this the way a Christian ought to act is this the way Christ amen you're grieving me amen praise God you I'm in the inside you'll be grieving the holy spirit this agreeing not the Holy Spirit what about you'll see him until the day of redemption amen God is grieved when he looked at the way we conduct ourselves and he's in the inside oh you're hurting amen praise God your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and you rely on this Temple Amen to be defiled are you with me don't defile the temple of God praise God with unbelief the way we conduct our lives and being elusion not really amen conducting our lives right it ought to be conviction we ought to be constantly repenting constantly saying God I'm sorry constantly is crying out Lord I need to draw closer Lord I want to draw closer Lord I need more of you amen God Touch Me Lord Lord I need Revival in my soul amen I need to shout of Victory amen the shot of the king is in the camp praise God not just in the church but in the camp in me praise God praise God I got something inside me and set my soul on fire I got to tell somebody about Jesus I got to talk about him I got to introduce oh Lord it's not about the church it was Jesus in you let me try this finish I went a little long in Mullins which in Beyond normal so it says Malachi 4 and 5. behold I send you see if it's not revealed to you then it's not for you he said behold I sent unto who you mm-hmm if it wasn't sent to you then it don't mean nothing to you but he said behold I send to you Elijah the prophet before what before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now show enough these bombs are going to fall and this world is going to be blowed to Pieces y'all see how they conducted everything that's showing you that this world has gone it's going in oh it's in bad shape every time you hear the killings the murders and all the immorality and all the filth and garbage that's been done you know we're bad the world is in a to rotten to the Core it's affecting our families it's affecting the schools it so it's affecting uh it is it's just bad it's terrible the kind of world we live in especially if you've been living a long time like some of us that's got some gray hair in our head and we've been around a little while and we just seeing it getting worse and worse are you with me and I feel for the children and the grandchildren and you're feeling amen what kind of world are they going to live in what kind of world can they exist is they going to be able to make it come down to marrying and having children and then you've got to raise them in such a cruel filthy evil world that's why the prophecy the God of this evil age it's evil that's why in the days of Noah you're sitting in every imagination of all the men hard was continually what Eva every imagination you see him and he said as it was in the days of Noah and I said it was in the days of Sodom amen that's the way it's going to be in the coming of the son of man are you with me so he says the purpose of Elijah is to turn the hearts of the children to to turn and he should turn the hearts of the fathers to the children John the Baptist did that in Luke 1. and 17. Luke 1 and 17. Luke 1 and 17. are y'all with me y'all feel all right tonight it's going to be all over with after a while the Rapture is going to take place and people are going to be sitting around sucking their lollipop and the Rapture take place in every say well I thought the Rapture would take place for Moses and Elijah over there preaching to the Jews and you looking for the Rapture to take place and is already taking place and you didn't know it still trying to be cute worried about the shoes you got in the house you live in the car you drive and how much money you got in the bank and the Rapture then took place your soul wasn't that important all these other things had more value to them people valued the right thing the Christians those that have set their bride say that they loved the Lord Jesus and they valued it they would fill the doors of the church you couldn't get a seat almost in here if everybody in the city abroad and said they want to go into rapture if they're really wanted to go they put some action with it say you want to go and sister Robinson say don't say don't get ready she said be ready don't get ready she said the Lord told us don't get ready be ready are you with me I believe that I believe that was from the Lord don't get ready but be ready are you with me and if you're not ready you know those those things will haunt you in that day that God spoke to a sister don't get ready but be ready and you fail to be ready you still was trying to get ready when you should have been ready as I said last night you got to have your own oil you got to have your own fire your own lamb got to be burning and you asked for some of my art I ain't got enough for you and me you got to go and buy for yourself isn't that right it's an individual thing and brother and sister don't get caught up in crew oh we're in the message come on that's on me but don't just get caught him in terminology amen and think that you all right you can just relax yourself and use it to happen but where's your life what do you stand with God how are you conducting your life does God still talk to you are you trying to do something to tell somebody about Jesus do you love him amen Luke 1 and 17 excuse me Lord have mercy and he shall go before him in the spirit talking about John the Baptist he should go before him in the spirit and the power of who Elijah to what see now you notice in Malachi 4 it says and he should turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and conjunction and the hearts of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the Earth with the curse some people say let's talk about the two witnesses in the Great Tribulation period the last part that's their largest talking about but it says before the great and Dreadful day great and drafted day is the Tribulation period John the Baptist fulfilled the first part of that but the last part and he should turn the hearts of the fathers to the children at least I come and smite the Earth with the curse are y'all with me God is going to Smite the Earth with the curse but he's going to send Elijah first are you with me and and God sent the prophet to get look what John came to do in 17 he says Luke 1 17 he shall go before him in the spirit and power of the lies to turn the hearts of the children uh the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Disobedience to the wisdom of the test to what to make ready what uh people see if they didn't hear John they didn't receive Christ are you with me with all the word they had they had to listen to John with all the word that Jews had they had to listen to Peter on the day of Pentecost Peter and all the rest of the Apostles this Peter said by Paul he spoke things hard for men to understand but he said you need you need to hear because if you don't you're gonna wrestle to your own destruction are you a man so Peter was telling you Paul was given abundance of Revelation Paul said it was given to me to the Gentiles don't you know the church ages are dealing with the Gentile church and God Amen blinded the eyes of the Jews that the Gentiles might be grafting in are you with me and Paul was to be a light to the Gentiles are you with me so we're dealing in the church agents dealing with the Gentiles but God Don't Turn back to the Jews are you with me and those Jews are going to accept Jesus Christ as their as the Messiah which they rejected him before because God blinded them for our sake are you with me so that's what has happened brother and sister but we don't feel a need of a prophet for this generation for this age but brother and sister we're in a mass without it we in terrible she God has he had a voice for this age and only those that are filled with the Holy Ghost that had the spirit he said he that has the ear let him hear what the spirit says without the Holy Ghost you listen intellectual with the Holy Ghost it's been revealed to you are you with me now folks just taken for granted but they have no Holy Ghost so when the pressure come with no Holy Ghost you're not gonna hold up praise God those that seem to be anointed but what an ordained to hear those that are ordained to eternal life bleed you got

Jesus Christ amen if you if you're not ordained to be the bride you will not be the bride are you with me John said come and I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife but you have to have a revelation
