we thank you tonight lord we appreciate you for all your grace and your mercy your goodness towards us lord we thank you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of second kings about god's grace second kings three and we'll begin here at the after let's begin at the sixth verse read a little bit second kings three and six if you got it say amen and it reads and the king jehoram went out of samaria at the same time and numbered all israel and he went and and and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab ever bailed against me well thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up and i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thou horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom so the king of israel went in the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetch the compass and of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said at last that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire by of the lord by him and one of the king of israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of elijah you may be seated i'll read a little further down the 12th verse says in jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother the king of israel said said unto him name for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand and of moab and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of the of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not have looked toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstrel and came to pass and when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the lord you shall not see wind neither neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water and that ye may drink both you and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and you shall smite every city every choice city and shall fail every good tree and stop all the wells of water and mar every good place of land with stones my god the bless to the reading of his word tonight by the grace of god just for a moment i want to minister on a little topic and i i entitled it inquiring of the lord and with a sub-topic did you pray about it amen did you pray about it you know i was looking here and how in the scriptures and a little something i was ministering on on sunday too but you know a little bit how you know israel at this time said in the scriptures how they were divided as a nation you know one point they were one people but then you know something took place and they they got divided and all but so there was a time they had split up but you know you know their strength was in their unity so as long as they were divided they were vulnerable and you know that's what the devil does i believe a lot of times to the people in a lot of churches today a lot of fellowships what he want to do he want to keep the people divided as long as he keeps you divided without that unity uh he it makes you that much more vulnerable and that's what i was sharing you know sunday morning i was saying you know you know we're not an organization or denomination but we every church is sovereign in itself but we still fellowship with one another because we carry the same beliefs and i said that that fellowship strengthens you when you find yourself on the island out there by yourself then that's when you find yourself more vulnerable but when you stay together come on and you stay in fellowship that you know when the enemy comes to attack you know like i was saying on sunday we're in a battle you're going to war and you're going to need somebody to help go to war with you i said what happens what what we do when we try to isolate ourselves i says then you say that ain't none of my business that ain't that ain't me but when the devil get done with them guess what he gonna do he gonna come to you next come on but it makes a difference that i says that if i see this brother here or this sister here going through or this church here or that church going through that we get down on our knees and we pray for them pray that god we go to war i said what it is then we don't give the devil no rest when because it's always somebody praying always somebody on their knees got you on their mind lord help him help him the devil don't get no rest does he and then what happens you know god shows up and that's that's what that's what the the strength and the unity is all about but that's what you know i said a lot of times you know what happens as i was i was saying you know the other day in churches you'll find out that everybody want to be the pastor or everybody want to be in charge and all these things you know and that says and that's what usually causes you know things to split that people have their groups you got your group they got their group but what it is that's the devil's job to do that to keep the holy ghost from falling you know it says that when they were in one place come on there's a one mind we know there's on one accord what happened the holy ghost fell down you know and that's what it is i don't know about you but i said that's what we want when we come together one mind one accord come on one mind that we want to see god move we want to see the supernatural we want to see the power of god we want to see somebody get healed we want to see somebody get saved we want to see somebody get delivered come on and when we all come with that mind come on and our mind is staring on him i said watch god moved in come on but what happens the devil comes in and he hey you just worried about you you just worried about you and all these things and that's what it is it's no unity there i said but watch watch what the devil does now i says when you sit there and watch the devil just attack them and you don't get down on your knees and pray when that's so witty coming to your house next come on we say that so many times even in the natural sometimes you look at it like in certain wars you could take world war ii for example they sat back and watched all right yeah he attacking this country uh uh hitler hitting there we ain't gonna worry about him we just gonna then he took over him took over and took over them and now you don't have enough resources to fight the enemy come on he's way stronger than you and i said that's what it is you and i as brothers and sisters in christ come on the blood of jesus christ has made us ken right come on brought us so nigh to one another hallelujah mata didn't know you until you until we came into the faith but nevertheless you are still my brother you still my sister when you hurt i heard come on when your children are going through i'm going through hallelujah when we find ourselves with that type of burden watch we'll come together how many believe that tonight what i say is that even you know we find that and i just want to you know like i said as we talk about inquiring of the lord but where there where there's unity you know uh uh there there's there's strength come on the devil don't like that he don't like the people the brother in the dwelling unity he don't like that he always want to keep this one pit against that one i always want to keep this uh this quarrels come on because he know like i was sharing with the church on sunday remember you got coral you got all you might as well not even get down to your knees and pray because the bible says god ain't even going to hear you you got to make that thing right come on these things are real then you wonder sometimes why you can't get a breakthrough why god didn't seem like he answered your prayer search your life search your heart search yourself see whether or not you lined up with the word of god or not come on then you can it's something about when you know that the channel is clear hallelujah you know that prayer is different when you know the channel's clear when you know things are right that's a different prayer that's a prayer that god hallelujah god hears nobody else heard it but god heard it you know a lot of times people spoke they said things nobody heard it but god heard it come on and that made all the difference that when god heard that cry or when god heard that prayer but just like as he hears your heart's crying that way he also hears your hearts crying a negative way as well come on and all of that makes a difference how many believe that tonight so what does it teach us to do watch what we say watch what we think even in our spirit come on i missed it once on what did heaven hear i said sometimes you can not even say things from your mouth but just by your actions when it got up to heaven it had a cry come on it created your actions created a voice and god heard what you said even though you said i didn't say it hallelujah but god heard it anyway when it got up to heaven that's how it hurt that's how it was heard so we what do we say lord search our hearts try our reigns keep us clean keep us pure lord that when it goes up to heaven god all you get is a sweet spell and savior praises going up to you hallelujah i don't know about you but that's where i said we want to be at come on in our hearts that's the only way we're going to take a rapture that's the only way i said the the thing is like was talking saying here you know the king of israel and those that they were afraid because moab was coming and they knew that hey by ourselves we ain't going be able to face them by ourselves you know we're gonna be destroyed come on we got to come together i see jehoshaphat saying you know yo we as one mine is yours but you know he was joking up with some unbelief though come on so that's why we said you can't just joke up with anything now come on and expect god to bless that that's not what we're talking about but we're talking about those of light faith come on those hallelujah the household of god do you believe that tonight come on because now we're fighting what are we fighting fighting these plagues fighting demon powers fighting things that we can't see so we got to go to war how we gonna go to the wall you got to put your spiritual we got to get your spiritual warfare come on you got to grab the shield of faith the prophet of god was saying something about faith he was saying when you're trying to figure figure it out then that's why that's why many times people can't get the miracles they can't get the healings because they trying to figure it out they thinking about it too much don't think about it believe god and go on we always tell people bring your burdens to the lord and leave them there don't get up worrying about it thinking about it put it on the altar lay it at the cross hallelujah get up and don't worry about it your job is to praise god hallelujah you believe that tonight but you're thinking about it too much come on you didn't leave it there you carried it to the lord but then you took it back home with you you got off your knees and you carried it with you come on but you know i was praying on something the other day i was thinking about something and uh they're dealing with but it's something about rising up early in the morning and getting down on your knees and praying hallelujah asking god to make the way for you something about that come on but as i got down on my knees in prayer it's like it's like the divine inspiration or something just came to me and showed me exactly how to take care of the situation i thought about it i said lord see that's how god works you spend all your time trying to figure it out trying to worry about it doing all this come on but if you're got down on your knees like we're saying of the week if you'd have been still took it to god in prayer inspiration may have come hallelujah god would have showed you how to work that thing out and you to god up saying lord i didn't even think about that way come on but if you're the only inquired of the lord hallelujah ask god about it hallelujah that's why i said did you pray about it come on but we find that you know that's what something i was stirred up about that he says you thinking about it too much come on don't that faith is you just take it you believe and go on because it ain't your business to bring it to pass come on god is god's business to keep his word and once we learn that miracles will start happening come on things will start coming together things will begin working out for you because you learn how to give it to god hallelujah but we find that i says you know that that you know they they found themselves they came together and i know i want to kind of speed along but i says and even though they came together and he saw that the enemy was coming no he couldn't stand with him so he says come on we got to come together but the biggest mistake they made was that when they went on this journey but when they come together they never inquired of the lord the bible says they went on so many days journey of compass and then they found themselves stranded out there in the desert come on found themselves stranded in a place where they had no water hallelujah then after they got to that place then they realized now we're in worse shape now than we were from the beginning i said that's what it is it ain't just about coming together come on and just talking and running them out and all these other things come on then you might find yourself in worse shape hallelujah but somebody got to be spiritual in the camp somebody got to have spiritual discernment somebody got to know what god is doing how many believe that tonight hallelujah let's pray let's pray let's pray everybody pray jesus thank you jesus hallelujah lord jesus lord you said that god that i'm the lord thy god that healeth thee lord i pray right now lord by the holy ghost god that you might touch our dear sister god that the hand of god might be upon a life god you were wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon you and with your stripes we've been healed tonight jesus we need you jesus we need your touch god we need your presence lord here we are lord standing before you god looking for a miracle lord looking for you to be
