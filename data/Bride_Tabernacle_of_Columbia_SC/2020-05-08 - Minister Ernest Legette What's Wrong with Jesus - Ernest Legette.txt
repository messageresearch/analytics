to look at the Book of Luke by God's grace Luke 23 God is good a man Luke 23 and we'll begin at the beginning at the first verse and it reads and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king and Pilate said and Pilate asked him saying art Val the king of the Jews and he answered and and said thou says it then said Pilate to the chief priests into the people I find no fault in this man and there and they were there the more they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jury jury beginning from Galilee to this place and when Pilate when Pilate heard of the of Galilee he asked whether he whether the man were Galilean and as as soon as he knew that he belong unto Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who himself also had was at Jerusalem at that time and when Herod saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desires to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to see have seen some miracle done by him to any question with him in many words but he answered him nothing and the chief priests and the scribes stood really accused stood and V hemily accused him and Herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate the same the same day Pilate inherit were made friends together for before they were at intimate enmity between themselves and Pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people he said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that preferred the people in the whole I have examined him before you and found no fault in this man touching these things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet Herod for our sin you to him and lo nothing worthy of death worthy of death is unto Him I was therefore chastise him and release him for of a necessity he must release one of them that had to feast and they cried out all at once and away with this man and release unto us Barabbas who for a certain sedition made in the city and murder was cast into prison therefore I mean Pilate therefore willing to release Jesus spake unto them and but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time Why What evil have he done I have found no cause of death in him I was there for chastising and let him go and they were instant with the law requiring that he might be crucified the voices of them of the chief priests prevail and Pilate gave sinners that it should be as they required may God add the blessing to the reading of his word by God's grace tonight I just want to minister to you on a little something that the Lord put on my heart and I entitled it what's wrong with Jesus I said what's wrong with Jesus you know is very sitting here that we're reading today it is not only in this time that time but you know we say as a whole God you know God has always been rejected as a whole though people just never want it God for some reason for some reason you just can't grasp it in your mind why people don't want God you know the one that that made them the one that's creative all things the one that has the power we say to be get you back up out of the grave again give you eternal life he has all that all these things at his disposal you know he can judge you he can you can be eternally separated or you can be have eternal life with him but you know you can he's got the power in his hand to heal you he's got the power in his hand to deliver you to bless you abundantly above all things but yet for some we say odd reason people just don't want God don't understand it I was sitting there at the table the other day meditating I said for about an hour I said what's wrong with Jesus why people don't want so we find that you know I said as a whole the world has always rejected rejected God you know I went back and my mind I said how you know God told Samuel in one place he said Sam it ain't you that reject him it ain't you that they're rejecting but it's me he says they don't want me to reign over them they don't want me to rule over come on they'd rather have a man or something to rule over them because the thing about it a man might bend he might you know try to look over your faults and let you slide here there but it's something about people he said they it ain't you Sam you it's not the problem ain't with you the problem is with them they just don't want me and I said Lord why don't people want God and I said you know what happens is you know and even God told Samuel he says they didn't just start neither he said it's always been that way their fathers and their fathers and their fathers before them he said it always been that way they just they just don't they don't want God to reign over they don't want me to be their ruler and we're dealing with the same thing even here today you know the Spirit is still even lingering in the earth today people want to have church but they don't want God to be in there they want to have revival but they don't want Jesus there come on but how you gonna have revival without Jesus in the Miss how you gonna have Church without Jesus being there but he said that's that's just the way they wanted he said it's always been that way you know I thought about how you know when he when they was brought up out of Egypt you know and the thing is you know the first thing they did they said come on when they brought us out of Egypt they say when they soon they got out they said we want a calf come on you know the one you look at as what happened to him even Moses went into the mountain for some days and looked like he hadn't come back then the first thing they began to talk to Moses the way they begin to talk to Moses was they said we don't know what happened to this man come on not even giving him any kind of respect what happened to this man come on and I said what happens we find out today in the church world that people one of the one of the first thing they do is is they lose respect for the ministry come on and when they lose respect for the ministry then not knowing it within itself that's who God's using that's God's mouthpiece that's how God is sending a word to help you a word to bless you a word to keep you out of the trouble that's getting ready to come ahead a word to prepare you for the oncoming storm but yet they lose respect and when you lose respect for that what is it you lost respect for God because why that's just God's order God's God God's got a program God's got order come on but a lot of times everybody just want to as we use the terminology I want to do their own thing come on but God's got to order God's got a program come on and I I was saying you know to myself I said sometimes we don't like we saying we don't understand the road we going down we don't understand what God is taking us to but I was praying I said Lord just as we say in a song Lord no matter or whatever you're doing in this season God don't do it without me I don't have to be in the front the front line I don't have to be in the front of it I can be in the back somewhere on my knees praying but God whatever you doing Lord please don't do it without me God don't let me miss my don't like they say I'm on my way to heaven enjoy the trip don't let me miss the trip God whatever you doing Lord don't do it without me cuz even right now don't you know God is doing something this we enter season right now and God is doing something and the devil is busy they say but God is real come on I was I was meditating I said you know the enemies like a Floyd God's got to be lifting up a standard and if he's lifting up a standard I said God let me get me in that place I don't know no weights holding me down but God I want to be lifted up with you Lord but I said what it is people don't want God they don't want Jesus Wow that's the question we asked ourselves sometimes why I said you know the thing about it is you know we was talking about how they lost respect for Moses they lost his respect for the ministry but you know what it was a time when it was happy to see Moses coming it was a time even when they were still in bondage when Moses came on the scene oh the joy that fill their hearts when Moses came down and was and was we call it like this ministering the Pharaoh telling the Pharaoh to let the people go come on and they burned and start being easy and eased up yet all of a sudden Pharaoh just had to release the people it was a time where they enjoyed the man of God when they enjoyed they they were blessed even though Moses might have had some hard sermons though Moses might have preached some things they didn't like it was a time they needed God help they didn't they were in bondage they needed help so they wanted Guardian come on and I say that that's what we faced with today when people don't they don't they don't want guard until they get in bad shape until they hurtin until they going through and they can't see their way out until doors shut all in their face hallelujah till they in the midnight out and it looks like that all hope is lost then they cry out lord have mercy on me but all before you don't want him come on but they know that he's the only one can get him out of the shape that they're in well we find that and I said that's what it is my title tonight is what's wrong with Jesus come on I said people don't want them today get in trouble you know they reject it you know Oh God and Samuel thought I told him you know that that uh it ain't you that rejecting this me and see the thing is they don't they didn't see or what was getting ready to take place they didn't see the life was getting rid of cone they didn't they didn't think about that all they were thinking about was in the moments the Bible says they said that we want to be like the other nations we want to be like everybody else pretty much God leave us alone we get little we try to being different as a minister problem was preaching the other night a peculiar we don't want to be peculiar we want to be like everybody else God leave us alone but they didn't see the life was in the Brewin they didn't see the Philistine army I don't think you know I think about Gideon and all them there they didn't see a time was gonna come whether it was gonna be running they was gonna have to hide the blessings that God gave them because if the enemies saw it he was gonna take it from them they didn't they didn't see those times coming she didn't want God but I find I said the thing is though you know looking at all these things I said they I don't you don't understand sometimes why but even in all of that you know God is still merciful come on time and time again God when you when the people cry unto Him God always hears somehow it turns the ear and he hears their cry he said if my people that are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray seek my face and turn from their wicked ways God as I was ministering on love the other day God's love is just something at a place we'll never be able to understand without the Holy Ghost you won't never be able to understand or why God do the things that he does but we find that I said I said what's wrong with Jesus the people never want him until they got in trouble until you know Goliath showed up you know I was thinking about a scripture how in Ezekiel I believe it was Ezekiel 16 and how God was just looking at the condition that Israel had gotten in and then he he sent in a man a prophet he's just reminding him come on he said you know what let me take them back in their mind just where they were before I found them he says you know you were in bad shape before I found you come on and know time did any man ever go seeking out the God but God sought out to him you can't say that I found God you didn't find God God found you you never came God to begin to draw in on you and as you felt that deep call to the deep you responded but it was God the whole time and I believe that but you know he says in Ezekiel he says let me remind him he says you were in bad shape one time come on you don't know just how bad of a shape yours in he said your mama your mother hands you out in the streets said she was polluted in your own blood he said she needed built unable from you he says but you Atlanta he said and everybody walked by you come on your friends all that we were saying just paraphrase and everybody walked by you nobody wouldn't help you come home you he said they was sitting there waiting on you to die come on and I think about that I think about where the Lord pick me up from I think about how many that male looked at me and even said he ain't gonna never be nothing he go you know he gone too far or this boy never be nothing in life and then looking at my condition every wasn't for the grace of God none of us wouldn't never be nothing in life and he even right now we're only where we are because of what he made us and no one else that's it only because of what he doing God picked us up you don't how many god people God picked up and they wouldn't give God the glory so he put him right back we got him from and the second time was worse than the first I said God don't put me down Lord Oh God don't let me go I said Lord don't take your hands off me go hard but God I want to be thankful every day god I'm living it one day at a time God thank you for picking me up thank you for keeping me Lord I think we all I think I know we all God come on we owe him that but I said people don't want God God had the reminder come on he said he said you were in bad shape people walk by you they they wanted you to die he says but I saw you come on and when I saw you I looked at you and I said Lee off he said I picked I cleans up come on I dressed you odd oranjee he said it and I nourished you I spread my skirt up upon you God did some good things for you he said I did some great things for him he said but remind him where they came from because what it was after a certain period of time then they begin to say they didn't want to be called by the Lord name no more after they got on their feet they say okay you know it was a time when the Lord picked you up you know you thought it was an S it was necessary to pray you thought it was necessary to fast you thought it was necessary before you lay it down at night not to let the Sun go down on your wrath you thought it was necessary to read your Bible more than if you didn't even have nothing to eat or drink you thought it was necessary to stay in the word when God saves you you thought it was a necessity but when God sometimes we're getting the blessings we get relaxed we get to the point the way we can go out there - without praying we can even go out there - it up reading the Bible but God got to remind us where I picked you up from where I brought you from I want you to get back to that place hallelujah and I believe that and that's why I believe sometimes what God does guard stirs the pot some time I say as the Eagle stirs her nest guard stirs the nest sometimes God sends storms he does things some time to get us back you know to that place of what we would call a necessity in our lives that where we we need God we need are certain things we need to thrive off of you know you know Jesus said at one point he said I'm the vine and you're the branches he says you know and because when he was speaking of those things you know he says you take that branch away from the vine then that branch is gonna die you know all of the fruit you might see coming from that branch and you might see that branch striving but where it's getting its life from it's the vine and he's saying that come on you might be blossoming but if you if I cut you off or you get cut off you gonna blossom no more you gonna die come on so we have to stay connected up with him come on we got to stay connected up with that vine that's what keeps striving I was sharing with someone the other day uh-uh uh-uh I mean my to be enough forget what day it was what I was saying what it is you got to understand how God speaks I could tell you a lot of my experiences and how God speaks to me and hard no you know it's the Lord I said for one thing you annoyance the Lord you'll know if it's not the Lord if it ain't his word come on but sometimes God does something and it just leaves you out there in the air says but nobody can't be the Holy Ghost for you come on no man can be God for you a man can lead you to Christ but you got that you got to have a personal experience do with him you got to get down on your knees long enough to build a relationship with him that when he speaks you'll know that it's him speaking that you don't always come to a man for questions because a man don't always have the answers but God's got all the answers and sometimes when God don't answers we just have to have patience to wait on him but what is it you having a relationship with Christ that's what we enjoy we enjoy having an open communication with God you know they talk about in a marriage its head like a communication to kill a marriage come on and you being married to God Christ you know you being hit his bride the Lambs wife like a communicational kill that marriage as well come on and destroy it why because you don't you don't understand what God is saying come on you you don't you're not in tune with God and that's what we want to be in tune with God in tune with the Holy Ghost how many believe that tonight but I say I said you know what's wrong what's wrong with Jesus you know I think about here you know here like we said people they don't want God but we find that they're hearing the Scriptures you know I was just sitting there meditating it broke it brought tears to my eyes sitting there meditating and I even in prayer I just like just got so emotional just thinking about I said you know they really hated Jesus I they hate it I said what I said Lord why do they hate you so bad but you know we know that in the scriptures even it says that the Jews were blinded come on for that purpose but I said Lord even even in that I said God today why do people hate you so bad why I said that they hate it they hate it oh Jesus are so bad but you know in the scriptures I look at how you know Pilate come on he when he when they brought Jesus to him the Bible says that they were they were accusing him he was man he did this Jesus they always got something wrong they had a bunch of stuff wrong with Jesus come on what was anything wrong with him when he fed the 5000 wasn't anything wrong with him when he was doing all this miracles in and all the signs and wonders over the chief priests and the scribes they still hated him but you know in that point but I says you know when he they might have didn't like when he rebuked them and beat him out the temple they might of didn't like when he began talking hard and rush rough to him but the thing about it is you know they hated him I said Lord widely why they hate him so bad and even Pilate Pilate I thought I begin the minute I say Pilate examining Jesus come on and even after all the accusation Pilate says I don't see nothing wrong with him come on out all that y'all accusing Jesus of I don't see nothing wrong with the man come on I asked a question tonight what's wrong with Jesus he said I ain't going I ain't gonna kill him I ain't gonna do what y'all ask them I can't find no fault in him hallelujah I can't find nothing wrong with him and I want to say tonight I don't know about you but I can't find nothing wrong with Jesus he's only been good to me he might he might have whipped me sometimes he might ain't y'all ways give me what I wanted but God been good to me I don't know about you but I can't find no fault in them when I think about the goodness of Jesus and all he's done for me my soul cries out come on why because he made it for my good god mean it for my good I believe that but that's what it is pilot says I don't know I know I ain't find no father come on I said what's wrong with Jesus I think about here in the scriptures how we read and even after Pilate examine him he said you know what I ain't gonna I wasn't who put judging on I'm gonna send him over to here come on when he get over to Herod I like how the Bible says Herot was glad to see Jesus said that he had been wanting to see him for a long time why because I believe he heard about the goodness of Jesus I believe he heard about Jesus miracles and the Bible says that he desired to see a miracle the Bible says he were glad to see Jesus I want to say anybody still yet in the world today glad to see Jesus wanting to see Jesus wanting to have more than just church but I want to see Jesus and when Jesus comes in the building they're glad to see Jesus hallelujah I said Lord I'm glad to see you I don't know about you but I won't Church I want Jesus I don't want to see him man give me jesus that's who I want I like that hair it says he says the Bible says he was blade he say he wanted to see a miracle done bound I believe her might have got frustrated with him when Jesus would never had some a word but he said then they begin to mock him and all that but he said even in all of that he said man I ain't find no fault in him neither come on he might ain't do the miracle I want to see but I still don't see nothing in this man worthy of death I still don't see nothing adding up to the accusations that y'all gotta get some come on hallelujah that's what it is people complaining about Jesus they don't want God why because they came it's even he was telling them in Ezekiel you know you wanna use you wanna be blessed you wanna be adorned in my apparel but you want to do what you want to do but it don't work that way come on we have to find out sometimes it don't work that way God's got away that you can't go on God's got away that she can't go round you've got to come in by the door and he said Strait is the gate and narrow is the way only you don't find it come on only a few you know it said that in this age they doubted us you talk about in the days a lot and all those how I couldn't find 10 come on but I don't know it's something in my heart believing that I'm one of them it's something in my heart that still ain't gonna give up and say I'm just going against the odds come on but I believe that in my heart God didn't save me for no reason and you got to be convinced that no matter what you're going through God brought you in the kingdom at the time for this God's got a purpose for your life God's got something he want to do for you oh you got to do it let go and let God have his way in your life let go and let the Holy Ghost do what he want in your life it's not about us but it's about him come on and that's what it is you know I was sharing with someone that and I was like you know that's what it is you you got to find yourself come on sometimes you just do things until you find yourself you pray and you pray and ask God God will lead you and you'll find your position and when you find your position like we say you're thrive you that you find your gift you'll be a blessing it and nobody won't be able to replace you why because a man didn't give you that gift God gave it to you and once you just yield that gifts of God and you know a lot of times we as individuals have problems yielding the r32 gift that God gave us we have problems with yielding it completely back to God why because sometimes the flesh gets all involved and we desire within ourselves and and we can't say no man can say he don't even Paul talked about already man that I am he said who gonna deliver me from this body come on even even Paul and in his issue that he had going on he said he sought the Lord twice but the Lord said I allowed that he said so you won't think of yourself no greater than you ought to be come on so what it is you are says sometimes we even in finer your position I pray every day I said Lord help to give the gift back to you lord help me to Lord give it back to you because if I can't give it back to you God they don't you know you could perish with that gift the Bible says gifts and callings at all repentance but if you give that gift fully over to God come on and let God use you in that and that way then the glory of God you didn't got to be appreciative we didn't God got to be a single musician whatever God's use it it's change get God when the anointing comes down that's what it is when the presence of God come down it breaks yokes off people lives you know David had a gift that he could play the harp I think it was but I but I believe that when he played that heart change was broken our souls lives the Bible said the evil spirit had to leave on what it was David my team fully understand he might have just been playing or the heart but what it was God was it was the gift it was something that that when it was yielded to God it was bringing God down on the scene and that's what I said God teach us all help us all God learn how to get out of the way and even when we get in ourselves get us back on our knees again remind us Lord that we ain't nothing without you and we need your help Lord every day but I said what's wrong with Jesus come on even here you know say he couldn't find nothing wrong nothing in them so you look at and I says you know he's sitting them back over - over over to Pilate and even when he's sitting him back to Pilate Pilate the Bible say examine him again he said I can't find no fault on he says and he asked the people question I believe it was found here and here in the twenty the 22nd verse he says he says in the 22nd verse and he said unto them the third time because he a keep questioning Pilate begging them why why y'all don't want Jesus bagging with them pleading with him what's wrong with him come on I can see even the people today I see the ministry you know or the ones of us of you that have accepted Christ and living for them begging with people pleading with people why Jesus come on the devil got plans for you as Jesus told Peter once he said the devil he said the enemy desire to sift you as wheat but I prayed for you come on the devil desire tonight even right now in the midst of the crisis the pandemic that we're going through now their sin or the hornet's does what they call wherever they call them the killer Hornets then they talk about the dynamic monster all these things that's hitting the earth even in the midst of all that people still don't want Jesus what's wrong with what's wrong with Jesus you know he can save you from all these things he can shelter you in the midnight hour and all this going on but people still don't want him what's wrong with Jesus I think about Polly here the Bible says the third time he asks what's wrong with him come on he said why he said why what what evil have you done come on he said I find no cause of death to them he said I ain't gonna kill him I'm I'm gonna let him go I might chastise him but I'm gonna let him go I ain't got I wanna do it but they kept crying out do it so then even I thought about I says you know just for the sake of time I look at I says you know what they did they said instead of Jesus you know the Bible says that Barabbas was a man causing sedition and murdering in the city come on we don't want Jesus well give us this man that's drowning and seducing people that's committing all these crimes give us a killer that's what we won't give us him you know so he get out so he'd come out kill some all of us come on he'd come out and do some more damage in the city that's what we want you know that's what they was asking for come on and that's what it is don't we got to realize you know the devil is designed I would say to sift you as wheat the devil is just designed to break your home up the devil is designed to destroy your family the devil is destroying to have your design have you on a bed of affliction the devil is desiring one day to see you go to the lake of fire come on but is in sometimes you crying out I don't want Jesus you know I'm thinking about yeah you know to reject the Holy Ghost is to receive the mark of the beast come on you don't want the Holy Ghost what else is there left but the mark of the beast it's times like these they say we need a revival I said Lord what's wrong with what's wrong with Jesus you know Pilate even here was trying to plead with him but even in all of his pleading they still said we don't we don't want him you know we won't give us Barabbas we just we just want you to to kill him I said to myself I said you know just sitting there thinking the other day I says you know that today you know we beg and we plead with people but we said what's the matter with Jesus I began to think I said maybe maybe sometimes oh that person they never been I thought about that song he did it for me I said maybe they never felt lost and alone I said maybe they never are being at the bottom of the bottom maybe they never seen themselves in a dark place I said maybe you know they never been hurt in a free and in God come by in delivered there maybe they ain't ain't never experienced that God ever did anything from that day no war come on because God's mercies are new every day God a lot of times he guarded you and safeguards you and blessed you you didn't even know what was around the corner but God had his angels protecting you I said maybe maybe then had them times where people looked down on them and talked about them to where they cried at night maybe it ain't bid on a bed of affliction and God healed him maybe they ain't never been in those position maybe that's why they don't want the Lord come on I said God why they don't want you it's bad sometimes God got to do certain things they did us to call his name it's bad sometimes the guard got to bring us to certain levels of loners in our life for us to give him gratitude and thank him enough I said God I've been there I don't know about you but I've been in that place I've been in that dark spot I've been in those places with nobody don't want nothing to do which I've been there come on but I know it that time God picked me up from that place so I said you know they got all kind of names from you can call them he'll deliver them but I know as a savior I know as a redeemer one who saved me from a life of sin and shame I know him as a redeemer one who even when I was in my worst time but when I gave my life to Him came down with his spirit and filled me up that's what I know him is come on but I says maybe that's why I said and you know but the thing is I thought to myself I was in prayer I said Lord you know I said to me god I say your Savior you my Savior and you're my Redeemer I said Lord that's why I love you so much I says my life still ain't perfect I said but God you're my Savior you matter to others that might not be what they're looking at you but I said god I want you Lord give me you come on they sang the song give me you come on everything else can wait God give me you that that's all that's what I need I say guard I want you Lord when everybody else is saying well it's complaining about you and rejecting you and don't want to line up which I said God give me you Lord that's what I want God I want you I want your presence Lord I want your spirit every day of my life God I want you I can't find no fault in your Lord come on but we find that I said that's what that's why you know we love him so much I wanna let me jump down because I know I'm taking a lot of time here you know I was thinking about something here and here in the 27th verse what we're talking about what's wrong with Jesus here in the 27th verse you know Luke 23 and 27 he says when you know and and there followed him a great company of people and a women which also be weld and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that a bear in the past which never gave suck then shall they begin to see the mountains to say to the mountains fall on us to the hills cover us for if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry and there were also two other male factors led with him to be put to death and and when they were come to the place was called Calvary there they crucified him and the male factors one of the right hand and all on the left and she and then said Jesus Father forgive them for the forgive them for they know not what they do and they departed his raiment and cast lots you know I said what's wrong with Jesus you know one thing I thought about I says when the people yeah we says when they don't want God when they reject him that's cuz they don't see what's getting ready to come you know they didn't want Jesus but you know the Bible says here that it was women you know and coming in behind them and they was well but Jesus he turned to them on his way to California to die you know when he was on his way there he turned around and he looked at the women and he began to tell the women he said don't weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children come on he said because the day coming you're gonna wish you never had children you don't people gonna run to the mountains and say mountains fall on us and I said what it is I says when when you reject Christ you know it ain't that you necessarily gonna suffer these things but he said your children they gonna bear the worst part of it your children come on he said not daughter don't weep for me but for yourselves and for your children come on that's why even in the scriptures it says to train up a child in a way that should go and it won't depart from him come on I said he said you know in all this he said this is what's getting ready to take place and I thought about that I said how do you reject Christ today when you reject the word how do you who safai them again today when you crucify how do he's landed again today when you reject his word why because he is the word you said in that day I wouldn't I did that to Jesus well how is your reaction to the word today how do you react when the word is being preached today how do you react when the word come to you do you receive the word or do you reject the word do you receive the will do you eat the whole book or do you take the book and cut it up into pieces and live it kind of way you want to live come on how how you do the word the Word of God now that's how you would have did Jesus even back then come on but we find that I was thinking about that I said Lord Jesus told him he said don't weep for me but weep for yourselves come on they didn't see what was getting ready to come up the road he's heading for your children he said it's gonna come a date you gonna you gonna you gonna curse today that you even had children come on and they'll holler right to the car to the mountains and the heels fall on us I says you know we living in such a day to day as today this man we faced with things the world has never seen before the world like we keep saying over and over and never be the same we're looking at chaos upon chaos we looking at next nobody don't know what's gonna happen next come on don't know we saying that we used to say even though we're all it's falling apart well my friends I'm afraid that the world has already fell apart and there's no repairing it come on the only thing it is now it's for us like we say to get an ark of safety get into Christ Wow he's still available come on while God is still bringing conviction on your heart you know it's a scary thing that you can hear the word but yet your heart can be so hard and they don't have no effect on you God can minister to your spirit but your heart can be so hard and that you don't you don't want to get right come on that's that's scary and a dangerous place to be in but even in the place where we are now I said God I need more I need more of your spirit God that's what I need that's what it's gonna take the demons and the things that we battle in the day we can't fight them within ourselves we got no defense outside of the Holy Ghost outside of his spirit leading and God as our eyes can't be closed all the time here's can't be shut all the time you know these five senses the gates that the devil use come on it's got to be the Holy Ghost come here take control of those gates to guard you keep things out of your spirit that are getting their corrupt you a lot of times I believe people have things going on with them and they don't even know where it came from they don't even know how it got access porn but some kind of way through some gate a demon power God in let's don't to this so it's gonna take the mercy of God they're causing the tournament come on what I say god help us god help my children God help my house my home my family Lord why we live in it some dangerous times we live it in the times like we said where the people don't want God they want things to get back to normal they don't want God they just want to go back to having church they don't want God they just want to get any money back right come on they want to go back to the beach again they don't want go hard they worried about they gonna miss the summer vacation they don't want God they worried about missing him it's true people don't want God they don't want to get out on their knees and cry out but even in these times right here I believe God got somebody you know winner even one Elijah thought he was all alone he said I got seven thousand that's still crying out how many believed that tonight you know God is so good to us his love is just by Everlast he's so kind and merciful to us I think about I says you know they hated them and even the people you know today they hate God what's wrong with Jesus that's that's just a question I wanted to ask what's wrong with Jesus the song says what's the matter with Jesus he's alright amen we serving a god that's good and I was thinking about the song where the going the scenes in the Lord keep blessing me and he keep blessing me right now and I thank God for the word that we heard tonight God keep on blessing me he meant keep right on blessing me and I said tonight as we listen to so many people can find fought in a lot of things to pretend no fault we can find in Jesus amen and another song says he never failed me yet praise God we fail him all the time we failed him but he never fails us everything is more than then we can imagine more than we can axle think and what he does for us he gives us more than we deserve to have he gives us more grace not just a little bit of grace with more grace because we are still in a body that's against it our body in our flesh our flesh man this warned against our spirit man and we are constantly in a battle that's what Paul says when I desire to do good evil is present with me we're constantly in a conflict the Satan and God there's something about God in God's children you don't have to do anything for the devil to be upset with you you don't have to say anything for the devil not to like you all you've got to do is be a son or daughter of God but you got to realize that it's because of who you are you bless just from being a son or daughter God and these trials in afflictions that we are go to they're just light afflictions they're light because there's a greater blessing that's waiting on us so all of our troubles and all our toes and everything that we go through we know it's just for a moment what is a moment compared with eternity just a moment just a vapor it's here today and gone tomorrow just a fading flower we're only passed to this life a little season but as an eternity waiting on the sons and daughters of God God got a blessing waiting on you just look god amen God got a blessing if you would only look like amen God wants to help you he meant better you don't look up you're never see
