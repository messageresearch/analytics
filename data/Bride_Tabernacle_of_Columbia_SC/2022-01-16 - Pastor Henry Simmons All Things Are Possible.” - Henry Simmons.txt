generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they bought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tapped him and he fell on the ground and wallowed forming and he asked his father how long is it a goal since this came unto him and he said of a child and of time it has cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us jesus said unto him if thou can believe all if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believeth god bless you in his word you may be seated if god can believe all things are possible amen now amen the man needed help and when you need help amen praise god you got to know where you can get some help from but david said in psalms 121 i will lift my eyes into the heels from whence coming to my help for he said my help cometh from the lord that made the heavens and earth there was another place it says is there anything too hard for god so with god all things are possible so here the man said lord if you can do anything if you can do anything it's not if god can god can they meant god can do all things and he said i can do all things through christ that strengthened me [Music] it's not if god can we know that god is more than able to do what the word said praise god we're not serving a god that cannot do we are serving a god that can do all things all things are possible amen the song says all things are possible only only believe all things are possible praise god we sin no the earth is shaking the world is they meant turned upside down the trauma is hitting the world from every angle as the power outage is going on and came to church this morning and amanda had power and then the power went out and then we said god if it's possible if if god willing amen he'll let the power come on and we'll be able to go alive this morning and so we thank god that he gives us a little grace this morning in space amen that we're able to have amen live service so by the grace of god here we are this morning all things are possible to them that believe amen but we find out that many times folks who believe but they believe only for a cease and they believe and sometimes they amen they come to places in their lives amen till they give up amen they don't keep on believing it comes to a place amen when folks tell you amen amen uh that it's no use in believing no it's too late now in john 11 and 39 11 39 jesus said take away the stone martha take away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him lord talking about ladders by this time he stinketh i said with god all things are possible ladders had been dead four days and uh amen and he had began to model mortify everything is gone skin worms eaten if you ever smelt somebody that they meant that is dead and rotten then it's a smell that you know it exceeds the smell sometimes of animal but when a human being is dead it's an awful smell and uh she didn't want the stone to be taken away because of the stink that they was gonna smell you know it looked like an impossible situation because it was too late and i said don't give up your faith for with god all things are possible amen don't look at the circumstance don't look at the condition don't look at what you're going through don't look at what you've been through but look at what the word said jesus said i am the resurrection in the life he that liveth and believing in me shall never die brother and sister there's no death in jesus amen praise god he said come to me amen and jesus wants to give you life and that you might have it more abundantly amen with jesus christ amen no matter how stink the situation is no matter how your sins are no matter what you've done or what you've been through our god is able all things are possible to them that would believe so i believe that martha was a believer amen i believe that she believed that jesus christ amen was the messiah and all that sometimes we we said we're christians and we believe she had enough confidence in him that if he had been there the brother would not have died amen but he's here now and your situation that seemed to be hopeless he's here now you might have thought that he showed up too late too late to change your situation but i said god amen still had control amen he can help you amen when it seems like it's too late somebody said he's an old time god oh yes he is so god is he's here right now this morning he's here now amen to give you praise god that oh god that if you did if you got enough faith not to give up if you got enough faith to believe that god in spite of all that is transpired in all that has happened if you have enough faith in god if you can only trust god this morning if you can only believe this morning then god is able to give you victory this morning they give you amen that which you stand in need of this morning amen i believe that somebody they may have a need this morning and because you have a need this morning i believe that god is here this morning to give you amen praise god for deliverance victory in spite of how dark it may seem amen i believe the light has come and he cannot fail you and he will not fail you he's not going to leave you in condition in that sad condition he saw the state of martha and mary and he saw the state amen the bible said jesus wept amen praise god but he he met praise god when he got there amen he knew amen that all things were possible he knew that he meant you don't have to stop believing now you don't have to give up right now amen because he's able to do the impossible i i wish somebody would trust god to go beyond amen what they can see what they can feel amen even what you can think amen just hold to god's unchanging hand because the word of god approved his own word he'll prove himself to be faithful to those that would only believe they'll find out that god will amen praise god give you amen and expect it in that god will do exceedingly abundantly that god will bless you when it seems like the enemy has cursed you amen god will change the situation when they were packed up to the red sea and seemed as though he meant the egyptian army was coming amen and there was no way to get out they were trapped amen oh god it looked like they were going to be a prey to the enemy but god said amen hallelujah don't cry speak amen it's time amen to go forward amen let's go forward because with god all things are possible amen this red sea that's in front of you amen i said trauma might look like it's in front of you amen but you can come on and march forward amen don't look like it's trouble amen i'm going forward in the name of jesus i'll go forward i'm going to pass through my troubles god will divide your troubles up and let you go through hallelujah and the enemy that's behind you that's look like it's gonna overtake you god let your enemy drown amen praise god hallelujah
