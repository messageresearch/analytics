[39:01] i was
[39:03] just ministering on patience
[39:05] down in mullins on thursday night
[39:08] i was ministering on
[39:10] patience amen
[39:12] but we want to talk this morning about
[39:14] perfect love and
[39:16] a little bit of
[39:19] amen
[39:22] some things that
[39:24] god was dealing with us on patients amen
[39:29] perfect love amen
[39:31] and perfect faith this morning
[39:34] we know that love and faith
[39:38] they work together
[39:40] so we got to have perfect if we're going
[39:42] to have perfect faith
[39:44] then we need perfect love
[39:46] so we talk about perfect faith this
[39:48] morning
[39:49] said have faith in god
[39:52] amen in order to have faith in god you
[39:55] must know that he is god
[39:58] are you with me
[40:00] the bible says he that cometh to god
[40:02] must first of all believe that he
[40:05] that he is
[40:07] and that he is the rewarder of them that
[40:10] diligence seek him
[40:13] have faith in god perfect faith
[40:17] brother and sister this morning i was
[40:20] like i was saying in mullins you know
[40:23] the trine of your faith work is patient
[40:27] and we must be patient
[40:31] amen because then your patient possesses
[40:33] your soul
[40:35] and we understand that the bible teaches
[40:38] us the tribulation
[40:40] work is patient
[40:42] so what we go through
[40:44] sometimes god is saying this is how
[40:48] patient can have a perfect word
[40:51] amen
[40:53] so
[40:54] in return
[40:56] god is
[40:58] god's will
[41:00] for us is perfection
[41:04] god will for you and i is perfection
[41:09] now how are we gonna
[41:11] be perfected
[41:14] perfection
[41:16] is
[41:17] patience
[41:20] perfection is patience
[41:26] and patience what it does
[41:30] it develops
[41:32] character are you with me
[41:35] so developing character
[41:38] is what we are dealing with because
[41:41] people amen want that character
[41:45] god is identified by its own
[41:47] characteristics
[41:49] they want character
[41:51] but
[41:52] they don't want
[41:54] to suffer
[41:56] the bible tells us the tribulation work
[41:58] is
[41:59] patience
[42:01] and patient experience and experience
[42:03] hope and hope makers is not ashamed
[42:06] because the love of god is shedded
[42:08] abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
[42:12] are you with me
[42:14] so
[42:14] we understand that we must be patient
[42:18] amen
[42:21] and
[42:22] patient is perfection
[42:25] i mean perfection is patient
[42:28] waiting on god
[42:31] and
[42:32] waiting for god
[42:36] are you with me
[42:37] i'm waiting on you lord
[42:40] amen we're just in a hurry we seem like
[42:43] we got to move before god
[42:47] i can't take it no more i can't stand
[42:49] and i'm uh
[42:51] we get all perplexed in trouble but god
[42:55] is developing character
[42:59] god is taking us to a place where he's
[43:01] trying to get you amen amen where you
[43:04] need to be because god is allowing
[43:07] certain things to happen in your life to
[43:10] bring into a place that you can
[43:12] understand that all things would work
[43:14] together to the good
[43:17] to them to love the lord
[43:20] amen we cannot amen try to bypass amen
[43:24] the things that we go through we're
[43:26] gonna have to take it with patience
[43:30] wait on god
[43:32] and wait for god
[43:35] amen
[43:37] i'm waiting on god and i'm waiting for
[43:39] god the lord to come amen
[43:41] praise god why are you going to have
[43:44] patience away
[43:46] they mean somebody said i'm going to
[43:47] wait till my change come
[43:49] amen you got to have passion to wait
[43:51] till your chains come
[43:53] even when the adversary is coming
[43:55] against you you're going to have to have
[43:56] patience to wait
[43:58] lord i'm waiting on you
[44:00] amen something bound to happen if you
[44:03] have passion
[44:07] praise god how can you have patience
[44:09] when you don't have faith
[44:13] amen when you don't have faith you see
[44:15] if you had faith then you have
[44:17] confidence you can trust
[44:20] you can trust in the god that's able
[44:24] no matter what you're going through i
[44:26] can trust your god
[44:28] because i know you're evil
[44:31] he's more than able
[44:33] to fix it for you amen you got to have
[44:38] it takes perfect faith and perfect faith
[44:41] is a revelation it's got to be revealed
[44:43] to you
[44:44] praise god are you with me
[44:47] perfect faith is based on forgiveness
[44:51] amen
[44:52] perfect faith is based on forgiveness
[44:56] see a lot of folks amen
[44:58] said i got faith in god but they don't
[45:01] amen they don't
[45:02] find themselves knowing how to forgive
[45:06] amen
[45:08] christ forgave us
[45:09] the bible said even when we were enemies
[45:12] in our minds by wicked work
[45:14] christ died for the ungodly
[45:17] are you a man
[45:18] amen we want them so good that amen but
[45:21] if he can forgive us we ought to be able
[45:23] to forgive
[45:27] amen one another amen and forgive amen
[45:31] no matter what the circumstances what
[45:32] the condition is if you want perfect
[45:35] faith it's based off of forgiveness
[45:38] are you
[45:39] but if you can't forgive then your
[45:41] heavenly father what
[45:44] won't forgive you isn't that right
[45:46] so we're talking about perfect faith but
[45:49] we want to say i have faith in god but i
[45:53] will not forgive
[45:57] amen our attitude and how we respond and
[46:00] react to one another is based on whether
[46:04] or not you've forgiven your brother
[46:06] you're forgiving your sister you're
[46:07] forgiven
[46:10] amen
[46:13] praise god
[46:15] you know it's something that somebody
[46:17] spit in your face and put a uh
[46:20] some thorns
[46:23] sticking in your skull and
[46:25] people are wit uh whip you and spit on
[46:28] you and you you could say
[46:32] nail nails in your hand and
[46:35] so forth and yet you can say i forgive
[46:38] you
[46:40] amen you think that's that's a real uh
[46:45] did it really happen
[46:47] amen if jesus did all of that and he
[46:49] took all of that then uh oh
[46:53] some things happen to us a lot of its
[46:55] light afflictions
[46:57] but to have perfect faith and then faith
[47:00] is based off of forgiveness it meant the
[47:03] bible said the captain of our salvation
[47:05] he was faithful
[47:08] amen as until faithful creator
[47:11] amen god was faithful
[47:14] amen praise god
[47:16] jesus was faithful
[47:18] in his service
[47:20] amen
[47:21] praise god and you must be faithful to
[47:24] god
[47:25] and your love for him because his love
[47:28] for us
[47:30] amen it was unconditional love
[47:34] he didn't love us
[47:35] because of what we've done uh how amen
[47:39] praise god how much we loved him but his
[47:42] love was unconditionally
[47:45] praise god so god loved you in spite of
[47:49] amen when we amen did wicked works when
[47:52] we were enemies in our minds and when we
[47:55] did the stuff we did god still died for
[47:59] us he still cared about us he hadn't
[48:02] stopped caring
[48:05] he hasn't stopped loving us
[48:08] he still loves us
[48:11] it's whether or not those that will they
[48:14] may believe that he loves you
[48:17] they may believe that he cares about you
[48:20] believe that he cares amen
[48:23] see some fine folk amen they put on a a
[48:27] false
[48:28] persona
[48:30] they meant sometimes folks don't mean it
[48:32] what they're doing they don't even love
[48:35] god like the altar
[48:38] praise god i tell you brothers and
[48:40] sisters once they meant the love of god
[48:42] is shedded abroad in your heart by the
[48:44] holy ghost amen it takes you to another
[48:47] place
[48:51] now
[48:53] faith is based off of
[48:55] faith i i just we just don't want to
[48:58] have any kind of faith but romans uh 10
[49:03] and 17 romans 10 and 17 says
[49:08] how did
[49:12] you don't want to have just faith in
[49:14] anything you want to have faith in god
[49:18] amen
[49:19] i want to have faith in god faith
[49:22] and god and what he says amen
[49:26] nice says faith cometh by what
[49:30] and hearing what
[49:33] amen
[49:35] so then faith come by hearing and
[49:37] hearing by the word of god
[49:42] i'ma tell you something it's the word of
[49:44] god that i want you to have faith in
[49:46] perfect faith
[49:48] in what god said
[49:50] god said it i can have perfect faith
[49:54] prophet god says you can go into the
[49:57] deeper things
[49:58] he said
[50:00] because of where we're at he said the
[50:01] church has gotten to
[50:03] got to be lifted lift itself
[50:06] in the power of god
[50:09] the church got to lift itself
[50:12] in the power of god
[50:14] and it says how
[50:17] how can the church be lifted in the
[50:19] power of god
[50:23] we're too close to the end how many
[50:25] believe that
[50:27] we're too close to the end now
[50:30] and i believe the church
[50:32] in
[50:34] the condition where we
[50:36] can teach
[50:37] it a little deeper
[50:41] deeper things
[50:43] and rub some of the make belief out
[50:49] rub some of the make believe out
[50:53] i believe we got to rub some of the
[50:55] make-believe out
[50:57] see sometimes we think we believe but we
[51:00] just make believers
[51:02] but we got to rub someone to make them
[51:04] believe
[51:05] out
[51:08] to get into
[51:10] something real
[51:12] you got to get to make believe out to
[51:15] get into something real
[51:18] see because sometimes we can uh just
[51:21] presume
[51:23] we can venture without authority we can
[51:25] just presume that we have it
[51:28] we can have the potential but we don't
[51:31] have
[51:33] the acon is the potential of the oak
[51:35] tree
[51:36] is we have potential there
[51:39] and we're on our way to that but until
[51:42] the oak tree is manifested that we don't
[51:45] have the oak tree as of yet
[51:47] we have the potential we have the econ
[51:51] are you with me
[51:52] brother and sister i'm talking about
[51:54] going somewhere amen into the deeper
[51:58] walk with god by faith
[52:01] amen by faith we ain't we understand
[52:07] that the world were framed by the word
[52:09] of god
[52:11] are you look man
[52:13] see we got to have faith and without
[52:15] faith hebrews
[52:17] 11 6 without faith it's impossible
[52:24] amen
[52:25] impossible the
[52:27] the the please god
[52:30] amen without faith
[52:36] faith
[52:37] is what you know you see
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] do what you know
[52:46] faith is what you know
[52:48] amen what you see
[52:50] is not faith
[52:52] because you see it
[52:55] then it can't be faith
[52:57] because faith is the substance of things
[52:58] hoped for in the evidence to think what
[53:01] but faith is just as real as your sight
[53:08] see because faith is the sixth sense
[53:11] and it's just as real
[53:13] and the bible says faith is the what
[53:16] so faith is a substance amen faith is
[53:20] something that you know you got
[53:23] because it's a real substance it's just
[53:25] as real as your eyes
[53:28] your eyes says that that is light isn't
[53:32] that right
[53:33] now
[53:34] uh
[53:35] you know
[53:36] why amen that somebody tried to talk you
[53:39] out of it and say it's not
[53:42] amen then you said my sight has declined
[53:46] it's light
[53:48] amen
[53:49] then your faith if it's amen perfect
[53:52] faith if it's genuine faith amen then
[53:55] you can declare it
[53:59] and you got faith to back you up
[54:03] hallelujah
[54:05] praise god nobody can talk you out of it
[54:08] that is life why because i see it
[54:12] praise god
[54:15] hallelujah
[54:16] some things you see and you know it's
[54:19] real
[54:20] they meant something you feel and you
[54:23] know it's real
[54:25] amen some things you hear and you know
[54:28] what you heard
[54:30] amen faith has to be something that
[54:33] you're certain of
[54:37] there's no fear and there's no doubt
[54:42] amen
[54:43] perfect faith i'm walking by faith
[54:47] not by sight
[54:49] praise god
[54:51] faith amen is a place where christians
[54:54] live
[54:56] amen faith is a place that god says amen
[55:00] it's the kingdom of god amen cometh not
[55:03] with other
[55:04] vatican jesus said they said lord hear a
[55:08] lord there because the kingdom of god is
[55:11] where
[55:12] it's within you
[55:14] praise god you possess it
[55:18] it's real it's genuine
[55:23] the woman in with the issue of blood she
[55:25] had perfect faith she said if i can but
[55:27] touch
[55:28] the hem of his garment
[55:31] i believe that i'll be made whole
[55:35] her faith says if i can touch it
[55:39] the hymn of his garbage
[55:41] and when she did
[55:43] jesus respond
[55:47] because she had faith
[55:50] praise god
[55:52] her it's your blood was stopped right
[55:55] then
[55:56] why because she believed that she had
[56:00] perfect faith
[56:01] brother sister when you got it like the
[56:03] bible said
[56:07] you're not vengeance you're not
[56:08] presuming you're not vision without
[56:10] authority amen you have something that's
[56:12] genuine
[56:14] amen you got to roll up the unbelief
[56:17] house
[56:18] amen something that you know amen
[56:22] now what happens
[56:24] amen to many people they think they have
[56:27] what they don't have
[56:29] amen
[56:30] uh uh uh
[56:32] it's something to have
[56:34] a gun and you got the shells and
[56:36] everything there
[56:41] everything is that you have you know
[56:44] what
[56:45] the bullet can do the
[56:48] ballistics of it
[56:50] the power in the shell the powder
[56:54] you know what it can do you got it
[56:57] amen
[56:59] but until
[57:01] you fire
[57:05] amen
[57:06] then it's just down line dominate
[57:09] but once the fire get hold to the powder
[57:12] and blast it off amen then you see the
[57:14] power of it
[57:17] the it's in your hand it's got the power
[57:19] to do it amen but the f it's got to take
[57:22] faith to put it in action
[57:25] amen the disciples had power god gave
[57:28] them power but they didn't have faith to
[57:31] operate the power
[57:34] are you up man
[57:36] god gives you an eye the holy ghost's
[57:38] power
[57:40] but we got to have faith to operate that
[57:43] power
[57:45] the power of god is within you
[57:49] greater is he that's in you than he that
[57:52] is in the world
[57:54] are you with me
[57:56] but you got to have faith to release and
[57:59] activate the power
[58:03] it's something about jesus was with them
[58:06] and they couldn't cast the devil out of
[58:08] the
[58:09] man that was
[58:11] gassing himself down and tearing himself
[58:14] and casting himself in the fire father
[58:16] brought him to jesus said jesus can you
[58:18] help me
[58:20] amen he said
[58:22] if you
[58:24] if you can he said if you can believe
[58:26] then all things are what
[58:28] possibly isn't that right
[58:31] god knew what he jesus knew who he was
[58:33] he knew he was the word and he knew who
[58:36] he was as being the word he knew he had
[58:39] power and authority over the devil
[58:43] are you up man
[58:45] so jesus amen activated what he had
[58:50] praise god hallelujah
[58:53] he commanded that spirit and the spirit
[58:56] had to come out
[58:59] are you with me
[59:01] because jesus knew who he was
[59:04] and you as a believer got to know who
[59:07] you are
[59:10] and once you recognize and i am a
[59:12] believer then you have a right to say
[59:15] amen because i'm a believer the sign
[59:18] shall follow the believer
[59:21] the believer is not following signs but
[59:24] amen the signs follow the believers
[59:28] amen you got a lot of people that are
[59:30] looking and falling out if this prophet
[59:33] came to town this man came to die in
[59:35] this group that group people people
[59:37] joined groups
[59:40] they get with a certain man this man and
[59:42] that man and this group of people this
[59:45] organization not and they trust in that
[59:48] but genuine faith
[59:50] praise god amen
[59:53] some people identify themselves as a
[59:55] group as they identify themselves with a
[59:58] name or with the man or whatever
[1:00:01] but real genuine faith
[1:00:05] praise god i'm talking about perfect
[1:00:07] faith
[1:00:09] amen praise god christ was with him and
[1:00:13] but he said oh
[1:00:15] lord why can't he said this kind come
[1:00:17] about faster than praying
[1:00:19] amen christ was whacked him
[1:00:22] oh but things changed
[1:00:25] the one that's what him got in them
[1:00:30] things changed then
[1:00:32] amen he's just not with us but he's in
[1:00:35] us
[1:00:37] makes the difference brother
[1:00:40] they meant some church some folk got
[1:00:42] amen christ with him but they don't have
[1:00:44] christ in them
[1:00:46] amen i want christ amen once he's in you
[1:00:50] then you have the confidence
[1:00:53] amen the holy ghost in you amen
[1:00:56] that woman amen she didn't confess the
[1:00:58] holy ghost she just had perfect faith
[1:01:02] amen but it's difficult it's a little
[1:01:03] harder they meant to have perfect faith
[1:01:06] when you don't have the holy ghost in
