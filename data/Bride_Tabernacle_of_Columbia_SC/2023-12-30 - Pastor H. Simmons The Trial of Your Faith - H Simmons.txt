Peter the first chapter it says Peter on a Apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered of throughout uh ponus Galia capid doia AIA and penia elect according to the full knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit and to Obedience of the sprinkling of the blood Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiply blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again un a lively hope excuse me according to the Abundant Mercy has he begotten us again into a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time when you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaveness through manifold Temptation that the trial of your faith be much more precious than of gold that perish though it be tried with fire might be found into praise and honor and Glory at the appearance of Jesus Christ God bless your this word you may be seated we want talk about the trial the trial of your faith praise God you know I was just thinking about this chapter and I was reading and and I said you know I wonder when Peter was writing this these gracious words to the saints of God to encourage them and to admonish them and tell them that you you you the testing of your faith the trial of your faith you it's more precious than gold and uh though it be tried with fire you going to go through some things but it was so many gracious words that he was saying to them to encourage them he he said elect according amen until the full knowledge of God so I'm speaking to you and putting you in your position that you understand who you are amen so when I talk about the trial of your faith amen the testes that we're going to go through or that we are going to and I thought about these words that were put to pen back then and I thought about how the message of the hour restores us back to the faith of the apostolic fathers that the faith your faith that has been restored amen you and I understand that the trial of our faith amen he said the trial in the seventh verse that the trial of your faith being much more what precious precious then go praise God what you going through present tense what as a Christian as a Believer as fellow fellow citizens of the Kingdom amen I want you to understand that God is you know uh uh saying that the trial of your faith that you can hold on I want you to hold on and I want you to understand that what you going through praise God is precious as a Believer as one that holding to the word that God has given us in this hour this end time it's more precious than gold but see sometimes folks don't understand the why they being tested or why they being tried amen how precious is it is and then what happens when you're tested once you're tried gold perishes though it be tried with fire it might be found unto the praise and honor amen we saw uh those Believers in the old test men and the Believers in the early church and what they went through you know you know how the women were uh children were ripped out of the stomach to cut John hust say went and they burnt him at the state and different Believers amen they had to go through things because their faith was tried but what happened they held on stepen was stoned to death and he looked into heaven he said I see Jesus at the right hand of God he said don't lay this on their charge amen why because it's what oh what happens amen a Believer amen When Trials and test has come then we must embrace them we must welcome it so Lord thank you for counting me worthy yes to suffer for your name yes amen and that's what happens uh amen the apostles when they beat him and throw him in jail they were singing Paul inside of singing amen thank you Lord because I'm doing this amen and and I thank God because he chose me he said elect according to the full knowledge of God he chose me for this thank you Jesus brother and sister you not just coming to church you've been chosen you've been chosen you are the elect of God and God forne you before the foundation of the world Amen it's a joy to be in the house of the Lord It's a joy to serve God amen amen praise God yes so when we come we say Lord thank you yes amen because amen God according to the full knowledge uhhuh elect he said elect remember that you were picked out you were chosen amen not because we were so good it's because of his love towards us his Mercy towards us so let's go back and pick it up in the second verse elect according to the full knowledge of God the father right through the sanctification of the spirit until obedience and sprinkl of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you he said Grace unto you if you can understand and receive it as a a personal that God is speaking to me amen he's talking to me he said Grace unto you and peace not only as I said to Mullins last night not only is he saying peace but he said Peace be are you with me God is Not only saying peace but he said I want peace to be multiplied amen yes your peace to be multiply amen I got a little excited when I was just I mean things just begin to Spring off the pages amen it means something because I'm the elect amen according to the full knowledge of God Amen he says here blessed be the third verse blessed be God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ according to his what see he he just don't don't have he just didn't have mercy on us but his Mercy to us is abundant amen it's a oh amen hallelujah hallelujah the thief come to kill steal and destroy but I'm I came that you might have life and that you might have it what more more abundant amen God his grace is abundant amen amen I I thank God for it his Mercy abundant Mercy has what has begotten who I I mean you this thing is personal he's begotten you know me who is he talking to he's talking to who he's talking to me me are you with me I said he's talking to me and it means something to me brother friend Hallelujah and when when it means something to you it goes a little deeper praise God you know when he says this letter is unto you amen so you can read between the lines amen praise God so some folks who just read it like he's talking to somebody 2,000 years ago but he's talking to me now amen this is not 2,000 years or so ago and Peter's talking to somebody back there he's talking to me now praise God the Bible say Jesus Christ is same yesterday and what and today and forever and Jesus is the word praise God and this present tense word for our day amen you know sometimes we we make uh the message of the hour some other material instead of the message of the hour being the Bible praise God Jesus message for the hour was what they had already and he took out of the book of Isaiah and he read praise God and it was the message of the hour when he read it was the message of the hour he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me you know the prophet of God was talking about in the veiling of God he was talking about the manifested word for the hour the The Living Word of the hour are you with me see when the word is manifested the word is made flesh are you with me in you and I then it comes off the pages it ain't me reading some quotes it's the word mean manifested you and I as living Epistles written and read of all men the word manifest The Living Word and the prophet of God said if the the word is living God will vindicate his word amen there's Miracle signs and healings and oh God the supernatural God manifesting himself in the midst of his people because the word is a living and what the word oh goodness what the word did in Jesus Christ it'll do in you and if it's not doing it amen then it must not be the word praise me amen but if it's a Living Word then that word word would manifest itself amen when the word was living amen when Moses amen became the word of the hour amen God began to manifest miracles signs and wonders because he was the word manifested praise God and Joshua amen when he amen when the word was manifested in Joshua when Moses stepped out the scene Joshua went cross Jordan because the word was living it wasn't I'm what Moses said yeah I'mma do what Moses said amen praise God nothing wrong with quot nothing wrong with that but it it's another level Amen to manifest it am amen everybody talking about manifestation and everybody talking about the Living Word but everybody can't produce what they saying yes amen oh Hallelujah folks can amen they can tell you all about it praise God no doubt they were telling all about amen how the Red Sea opened and how this and that happened but Jesus stepped on the scene and he said lat come forth something happened amen he done things and no never we heard a man speak like this man I'm saying amen you as individuals not amen just a fivefold Ministry amen you as individual amen got to manifest a Living Word and be written of principles R of all men God is writing a Bible through you amen praise God and one day praise God you you being R now amen how you live how you walk you've been read even when the children of Elder did bad it was red even when the Corinthian Church was doing bad they was red amen the good in the bad was red praise God but through all your trials through all your tests you still I can still see him addressing you as elect according to the full knowledge of God God knew everything that you would go through every problem that you would have yes every sickness that you would have yes amen God knew every Temptation and trial that you would have yes and God knew amen praise God that you would make it through he knew you would make it througho why because you were elect according to the full knowledge of God you were a part of God's thinking how do you know that amen you were a gene thought in the mind of God Amen you were part of his thinking amen now you the word manifested for the hour you live in are you with me you are the manifested word for the hour praise God I understand who I am I'm not just a church go I'm not just a message believer I am the manifested word of the hour I expect to see God not in somebody else I expect to see Jesus in me yes L what about you yes I expect to see Jesus in me yes praise God so he said the works that I do you'll do also and Greater Works than need shall you because I go to my father isn't that right so amen you ought to Expect Miracles expect signs and wonders amen somebody said I'm a walking Miracle amen amen I am a miracle amen God Christ in you the hope of glory oh yes I got to it's it's exciting that this Bible becomes the present tense word of the hour are you with me forever age they could look in there and get what was written to them in every age and in the thara age amen what they were going through amen Columbus amen called a revelation amen he may not as fully amen understood that praise God but by Revelation he the spirit of God knew what was called for in that age praise God and when Luther came on the scene amen it was a call amen the Deep call to the deep and the just shall live by faith praise God and the Sheep of that hour heard his voice amen they saw amen he that had an ear

want to thank God for letting me be able to have the strength to go to a whole another state to go to college walk on the campus enjoy myself and then make the decision come back um I thank God for healing me and for keeping my family strong through that and I pray that if the New Year comes that he continues to keep everybody I love and [Applause] now um I want thank God for actually dealing with me cuz my mindset used to be like he wouldn't ever do anything with me but um he dealt with me I'm going say game night cuz we were singing stuff and um I'm I like danced in the spirit cuz I had blacked out and I found myself on the floor so um I'm just thankful that God was able to touch me and actually use me in some sort of way cuz I cuz I had previously thought that he wouldn't so that's [Applause] good see I I know we going to have might have a lot of people here on New Year's night so that's why I was trying to get some Praises out the way now okay well I definitely want to thank the lord for keeping me and my family all year and for being a provider um today I did go to urgent care and I don't know if I told anybody cuz you know I don't like to talk about things negative or things that's going on with me but I have been dealing with a illness or what have you um in my body and they don't exactly know what it is but I did have to go um to urgent care today but um in my right hand um it just was getting progressively worse where I didn't have a lot of movement in it in the wrist and it was painful so I said you know I'm just going to go to urgent care you know get some prednizone or whatever but anyway the doctors want me to go to a rheumatologist next month and I really hadn't been talking about it because I'm you know I've already claimed my healing and I was telling somebody else you know things get worse a lot of times before they get better in your healing so I don't want to look at the symptoms or anything so I am claiming my healing I am going to go to the doctor though um in January I'm I'm going to go through with it um but I just want to thank the Lord for that but I did have something on my heart and I know we may take communion you know New Year's Eve and I said I want to get this off of me before communion uh I don't know if it was last Sunday or the Sunday before after church Hannah had came to me and she said Ma you know it was one day that she said they're having a game night and I'm not invited I said well I mean it's not the first time I've heard that Hannah you know it's okay and she said I just don't see why I can't go why am I not old enough what are they doing drinking it was a joke I said I don't know I don't I don't know but the thing is it bothered me it bothered me um and I talked to Maya about it and I talked to one of my friends about it I said well you know what I got to get this off of me it's not geared my frustration it's not geared to anyone specifically but I just feel some type of way and I'm just being honest I feel some type of way about it um so I wanted to get get that off of me cuz I don't want to take it into 2024 so you know I just wanted to say that but I love everybody but that just has really been bothering me so that's all I want to say y'all just continue to keep us in your prayers and I love everybody amen I just want to thank the Lord throughout this year for keeping everybody that has been going through this year um I don't want to take anything into 2024 either so I would like to say that um we cut off the age for game night for our little for our little group because we didn't want I hate to say this but we just didn't want a certain we didn't want anybody to feel uncomfortable we were planning to have a little game night for the kids but we hadn't come up with every with the whole thing yet but we were going to plan to do that and we did not I feel bad for if anybody felt excluded but there was an age limit this year due to certain people being invited
