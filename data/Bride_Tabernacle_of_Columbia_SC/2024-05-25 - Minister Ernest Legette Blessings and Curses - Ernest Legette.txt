that Lord just pray God that You' continue keeping your people continue watching over your children God and blessing us in a mighty way father for we love you we appreciate you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of ma Malachi by the grace of God Malachi 3 try not to be long tonight amen Malachi 3 you got to say amen and it reads we'll start here at the seventh verse and it reads even from the days of your father ye are going away from my in ordinance and have not kept them return unto unto me and I will return unto you sayeth the Lord of hosts but ye have but ye said wherein shall we return will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offering you may be seated read a little further down he says Where have you robbed where wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive to receive it and I will rebuke the devour for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field sayeth the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delight delightsome land sayth the Lord of hosts your words have been Stout against me say the Lord yet ye say what have we spoken so much against thee ye have said it is vain to serve God and what prophet is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy yay they that work wickedness are set up yay they that tempt God are even delivered then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine sayth the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth not may God had a blessing reading of his word tonight just for a moment I want to minister on a little topic and I entitled it blessings and cursings a and curses amen blessings and curses you know you look you know everybody in their lifetime desires to be blessed right but God and God wants to bless you God wants to bless each and every one of us right so he gives us ways you know I mean he gives us a room he makes room to bless us but a lot of times we we don't be blessed a lot of lot of times people fall on the cursed side but it's because of their own accord it's not because God desires to do that but they finds themselves out of the program of what God wants right so I says you know what is a blessing you know a blessing when you talking about blessings you talking about God's Divine favor over your life talking about you know God's Divine favor and protection over you that's what when we we look at blessings that's what we're looking at I'm when you say I'm blessed I mean I'm looking at it as God's I've got God's Divine favor amen hallelujah not only his favor but his protection as well that's right you say how how how you know you blessed I'm blessed because God says I'm blessed amen see circumstances don't determine how where God going to B how God going to bless you or if God is going to bless you only thing that's going to determine that is the life that you live amen if you still walk in and living faithful before God no matter where you are no matter what situation you might find yourself in you'll be blessed in it amen amen because God says you blessed amen you know we got so many uh characters in the Bible that we can look at but I was thinking about you know uh for one Joseph no matter where he went he was blessed people hated him they wanted to curse him but you can't curse what God bless can you and and in even in those situations those time times maybe in those hard times when he was in that pit after his brothers uhh throw him in there then he got sold but you know he never lost his faith uh Faith with God he never lost his stance and uh that I'm here and I'm done unjustly but I believe his life was still pleasing unto God so no matter where he went he could still be blessed because of the life his life was pleasing unto God amen amen you know I was I was praying the other day and I was saying Lord that's what I want I says you know I want to walk with you like Enoch walk with you Enoch walk with God and it ple Enoch Enoch's life is very life is walk please God and I said Lord let that I want I want my walk my life my thoughts everything praying always God I want to be pleasing in your sight am you know one thing I've been praying for I says Lord I want I want wisdom above all I was saying you know you know we know that the bride need discernment but wisdom and discernment work together I says Lord I I want more I want wisdom on on how to handle every situation amen amen you know and and the Lord I was I was sitting there praying the other morning and I was praying I as my prayer every day God I want wisdom I know situations going to happen today I know things are going to take place and God I don't want to react how I feel or how I think that I should react in that moment that's right amen I don't want to take advice from somebody and it might sound so good but it be the wrong advice amen this is what you ought to do or this is how you ought to handle that situation and sometimes you know it might sound so good and it might seem like you ought to handle it that way but I says Lord I want your wisdom I want your mind I want your mind on this on every situation you they brought that woman to Jesus it says uh uh we caught her in the act this is what you going to do according to the law they knew what was supposed to happen right not only to her but the man but he didn't react that way what his reaction was was he among you without sin Let Him cast the first stone right come on somebody say well you know you Jes that was Jesus but I says the thing is at some places he reacted he he he acted that way and some places he reacted a different way but nevertheless I says God I don't want to just do what I feel is right or at the time but let me be led by your Holy Spirit God Amen that's my desire in all things because you know you can act wrong or you can say the wrong make the wrong advice get the wrong advice or make the wrong decision at a certain time and you can't go back and correct it amen or you could say the wrong thing give somebody the wrong advice you can't go back and change it it could be damaging to someone's life amen especially to of a person for people in power making decisions that's the wrong decisions it can be damaging in someone's life so you say God I want to be I want to live so close to you that I I just know what your mind is I know what your next what the next move is I know what the next move is you want for me God show and I believe that God can do that God is still working in Supernatural ways still showing visions and dreams and all these things to come that that's that that's up ahead but when you know you got to be spiritual minding you got to be in a place where God can show you but when it comes to you you got to you got to allow God to use you in that in that place amen come on I believe that with all of my heart but I says that that's what it is you know I've been praying in that way but I says everybody desires to be blessed right so we looking here at you know how the prophet prophesying and he was saying you know he was talking to that Nation he was saying uh he was saying you know will a man rob God a lot of times you know uh uh uh we know that this scripture might be widely used to uh uh get the people to uh give up all that money that's in the churches and stuff but nevertheless it's the Bible anyway he says you ought to pay your ties right because that's God's way and if you don't then you cursed you cursed with a what curse people say well no come on it's the it's the program of God reason why you don't pay your ti or you don't don't give your offering because you don't trust God you don't believe that God will bless you but what he says to you and I tonight and you know we don't preach money but what he says to you and I tonight prove me come on try me God is waiting to bless somebody yes sir amen God is waiting to open up the windows of Heaven for somebody but he says I want you to step out on faith and try me amen prove me and see what do you know a lot of times when we looking at blessings we thinking about money finances or we thinking about big houses cars that drive and all that but blessings sometimes can be just waking up in the morning feeling all right blessings come on could be that car wreck that God allowed a hedge to be around you and didn't allow a happen blessings come on Amen you know yesterday my my son Moses running into somebody mailbox with my wife car they sent the text and I saw the picture soon as I saw it it was late last night cuz I had to work over you know what all the boys at work said Ernest you better not be mad he says first thing you need to find out is is he hurt and if he ain't hurt you better be glad because he could have got hurt in an accident you know we start looking at things a little bit different right because I says God I'm must say God I've been praying Lord I need wisdom it's a lot of things since I've been praying that way took place and God wants you to respond or act in a certain way and I wouldn't want to do it but the Lord said I'm trying to give you what you asked for come on whatever you ask for God want to give it to you things it's character in your life God want to get out of you right but you can't tell God how to give it to you amen amen and you can't tell God how to teach you certain lessons come on God's got his own way and his way is sure he knows how to get the job done when he gets done teaching you you'll understand I believe that come on you know I stir me up the other day I was reading in the scriptures and how you know Jesus sat down with the at Matthews I believe Matthew house and all those and but the Pharisees and the scribes came up to his disciples and says why your master eating with Sinners and stuff but Jesus the Bible says Jesus heard him and he says unto them he says won't you go and learn what it means that I I I desire Hallelujah mercy and not sacrifice he said go learn what that mean come on he was talking to the preachers of that day wasn't he he was talking to the church Church of that day go learn what that mean come on ye that know the Bible ye that have learned come on he says that I was sent to to the sick not the whole come on to the called the Sinners to the repentance not the righteous I believe God is still saving Souls today sometimes we got to go and learn what the scriptures mean come on cuz we can take our own interpretation and all those things men can teach it a certain way but the Holy Ghost got to teach you what the scriptures mean Hallelujah other than that youve been taught by men but he says that you are no man to teach you the Holy Ghost when he come he'll teach you all things that's why you got to have a relationship with God not with the church not with the pastor not with the preacher that's all right but you got to have a relationship with God where you can get down on your knees in commune with him Lord what do you want on my life amen God what do you say to me God what that you trying to teach me that's what I want Hallelujah but that comes with a personal relationship and it's nothing like having that person relationship why because when you in trouble you know you got a friend you can run to you know what God what the voice of God is like because you talk to him every day hallelujah oh Jesus come on he says I'll bless you right come on so we says blessings ain't always just looking at money and houses and all those things but it's a lot of ways God blessing you right come on a lot of times we says we ain't blessed we curse because we curse ourselves come on you bring things on yourself a lot of times right you know I was looking over the scriptures and how he says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy sometimes we don't get Mercy like we ought to from God but you need to examine your life amen hallelujah oh Jesus come on one thing he says that you ought to treat others as you would ought to be as you want to be treated right as you want others to treat you right you know one day I was laying on the couch and it came to me so clear I'll never forget a little voice came to me so clear this was years ago now he says to me you won't be judged on how how others treated you but you will be judged on how you treated others right amen come on when you come before God you can't have an account to say Lord I did this because of look at how they done me this is the why I reacted the way I reacted come on I don't believe you can go to God like that because there nobody can't treat you no worse than what they treated him come on and how did he react father forgive them for they know not what they do he reacted with love didn't he love in such a way that it was power love in such a way that something came out of that didn't it Hallelujah but that can't be uh uh imitated you can't make that up that's something that God got to give you oh no that's something that he got to do in your life come on and a lot of times it comes through trials and tribulations Hallelujah you beat down you talked about you walked over you looked over come on time and time again come on oh Jesus but God meant it for you good amen so you can walk humbly before him Hallelujah I thank God for the lessons that he teaches us how many thank God for that tonight Hallelujah but we fine I says come on blesses and curse God want to bless you tonight don't he come on I thank God I said Lord I want to be on the blessing side amen come on I want to be on a on on a side that's blessed don't you know God's Got so many blessings that he want to give out come on I thank God for all all the things you know I was looking at uh uh some of the you know looking at the scriptures and how you know here you know Malachi was going over telling them to try he he was saying uh prove me all but then he begins to say say here in the in the 11th verse I like this this in 11th verse he says and I will rebuke the devour for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast the fruit before the time in the in the field sayth the Lords of hosts when God bless you the devil can't take it away come on when God bless you I like how he says I'll bless the fruit of your ground I'll rebuke the devour for your sake amen come on when God is blessing the Devil can't do nothing with it am he'll rebuke them for your sake fruits coming up just like the midianites used to take them away from to Israel all the time but it came a time where God was going to put a stop to it come on Hallelujah God bless you don't worry about it His blessings don't add no Sorrows to it come on what happen when you bless yourself men come take it steal it don't they bring your sorrow heartache and pain but when God blesses you Hallelujah I'll rebuke the devour for your sake oh Jesus come on he'll protect the vine amen God can do it I'm not worried about it God can do it and he promised that he would that's the thing about it he promised that he would that's my Assurance Lord you promis God this is what you said Hallelujah and I'm standing on it oh Jesus come on Hallelujah you know you praying I said Lord this is what you said one thing about it God's word is solid come on it's firm it's a foundation that can't be moved When God says it that then you don't like it says God says as I believe it that settles it but God said it that settles it whether you believe it or not it's true anyhow oh Jesus I was in prayer the other day I said that's one thing about God I thank you for your word it can't be moved amen hallelujah amen ships uh uh uh uh I mean the wind and the wavs all those things but God word Can't Be Moved it's solid it's firm Hallelujah it'll answer every time it'll answer the call every time in the Midnight Hour it'll answer the call early in the morning it'll answer the call oh Jesus and I believe it will come on but he says I'll bless him I I he said I I'll rebuke him for your sake you know one thing they were saying here in the scriptures and the thing is a lot of times you don't say things from your mouth but your actions what your spirit is saying God hears it and that's what he's saying he's saying you uh uh you saying it's vain to Worship the Lord thy God they said when we say that God saw your actions come on they were saying at that time it was vain to worship God why they were looking sometime times that Lord we we doing what we supposed to do we paying our ties we living right we doing and we ain't blessed come on God need to open your eyes and see how blessed you are but they thought it was vain to worship God didn't they they begin to say within themselves look at the wicked and the proud and all those things come on but God said that he heard the righteous now come on he heard them that fear the lord talking to one another Hallelujah then he got him a book out over and he said he was going to write in it a book of remembrance of when the squeeze come Hallelujah I believe that just adding that come on when the trials came I I'm a remember who stayed faithful Hallelujah come on when the storms come I'mma remember who still feared the Lord come on when they were put to the test I'm going remember that Hallelujah and I'm making up Jewels oh Jesus you wait to the end and he said then you discern whether it was right to serve the Lord or not come on oh Jesus ain't that what he said that's stir me up here in the in the in the in the 18th verse he says then shall ye return He was talking about in the end in the 18th verse he says then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked come on because they were saying within themselves it's vain to serve the Lord Lord how many times we see that come on especially in the young people right say oh they out there and ain't nothing happen to them and we just bored all these things come on we can't do nothing all these things that the devil brings to your mind come on but in the end Hallelujah you and I that's live long enough to see what the end is like come on now we can discern between the righteous and the wicked and I can tell you that it wasn't vain to serve the Lord hallelujah I can tell you that was the best decision I ever made I could tell you it saved me from a lot of heartache and pain come on Amen oh Jesus it's not vain to serve the Lord amen come on I'll choose God any day Hallelujah if I had to do it all over again I'll choose him again amen amen why because it's good to serve the Lord amen he's been nothing but good to me Hallelujah come on now discern right you know one thing we were looking at at work the other day I mean not looking at but we was talking at work a boy that I grew up with and uh me and them were classmates and all but we were sitting out talking and he was telling uh uh some of the boys at work he just talking about how I was growing up and especially in high school talking about some of the stuff I got I was involved in and things and everybody especially one of God he said man I can't believe that I I don't I don't even believe that he said Ernest used to tell us certain things but I can't even I can't honestly never ever see him or believe him ever doing nothing like that right but the other guys like hey we could never ever see him or believe in him talking about uh uh getting saved let alone being a preacher come on but as they were talking about especially the guy was saying I just don't believe Ernest would ever I can't never ever imagine him doing that in my spirit was rejoicing you know why I said that's a Testament of the power of God Amen Hallelujah am that's a testament come on that being born again ain't just coming to church and giving you a right hand of Fellowship amen but it's actually a life change the old man is dead you put on a new man Hallelujah and those that didn't know you before they can't believe it why cuz it's a Testament of the power of God my soul was rejoicing thinking about that I said God thank you you don't have to tell the change people see the change amen oh Jesus come on Hallelujah that's a Testament of the power of God ain't it come on when people people look at your life they ought to know something has changed amen come on they ought to know that you're a Christian right they ought to know that's something different about you than everybody else amen and it ain't you and your just because of your flesh but it's because of the presence that you giving off and that don't come from yourself but that come from God his Spirit the Holy Ghost amen going with you on the job Hallelujah going with you everywhere you go amen and I thank God for that Hallelujah cuz I need him everywhere I go how many need him tonight oh Jesus but I said that's a testament ain't it come on that it ain't vain to serve the Lord as it were going we were talking about certain things and all the tragedies I said it it was not vain to serve the Lord not one day come on but we get so I says I've been blessed and I'm still being blessed right now come on God is so good to us you know one thing this this older guy he's 60 something years old 66 years old older one Caucasian white guys at the job he says man he says ever since I told Ernest that I didn't believe in God he been trying to um uh uh baptized me ever since says man I told him I says I I call I say Bruce that's his name maybe he'll listen I said man you broke my heart when you told me you didn't believe in God you know after the testimonies that you told me don't you know that was God that got you out of that don't you know that it was God that saw you through it that wasn't just chance that was God that done that and it say you don't believe in him right but he told me he says Earnest but I tell you one thing he says even if there isn't a even if there isn't a God he says being a have living a Christian Life is the Better Life to Live anyway he told me that he says because you don't have to deal with a lot of stuff he says even if there ain't a God or a heaven he said living going to church and living right would be the better life to live anyway am I thought that was something come on and that wasn't rehearsed but he he said that I thought that was something amen because it's the truth ain't it a man that say he don't believe in God will tell you that's a better life why because he saw the beginning and the end
