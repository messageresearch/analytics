ain't like you oh God that just got us out of the way I pray God that you would forgive us tonight oh Lord you would help us to be reconciled to you and Lord that you might have your way and I miss bless us God in a mighty way touch move save and deliver God we pray by the power of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Psalms 15 by grace of God won't be long tonight amen God is good amen so glad to be in that number one more time amen Psalms 15 and 1. you gotta say Amen and it reads Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that walketh upright uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart you may be seated we'll read a little further down he that backbite of not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor and whose eyes a vowed person is contempt but he honoreth them that fear the lord he that swerveth to it to his own hurt and change if not he that putth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved may God have blessed children of his word amen tonight by the grace of God we want to just speak to you for a moment on who shall abide amen on who shall abide I just want to forget the before I forget uh sisters whoever wanted me to thank the church for praying we had she asked to put a brother on the prayer list and the family was all afraid they thought he might have had cancer and but she said the other day when they went in to do the surgery or whatever it was it wasn't cancer at all so they was thanking the lord for that she says that they praise God all in the doctor's office so we thank God for that amen and God is still real isn't he so you know those prayers they mean a whole lot amen just to call that name or to call them in prayer God heard didn't he and I thank God tonight you think about saying oh you know God God he hears all in just the smallest things you know uh or sometimes we think but take it for granted if God won't move or God move his hand you know it'll be a lot worse than what it was is ain't it or it could be the other way so we always thank God thank God for watching over and keeping and and blessing us you know I was sharing with the the church the other week and how you know I says that what I do all the time especially if I'm not with the family and as soon as I hear them coming in the garage and I hear all of them come in the house within myself I start thanking God and praising God I says because I always say Lord thank you for allowing every one of us to make it back home tonight and and in the same way that we left out you know not coming back with or hurt harm or danger or got all our Limbs and all that every time we cross the threshold I always say Lord thank you because somebody left home and didn't return somebody a family member left and they didn't all come back but God is I said Lord you blessed us and I want to show you that I appreciate it and I tell the Lord thank you so that's important just like we always say is he allowed us to come together one more time you know we didn't do it on our own but God allowed us to be here tonight sometimes people say I just felt like coming you might have did but God allowed you to get here it was a wreck on the road on the way coming up here but yet God allowed us to be here so we ought to be thankful you know it humbles us in a way all the time we see the things that are happening in the world and and and just even in your hometown your heart goes out just because of the things that's happening and and you know tearing up you see your friends you see uh your um friend's children and all and all that lives being destroyed and things happening it burdens your heart even feel that way when you when you see uh them in that kind of condition I said Lord you know what what what is it going to take you know to change the world but you know it what it is God got to have mercy it it always says you know especially the older Saints they always say is this a Praying time but you find yourself saying that all the time now that it's a what it's a Praying time because sometimes you don't know what's going to happen next but I know one thing that God's got it all in control doesn't it tonight by the grace of God so we're gonna be it for you long I just want to minister on who shall who shall Abide a little something that the Lord put on our heart I I just kind of you know uh was looking at this as a little devotion the other day and you know what David had a question you know it says you know who shall abide you know he's talking about remain understand you know in God's Tabernacle you know where God is I said tonight you know I don't know about you but I want to be where God is all the time it's it's not it's not even safe to not be where God is right now you know and where God is he's more than just in church right here tonight but he's going to be with you tomorrow and he's with you the next day and the next day and so on I said God I always want to be with you you know and he says you know Lord who shall abide so then David began to talk about uh uh things of life you know a lot of times we can get into deep things in the in the in the word and all those things which God give us things to us for a reason but it's the things uh that God gives us to govern Our Lives by to help us you know from day to day I was thinking about that you know who shall abide you know Jesus said I think it was a Saint John 15 he was saying that if you abide in me and my word abide in you he said then you can ask what you will come on and I think about that you know that with certainty if you abide in him come on remain stand if you stand his word he said then you can ask what you will and one thing about God God isn't alive come on God can keep it just like what he said he said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you can ask what you will and I said Lord it ain't that I'm asking because I got wants or I want to abide in you because I got wants but Lord I got needs that I need you I got needs that I need you to supply that I need you to to do in my life God that's why I want to abide because I got needs and he said he'll supply all your needs come on whether you're young or whether you're old he said I'll Supply what all of your needs according to his what riches in glory and you know we hold God to that that Lord you promised you said this is what you said come on you know I was thinking I was when I was looking at this like who's saying about who shall abide I says you know a lot of times you you know you look at and I'll skip down a little bit I said you know a lot of times we God put us on a path you know and what gets us off of that path a lot of time is because we don't take heed to what the inner voice is saying a lot of times you can call it conscience or whatever you want to call it but you know it's especially when the Holy Spirit comes it's an inner voice that comes with it is something that that that's with you all the time that that's guiding you or or telling you to take heed to this or take heed to that but many of times you know uh what happens is we don't heed that inner voice many times uh the people would have listened to that inner voice they wouldn't have ended up in the way they were they wouldn't ended up in the shape they were a lot of times people always says you know before a person leave here they already know something already worn them you know Warren always come before judgment come on that inner voice but a lot of times we ride right past that inner voice don't we I had experiences twice this week you know I was I was I was doing something and you know at work and and I was just reaching out for something and but something on the inside said leave that alone get away from that leave that leave that and I heard I heard the word greed something said greed leave that alone but I began to say what it is you can you can override that inner voice or you can take heed because God began to speak to me and says you know as he did David he give him anything he want if that wasn't enough he'd gave him more right but he says that we got a lot of times you know just us thinking about that a lot of times we ain't satisfied with what God gives us we ain't satisfied with what God laid before us we want more but don't you know God knows what's best for you don't you know what God God gives you is the best come on but we don't sometimes we want more we reach out for more and that's where the trouble comes in you know that's where the eve eve thought that you know what God gave she had the tree of life but she wanted more didn't she and what happened you know and listen to the enemy yeah I know what God gave you but you know it's it's a little more that he holding from you I said Lord I thank God for every I thank you for everything you give me I thank you for the little I have the much whatever you give me God I'm satisfied with it I'm content with whatever you give me God because I don't deserve to have none of it anyway I ain't even worthy to have no no you're talking about these materialistic things that one day will be burned in the fire one day be going away that ain't the things we rejoicing in but what we're rejoicing in is that God I thank you one day you came down and you did something in my life you pick me up from where I was and you saved my soul that's what I'm thankful for I was telling Charlotte the other night uh the last night I think it was I said you know us coming up and I was just telling her this last night I said some of the places that I hung out at I knew even then back then that anything could happen at any time you had to worry about your friends you had to worry about your enemies you had to worry about everybody at any time anything gonna happen at any time but yet you still was crazy enough to go in those places why because your flesh desire your flesh overrode what you knew was was natural and made sense and made you go into those places but even in your transgression even in that God still had mercy on you in that when you were a lost or wretch without God he still had mercy on you so you look back at those times and you say God I thank you for keeping me back then and you know what I says that what it is a lot of times we look at some God might be quick to judge or go ahead and judgment why because sometimes he know they won't repent he know that they ain't gonna do right come on God be the judge but I says but yet he looks at us sometimes and he says that even though he's wrong I know that in his heart come on one day you know in his heart he want to do right so God what's in your heart or speak sometime you believe that tonight but I say is that what it is we find that I says that that inner voice we bypass it a lot of time don't we we bypass that inner voice come on I says but to listen to it you know I was sharing with somebody at work the other day they was talking about something and I asked them I said hey why don't you just pray about it won't you just ask God about it they told me Earnest I don't want to ask God about this and he said it kind of jokingly I said but you know what happens a lot of people that's the way they think that's the way they are they don't ask God about certain things they don't want to ask God because of one of two things they're afraid that his answer gonna be against what they desire oh they already know what's wrong so they ain't gonna they ain't gonna pray they ain't gonna ask God about it come on but it it's it's something within us we got to find a way to get past what our flesh wants but what we as a a fleshly inside wants a desire and say lord it's not my will but Lord let your will be done you know I woke up the other night and uh like I was saying I woke up the other night and I couldn't go back to sleep this was uh probably Wednesday night I think it was and and uh so I when I couldn't go back to sleep I just started praying I was telling told Charlotte about five in the morning I've been praying all night long because I couldn't go back to sleep but you know I found myself just praying for everybody I was praying for everybody Lord help them everybody the Lord put on your heart just praying and pouring out for everybody but then all of a sudden you know it's as though I was sitting down in the stairs it's as though the Lord was showing me myself in some ways and says now you stood in the Gap and intercede for everybody but let me work on you some begin showing me it's just the little things you know in your life that he says you know I want you to reckon with this I want you to reckon with that so I began to say Lord after doing all that praying I said Lord I need your help God I don't pray for everybody to tell us Charlotte I said with it I had to pray for myself for a while because the Lord showed me hey I want you to work on this area I want you to to clean this up I want you to do that he began to deal with you in your personal life and I say it's what it is a lot of times we can see everybody else but what about you everybody else I said Lord help me you know it's certain ways you you know about yourself that you don't see but the Holy Spirit got to come down and expose it come on you you're the selfish one you're the you're the one with the attitude you're the one the Holy Spirit want to come down and show you yourself sometime but what it is like I said that inner voice you got to listen to it you got to because he gonna come and tell you you know he's your best friend he gonna tell you when you're wrong he gonna tell he gonna tell you the truth about yourself everybody else ain't gonna tell you the truth but he gonna tell you the truth he gonna tell you because he knows who you are that's one person you can't hide from we can hide from everybody else and try to be somebody that we're not and all those things but one person you can't hide from and that's God Hallelujah but he becomes he comes down and he shows us some praying you know praying for a while I begin to say Lord you know uh work on work on me help me God I want to go higher in you come on I want to do the things I said a lot of times you know people they they use uh because we know that in the in the scriptures a lot of the the uh the Patriarchs and those their mistakes were shown to you in the scriptures you know so a lot of times you know the devil uses those let you look at those mistakes and use them for for uh for a patent your own self on the back or or making your own self feel good about the weaknesses that you have or making your own self feel good about the ways that you are but you know I begin to think about one of the biggest things is is David and Bathsheba a lot of people break that up don't they I says but one thing about David he was quick to repent and and he says I thought on my ways he was quick the not only yeah but when it came out he thought on his ways didn't he he began to thank Lord I'm thinking on my ways I might be the king I might be this one but God I ain't above reproach I ain't above walking Lord created me a clean heart and renew the right Spirit on me he thought on his ways and that's where I was at the other night after I said doing all that praying I said Lord this is where I'm at I'm thinking on my ways I'm thinking of you say oh you know come on you say what you you ain't perfect nobody's perfect remember that if you was perfect you wouldn't have no need to be here no more would you but God is still what working on us ain't he God is working on us come on bringing us to that place I thank God tonight you thank God tonight you know he says who shall he says who shall abide come on who want to live in that place where God is there's no safer place that there is to be than in where God is come on I want to abide there do you want to buy there tonight come on one moment out of his presence might cost you everything one moment outer's presence might be the end of the story but if you abide in there come on abide and in that presence he said you can ask what you will abide in there come on no danger hurt no harm he says oh Israel I would love to gather you under my wings as a hen does a chick God want to take care of you he loved you so much that he laid down his life for you he gave everything for you went to the Cross he died nobody wanted to Behold Him but that's uh pilate said behold a man he didn't look like much but he was all at the work he was the maker of the world he was everything that you needed everything was wrapped up in him didn't look like much but he was a jewel hidden a hidden Jewel oh when I was a lord saved me real young I always say that all the time 19 years old and what he what he's bringing you to sometimes you didn't know didn't look like much but you found out inside of those lonely roads those lonely days sometimes but it was all right why because God was there with you he kept you guide you he held your hand like I said it's been a long journey but Jesus was right there by your side the whole time and you thank God because you look back all the mountains and the things that God's brought you through all your Breaking Point all the times when you should have just gave up and walked away but yet God was holding your hand the whole time Hallelujah do you believe that tonight you had to have been there to experience that come on but God knows I said who shall abide tonight amen [Applause] hey man you appreciate the word tonight [Applause] you don't put me on spot again amen but as he was saying tonight if you abide in him you can ask what you will and he'll do it amen I mean he said a lot of things and I appreciate the word tonight because sometimes you need a word from the Lord to speak to you you need something to come across that God has just so you can examine yourself you can look at yourself and said you know what Lord I need to grow Closer to You Lord I want to abide in you each and every day am I checking what I'm doing each and every day am I looking at myself and intrinsically thinking about Lord what do you want me to do where do you want me to go am I doing what you what you lead me and got me to do am I asking you Lord what do you want me to do and taking those moments each and every day when I wake up in the morning Lord lead and guide me today Lord lead me to where you want me to go Lord God my prayer life Lord God my each and every conversation that I have that I may be a light for you that I may Shine for and said you didn't want to be like that candle in a dark room even if it's dark around you you still spreading light and everyone around you notices that your light is shining but the only way you can do that is if you abide in them if you take each and every day and you abide in him and say Lord I want you to abide in me so that in your word to abide in me and I noticed when he said in the scripture he said it he said if your word's abide in me so it was more than one word it was the whole thing it was everything that God has said and you want it all to be inside of you so that you can always have his words in you you can always lean back and say Lord I got something to defeat the Devil I got something to defeat the when the trials and tribulations come I can look back and I got something to hold on to I got something that that not only has changed my life it's continuing to change my life it's continued to move and progress and make me better each and every day and that's what it is when you abide in him he'll continue to lead and guide you and make you grow into in what he wants you to be foreign really short amen so by the grace of God we thank God for instead of you abide in me and my word abide in you you can act what you will and not do so we thank God for brother ernage for Caleb thank God for all our visitors tonight we thank God for you we want to say I was just reading the message on Divine love and that when Divine love is there and then The Sovereign Grace would take over and that's what we want God's Sovereign Grace to take over our lives Divine love and looking at Divine love I says I was teaching in something on a Wednesday night concerning being perfect and on Mullins I decided not to preach and teach on being perfect and we hear even hear her brother Ernie said Nobody's Perfect and I says and he got in the Matthew 5 48 says be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect I said would God ask you to do something that's impossible to do so when we look at that word perfect we're looking at God says be holy for I'm holy can we be holy and I think one of the a few of the people in Sumter says only we we can be perfect only when we die and getting ready to go to heaven and uh so we had them the answer and Mullins and answer and something and I'm saying I find out nobody's perfect no artists we can't use that for an excuse but Paul says I pressed towards the marker the prize of the High Calling of God that's in Christ so it was all it has to be that that you're pressing towards that you striving for then the church we are in the age of perfection this the church that's going to be raptured is going to be a perfect without spot rank up blemish or any such thing so if we're in the age of perfection then God is not allowing us to be in the Martin Luther Day in the Reformation period of John Wesley day in uh you know the Methodist Holiness he's not allowing us to be in Azusa Street when Seymour and the Holy Ghost was pulled out on the through the street in the gift of the store but this is the age of perfection God is when we walk out of here in the Rapture you're not going to walk out here uh you know less than perfect so God is sending an anointing a presence that your condition can't be uh uh I can't stop doing this and can't stop no God is going to give you the spirit and the power to do what he said he wants in this hour so he gives you the anointing he get and God is calling for perfection so you hi it's impossible yes all things are possible to what to them that bleed if we believe what God says then it's possible are you with me I'm not going to start maybe I'll dwell on that a little bit Sunday morning but by the grace of God I just thank God for everyone and um just abide in God Amen if you're not in him it's time to do get in gone not in the church but in God Jesus said no man can come to the father except he come by me are you with me except a man be born again he cannot see or enter the kingdom of God so if we're going to want to go in the kingdom of God I'm telling you Stark out there somebody called me and told me since you know I was on my way they just killed a couple young men and Mullins then the next thing I know people house getting shot up and people and look like it's just a wall going on in Marion and Marlins you know so when I got down there I got into office somebody telling me uh a couple young men's just got killed this and that they're shooting up they really got in office tonight Ernest telling me you know they they shooting up not in one another I said so that's an area young people are being shot killed even in Columbia all over the place to see these young people here tonight I'm proud of them amen glad to see him amen when all these it's just going on all around us but yeah there's some young people that don't take time out to come into the house of the Lord on a Friday night on a Friday night so I was happy to see that amen and I'm saying in this sad out there I mean it's getting very it's getting scary skit I mean and somebody tell me the drugs has taken over the high schools and the school houses and all everything is going on it's time to turn to God with all your heart people out there need help who's going to help them they don't want to hear no old man y'all gotta do it y'all young people amen y'all see friends and neighbors everybody you know what I'm saying what's happening to young people they need somebody to tell them that Jesus loved them the Jesus care about them amen and if you don't do who's going to do it they need somebody to know that this love if you don't have that love of God in your heart you need to get it the love of God somebody got to project the love somebody got to let the light shine because people need help they need it seriously they need it bad young people I tell you it's rough it wasn't like that when I came home these people went to church they don't even want to go to church no more are you with me so by the grace of God God bless you thank God for you anybody got a testimony tonight I gotta go now if you got a testimony you ain't got to run out of here nobody got testimony tonight oh God you're still waiting to give you your testimony are you gonna tell it right now okay I was I was hoping he'd do it tonight but that's why I called on it because it was short um I'll make it short a few years back I used to I was graduated and I was I used to tell people they asked me what did I want to go back to school I used to say I said that God went out before I went to college I I got down on my knees I said a prayer I said Lord I had to take my standard test one more time I said Lord I want to make a score high enough because my parents don't have the money I don't have the money to pay for it so I said Lord I want you to provide a way the next day I went took my test got back a few months later got my score and I made the exact score I needed to to get the scholarships I needed to pay for school so I went to undergrad and God blessed me so I didn't pay a dime and they paid me so I when I got done and I graduated I said Lord if you want me to go back to school I believe you're the same guy that did it once you can do it again so a few years down the road this year this past year I got actually I got laid off on my job and back in May and I was like trying to figure out what's the next role ended up going to a local school having a conversation thinking about I was going to just take some classes but I kept getting a run around a run around someone was there and it was like you should change your approach and I said you know when I always said if the Lord opens a door for you all you got to do is walk through so I I was like you know what that door might not be open and I went down the university and I wouldn't talk to someone that asked him about information about their program and the person said um you you seem like a good candidate let me send you the application to apply now mind you I didn't do anything special and I said well the only way that I'm going is if it's free and then they said well let me see let me check out the process they go back they called me the next day and then I was looking for a one-year program but they said have you looked at the two-year program I said no I haven't and then she person called me back and said well if you if you decide on that one everything will be paid for and so the Lord has blessed me to go back to school I'm in school now full time and everything is paid for so we thank the Lord for that just proving that he said that if you abide in me you can ask what you will and I'll do it so the same God of yesterday he's just saying God today and that you can believe in what you pray for even though you may not see it coming to pass today it took five years for that prayer to come true it took five years and you said well the Lord ain't answering my prayer if you just wait your answer is on the way amen [Applause] I said he just abbreviated everything you had time because Ernest was real short so I said he had time to not to abbreviate so by the grace of God everybody's all right of Abigail that the University of South Carolina yeah who's Abigail had my daughter back then at the University of South Carolina but um when she was coming out of high school she didn't have enough money to go they didn't they said she only could get what um the life scholarship would pay for and they called them and I was like I'm sorry we don't have no other help for her we can't give her no other money or anything and so I said you know she works at Publix and they have tuition reimbursement so that gave us another four thousand dollars and she go to school I said well just get the loan that they give you at the school and then when Publix pay you back you will have to you know we'll pay the money right back to the school but it was still I believe was it sixteen hundred dollars a semester still left over and so I said well I'mma just have to pay our plan don't get on the payment plan and everything at the school and so during that same time I was applying a job came open a job that I wasn't too crazy about being a manager but I said well this job will pay more money and just to give me the money I need to pay for her tuition for school so I got the job and so after I got the job Abigail went to check I said Abigail get the thing ready let me go ahead and set up your payment plan so I can start making your payments for your classes or whatever and when she went on the board she they oh they gave her back eight dollars so you didn't have to pay anything out of pocket so I just want to thank the Lord for providing I pray that he provide for the rest of these six years [Applause] [Music] praise God my wife says she spent all her time teaching the children coming up so when they get ready to go to
