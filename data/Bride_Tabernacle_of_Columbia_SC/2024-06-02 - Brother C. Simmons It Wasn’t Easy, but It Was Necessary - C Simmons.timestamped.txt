[41:00] when you got it say amen amen and it
[41:03] reads and it came to pass after a while
[41:07] that the brook dried up and because
[41:09] there had been no rain in the
[41:13] land and the word of the Lord came unto
[41:15] him saying arise get thee to zarapa
[41:19] which belongeth to zidon and dwell there
[41:23] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[41:25] there to sustain thee so he
[41:29] rose so he arose and went to zarapa and
[41:33] when he came to the gate of the city
[41:34] behold the widow woman was there a
[41:37] gathering of sticks and he called to her
[41:40] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[41:42] water and a vessel that I may drink and
[41:46] as she was going to fetch it he called
[41:47] to her and said bring me I pray thee a
[41:50] Morse a a morsel of bread in thine hand
[41:54] and she said and she said as the Lord
[41:57] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[42:00] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[42:03] little oil in a cruise and behold I am
[42:06] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[42:10] and dress it for me and my son that we
[42:12] may eat it and die and Elijah said unto
[42:16] her fear not go and do as thou has said
[42:19] but make me therefore a little cake
[42:22] first and bring it unto me and after
[42:24] make for thee and for thy son son for he
[42:28] said for thus sayith the Lord God of
[42:30] Israel the bearer of meal shall not
[42:33] waste neither shall the cruise of oil
[42:35] fail until the day that the Lord sendeth
[42:38] rain upon the Earth amen God bless the

[42:48] little topic that I entitled it wasn't
[42:51] easy but it was
[42:54] necessary it wasn't easy but it was
[42:56] necessary the story came to my mind as I
[42:59] Was preparing and studying I thought
[43:01] about this widow woman that you and I
[43:04] thought about something that I said you
[43:05] know she came to her
[43:08] last she came to her last before God
[43:11] showed up on the scene she came to her
[43:14] last until before God showed up on the
[43:16] scene and I entitled I said it wasn't
[43:19] easy but it was necessary so many of
[43:22] times you may come to a place or may
[43:24] come to a space that it won't be easy
[43:27] but God will take you through the
[43:28] situation or the test and the trial to
[43:31] show you that when you come to the other
[43:33] side it was necessary when you done gone
[43:36] through it and maybe you look back and
[43:37] you said you know what it wasn't easy
[43:40] but it was necessary it was necessary
[43:42] for my growth it was necessary for me to
[43:45] come back and say Lord I Thank you for
[43:47] what you brought me through I thank you
[43:49] for how you delivered me and how you
[43:51] taking me through these things and I
[43:53] learned that you know what sometimes
[43:55] it's not easy but it's
[43:57] necessary and so I was thinking about it
[44:00] and she might have thought you know what
[44:02] this Prophet is asking me a lot isn't he
[44:04] I don't even know who the stranger is
[44:07] cuz she didn't she didn't even know who
[44:09] the stranger was at the time but she
[44:11] felt led that you know what this this is
[44:14] something
[44:15] extraordinary cuz everybody understands
[44:18] that at this time nobody had food nobody
[44:21] had water these were things that they
[44:23] were in a famine at this time so when
[44:26] someone comes to ask you for something
[44:28] it has to be something deep down in the
[44:30] inside that opens up to you and say you
[44:32] know what I'm going to give it's
[44:34] something deep down in the inside that
[44:36] says you know what I this is who I am
[44:39] she showed who her character was by
[44:42] offering even in her time of struggle
[44:44] she offered up to the man of God and she
[44:47] said here I don't have but a little and
[44:49] but the little that I have I'm going to
[44:51] give to you see it wasn't easy but it
[44:53] was necessary sometimes God puts stories
[44:56] there so you can see character sometimes
[44:59] he put a story there so that you can
[45:01] understand that what is required of you
[45:04] that that sometimes you're going to run
[45:05] into those
[45:07] moments that you don't understand why
[45:10] you're going to run into those moments
[45:11] that you don't understand what's going
[45:13] on you're going to run into those
[45:15] moments that you don't understand how am
[45:17] I going to make it but it ain't going to
[45:19] be easy but it's necessary it's not
[45:22] going to be easy but it's something that
[45:24] you got to go through in order for you
[45:25] to grow am something that you got to go
[45:28] through in order for you to become
[45:30] stronger it's something that you got to
[45:32] go through in order for you to get to
[45:34] where God wants you to be he wouldn't
[45:36] have given it to you if he wasn't going
[45:38] to give you a way to escape it he
[45:40] wouldn't have given it to you if it
[45:41] wasn't a reason for you to go through it
[45:44] even though some things you go through
[45:46] and he said you reap what you s because
[45:48] and you go through these tests and
[45:50] trials and it might have been something
[45:52] that happened but you know what he also
[45:54] said my steps are ordered by the Lord L
[45:57] and before you even were here he knew
[45:59] where you were going to go he knew what
[46:01] you were going to do he knew how you was
[46:03] going to act and react he he knew all
[46:06] these things and yet he still allowed
[46:08] you to go through what you go through
[46:10] and yet he still allowed you he said it
[46:12] it's not going to be easy but it's
[46:14] necessary it's necessary for you to go
[46:17] through this because I need you to learn
[46:19] something I need you to grow through
[46:21] something I need you not to stay babies
[46:23] one day but to grow up and be a man to
[46:25] be a woman to be someone that I can
[46:27] trust you with more than what what you
[46:30] have now see it might not be easy but
[46:32] it's worth it it's necessary for you to
[46:35] go through these
[46:36] things and I started to think about in
[46:39] the Bible there were many example I said
[46:41] I thought about an exodus chap 12 when
[46:44] Moses they had gone through and the
[46:46] children of Israel were in captivity
[46:49] they were in Egypt and they were held
[46:50] captive for over 400 years and while
[46:53] they were in Egypt and they was and they
[46:55] was going through the and trials it
[46:58] wasn't easy but it was necessary because
[47:01] they had done some things and God said
[47:03] this is the path that you got to go this
[47:05] is the path that you got to go but he
[47:07] said after 400 years I'm going to
[47:09] deliver you so they knew that promise
[47:12] was given to him and it was going to
[47:14] happen they didn't know how it was going
[47:15] to happen and they might have thought it
[47:17] was going to happen one way even Moses
[47:19] might have thought it was going to
[47:20] happen one way but God had a whole
[47:22] another way that it was going to happen
[47:24] it wasn't going to be the easy road that
[47:26] Moses just walk in there and say y'all
[47:28] can go free amen there was tests and
[47:31] trials that Moses had to go through to
[47:33] the point that Moses said Lord I I don't
[47:36] have nothing to the point that he got
[47:39] down so low that Lord don't why you
[47:41] going to send me the Lord had to come
[47:43] and supernaturally visit him in that
[47:46] burning bush and speak to him and say
[47:48] you know what you my servant you was
[47:50] always my servant but now it's time for
[47:53] you to do the work you see it wasn't
[47:55] easy for Moses to go through all that
[47:57] but it was necessary Moses wouldn't have
[48:00] learn that how he had to depend on God
[48:02] if he would have never gone through
[48:03] those situations he wouldn't have
[48:05] learned how to lean on him and listen to
[48:07] him and expect him to move in
[48:10] Supernatural ways if he wouldn't have
[48:12] gone through that experience if he
[48:14] hadn't killed that Egyptian if he hadn't
[48:16] run to the desert if he hadn't met his
[48:18] wife and went through those test and
[48:19] trials Moses would not have learned that
[48:21] it wasn't easy but it was necessary but
[48:24] when Moses got done and he came to and
[48:27] the Lord started doing plagues on these
[48:30] Egyptians as he was delivering the
[48:32] children of Israel and each one you
[48:34] wonder why they got worse they got worse
[48:37] and each one took a little bit more from
[48:39] those Egyptians and but the final plague
[48:41] was what we call the
[48:43] Passover and when you was in the
[48:46] Passover the Lord made a declaration he
[48:48] said all he was going to kill all the
[48:50] firstborns unless you had blood on the
[48:52] doorpost unless you had blood on your
[48:55] lentil he was going to kill all those
[48:57] first mornings and I want to say it
[48:59] wasn't easy but it was necessary see you
[49:02] don't know what God had to do in order
[49:05] for you to get to where you need to get
[49:06] to you don't know what God had to put
[49:09] you through in order for you to get to
[49:11] where you need to get to said it was
[49:13] necessary for those Egyptian Sons to be
[49:17] killed you would say why would why would
[49:20] that be necessary maybe that was the
[49:22] only way they was going to get
[49:24] delivered out see it wasn't easy but but
[49:26] it was necessary God had a way of doing
[49:29] a thing that nobody could see but he
[49:32] also was showing his children if you
[49:34] listen to what I say I will provide if
[49:36] you listen to what I say I will keep you
[49:39] saved if you listen to what I say I will
[49:41] cover you and make sure that you are
[49:43] under this blood and that you are
[49:45] covered and that God is going to take
[49:47] care of you no matter what see he said
[49:50] that you're my children and I ain't lost
[49:52] one I haven't lost one that you that are
[49:55] my seed and so it was necessary for them
[49:58] to go through that amen so when they got
[50:01] to the Wilderness they could understand
[50:03] he's still the same God he's still the
[50:05] same God that kept our children saved
[50:08] he's still the same God that parted the
[50:10] Red Sea see it wasn't easy but it was
[50:12] necessary they might have was
[50:14] complaining when they got to that Red
[50:16] Sea and didn't see a way through they
[50:18] might have was complaining and didn't
[50:20] understand it but see it was necessary
[50:23] it was something to prove that you know
[50:24] I'm still God Amen if you forgot about
[50:27] me from Egypt and delivering me I want
[50:29] to prove to you that I'm still the same
[50:31] God if you forgot about me when when you
[50:33] get on to the other side of this I'm
[50:35] going to show you that I'm going to
[50:36] destroy all your enemies cuz I'm still
[50:38] the same God and when you get down there
[50:41] and you complaining about me and food
[50:43] I'm going to send something for you
[50:44] because I'm still the same God see it
[50:46] may not be easy but it's necessary say
[50:49] God always bring you through if you
[50:51] trust him if you believe in them and you
[50:54] put your faith in them and don't doubt
[50:56] them if he said in his word he was going
[50:58] to do something he'll do it say it may
[51:00] not be easy but it's
[51:03] necessary I said Esther she got down to
[51:06] a point where she it wasn't going to be
[51:08] easy for her the decision that she made
[51:11] that she was going to make she didn't
[51:13] know the
[51:14] outcome when she walked into that King's
[51:16] room she didn't know the outcome cuz the
[51:19] decree was that if he didn't lift that
[51:21] Selter he she was gone but she knew it
[51:24] was necessary for her to do that in
[51:26] order for her to save her people and
[51:29] Mori told her maybe you was put in this
[51:31] place for such a time as this see it
[51:34] wasn't easy but it was necessary for her
[51:37] to go through that door and she said but
[51:39] but the the key to me that got me when I
[51:41] was thinking about it and I said when
[51:44] you read the story you realize that
[51:46] before she did it she
[51:48] prayed amen it wasn't that she just
[51:50] walked through the door some type of way
[51:52] and say just going she got down and not
[51:54] only did she pray she said I want all
[51:57] y'all that are here to fast and pray and
[52:00] all my maidens that maybe the saved and
[52:02] unsaved she had them fasting and praying
[52:05] because she knew that she needed someone
[52:08] to show up on the scene that was greater
[52:10] than her she needed someone to move in
[52:13] her midst that was greater than her see
[52:15] it might have not been easy but it was
[52:17] necessary see that was the way for God
[52:20] to provide a way of Escape she had to go
[52:22] through that door she had to do what was
[52:25] required of her because maybe she was
[52:27] built for such a time as this and I said
[52:31] I thought about it I wrote something
[52:32] down I said sometimes you have to have
[52:34] the right attitude during your test and
[52:38] trials says sometimes you have to have
[52:40] the right attitude during your test and
[52:43] trials say sometimes you may get to a
[52:46] place and you know what the major
[52:48] mistake that you may make is how you
[52:51] respond it's not what you did it's not
[52:53] what you said it was how you responded
[52:55] and said sometime God got to take you
[52:57] sometime multiple times even in my life
[53:00] he'll take you back through a similar
[53:02] situation until you learn you know what
[53:04] I got to respond different you know what
[53:07] I got to change the way that I'm looking
[53:09] at this situation I got to change the
[53:12] way that I'm going through this because
[53:14] if I don't I'm just going to repeat it
[53:16] if I don't I'm just going to go through
[53:17] it again and said God has a way of
[53:20] allowing you to learn allowing you to
[53:23] you know what if you my child I'm going
[53:25] to make sure that you learn this lesson
[53:28] right I'm going to make sure that you
[53:29] get this lesson no matter how long it
[53:32] takes but sometimes you canot take the
[53:35] mercies of God and the grace of God for
[53:38] granted cuz God will take you through
[53:40] test but sometimes you take yourself
[53:42] through some things sometimes you take
[53:45] yourself through some things that you
[53:47] didn't have to go
[53:49] through but don't take it for granted
[53:52] and I I said and I thought about the
[53:54] story in in Matthew chapter CH 9 where
[53:57] Jesus he healed the ruler's daughter but
[54:00] on the way to the ruler's daughter there
[54:02] was a certain young lady that had to get
[54:04] to Jesus because she had a sickness in
[54:06] her body and she realized that Lord I
[54:10] want to make it to you because I need
[54:12] something from you she didn't care who
[54:14] was around she didn't care what was
[54:16] going on see it wasn't easy for her but
[54:19] it was necessary for her to get to Jesus
[54:21] it was necessary because she knew that
[54:24] if she didn't get to him she wasn't
[54:26] going to make it see it might not have
[54:29] been easy but it was
[54:31] necessary so she got she got to the
[54:34] point that even though it was hundreds
[54:36] and maybe many people around Jesus she
[54:39] might have had to scratch and crawl and
[54:40] bump her way through but she got to him
[54:43] and when she got to him she touched them
[54:45] and her touch was different all the
[54:48] people that might have been touching
[54:49] Jesus they might Jesus didn't feel
[54:52] anything but when she touched them
[54:55] something happened amen and sometimes
[54:57] you got to get to that point that even
[54:59] if it ain't easy it's necessary for me
[55:02] to get to Jesus it's necessary for me to
[55:05] get so closed and down and so desperate
[55:08] that Lord I need you to show up on my
[55:11] behalf said you might not know about
[55:13] other people but if when you get a need
[55:16] so serious you find a way to get to them
[55:19] you might you might have not looked at
[55:21] them yesterday today but you know that
[55:23] Lord I need you today I need need you in
[55:26] this moment I need you right now and I
[55:29] need you to do something for me now
[55:32] there's requirements that if you want
[55:33] them to do it and you want him to do it
[55:35] right he said come to me and lay lay
[55:37] down all your burdens and he'll give you
[55:39] rest that's all you got to do all he
[55:42] wants is the life that you can give to
[55:44] him that's all he wants but it might not
[55:47] be easy but it's
[55:49] necessary said everybody you come to it
[55:52] sometimes and I've been to many of them
[55:54] many funerals and some times and a lot
[55:56] of people they want to put you in a
[55:58] place here or there but I said the way
[56:00] that you can make sure that you that you
[56:02] go there is follow exactly what he asked
[56:04] you to
[56:05] do you don't have to worry about it we
[56:08] don't have to worry about it nobody has
[56:10] to worry about it if you do what his
[56:11] word say do all you got to do is repent
[56:14] and come to him and be baptized in the
[56:17] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[56:18] of your sins and you shall receive the
[56:20] gift of the Holy Ghost that's what he
[56:22] requires of you but you come to it and
[56:25] it might not be easy but it's
[56:27] necessary so a Christian Life might not
[56:30] be easy but it's necessary it's
[56:33] necessary because that's what God is
[56:35] requiring of
[56:36] you I said sometimes you have to give up
[56:39] some things in life and it's not going
[56:41] to be
[56:42] easy but it's
[56:45] necessary sometimes God has to take you
[56:47] through your most difficult trials to
[56:50] give you your greatest
[56:52] blessing see that trial is not going to
[56:55] be easy but it's necessary in order for
[56:58] you to see the greatness of God it's
[57:01] necessary for you to understand what God
[57:03] is trying to do in your life and I said
[57:06] when Jesus got to the Garden of
[57:08] Gethsemane he he got to a point where he
[57:10] was praying and nobody was praying with
[57:13] him but while he was going through it he
[57:15] knew what was to come to pass for him
[57:17] and while he was going through it he
[57:20] realized that it might not be easy but
[57:22] it was necessary until he pinned the
[57:24] words and he said thy will be done
[57:26] amen he realized it was nothing that was
[57:30] important about him anymore the reason
[57:32] that he was going through it was for
[57:36] me I said the reason that it was he was
[57:38] doing it was because of you he knew that
[57:41] the only way that you can make it to
[57:43] heaven was for him to die on that cross
[57:46] the only way for you to make it into
[57:48] heaven was him to shed his blood for you
[57:50] the only way for him to make it in for
[57:53] you to make it in was for him to take
[57:55] those stripes to take those beatings to
[57:58] take those whippings on his back and to
[58:01] and to go there and to lay down his life
[58:03] for you and
[58:04] I he
[58:07] said I want to read something he said in
[58:11] in this time when Jesus was going see he
[58:13] said that when he was on his way there
[58:16] he said he got his eyes set to Calvary
[58:19] he's going right straight to Jerusalem
[58:21] to be offered for a sacrifice when he
[58:24] went to that cross he was a sacrifice
[58:26] for you and I and said the weight of
[58:28] every sin that was ever committed on the
[58:31] earth or would ever be committed was
[58:34] rested upon his precious shoulders you
[58:37] think about that all the things that you
[58:40] have
[58:41] done that wasn't right and then think
[58:44] about everyone else that had ever
[58:46] committed a sin or was ever going to
[58:49] commit a sin was on his
[58:51] shoulders just think of that burden if
[58:54] you can even think about some sometimes
[58:56] the devil would like to remind you of
[58:58] things that you have done and the burden
[58:59] that that is placed on your life just
[59:02] imagine everyone and he took all of that
[59:06] and said he was a big man but when
[59:08] people say bad things about you if you
[59:10] can just go on and forget it that shows
[59:13] that you're a big
[59:14] man said little man he said when people
[59:18] say bad things about you if you can just
[59:21] go on and forget it that shows that
[59:23] you're a big man he said little man
[59:26] can't temple with it he was too big to
[59:28] listen to criticism so many of times you
[59:31] may go through it and say you know what
[59:33] this ain't necessary for me I'm I don't
[59:35] want to hear this but if you don't hear
[59:38] it you'll never understand or grow
[59:40] through it because you'll always avoid
[59:43] it sometimes you get the things and
[59:45] somebody may say something the first
[59:47] thing you do you walk out the room I've
[59:48] done it because you don't want to hear
[59:51] it but sometimes that's the that's the
[59:53] time that you got to go through that to
[59:55] grow you got to go through that you got
[59:58] to understand it and sometimes if you
[1:00:00] listen you might hear a little bit of
[1:00:01] Truth in it it may not be you might not
[1:00:04] like how it was given to you but it
[1:00:06] might be the truth and if you listen to
[1:00:09] it you can might can grow from it see it
[1:00:11] might not be easy but it's necessary and
[1:00:14] the reason why you keep hearing it is
[1:00:16] because you ain't
[1:00:19] changing the reason why you keep hearing
[1:00:21] it and going through it is because
[1:00:23] nothing is changing and it ain't till
[1:00:25] they see some change that you won't hear
[1:00:27] it no more it's a easy
[1:00:29] fix but sometimes we don't see it that
[1:00:32] way because we're in the process of
[1:00:35] going through it but it won't be easy
[1:00:37] but it's necessary it's necessary for
[1:00:39] your growth and said see he was too big
[1:00:43] to listen to their criticism he had one
[1:00:46] thing to do and that was his father's
[1:00:48] will and sometimes we we don't spend
[1:00:51] enough time lord what do you want me to
[1:00:53] do amen getting down and searching it
[1:00:56] and say Lord what would you have me to
[1:00:58] do I was just talking to someone the
[1:01:00] other day and he was like and he was
[1:01:02] telling me he was like you
[1:01:04] know he was working and doing some
[1:01:07] things and goes to a different church
[1:01:08] and whatnot and he said you know I was
[1:01:10] in a position he said how do you know
[1:01:13] how do you know if someone else is even
[1:01:16] able to handle this position if you
[1:01:18] always sitting in
[1:01:19] it that's right
[1:01:23] right how how do you know if if you're
[1:01:26] stunting if you're not stunting
[1:01:27] someone's growth if you won't allow God
[1:01:30] to move you that's right see it's
[1:01:33] something to be in the right position
[1:01:35] where God has
[1:01:36] you if you in that position you can grow
[1:01:40] but you see even if you in the right
[1:01:42] position it may not be easy but it's
[1:01:45] necessary say God has a way of taking
[1:01:48] everything that you may go through and
[1:01:50] allowing you to learn from it and
[1:01:52] allowing you to grow from it and
[1:01:54] allowing him to build something in you
[1:01:57] that's greater than anything you can
[1:01:58] ever have and that's your
[1:02:01] character when you get done that's the
[1:02:03] only thing when you come here and that
[1:02:05] body is lifeless that's the only thing
[1:02:07] that people will speak of they will
[1:02:10] speak of your character amen and and
[1:02:12] some people you know some people they
[1:02:15] you just shake your head and some people
[1:02:16] you it's a easy thing to do because of
[1:02:19] the character of the person it's an easy
[1:02:21] thing to go because of the character of
[1:02:24] the person it said what are you doing
[1:02:27] are you following his will for your
[1:02:30] life see it may not be easy because
[1:02:33] sometime you got to let go of some
[1:02:35] things sometimes you got to lay aside
[1:02:38] some things sometimes you got to
[1:02:39] separate from some people sometimes you
[1:02:42] got to step away from some family and
[1:02:44] sometimes you got to remove yourself
[1:02:46] even in this day and age from the things
[1:02:48] that you may see from the things that
[1:02:50] you may watch from the things that that
[1:02:53] you may be surrounded with and now now
[1:02:55] days it don't even have to be in
[1:02:59] person nowaday it's so easy to consume
[1:03:02] so much but sometimes you got to set it
[1:03:05] down and get with God you got to set it
[1:03:08] down and say Lord what would you have me
[1:03:11] to do Lord what would you have me to go
[1:03:14] through and
[1:03:15] said see God he had to die for those men
[1:03:19] he had to die for him so he kept up his
[1:03:22] face set towards Calvary on this way and
[1:03:25] said you can imagine the strain that was
[1:03:27] on on Jesus the seeing Yonder of
[1:03:31] Gethsemane the agonies of galtha and the
[1:03:34] forsaking of God just imagine as he's
[1:03:37] walking up there the Earth is turning
[1:03:39] black his shoulders rubbing and his face
[1:03:41] bleeding from his wrongs and all was him
[1:03:45] even to his to his father father I if it
[1:03:49] be possible that this cup be removed see
[1:03:52] he got to the point that he knew it
[1:03:54] wasn't easy
[1:03:56] cuz he said if it was possible let this
[1:03:59] cup be removed but he realized it was
[1:04:02] necessary for him to carry that cup it
[1:04:04] was necessary for him to go to Calvary
[1:04:07] it was necessary for him to go to galtha
[1:04:10] and to die that day it was necessary for
[1:04:12] that blood to be
[1:04:14] shed because as he showed it in in Moses
[1:04:17] he was shown as a type in a shadow to
[1:04:20] show that as he cover covered them under
[1:04:22] the blood he was going to cover us under
[1:04:24] the blood even even though I wasn't here
[1:04:27] even though I might not have been
[1:04:28] thought of he was showing that you know
[1:04:30] what he that's my seed and I want him to
[1:04:33] make it so he took on all these burdens
[1:04:36] he took on all this pain he took on all
[1:04:39] this Agony because he wanted each and
[1:04:41] every one of us to make it and he GI and
[1:04:43] he gives us a choice he gives us a
[1:04:46] choice and and and he realized that even
[1:04:49] though while he was going through this
[1:04:52] that it wasn't easy but it was necessary
[1:04:54] but he realized he had to fulfill the
[1:04:56] scriptures that was written about him he
[1:04:59] had to take those stripes because in
[1:05:01] Isaiah 6 in Isaiah 53 it says that he
[1:05:06] was by his stripes we were
[1:05:09] healed see those stripes wasn't easy but
[1:05:12] it was necessary if he wouldn't have
[1:05:14] took those stripes I wouldn't had my
[1:05:16] healing if he wouldn't have died for me
[1:05:18] I wouldn't had salvation if he wouldn't
[1:05:21] if he wouldn't rose again there wouldn't
[1:05:23] be no way for me to make it up there
[1:05:26] but see he did it because it wasn't easy
[1:05:28] but it was necessary see it was
[1:05:31] necessary for him to do those things to
[1:05:33] prove to you and I that there's a way of
[1:05:35] Escape there's a way that you can get
[1:05:37] out of all the things that you going
[1:05:39] through all you got to do is come to him
[1:05:42] all you got to do is lay down your
[1:05:43] burdens and come to him and slow say
[1:05:46] Lord I want your rest Lord I want you to
[1:05:49] give me a place that I can rest and the
[1:05:51] many things that you go through the one
[1:05:53] thing that people may be searching for
[1:05:55] is peace
[1:05:56] [Applause]
[1:05:57] each and every person I don't care how
[1:05:59] much you may say that you have everyone
[1:06:02] wants to find that special place amen
[1:06:05] people search all over the world search
[1:06:07] all over the place if you got enough
[1:06:08] money you create your Oasis so that you
[1:06:11] can stay there and be there all alone
[1:06:14] you know to have your peace but there's
[1:06:16] no peace that is here except in Christ
[1:06:19] Jesus there's no peace that you can find
[1:06:22] like the like the Lord Jesus and when
[1:06:25] you have that peace he gives you that
[1:06:27] peace in the inside that no matter what
[1:06:29] you may be going through no matter what
[1:06:32] you may may be going on you can have
[1:06:34] that peace you can turn to him and you
[1:06:36] can say Lord I need more and he can give
[1:06:39] you more Lord I need more rest and he
[1:06:42] can give you that he can give you that
[1:06:44] joy that comes from the inside that you
[1:06:47] don't even understand but it's there and
[1:06:49] it's bubbling up inside of you he can
[1:06:52] give you the Holy Ghost and Jeremiah
[1:06:54] said it's like fire shut up in my bones
[1:06:57] said sometimes it comes out and and it
[1:06:59] ex and you can see it and said that it
[1:07:02] God can give you all these things all
[1:07:05] you got to do is come to them cuz even
[1:07:07] though it might not be easy to come to
[1:07:09] them it will get easier but your trials
[1:07:12] may change your trials May that don't
[1:07:14] mean you won't have trials that don't
[1:07:17] mean you won't have test and
[1:07:19] tribulation that even though it's not
[1:07:21] easy it's
[1:07:23] necessary God has a way of making a way
[1:07:26] of Escape that you may not even
[1:07:29] understand sometimes he got to take you
[1:07:31] around the corner down the bin and up
[1:07:33] the road for you to understand what you
[1:07:36] just went
[1:07:37] through and you and you look back and
[1:07:39] all you can say is thank you
[1:07:41] Jesus thank you Jesus for what even
[1:07:44] though it wasn't easy it was necessary
[1:07:47] even though I didn't understand it it
[1:07:49] was necessary even though I might not
[1:07:51] can or others around me didn't
[1:07:54] understand it it was necessary cuz all
[1:07:56] that I can do is come back and give you
[1:07:58] glory and give you honor and give you
[1:08:00] praise for what you've done for me I can
[1:08:03] always come back and say Lord I Thank
[1:08:05] You For What the way that you provided
[1:08:07] for me so even though it wasn't
[1:08:09] necessary even though it wasn't easy it
[1:08:12] was necessary and now I can say it was
[1:08:14] worth it I can say it was worth it
[1:08:17] because you brought me through I can say
[1:08:19] it was worth it because of the work that
[1:08:21] you can done I can testify that God you
[1:08:23] are a Healer because it was wasn't easy
[1:08:26] but it was necessary sometimes it was a
[1:08:28] scripture in the Bible that showed that
[1:08:30] this man he was sick and he was blind in
[1:08:33] the eyes and they was asking him was it
[1:08:35] for his parents' sin or was it for
[1:08:37] something that he had done and he said
[1:08:39] it was neither he said I just wanted to
[1:08:41] keep this to be a testimony of the glory
[1:08:43] of God and the paraphrase and that's
[1:08:46] what he did it sometime and sometimes
[1:08:48] you may not understand it but it may be
[1:08:51] a testimony to someone that's around you
[1:08:53] it may be a testimony that you can prove
[1:08:56] that God is still
[1:08:57] God said he kept doing things for the
[1:09:00] israelit to the point when they came to
[1:09:02] the to Jordan River they came in flood
[1:09:05] time see it wasn't easy but it was
[1:09:07] necessary cuz God wanted to remind them
[1:09:09] that I'm still the same God if I parted
[1:09:12] the Red Sea what do you think I'm going
[1:09:13] to do now and they might not it might
[1:09:15] have been a new generation that hadn't
[1:09:17] seen it might have been a new different
[1:09:20] people that hadn't seen what God had
[1:09:22] done they' only heard stories and
[1:09:24] sometime God all you to go through
[1:09:26] things to show it to
[1:09:28] you and if you ask him Lord I want to
[1:09:31] see you he'll show it to you Lord I want
[1:09:33] to see you work in my life he'll show it
[1:09:36] to you and don't and I and I was
[1:09:39] thinking about in a minister something I
[1:09:41] said and in those moments you can't
[1:09:43] forget to tell God thank you amen cuz
[1:09:46] he'll do something and you might have
[1:09:47] asked him for and sometimes we get
[1:09:49] forgetful sometimes but when you look
[1:09:52] back over you can't forget to tell God
[1:09:54] thank you I said that even though it it
[1:09:57] might not be easy it's necessary it's
[1:10:00] necessary for you to go through those
[1:10:02] things because if you don't go through
[1:10:03] them you won't grow if you don't go
[1:10:05] through them he won't you won't ever see
[1:10:08] the handiwork of God you won't see what
[1:10:11] God can do so he takes you through and
[1:10:14] sometimes he takes you through multiple
[1:10:15] things at
[1:10:17] once he'll let it be a almost a job
[1:10:21] where you feel like this is wrong and
[1:10:22] that is wrong and this is wrong and that
[1:10:25] is wrong WR and it's not going to be
[1:10:26] easy but it's necessary cuz when you
[1:10:29] come through it is you have a different
[1:10:32] type of Praise You have a different type
[1:10:35] of joy you have a different type of
[1:10:37] understanding of how good God is you
[1:10:40] have a different type of understanding
[1:10:42] of how wonderful God is and when you
[1:10:45] think about it you can say Lord I Thank
[1:10:47] You Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank You
[1:10:50] Lord I Thank you and that's all
[1:10:52] sometimes you can say is Lord I Thank
[1:10:54] you Lord I Thank you said sometimes
[1:10:57] that's all you get down on your knees
[1:10:59] and you pray and you spend a half an
[1:11:01] hour an hour just thanking the lord just
[1:11:03] for what he's done and it might not have
[1:11:05] been a long time because you you might
[1:11:07] have just got started on what he's done
[1:11:09] this week amen you ain't looked back
[1:11:12] five or 10
[1:11:14] years cuz that's how good God is and
[1:11:17] that's how much he can do and he does
[1:11:19] for you on a daily basis when you think
[1:11:21] about just thinking about how he woke
[1:11:23] you up this morning and you might not
[1:11:25] even woke up on the time that you wanted
[1:11:27] to but you woke up you was able to walk
[1:11:30] around you was able to get dressed you
[1:11:32] was able to use your limbs you was able
[1:11:34] to talk to speak to listen to hear and
[1:11:37] then when you think about all those
[1:11:38] small things you start thanking God so
[1:11:41] much more so much more Lord I have a car
[1:11:44] to drive Lord I got money in the bank I
[1:11:46] might have a home to live in a roof over
[1:11:48] my head and once you keep going you said
[1:11:50] Lord I Thank you see it might not be
[1:11:53] easy all the time but it's necessary
[1:11:55] it's necessary for me to go through
[1:11:57] those tests and trials cuz at the end of
[1:11:59] them he he promised that he was going to
[1:12:01] bless you see it's necessary you would
[1:12:03] never know the blessings of God if you
[1:12:05] don't go through nothing and said
[1:12:08] sometimes you trying to escape a trial
[1:12:10] that God is sending you through you're
[1:12:12] trying to escape something that God has
[1:12:14] a way to send you through it and you
[1:12:16] wondering why you keep coming back to
[1:12:18] the same
[1:12:20] point because it's necessary it's
[1:12:23] necessary for you to go through it and
[1:12:25] you will only understand it like the
[1:12:27] ssal says by and by when the morning
[1:12:30] comes so all the saints are gathered
[1:12:33] said you see that God has to take you
[1:12:35] through it for you to understand it
[1:12:38] sometimes you asking why and God just
[1:12:40] said just trust me that's it I I don't
[1:12:43] have to explain nothing to you I just
[1:12:46] want you to trust me because it might
[1:12:49] not be easy but it's necessary it's
[1:12:51] necessary for you to go through this
[1:12:53] it's necessary for you to climb this
[1:12:55] hill and go over this mountain to
[1:12:58] understand when you get up there you can
[1:13:00] look back said you know that was rough
[1:13:01] and that was treacherous but the more
[1:13:03] that I go up the higher I go the more I
[1:13:06] realize that Lord I know that you are
[1:13:08] real I know that you are God for sure
[1:13:11] cuz if it wasn't for you I wouldn't be
[1:13:13] where I am if it wasn't for you I
[1:13:16] wouldn't even climb this far so if you
[1:13:18] brought me this far you can continue to
[1:13:20] take me if you brought me this far I can
[1:13:23] continue to trust you if you brought me
[1:13:25] this far I can continue to thank you for
[1:13:27] what you're going to do and you might
[1:13:29] have only done so much but Lord if you
[1:13:31] don't do nothing else for me I still
[1:13:33] have enough praise and thanks for what
[1:13:35] you've done thus
[1:13:37] far for what you've done and the wayte
[1:13:39] that you made say even though Lord it
[1:13:41] might not be easy it's necessary it's
[1:13:44] necessary for my growth it's necessary
[1:13:48] for God for God to take me through these
[1:13:50] things and there's examples All Through
[1:13:52] the Bible that you can read what God
[1:13:54] took people through certain things and
[1:13:56] many of times he always showed up at the
[1:13:59] last
[1:14:00] moment he didn't show up when when when
[1:14:03] maybe sometimes when they called them I
[1:14:05] had another story where the woman where
[1:14:08] the Widow and and Elijah and she had a
[1:14:11] son she had been praying for a son and
[1:14:13] the son finally got there and the Lord
[1:14:16] blessed her with her son and then one
[1:14:18] day the son fell sick and he
[1:14:20] died and she got on she got on on an
[1:14:23] animal and she went to the to the to the
[1:14:25] man of God and she didn't ask him for
[1:14:28] this or that he asked her one thing she
[1:14:30] and he asked her basically how is the
[1:14:33] everything going and she said it is
[1:14:36] well it was the attitude that she had in
[1:14:39] that moment that changed her situation
[1:14:42] she knew where to go and she knew how to
[1:14:44] get there but she said but when they
[1:14:46] asked how everything was going she said
[1:14:49] it is well said it wasn't easy but it
[1:14:52] was necessary see when she got got there
[1:14:55] she needed something and the Lord he
[1:14:58] brought the prophet of God back and
[1:14:59] allowed him and the Lord blessed the son
[1:15:02] and Rose him up it was the very thing
[1:15:04] that she had prayed for but she didn't
[1:15:06] realize that it wasn't going to be easy
[1:15:09] but it was
[1:15:10] necessary and sometimes we we expect God
[1:15:14] to do things one way but he has a way of
[1:15:16] doing it all by himself cuz sometimes
[1:15:19] even though we may have a path or a
[1:15:21] thought of something that we want to do
[1:15:23] God has a way of shi it he has a way of
[1:15:27] showing it to you and say that you know
[1:15:29] what this is the path that you actually
[1:15:31] need to take even though it might not be
[1:15:33] easy or what you want is necessary so
[1:15:37] God has a way of doing these things
[1:15:39] because he wants to prove to you that
[1:15:40] I'm still
[1:15:41] God and I change
[1:15:44] not amen let us all
[1:15:48] vow Lord Jesus we thank you for this day
[1:15:51] we thank you for allowing us to be in
[1:15:54] your house one more Time Lord we ask

[1:16:44] doing and Lord we thank you for what
