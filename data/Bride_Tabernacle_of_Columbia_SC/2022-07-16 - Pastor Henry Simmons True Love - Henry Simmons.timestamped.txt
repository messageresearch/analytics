[30:11] this is the season
[30:14] the combine is coming
[30:20] though i speak with the tongues of men
[30:21] and angels
[30:23] i have not charity i become
[30:25] sounding brass and taking simmer too
[30:40] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[30:43] the poor and though i give my body to be
[30:46] burned and have not charity it profited
[30:49] me nothing for
[30:59] does not behave itself unseemly seeking
[31:01] not our own it's not easily provoked
[31:04] thinking no evil
[31:06] six
[31:11] but
[31:12] bath all things believeth all things
[31:15] hope with all things and endured all
[31:18] things 8.
[31:30] for we know in part and we prophesied in
[31:34] part 10.
[31:41] when i was a child as big as a child
[31:43] understood as a child thought as a child
[31:46] but when i became a man i put away
[31:48] childish things 12.
[32:00] together
[32:01] now by the faith hope charity and these
[32:05] three but the greater of these is
[32:07] charity god bless you towards you may be
[32:10] seated
[32:12] we're talking about
[32:13] this
[32:14] afternoon true love
[32:16] you're sharing the authority in mullins
[32:19] on last night true love amen
[32:22] praise god we talk
[32:24] sometimes uh
[32:26] love can be very blind blind love
[32:32] and in the con
[32:34] looking at true love we want to
[32:37] look at
[32:39] lovers of the
[32:40] truth so
[32:42] you know because a lot of times people
[32:46] think
[32:47] that they actually found true love
[32:51] and actually it's just
[32:53] feeling your
[32:54] love true love is
[32:57] god's love agape love
[33:00] and because people sometimes get excited
[33:03] when they found
[33:05] feeling your love and
[33:08] and sometimes a lust for
[33:10] love
[33:12] and those type things and they get
[33:14] excited about the wrong thing
[33:17] but true love is agape love
[33:20] now we understand that
[33:22] god in the beginning was called elohim
[33:25] because he had nothing to worship him he
[33:28] was a self-existent one he was that
[33:30] great fountain of love
[33:33] the great fountain of love amen but out
[33:36] of that great fountain god had
[33:38] attributes that he wanted to express
[33:42] so god created angels and angels could
[33:44] worship him and then he could be called
[33:46] god
[33:47] because god is the object of worship
[33:50] amen
[33:51] so here
[33:52] we're talking about true love amen
[33:55] true love was manifested to us
[33:58] in the form of jesus christ coming in
[34:00] the flesh
[34:02] so we saw love expressed and manifested
[34:05] to us amen
[34:07] we saw what god was who
[34:09] amen we saw god in
[34:12] in human form amen
[34:14] we saw amen the attributes amen of what
[34:18] god was saying to us and he was
[34:20] expressing we could see it being
[34:22] demonstrated and manifested in our midst
[34:25] so we thank god for true love
[34:29] now all the many times jesus
[34:32] amen perhaps when he uh took the courts
[34:35] and tied them together and whipping the
[34:36] people out the temple and perhaps it
[34:39] didn't look like true love
[34:41] amen so sometimes when god is doing
[34:45] certain things amen because people think
[34:48] the love is always amen something that
[34:52] amen they have conjured up in their own
[34:54] imaginationary mind
[34:56] he meant people want
[34:58] love
[34:59] amen they want somebody to care about
[35:02] them
[35:03] they want somebody to you know know
[35:06] feel their pain and understand their
[35:08] hurt
[35:09] and to know amen the confidence in their
[35:12] sorrow
[35:14] amen they need somebody that can
[35:16] understand amen what they are going
[35:19] through in this life
[35:20] so they want that they want that love
[35:23] they want somebody they meant that can
[35:25] understand and can take them and lift
[35:28] the burdens of life they need true love
[35:32] but
[35:33] the only one that could give them give
[35:35] it to them
[35:37] amen is jesus christ
[35:39] because he's the essence of love
[35:42] god is love
[35:45] amen
[35:46] because without god you cannot have true
[35:48] love
[35:50] praise god amen you can love your wife
[35:52] you can love your children you can love
[35:53] your family amen some people love their
[35:56] children so much and so even when their
[35:58] children were wrong amen they'll take up
[36:01] form
[36:02] they would not let them amen get uh
[36:06] corrected they love them so much
[36:08] so they were they were they're standing
[36:10] the gap no no no no don't correct my
[36:12] child
[36:13] that's true that's that's supposed to be
[36:14] true love
[36:16] uh
[36:17] and
[36:18] so sometimes true love
[36:20] amen people get confused i love my child
[36:23] so much to you know you know i i don't
[36:27] want i
[36:28] don't don't don't don't mess with go to
[36:30] school tell the teacher this is my child
[36:34] and sometimes
[36:36] it's difficult amen because they it's
[36:40] their own kind of love they're
[36:42] that they're doing it in you know in a
[36:45] protective love
[36:47] sometimes we try to protect
[36:49] amen sometimes we have to just
[36:52] understand amen
[36:54] how to love because it's not in the
[36:57] nature of man to have true love yeah
[37:00] amen it's not in the nature sometimes we
[37:02] have love for our family love for
[37:04] husband love for wife love for children
[37:06] love
[37:07] you know for one another but sometimes
[37:10] that love can be tainted
[37:12] amen it could be somewhat amen blind
[37:15] love sometimes it could be a love that
[37:18] amen we love those that
[37:20] jesus i mean the word said we love those
[37:22] that love us
[37:24] we love those that you know seem to care
[37:26] about us and so we care about them
[37:29] amen and we all caught up in that uh uh
[37:32] fashion we all caught up like that
[37:34] sometimes they meant sometimes
[37:37] you know if people don't care about you
[37:39] then you seem you don't care about them
[37:42] it seems to be that way and and
[37:45] but sometimes the person that cares
[37:47] about you the most amen could be
[37:50] blinding you
[37:51] amen sometimes the person you think to
[37:54] love you the most amen could be the
[37:57] worst thing for you
[37:59] because isaiah won the steward that he
[38:01] had a close friend azad amen it was a
[38:04] king amen and he
[38:06] and isaiah was a prophet but isaiah was
[38:09] blinded by uh ozzie
[38:12] and he said in the year king us i died i
[38:15] saw the lord
[38:17] amen he could not see god because he was
[38:19] so busy looking at us eye and sometimes
[38:22] it's things of
[38:24] us
[38:25] is in our way that we cannot see the
[38:28] lord amen but when amen we allow those
[38:32] things amen to move out the way
[38:34] sometimes god has to move our best
[38:36] friend sometimes god has to move amen
[38:39] mother or father a sister brother
[38:42] sometimes god has to move things out the
[38:44] way amen in order for you to see him
[38:48] true love
[38:50] the kind of love that said when the
[38:52] father and mother forsake me then the
[38:53] lord will take me
[38:55] amen
[38:57] god
[38:58] love
[38:59] compasses that of a mother or father
[39:02] so can't nobody love you like god
[39:06] amen
[39:07] so
[39:09] father mother could leave you but god
[39:11] said i never leave you
[39:13] and i'll never forsake you
[39:15] i'll be with you always
[39:18] even unto the end of the world
[39:20] so you want somebody that's going to be
[39:22] there for you
[39:23] always
[39:26] sometimes
[39:27] mother and father
[39:29] in their best efforts
[39:32] sometimes they can't be there in your
[39:34] most difficult times
[39:36] sometimes in the times when you have to
[39:39] make major decisions
[39:41] sometimes you you feel so distant
[39:45] that you cannot express or talk about it
[39:48] you made your troubles to nobody
[39:51] but god says amen he'll be there in the
[39:54] time of trouble
[39:55] he's a present help
[39:57] i'm talking about true love a god that
[39:59] really loves you that he's a present
[40:02] help in a time of trouble
[40:04] amen
[40:06] so
[40:07] the prophet of god talks about a perfect
[40:09] love
[40:10] you say it'll take perfect love and talk
[40:12] about going beyond the curtains of time
[40:15] and that beyond the curtains of time
[40:18] this is perfect love
[40:20] amen
[40:22] and i i
[40:23] and perfect love and when we re read
[40:25] corinthians 13
[40:27] you know sometimes people can do
[40:30] all kind of things to show that they are
[40:32] worshiping god and that they love god
[40:35] he said do i restore all my goods to
[40:37] feed the poor
[40:39] yet i have not charity it profits me
[40:41] nothing amen
[40:44] we can do all kinds of things do i get
[40:46] my body to be birthed
[40:48] and i have not charity it profits me
[40:50] nothing
[40:51] we can do a lot of things to show amen
[40:54] that we really love
[40:56] but
[40:57] amen that could be you know god sees the
[41:00] deep part sometimes we're doing things
[41:03] and sometimes we have motives and
[41:05] objectives why we do certain things
[41:08] amen see sometimes amen god will direct
[41:11] us to do something amen that is not amen
[41:16] it might be out of the norm
[41:18] amen when god love amen it'll reach amen
[41:22] and it'll cause you to respond and react
[41:26] in such a way amen that is not normal
[41:29] you you realize you're going beyond
[41:31] yourself amen it's it's a leading of the
[41:34] spirit of god it meant god is in control
[41:37] not something that just in affection
[41:40] just in conscience and memory it's not
[41:42] something amen that uh is emotional in
[41:45] your spirit amen it's something that's
[41:47] deeper than that it's the word of god
[41:50] leading you by the holy ghost
[41:52] are you with me
[41:54] so here we talking about amen how to be
[41:56] led by the spirit of love how to be led
[42:00] by the spirit of god amen and it it
[42:04] takes us humble in ourselves amen it's
[42:06] not trying to show somebody that i care
[42:09] about you it's not trying to amen
[42:12] express
[42:13] you know it's something that's down
[42:15] inside of you
[42:17] amen
[42:18] that god knows
[42:22] so his he says
[42:27] this is what i
[42:29] love let's go to first timothy i mean
[42:32] second timothy three
[42:34] second timothy three
[42:36] love
[42:38] brother and sister
[42:39] sometimes
[42:41] we battle
[42:43] we battle we have walls within ourselves
[42:47] amen
[42:51] and sometimes you have to ask the
[42:52] question do i have true love
[42:56] am i phony
[43:01] am i just a hypocrite
[43:05] do i really love my enemy
[43:08] do i
[43:09] really care about
[43:12] the lowest of the lowest
[43:15] do i just care about my family and
[43:18] my friends
[43:26] sometimes we have to check ourselves and
[43:28] check our spirit out and see
[43:31] how deep our love goes
[43:36] said on last night our love
[43:38] god to love is deeper
[43:40] amen
[43:41] then they need depths
[43:44] then any length
[43:46] then any height
[43:48] it's so deep
[43:50] amen it cannot be measured by the depths
[43:54] it's so
[43:55] wide it cannot be mentioned
[43:57] amen
[43:59] oh god
[44:02] it's god's love it's so extremely
[44:05] that we cannot express
[44:07] the essence of god's love
[44:10] amen true love
[44:12] we cannot express it now that kind of
[44:14] love that can get down inside of us
[44:18] amen and god can express its attributes
[44:21] out of us
[44:23] amen god could come down in us and get
[44:26] release himself
[44:28] and able to express himself through his
[44:31] bride
[44:33] amen god amen expressing agape love
[44:37] something the world knows nothing of
[44:40] praise god family they don't know about
[44:42] it
[44:43] husband sometimes wouldn't know
[44:46] but god can do something in you that's
[44:48] beyond measure
[44:51] something about the young
[44:53] the man and his
[44:55] friends and they were drinking and all
[44:58] and they were talking he said i know a
[45:00] christian
[45:01] and
[45:02] he's talking about his wife
[45:05] and so
[45:06] they went to the house and they play he
[45:08] played drunk
[45:10] and he started
[45:11] doing all types of stuff perhaps
[45:13] breaking up dishes and doing all kind of
[45:15] stuff
[45:17] and she said
[45:18] she kept him
[45:20] you know just singing and taking i want
[45:22] to walk there somewhat i don't
[45:24] and and
[45:26] the man was doing all kind of stuff and
[45:27] showing his friend that he had a wife
[45:30] that was really a true christian
[45:32] you know
[45:34] and sometimes
[45:36] and she was the epitome of
[45:38] a true christian that had a god pay love
[45:41] not only loved her husband amen but she
[45:44] was
[45:45] she was uh uh uh uh uh
[45:47] bound to the to the word she had agape
[45:50] love that began can take all the
[45:54] breaking up the dishes so he perhaps
[45:56] cursed and re-sand just to try to get
[45:59] her upset but he could not shake her
[46:05] perhaps she was just singing much jesus
[46:07] by the cross alone
[46:09] and all the world go free
[46:11] amen
[46:12] there's a cross for everyone and there's
[46:14] a cross with me amen amen
[46:17] and as those men
[46:19] looked at that
[46:21] and saw that kind of love
[46:24] they were convicted
[46:28] the husband was convicted
[46:30] because he was trying to show them
[46:32] something
[46:33] he knew he had a jewel
[46:36] if you were tested and you were trying
[46:38] how would you come would you pass that
[46:40] test amen if your husband came home and
[46:44] he was raising all kinds of sand throw
[46:46] his clothes and it would flow and should
[46:49] kick his shoes off and you know give me
[46:52] something to eat and when you gave him
[46:54] something throw it out
[46:57] oh lord
[47:03] go get me something else and you throw
[47:04] it out again
[47:08] lord have mercy
[47:09] see
[47:11] by the grace of god god has every one of
[47:14] us
[47:15] in his hand sometimes god
[47:17] do some things to bring out character
[47:21] to bring out the kind of character that
[47:23] he's looking for
[47:24] amen
[47:25] god let you go through certain places
[47:28] and certain things in life to bring out
[47:30] character amen that you might show
[47:33] overcoming victory
[47:35] amen that you've overcome something that
[47:38] god has placed him at the token in your
[47:40] life
[47:41] they met the baptism of the holy ghost
[47:43] is down in your soul
[47:45] amen
[47:47] love goes deep
[47:50] ii thessalonians
[47:52] 2 and 7.
[47:54] it says
[47:57] for the mystery of iniquity do it
[47:58] already work only he did not let will
[48:01] let until he be taken out of the way
[48:04] and then
[48:07] shall the wicked be revealed whom the
[48:09] lord shall consume with the spirit of
[48:11] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[48:13] brightness of his coming even him whose
[48:16] coming is after the working of satan
[48:19] with all power signs and line oneness
[48:22] and
[48:23] with all deceivedness of unrighteousness
[48:26] in them that what
[48:28] because they receive not what
[48:32] see i'm just not talking about you know
[48:34] some people can try to love
[48:36] one another but they don't love the
[48:38] truth
[48:40] they can be good church people and good
[48:44] so to speak we understand look like
[48:46] they're good christians
[48:48] but when it comes down to the word test
[48:51] they don't love the truth
[48:54] are you with me
[48:56] you can have individuals amen and i'm
[48:58] not talking about
[49:00] just
[49:01] denominationalism well i'm just not
[49:03] talking about you know
[49:05] uh per i'm talking about
[49:08] individuals i'm talking about you and i
[49:10] must examine ourselves and see whether
[49:12] or not we're in the faith
[49:14] do we have true love
[49:17] praise god uh only are we just
[49:20] expressing amen
[49:22] uh that kind of feeling your love is it
[49:24] that god paid love does it go beyond
[49:28] amen go beyond the norm amen
[49:31] amen you treat people like you
[49:34] you want to be treated but sometimes the
[49:36] person is not going to treat you that
[49:38] way
[49:39] sometimes they're going to hate you
[49:40] without a cause
[49:43] they dislike you because of your color
[49:45] your skin sometimes they dislike you
[49:48] because of your educational standing
[49:50] sometimes they dislike you because
[49:52] you're not educated
[49:55] are you with me
[49:57] sometimes they just dislike you because
[49:59] they just
[50:00] think
[50:01] that something is wrong with you
[50:04] they haven't they conjured up something
[50:06] in their mind maybe the devil whistled
[50:08] something in their ear and they said i
[50:09] don't like her
[50:11] never met you never had a conversation
[50:13] but i don't like her she thinks she's up
[50:17] i don't like him
[50:19] oh i can't stand it
[50:21] why
[50:22] look at she thinks she's up she look
[50:24] what kind of caught you drive
[50:26] you see the house they live in ah they
[50:28] think they're here they think they are
[50:29] pretty
[50:32] really
[50:36] are you with me
[50:39] so so
[50:40] you know and sometimes that may be true
[50:45] but that's not your problem
[50:48] that don't give you reason to
[50:51] dislike them or to hate them i have an
[50:53] attitude against them
[50:55] it doesn't matter what other you are as
[50:58] an individual responsible for your own
[51:01] soul
[51:03] are you up man
[51:04] so
[51:05] you're responsible amen for what god has
[51:08] given you if he's given you a god paid
[51:10] love you are responsible to let god
[51:15] express himself through you
[51:18] true love
[51:20] doesn't matter sometimes we
[51:22] the bible says
[51:24] pray for love
[51:26] praise how cast is not what
[51:29] we're intimidated because by certain
[51:32] people because of their social standard
[51:34] education understanding we are
[51:36] intimidated we have fear
[51:40] but perfect love catches out fear
[51:44] but fear has told me it is of the devil
[51:47] god has no respect a person
[51:51] are you a man
[51:53] so
[51:55] it's easy amen to to try amen within
[51:59] ourselves to understand amen who god
[52:02] chooses amen to bless
[52:06] amen because he told baal of whom god
[52:08] blessed cain no man cursed and whom god
[52:10] cursed can't no man bless
[52:13] if god blesses your brother your sister
[52:16] or son your
[52:17] or somebody down the street don't worry
[52:20] about it god can bless who here whoever
[52:22] he will
[52:23] whether they are sinner whether they're
[52:25] saying or whether they what are they
[52:30] god bless them thank god for them
[52:33] don't you wonder oh they you know no no
[52:35] no
[52:38] you know jealousy is cruel as a grave
[52:40] isn't that right
[52:42] praise god
[52:45] it says
[52:51] with all power
[52:52] and with all this
[52:54] deceivingness of unrighteousness
[52:56] in them that perish because they receive
[52:58] not the what
[53:01] the love of the one
[53:03] i'm talking about true love
[53:05] you know people have a problem with
[53:07] loving the truth jesus said i'm the way
[53:09] to what
[53:10] truth and the life
[53:12] they meant true love true love is stood
[53:14] right there before them
[53:17] and they they spit on him
[53:20] they call him visible the devil
[53:23] somebody called you busy bull good might
[53:25] call you a devil
[53:28] i'm a christian i'm not trying to tell
[53:29] you what you're calling
[53:31] yeah you're christian i'm saying no no
[53:33] no they call invisible all the power of
[53:36] heaven and earth was in him
[53:38] he was god in flesh
[53:41] yet they they call him devil they call
[53:43] him visible but he was the expression of
[53:45] true love
[53:47] he taught us how to love one another he
[53:50] taught us how to love god
[53:54] because god is his word
[53:58] receive not the love of the truth
[54:02] that they might be what
[54:05] say many people
[54:07] are not saved because they don't love
[54:09] truth
[54:11] they just
[54:13] you fall in love with the lie
[54:16] the
[54:17] love not the truth that they might be
[54:19] saved for this cause god shall send them
[54:22] what
[54:24] that they should believe or what
[54:26] yeah yeah
[54:29] sometimes we want what
[54:31] we want
[54:32] and we don't want what god has chose for
[54:35] us
[54:36] what god want to give us we don't want
[54:38] it
[54:40] we think we know better than god
[54:44] this is what i want and
[54:46] and god if you don't give it to me then
[54:48] i i i don't want what you want to give
[54:51] me i want what i want
[54:54] and see if you don't give me what i want
[54:57] then i ain't going to serve you
[55:00] see i prayed and asked god for this and
[55:02] i asked god to do that night's got to do
[55:04] that and god did not do it so but i i
[55:07] i'm upset i'm mad at god why you mad at
[55:10] god
[55:12] god has already done enough for you
[55:16] when he died on the cross shedding his
[55:19] blood
[55:20] he's already done enough he went to hell
[55:23] for you rose again and he said i give
[55:25] you eternal life that's enough
[55:29] praise god if he gives you eternal life
[55:30] all these other things

[55:35] one thing about it i got to mention
[55:38] amen i got i i got eternal life
[55:42] amen praise god i got god he's proved
[55:45] his love to me he saved me out of a
[55:48] miserable life of sin he he met he oh
[55:51] god i see so many people on their way to
[55:53] hell but you're on your way to heaven
[55:56] you've got god on the inside

[56:00] you got a god that cares about you
[56:03] amen god that fire
[56:06] praise god in your darkest hour he's

[56:20] what a friend we have in jesus
[56:23] all our sins in greece
[56:26] he bear
[56:28] what a privilege that we have
[56:30] that we can carry everything to god in
[56:33] prayer
[56:34] are you a fan
[56:36] oh jesus
[56:40] a strong illusion that you should
[56:41] believe a lie
[56:43] that they might be damned
[56:45] who believe not the what
[56:49] see true love is to love the truth
[56:52] when you don't love truth
[56:55] god can give you a delusion you can you
[56:58] can make what you want to do all right
[57:00] and justified before god this is what i
[57:03] want to do amen and this is what god
[57:05] told me to do this is what i i choose to
[57:08] do and god is blessing what i do
[57:11] you know i'm saying it's your choice
[57:15] how do we know the will of god how do we
[57:17] know what's true it's the word
[57:20] when we're outside of the bondage of the
[57:22] word and we're doing something contrary

[57:27] good you feel and it doesn't matter how
[57:29] blessed you think you are it don't

[57:33] when you're out of the word you're out
[57:35] of the will of god

[57:38] and private god said you're trying to do
[57:40] god of service without it being his will

[57:46] said if you abide in me and my word
[57:48] abiding you then you ask what you will
[57:51] are you up man and just because it meant
[57:54] the rain falls on the jets and on just

[58:50] the whole thing
[58:52] praise god
[58:56] that they
[58:58] that they all might be damned who
[58:59] believe not the truth but had pledge and
[59:02] what
[59:03] unrighteousness
[59:07] and see that that's what happens see man
[59:10] people have pleasure and unrighteousness

[59:42] okay it says
[59:44] second timothy 3 just know also that
[59:47] in the last days purdue's time should
[59:49] come for men shall be what
[59:53] lovers of their own self see the problem
[59:55] is
[59:56] true love
[59:58] is not to love yourself own self
[1:00:01] it's a love god
[1:00:05] are you with me
[1:00:07] but we know that
[1:00:09] men love themselves and that's the
[1:00:11] hindrance because we love ourselves
[1:00:14] amen instead of loving god
[1:00:18] so we have another one that we're
[1:00:20] worshiping
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:23] a lot of young folks are going in saying
[1:00:25] they're god
[1:00:27] i'm god
[1:00:29] amen so men love themselves and love
[1:00:31] pleasure
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:35] lovers of their own selves covetousness
[1:00:37] bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:00:39] to parents
[1:00:41] and unthankful
[1:00:43] and unholy
[1:00:46] when you love yourself it
[1:00:48] it causes you to respond in negative
[1:00:50] ways
[1:00:51] amen towards your parents towards things
[1:00:54] because amen
[1:00:56] if you can't have it it's selfish you
[1:00:58] want it it's mine give it to me if i
[1:01:01] can't have what i want then i'm
[1:01:03] rebellious and then i i go against the
[1:01:05] word if
[1:01:07] my flesh says i want this amen i say i
[1:01:10] want that and if i can't have it amen
[1:01:13] that i'm not coming to church i'm not
[1:01:15] going to sing anymore i'm not going to
[1:01:17] preach anymore i'm not going i'm not
[1:01:20] going to do what
[1:01:21] i got to have what i want
[1:01:24] praise god sometimes god amen he resists
[1:01:27] the proud but he gives grace to the
[1:01:28] humble
[1:01:30] amen we need humble spirits we need
[1:01:32] broken and contrite spirit we need to
[1:01:34] know the will of god amen not for
[1:01:37] you know somebody else but for my life
[1:01:40] lord
[1:01:41] i i must have my motives and reject this
[1:01:43] right i must know even what i'm what i'm
[1:01:46] doing it pleases god not that it pleases
[1:01:49] me but it please god sometimes we want
[1:01:51] to please ourselves we don't want to
[1:01:52] please god remember true love is to
[1:01:55] please god not ourselves
[1:01:57] amen jesus said i come to do the will of
[1:01:59] my father amen
[1:02:01] amen he said not my will but let your
[1:02:03] will be done but sometimes we amen
[1:02:05] exercise our will and god allows us to
[1:02:07] do our will and it's not even his will
[1:02:10] amen but his perfect will and his
[1:02:11] perfect love amen praise god is it it's
[1:02:14] perfect word
[1:02:16] are you with me
[1:02:17] so god will is his word amen
[1:02:20] and sometimes we get confused amen
[1:02:23] because we want to do a thing so bad and
[1:02:25] we desire we thank god he said when i'm
[1:02:27] oh
[1:02:28] ways please the lord
[1:02:31] he'll give you the desires of your heart
[1:02:33] amen but you got to please him first
[1:02:36] amen seek you first the kingdom of god
[1:02:38] and his righteousness and all other
[1:02:39] things will be added
[1:02:41] amen and god wants you to even yield to
[1:02:44] him and let him have preeminence let him
[1:02:46] have control of your life god i want
[1:02:48] your will to be done even if it hurts me
[1:02:50] even if i have to suffer amen god i'd
[1:02:53] rather suffer persecution i'd rather go
[1:02:55] through things amen jesus went through
[1:02:57] the agony of the cross amen but he did
[1:02:59] it for us
[1:03:01] brother and sister what we are doing

[1:03:25] blessing
[1:03:26] not a curse not a hindrance lord i want
[1:03:28] to be a blessing amen but not my amen i
[1:03:32] can't be a blessing outside of the word
[1:03:35] i got to be bound to the word and i got
[1:03:37] to make sure that i'm not seeking vain
[1:03:39] glory
[1:03:41] i'm talking my true love
[1:03:43] amen something to edit for myself
[1:03:45] something to lift me up something to
[1:03:47] take me where god don't want me to be
[1:03:51] lord but give me your humble spirit
[1:03:53] praise god let me forsake myself let me
[1:03:56] forsake all to follow you lord

[1:04:06] leave me
[1:04:08] and you'll lead me in your word
[1:04:10] because i don't know what to do oh god
