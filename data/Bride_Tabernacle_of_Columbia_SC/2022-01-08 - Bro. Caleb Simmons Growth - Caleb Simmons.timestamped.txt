[17:00] and we gotta prove

[17:10] and we gotta show
[17:13] the power of the blood
[17:19] and we gotta prove that we're not like
[17:23] those from satan's eaters
[17:27] we've got to show that we're a

[34:02] at this time we ask everyone to if you
[34:04] have your bible turn to the book of
[34:07] ephesians
[34:08] chapter 6.
[34:20] [Music]
[34:30] ephesians chapter six
[34:33] we'll start at verse 10
[34:37] when you got to say amen
[34:39] amen and it reads finally my brother and
[34:42] be strong in the lord
[34:44] and in the power of his might
[34:46] put on the whole armor of god that you
[34:48] may be able to stand against the walls
[34:50] of the devils
[34:51] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[34:53] blood but against principalities against
[34:56] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[34:59] this world against spiritual wickedness
[35:01] in high places
[35:05] wherefore taken to you the whole arm of
[35:07] god that you may be able to
[35:09] withstand in the evil day
[35:12] and having done all to stand
[35:14] stand therefore having your loins girded
[35:17] about with truth having on the
[35:19] breastplate of righteousness and your
[35:21] feet shot with the preparation of the
[35:23] gospel of peace
[35:24] above all taking the shield of faith
[35:27] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[35:30] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[35:32] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[35:34] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[35:37] god praying always with all prayer and
[35:39] supplication in the spirit and watching
[35:42] therefore
[35:43] there unto with all perseverance and and
[35:46] supplication for all saints amen god had
[35:49] a blessing to the reason of this word
[35:50] you may be seated
[35:54] amen tonight i'd like to speak on a
[35:57] little topic of i entitled it
[36:01] growth
[36:03] growth and really wanted it to be
[36:05] something simple
[36:07] but in here he says in verse 12 he said
[36:09] we were before we wrestle not against
[36:11] flesh and blood but against
[36:13] principalities against powers against
[36:15] the ruler of darkness of this world and
[36:17] against spiritual wickedness in high
[36:20] places and just that first part of it
[36:23] just realizing sometimes that when god
[36:26] he allows us to come to certain levels
[36:28] that we realize that we're not fighting
[36:30] against
[36:31] others we're fighting against
[36:32] principalities we're not fighting
[36:34] against flesh and blood but the devil is
[36:37] using and he's using different things to
[36:40] get to us
[36:42] he's using different situations to get
[36:44] to us he's using it's not the people
[36:47] it's the it's the devil using them and
[36:49] when you can look past that you can you
[36:52] can grow you realize there's a level of
[36:54] growth that you come to a level maturity
[36:56] that you've come to that you're not
[36:58] holding against a person you've come to
[37:00] that level and you said lord
[37:02] help me
[37:04] help me to see
[37:05] to see past the situation
[37:08] and continue to show forth with the love
[37:10] that you've given me for them
[37:12] and just coming to that level of growth
[37:14] that said and i liken to it i said i
[37:18] wrote something down i said we don't
[37:19] call an apple a tree
[37:21] we call it an apple
[37:23] why because even though
[37:25] but it has the seeds in it which has the
[37:28] potential to become apple trees
[37:30] it has the seeds in it to become it but
[37:33] we don't call the apple a tree we call
[37:35] it we call it an apple because that's
[37:37] the fruit of it
[37:39] sometimes we you don't see the tree but
[37:41] you but you see the fruit of it and
[37:43] that's how you know what the tree is
[37:45] because the tree has come to maturity
[37:47] that it can bear forth fruit the tree
[37:49] has come to the point where it can have
[37:51] fruit and it is and it has growth it has
[37:55] gone through its seasons
[37:56] it has gone through its changes it has
[37:59] gone through the the ups and the downs
[38:01] the times of the years they said if you
[38:03] cut a tree open and you look at the
[38:05] rings you can tell how much rain came
[38:07] that year
[38:08] if the ring is small it wasn't much rain
[38:11] but if it's fat it had a lot of rain and
[38:14] sometimes god's
[38:16] sometimes we go through seasons in life
[38:18] like that with it where we feel like god
[38:20] ain't moving god ain't blessing god
[38:23] ain't doing and and you can look at it
[38:25] and say that was just a season
[38:27] that was just a point in time
[38:29] but if i continue to grow god has got to
[38:32] do certain got to do more than i can
[38:34] think of and maybe it's not the season
[38:36] for that maybe it's not the opportunity
[38:39] for that but if i continue to grow i
[38:41] continue to put forth the effort i
[38:42] continue to plan i continue to take out
[38:45] all the weeds around the plant if i
[38:47] continue to do that this seed is going
[38:49] to grow
[38:50] if i continue to water let the sun get
[38:52] to it the seed is going to grow
[38:55] that and you look at a tree in some
[38:57] seasons
[38:58] it didn't have much water
[39:00] but this tree still lived
[39:02] the tree still continued to go on the
[39:05] tree didn't die
[39:06] it just stayed there in in in the show
[39:09] for the cycles of time
[39:11] the cycles of time that it was going
[39:13] through and said and we have to we have
[39:16] to grow in god in order for god we have
[39:19] to grow
[39:20] in order for god to take us higher
[39:23] we have to grow
[39:25] through some different things and go
[39:26] through some different things and come
[39:28] to that growth stage where god can take
[39:30] us to the next level well god can take
[39:32] us into the higher of the highest and he
[39:34] wants to take us there but we sometimes
[39:37] we're not mature enough to go there we
[39:39] we're not we're not on the level that
[39:41] god wants us to be so that we can reach
[39:43] where he wants to bless us we're not on
[39:46] the level where god wants us to be where
[39:47] he can put us in higher positions
[39:50] because we haven't grown we're still
[39:51] looking around
[39:53] we're still looking at waiting what well
[39:55] well i didn't get much rain
[39:58] but that person did
[39:59] over there the cloud the cloud came this
[40:01] far and then it stopped but i was
[40:03] sitting here
[40:05] but god god god can always move the
[40:07] cloud your way he can always come and
[40:10] give you the extra and let it blow your
[40:13] weight so that you can still get get the
[40:15] blessings of god
[40:17] it said
[40:18] i said i wrote something else i said
[40:20] before god can entrust us with more we
[40:23] have to grow you have to grow in spirit
[40:25] we have to grow in prayer
[40:27] we have to take those times out studying
[40:30] we got to take those times out and
[40:31] loving god giving him back everything
[40:34] that he gave to us and more
[40:36] david said in psalms he said if i had 10
[40:38] 000 tongues it wouldn't be enough to
[40:40] praise them all god just asked us i
[40:43] heard someone said recently that god god
[40:46] then god just asked us to praise him
[40:49] he didn't ask us to do anything else he
[40:51] just asked us to give give him glory
[40:53] give him and give him the praise
[40:56] he didn't ask us to cry he didn't ask us
[40:58] the whine he asked us to give him praise
[41:00] no matter what we're going through we
[41:02] can give him praise because there's
[41:05] always someone that's going through
[41:06] worse there's always if you look to your
[41:09] left someone may be down and out you
[41:11] look to your right someone may be down
[41:12] and up but god is keeping you
[41:15] god is keeping you he's growing you even
[41:18] through the midst of the struggles when
[41:20] the rain sometimes some plants die
[41:22] the one right next to the tree may die
[41:24] but god is keeping you and sustaining
[41:27] you to allow you to continue to grow you
[41:29] allow you to come through that season in
[41:32] a season where he can bless you even
[41:34] more he just and many times god just
[41:36] want you to stand strong stand firm in
[41:39] what you believe be like that tree
[41:41] planted by the rivers of water
[41:43] and you cannot be moved
[41:46] god god is doing so many things and i
[41:48] believe god wants to take us higher but
[41:50] we have to grow
[41:52] we have to get past some things we have
[41:53] to we have to continue to move forward
[41:56] so that god can do it
[41:58] god wants to do it i i remember the
[42:00] story that i heard a long time ago it
[42:03] said there was this man he had he had
[42:05] passed away and he went to heaven
[42:07] and and i might have told the story
[42:09] before but he said he went to heaven and
[42:11] the angel was taking him on a tour
[42:13] around heaven and he went past his room
[42:15] and the door was halfway cracked
[42:17] and he saw the room the wrong he glassed
[42:20] out the room the room was full of
[42:21] presents
[42:22] all these types of different things but
[42:24] the angel came and closed the door real
[42:27] quick and he was like what's in that
[42:28] room
[42:29] and and then when he came forward the
[42:31] angel finally he finally pestered the
[42:33] injured enough to to the point that the
[42:35] angel finally told him he opened up the
[42:37] door and he said
[42:38] he said this room was full of all the
[42:40] blessings that god wanted to give you
[42:42] but you wasn't ready
[42:44] this room was full of all the things
[42:46] that god had prepared for you on earth
[42:48] but you wasn't ready and sometimes it
[42:51] takes that level of growth and you come
[42:53] to the point where god wants to bless
[42:56] you but you wasn't ready
[42:57] you wasn't you hadn't grown enough you
[42:59] hadn't come through enough for god to
[43:01] give you the things that he wanted to
[43:03] give you so the lord holds them back
[43:06] it says in first corinthians
[43:08] one scripture and there first
[43:09] corinthians chapter 13 and verse 11.
[43:15] i'll turn to it
[43:21] chapter 13 and verse 11 paul was
[43:24] speaking here
[43:26] uh and he says
[43:28] when you got to say amen
[43:30] amen
[43:31] paul was speaking here he said when i
[43:33] was a child i spake as a child
[43:35] understood as a child i thought as a
[43:37] child but when i became a man i'll put
[43:40] away childish
[43:41] childish things and it goes on i'll read
[43:43] the read the next verse he said for now
[43:45] we see through a glass darkly but then
[43:48] face to face now i know in part but then
[43:51] shall i know even as
[43:53] also i am known
[43:56] and see paul paul realized there was a
[43:59] level that he he had to grow to
[44:02] just like a child when a child
[44:04] understands certain things and i take
[44:06] you back to the classroom i said you
[44:07] can't teach someone algebra if they
[44:09] don't know how to multiply
[44:11] you can't teach someone
[44:13] if they can't add it's hard for them to
[44:15] you you teaching them complex things
[44:18] that they may never understand because
[44:20] they don't have the basics and sometimes
[44:22] god has to take us and make sure that we
[44:24] got the basics before you can move on
[44:27] and if you if you never get the basics
[44:29] you'll never move forward and you got to
[44:31] take the time to learn the basics you
[44:34] got to take the time and studying and
[44:36] sometimes that's all by yourself
[44:38] sometimes that's with a teacher but
[44:40] sometimes you got to put in that alone
[44:41] time for yourself to grow you got to put
[44:43] in the time studying for yourself
[44:46] before you can get to the level where
[44:48] you can do the high level things it
[44:50] doesn't mean that god don't put people
[44:52] there to guide you it doesn't mean that
[44:54] he's not leading you but you got to
[44:55] still put forth an effort
[44:58] you still got to go through it and still
[44:59] put forth the effort so that you can
[45:01] grow for yourself so that you can mature
[45:04] and as you learn and as you grow and you
[45:06] go you understand things differently
[45:09] i i said even in my own life the person
[45:12] that i was five years ago and the same
[45:14] person today
[45:15] because of life experiences and things
[45:18] that you've gone through that you've
[45:19] grown amen
[45:21] and you gotta allow people to grow
[45:23] because god can do things overnight for
[45:25] someone and they can see
[45:27] sometimes sometimes we don't understand
[45:29] because we can't see
[45:31] we can't see god hasn't allowed us to
[45:33] see it but when it comes clear to you
[45:35] you can you can make a different
[45:36] decision you can make a different
[45:39] different thing that you want to do
[45:40] because god has allowed you to see
[45:43] because you've grown to the love of god
[45:44] said i can show you this now
[45:46] you've grown to the level that god said
[45:48] i can open this up to you now now you
[45:50] can now you can focus in and see it from
[45:53] a whole new light than what you viewed
[45:55] before
[45:56] and and i'd like to say that god is
[45:58] expecting a mature bride that knows who
[46:01] she is and the power that she possesses
[46:04] god is expecting us to grow to the
[46:06] maturity level that he can give us the
[46:08] power to speak things he can give us the
[46:11] power to move things and god can give us
[46:13] the power that in james he speaks about
[46:16] it in james chapter
[46:19] 1
[46:21] i want to say it's changed let me turn
[46:23] to it
[46:35] and james i'm gonna paraphrase crazy
[46:37] because i can't find it off the top of
[46:38] my head i should have written it down
[46:39] but james he talks about it that many
[46:42] times we ask but we ask a miss
[46:44] we ask for something but we asking for
[46:47] the wrong thing in the wrong season
[46:49] and we asking for the wrong thing maybe
[46:52] i i liken to like the one like the
[46:54] season there's four seasons in order for
[46:56] something to live something has to die
[46:58] in order for something to grow something
[47:00] had to die before it to come before it
[47:03] and many times we asking for the things
[47:05] out of season
[47:06] out of out of our season we asking for
[47:08] the rain when we need sunshine
[47:11] we asking for the sunshine when we need
[47:12] it to rain but god wants to give us
[47:15] everything in the right season for our
[47:17] life god wants to give us everything in
[47:19] the time that he has
[47:21] allowed us to in philippians 4 13 it
[47:24] says i can do all things through christ
[47:27] that strengthens me i can do all things
[47:29] because god he wants us to come to the
[47:31] love of maturity where that he can give
[47:33] us the power where we can believe and
[47:35] possess everything that he wants us to
[47:38] we can believe and possess everything
[47:40] that he wants us to
[47:43] and it's it's really important to see
[47:46] that how god if you look back over your
[47:48] life
[47:50] you can see how god has grown you
[47:52] how god has matured you through time and
[47:55] sometimes you may not see it in the
[47:57] moment when you're going through it but
[47:59] when you look back over your life you
[48:00] see what god has brought you through
[48:02] where god has kept you from from things
[48:05] that seem and unseen that when you look
[48:07] back and say those could have been
[48:09] detrimental decisions
[48:11] detrimental decisions but god continued
[48:13] to move us through and continue to allow
[48:15] us to grow to a certain level that now
[48:17] we can see it we didn't understand that
[48:20] those were detrimental decisions because
[48:22] we wasn't mature enough to see it but
[48:24] god still allowed us to keep us
[48:27] and i said many times even young people
[48:29] understands that god puts your parents
[48:31] in your life for a reason
[48:33] because many a time they have been
[48:35] through things even though you think
[48:37] they may not understand they have been
[48:39] through things where they trying to lead
[48:41] you and guide you from making the wrong
[48:43] decision
[48:44] they try because they've grown through
[48:46] those things they've gone through those
[48:47] things so they can tell you about it
[48:49] even though you may not want to hear it
[48:51] i can even look in my life when my
[48:53] parents told me certain things and you
[48:55] know sometimes i was hard-headed so i
[48:57] had to figure it out for myself
[48:59] but then i went back and realized that
[49:01] they was trying to spare me from some
[49:03] things
[49:04] they was trying to lead and guide me
[49:06] away from some from pitfalls that the
[49:09] god he still kept you through it but you
[49:11] didn't have to go through it if you only
[49:13] would have listened
[49:14] you didn't have to go through it if you
[49:16] only would have listened and god pushed
[49:18] him there so that you don't have to grow
[49:20] through those he can take you through
[49:21] different things
[49:23] god can take you through different
[49:24] things just by listening and listening
[49:26] to the wisdom
[49:28] of the ones that are around you
[49:31] and
[49:33] just understanding that god is trying to
[49:35] grow you
[49:36] god is trying to god may put certain
[49:38] things in your life just to grow you he
[49:41] may put you in certain situations so
[49:44] that you can grow
[49:45] he may put you through certain around
[49:47] certain people so that you can grow
[49:49] god may take you out of situations that
[49:51] you thought were beneficial so that you
[49:53] can grow
[49:55] god may take you out of certain
[49:56] situations you don't understand why god
[49:59] is moving you
[50:01] and
[50:02] it may be for your benefits
[50:04] but sometimes we have the wrong attitude
[50:06] while we're going through it i know i've
[50:08] been guilty of it while you're going
[50:10] through that moment because you don't
[50:12] understand
[50:13] you don't understand what's going on but
[50:15] god is moving on your behalf behind the
[50:18] scenes and when you don't even like like
[50:21] the song says even when you don't see it
[50:23] he's working
[50:24] even when you don't believe it he's
[50:26] working and he never stops
[50:28] god never stops working because
[50:31] and i'm going he said he's a weight
[50:33] maker a miracle worker a promise keeper
[50:35] a light in the darkness that's who he is
[50:39] that's just who god is
[50:41] he's the one that's going to keep you
[50:42] through everything he's the one that's
[50:44] going to make sure you get the sun at
[50:45] the right time the rain at the right
[50:47] time the right nutrients at the right
[50:50] time he's going to let this leaves fall
[50:52] on the ground so that you can resurrect
[50:54] in the spring he's going to be the one
[50:56] that's going to lead and guide you he's
[50:58] going to grow you
[50:59] so that you can reach that ultimate
[51:01] level of perfection god is going to do
[51:03] that for you
[51:05] so that you can reach that level of
[51:07] perfection
[51:08] i want to read something that says
[51:10] that's the way it is with christ
[51:13] see
[51:14] we've got to get we've got to be so in
[51:17] love with him
[51:19] so when we ask for any for something
[51:22] and he doesn't give it to us that
[51:24] doesn't shake us a bit
[51:27] when you ask for something and god
[51:29] doesn't give it to you it doesn't bother
[51:31] you
[51:32] because you realize that god has a
[51:34] season for
[51:36] for you
[51:37] not for somebody else god may have
[51:39] different seasons for them and different
[51:41] times for their life but god got a
[51:43] season for you he said
[51:44] he said to when we ask for something he
[51:47] doesn't give it to us and that doesn't
[51:49] shake us
[51:50] ccy and that's the only way you can do
[51:53] that is to become partakers of his
[51:56] divine nature
[51:57] then you'll understand the reason he
[51:59] can't give it to you
[52:01] partakers of his divine
[52:03] nature
[52:05] and just understanding that god has
[52:07] those seasons
[52:09] those seasons of growth
[52:11] the seasons of the good and the seasons
[52:13] of the bad it's all about how you
[52:15] respond to it it's all about what you
[52:17] take from it and how you grow from it
[52:20] it's all about how you plant your roots
[52:22] and you dig down and put your time in
[52:24] god's word you put your time and say
[52:27] lord i don't know how but you gonna
[52:29] bring me through it
[52:30] and the season even the season i think
[52:33] of the story of joseph where joseph had
[52:35] to come interpret pharaoh's dream and
[52:37] said you're gonna have seven years of
[52:39] plenty and seven years of famine
[52:42] but god allowed joseph to be in the
[52:44] right position to store up for those
[52:46] seasons of famine and god is allowing us
[52:50] in this time to have the opportunity to
[52:52] store up
[52:53] he's given us the opportunity to be in
[52:56] this house together one more time we've
[52:58] seen what it looked like when we're not
[52:59] able to come together but god has
[53:01] allowed us to come together one more
[53:03] time and to be in the midst of one
[53:06] another to give him the honor to give
[53:08] him the glory and the praise so we got
[53:10] to take advantage of it
[53:11] we got to use the season to grow because
[53:13] you never know when you don't get the
[53:15] opportunity too
[53:17] you never know when the when the rain
[53:18] may stop and it may slow down
[53:21] the rain may stop coming in the same way
[53:23] that you see it today god is allowing us
[53:25] to get there in these seasons
[53:27] and to grow
[53:29] he's allowing us to see these things
[53:38] there was a story about a young lady and
[53:39] she said
[53:41] she came to the prophet of god and she
[53:44] she said um
[53:48] she said
[53:49] she had a testimony
[53:51] and she and she came and she said you
[53:53] know i ain't what i ought to be
[53:55] i ain't what i want to be but one thing
[53:58] i'm sure of i ain't what i used to be
[54:00] and i and i think of how the bible says
[54:02] that he said i would that you'd be hot a
[54:05] cold because i'll spew you out of my
[54:06] mouth if you lukewarm to paraphrase the
[54:09] scripture and it's in it it's always
[54:11] should be a season whether you know it
[54:13] or not you're growing
[54:15] you're either dying or you're growing
[54:17] one of the two there is no in between
[54:20] you either dying or you're growing and
[54:22] you get to pick the choice which one you
[54:24] want to do
[54:25] you get to pick the choice to say i want
[54:27] to live or i want to die
[54:30] every every every crossroads you come to
[54:32] has a decision to it
[54:34] do you want to live or do you want to
[54:36] die and you make that decision
[54:38] which way are you going to grow you're
[54:40] going to grow up and you're going to
[54:41] grow down
[54:42] because every tree comes to the point
[54:44] where the branches that get too heavy
[54:46] and it falls
[54:47] but god allows us to decide it said
[54:51] we may not be where we ought to be
[54:53] and maybe not where we should be
[54:56] but we're not where we used to be
[54:58] god has done so much for us and allowed
[55:00] us to come to these seasons where we can
[55:03] grow
[55:04] we can we can see what god is doing
[55:07] and just in those seasons where where
[55:08] the rain is plentiful you got to do the
[55:10] most that you can
[55:12] you got to do the most that you can so
[55:14] that god can continue to move god can
[55:16] continue to push forward god can take us
[55:19] into higher places and deeper deaths in
[55:21] him god can allow us to reach forward
[55:23] and become
[55:25] that image of what he wants us to be
[55:28] that image of what he sees us to be not
[55:31] what we see ourselves to be
[55:32] not what we envision this is what i want
[55:35] to be and this is how i think i can
[55:37] become but god wants to take us into
[55:39] what he wants us to be he wants to grow
[55:42] us into
[55:43] into the object of of his of his divine
[55:47] his divine vision for our lives
[55:49] his divine path for our lives and he
[55:52] allows us to go through certain things
[55:53] that we can't grow to that
[55:55] we can we can become
[55:57] what it is and it's all about how we are
[55:59] responding
[56:00] how we are looking at it and many times
[56:02] we can have the wrong the wrong outlook
[56:04] on it
[56:06] but god can still allow those to come
[56:08] out for our good
[56:09] god can still allow those even though it
[56:11] may be in the season of drought
[56:14] god can give you just enough strength to
[56:16] make it to the season of plenty
[56:18] he can give you just enough strength to
[56:20] make it through to the next season he
[56:22] can he can persuade you on sometimes the
[56:25] winters are long
[56:27] but just know like they said they said
[56:29] trouble don't last always
[56:32] joy cometh in the morning
[56:34] trouble don't last always and god allows
[56:36] us to go through certain things so that
[56:38] we can't give him all the glory
[56:40] even in the even in the down moments we
[56:43] can give him glory
[56:44] because we know that still in those
[56:46] moments he's still keeping us
[56:48] like joe job had everything taken from
[56:51] him his wife even came and said
[56:54] the curse is god and die
[56:55] but he said
[56:57] he said naked i came into this world
[56:59] naked i shall return he wasn't going to
[57:01] turn his back onto god that even though
[57:03] he everything was taken from him he
[57:05] couldn't turn his back on the one that
[57:07] gave him everything he couldn't turn it
[57:09] even in the season of it seemed like his
[57:11] season of drought
[57:13] he wouldn't turn away from the one that
[57:15] gave him life he would never turn away
[57:17] from him he didn't know that the plenty
[57:19] was on the way he didn't see it he
[57:21] didn't see the season of blessings on
[57:22] the way but he in this season of draw he
[57:26] couldn't give up
[57:27] he couldn't he couldn't give up he said
[57:29] i'm still going to continue to grow
[57:31] i'm still going to continue to be this
[57:33] witness i'm still going to continue to
[57:35] be a light i'm still going to do these
[57:37] things i'm not going to turn my back and
[57:39] just turn and just die
[57:41] i'm not going to turn around and just
[57:43] die and just give up he said i'm going
[57:45] to continue to grow
[57:47] and god saw that and he honored that and
[57:49] he con and he gave him more than he he
[57:52] ever had what he ever thought that he
[57:54] could have because god saw his his
[57:56] revelation to stand firm god saw that he
[57:59] wanted to continue to grow even even in
[58:02] the midst of everything even in his
[58:04] season of drought
[58:06] and just understanding that
[58:08] we we are all making decisions every
[58:10] single day
[58:12] things and decisions are coming unto us
[58:15] that and things are happening around us
[58:18] and even if it may be a season of
[58:19] drought god can still continue to grow
[58:23] god can still continue to take those
[58:25] situations and show how he can get forth
[58:28] all the glory
[58:30] he can give forth all the praise he can
[58:32] give us all the honor and it's just how
[58:34] we approach it and how we say lord in
[58:36] these moments let me pray harder
[58:39] let me study longer
[58:41] let me get on my knees and get down and
[58:43] make sure that i got to understand that
[58:45] when i pray i can reach you
[58:47] when i get down on my knees lord i need
[58:49] something from you lord i i don't want
[58:52] to get down here just say some words
[58:54] lord i want to touch heaven and know
[58:56] that you touching back down on earth
[58:58] lord i want that to happen in my life
[59:00] each and every day every single time i
[59:02] pray lord i want people to know that you
[59:04] are in the midst that you are here with
[59:06] us each and every time that lord we give
[59:09] you the glory and the honor and all the
[59:11] praise lord we want you in our midst we
[59:14] want you to come down and move in this
[59:16] place move in our homes moving our cars
[59:18] move on our jobs lord that's what we
[59:20] want each and every day lord we want you
[59:22] to continue to grow us each and every
[59:24] day so that you may get all the glory
[59:26] and all the honor and all the praise
[59:28] lord and and that's that's what all that
[59:31] i i wanted to get across was that god
[59:34] can do everything that we want him to do

[1:05:45] your life and you don't see where the
[1:05:47] growth is taking place
[1:05:48] and people are just taking time and just
[1:05:50] going through the motions
[1:05:52] but we have to be able to look at our

[1:05:57] thank god that he gives us things to
[1:06:00] help us to grow he gives us a situation

[1:06:09] you examine yourself you see what you
[1:06:10] need to get better at amen and i
