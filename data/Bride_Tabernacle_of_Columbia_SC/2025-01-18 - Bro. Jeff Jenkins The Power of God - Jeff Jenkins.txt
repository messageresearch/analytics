Amen the power of God Amen how many than God for the power of God tonight amen the power of God is the Holy Ghost amen living in The Believer amen 1 Peter 1 and5 and then we're going to read um 1 Corinthians 1:18 then Romans 1:16 amen amen 1 Peter 1:5 says who I kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to reveal in the last time how many we live in the last time tonight amen am also we live in the last time we know God is he's still the same God who's keeping his bride amen so on First Corinthians amen 1 and8 it says for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God Amen how think God be saved tonight amen amen it's a power and last from Romans 1 and 16 praise God it says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it's the power of God un salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek may the Lord bless you his word you may be seated tonight amen amen but so good to be in the land of living amen amen know that God is he's alive and well I don't care how what you be going through tonight amen we serve a powerful God Amen and that same God was with Moses that same God is with Jeremiah Peter brother brand that same God is with you tonight amen and I don't care what what make what come may go in your life man the power of God is within you amen Jesus Christ said uh first John 1 John 1 12 says but as many as receive him and who is him him is the word amen so when you receive the word you receive power amen and say we receive him he to gave he to them he gave power to become the sons of of God even to them that believe in not anybody name but in Jesus name amen so realize when when Jesus come ins sight the Bible says rep baptized and you shall receive power when that power is dynamite amen that power is something that give you overcoming power that power is something which you can't do the Holy Ghost can do amen so one thing about God I I find in my Christian Life you cannot lean on your ability amen cuz your ability only can get you but so far amen I how I don't care who you are how much how muchy you got how how much popularity you are you going sometimes you ain't going to feel like you you going to be depressed amen amen you going to feel like the world is falling apart Amen in in the human nature everybody have emotions amen if you ain't got emotions you dead amen everybody got feelings but one thing about a Believer a Believer got a redeemer amen I think about how I think about how sometime we get caught up in in things I I know what sister so and so done to me listen I know what brother so and so done to me but have you know what God done for you amen do you know can you truly say I know my redeemer liveth amen and realiz he's too wise to make a mistake amen I don't care what you going through if you a child of God God is able to see you through amen praise Goden we not remember it's not our it's not pastor of Simon's power it's God's power it's not brother brenon power it's God's power it's No Man's power it's God's power amen remember you are living by the the life of God praise God Amen so lot of time you know lot of time people realize in this hour that we're living in that God gave you one thing to defeat the Devil with that's the word amen I need new Bible my Bible fall apart but thank God this the word stands forever amen amen but one thing about God God word god word will defeat the Devil any place any time under any condition amen okay care what you care how care how bad things get in your life you can all always lean on the word and the word will see you through amen flesh will fail you mama will fail you Daddy will fail you but I know a man who will never fail you a man his name is Jesus Christ amen and he is the wordy man see one thing about believe I believe believe know I believeing know our sufficiency is of god whatever we get from God where whatever whatever whatever thing we get we all know it must come from almighty God Amen amen so when it's out they believeing in the power of God is what they believe amen and when you get how many got the Holy Ghost not amen I've been KN your pastors I was uh about 14 years old I'm 51 years I turned 51 January 9th am man and I've been KN for for that long and and always always what what what what what look at me what what I think about in life that if if it kept him it could keep me amen the Bible say he has no respect of persons so I look at Pastor Simmons look at brother Nathan Nathaniel my pastor Brother Anderson all all all those ones I grew up watching and admire say Lord how are they able to stand in the last days cuz every man is TI to they man I how they got the devil going to tip you amen I've been tipped it I've been tried I've been tested but they the token has held amen can I get I've been tempted I've been tried I've been I know the token has helped in the good time in the bad times the token has always healthy man cuz the token is the life of God because if God don't keep you you will not get get be kept amen you must be kept by God so it's not and it and we we living in the last days that people people people looking for someone to to to to to deliver them they everybody looking for a way to release themselves or or or or or or or or or in in a bad time how can I over come in a situation but the word of God is here Saints to help you in every situation of your life so power of God says amen power of God says that see right quick amen how many love the Lord amen amen he says but this this is this is the conflict between God and Satan let me tell you tonight man I look at our church and look at every look at things going going on being sad don't move God Amen being depressed don't move God what moves God is Faith amen and faith is a revelation knowing that God going to work it out for your good amen no how that's what I say that's what say in everything give thanks amen some things in life you do you will never understand amen but you know that one thing God has it all in control amen because you don't figure out God Amen you don't you know you don't reason with God you believe God know God so if God bring me to the situation if you bring me to if God bring you to the red SE if you put you there God Will Make A Way man it's not up to you to part the red SE it's you to trust in God he's more than able to partner with amen so any situation you must lean on the word of God Amen I was think tell another church man I tell the church man other day man on Wednesday night man you sometimes people can know they hurt your feelings they can know you they have done you wrong if you let that person that done you wrong control you you'll be a miserable person amen because oh sometime you think you think oh I I'm I'mma look sad so they can feel sorry for me so they can say they sorry it don't work like that cuz some people don't care amen do you realize some people don't want to be happy some people like to be depressed amen some people like to be miserable some people like to be Po and broke amen but not I believe amen I believe say let the weak say I'm strong let the poor say I'm rich Amen Let the bounce free man a Believer won't be set free by the power of God amen amen but if you want to stay poor Miser you can stay poor amen it's all up to you amen amen amen but if you think some people going to be going to have s for you you about you forget it right now some people love to see you being down amen amen because misery love company amen that's it's always good to hang about somebody that's positive that's doing something for the kingdom of God Amen I learned a long time ago if you ain't if you Ain if you ain't doing nothing for the king of God you ain't got to you ain't got to go and to serve God I ain't got time for you man cuz I want nobody to keep me down I I go higher I'm going to go higher and higher in the height of God Amen but say this Amen in the com being God and Satan said but God said stay right there what that God want you to stay with the word amen in a good time stay with the word amen in a bad time stay

all baptized into one body and that body is Christ is that right yes sir by one spirit all baptized into the body of God Amen then you're baptized into God let me ask you this question tonight is God weak can God lie no it's impossible for God to lie am can God fail no it's impossible for God to fail so if God promis you anything you got say God you said so so I'm waiting on you to make the word manifest in my life amen and you stay right there to the change comen but God can't fail men may fail people may fail but one thing God cannot fail amen let me say again it's impossible for God to lie so God promise you anything if you promise you the Holy Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost right now amen if you only believe if you're sick you already healed if you're broke you're already rich amen if you're bound you're already free amen why cuz the word says so amen praise God Amen don't lean on what you going through lean on the word amen take all he says Lord God can stop anything from
