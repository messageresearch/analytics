first corinthians 13. first corinthians 13. i'll read the first you'll read the next and we'll read the 13 together praise god god is good first corinthians 13 chapter it's good to be in the house of the lord again hallelujah rule the x john f they said what for what went you have to see a reeve shaking in the wind well what went you out to see amen and said that john was more than a prophet amen so we thank god that we come to see jesus sir we would see jesus in this end time when the corner wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but he fit praise god it dies it'll come up again amen amen we're living in harvest times amen this is harvey's time brother we should reap the harvest this is the season the combine is coming though i speak with the tongues of men and angels i have not charity i become sounding brass and taking simmer too and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing for does not behave itself unseemly seeking not our own it's not easily provoked thinking no evil six but bath all things believeth all things hope with all things and endured all things 8. for we know in part and we prophesied in part 10. when i was a child as big as a child understood as a child thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things 12. together now by the faith hope charity and these three but the greater of these is charity god bless you towards you may be seated we're talking about this afternoon true love you're sharing the authority in mullins on last night true love amen praise god we talk sometimes uh love can be very blind blind love and in the con looking at true love we want to look at lovers of the truth so you know because a lot of times people think that they actually found true love and actually it's just feeling your love true love is god's love agape love and because people sometimes get excited when they found feeling your love and and sometimes a lust for love and those type things and they get excited about the wrong thing but true love is agape love now we understand that god in the beginning was called elohim because he had nothing to worship him he was a self-existent one he was that great fountain of love the great fountain of love amen but out of that great fountain god had attributes that he wanted to express so god created angels and angels could worship him and then he could be called god because god is the object of worship amen so here we're talking about true love amen true love was manifested to us in the form of jesus christ coming in the flesh so we saw love expressed and manifested to us amen we saw what god was who amen we saw god in in human form amen we saw amen the attributes amen of what god was saying to us and he was expressing we could see it being demonstrated and manifested in our midst so we thank god for true love now all the many times jesus amen perhaps when he uh took the courts and tied them together and whipping the people out the temple and perhaps it didn't look like true love amen so sometimes when god is doing certain things amen because people think the love is always amen something that amen they have conjured up in their own imaginationary mind he meant people want love amen they want somebody to care about them they want somebody to you know know feel their pain and understand their hurt and to know amen the confidence in their sorrow amen they need somebody that can understand amen what they are going through in this life so they want that they want that love they want somebody they meant that can understand and can take them and lift the burdens of life they need true love but the only one that could give them give it to them amen is jesus christ because he's the essence of love god is love amen because without god you cannot have true love praise god amen you can love your wife you can love your children you can love your family amen some people love their children so much and so even when their children were wrong amen they'll take up form they would not let them amen get uh corrected they love them so much so they were they were they're standing the gap no no no no don't correct my child that's true that's that's supposed to be true love uh and so sometimes true love amen people get confused i love my child so much to you know you know i i don't want i don't don't don't don't mess with go to school tell the teacher this is my child and sometimes it's difficult amen because they it's their own kind of love they're that they're doing it in you know in a protective love sometimes we try to protect amen sometimes we have to just understand amen how to love because it's not in the nature of man to have true love yeah amen it's not in the nature sometimes we have love for our family love for husband love for wife love for children love you know for one another but sometimes that love can be tainted amen it could be somewhat amen blind love sometimes it could be a love that amen we love those that jesus i mean the word said we love those that love us we love those that you know seem to care about us and so we care about them amen and we all caught up in that uh uh fashion we all caught up like that sometimes they meant sometimes you know if people don't care about you then you seem you don't care about them it seems to be that way and and but sometimes the person that cares about you the most amen could be blinding you amen sometimes the person you think to love you the most amen could be the worst thing for you because isaiah won the steward that he had a close friend azad amen it was a king amen and he and isaiah was a prophet but isaiah was blinded by uh ozzie and he said in the year king us i died i saw the lord amen he could not see god because he was so busy looking at us eye and sometimes it's things of us is in our way that we cannot see the lord amen but when amen we allow those things amen to move out the way sometimes god has to move our best friend sometimes god has to move amen mother or father a sister brother sometimes god has to move things out the way amen in order for you to see him true love the kind of love that said when the father and mother forsake me then the lord will take me amen god love compasses that of a mother or father so can't nobody love you like god amen so father mother could leave you but god said i never leave you and i'll never forsake you i'll be with you always even unto the end of the world so you want somebody that's going to be there for you always sometimes mother and father in their best efforts sometimes they can't be there in your most difficult times sometimes in the times when you have to make major decisions sometimes you you feel so distant that you cannot express or talk about it you made your troubles to nobody but god says amen he'll be there in the time of trouble he's a present help i'm talking about true love a god that really loves you that he's a present help in a time of trouble amen so the prophet of god talks about a perfect love you say it'll take perfect love and talk about going beyond the curtains of time and that beyond the curtains of time this is perfect love amen and i i and perfect love and when we re read corinthians 13 you know sometimes people can do all kind of things to show that they are worshiping god and that they love god he said do i restore all my goods to feed the poor yet i have not charity it profits me nothing amen we can do all kinds of things do i get my body to be birthed and i have not charity it profits me nothing we can do a lot of things to show amen that we really love but amen that could be you know god sees the deep part sometimes we're doing things and sometimes we have motives and objectives why we do certain things amen see sometimes amen god will direct us to do something amen that is not amen it might be out of the norm amen when god love amen it'll reach amen and it'll cause you to respond and react in such a way amen that is not normal you you realize you're going beyond yourself amen it's it's a leading of the spirit of god it meant god is in control not something that just in affection just in conscience and memory it's not something amen that uh is emotional in your spirit amen it's something that's deeper than that it's the word of god leading you by the holy ghost are you with me so here we talking about amen how to be led by the spirit of love how to be led by the spirit of god amen and it it takes us humble in ourselves amen it's not trying to show somebody that i care about you it's not trying to amen express you know it's something that's down inside of you amen that god knows so his he says this is what i love let's go to first timothy i mean second timothy three second timothy three love brother and sister sometimes we battle we battle we have walls within ourselves amen and sometimes you have to ask the question do i have true love am i phony am i just a hypocrite do i really love my enemy do i really care about the lowest of the lowest do i just care about my family and my friends sometimes we have to check ourselves and check our spirit out and see how deep our love goes said on last night our love god to love is deeper amen then they need depths then any length then any height it's so deep amen it cannot be measured by the depths it's so wide it cannot be mentioned amen oh god it's god's love it's so extremely that we cannot express the essence of god's love amen true love we cannot express it now that kind of love that can get down inside of us amen and god can express its attributes out of us amen god could come down in us and get release himself and able to express himself through his bride amen god amen expressing agape love something the world knows nothing of praise god family they don't know about it husband sometimes wouldn't know but god can do something in you that's beyond measure something about the young the man and his friends and they were drinking and all and they were talking he said i know a christian and he's talking about his wife and so they went to the house and they play he played drunk and he started doing all types of stuff perhaps breaking up dishes and doing all kind of stuff and she said she kept him you know just singing and taking i want to walk there somewhat i don't and and the man was doing all kind of stuff and showing his friend that he had a wife that was really a true christian you know and sometimes and she was the epitome of a true christian that had a god pay love not only loved her husband amen but she was she was uh uh uh uh uh bound to the to the word she had agape love that began can take all the breaking up the dishes so he perhaps cursed and re-sand just to try to get her upset but he could not shake her perhaps she was just singing much jesus by the cross alone and all the world go free amen there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross with me amen amen and as those men looked at that and saw that kind of love they were convicted the husband was convicted because he was trying to show them something he knew he had a jewel if you were tested and you were trying how would you come would you pass that test amen if your husband came home and he was raising all kinds of sand throw his clothes and it would flow and should kick his shoes off and you know give me something to eat and when you gave him something throw it out oh lord go get me something else and you throw it out again lord have mercy see by the grace of god god has every one of us in his hand sometimes god do some things to bring out character to bring out the kind of character that he's looking for amen god let you go through certain places and certain things in life to bring out character amen that you might show overcoming victory amen that you've overcome something that god has placed him at the token in your life they met the baptism of the holy ghost is down in your soul amen love goes deep ii thessalonians 2 and 7. it says for the mystery of iniquity do it already work only he did not let will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power signs and line oneness and with all deceivedness of unrighteousness in them that what because they receive not what see i'm just not talking about you know some people can try to love one another but they don't love the truth they can be good church people and good so to speak we understand look like they're good christians but when it comes down to the word test they don't love the truth are you with me you can have individuals amen and i'm not talking about just denominationalism well i'm just not talking about you know uh per i'm talking about individuals i'm talking about you and i must examine ourselves and see whether or not we're in the faith do we have true love praise god uh only are we just expressing amen uh that kind of feeling your love is it that god paid love does it go beyond amen go beyond the norm amen amen you treat people like you you want to be treated but sometimes the person is not going to treat you that way sometimes they're going to hate you without a cause they dislike you because of your color your skin sometimes they dislike you because of your educational standing sometimes they dislike you because you're not educated are you with me sometimes they just dislike you because they just think that something is wrong with you they haven't they conjured up something in their mind maybe the devil whistled something in their ear and they said i don't like her never met you never had a conversation but i don't like her she thinks she's up i don't like him oh i can't stand it why look at she thinks she's up she look what kind of caught you drive you see the house they live in ah they think they're here they think they are pretty really are you with me so so you know and sometimes that may be true but that's not your problem that don't give you reason to dislike them or to hate them i have an attitude against them it doesn't matter what other you are as an individual responsible for your own soul are you up man so you're responsible amen for what god has given you if he's given you a god paid love you are responsible to let god express himself through you true love doesn't matter sometimes we the bible says pray for love praise how cast is not what we're intimidated because by certain people because of their social standard education understanding we are intimidated we have fear but perfect love catches out fear but fear has told me it is of the devil god has no respect a person are you a man so it's easy amen to to try amen within ourselves to understand amen who god chooses amen to bless amen because he told baal of whom god blessed cain no man cursed and whom god cursed can't no man bless if god blesses your brother your sister or son your or somebody down the street don't worry about it god can bless who here whoever he will whether they are sinner whether they're saying or whether they what are they god bless them thank god for them don't you wonder oh they you know no no no you know jealousy is cruel as a grave isn't that right praise god it says with all power and with all this deceivingness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the what the love of the one i'm talking about true love you know people have a problem with loving the truth jesus said i'm the way to what truth and the life they meant true love true love is stood right there before them and they they spit on him they call him visible the devil somebody called you busy bull good might call you a devil i'm a christian i'm not trying to tell you what you're calling yeah you're christian i'm saying no no no they call invisible all the power of heaven and earth was in him he was god in flesh yet they they call him devil they call him visible but he was the expression of true love he taught us how to love one another he taught us how to love god because god is his word receive not the love of the truth that they might be what say many people are not saved because they don't love truth they just you fall in love with the lie the love not the truth that they might be saved for this cause god shall send them what that they should believe or what yeah yeah sometimes we want what we want and we don't want what god has chose for us what god want to give us we don't want it we think we know better than god this is what i want and and god if you don't give it to me then i i i don't want what you want to give me i want what i want and see if you don't give me what i want then i ain't going to serve you see i prayed and asked god for this and i asked god to do that night's got to do that and god did not do it so but i i i'm upset i'm mad at god why you mad at god god has already done enough for you when he died on the cross shedding his blood he's already done enough he went to hell for you rose again and he said i give you eternal life that's enough praise god if he gives you eternal life all these other things oh not to bother you one thing about it i got to mention amen i got i i got eternal life amen praise god i got god he's proved his love to me he saved me out of a miserable life of sin he he met he oh god i see so many people on their way to hell but you're on your way to heaven you've got god on the inside well thank you jesus you got a god that cares about you amen god that fire praise god in your darkest hour he's there praise god hallelujah he's proved his love he's an old time god what a friend we have in jesus all our sins in greece he bear what a privilege that we have that we can carry everything to god in prayer are you a fan oh jesus a strong illusion that you should believe a lie that they might be damned who believe not the what see true love is to love the truth when you don't love truth god can give you a delusion you can you can make what you want to do all right and justified before god this is what i want to do amen and this is what god told me to do this is what i i choose to do and god is blessing what i do you know i'm saying it's your choice how do we know the will of god how do we know what's true it's the word when we're outside of the bondage of the word and we're doing something contrary to the word amen it doesn't matter how good you feel and it doesn't matter how blessed you think you are it don't matter what you think you've achieved when you're out of the word you're out of the will of god amen and private god said you're trying to do god of service without it being his will are you with me so we must stay in the word of god he said if you abide in me and my word abiding you then you ask what you will are you up man and just because it meant the rain falls on the jets and on just just because it's raining non-blessings on you amen it doesn't mean amen amen praise god amen in first corinthians 13 amen do i have faith that i can remove mountains and i have not charity prophets mean nothing amen somewhere i'm not in the word because amen i don't love the truth i don't love the word you cannot go past the way you better go all the way man should not live by bread alone but bye and if you love me keep my commandments amen don't just keep it what you what's what what's all right with you and what you feel is good what you feel like amen i want to keep this with this this ain't for me the word of god you must eat the whole book eat the whole row just don't even part you know just eat the whole thing praise god that they that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pledge and what unrighteousness and see that that's what happens see man people have pleasure and unrighteousness that's i did with second test alone you should didn't i didn't i didn't never go to the temperature yo y'all got me okay it's time to second timothy 5. i said it but didn't go to i mean second timothy three excuse me second timothy's three no it's not no no five okay it says second timothy 3 just know also that in the last days purdue's time should come for men shall be what lovers of their own self see the problem is true love is not to love yourself own self it's a love god are you with me but we know that men love themselves and that's the hindrance because we love ourselves amen instead of loving god so we have another one that we're worshiping and a lot of young folks are going in saying they're god i'm god amen so men love themselves and love pleasure amen lovers of their own selves covetousness bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and unthankful and unholy when you love yourself it it causes you to respond in negative ways amen towards your parents towards things because amen if you can't have it it's selfish you want it it's mine give it to me if i can't have what i want then i'm rebellious and then i i go against the word if my flesh says i want this amen i say i want that and if i can't have it amen that i'm not coming to church i'm not going to sing anymore i'm not going to preach anymore i'm not going i'm not going to do what i got to have what i want praise god sometimes god amen he resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble amen we need humble spirits we need broken and contrite spirit we need to know the will of god amen not for you know somebody else but for my life lord i i must have my motives and reject this right i must know even what i'm what i'm doing it pleases god not that it pleases me but it please god sometimes we want to please ourselves we don't want to please god remember true love is to please god not ourselves amen jesus said i come to do the will of my father amen amen he said not my will but let your will be done but sometimes we amen exercise our will and god allows us to do our will and it's not even his will amen but his perfect will and his perfect love amen praise god is it it's perfect word are you with me so god will is his word amen and sometimes we get confused amen because we want to do a thing so bad and we desire we thank god he said when i'm oh ways please the lord he'll give you the desires of your heart amen but you got to please him first amen seek you first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will be added amen and god wants you to even yield to him and let him have preeminence let him have control of your life god i want your will to be done even if it hurts me even if i have to suffer amen god i'd rather suffer persecution i'd rather go through things amen jesus went through the agony of the cross amen but he did it for us brother and sister what we are doing we're not doing it for ourselves we're doing it for one another amen we're showing amen god amen lord i love my brother i love my sister amen i don't want to hurt them i don't want to hurt my wife i don't want to hurt my children amen i love them lord i want to bless be a blessing praise god it's all about being a blessing how can i be a blessing lord use me to be a blessing not a curse not a hindrance lord i want to be a blessing amen but not my amen i can't be a blessing outside of the word i got to be bound to the word and i got to make sure that i'm not seeking vain glory i'm talking my true love amen something to edit for myself something to lift me up something to take me where god don't want me to be lord but give me your humble spirit praise god let me forsake myself let me forsake all to follow you lord because i need you more needs you more than anything amen i can't leave myself i need you to leave me and you'll lead me in your word because i don't know what to do oh god i don't know how to go in and now so lord god you you lead me you god you take control that's what i want god's will not my will but let your will be done praise god amen as we approach the 10th meeting let's let god will be done let's get an attitude lord get me out of the way amen lord let's pray that your will be done souls might come to the kingdom of god hallelujah people might be converted amen that they will come to know the love of god they can pass his own knowledge and understand that's what we want perfect love we want amen true love amen we don't want feeling your love and we don't want hey brother sister i love you i love you i love you praise god praise god you sometimes actions speak louder than words sometimes you don't have to open your mouth and nobody has to
