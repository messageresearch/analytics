[39:05] verse and when you got it say amen
[39:09] amen that's a little weak we going to
[39:14] wait John CH 5 verse one it reads and
[39:18] after this there was a feast of the Jews
[39:20] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and there
[39:24] and now there is at Jerusalem by the
[39:26] Sheep Market upon pole which is called
[39:28] in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having
[39:31] five porches in these lay a great
[39:34] multitude of important folk of blind and
[39:36] halt
[39:38] withered waiting for the moving of the
[39:40] water for an angel went down at a
[39:43] certain season into the pool and
[39:46] troubled the water whosoever then first
[39:49] after the troubling of the water stepped
[39:52] in was made whole of whatsoever disease
[39:55] he had and a certain man was there which
[39:58] had infirmity for 38 years when Jesus
[40:02] saw him lie and knew that he had been
[40:05] now a long time in that case he saith
[40:09] unto him wil thou be made whole the
[40:13] impotent man answered him sir I have no
[40:17] man when the water is troubled to put me
[40:20] into the pool but while I am coming
[40:24] another step is down before me and Jesus
[40:27] said sayith unto him rise take up thy
[40:29] bed and walk and immediately the man was
[40:33] made whole and took up his bed and
[40:36] walked and on the same day was the
[40:38] Sabbath amen God bless the reading of
[40:40] his word you may be
[40:43] seated this morning I'd like to speak on
[40:45] a little topic that I entitled your day
[40:48] of Victory your day of Victory when you
[40:52] read this story you see that this man
[40:53] was troubled for 38 years he had been in
[40:57] the same situation for 38 years but one
[41:00] day Jesus came and stopped by one day
[41:03] Jesus came and he heard his cry he heard
[41:06] his prayer it didn't matter how long he
[41:08] was there his healing was going away it
[41:11] didn't matter how long he might have sat
[41:12] there he said he might have had excuses
[41:14] he said other people help they friends
[41:16] into the pool but you see he didn't need
[41:19] no help all he needed was Jesus he
[41:21] didn't need nobody else to help him all
[41:23] he had to do was wait and God came by
[41:26] and provided what he asked him for it
[41:28] was his Day of Victory it was his day
[41:31] that he was going to get delivered it
[41:32] was his day that God was going to set
[41:34] him free he didn't know when that day
[41:36] was coming but he was in the right place
[41:38] at the right time you can't get Victory
[41:41] unless you're in the right place at the
[41:43] right time and when you in the right
[41:45] place at the right time it's going to be
[41:47] your day of Victory it's going to be
[41:49] your moment of Victory doesn't matter
[41:51] how long it took but it was the right
[41:53] place at the right time and I said I
[41:57] wrote something down I said sometimes
[41:58] your Victory is in letting go amen he
[42:01] had to get out of the place that he had
[42:04] to worry about this one helping that one
[42:06] he had to worry about this one helping
[42:08] this one get in the pool before him he
[42:10] let all that go and he took his healing
[42:13] when Jesus said rise up and walk he
[42:14] didn't question it he got up and he
[42:16] walked he didn't he didn't wonder
[42:18] whether this was it or whether it not
[42:20] was he took it by faith and said this is
[42:22] mine This Is My Day of Victory and I'm
[42:25] going to step forth and rejoice it's my
[42:27] day of Victory he didn't care what day
[42:29] of the week it was he didn't care who
[42:31] was around him he didn't care about
[42:33] everybody else that was sick that was
[42:35] sitting there he said this is my Day of
[42:37] Victory amen and I started to think
[42:39] about it and I said how many times do we
[42:42] pass up our Victory because we looking
[42:44] at all the other things how many times
[42:46] do we pass up Victory because we looking
[42:49] at everyone else around us and expecting
[42:51] them to go with
[42:52] us it wasn't for everybody but it was
[42:55] for him amen it wasn't for his friend
[42:58] that might have been I'm sure after 38
[43:00] years he had made some
[43:02] friends after 38 years he had made some
[43:05] some people that he had seen get healed
[43:07] and maybe they came back and checked on
[43:08] them but he wasn't worried about them in
[43:11] that moment it was for him and he said
[43:14] you know what it's time for me to rise
[43:16] up and walk it's time for me to go forth
[43:18] and step into my victory it's time for
[43:20] me to realize that this is my day that
[43:23] the Lord has made and I can rejoice and
[43:25] be glad in it see he was was happy that
[43:27] that was his day cuzz he had been there
[43:30] and he realized that this is something
[43:32] that it doesn't matter how long it take
[43:34] when that angel troubled that water I
[43:36] could get in and I could be healed but
[43:39] when Jesus stopped by I don't have to
[43:41] wait on the water to be trouble when
[43:44] Jesus comes by I don't have to wait on
[43:46] seeing the water Rumble I don't have to
[43:48] wait on the others all I can do is take
[43:50] what God has given me and I can go for
[43:52] it and say this is my day and it might
[43:55] not be your testimony but I can say this
[43:57] is my day it may not be your testimony
[44:00] but I can say this is the day that God
[44:02] has given me for victory and I can go
[44:06] forward and I can shout the victory
[44:08] because I know God is going to do what
[44:09] he said he was going to do I know that
[44:11] God has given me what I asked him for I
[44:14] know that God is moving what I asked him
[44:16] for and it didn't matter how long it's
[44:18] going to take but I know God has done it
[44:20] cuz this is my Day of
[44:22] Victory I thought about it and I and I
[44:25] said that
[44:27] I was reading in Exodus 14-14 it said
[44:30] the Lord shall fight for you and ye
[44:32] shall hold your peace amen I I read that
[44:35] scripture and I had to read it again
[44:37] because I said I read the Bible but
[44:39] sometimes it hit different I said the
[44:41] Lord shall fight for you and ye shall
[44:43] hold your peace am Exodus 14-4 and I
[44:47] thought about I said sometimes you over
[44:49] there fighting and you ain't holding
[44:52] your
[44:53] peace you over there saying this and
[44:55] that but you not holding your peace the
[44:57] scripture said the Lord shall fight for
[44:59] you and ye shall hold your peace which
[45:02] means sometimes you got to be silent
[45:04] when God is working amen you can't tell
[45:06] nobody when God is working you can't
[45:09] utter the prayer cuz the devil might
[45:10] hear it and mess it up you can't even
[45:12] tell nobody what you done told God in
[45:14] your secret room he said the Lord shall
[45:17] fight for you and you shall hold your
[45:18] peace and I said sometimes you got to
[45:21] cast all your cares on him because he
[45:23] cares for you and when you cast them all
[45:25] down you can see the Lord fighting for
[45:27] you you can see the Lord do what you
[45:29] asked him to do and to see him work and
[45:32] I said see this is your day of Victory
[45:35] but do you believe
[45:37] it all it takes is you believ in it and
[45:41] just because the Mountain Ain't move
[45:43] ain't doesn't mean that you didn't speak
[45:45] to the
[45:46] mountain it didn't mean that the
[45:48] mountain wasn't moving just cuz you
[45:50] didn't see it move just because it
[45:53] didn't happen before your eyes didn't
[45:55] mean that mountain wasn't moving
[45:57] you never know it could be a grain of
[45:59] sand by a grain of sand but when the
[46:01] grain of Sands moved something was
[46:03] taking place something was out of the
[46:05] ordinary was going on because there was
[46:08] something that you spoke and you
[46:09] believed and God was doing the work and
[46:12] when God decide that he wants to
[46:13] complete the work he will complete the
[46:15] work cuz I can tell you God Is Never Too
[46:18] Late God is never too late he's never
[46:22] too late in what he's going to do and
[46:24] when he does it you can't profess that
[46:27] you did it when God does a thing you
[46:29] can't say that it was something that
[46:31] this one or that one did all you know is
[46:33] that I thank God I thank God for what
[46:38] you done and said you can't deliver me
[46:41] but God can you can't save me but God
[46:44] can you can't heal me but God can and
[46:47] when you get to that reality things
[46:49] start changing for you cuz you know that
[46:51] all my Help Cometh From The Lord all my
[46:54] help I can look up to the hills from
[46:57] cometh my help cuz my help comes from
[46:58] the
[46:59] Lord I was reading reading something he
[47:02] said don't despise where God has got you
[47:06] but serve your purpose there's coming a
[47:09] great Victory Day one of these days
[47:11] where the Battle Is Over amen I said
[47:14] sometimes we think about we despise
[47:16] where we
[47:18] are we despise where we are cuz we think
[47:22] well we should be here or we should be
[47:24] there or I shouldn't I should be this
[47:26] place or that place and I and I said
[47:29] something to someone recently and I was
[47:31] I was talking and and we was going
[47:32] through some things I said sometimes we
[47:34] always looking back to where God did
[47:37] things in the
[47:38] past because it's a momento it's
[47:41] something that we can look at and see
[47:42] the salvation of the Lord the children
[47:44] of Israel always could go back to Egypt
[47:47] but if they always looking at Egypt they
[47:49] would never cross Jordan they always
[47:51] looking at the miracle of the Red Sea
[47:54] they would never expect the Jordan the
[47:56] crossover Jordan but in Jordan it was
[47:59] greater there was a blessed Land There
[48:01] was a land that was flowing with milk
[48:02] and honey where God had defeated all
[48:04] their enemies all they had to do was
[48:06] believe and said you always sometimes
[48:10] you despise the where God has got you
[48:13] but realize that God got you right there
[48:15] amen and you wouldn't be there if God
[48:18] didn't have his hand over your life and
[48:20] had put you there and if he put you
[48:23] there he had a reason for you to be
[48:25] there he had a reason for you to go
[48:27] through it and because he wanted to
[48:29] build you for a greater purpose see he
[48:32] can't give you a greater purpose if you
[48:34] don't have Victory you can't testify if
[48:37] you don't have Victory you can't tell
[48:39] nobody how good God is if you never
[48:42] experienced how good God is if you never
[48:45] experienced what God has done that's
[48:47] where the testimony comes from when God
[48:50] brings you through and you can testify
[48:52] and look back and say it was nobody but
[48:54] God that could bring me through what
[48:56] I've been through and I can count up the
[48:58] victories that God has given
[49:01] me and sometimes you have to pray for
[49:04] others that they can overcome you have
[49:06] to stand in the Gap that they can
[49:08] overcome But realize that you know what
[49:10] sometime you got to let down those
[49:12] burdens to God you got to come to the
[49:15] cross and say Lord I give you these
[49:17] things otherwise they will weigh down
[49:19] your journey amen they will weigh you
[49:21] down and you over here carrying burdens
[49:24] that aren't yours and when you realize
[49:27] that and the Revelation comes to you
[49:29] that Lord in order for me to get Victory
[49:31] I got to lay some things down amen
[49:34] you'll go to God real quick real
[49:37] quick because you don't you know what
[49:39] freedom is you've experienced what God
[49:42] has done and you know that these are
[49:44] things that I I I don't want to deal
[49:46] with and continue to carry on with me
[49:48] for the rest of my life and sometimes
[49:51] you don't know the weights that you
[49:52] carry until you go to God and say Lord
[49:54] take the weights away yeah and God open
[49:57] your eyes that you may see Lord I was
[49:59] carrying a whole lot of stuff I was
[50:02] caring a whole lot of stuff that I was
[50:05] supposed to say casting all my cares on
[50:08] you but I I cast them down and I picked
[50:10] them right back up when I
[50:13] left said the the hard the easy thing is
[50:15] to cast them down but do you pick them
[50:17] back
[50:18] up see you ain't got Victory then you
[50:21] just picked up your problem with
[50:23] you you got a feeling and a joy that
[50:26] happened for a moment but when you get
[50:28] true
[50:29] Victory it it's something different when
[50:31] you get true Victory and when you know
[50:33] that you not going to go through that no
[50:35] more and if you do when the Devil Comes
[50:38] you got something to stand on and say
[50:40] nuh-uh devil this ain't for me and I'm
[50:42] giving it right back to you see that's
[50:44] what victory is Victory a doesn't mean
[50:47] that you're not going to be tested again
[50:50] Victory doesn't mean that the trial
[50:51] ain't going to come again it means that
[50:53] when the trial comes I can shout and
[50:55] thank God that this devil is not going
[50:57] to attack me no more devil you fought me
[51:00] yesterday but you ain't going to win
[51:02] today that's what victory means but you
[51:05] know when you get that Revelation then
[51:08] you will understand what true Victory is
[51:10] said the victory ain't just a feeling
[51:12] it's not an emotion it's something deep
[51:14] down in the inside where you know that
[51:16] God has done the work and no matter how
[51:19] hard the devil tried he can't take me
[51:21] back to where I once was he can't take
[51:24] me back to bondage he can't take me back
[51:26] to being under the Philistines he can't
[51:29] they can't conquer me no more cuz God
[51:31] gave me
[51:33] Victory see that's Victory amen and when
[51:36] you decide that you want it you can go
[51:39] to God and say Lord I need Victory say
[51:42] sometimes you got to go to God and say
[51:43] Lord I need peace you got to go to God
[51:46] and say Lord I need peace and you don't
[51:49] know how that peace is coming but you
[51:50] said Lord I need peace and I'm telling
[51:53] you when you ask God for peace sometimes
[51:55] God will give you peace yeah but it may
[51:57] not be how you expected it to
[51:59] come boy Lord Jesus it may not be how
[52:03] you expected it to come but when it
[52:05] comes you'll realize it was exactly what
[52:07] I prayed for amen yes it was exactly
[52:10] what I prayed
[52:12] for sometimes you praying prayers and
[52:14] God be answering the prayers I said man
[52:16] I got to um be careful what to pray
[52:19] for because when God start answering you
[52:23] realize that you got to be specific with
[52:25] your prayers
[52:28] and the more God work on you and touch
[52:30] you and and realize you get real
[52:32] specific with the prayers because you
[52:34] want God to make sure that Lord not my
[52:37] will but thy will be done and you start
[52:39] to praying different you start to come
[52:41] in even when you call people names you
[52:43] start to pray IND different Lord I want
[52:45] your will to be done not mine when you
[52:48] start to praying for other people you
[52:50] start to say Lord I want you to have
[52:52] your way in their life not mine I could
[52:54] imagine this and that and this and that
[52:56] but Lord I want you to give them Victory
[52:58] when you realize that you put them in
[53:00] God's hands and you put them in God's
[53:03] hands and you leave them in God's hands
[53:06] right you expecting the work to happen
[53:08] you expecting God to do what you asked
[53:10] him to do and you left them there you
[53:13] ain't worried about it you ain't crying
[53:15] about it no more you ain't you trusting
[53:17] God and say Lord when you do the work I
[53:19] can testify that you've done it and I I
[53:22] don't even have to see it but I know
[53:24] that you going to do it
[53:26] amen see that's what it takes when you
[53:28] get that type of Victory boy it allow
[53:30] you to shout all over the place it allow
[53:32] you to be so free and say thank you
[53:34] Jesus ain't nothing can hinder you or
[53:36] stop you from believing in what God can
[53:40] do it said it says and it seems like the
[53:43] Christian Life if a fellow is not
[53:45] absolutely centered on Christ the
[53:48] Christian life seems like holds so many
[53:51] disappointments sometimes people are
[53:53] disappointed with their Christian life
[53:55] but they're not living like a
[53:59] Christian so how can you be mad at God
[54:02] when you ain't doing what God asked you
[54:04] to
[54:05] do how can you be upset with God not
[54:08] doing things for you when you ain't
[54:10] doing what God asked you to
[54:13] do I don't understand it cuz God a ask
[54:17] for
[54:18] much he didn't ask for much he just said
[54:20] give me give me your life and then he
[54:22] said if you get in trouble just lift up
[54:24] your hand and I'll lift you out that's
[54:26] all he asked for he said some people it
[54:29] seems like the Christian Life is if it's
[54:32] not centered on Christ seems like it
[54:35] holds so many
[54:37] disappointments but those
[54:39] disappointments are God's Divine God's
[54:42] Divine will happening for
[54:45] us even with all the disappointments it
[54:48] was God's will divine will happening for
[54:52] us yes God to take you through things
[54:55] that you never thought or imagine you
[54:57] would go through but it was his Divine
[55:01] will for it to happen to
[55:04] you and said now it don't seem like it
[55:07] would be it would be that but it's God's
[55:10] way of doing things he let us hit this
[55:14] hit the river to see what we'll
[55:17] do God will let you hit the river just
[55:20] to see what you going to do God will let
[55:22] you run into a brick wall to see what
[55:24] you going to do God let let you and
[55:27] sometimes he knew the brick wall was
[55:28] coming and he tried to warn you that the
[55:30] brick wall was coming but he still let
[55:32] you
[55:34] go cuz some things you can avoid and
[55:37] Escape because people done told you and
[55:39] they warned you and God sent people in
[55:40] your life to testify and to tell you but
[55:43] when you go through it it was still
[55:44] God's will for you to do it if you were
[55:47] his child sometimes he got to take you
[55:49] through the fiery trials and a fiery
[55:52] furnace the Hebrew children didn't get
[55:54] to escape going the Hebrew boys get to
[55:56] escape going in that
[55:58] furnace it was just that God was going
[56:00] to show up and they weren going to be
[56:02] burned they didn't get to escape it
[56:05] those around them died because of the
[56:07] heat but they didn't get to escape it
[56:09] God had to take them through
[56:11] it and I and I and I was thought about I
[56:14] said you know
[56:17] Jesus Jesus gave up The Ghost and he
[56:20] died for us so that all of us could be
[56:23] saved you think that was easy but that
[56:26] was his moment of victory for us that
[56:29] was when he won he defeated death Hell
[56:31] In The Grave Just For Us just for me and
[56:34] you he did all of that that was the Day
[56:36] of Victory and I can always turn back
[56:38] and say that was my day of Victory cuz I
[56:40] was there when he died on the cross for
[56:42] me I was there and he shed his blood for
[56:45] me it was my sins that was on that cross
[56:48] when he was getting whipped and he was
[56:50] getting beat and those Thrones of they
[56:53] was pushing them down on his head those
[56:54] were my sins those were were my mistakes
[56:57] those were the time where I knew better
[56:58] and God G gave me grace and mercy that I
[57:01] can still live and breathe and that he
[57:04] gave me those moments to repent that was
[57:06] me on that cross that God died
[57:09] for if you don't understand that or if
[57:12] you haven't realized that today can be
[57:14] your day of victory that you can turn
[57:17] around and say Lord your blood was shed
[57:18] for me Lord when you died you died for
[57:21] me amen not anybody else I can see my
[57:24] sins on that cross and it wasn't greater
[57:27] than your sins or less or higher or more
[57:29] than your sins and I can't judge you
[57:31] because I have to be judged by who what
[57:33] the way that I judge but I can't judge
[57:36] you because I'm right there with you I'm
[57:39] no greater than anybody
[57:42] else just because this person may have
[57:45] done a heinous crime and all you did was
[57:47] told a lie which one of y'all going to
[57:49] get into heaven if you don't get it
[57:52] straight neither one of y'all
[57:56] because you haven't come to the blood
[57:58] where Jesus where the Lord doesn't see
[58:00] your sins and doesn't see you he sees
[58:03] Jesus he sees him standing in the Gap
[58:05] and he said that's my son and whom I'm
[58:07] well
[58:08] pleased see that's what you want to hear
[58:12] but just because you think that I live a
[58:14] semide decent life I'm
[58:16] okay just because I don't do this that
[58:19] and the other I'm okay I only did a
[58:20] little bit of sin and they did a whole
[58:22] lot it ain't that ain't the measure we
[58:26] we all going to get judged by the same
[58:27] thing when we come there and we see the
[58:30] Lord he going to say what have you done
[58:32] with the life I gave
[58:34] youen what have you done but today you
[58:38] can get victory over everything that you
[58:40] may face everything that you may go
[58:42] through everything every trial and
[58:44] tribulation that may come God can give
[58:46] you victory over no matter how hard it
[58:50] is no matter how difficult it may seem
[58:53] it might have been things that you
[58:54] fighting that ain't even your thing it
[58:55] was generational
[58:57] things and God can give you Victory
[58:59] today God can give you victory over that
[59:02] the generational things that you have to
[59:05] go to God and say Lord this ain't even
[59:07] my
[59:08] fight but I'm dealing with it because of
[59:11] generational things I had to go to God
[59:14] and say Lord give me victory over this
[59:17] whether it's mind battles whether it's
[59:19] it's things that people can physically
[59:21] see you know the Unseen things are worse
[59:23] than the things that you can't see amen
[59:26] bless him Lord the things that you fight
[59:28] in the middle of the night that nobody
[59:30] knows about sometimes those are harder
[59:32] than the things that people can see amen
[59:35] yes because nobody knows the struggle
[59:37] that go that you have in your mind but
[59:40] when God knows everything and he saw you
[59:43] and he sees you and he knows what you go
[59:46] through I may not know sister brother
[59:48] mama or daddy may not know but God knows
[59:52] and when he can come by and give you
[59:54] victory over that
[59:56] and when he gives you victory over that
[59:58] there's a whole lot of things that may
[1:00:00] go away because God Gave You Victory
[1:00:02] amen amen but the question is do you
[1:00:04] want
[1:00:06] it Victory could be given to you but do
[1:00:09] you want it it was a gift am God just

[1:01:33] got prayed for cuz he believed it wasn't
[1:01:35] until he was sitting in a barber chair
[1:01:37] and the barber was like you said you
[1:01:39] went there and got prayed for and you
[1:01:41] still ain't healed that God had to be a
