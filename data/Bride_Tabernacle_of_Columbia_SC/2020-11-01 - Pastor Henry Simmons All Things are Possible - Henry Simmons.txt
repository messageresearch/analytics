we look at the book of mark i'm glad to be in the number one more time so glad to be in the normal one more time one more time kel's shaking his head i don't know that so glad to be in the number okay well mark 9 and 17. and one of the multitude answers said master i have bought unto thee my son which had a dumb spirit and whatsoever he taketh him he teared him and he form it and gnashes with his teeth and pined it away and i speak to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not and he answered him said oh faithfulness generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they bought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tareth him and he fell on the ground and wallet informing he asked his father how long is it all ago [Music] since this came unto him and he said of a child then and of times it has cast him into the fire and into the water to destroy him but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believe it may god bless you towards you may be seated [Music] when we get desperate enough jesus will come on the scene brother and sister when we get desperate enough jesus will come on the scene i said this man was not satisfied with his results just prayer wasn't enough for though the disciples were had their ministry and but this man would not give up on his son the disciples said he may have done all they could do and uh seemed like there was a little doubt in the man's confidence he said if you can do anything i want to talk to you this morning about all things are possible all things are possible and with the little team the devil is defeated the devil is defeated if thou can believe if you can believe the prophet of god to the angel left like that song only believe all things are possible if he locked it then i believe he likes he loves it now all things are possible amen we questioned the ability of god for the man they met came to jesus but he doubted the ability of god sometimes we question god's ability we are not certain that god can do it and we ask the question god if you can help me if you can help me help me man said if you can will you help me please there's no f irons and buts about it are you with me i don't need to question god's ability i don't need to doubt whether god can do it or not hallelujah hallelujah when i'm talking to god i know who he well hallelujah and knowing that he's god hallelujah i don't have to worry about a thing i don't have to address him in doubt when i addressed him out to know already that i'm talking about a god that got it all in control i'm talking about a god that got all power in his hand oh yes he he he he he knows him from the beginning oh god what hallelujah can you see that was a almost insulting to jesus ability amen to who he was they meant if we believe that he is the son of god then uh amen we all not to question his ability the woman at the well she said that amen when he said go get your husband he said she said i have none he said you said well you had five and the one that you have is not yours amen jesus amen began to identify himself amen as the messiah because he did the sign of the messiah and i want you to know this morning that amen don't question god's ability amen now jesus began to discern the intents and the thoughts of the heart he began to reach back into that woman's life and he began to pull back and identify who she was amen and uh she recognized that when the messiah come he'll do these things amen i've wondered do you recognize your who's among you do you recognize who jesus is if you can only recognize the god we serve hallelujah if you can only recognize jesus ability this morning hallelujah i believe our minds amen will be in a a certain con frame a condition i believe that uh well amen we'll understand amen that we should not be looking for what god can do amen because we know god can do all things praise god i tell you we've had enough but candidates we've had the teaching rain they meant but we need uh they met the ladder rain the former and the ladder amen i believe that we'll talk to nothing [Music] i believe we heard enough talk and enough preaching and enough teaching amen i believe it's time for dynamics amen people are coming because they're hungry and touching sir we would see jesus i believe you ought to come this morning expecting to see jesus oh yes i believe that jesus should be clearly identified [Music] well yes i i want to see jesus this morning i want to know that god is with us praise god we're not just having amen to call form a dead church they met somebody preaching a good sermon but i want to see jesus [Music] i got to have jesus i got to have the supernatural praise god all things are possible praise god if you cannot call jesus and bring him on the scene i believe you need to go somewhere and find him praise god i believe we need to search and find out where he is and when you find him amen where he is and you ought to go amen to him amen you ought not to come to the church just to hear a nice singing and nice shouting nice sermons where you ought to come expecting to see god are you with me i want to see god praise god i want to know that god is in the midst well he declined in his word when two or three are gathered in my name he promised to be here then that is why it's true that he is here praise god and if he is then what he did yesterday i said he'll do it today i gotta calm down a little bit talk to you a little bit but i uh my heart it's been troubled they met because i find that the enemy is on the attack they meant because i believe the enemy knows that god is doing something in the air that's why he's doing all these disturbing things amen and he's not letting up with all the blows and i believe that uh amen god is aligned to the attacks to come forward because god knows that there's a people that will stand up and lift up a standing against the enemy they're the people that are not ignorant of satan devices that's somebody he met that understand i'm not gonna set steal and allow the enemy ain't meant to do what he's doing somebody gonna get amen i got to get with god i got to get down to business i got to get ahold of god in a real way i got to know that his power is in my life i got to have praise god i believe somebody gonna get down to business praise god somebody gonna say lord i'm not gonna let the devil amen do the things that he's doing not in my presence hallelujah not i in my family oh god not in my house not with my children amen not with my husband not with my wife i'm not gonna set oh oh no hallelujah i said my god is real he's real in my soul amen praise god i know my god is real and i'm not gonna set steal you might be sent still and amen you might be like the disciples so amen you prayed and you prayed and nothing happened oh yes but amen bring them to jesus hallelujah glory to god hallelujah somebody amen i believe will pass that cycle amen i believe it's time amen praise god that you said amen you don't have to take them to jesus amen because greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world amen i don't want to take them to jesus i want to know that the jesus is inside of me and i got the power to cast out devils yes i do i know these signs shall follow them that believe and i don't want to they make you to bypass my house i know that my god has promised me amen in my name i'm a believer i'm a believer how

devil is defeated how many believe that amen he's defeated then don't give him no place don't give him no place in your life amen don't give him no place he's defeated let him stay where he's supposed to be well he's under my feet [Music] amen he's under my feet is he under your feet don't give him no place in your life praise god ain't no room hallelujah i'm not giving you any place in my life hallelujah praise god you're not going to come and cut oh lord come and try to take over this house amen let me read this verse and then i'm going to come to a conclusion a god good amen it said here 17 1-17 revelation and when he saw him he fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for i am the first and the last and i said don't don't be scared fear not don't fear when the devil show his ugly head and try to give you this and that don't fear don't get all excited and despondent and all the perplexed don't fear because jesus said don't fear because i'm here there's no need to fear when i'm here are you with me the thing that the devil feeds on you try to make you afraid are you with me if you're trying to hold on to something that you're afraid to lose amen but if you know reverend say you can't lose with the stuff i use well reverend i got it wrong because a lot of folks lost with the stuff they use i was in the hospital working in the hospital and sometimes i look under the mattress changing the bed and the forehead all river like this and that and next thing i know they did i said all that rubber night up under there all kind of thing with reverend nike on that and the folk die are you with me but one thing about this word praise god the devil can't kill you why amen because the stain of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law and what happened the wages of the sin is death but god has given you eternal life but the gift of god is what so you got eternal life how you gonna lose isn't that right ain't no way the devil can take you out the only thing the devil can do give you a punch and put you to sleep and you say oh thank you amen i go to sleep i'm resting for a little while amen but when the rapture come over wake up praise god when he alarm and then lord come back up coming back with him oh you wouldn't be so why shall i be afraid i can't oh last your enemy why are you sure you'll be afraid of the enemy the bible says the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death isn't that right praise god but death has already been destroyed the bible said he's abolished there and brought life and
