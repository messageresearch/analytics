all things in your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen ammen praise the lord we turn with us Amen to amen the Book of Genesis the Book of Genesis Genesis the 22nd chapter and we begin at the first verse you got to say amen amen amen praise the Lord and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abram and said unto them Abraham and he say behold here I am now that word tempt there God Don't Tempt no man the Bible say God tempted no man but a man is tempted when Liv with his own lust and entice that word is their test God tested Abraham he's testing Abraham faith amen praise God and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the MS which I will tell thee of now God is telling him to take now his only son in God's eye that's his only son uh Ishmael is not even in the picture come on somebody Ishmael is not even in the picture and God's eye Abraham only had one son and that son is Isaac cuz he is the Son Of Promise amen praise God and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and cleaved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then the third day Abraham looked up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto the young man abide ye here with the ass and I in the lab will go Yonder and worship and come again to you look at his faith he believes that he's coming back not only by himself but Isaac is coming back with him amen praise God that would take Faith to believe God and they man took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto his father unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering notice this eth verse this what we coming from and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together let us pray gracious kind Heavenly Father we have read your word now I ask you to bless it in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated we going to take a topic from there by the grace of God eternal life making the sacrifice here is a prophecy Abraham being a prophet himself he said Isaac running with a lamb at he don't know he was supposed to be the sacrifice he didn't know he was going to be the sacrifice so when he get to the place that God told him to go he asks his father where is the Lamb for the sacrifice Abraham said my son God will provide provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering amen so God said the prophecy is God won't provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and that what God did God came down to be a sacrifice to bring eternal life back to man amen see in order to get eternal life it takes a sacrifice God sacrificed everything that he was everything he is in order to bring eternal life life to me and you he made ultimate sacrifice sacrifice everything to he was in order to bring eternal life back to me and you now eternal life is not something new we had eternal life where man did inside the Garden of Eden but sin caused man to lose eternal life let's go to Genesis 3 so sin will cause you to use lose eternal life amen God man lost eternal life in the Garden of Eden when he disobeyed God's word when God told him not to eat off the tree amen he listened to his wife and he took up the tree and he brought sin and condemnation into the world Amen praise God Genesis 3 and22 amen praise the Lord so eternal life God is going to bring it back how you going to bring it back it takes a sacrifice in order to get back eternal life it takes a sacrifice God now had to give up everything that he is in order to come down and to redeem man back to himself praise God let's go to Genesis 3 amen praise the Lord amen my question tonight is this do you want eternal life amen Genesis 3 and22 and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one us to know good and evil and now let he put forth his hand and take all of the tree of life and eat and live forever see he had the opportunity right there man God didn't put him out the garden then he could have eat off the tree and he would have live forever he was created to live forever but when sin came in then he could have eat off the tree and live forever see he was created to live forever he was eternal just like God was go he was the Son of God see he could live forever but when sin came in then God had pushed him out of the garden and now God said let's put him out let he take off the tree and eat and live forever see he got eat off the tree so eternal life is not something new it's something that man had from the beginning but was lost now it takes a sacrifice to bring it back amen God willing to risk everything for for me and you he he risk everything came down himself and just took on the Flesh of man in order to bring eternal life to you amen see he sacrificed it all now he he he wasn't concerned about the the the the what what it going to take he was willing to give it all up for me and he did he gave it all up for me and you amen why cuz he want us to have what eternal life amen now a lot of people want eternal life but they're not willing to make the sacrifice in order to get it see God made the sacrifice to bring you eternal life now you willing to make the sacrifice to get eternal life see a lot of people they don't want to sacrifice nothing they want eternal life but they willing to make the sacrifice a lot of people ain't willing to make the sacrifice amen see so eternal life how do you get it amen praise God you got to get it through the word of Goden it been a mystery for ye for ages and for years man didn't understand death he didn't understand about eternal life but it was lost it was lost to man eternal life David say uh job says a man died will he live again see so man lost that revelation of eternal life but Jesus came by God's sacrifice to bring it back let's go to the book of uh Timothy 2 Timothy 1:8 praise the Lord so eternal life everybody wants it but requires a sacrifice God know it required a sacrifice that why he came and sacrificed himself cuz he know in order to bring him back something had to die in order to take the place of what happened in order to bring eternal life back he knew he had to come down himself in order to to bring it back a angel couldn't do it because there was a man that lost it for man got to bring it back it couldn't bring an angel it couldn't bring no supernatural being it had to be God himself come down in flesh cu no it had to be man goad it can be an angel it can be a spirit amen because man lost it man got to bring it back amen God came down in flesh oh Lord praise God let's go ahead to Timothy second Timothy 1 and8 amen that was God manifest In the Flesh to do what to sacrifice himself to do what to bring back eternal life to man that was God made manifest In the Flesh God Walk around on two feet amen God cried like a baby ate food amen like I walked around amen had trials and tribulation just like we go through what he came down to do to make the sacrifice cuz he want to bring back eternal life to man praise the Lord that's what he want and that we're here for tonight you not just coming to church you coming here because you want eternal life amen praise the Lord so the question is are you willing to make the sacrifice amen remember God made the sacrifice for you amen come on somebody God sacrificed everything just for you to bring you eternal life and people want and people don't want to give up nothing for God they don't want to give up nothing they want to keep on doing the way they want to do go the way they want to go but you know what what they want eternal life amen you're not going to get eternal life until you make that sacrifice amen you willing to give up anything that's in the way of you getting eternal life you willing to give it up and walk away from it whatever in your way of stopping you from getting eternal life you need to make the sacrifice I'm going to give it up because I want to live I want to be in with God at I want to be left behind in this whole evil World Hallelujah yes sir second uh Second Timothy 1 praise the Lord see we want eternal life it was a price to get eternal life a price to get it it it was a is a great price it can't even be duplicated no more amen it was a great price that was paid to bring eternal life back to man see God sacrificed it all for me and you to bring us eternal life 2 Timothy 1:8 praise the lord we want eternal life now let's let's see if we willing to make the sacrifice to give up the things that we hold dead to us amen that's why God tested Abraham see God had to test Abraham to see if Abraham is willing to give up everything in order to follow him the most dearest thing to Abraham was Isaac that's what he wanted more than anything to have a son by his wife Sarah amen not Hagi hegi that that that's that that that came through unbelief see he uh ish came through unbelief Sarah doubted what God Said and told Abraham to go and take Hagar and hegar came for he was nowhere close to what Isaac was supposed to be a wild man see couldn't be subject to the word see that will happen when you get born out of the promise of God you can't be subject to the word Israel was born out of the promise see he was born out of the promise therefore he couldn't be subject to the word see a lot of people down there trying to you can't be oh Hallelujah you cannot come to God by joining Church you got to be born again amen that's the promise you can't come to God just by coming to church and and not being born again you ought the promise and once you have the promise then you can't you won't be able to keep the word amen you you got to be you got to be in in the promise amen as Isaac was 2 Timothy 8 I mean 1 and8 get to it amen praise the Lord amen uh say be thou uh therefore uh be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the Affliction of The Gospel According to the power of God who has saved us and called with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and great which it was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ notice now who has abolished death and have brought life and immortality to light through what the gospel that's where eternal life was made manifest that man was shut off from it in the Garden of Eden Bible say God plac Cher bims amen guarden way to the tree of life anden we come down now amen those Cher bims I want to get into just you know In Too Deep not too know something deep about but you got to read the word in order to see it amen so now the cherubims are guarding the gospels those same living creatures that Ezekiel saw those same living creatures now are guarding around the gospel guarding the book of Acts cuz that's where the life is see the revelation of eternal life is brought through the gospel you can't get about just coming to church you got to come through the gospel you can't get about just being friends with the preacher you got to come through the gospel you can't get a like you got to come to where the Bible saying inernal etal life is revealed through the gospel Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life you can't get it no other way you got to come through the gospel in order to get eternal life see a lot of people think because they're friend with the preacher you think you going to get eternal life you going to be sad on that day you got to come through the gospel a lot of people think that I'm a relative with the preacher or whoever it is I'm going get eternal life no you going to be mistaken in that day you got to come through the gospel amen in order to get eternal life that's has been revealed that that eternal life is get it through the gospel and it's been revealed through Jesus Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life amen see he revealed the who we eternal life dwell at and we know that was God made manifest In the Flesh to come down and sacrifice his life to bring eternal life back to man amen that what God did he came down say I am the way the truth and the life putting the life on the line for me and you to bring us back to eternal life oh you ought to be so happy you ought to be so glad of what God did for you for me if you accept it amen am see a lot of people don't want eternal life they say they want they don't want to do what it takes to get it so the re the revelation of eternal life is only through the gospel a lot of people want to live forever they want pills they want this they want that and none of that stuff to work going to work they want to live for don't want you think somebody they don't want to die die the billionaire don't want to die he's searching for a way right now to live forever am man only way going to get it you got to come through the gospel Hallelujah all these billionaires all that money they got they can't live forever but they can live for they got to come through the gospel just like me and you they got to come through the gospel amen amen Lord to get eternal life amen not just come in church come through this gospel be do what this word say praise the Lord be born again that's right praise the Lord so if they want eternal life and don't want to do what it takes to get it amen let's go to the book of um um praise the Lord Mark the 10th chapter now it's a choice now you got a choice you don't have to take eternal life if you don't want to God gives you a choice God Don't Force eternal life on You by whosoever Will what let him come so you got a choice to make it's your choice God made you a free moral agent you don't have to take God's way if you don't want to you're a free moral agent so you choose not to have eternal life that's your that's your choice and God ain't going to get mad with you for not choosing it you just got you got to go to another place though that's all it is God didn't get mad if you're not choosing eternal life you just got to go to another place amen amen where there is no eternal life hell is not Eternal it's going to stop one day it's going to burn up burn up burn up to exist no more eternal hell is not eternal praise the Lord the Young Rich ruler Mark the 10th chapter so you are free maral agent you can make your own charge nobody Force nothing on you you make your own Char whether you want to sacrifice that thing that you holding on to in order to get eternal life or you don't want to sacrifice it the word sacrifice mean to give up let me read to you some of definition of the word sacrifice y'all bear with me in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord uh the word sacrifice has multiple meanings including giving up something for a greater good or offering something to a dity in this sense we talking about giving up something for a greater good that what God did he sacrificed himself for a greater good that mean to bring eternal life back to his children amen see a great a good sacrificed himself in order to bring eternal life life back to his children so when you're sacrificing something you're looking at doing it for what a greater good amen do you know what a greater good is serving God a greater good in more money a greater good in a bigger house a greater good in a better car a greater good is serving God come on somebody amen that's a great if you sacrificing now a lot of people want sacrifice the time for God they sacrifice the time for God for work because the greater good for to them is getting more money you might get more money but we're going to profit you name see that we got to look at so you you sacrificing for the greater good see you want to benefit offer your sacrifice if you give up something for the Lord don't you know God going to reward you back 10 full 100 full 1,000 full more than you ever gave up you going read that to you can never just give up something for God to God you to give it up well he ain't going to bless you with more amen if you serve him so giving up something for eternal life is a blessing all right giving up something giving up something of value to give him something more desirable giving up something for the sake of something else selling something at a loss amen praise God see you going to lose look like you're losing but you ain't losing you're winning amen look at the Young Rich ruler Mark 10:1 17 see a lot of people say they want eternal life this is how I'm going show you let's see how bad he wanted it same thing to you tonight how bad you want it how bad you want eternal life we going God going to test you like he told tested Abraham God can test you and see just how bad you want eternal life see where you would can you give up something for him in order to get it CU you going to have to make a sacrifice all life revolves around sacrifice they knew that from ancient times that you had to make a sacrifice to a god or something in order to get some favor with God you had to make a sacrifice so all life is about sacrificing you got to make a sacrifice for your children to eat you got to make a sacrifice you can't buy that dress other a nice pair of shoes you want many parents go lacking for their children's sake and children don't even realize how much sacrifice their parents do for them in order for them to have what they got amen lot of children don't even realize it only thing they know they're living good things going good for them but they'll never realize the sacrifice that it take for them to live good amen see parents make sacrifice every day on behalf of their children especially Godly Parents parents they living for the Lord they sacrifice a lot they go lacking a lot because they got the children on their mind amen God did the same thing God had us on his mind Hallelujah he had us on his mind that what he made the sacrifice he wasn't thinking about himself he was thinking about his children that why he made the sacrifice it was for our sake am that he came down amen praise God put on flesh did what he did amen praise the Lord Mark the uh the 10th chapter amen praise the Lord amen man see are you willing to make the sacrifice are you willing to give up that girlfriend that boyfriend that man that woman are you willing to give up anything God tell you to give an all now remember we not we talking about eternal life am a lot of people want it but they're not willing to make the sacrifice are you want to give up your ways praise the Lord and when Jesus was going forth in the mark 10:17 going forth in the way the K one running I like this he came run he's excited lot of people come to church running till they find out what he got to do then they don't run no more they leave because they don't want to do what required they don't want to make the sacrifice see and he came uh running kneel to him and said good Master what shall I do th May inherit eternal life see he that's what he want I want the same thing I'm willing to make the sacrifice amen whatever it takes I willing to do I want eternal life God tried this young man Jesus he's he's going to be tried now and Jesus said to him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth now all that's good you might don't lie you might don't steal you might don't cheat you might do none of these like the rich and ruler but but you still got to make a sacrifice amen something God want you to give up amen now are you willing to give it up that's the question this young man had a good life it seems to be a good life cuz he he did everything that we should not do he didn't go around committing adultery he didn't go around lying he didn't go around stealing and killing and bearing false witness he didn't disobey his parents this young man had a good testimony but he was still lacking something amen he was still lacking J in one scripture the Bible say yet lackest thou one thing he was lacking something see I believe all us lacking something tonight Hallelujah we lack our the sacrifice it take it takes a sacrifice to be a Christian it take a sacrifice to live for God it take a sacrifice to do what's right it take a sacrifice that mean denying yourself what you want to do and let God have his way if they a sacrifice now and lot of young people don't want to make that sacrifice young people now got their own mind they want to do what they want to do go where they want to go do have their own way but now if you want eternal life you want to live for God then you got to make the sacrifice give up your ways for the Lord hallelujah it's a better life amen amen praise the Lord amen he answered him master all theer from my youth up then Jesus Behold Him saying uh loved now he he said Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him and one thing thou lackest go thy way say whatsoever thou had now you want eternal life now what said whatever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that say and went away grieved for he had great possessions he let his money stop him from having eternal life his money got in his way how many yall let money get in your way you rather work than come to church and serve the Lord or you rather be out there doing this or doing that in order to instead in serving the lord money stopped them his wealth stopped them stopped them from eternal life what a sad story he didn't value eternal life he didn't know how precious it was he was in the face of eternal life and didn't even realize where he was at like the uh the the story the unwelcome Christ how uh the the the the foot flunky or whatever he is he went to run to tell Jesus that Simon said he want to invite you to dinner he came right in the face of eternal life instead of him asking Jesus for mercy and to save him he rather tell Simon's message serveth the man and not the God so many people are that way today their servant the man and not the god they rather do what the man say do than do what God say do amen see you're in the face of eternal life don't turn it down God open up the door for you you got the opportunity amen for eternal life this young man let us riches get inside this way the Bible he went away grieved he went away real sadhe hearted because in order to get eternal life he had to give up everything he had how many yall want to give up everything you got God spoke this what God spoke to this young man you might he might asked you to give you asked Abraham to offer up Isaac that were Abraham test go uh to mount Mariah and go there and offer up thy son th only son Isaac whom thou lovest God knew much he loved Isaac so God now is testing him on the love for Isaac or love for God and God tests it all the time who you love the most God said love me with all your heart all your mind all your soul and all your strength that's right so who you love the most see so God testing Abraham on his love who you love the most you love God or you love your children you love God or you love you love your job you love God or you love your preacher you both to love your preach don't love more
