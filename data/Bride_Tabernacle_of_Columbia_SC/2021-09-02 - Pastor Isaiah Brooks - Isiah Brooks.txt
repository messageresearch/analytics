something after that if you ask me to testify you made a bad mistake so let's pray we'll tell you a little bit of stuff father god [Music] you're the most miraculous name that i've ever heard of all the history of mankind jesus said anything that you ask in my name i will do it and tonight as brother siemens was going through all of them names and countries and people and all the things that god's people are going with in this final war on the earth come now jesus every name it was mentioned answer that prayer all we ask god is bring us testimony in jesus christ's name we pray amen now uh i don't like to give report on bad things but the good things is i'm still standing here seven years ago all of you know i had a major stroke i was dead five hours i never spoke a word for 23 days had three trait surgeries never eat a bite of food or drink of water for night for 90 days and i was in a wheelchair for five months and i told the church i rolled up on sunday morning i said next sunday night i'm going to preach and i i come in i had my grandson and my boy to help me up on the platform and i just preached about 10 minutes and you ever feel the holy ghost come in the house i felt a sweeping power of the holy ghost like i never felt before i said boys come and put me on the floor they come up hit me off the platform i started walking backwards and forth and down the highways i said my house for jesus don't you people see what's going on the is walking now [Applause] but so far down here i never got to tell you all what i saw while i was in glory you ever heard of the colored lights and aaron's breastplate in in revelations 4. now i've been in god's blessings and we clap our hands and we scream and run the hallways and things like that i've been there i've been into god's presence under the anointing of the holy ghost preaching i've been there but i never felt or seen anything like this to enter into god's glory and i saw all these lights flashing all these colored lights as i was being lifted up and i tell everybody in this tent i don't care what you have to give up who you have to bypass what you ever have to do don't you miss that place called glory and so there was two questions had been on my mind for 20 years and i by god i said lord where is he at where can i find it at he said go to revelations 4 for part 1 and i used this in a church of god a prophecy funeral the other night and the pastor asked me to preach his daddy's funeral i didn't know the general overseer or the state of tennessee was sitting there but i said first thing god said he said now look closely there's one that sits on the throne and the only thing in the bible that men the devil agrees on is this only one god and so i got a chance to tell them i said there's only one that sits on the throne i said now god said that second part you want to see look over revelations five and five i looked over and that one that said on the throne the first time in all the history of mankind that lamb stood up and i see that lamb open that book of redemption and guess what i saw a name on the lounge book of life named bill yachts i said take me on back you don't have to tell me anything else that's all i want but i i don't think i'd ever mentioned that here before but that started miraculous things happen in my life and since that time i had another mini stroke two months ago i stand in the pulpit my hand started being numb and my face was numb the nurse said and the church chair said you better get to the emergency room quickly you're having a mini stroke so that's what i had mini stroke so that's two strokes i had three heart attacks i had three times in the hospital with pneumonia i had double hernia surgery and even before i went into the surgery uh they put that cap on me you know like when they take you in the surgery room and my doctor said he was in there and all the doctors and nurses was in the surgery room he said hey everybody come over here and so all the doctors and nurses here they come over to my bed he said i want to introduce you all to a real international missionary and he gave me his own personal testimony telephone number he said now anytime you need me you call me on this number make friends but that ain't all god this just keeps raising me up i was in the pulpit preaching like sunday morning i was telling some of them before service i looked back and i said hey devil let me tell you something when i get done with you you'll rust that you'd have never heard my name in the earth is everybody in your love the devil i thought i'd get a lot of amens on that you don't feel like that too but i'm slower and i'm older than i've ever been but i'm still going does anybody believe in prophecy there was a man stood in a chair right behind my pulpit after he preached he stood up and prophesied he said god is going to restore this pastor 100 percent last sunday morning i got up and i cough all the time i have been for 15 years so i got up and and i vomit something black and fell in the commode i heard the voice say you are healed and brother larry the devil has fought me all week long trying to stop me but i keep telling everybody i'm healed [Music] you just watch and see and if god has to wait till i get a brand new 18 year old body at 77 years old i'll take it would you like to hear 1500 more testimonies well i better tell you where i've been for the last year i have not been outside of my church door god spoke to me seven years ago and he said go home and stay with your church i kept seeing all these miraculous things taking place i said surely god you're with me if all this is happening he gave me a stroke you know what as quick as i got feeling better i took off again i was down in smithfield tennessee and i had a major heart attack i drove four and a half hours home but from smithfield to knoxville tennessee was the longest trip i ever made in my life god just kept telling me brother simmons did not i tell you to go home and stay at your church here i was gone again and just uh different places people call me and i'd go and i'd say god do all the miraculous thing so brother david farmer called me up in virginia and said brother bill come i said brother farmer this will be the last meeting i ever preached on the road i'm going home and i'm going to stay with my church like god is trying to kill me to get me to do and so i cried i come down the interstate crying and the altars were filled and god's power was moving it's it's just i'm not bragging but it's just when he sadly this happens and i was crying i said now god you've told me to go back to my church now for me to stay there and be encouraged these things that have been happening has to happen in my church too so you know what i've got testimony after testimony after testimony of god doing things for people in my church and we're those good there ain't many people left but you know what i got to looking at some words of jesus they uh there was a man one time in the bible that while hurried and get down here there was a man in the bible that had a son that had epileptic seizures and this boy was driving his daddy out of his mind and he said one minute he's in the fire next minute he's in the water and i can just imagine what this voice looked like but it got so desperate that daddy screamed jesus have mercy on me he said i brought my son unto the ministers of the hour which were the apostles of that time and oh you ministered around here to listen what i'm saying he said i brought him to the ministers of the iron they couldn't help him he said now brothers come aside i want to talk to you all a little bit now these things come he said by fasting in prayer but first of all this man told jesus he said i'm not worthy that you can even come by my house he said just speak the word and he talked to jesus a few things but i tell this and do this and this and he said you know what i have not found so great of faith no not in all israel now you might fuss at me but when i pray for the sick i i don't even take a bottle of water no more that's in the bible but my prophet said it was a jewish tradition and that's what we're all getting for come to where the great faith is at in the power of the holy ghost of god speak what you ask for and don't be afraid that watch it happen if you don't think it's going to happen there ain't no use for you to speak it and then another place jesus looked turned around looked at him he said now what's harder now you all have grandchildren and children like i do and seem like it you could bag and plead and try to get them into the house of god but jesus said what's harder than to say take up thy bed and walk or say thy seems to be forgiven thee and if we we are supposed to possess a power that comes from our lips that actually limbs will be restored on people's body now if we can do that what's better what about the rest of it i'm sorry brother simmons i'm going to quit without about 1200 more testimonials keeps coming i get excited but i want you to know my fight is not over yet my fight against the enemy's not yet he thinks he's going to whoop us i'm sorry he's got the wrong chicken because i'm going to fight him because he ain't nothing but a stupid lyra why don't you call him what he is and when you read isaiah 14 and 12 is this the man that calls nation to him is that really him he ain't he's a nothing he's a nobody hey brother isaiah i'm getting out of here cause i feel like preaching [Applause] my milk [Music] we give out to our lord and savior jesus christ thank god for his grace and his mercy amen true lord god has been good to us and i don't know about you but i know this is a time where everybody seemed to be on pins and needles and but uh i could truly say that the lord has made me free we give honor to our brother simmons for having us here tonight and it's always good to be under the tent [Music] well we're going to sing just one song and then we'll get right into the word if if the lord allow us to sing something else afterwards we will do so i love you lord for your mercy never fails me all of my days i've been held in your hands from the moment that i wake up until i lay my head oh i will sing are the goodness of god and all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good in every breath that i am able oh i will sing are the goodness of god i love your voice [Music] you have led me through the fire in the darkest night you are closer like no other i've known you as a father i've known you as a friend and i have lived in the goodness of god yay [Music] [Applause] [Music] you have been so so good [Music] with every breath that i am able

goodness of god oh yes i will i will sing of the goodness of god [Music] hallelujah [Music] i'm gonna need some water i left mine in the car in the door god is so good to us i'm excited i believe everything that our brother has said tonight everything concerning god i believe we are living in a time where fear is supposed to vanish that's what the bible says that perfect love cast out fear i don't believe anything happens by chance everything has been ordained by god i remember the time when we used to sing everything is moving by the power of god that's saying that let's sing that this is attempt meeting let's sing that everything's moving by the power of god everything's moving by the way everything's moving everything's moving oh everything is moving ah everything's moving oh everything's moving oh everything's moving you see i roast this morning yes i roast this morning [Music] moving [Music] moving oh everything's moving [Music] everything's moving all the sun and the moon the moon and the stars [Music] i said everything's moving [Music] i got that holy ghost yes i got that holy ghost and i got the holy ghost [Music] this morning [Music] everything's moving moving [Music] everything's moving everything's moving [Music] oh the preacher and the deacon i said the preacher and the deacon i said the preacher and the vegan yes i ever did moving i said the preacher and the pope [Music] i said the preacher and the pope i said the preacher and the pope oh everything's moving i say everything's moving i said everything's moving moving [Music] everything's moving [Music] [Music] nobody do me like the lord can't nobody do that jesus he [Music] [Applause] [Music] nobody [Music] oh he healed my body he [Music] oh yes he saved my soul and he he tamed my soul and he [Applause] that's how he saved my soul oh here hallelujah can't nobody [Music] can nobody do me like jesus can't nobody do me like jesus can't nobody do me like jesus [Music] can't nobody do me like sheila not my mother not my father [Music] not my sister not my brother nobody nobody [Music] nobody [Music] yes he is he my friend [Music] he's my friend hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] i know it's hot and but i don't mind getting sweaty for the lord [Music] as we stand we're just going to go right into the word of god you see my brother jasper [Music] my keeping power [Music] keeps me just thinking about brother youngsen his testimony gets sweeter every time he's a living witness of what god can do [Music] if we would just turn to philippians the second chapter i try my best not to be long and every time i say that so i trust that god would give us grace tonight i know this is a thursday night some of us have to go to work in the morning so it's okay if somebody pull my coat tail if i get too long which i trust i won't i believe this message that the lord has given me tonight really doesn't take long shouldn't take long but it depends upon your attitude toward the word i really believe that all things are possible to them that believe talking about miracles i'm the greatest miracle i have ever seen [Music] because when god changed me he changed me philippians 2 4 we've come a long ways people and i'm excited because i see the finishing line [Music] this is not a time to fight each other you won't make it that way because this age is calling for perfect love when satan can get us to fight to backbite or to criticize first of all you're fallen when you do that you defeat it when you do that because all of us have saved we're saved by the grace of god the same blood that saves a rich man is the same blood that saves a poor man the blood that saves a well man is the same blood that heals and save a crippled man one blood and by the grace of god i trust that we have the love of god in our hearts to understand the hour that we're living in philippians 2 4. let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything you have done thus far i know this is the beginning of the services and but lord you have no respect to person we didn't come to do a hollywood thing we've only come to hear from you give us the grace to move complete hallelujah out of your way to our hearts and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated every time i think about what god has done which are wretch like me when i see how in these last days that he's actually calling for a people that he himself has created when we look at philippians we think that paul is you know that's the way it was with me i thought it was something you know your mind is just something you know just a piece of part of you but i find out that the mind is actually your character because the bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and just to think that god has given us an opportunity to allow his mind to be in us it does something for me because i realize amen that you cannot have the mind of god in you along with your own mind there's something that i feel that in this message or in this way of living we have missed there's nothing wrong with the shouting in the dancing there's nothing wrong with healings and deliverances but i want you to understand it's not everything because the very thing that god came to do for us in this generation is to restore his life the very thing that adam lost was the very mind of god he lost his character and listen people i believe in shouting i believe in dancing i believe in running around the altar whatever y'all know that to be true you see me do it but i've come to find out that the greatest thing a man or woman could have would be the life of god hallelujah we know by god's grace when you and i get can get into the channel of christ do you know what that means even jesus himself said that i can do nothing except the father show me hallelujah it's more than a feeling somebody help me here it's more than a feeling somebody it's more than your church that you associate with god don't care about your system of worship god wants somebody who's free the bible said where where he who the son is set free is free indeed i feel that so many people have literally married a system instead of jesus christ somebody help me here we learn how to shout we learn how to dance and some of us even learn how to speak in tongues but that's not it that may be a part of it but that's not all of it and i don't know about you tonight i don't want a part of god i don't want a peace of god i want all of him hallelujah god is real hallelujah you and i must understand by god's grace we are unworthy creatures mortal men that god has invited to become immortal hallelujah come on somebody it doesn't matter i know some of y'all have those masks on but i can still hear you when we look at it and we see by god's grace that in this hour we're no longer called church we're called bride hallelujah now you must understand because we said well brother brooks what are you saying i'm saying in 1963 god changed and he moved in a way that so many people missed it but those who ordained to be the bride of jesus christ they caught it what was he doing calling us avalia deceil hallelujah into an eternal place hallelujah and there is only one internal place and that's christ himself hallelujah but you don't get there by being a church member hallelujah we fail to see and you know i'm telling you the truth there have been many people who when they got the holy ghost they thought that was it hallelujah but that's just the beginning of it hallelujah you've got to grow you've got to mature you've got to allow the characteristics of christ to be formed in you hallelujah ask peter about it peter said add to your faith virtue virtual knowledge it goes all the way up into the full statue of christ hallelujah do you think god is going to take you higher when he's already said power without character is satanic hallelujah so it doesn't make any difference you can you can raise the dead hallelujah pray that the eyes of the blind is open but all those things are to no avail until christ be formed in you y'all hear what i'm saying see because when you really got to genuine there's no turning back hallelujah when you really got the genuine there's no thirsting for the world when you really got the genuine wine you'll leave mother father sister brother whoever you lose leave everybody to follow jesus [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god when you realize jesus even said to the overcomer i would grant you to sit with me in my throne even as i have sat in my father's throne maybe we just don't understand what that means but that's more than i would say authority hallelujah you see my brother brooks is it is the word open there was a time when the word was closed even in daniel's time is that right the book was sealed but in our day this bible is open it has become an open book why god has broken the seal hallelujah y'all understand what that means that means the whole book [Music] has been given to you hallelujah the bible is right jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't get me wrong i love the word hallelujah you say what do you mean i love the word worry about who's preaching if you think i'm preaching you missing the boat already but let me say it like this amen this book has always been the message hello somebody you can't separate god neither can you divide him up hallelujah is that right he said i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end and if you read this book and can't see christ read it again hallelujah glory to god what we fail to see is what we call the message was just a restoration of that which was is that right he's a which was which is and which now god don't change hallelujah glory to god he said well go ahead on brother books i will so we understand by god's grace that often times can i say this without anybody getting mad when those seals were opened god if i could say it like this changed his throne room hallelujah see a lot of us think the throne room is in heaven but when god listen is that the truth even paul said behold i saw the lord descending in a cloud is that right so you understand amen what god ascending in the cloud i'm sorry ascending in the cloud but what john says i saw a mighty angel descending so the same one that ascended in paul's day is the same one john saw descending and he's here tonight hallelujah you say oh praise god we thought the holy ghost was just a shout out we thought the holy ghost was just a dance hallelujah praise god we spoke in tongues like like like pouring peas on a cow hide hallelujah and we found ourselves powerless and the reason being because you failed to move on somebody taught you because they taught me that this was the ultimate until this message came justification makes room for sanctification sanctification makes room for the holy ghost and holy ghost make rooms for what the person himself hallelujah i did not know that i was to have the whole person hallelujah the whole character come on somebody the whole character christ in you the hope of glory the bible says know ye not that you are the temple of the holy ghost hallelujah it is you who god has made the throne room hallelujah you say they ain't the bible yes it is the bible say don't even think he's up there on some long journey he says he's 90 even in your mouth hallelujah and for those of us who think you can be spewing out of god's mouth it's impossible you never was in his mouth that was the layout to see you you say prove it can we go to esther just for a moment i'm gonna leave my notes right over there because he said i've engraved you in the palms of my hands that's not his mouth hallelujah god can't get rid of you no more than adam could get rid of eve somebody help me here because remember this thing with me and you just didn't happen come on somebody i wasn't saved amen in 1974 i was saved before the foundation of the world hallelujah let me tell you something god don't take chances i want to say to those who are not saved yet or you may not understand what i'm trying to say but i'm telling you there's a greater god there's more of him hallelujah there's more of him and when you are in a system systems always make you miss god amen hallelujah oh yes there's a lot of people that's in a message system hallelujah y'all better hear what i'm saying it didn't stop at the pentecost it moved right on up here that's why people are not happy anymore that's why they don't have the joy they used to have that's why they don't pray and fast hallelujah because they have allowed themselves to be married to a system hallelujah but he whom the son is set free he's free indeed that means i can love those who don't love me hallelujah that means i can fellowship with those who don't agree with me hallelujah let me say it like this we were there just not long ago at a church whose doctrine is totally different from mine pretty much but you know what we concentrated on getting the people to the holy ghost hallelujah you see because if we can get them to the holy ghost the holy ghost will correct all era hallelujah is that right the bible says that the holy ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth but the truth of the matter is people don't want to work with people no more huh oh we want the baptist doctrine you receive it when you believe it that is not the truth paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believe hallelujah y'all hear me the holy ghost is not a thing the holy ghost is a person it is the person of jesus christ hallelujah and it's not enough to say i got it and your tree is showing something different because the bible says you'll know the tree by the fruit it pay hallelujah oh glory to god you love the lord i'm just going to let god have his way tonight hallelujah because we must understand we must have the mind of christ hallelujah jesus christ himself now let me tell you something until you die in rot hallelujah you say lord more of you and less of me none of me i don't want none of me until you get to that place you have not made 100. 99 and i have won't do this is what i feel that people have allowed satan to do just like he did israel hallelujah they got it at ease and they rose up to play and this is not a time to play this time is a serious time y'all hear what i'm saying we're right at the end of this thing when your body and my body if you're made right will bring a translation hallelujah we'll step from this dimension into the other one he's old brother brooks you see what people don't understand is that when things are quiet when things are silent that's when things go on hallelujah have you ever had babysitted or kept any children and all of a sudden they got quiet you say you better go in there and check it y'all hear what i'm saying silence and quiet doesn't mean it ain't nothing going on most of the time that's when the things are happening oh help me jesus i said all of that to say when those seals were broken and there was a half hour of silence everybody's still trying to see what that means what it meant and even though the man of god couldn't see it at that appointed time it doesn't mean he didn't see it later don't you know nothing could be added nor taken away so everything that was brought had to be found in the book has to be found in the book you say let me give you an example when it came to ruth what did ruth do in the time of silence winners were quiet she found the feet of boaz hallelujah oh help me somebody he woke up and something happened she disturbed his silence she destroyed the silence and when he woke up he saw her he didn't rebuke her but he gave her praise hallelujah and guess what she said cover me cover me somebody help me see in the silence there's a portion of the bride her portion is to find out where boaz is lying hallelujah oh come on somebody you say well brother books i don't know about that well let's take esther you know i love esther but at a time of troubles i'm trying to bring it so everybody can get something in a time of troubles esther was already queen just like you are hallelujah but all of a sudden troubles came troubles trouble's coming hallelujah y'all think this is trouble this is no trouble trouble is coming but the king there was a law there was a law you can't disturb the king he's silent he's silent you can't disturb him for 30 days you can't disturb him but trouble trouble king hallelujah hallelujah and mordecai tola this old haman this old devil he's out to kill you wait a minute let me tell y'all something church people the devil is out to kill you you can lay still you can lay quiet but this is a time of urgency y'all hear what i'm saying this is a time of desperation you know i know what i'm talking about because you want to run you really want to run from god but run for god but you're having a nightmare because something has got you moving slow you know the devil is behind you what i'm going to do he's going to catch me in a little bit let me tell you the solution on the name of jesus hallelujah that's how you come out of that nightmare by calling on the name of jesus somebody help me here time of troubles haman hate the jews he hates everything about you hallelujah but guess what god has hidden you nobody don't even know y'all exist hallelujah don't even know you queen [Laughter] hallelujah what did god give you a no-name church not a popular church some church nobody don't know the name of hallelujah but they failed to see god gave you a new name hallelujah god gave you the name of bride how am i going to cut i'm in this place can't disturb the king of silence but like i said when the times of silence is when god is doing something mordecai says esther you've been ordained for this moment i love it brother i ain't scared either no no how can i be when god is on the inside hallelujah oh may i live for him because i'm truly not afraid to die oh she said if i perish let me perish [Music] i'm going to see the king so i don't know about everybody else brother i don't know about everybody else but this man i got to see him i got to see him i said hallelujah no matter what the cost no matter what it takes no matter how much i must suffer hallelujah i have a date i have an appointment and he's made it this is the part i like she enters the throne room now understand when it comes to business you don't interrupt the king but she understood her position and most of all she knew how much he loved her see that's the thing we don't realize how much he loves you hallelujah but think about this for a moment the king of glory god himself wrapped himself up into a flesh became the son of god went to calvary for you y'all understand me they spat in his face they whipped him like they say all night long he blessed and died for you they pierced him they crowned him with thorns hallelujah y'all better help me because you realize those thorns represented you but he wore them for you so this old cockapoo could be saved hallelujah we didn't know it we came here as a cockapoo but on the inside was a wheat germ help me somebody he bled he died for you you've got to come to know how much he loves you hallelujah is that right he said listen if you believe in me he said you'll never die y'all believe that if you truly believe in me you'll never die i believe that i believe that she knew how much he loved her but when she walked up she caught his eyes can i say it like this she was looking in the face of god hello you say it wasn't no but in type he was you understand me he was king he understood in those days kings were but nevertheless she caught his eye that's what you got to do you got to catch his eyes have you ever caught his eyes hallelujah you know what i'm saying you know when you're in love how you catch each other's eyes and all of a sudden you're frozen for a moment let me move on by the grace of god but the truth of the matter is nobody can explain that moment to you in silence you communicated a love that was so spiritual that only you and your partner knew and felt what it was oh god help me jesus so what happens she re he reached when when she reached him he handed out the scepter do you all know what that means it was just a shadow and a type when jesus the lamb of god took the book and he reached out to john and said take the book oh see you're missing it what was it it was a shadowing type of what god was doing what was he doing you say that's not scripture yes it is because the king himself after giving esther the chapter he said i give you half of the kingdom and when you become joiners with christ hallelujah you become join us with christ when you you understand me that was the king's authority but in heaven the word is the king's authority oh come on somebody when god give the man of god the sword hallelujah it was his authority you got to recognize that we're not called to be just little christians barely making it oh lord restore my joy you're still living in that time where god has to restore your joy you should have never gave it up the devil didn't take it you gave it up take back what the devil stole he ain't stole nothing you gave it to him is that the bible the bible said no evil shall come not your dwelling place hallelujah and where do you dwell right here god doesn't build a firewall about me how can the devil come through somebody help me here you hear what i'm saying then afterwards this is what i love hallelujah must not need them afterwards what happens the king says what is it that you want esther esther i want to re esther says king i want a revival come on somebody [Applause] i want a revival yes you know it's true now i love to eat and when you got a banquet going on you don't ever hear nobody say oh this just don't taste good and no sir you have to pray that you're not a glutton right you enjoying it everybody's laughing guilty is everywhere hallelujah and get to the place people start shouting across the room taste this piece of cake you hear what i'm saying it's the truth i've heard them i've seen them even in the baptist church you know they could cook folks come on y'all know it's true special macaroni and cheese and then it says you you go to your best friend have you tasted that i'm gonna tell you something see that when i win that gold bowl that's it right y'all know what i'm saying see what i'm saying is when you're in the banquet of god with the king you can't help but to share it you say that can't be true let me tell you something she even said bring the devil bring the devil i want to show him how much i love him i want him to see how much my king loves me y'all better hear me you don't have to worry about nothing you don't have to fret it's going to get worse but as it gets worse god is going to get better hallelujah this is all for you the move is on for the bride not who moves on the bride the move is on for the bride all of the politics all of the unions of the church everything they're doing is trying to get you in your place hallelujah haman was on the move but he was on the move for esther esther didn't even know what all she had hallelujah until she was put under pressure hallelujah but god is looking for character see esther didn't get there because of just her beauty she got into that place because of her character y'all hear what i'm saying and she wasn't ashamed of the king's garment y'all hear me she wasn't ashamed holly yes sir she didn't care how long the dress was she didn't care if it wasn't a tight and squeezy hallelujah she just wanted to please the god she wanted to please her her husband hallelujah guess what and she added nothing whatever the garment was she didn't add to it hallelujah come on somebody you say oh attitude yes people say oh i got the holy ghost and i got oil coming out of my hand where is that in the word somebody help me here see those kind of things add to it and when you get to a place where you got to make people live right you adding to it that's the truth you can't make nobody be a sheep if it's a goat it's a goat it's gonna always be a goat unless you can change the nature and let's that nature change hallelujah you love the lord hallelujah let me move on by god's grace matthew 6 i'm not going to be too much longer how many of y'all believe the word i believe that god has done a great thing in our day and i'm gonna tell you something people of god don't you let nobody system cause you to miss the quickening of the changing of the body now i'm gonna tell you like this you can be in the message almost all your life but without character you're not going anywhere well i tell you what my daddy had a temper y'all hear what i'm saying well your daddy needed to get rid of it ain't no temple's gonna be in heaven y'all better hear me everything this world has produced must be done away with problem is many of us have not been born again of the holy ghost and fire is that right in the future home the holy ghost and fire burns all the demons off of the earth and that's the kind of holy ghost we must have it must burn all of the demons away hallelujah i can't do it no you can't but he can hallelujah you say brother brooks turn with me to matthew 6 please hallelujah i don't know how long i've been but i'm trying to get us to somewhere god is good to us people hallelujah i want to be good to him he's always been good to me chasing me to give me his goodness y'all hear me at times i slow down he coming said okay you got to keep going hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying times when i would thought think to myself lord am i crazy i the only one seeing what i see i've seen healings i've seen miracles i've seen all kinds of things i've seen god create now you might say well yes i have you weren't there but let me say it like this however it got there it got there hallelujah and let me say it like this i've watched the scripture and i have seen how israel saw all kinds of signs and miracles and wonders not talking down what my brother said but i'm just agreeing with him you got to come up higher hallelujah our brother didn't witness those things on earth god took him up somewhere you've got to come up higher to see what i'm talking about hallelujah you understand me so you say well brother brooks what are you saying i'm trying to tell us we've stayed around this this is time for revival now if you're going to have a revival this is it you may not get another time and what is revival getting all the trash out of your life hallelujah getting it all out of me and as long as you're washing that box you ain't gonna have you're gonna have trash in your life oh you got quiet huh well i can have one you can you got the liberty to have more than one one in every room hallelujah and i'll tell anybody you know it ain't the box

what i'm talking about hallelujah i've been there i've done that i've overcome y'all understand me hallelujah what are you saying i'm bound for the christ i'm bound for a heavenly kingdom and the kingdom has come it is now oh god i don't i don't know who i'm talking to but let me you know my heart goes out because i think about all the beautiful songs we've sang and you know all of the years we spent jumping and shouting and we're leading off the best part ain't nothing like the character of christ living in you when somebody rail you you don't reel back when somebody talk about you you don't talk about them you can love those who don't love you hallelujah y'all understand ain't nothing like that kind of a peace hallelujah but it's not me paul said it's christ that lives in me this is the kind of christian we want not some denominational brand christian we're talking about a christ word christian a seed christian a christian that loved god and love them with their whole heart whole mind and whole soul i hope this message has been a blessing all i know is that is later than we think remember when jesus at the wedding the canaan wedding he told to go fill six pots with water they went and they filled the six pots with water and he turned the water into wine you see but god wasn't complete he was the seventh you see out of me floors rivers of living waters hallelujah when he talked with the woman at the well hallelujah he said go get your husband she says i don't have one he didn't say you're a liar he said you're right it's the truth you have one now and the one that you have is not your own hallelujah but i come [Laughter] i come come to be your seventh and we know that the sabbath means completion i come to take your weary away i come to take your heart them away i come to take your nightmares away i come to take your unrestfulness away i am the prince of peace hallelujah and guess what she did she ran to the city and said come see a man hallelujah let me tell you brothers and sisters if god is in you you are the temple of god hallelujah that means this thing has turned hey it's not just a prophet it's the bride y'all hear what i'm saying we can all talk about what he did but let's talk about what the pride is doing right now hallelujah she is the word of god for this hour hey if you're gonna see jesus you see him in his bride did you understand me and therefore you must become the open book ah you are the bible hallelujah let me let me close with this scripture hallelujah this is the this is the first night and i hope i've set a little foundation by god's grace for the next preacher hallelujah matthew 6. you love the lord you know a lot of times people don't understand that but i'll say it like this everybody is going through something your trials are not mine and my trials are not yours but everything everybody is bearing some kind of a cross hallelujah but let me tell you something jesus bore the cross along the bible says hallelujah but every victory jesus won you won because he was there he said oh god i can't take it no more just remember the crown of thorns migraine the crown of thorns he suffered that for you that means you can be free from migraines hallelujah piercing in the side oh i got pains i got aches he died for that hallelujah i got back pain he died for that hallelujah oh my hands got arthritis he died for that you can be free from every ailment of the body he conquered it death hell in the grave for you you don't have to be handicapped god is a healer he's still a deliverer he's still here

is your body god is inside your body talk to your body bring it under subjection to the word of god oh jesus matthew six we're gonna begin reading that the tenth verse won't be long i'm almost done this this scripture is is what i live with every day i think of this scripture basically in some way or another starting at the 10th verse thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth didn't say on earth on earth right now is chaotic huh everywhere you go when this whole uh a covet thing started god said read genesis 6. and i read genesis 6. you know the lord told me it was going to be more than one wave of this thing oh he did but let me tell you like this he said i'll hide you on the shout of my wings hallelujah you believe in the cleft of the rock you go place yourself there hallelujah so let me say it like this let me move on by god's grace as the days go on there's going to be what they say all kinds of shortages food shortages everything kind of shortages and and i think to myself what you going to do i know that in the days of elijah now if you can't believe this you can't believe nothing but the bible says that the lord said elijah with a raven hallelujah somebody help me here you say well what about what about that's the old testament let me bring it to the new testament then there is a two fish and five loaves of bread somebody help me here and jesus was on the scene come on somebody you say oh he's not here but he is here he's in you he's in me he's here oh come on folks don't let this badger skin make you miss the holies of holies is that right see the devil tells you you ain't no good you're a loser uh yeah this is badger skin one of the most meanest animals there is this old badger is not afraid of bears nor anything else lions you name it right you know your heart is when people say oh man it was terrible today that fellow badgered me all day that's not a compliment god didn't make the holies of holies the veil out of lamb skin not even out of goat skin he made it out of your skin the badger is that the truth make a mistake and she wants your skin or your your body badger you see you shouldn't have done that the devil uses it you've been a fool man see you shouldn't have done that right he keeps badgering you but you need to tell them yes but this old badger has been condemned but on the inside of this badger skin it's the holies of holies it's a holy and living god here's the scripture thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in me in you as it is in heaven they don't sing the blues in heaven why me lord what have i ever done to deserve this hallelujah hey no blues [Music] oh they're singing joyful songs they're singing holy songs they're singing songs of life hallelujah let me tell you like this people of god they don't even need a beat hallelujah and those who love the world you don't need one it's all right to heaven but you don't need it absolutely i am the beat i like that i am the beat hallelujah you understand me you and i must understand what god is doing with us words cannot express i didn't go into some things because i see the audience but by the grace of god i hope i got over something i want us to see something here i was telling uh brother i think brother sims we were talking today and i want to say this to everybody how many of y'all believe y'all are the seed of god amen don't you know nothing can alter that everything god has made can never be really destroyed ah it doesn't matter we know we eat those things that look like apples we eat those things that look like grapes we call them grapes we call them apples but there is an original one and in the new jerusalem the original will be there you understand what i'm saying you see an apple has always been an apple it cannot transform itself into a pair unless it's manipulated somebody help me here and all i'm trying to tell you is that you don't let nobody manipulate you to being something else other than the word of god hallelujah the days of miracles have passed are you serious that cannot be because i'm the greatest miracle hallelujah you say god don't heal no more that cannot be because god healed me they say god don't deliver no more that cannot be because god delivered me somebody help me here if god has done something for you you need to give god the praise we are the witnesses we are the witnesses to the word of god let the world do what they want to do but we are the witnesses that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Music] hallelujah i'm closing i could preach all night i left all my notes thank god but i'm gonna tell you something it's later than you think i don't know if we have visitors here but i hope i didn't run you away if you and i trust that something was said that strikes you see let me tell you something because i came up my mother raised me as a baptist from the baptist i went from the baptist to the methodist from the methodist to the catholic now that's bad isn't it i was going backwards for sure from the catholic to the apostolics and when i got there whoo my god i remember when the holy ghost got a hold on me don't tell me it wasn't it was the holy ghost when the holy ghost got a hold on me oh oh my god i think i was walking that much that far off the ground hallelujah but the system got a hold of me because they told me if i hadn't spoken tongues i didn't have it i said what you mean to tell me i can feel this good you don't mean to tell me my life has changed like this and i don't have it yet no you ain't got it i had it but the system got to me somebody help me i'm not saying you don't speak in tongues because i did and it brought some more joy y'all better hear me but that was just the beginning that was just the beginning higher heights deeper depths is that right the scripture tells us amen how wide it is how deep it is and so he said it's a it surpasses our knowledge so how we gonna get it how we gonna get it it must come by revelation upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell should not prevail against it is there anyone who want to go farther with the lord say brother brooks i haven't been doing just right i believe the message i really believe what you're saying but i haven't been living the standard it ain't my standard it's the word standard and one thing i know about this like i was telling him when the book was open john said i looked i looked to see a lion but when i turned i saw a lamb now watch this because a wedding ceremony was getting ready to take place it wasn't a lion it was a lamb that was getting married and lambs only mate with lambs they don't mate with lions they don't mate with goats somebody help me so i'm gonna tell you the key what i'm trying to tell you when it changed from no four living creatures into the lamb god was saying the only way you will make it you must become a lamb hello somebody the nature of the lamb must be there it ain't your religion it's your nature change somebody help me you understand me the prophet god said jesus christ defeated the devil at calvary with sweetness and meekness go look it go find it sweetness and meekness you understand me there's got to be a nature change let's stand by the grace of god didn't mean to go so long but i want to say this by the grace of god i just let him use me i just let him talk speak my notes perhaps would have directed me in a different way but i feel like it's it's a need because what good is all of this all of this all of this i love you lord i love you lord everybody say they love him lord i love you lord but it's more than words hallelujah in order to love the lord the way you should love him there's got to be a nature change his nature must come into you and that nature is the holy ghost and like i was saying earlier before the enemy took that thought from me people don't want to pray with folks no more but i went up there in michigan it was a brother and i knew that they'd differ but you know what when we had the altar call the power of god came in that place the love of god hallelujah swept through that place from day one to the end of it hallelujah and i'm telling you they acted the way the old folks used to add hallelujah they were getting so filled with god they were hitting the floor and everything nobody said oh that's a demon no no no no no the love of god was in that place people were changed even my grandbaby 15 years old went up and god touched her y'all better hear me he's still the same [Music] a birth is a birth a birth is a mess hallelujah oh i believe the message that ain't good enough have you received the holy ghost since you believed oh you can't just be a cr dried-eyed confession something's got to happen i can't tell you how to act but one thing for sure when they're going to know it [Music] is there anybody anybody god is good without him without god i would be nothing without god i shall [Music] with our god my whole life would be worthless [Music] like a ship [Music] without god would be nothing without god [Music] i surely withheld [Music] with our god my life will be drifted drifting like a ship without [Music] you say brother brooks i'm married to a system the joy of the lord is gone isn't it funny we'll use that script to restore my joy and i wonder how on earth that left how do you joy your salvation i've had troubles i had trials but the joy of my salvation has never left me and it never will but anyway i don't want to take too much more time we're gonna ask our brother simmers
