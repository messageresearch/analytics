[48:54] The Book of Romans 1 and 16.
[48:58] and Mark 8
[49:01] 34.
[49:02] Romans
[49:05] 1 and 16.
[49:08] for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[49:11] Christ
[49:12] for it is the power of God and to
[49:14] Salvation to everyone that believeth
[49:18] to the Jews first
[49:20] and also to the Greek
[49:23] Romans I mean Mark 8
[49:26] 34
[49:28] Mark 8 and 34.
[49:31] says
[49:35] and when he had called the people unto
[49:38] him with his disciples also
[49:42] said unto them
[49:44] whosoever will come after me let him
[49:46] deny himself
[49:48] take up his cross and follow me
[49:51] for whosoever will save
[49:54] his life shall lose it
[49:57] but whosoever shall lose his life for my
[50:02] sake and for the gospel the same shall
[50:05] save it
[50:07] for what shall a man profit if he should
[50:11] gain the whole world and lose his own
[50:14] soul
[50:16] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[50:19] his soul
[50:20] and whosoever therefore shall be ashamed
[50:23] of me and my words in this adulterate
[50:29] doctris and sinful generation of him
[50:34] also shall the son of man be ashamed
[50:38] when he come in his glory of his father
[50:42] with his Holy Angels may God bless you
[50:46] read his words you may be seated
[50:49] we want to talk about being ashamed of
[50:52] him
[50:54] you know I was just spraying it
[50:57] as I was praying it just comes so in my
[51:01] spirit that
[51:03] reason why people live the way they live
[51:05] in them why they responding is because
[51:08] of the shame that they have of being a
[51:12] Christian
[51:13] the reason why people fear to be
[51:16] Christians and they are embarrassed
[51:19] to be called a Christian and but there
[51:22] are many that take on the name of
[51:24] Christian but impersonating Christianity
[51:27] they're not really Christian
[51:29] but they'll I want to speak to those
[51:32] that are
[51:33] embarrassed a shame to be identified to
[51:36] be called Christians
[51:38] not those that say they're Christians
[51:40] and in person in Christianity we have
[51:43] those what we call hypocrites
[51:46] that will amen impersonate Christianity
[51:50] that would want to be in the Forefront
[51:52] and want to be called by his name but
[51:54] they don't want to live the Bible says
[51:57] let everyone the name that name of
[51:59] Christ let him depart from indicative
[52:02] amen there's some that want to live the
[52:05] way they live but as he said in the the
[52:08] seven women would take hold of one man
[52:10] and said let us eat our own bread but
[52:12] let us be called by your name
[52:15] in other words we want to do our own
[52:17] thing but we want to be called by your
[52:19] name
[52:20] and so there are people want to be named
[52:23] called by the name of Jesus and they
[52:26] want to be Christians but they want to
[52:28] eat their own bread
[52:30] their own Doctrine their own teaching
[52:32] their own way ideologies what they think
[52:35] about Christianity what they think about
[52:37] Jesus how they want to serve them they
[52:40] want to do their own thing
[52:41] but I'm not ashamed Paul says of the
[52:44] Gospel
[52:45] it's something about the Gospel of Jesus
[52:47] Christ is that I'm not ashamed of the
[52:49] Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the
[52:53] power of God to Salvation to everyone to
[52:56] believe
[52:57] praise God the reason why amen people
[52:59] are shame because they don't believe but
[53:02] he says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of
[53:04] Jesus Christ because it is the power of
[53:07] God
[53:08] unto salvation day everyone that bleeds
[53:12] people got a problem with believing
[53:14] and because they have a problem in
[53:17] believing amen then they'll shame
[53:20] some folks believe that like the devil
[53:23] does the devil bleed but he trembles
[53:25] amen praise God he can't live this word
[53:28] he don't want to live it he wants to
[53:30] amen imitating and personate in persons
[53:35] y'all got it
[53:38] but he don't want to live it isn't that
[53:41] right
[53:42] y'all understand what I'm saying
[53:44] amen so folks uh uh that those are one
[53:48] that looked timid
[53:49] because uh uh the reason why people are
[53:53] a little timid and a lot because they're
[53:55] not sure
[53:56] they're not sure of their salvation
[53:58] they're not sure of their conviction
[54:00] they're their commitment to Christ
[54:01] they're not sure so they're embarrassed
[54:04] because Amen to speak of something that
[54:07] they're not sure of they're not certain
[54:09] of so when they're speaking they don't
[54:11] it don't have no effect because they're
[54:14] embarrassed of it
[54:16] are you up man because of embarrassment
[54:19] because uh I'm not sure of what I
[54:22] believe and I'm not sure what I believe
[54:24] that I'm ashamed of it because I'm not
[54:27] convicted of it I'm not even convinced
[54:29] of it myself
[54:30] so why should I share with somebody else
[54:32] what I'm not sure of I'm not sure of any
[54:36] matter of my life and how I live I'm not
[54:38] sure of it
[54:40] am I really a Christian am I really
[54:42] saved am I really accepting the blood of
[54:45] Jesus Christ am I really wash am I
[54:48] really clean
[54:50] do I really take the gospel and let it
[54:53] be effective in my life I am not just
[54:55] going through the motion
[55:07] I'm not sure of who I am and what I am
[55:11] and what I'm standing for
[55:13] but when you're standing for something
[55:16] and you're certain of it
[55:18] amen you can take a boldness about
[55:20] yourself
[55:21] amen I believe that Paul had a boldness
[55:24] about amen the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[55:27] amen that I'm not ashamed of it
[55:30] praise God I'm not embarrassing them and
[55:32] I'm not intimidated by
[55:34] praise God hallelujah so
[55:37] Jesus came to a point and his disciples
[55:41] and those that were gathered around him
[55:43] that he wanted to talk to them about him
[55:46] let me talk to you Bob amen if you're
[55:49] gonna follow me
[55:51] praise God I know that amen we sometimes
[55:54] we've been falling for a season but I
[55:57] want to make sure that you understand
[55:58] the effect of what it takes to follow me
[56:08] for what I do for you but are you
[56:10] willing
[56:12] they're following me to pay the price
[56:15] you know I I talked about
[56:18] as I was praying are we ready are we
[56:21] willing to trust God with our life in
[56:24] his hand
[56:25] you know I
[56:27] we get on the plane and we fly amen from
[56:32] you know sometimes those long trips you
[56:34] got a long thinking you're over the
[56:36] ocean and I'm flying over the ocean and
[56:39] you know sometimes you're on those
[56:40] flights for uh 10 hours sometimes 18
[56:44] hours flights

[57:08] pilots
[57:10] are you up there and we sit down and
[57:13] relax
[57:15] but we're not willing to uh to trust God
[57:18] enough to put our life in his hand
[57:21] and say Lord I'm headed for Glory
[57:24] and I'm trusting you to get me there
[57:27] are you a man but we think that it's
[57:31] something that we're gonna do to get the
[57:33] plane Amen to our destination
[57:36] but it's nothing that you can do you
[57:38] just sit back and relax it's the
[57:40] paladiness
[57:42] amen so what I'm saying is the holy
[57:45] spirit that you attracting to get you
[57:48] from Earth to Glory
[57:49] it's God Amen that's going to teach you
[57:52] that

[58:31] after a while
[58:33] you know because I'm used to you know
[58:35] flying and you know you go through a
[58:38] little tournament everything between the
[58:40] calm down
[58:41] but the plane Shook and Rock
[58:44] from England all of you back to the
[58:47] state
[58:49] and I said that's the first time I had a
[58:51] flight when they tried to go above the
[58:54] turbulence under the turbulence no
[58:56] matter which way they go it was still
[58:58] rocking and you're talking about folks
[59:01] were drinking that's when the drinks was
[59:02] free
[59:05] by the time we got there I believe
[59:07] everybody to drink was good and drunk

[59:13] tournaments you see sometimes amen but
[59:16] we're still we made it
[59:19] are you up there NASA on some flights it

[1:00:19] don't know
[1:00:21] you know what I'm saying but yet you
[1:00:24] still put your hand
[1:00:26] in the confidence of the Bible now that

[1:00:59] I'm trusting you in the midst of my
[1:01:01] travel time
[1:01:04] trusting you
[1:01:07] it's God
[1:01:09] there's no
[1:01:11] amen turning around and no getting out
[1:01:13] of this I made up my mind a long time
[1:01:16] ago

[1:02:24] in the midst of a mixed up world in the
[1:02:27] trouble World God's word stealing right
[1:02:30] praise God if we trust the word of God
[1:02:33] and we trust the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:36] he said ashamed of me
[1:02:38] in my word
[1:02:41] are you a man
[1:02:42] don't be ashamed of me and my wife
[1:02:46] because he is the word of one
[1:02:48] amen if you're ashamed of him your shame
[1:02:51] of his word
[1:02:53] and every hour amen we must recognize in
[1:02:57] every day and every hour that was a
[1:02:59] message that was a message in every hour
[1:03:01] Moses had a message for the people amen
[1:03:04] and Moses couldn't be ashamed of pharaoh
[1:03:07] are you with me he went down the Pharaoh
[1:03:10] and says God should let my people go
[1:03:13] Pharaoh said
[1:03:16] who you
[1:03:17] and who is this God
[1:03:19] that you you're standing for and see
[1:03:22] that's what you got to believe that the
[1:03:24] god that sent you amen that he's in you
[1:03:28] and greed is he that is in you
[1:03:30] that he that is in the world
[1:03:32] Amen to all hell might break out
[1:03:36] are you up there trouble might come out
[1:03:39] on your hand but you got to look up
[1:03:42] there's nothing I Look To The Hills
[1:03:45] as David said from which cometh my help
[1:03:48] for my help comes from the Lord
[1:03:50] Lord I'm in your hand i'm trashing you
[1:03:53] now
[1:03:54] well yes with trouble causing the
[1:03:56] squeeze come on
[1:03:57] things don't look like it's going right
[1:04:00] well I still trust in you Lord
[1:04:03] oh I'm depending on God regardless
[1:04:06] so Moses went down and look like
[1:04:10] look at this you know I'm just water and
[1:04:14] I'm looking at a a king that's over the
[1:04:17] world and Pharaoh that conquered alien
[1:04:20] Nations when I'm coming down and of
[1:04:23] people that's in slavery and bondage
[1:04:25] amen a lot of Great Men probably were
[1:04:28] there and women and amen but I'm coming
[1:04:31] down as a one-man invasion
[1:04:34] you know I'm not ashamed for what I come
[1:04:37] to represent in the word that God has
[1:04:39] given me is in my mouth
[1:04:42] I'm talking about the word of God for
[1:04:45] the hour you live in must be in your
[1:04:47] mouth
[1:04:48] for your word in the hour you live in
[1:04:51] will bear a reproach because it would be
[1:04:54] what it takes to defeat the Devil in the
[1:04:56] time you live in
[1:04:58] are you a man
[1:05:00] so you must be convinced that I got what
[1:05:02] it takes
[1:05:04] praise God to divide in
[1:05:08] it now tell the devil you can't harm me
[1:05:15] that's not my anointed
[1:05:18] do my prophets no harm
[1:05:20] Hallelujah because you've got
[1:05:22] stimulation of the revelation
[1:05:25] amen you know where you stand you know
[1:05:27] what you believe
[1:05:29] amen praise God you're not just
[1:05:32] oh
[1:05:34] I go down here
[1:05:36] pharaoh
[1:05:39] God say
[1:05:41] let his people go
[1:05:47] you gonna do it
[1:05:50] maybe you will
[1:05:52] maybe you won't
[1:05:55] but I see oh God say you know how you
[1:06:00] when you're intimidating you're not
[1:06:01] certain you speak with hesitation they
[1:06:03] can tell in your voice telling the
[1:06:05] mannerism in which you express yourself
[1:06:07] that you ain't certain
[1:06:11] but it's something that Moses I believe
[1:06:13] he went with his head up
[1:06:16] with his rod in his hand
[1:06:18] I believe that he went with confidence
[1:06:21] because he had met God
[1:06:24] in a burning bush
[1:06:27] and God had revealed himself to him
[1:06:30] and he knew the hour had come and it was
[1:06:32] a time for the children of Israel
[1:06:35] they were supposed to be in bonded for
[1:06:37] 430 years and 400 years he said after
[1:06:40] that I am coming down and I will deliver
[1:06:43] them but Moses didn't know that God was
[1:06:45] going to use him to do it
[1:06:48] amen but his mother and father he was a
[1:06:51] proper child and he put him in a bastard
[1:06:55] are you up man
[1:06:56] so amen praise God not all together
[1:07:00] understanding how God's going to use you
[1:07:04] what God is going to do in your life how
[1:07:06] your life is going to be even a reproach
[1:07:09] to the enemy how are you going to be
[1:07:11] able to bear
[1:07:14] as he left of God and as those were
[1:07:18] clean and procrastinated before the
[1:07:20] foundation of the world they'll stand up
[1:07:22] for adultery
[1:07:26] send for an adulterous generation
[1:07:28] that you would be a standard
[1:07:31] your life will stand as a standard
[1:07:34] praise God in this generation God has
[1:07:37] some amen young people something and not
[1:07:41] all the people elderly people God not
[1:07:44] somebody that would take a stand
[1:07:47] in a Quicken and precise generation but
[1:07:50] God got him in a chosen generation
[1:07:52] around your priesthood somebody that
[1:07:55] gonna take a stand
[1:07:56] somebody they're gonna say God I'll take
[1:07:59] up my cross
[1:08:00] and I Will Follow You Lord I'm willing
[1:08:03] Lord I'm not ashamed
[1:08:06] of the Gospel
[1:08:08] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:08:11] Christ
[1:08:12] somebody that's going to take a stand
[1:08:15] but there'll be many that says
[1:08:18] it passes right over the head
[1:08:21] because
[1:08:22] even though it's not resonating
[1:08:24] it's not really touching
[1:08:27] Jesus
[1:08:29] is not worth it
[1:08:33] the world is offering us too much
[1:08:36] too much Glam or too much glow
[1:08:40] the world is often too much
[1:08:42] too many shiny things
[1:08:44] the devil is offering you too much
[1:08:48] because if you go God
[1:08:50] way it's going to be God's despite its
[1:08:53] way it's going to be a straight and
[1:08:55] narrow way
[1:08:56] the way of a Christian
[1:08:58] when he said my yoke is easy my burden
[1:09:00] is life
[1:09:02] amen but the joy that he gives us
[1:09:05] the peace and assurance that
[1:09:07] praise God don't we go through things
[1:09:09] somebody say oh you're willing
[1:09:12] I'll tell you what
[1:09:14] if I could change
[1:09:19] a nickel
[1:09:21] and get a billion dollars
[1:09:25] it'd be something wrong with me not to
[1:09:26] do it
[1:09:28] I got five cents
[1:09:30] and I can change it and I can get a
[1:09:32] billion dollars for about five cents
[1:09:36] you know it'd be something wrong with me
[1:09:38] out of the ordinary if I wouldn't do it
[1:09:42] if all I had to do was give you this
[1:09:44] five cents
[1:09:46] and I I can have a billion dollars
[1:09:49] all I have to do is take this old filthy
[1:09:51] life this pest house that's by reason
[1:09:54] the strength is three four years and ten
[1:09:56] but and by reading the four score years
[1:09:59] and 80 years and if you live a hundred
[1:10:01] it's just borrowed years
[1:10:03] and I can have eternal life
[1:10:06] it'd be something wrong with me if I
[1:10:09] would not take eternal life in exchange
[1:10:12] for this life and say Lord I give you
[1:10:14] this uh this 80 years or this hundred
[1:10:18] years I give you that for eternity
[1:10:22] I I brought that changing he said what
[1:10:25] prophet a man the what
[1:10:27] gain the whole world and what
[1:10:29] those are soul your soul gonna spend
[1:10:32] eternity with God
[1:10:34] amen but in in the meantime you escape
[1:10:38] it was told a story about a a young
[1:10:42] young lady coming home from college
[1:10:44] and with their friends on the train
[1:10:47] and she came over college with her
[1:10:48] friends on the train
[1:10:50] and her mother was there to meet her
[1:10:53] and uh they saw her the friends on the
[1:10:57] train they saw her mother there and the
[1:11:01] mother had been in a fire and got burnt
[1:11:05] and she looked just you know someone you

[1:11:10] face and all in
[1:11:11] and the girls on the on the train was

[1:11:17] woman looked ooh she looked a mess
[1:11:19] you know oh
[1:11:21] shoot she was like and they didn't know
[1:11:23] that that was a young lady's mother
[1:11:26] and then
[1:11:28] and the girl she was ashamed
[1:11:30] to let them know that that's my mama
[1:11:34] you see what I'm saying
[1:11:36] and
[1:11:37] kind of
[1:11:39] to know that
[1:11:41] when when a mama wanted to greet her off
[1:11:43] the train
[1:11:45] you know she almost like who that lady
[1:11:48] is you know I want to avoid her
[1:11:51] you know
[1:11:53] but
[1:11:55] somebody I almost wanted to remind this
[1:11:57] young lady
[1:11:58] the reason why your mama is in the
[1:12:01] condition that she was in
[1:12:03] the house caught on the Fire
[1:12:07] and she was left in the house and the
[1:12:09] marble went in to save her
[1:12:12] and her mama ended up getting burnt
[1:12:15] because the mama saved her life
[1:12:18] are you a man
[1:12:21] instead of happy and thankful she was
[1:12:23] ashamed
[1:12:24] not knowing the amen that
[1:12:27] she could have been dead she could have
[1:12:29] been gone
[1:12:30] are you up man
[1:12:32] Jesus the gospel that you reject
[1:12:36] the gospel that you don't want nothing
[1:12:38] to do whatever because people laugh at
[1:12:41] him
[1:12:43] these people decide to reject in the
[1:12:46] Bible said that's obedient we should
[1:12:48] desire him
[1:12:50] he went to hell and went to amen and the
[1:12:54] Pains of hell he said got a hold of me
[1:12:57] he felt the pain and added in one of his
[1:13:00] life to be judged at the center
[1:13:10] he was embarrassed he was a bit to save
[1:13:13] our
[1:13:14] City
[1:13:17] amen he was acquainted with priests and
[1:13:19] abandoned himself
[1:13:21] and we're here that's why our faces from
[1:13:23] him
[1:13:25] praise God
[1:13:28] we didn't want him maybe he said if not
[1:13:31] with the cross of Jesus
[1:13:33] a king that was rejected
[1:13:38] the Bible said he came to his own people
[1:13:40] and they said
[1:13:47] the king of the Jews
[1:13:50] and they said he's not our King
[1:13:54] because they look for their King to be
[1:13:56] valid
[1:13:57] they stand up and attitude judgment
[1:14:01] the rule when I wrote a hand but they
[1:14:04] said he's not our King
