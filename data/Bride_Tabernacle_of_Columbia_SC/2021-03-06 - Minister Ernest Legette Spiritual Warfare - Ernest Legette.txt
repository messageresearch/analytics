amen god is good amen amen we want to look at the book of ephesians tonight by god's grace ephesians 6. very familiar scripture ephesians 6 and we'll begin here at the 10th first if you got it say amen and it reads finally my brethren uh be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all stand stand therefore having your loins girt with bout with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to stay able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints for and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly and make known the mystery of the gospel for i for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak may god has blessed to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to i want to minister on a topic and i entitled it spiritual warfare amen spiritual warfare you know i i said that sometimes we lose the we lose the the thought process of that we're constantly in the battle we're constantly every day we wake up we're in a battle we're not battling like the bible says this isn't a flesh and blood affair but it's a spiritual battle he talked about spiritual wickedness in high places you know and things he says that we wrestle not against spirits flesh and blood but against spiritual principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you know i i believe that and everything that would exalt itself i would say against the knowledge of god we're fighting against it today and we lose that we lose that mind frame sometime that we ain't on a picnic but we're on a battlefield and we're fighting so you know at the times we think that it's a peace remember we're still in battle we're still in war the devil the devil ain't gonna stop from warning against you your flesh ain't gonna stop from warning against you and that's why it says that we got to die daily as long as you here we go we're gonna be in a battle we're gonna be in a fight with this flesh how many believe that tonight but i like how paul here is breaking it down to the church he says that you know he says i want you to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might don't try to you know don't try to fight your own battles you try to fight your own battles then you'll lose remember the bible said that the battle the battle angel ain't yours but it's the lord's how many believe that tonight and that's what we learned to i was sharing with the church and sumter the other day i said you know once you got to learn to give it to god i says you know uh uh i had to learn that as an individual and still learning every day how to give things to god you know you feel a lot better when you learn how to release things to god you can walk around with these heavy weights and these things that clouds you down and and they have you in so much bondage that you can't do as you ought to for the lord you can't even praise god like you want to you can't function in the spirit realm like you want to because of these weights and these things that's hank that's that's that's holding you down maybe some natural affliction or whatever it might be it might be a a health affliction or whatever it might be nevertheless remember this ain't nothing dealing with flesh and blood but it's is spiritual battles the devil is is is doing his best to keep you from fulfilling the will of god in your life he'll give you all kind of uh he'll do all kind of things into you in your life that'll create or cause you to create excuses to why you ain't functioning god's program like you ought to he'll give you all kind of excuses i'm tired my body don't feel come on but i want to say you know jesus he pressed on anyhow how many believe that tonight when we look in the book of hebrews and many throughout all of scripture we got so many clouds of witnesses that against the grain against all odds they still were able to fulfill what god had ordained for their life because they learned how to press on how many believe that tonight so let's not have excuses to why we can't do what god asks us to do less against the grain say lord i'm gonna do what you asked me to do if i got to lose everything if i got to give up friendship if i got to give up this or that lord i'm going to do what you asked me to do because i'm here for one purpose and that is it's written of me god to do thy will hallelujah how many believe that tonight come on he said it's written of me to do your will hallelujah i was created you know what we were created for prophet god talked about we were created to worship come on god wants worship out of you god is an object of worship you you don't have an excuse why you can't worship god if you got uh life come on tonight the bible says that everything that have breath do what praise the lord i always talk about how me and brother gerald were down in the swamp and it's real loud back there all of the frogs and the owls and everything going on and and i asked them i was just kind of joking way i said you reckon they praising the lord making all that noise and he said brother ernest he says the bible says let everything that have breath praise the lord come on i believe they doing what god created them to do and long as you and i have breath in our bodies tonight you don't have no excuse why you can't praise the lord the song leader shouldn't have to prompt you to praise the lord you got breath you ought to say hallelujah anyhow how many believe that tonight come on you know you feel better when you do what god created you to do hallelujah because what he showers you with his presence his presence come down and he showered you he said yes they doing what i created them to do how many feel like doing what god created them to do hallelujah how many feel like pressing your way through anyhow raising your hands anyhow say hallelujah anyhow come on no matter what ours is against me how many believe that tonight but i said what it is a spiritual battle you know i was challenging the church the other day i said i said you know you know uh it's it's a challenge i says that you lift your hands no matter what you're going through you just lift your hands anyhow no matter what you face with i said i challenge you this morning just to lift your hands and just see what god will do come on and you know you can feel the presence of god coming down among the congregation why because god is accepting that god is accepting when you defy it come on instead i was i was talking to guys at work the day i was just flicking around with them i said you know all this complaining and whining and i said it just contaminates the whole atmosphere the whole atmosphere just contaminated i said man y'all starting to rub off on me listening to all this complaining and whining i say the thing about it is it contaminates the atmosphere i said then when you come to work you can't even enjoy the shelf doing the things that you do at work because the atmosphere is so contaminated i said we got to change the atmosphere in here no matter what we got to find a way to change the atmosphere in here come on and everybody seem to be like joking around loud said that's what it is you know atmosphere makes a big difference come on people can be feeling bad but the atmosphere makes a big difference i believe that with all of my heart you people can be down but when they walk into the right atmosphere something changed with what they going through they might have had had problems but they forgot all about their problems might have had a headache forgot all about the headache but body hurting forgot all about it when they act when they walked into the right atmosphere hallelujah how many believe that tonight i believe that what i said is what it is we in the spiritual war come on we in the battle we're fighting we're not against flesh and blood i like how paul says here at the end of when he was talking about putting on the whole arm of god and talking about faith and all this i like how he says i want you to pray always come on i want you to always be down on your knees praying i believe that's the key to the battle we in how you gonna fight the enemy that you can't see how you gonna fight the enemy that a lot of times you don't have no knowledge because what's going on while we're while we're sitting here going about our daily life it's deeming powers on the outside looking in it's spiritual wickedness in high places while you laying at sleep at night devising a way of how i'm going to destroy your day when you get up in the morning or how i'm going to turn this person's world upside down come on while you're sleeping at night principalities powers is fighting against you they trying to infiltrate your spirit while you sleep when you wake up in the morning come on but what it is he said i want you to pray always hallelujah when we get down on our knees and pray what do we say lord i need you to fight this battle for me god i'm headed to this day i don't know what's ahead of me lord but i'm gonna put it in your hands god lord as i walk today lord you take hold of my footsteps as i talk today lord take hold of my mouth lord make the way for me how many believe that this is smart tonight when i say that's what it is you know demon powers you know they they in high places devise another way to destroy you devise another way to cause you to get out the will of god that they can have an accusation against you before god look at what they did look at what they did but i thank god for his blood tonight that when god looks at us he don't see those things as long as our heart is right hallelujah he looks at the blood how many believe that and i said spiritual warfare i like how he says praying always with prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching therefore with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and then he throws uh in the 19th verse he says and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly i thought that was something i says that paul asked the people to pray for he says when you're praying remember me that i might be able to open my mouth boldly to speak to you oh i thought today how the ministry needs your prayer the man of god he needs your prayer you know because not only is he fighting the same battle you fighting but it's even more sometime a demon powers a spiritual wickedness to do what to get him not to open his mouth boldly to get him to deviate from the word of god here deviate from the word of god there then in the end what it is he gonna be have to give an account for each and every one soul he gonna have to give an account for what he said and what he didn't say come on paul said pray for me that i could speak boldly and i believe that's the prayer of all the ministry today that you pray for them i know that's my prayer that you pray for me sometimes as an individual might not understand the weight that's on the ministry might not understand that sometimes in the ministry you feel uh helpless sometimes because you're doing all you can do coronavirus hitting and you still preaching that god is a healer people are dying all around you but you still declaring that god is a healer you still declaring that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever critics are all over the land but yet you're still declaring it hallelujah and nevertheless i still don't doubt it why because i believe that god will back it up you said how that because god he keeps his word hallelujah how many believe that tonight but i believe that paul like he says here he says remember me come on in prayer and i pray that night that you remember me as i remember you come on why because we fight in a battle it's demon powers it's power's out there it says that you know a lot of times we could just skip on down i says that you know satan's got all kind of tactics that he loves to use and one of the tactics he like to use is fear he likes to use fear he used fear to you you use fear the bible says that he calls you the the love not fear he says the fear has what it has torment the devil will use fear to torment you he'll use fear to you he'll use fear to take your your uh a vision of faith away that you can't see uh uh through the eyes of faith but you would only be able to see the things that you could physically see with your natural eyes so sometimes we have to find a way to close our natural eyes and look through the eyes of faith god i'm looking past all of what i see and when you look past or what all you see and what happens faith draws the victory now unto you come on i believe that david says uh though i walk through the valley in the shadow of death he said i will what i will fear no evil come on though he walking through that valley in that shadow of death how can he not fear because he can't be looking at the valley in the shadow of death he can't be looking at the demon powers that's out there trying to boom and scare them come on but he's got to somewhere find a way to get out of himself i believe that and get into a realm of faith the way he says i'm walking through these places but i know that thou art with me come on thou roared and my staff it comfort me god i know you're here in these places hallelujah then you can walk through those valleys and those shadows of death when everybody else is looking at you and don't know what you're doing you know where you are you ride in the masters hands you know where you are the ship is being tossed the winds are blowing but you know the anchor holes how many believe that tonight hallelujah i said that's what it is walking through those valleys shadow dell he said i won't fear no evil come on one of the take satan's tactic is is fear he'll use fear to you a lot of times fear will make you say things that you ought not say fear and make you react in ways that you ought not react then why because you you fear gripped your heart you got scared and you you've done things that you shouldn't have done why because fear gripped your heart i believe that i says you know thinking about israel and how you know uh god had done so many great things for him but what happened uh when when the spies came back from the land ten of them had an evil report and what did it did that evil report contaminated the minds of the people contaminated the atmosphere got the whole atmosphere messed up because of what they said hey and the thing is they didn't say that they were uh grasshoppers in the giants eyes they said but we in our own sight in our own eyes were like grasshoppers in their sight come on they were looking at themselves and what it is it caused a fear to grip those people fear grip those people in such a way that it it it tormented them and handicapped them until they started saying all kinds of things they started saying things like moses why you didn't leave us in egypt to die come on why did you bring us all out here what happened fear done that fear the bible said they cried all night long fear tormented the people not realizing like joshua and caleb was telling them the land is just like god said it is yeah it might be giants in the land but look at what already god has done for us come on we are more than able then then to defeat the giants that's against us why because we didn't get here on our own in the first place it was god in the beginning and it's god now hallelujah and that's the way i look at situations even today i said god didn't bring me this far to leave me come on i just can't give up now he brought me too far hallelujah from where i started from though the giants might be in the land i ain't the one that brought myself here i ain't the one that saved myself and delivered myself from the light that i was in it was god then and it'll be god now hallelujah oh jesus mountains have gotten bigger hallelujah but my god is even bigger oh god how many believe that tonight hallelujah you know i don't know about you but i says god what he did i preached the bestest one time god rising to the occasion god is bigger than your mountain god is speaking in the trial you're going through god is bigger than the things you're facing tonight my god is so big not even death can conquer him hallelujah but he conquered death in the grave and he said if you know that same spirit that raised jesus from the dead if it dwell in you then it'll quicken your mortal body not even the mountain of death can stand before god how many believe that tonight if that's true then we are more than conquerors what can stand who can stand before you hallelujah tonight how many believe that tonight i said what it is fear made them do all those things you know the the ten spies like i said it created an image in their mind caused him to be in fear now i realize but joshua and caleb realized that david realized that when he had to go face goliath come on this wasn't a natural battle he says what the problem did what you did you called god out come on you called god out and god rose to the occasion didn't he god stepped on the scene don't you know the world today is calling god out come on they're saying where be uh uh the lord and saying like he delayed his coming that's all for fathers of old what are they doing they calling god out come on somebody says where if god be god and where is all those miracles god's gonna rise to the occasion come on god is rising to the occasion right now we still got testimonies god is still healing god is still doing the same thing he's been doing hallelujah you calling god out but he rising to the occasion he ain't dead hallelujah somebody said it's been so many years it's this and that come on but god is still god i believe that how many believe that tonight and he'll show himself to those that believe to those that look for us appearing they'll see them the second time i don't know about you but i'm looking for his appearance i'm looking for god to show up and do what he said to you do hallelujah looking for god i says what it is you know the bible says that men's heart was going to fail for fear come on what it is the devil using that fear like it says you don't want you to fear but have faith a lot of times i says what happens a lot of times we fear because we don't trust god you have fear because you don't trust god you don't trust him you know i was thinking about the children of israel and i said that when they came to the land and all these things happening and you know god even told moses he says that this generation they do error in their ways come on they earn he says that you know at one point all that all that i did and i proved myself all these times and still yet they don't believe me still yet fear still can grip their heart in a way to where they can make statements like that why because even after all of god trying and proving that wasn't enough to get them to believe come on and even today sometimes it ain't enough to get the people to believe sometimes it ain't enough the the way you can be self sold out and settled to what god has done god if you don't do nothing else you already done enough you you can't never get to that point so but god is so merciful he keep doing things and doing things to do what to try to open your eyes to let you see that hey i'm god trust me i'm still all-powerful yes sir i'm that living god come on these things before you are are the testing to try you come on to bring out a character in you that i put in you from the beginning of time hallelujah but we don't want to face our mountains we don't want to face our trials and tribulations we won't go but we don't want it to go through the fire hallelujah a hot guy gonna purge it if it don't go through the fire it's got to go through the fire to burn out the impurities burn out the things that's not like him hallelujah then when we come forth we'll come forth as pure gold hallelujah something that god wants to show off somebody that god can say i took them through the fire and they still here today hallelujah they're still standing they ain't knocked down they're still standing they're still worshipping me they still got their praise they still got this shout hallelujah the fire has gone through the gold i mean the gold has gone through the fight how many believe that tonight sometimes we look at the trials that we go through and seem to be so hard but i don't know about you but i start learning the joy in the things that i'm going through because one day i'm gonna look back and i'm gonna say look at what god has done i believe that hallelujah israel on the other side of the right seat the bible says that miriam took a tambourine and getting shouting and moses sang a good song hallelujah god is good anyhow how many believe that tonight oh jesus don't worry about what you're faced with right now hallelujah don't worry about the struggles and the battles you're going through right now hallelujah praise god anyhow god is doing something in your life oh jesus i like that saying on that song when god get through with me hallelujah please be patient with me i ask you to be patient with me tonight god ain't through with me yet hallelujah but when god get through with me i said when god get through with you hallelujah you'll come forth as pure gold how many believe that tonight oh jesus hallelujah don't you feel like going on tonight don't you feel like traveling on come on we're in a battle we're in a spiritual war hallelujah but paul said put your war clothes on and let's go to battle put your wardrobes on let's start fighting hallelujah we got demons to fight hallelujah we got spiritual wickedness to fight hallelujah how many believe that tonight that says what it is a lot of times we fear because we don't trust god i don't know about you but i said god you already done enough hallelujah god you don't have to prove yourself to me not one more time god i know you you said i'll never leave you nor forsake you so even with what you're faced with come on god made promises to you you hold on to those promises the promise the biggest promise we're looking for is the promise of the rapture hallelujah god to take us out of here how many believe that tonight that one day you'll hear that voice one day you'll hear something that you recognize hallelujah it'll catch you up and take you away i believe that with all of my heart do you believe that tonight amen [Music] praise god amen god is good amen we're on a wall we're on a wall amen let's get let's fight the good fight of faith he said to lay hold on eternal life amen cynthia said i know it's worth it to make heaven my home amen is worth my dying it's worth my crime i know it's worth it praise god the wife was talking about the zombies they're expecting a a pandemic or in the future where people will look like zombies and um the bible said the last horse ride of the ride is death and hell you know and i said death is going to be walking through the streets of america in the world people amen going to look like death and it's coming but thank god that god got a hiding place for the children of god the plagues are hitting the earth but god to fear not little flaw it is your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen went on amen when all these things he said look up for your redemption drawing nah praise god i believe that amen the things that the prophet said uh cancer would be like a two thing concerning the pledge is gonna hit so i'm saying amen if cancer gonna be like a toothache brother and sister what in store for this world amen but you ought to see what god has in reserve for you amen god got a place amen that he's going to hide you amen in the secrets of his tabernacle shall he hide me amen god got a hiding place for you amen praise god people would run to the rocks in the mountains and they said fall on us hide us from the face of him that set it on the throne amen there'll be many crying in that day they mean i wish i would've it'll be too late they're going to be many people amen said lord amen take me out of here i don't want to be in this pain i tell you it's going to be a sad day brother and sister i want to be ready what about you amen what you got to do you got to start fighting now i noticed my wife she was listening about three o'clock this morning and four o'clock this morning and listening to the message and i said i was just praying and praying and i realized that i couldn't sleep and didn't know she couldn't sleep either i said it's time to pray and then she was listening i told him i didn't talk at all i just told him i said man i was listening to the prophet myself and i was praying i said i don't know what's coming i said but something's coming amen i said it's time to pray and she said that's all i could do is just pray and pray i said brother and sister if you ain't praying it's time to pray because it's coming amen praise god i i said we can't help amen we can pray amen that we can escape but whatever's going to come it's going to come amen because he said evil men and us your watch works inwards amen he said they are perilous time going to come why because men don't love god no more their love of them themselves the love is a pleasure more than lovers of god and because we're in the last and evil days amen praise god and we realize the devil amen he's trying to receive as many as he can amen he's trying he's trying to divide as many as he can if the devil can convince you not to praise god he'll convince you that you don't need to praise the lord amen and that's what folks are amen they're getting in a habit amen they got time for everything else but they don't have time for god amen but while you have an opportunity to praise the lord you need to praise him why you got to change i was sitting there and listening to brother ernest and i said thank the lord that i can i was telling brother nathan i said thank the lord i can walk without pain amen because you know sometimes you you can't even walk and all kind of pain hitting you and your legs
