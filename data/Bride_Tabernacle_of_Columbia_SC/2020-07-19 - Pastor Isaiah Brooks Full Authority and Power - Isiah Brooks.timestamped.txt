[27:34] my friend said to me before she passed
[27:36] on she said brother Brooks I really
[27:40] enjoyed talking with you because when we
[27:44] talk on the phone all you do is talk
[27:45] about the scripture in the Word of God
[27:47] and I told her where that's my life it's
[27:51] what I live with
[27:52] live by and live from and Jesus Christ
[27:57] is my champion this morning for those
[27:59] who are listening and you have not made
[28:01] Jesus Christ your choice the greatest
[28:04] thing you can do in this life does not
[28:07] make a million dollars or business the
[28:13] best choice that a man can make in this
[28:15] life is to make Jesus Christ his choice
[28:17] because that choice will never fade away
[28:20] he'll never die that choice will live
[28:23] with you throughout eternity we thank

[31:13] come to God
[31:16] [Music]
[32:11] the Bible says that heaven and earth
[32:15] shall pass away but the word of the Lord
[32:19] shall stand as I said earlier I'm glad
[32:23] to be here by the grace of God I want to
[32:27] be used by the Lord in any way he
[32:30] chooses to use me
[32:32] I'm nothing of myself everything that I
[32:36] am is because of the Lord Jesus we
[32:40] appreciate our pastor reeling in you're
[32:43] Simmons for allowing us to be here to
[32:45] entrust us to stand at the pulpit this
[32:49] morning we realize by God's grace I'm
[32:54] not worthy to stand before the desk but
[32:57] God has made me worthy not prolonging
[33:00] the time we want to get right into the
[33:02] Word of God I trusted them all will
[33:05] bless you this morning I know we're
[33:07] living in a crucial time we're living at
[33:09] a time where fear has gripped the hearts
[33:12] of many believers as well as
[33:14] non-believers but I hope some way and
[33:17] somehow that the Lord will bless you as
[33:20] we stand we going to ask you to turn
[33:24] with us amen to revelations to fifth
[33:26] chapter if you had a place where you
[33:28] can't stand you ought to stand in honor
[33:29] of the word as I when I'm at home I'll
[33:34] tell the people that no matter where you
[33:36] are you ought to be in church churches
[33:40] are a particular place like a local
[33:45] building but churches actually in your
[33:48] heart and wherever you are it ought to
[33:51] be a place of church but Christ could
[33:54] come and minister by God's grace and if
[33:56] you don't mind I'm just gonna take this
[33:58] jacket off being that it is outside and
[34:00] it's quite warm I trust that it's okay
[34:03] with you by God's grace you love the
[34:05] Lord amen coming from revelations to the
[34:08] fifth chapter we'll begin at the sixth
[34:11] verse and we'll read down to the eighth
[34:13] verse and I beheld and lo in the midst
[34:17] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[34:19] in the midst of the
[34:21] to the lamb as it had been slain having
[34:23] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[34:26] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[34:30] the earth and he came and took the book
[34:33] out of the right hand of him that sat
[34:35] upon the throne and when he had taken
[34:37] the book the four beasts and four and
[34:40] twenty elders fell down before the lamb
[34:41] having every one of them harps and
[34:44] golden vials full of odours which are
[34:47] the prayers of the saints
[34:50] amen one more scripture coming from
[34:52] revelations 10 we're living in a time as
[34:55] you turn we're living there at a time
[34:57] when God is doing some great things and
[35:00] I am so glad to be part of this drama
[35:03] amen the reason why I say it like that
[35:06] because I know the way the story ends
[35:09] amen revelations 10 beginning at the
[35:12] eighth verse and the voice which I heard
[35:14] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[35:17] go and take the little book which is
[35:20] open in the hand of the angel which
[35:23] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[35:25] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[35:27] Him give me a little book and he said to
[35:30] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[35:33] make that belly bitter but it shall be
[35:36] in that mouth sweet as honey and I took
[35:39] the little book out of the right out of
[35:41] the Angels hand and ate it up and it was
[35:45] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon
[35:47] as I had eaten it my belly was bitter
[35:50] and he said it to be thou must prophesy
[35:54] again before many peoples and nations
[35:56] and tongues and kings one more scripture
[36:00] please if you don't mind turn with me
[36:01] quickly to Romans 8 we read the twenty
[36:05] ninth first twenty nine to the thirtieth
[36:12] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[36:15] predestinate and he to be conformed to
[36:20] the image of the of his son that he
[36:23] might be the firstborn among many
[36:25] brethren moreover who he did
[36:28] predestinate them he also called and
[36:30] whom he called them he also justified
[36:33] and whom he justified them he also
[36:36] glorified let us pray Heavenly Father we
[36:40] come before you we thank you for your
[36:42] grace and your mercy you are our
[36:44] protector Lord we have no fear because
[36:49] perfect love has cast out the fear we
[36:53] thank you for your grace we thank you
[36:55] for your mercy we thank you for your
[36:57] love divine we just pray father God that
[37:00] you have preeminence here this morning
[37:02] speak to our our heart speak to our lips
[37:06] give us Lord everything that the
[37:08] listener need hallelujah need to hear
[37:11] this morning anoint yoga so Lord through
[37:15] and through from the soul through the
[37:17] spirit to the flesh have thine own way
[37:20] have complete control this morning and
[37:22] will be careful to give you the praise
[37:24] glory and honor and your lovely name
[37:26] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[37:29] seated and those who are you cause you
[37:31] me by God's grace return into your house
[37:34] if you like we want to minister this
[37:36] morning the message full authority and
[37:41] power one thing I know is that God is a
[37:47] God of War he knows how to put us in a
[37:54] place where we must battle this battle
[38:00] that we're talking about is something
[38:02] that began before time we understand
[38:07] that Lucifer raised up against Christ in
[38:13] the beginning of time and we understand
[38:17] by God's grace that Micah Amen thought
[38:22] and overcame the dragon and right now
[38:26] we're living in a time where we are now
[38:30] coming to the culmination we're coming
[38:34] to the peak of this great event God
[38:39] against Satan intellectualism against
[38:44] faith we realize this morning that faith
[38:49] has always been the victory faith can
[38:55] move mountains faith can change
[38:59] situations that scientists say cannot be
[39:03] changed faith is the substance of things
[39:07] hoped for and the evidence of things not
[39:10] seen
[39:11] faith is real faith is more real than
[39:16] sight it's more real than touch it's
[39:21] more real than any of our physical
[39:24] senses but only a few people knows how
[39:30] to exercise this faith when we talk
[39:35] about full authority that means that God
[39:38] has restored mankind this is what
[39:41] Calvary was all about you and I must
[39:45] realize by God's grace that there's
[39:47] something in a man that cries out and
[39:50] allows him to know that he's not what he
[39:53] desire to be there's something about him
[39:55] that he knows that he's not supposed to
[39:57] be in bondage he's not supposed to be
[39:59] enslaved he is supposed to be a ruler
[40:04] God made Adam a ruler he ruled the
[40:08] garden he he was lord over the garden
[40:11] but after he fell we felt fell we have
[40:15] now fallen into this horrifying state no
[40:21] real man enjoy being a sinner no real
[40:25] man a woman enjoy being controlled by
[40:28] something a man that he cannot control
[40:30] himself we love freedom and you and I
[40:35] must understand
[40:36] that God is doing something great we
[40:40] look at the coronavirus and everything
[40:42] that is going on and we understand how
[40:46] people are afraid and we understand how
[40:48] things are happening and people are
[40:51] dying but people die every day and we
[40:55] realize they men that there's something
[40:57] that God is trying to do father believer
[41:00] God never brings a challenge to a
[41:04] believer and not take the challenge when
[41:12] we're talking about people we must
[41:14] understand and I love to preach but I
[41:17] realize I'm limited for time and but but
[41:20] there is a covenant people there's a
[41:23] people here today that is protected by
[41:27] God we understand something that others
[41:32] don't understand I was thinking about
[41:34] the book of Revelation and I understand
[41:36] that there are so many different
[41:38] interpretations of Revelation men of
[41:41] intellectual minds have truly messed it
[41:43] up because everybody is looking for
[41:46] these great beasts and these great
[41:48] monsters to come and they fail to see
[41:51] that will not just in the book of
[41:53] Revelation but we're almost at the end
[41:55] of it many things have already occurred
[41:59] hallelujah people talk about the mark of
[42:01] the beast and the mark of the beast have
[42:03] been going on for thousands of years
[42:05] people talking about these great things
[42:08] that are happening but they fail to see
[42:10] amen we're in between the second woe and
[42:13] the third woe the first war was the
[42:16] world war one hallelujah the second woe
[42:20] was world war two
[42:21] we're right in between the second row
[42:24] and the third row in other words would
[42:26] you believe what you're saying right in
[42:28] between in other words we are at the
[42:30] time of a rapture but you and I must
[42:34] understand it is it is at the time when
[42:37] people will relax is when God comes you
[42:42] know I have never seen it like this
[42:43] before where the whole world has been
[42:46] shut down by what we call
[42:49] virus I'm recalling the time amen when
[42:53] all the leads that was shut down by
[42:56] plagues and viruses but during that time
[42:59] instead of being covered by a facemask
[43:02] they had to make sure they were covered
[43:04] by the blood because jesus said when I
[43:07] see the blood I pass over you and the
[43:11] blood still lives the life of the blood
[43:15] which is Jesus Christ himself we're at a
[43:19] time it meant that this time has given
[43:22] unto you the pride of Jesus Christ to
[43:24] make sure that the blood the token life
[43:27] has been applied to your life hallelujah
[43:31] I rest in the name of Jesus Christ what
[43:36] we need to do is learn how to turn on
[43:39] your faith button can I say it like that
[43:42] God pushes you into a corner he makes
[43:46] you fight hallelujah even when you don't
[43:49] want to fight God will make you fight
[43:51] because he wants to bring out the
[43:53] warrior that's in you you and I Amen
[43:57] don't remember but when Lucifer came to
[44:00] a place to overthrow Christ we were with
[44:03] Christ then and we'll with Christ now
[44:06] you and I must understand that will not
[44:09] just natural beings but with
[44:11] supernatural beings hallelujah with a
[44:14] supernatural faith hallelujah with the
[44:17] supernatural God and God if he's
[44:21] supernatural he was supernatural
[44:23] yesterday
[44:24] he's supernatural today hallelujah and
[44:28] he will ever be supernatural y'all
[44:31] believe that I asked my question I asked
[44:34] my church I said which one would you
[44:36] rather stand and fight would you rather
[44:39] be like Daniel in the lion's den or
[44:44] would you rather be Amen like the Hebrew
[44:46] boys in the fiery furnace or would you
[44:50] rather span in Nero's chopping block or
[44:53] would you rather face Pharaoh and his
[44:55] army which one of these that you would
[44:58] fear hallelujah which one of these
[45:02] man that you were run from the challenge
[45:04] I want to tell you there are men of God
[45:07] there are women of God who stands for
[45:11] God who fights for God and they become
[45:15] victorious when the enemy comes in like
[45:18] a flood the Bible says that the Lord
[45:20] will lift up a standard against the
[45:23] devil I don't know about you but God has
[45:27] made me a standard oh by the grace of
[45:31] God I wear my mask when I need to but
[45:35] let me say it like this
[45:36] my mask is not protecting me it's the
[45:40] blood of Jesus it's my faith in God
[45:43] that's what protects me hallelujah we're
[45:46] at a time a meant that God is calling
[45:49] names who will fight for me if we must
[45:54] understand that we're in a great battle
[45:56] let me move on because I've got a jump
[45:58] you and I know that by God's grace that
[46:03] the very seals of God a revelation has
[46:05] already been open and when those seals
[46:08] were open in this day we realized that
[46:11] it gave man complete authority it
[46:14] brought him back to the full authority
[46:16] that Adam once had before the fall amen
[46:20] and God is looking for somebody whose
[46:23] faith can be quick so much so that they
[46:28] realize that it's not in other words
[46:31] it's not him that will it know he that
[46:34] run it but God who shows mercy he
[46:37] understands him and that God amen has
[46:39] placed him in this particular time and
[46:42] age to testify that Jesus Christ is the
[46:45] same yesterday today and forever he's
[46:49] not an organization he's not a
[46:51] denomination hallelujah but he is a
[46:53] manifested son and daughter of God you
[46:57] and I must understand Amen that if God
[47:01] be for us who can be against us
[47:04] hallelujah I must say that again we must

[47:14] evil
[47:15] so can i that dwelling place I'm just a
[47:19] fool to believe that no evil shall come
[47:22] nigh magged well in place is that right
[47:25] the Bible said that the angel of the
[47:27] Lord in kappa by those that fear him Oh
[47:30] glory to God hallelujah is that Alright
[47:33] that same Word of God said that there is
[47:36] a fire that encompassed me I've got a
[47:40] wall of fire about me

[48:15] high blood pressure I've seen God
[48:17] delivered from the by diabetes I've seen
[48:19] and do it and that same God lives today
[48:22] and I'm here to tell you the same God
[48:25] that lives today has given me the Holy
[48:28] Ghost and the Bible said after which the
[48:30] Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall
[48:32] receive power that power is Authority
[48:36] God has given us authority over the
[48:38] devil God listen let me say like this

[48:43] particular church but have been caught
[48:46] with Corona hallelujah and we prayed

[48:56] a witness that God can defeat Corona

[49:03] whatever you want to call it but there
[49:05] is no demon in hell that is able to
[49:07] overcome Jesus hallelujah
[49:11] because when God God's for your sins in
[49:14] my sins and when he wrote the decision
[49:17] and go with it to hell realize the day
[49:19] Corona was there hallelujah and my god
[49:23] car

[49:29] the devil is sending this way God is a
[49:31] vicar we are not to fear hallelujah we
[49:36] have the authority but we need to learn
[49:39] how to turn on faith and open up our
[49:41] mouth hallelujah the sword of God is in
[49:45] your mouth not just in your head the
[49:49] sword of God is in your mouth hallelujah
[49:52] is that right the Bible says you can say
[49:55] to a mountain be thou move and it shall
[50:00] be done
[50:00] I don't know about you but I'm not
[50:02] afraid of the darkness let me say like
[50:07] that again I'm not afraid of the
[50:10] darkness why because I know a man who
[50:13] could turn on the light hallelujah
[50:16] I know someone a man who could take the
[50:18] darkness and disperse it in a moment's
[50:21] time you see I'm not like Moses Moses
[50:25] forgot just in a moment time what God
[50:28] was doing and when the enemy came in
[50:31] under him like a flood y'all better hear
[50:34] me this morning because some of us ought
[50:36] to be a shame of ourselves hallelujah
[50:39] i'ma say it again some of us ought to be
[50:41] ashamed of ourselves some of us haven't
[50:43] even come to church in a long time since
[50:45] Coby came because you're afraid you
[50:47] ought to be ashamed of yourself and call
[50:49] yourself Christian oh god I hope I'm
[50:53] knocking on your door this morning
[50:55] hallelujah you ought to be ashamed of
[50:58] yourself God is God and how you'll never
[51:03] how will you ever know he's real if you
[51:06] don't see God work in your life do you
[51:09] know faith need the experience
[51:11] hallelujah somebody help me faith need
[51:14] the challenge hallelujah
[51:16] you'll never know what you got until
[51:18] your challenge David played his harp day
[51:21] by day but when the lion came he was
[51:25] challenged hallelujah
[51:28] David knew that himself he could not
[51:30] defeat the lion but he knew the God who
[51:33] could and the lion was delivered in his
[51:36] hands
[51:38] he continued to play and a bear came his
[51:42] way David a boy even knew he could not
[51:46] defeat the bear on your own you can't
[51:49] couldn't defeat Corona but we know the
[51:51] God who can hallelujah
[51:54] they said they're coming another way
[51:56] that's the way come because I've been
[51:59] told by the prophet of God that every
[52:01] wave I will crash I'll know by God's
[52:05] grace that I am born a victor I know by
[52:10] God's grace I've been born a conqueror
[52:12] even so that Paul said we're more than
[52:15] conquerors through Christ Jesus somebody
[52:18] help me here you see we're not afraid
[52:21] we're the Church of the Living God
[52:23] onward Christian soldiers marching as to
[52:26] war with the cross of Jesus going on
[52:28] before hallelujah I've got the cross of
[52:31] Jesus in the front of me I've got the
[52:34] cross of Jesus in back of me
[52:36] he's my buckler he's my sword he's my
[52:39] shield
[52:40] he's my helmet hallelujah he's my all
[52:42] and all hallelujah god shoot up stand up
[52:51] he wants us amen to be bold and brave
[52:54] hallelujah y'all hear me he wants us to
[52:58] be bold and brave I'm not saying I'm not
[53:01] fighting in my flesh people I'm fighting
[53:03] in my spirit and in my soul hallelujah I
[53:07] don't take vaccinations hallelujah
[53:11] they got a one coming and I before I
[53:14] knew all of these things God told me
[53:16] whatever you do don't take it don't take
[53:19] the fascination I don't know what it has
[53:22] all in it but that's what God told me
[53:24] before they even talked about a vasa
[53:26] nation before they even said anything
[53:28] about being the first wave or secondly
[53:30] God Himself spoke to me in my prayer and
[53:33] said this is the first wave and there's
[53:35] coming another hallelujah but there's
[53:38] some people that same God is my
[53:41] protection
[53:42] he's my sword he's my shield hallelujah
[53:47] somebody help me here but a lot of us
[53:50] amen we're afraid of things but Paul
[53:53] said I am persuaded neither death nor
[53:56] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[53:59] powers nor things present nor things to
[54:03] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[54:05] creature shall be able to separate us
[54:08] from the love of God which is in Christ
[54:09] Jesus I know that many of us are fearful
[54:14] otherwise God wouldn't be preaching this
[54:16] I can almost feel it coming my way you
[54:19] are insane brother Brooks I guess I am
[54:22] hallelujah but this is the way I preach
[54:24] at my church and by God's grace not one
[54:27] person in our church has ever had it
[54:29] that we know of you understand me
[54:33] we're moving to perfection now a lot of
[54:36] times people perfect people think that
[54:38] perfection a man is not doing anything
[54:40] wrong perfect perfection is when you
[54:43] willing to give God your perfect will he
[54:47] you make his will your perfect will you
[54:50] understand me
[54:51] Abraham was considered perfect because
[54:54] he was willing to give his perfect his
[54:57] will to God's perfect will that's what
[54:59] makes you perfect not your dues and your
[55:02] don'ts it's his will that you are
[55:06] interested in more than anything y'all
[55:08] hear what I'm saying
[55:09] let me hear let me say that again a lot
[55:12] of us think well if I just walk in a
[55:14] straight jacket
[55:15] I'm gonna be all right with God that's
[55:16] not it that's why Jesus said that in the
[55:20] garden of God sibling he said Lord not
[55:23] my will but thine be done
[55:25] what was it yield and your will to his
[55:28] will is what makes you perfect
[55:30] hallelujah God be helpless help me Lord
[55:34] God has always been supernatural might
[55:36] say that again I'm saying these things
[55:39] because you and I must understand we're
[55:42] rapturing material you must be tried you
[55:47] must be tested I remember the other day
[55:50] let me say it like that I had a
[55:53] situation that came upon me and
[55:58] I remember the scripture says perfect
[56:00] love casts out fear and I remember the
[56:04] fear coming upon me but all of a sudden
[56:07] it disappeared because I prayed I don't
[56:13] know whether I told that testimony or
[56:14] not but I was on the plane and the plane
[56:17] was losing pressure it was getting ready
[56:20] to crash the stewardess had flight
[56:23] attendants they were afraid and I said
[56:26] to the Lord Lord you didn't tell me I
[56:28] was going to die today but I wasn't you
[56:32] know for a moment I really I really I
[56:34] was so afraid I I couldn't even catch my
[56:36] breath and I heard something say perfect
[56:40] love casts out fear and all of a sudden
[56:44] fear left but the thing that I noticed
[56:48] was that I wasn't the one that cast it
[56:50] out it was perfect love it was God
[56:56] himself on the scene he got rid of the
[57:00] fear for me y'all hear what I'm saying
[57:02] it's just like the bees and in the bone
[57:06] it was God who got rid of the fear when
[57:09] God gets rid of fear faith and love
[57:12] steps here
[57:13] hallelujah you know what I'm saying Amen
[57:17] Daniel Amen didn't get rid of his fear
[57:19] it was God who got rid of Daniels fear
[57:23] Daniel would not have been able to face
[57:25] the lion Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[57:28] would not have been able to face the
[57:31] fiery furnace hallelujah y'all
[57:34] understand me even David would not have
[57:37] been able to face Goliath on his own but
[57:41] we have a God and this God is perfect
[57:44] love who is Jesus Christ it is God who
[57:47] came to his rescue that ride it was God
[57:50] who stepped into the fiery furnace it
[57:52] was God the envelop of God that we
[57:54] worship today he always comes on the
[57:57] scene hallelujah you don't have to worry
[58:00] about nothing telling somebody I said
[58:03] what's going to happen just build a
[58:06] place there and our homeless got saved
[58:08] and I was telling brother we don't know
[58:10] maybe we'll come to that
[58:12] for it's all over but I don't fear it
[58:15] why because I have a word that my god
[58:19] supplies all my knees God would supply
[58:22] all your knees y'all hear me he
[58:25] surprised the children of Israel water
[58:27] in the desert he supplied the children
[58:30] of Israel with bread and meat in the
[58:32] desert he's the same God hallelujah
[58:36] he's a pride a man Elijah with fish with
[58:39] bread meat and bread hallelujah and if
[58:41] God can do that then he can do it now
[58:44] somebody help me he's the same God that
[58:47] turned water into wine hallelujah he's
[58:51] the same God that walked on the waters
[58:53] hallelujah he's the same God that raises
[58:57] men and women from the dead he's a
[58:58] saying today hallelujah

[1:04:49] place of refuge and that was under the
[1:04:51] blood the people today has
[1:04:53] place of refuge and that refuge is in
[1:04:56] the name of Jesus Christ baptized in his
[1:05:00] name filled with His Holy Ghost
[1:05:03] hallelujah that is the only hiding place
[1:05:06] it's gonna catch the whole world and

[1:05:13] Ghost it's coming and it's going to
[1:05:16] knock on your door I pray that you would
[1:05:19] flee to safety find yourself in Jesus
[1:05:22] Christ and then God will fill you with
[1:05:24] this Holy Ghost and then you will no
[1:05:27] longer be a coward but you have the
[1:05:32] authority of God working in you you love
