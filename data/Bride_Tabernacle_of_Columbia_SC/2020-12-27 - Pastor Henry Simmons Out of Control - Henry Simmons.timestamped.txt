[26:05] second peter third chapter
[26:08] ii peter the third chapter
[26:14] as we dwell on just what is the future
[26:18] the future
[26:19] 2021 as we embark upon a new year
[26:26] the future
[26:30] here peter says in the
[26:34] second peter the third chapter this
[26:37] second epistle beloved are now writing
[26:39] to you
[26:41] in both which i stir up your pure mind
[26:44] by way of remembrance
[26:46] that you may be mindful of the words
[26:49] which
[26:50] were spoken before by the prophet holy
[26:52] prophet
[26:54] and of the commandments of us the
[26:57] apostle
[26:58] of the lord and savior
[27:01] knowing this first that there shall come
[27:04] in the last days scoffers walking after
[27:07] their own
[27:08] lust and saying where is the promise of
[27:11] his coming
[27:13] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[27:15] things continued
[27:17] as they were from the beginning of
[27:18] creation
[27:20] for this they are willingly ignorant of
[27:21] that by the word of god the heavens were
[27:24] of old
[27:25] and the earth standing out of the water
[27:27] and in the water
[27:28] whereby the world that then was
[27:32] being over flood with water perish
[27:35] but the heavens and the earth which are
[27:37] now by the same word are kept in store
[27:40] reserved into fire against the day of
[27:42] judgment and prediction of ungodly men
[27:46] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[27:48] thing that one day is what the lord is
[27:50] as a thousand years
[27:52] and a thousand years is one day the lord
[27:54] is not slight concerning his promises
[27:56] that some men do count slightly
[27:59] but is long suffering to us for not
[28:01] willing that any should perish but that
[28:02] all should come to repentance
[28:05] but the day of the lord will come as a
[28:07] thief in the night
[28:08] in which the heavens shall pass away
[28:11] with the great noise and the elements
[28:12] shall melt with the fervent heat
[28:14] the earth also in the works that are
[28:16] there in shall be burnt up
[28:19] sin then that all these things shall be
[28:21] dissolved what amount of person ought
[28:23] you to be in all holy conversation in
[28:26] godliness
[28:27] looking for and hasting until the coming
[28:29] of the day
[28:30] of god when the heavens being on fire
[28:33] shall be dissolved and the elements
[28:35] shall melt
[28:36] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[28:38] according to his promise look for a new
[28:40] heaven
[28:41] and a new earth when dwelleth
[28:43] righteousness
[28:44] wherefore my beloved sin that you look
[28:46] for such thing
[28:48] be diligent that ye may be found of him
[28:50] in peace
[28:51] without spot and blameless and account
[28:54] that the longsuffering of our lord
[28:56] is salvation even as our beloved brother
[29:00] paul
[29:00] also according to the wisdom given him
[29:03] has written unto you may god bless you
[29:07] with his word you may be seated
[29:08] again we thank the lord we thank god for
[29:10] our sister there we're glad to have you
[29:12] this morning and
[29:14] we just appreciate everyone again the
[29:17] pressure way
[29:19] god is good amen the future let's
[29:23] um have a you know just a preview of
[29:26] what
[29:27] we've been through in a little bit of uh
[29:30] 2020 as we embark upon
[29:34] 2021
[29:37] out of control we said things are out of
[29:40] control
[29:41] amen as we look
[29:45] at the fires the wildfires
[29:51] that have hit the that have hit america
[29:56] next oh okay
[30:00] the pandemic and what is its cause
[30:11] then we had the social injustice and
[30:15] all of that
[30:20] hurricanes so many it's never before
[30:33] well by the grace of god we had so many
[30:36] things that have
[30:37] transpired in 2020
[30:40] that things just spare it out of control
[30:44] so much now
[30:48] man is trying to recover from 2020.
[30:53] we're in the recovering phase
[30:56] but is there really a recovery
[31:02] when i said the future what's in store
[31:05] for 2021
[31:10] is it more of the same
[31:15] or is there recovery can
[31:18] president-elect biden in his cabinet
[31:22] that he's put together
[31:25] can they cause a recovery
[31:30] sin the pandemic and
[31:33] the wildfires and the hurricanes and all
[31:36] the disasters that have hit america not
[31:38] only in america but hit the whole world
[31:42] how do we recover from it
[31:46] so i thought about i
[31:49] said hopefully we won't be here
[31:53] to speak on the new years that's coming
[31:55] in
[31:58] how do we prepare ourselves for 2021
[32:04] how do we prepare ourselves for 2021
[32:15] [Music]
[32:18] how do we prepare ourselves for 2021
[32:22] it's a lot that is going on
[32:28] i thought it's fitting that
[32:32] ii peter third chapter he said this
[32:34] second episcopal love are not right unto
[32:36] you
[32:36] and by which i stir up your pure minds
[32:38] by way of remembrance the bible states
[32:42] that
[32:43] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[32:46] and worse
[32:50] we realize that the world is saying this
[32:52] global warming and
[32:54] different things my wife was just
[32:55] telling me they say
[32:58] we're in store for more pandemics
[33:01] we're in store for how can we control
[33:04] the global warming and all of these
[33:06] things
[33:07] that are happening that's causing all of
[33:09] these things to befall us
[33:13] and they said except we attack
[33:17] except we deal with
[33:20] the main issues of what's causing the
[33:23] effect
[33:24] now scientific world is looking at what
[33:27] what's causing all of this
[33:31] we know that man because of greed
[33:35] he'll contaminate the waters to try to
[33:38] pull the resources the oil and
[33:41] the gold the diamonds and everything out
[33:43] of the earth
[33:44] and you know what if we stop pulling
[33:47] the coal the different things out of the
[33:49] earth that it's going to weaken the
[33:51] earth
[33:55] we know if we start drilling the oil and
[33:57] stuff in the oceans and all
[33:59] that it's going to contaminate the ocean
[34:04] so everything is being and it's going so
[34:07] far now
[34:08] so i think the things are out of control
[34:15] when it comes down to the social life
[34:19] i believe the world is saying
[34:23] everything is goes everything goes
[34:27] they said black lives matter but they
[34:29] said all lives matter
[34:34] so we're not going to get into the
[34:36] political arena
[34:38] but we realize that everything is being
[34:40] dealt with
[34:44] and man is facing the fact that how do
[34:47] we
[34:48] get it in control seeing that everything
[34:51] is
[34:52] falling apart the world is falling apart
[34:55] how do we
[34:55] get it back together how can we recover
[34:59] [Music]
[35:01] or to help us get things back together
[35:11] but peter's saying here he says
[35:15] knowing this first
[35:19] that that should come in the last days
[35:22] scoffers walking after their own
[35:24] lust and saying where is the promise of
[35:27] his coming
[35:30] people in our age in this dispensation
[35:34] this period of time
[35:35] do not want to face the fact that the
[35:38] coming of the lord is drawing now the
[35:44] disciples they were more in contact they
[35:46] told jesus jesus
[35:49] when should these things be and what
[35:51] shall be the sign of that coming in the
[35:53] end of the world
[35:55] they wanted to know because they knew
[35:57] that it was going to come a time
[35:59] that the world would come to his end
[36:02] and i'm saying to you and i sir just the
[36:06] time
[36:06] of the end have we come as far as we can
[36:10] go
[36:15] this 2021 the end of the world
[36:22] brother and sister we need to recognize
[36:25] that
[36:27] what are you and i going to prepare
[36:29] ourselves for
[36:36] they're talking about a a another strand
[36:39] of
[36:40] this virus and
[36:44] so when they get through with this one
[36:46] will it be a next one
[36:48] and how do we deal with it
[36:54] would there be more hurricanes next year
[36:57] how can we deal with the brother sister

[38:34] prophet god says that the man
[38:37] called the flood on himself
[38:44] and if man calls the flood man can cause
[38:48] the battle i'm looking in the bombs and

[39:28] better every time they try to better
[39:30] themselves they make it worse
[39:36] they're not satisfied with the way god
[39:38] has made it we know that this
[39:43] god made a garden of eden and he saw
[39:46] that everything was wonderful lovely
[39:48] but the devil got in the midst of it
[39:54] and the devil since that time amen
[39:57] he's tried to make a better world to sin
[40:00] in
[40:05] a world that man could have pleasure
[40:08] and sin you're trying to make it
[40:11] comfortable
[40:12] to sin
[40:16] the laws are being passed to make it
[40:19] comfortable
[40:19] to do what god said not to do
[40:27] hey we got a right to sin we want to put
[40:30] it on the book
[40:31] that is all right to have pleasure in
[40:34] that which god
[40:35] said is abomination in his sight
[40:40] but man is making it so comfortable
[40:44] and think he's going to get away with it
[40:48] not knowing that the day of reckoning
[40:50] coming
[40:52] that judgment amen going to come one day
[40:55] and everyone no matter what you're doing
[40:58] you got to stand

[1:01:25] makes it holy now
[1:01:30] have holiness lost its meaning
[1:01:36] you don't have to say male nor female
[1:01:39] you can say
[1:01:46] others are what what's up
[1:01:49] they got a whole nother language out
[1:01:51] there you ain't got to be called
[1:01:54] male not female you can be called
[1:01:58] what is that word they
[1:02:05] see what i'm saying we've gone too far
[1:02:09] language has lost the language that's
[1:02:12] lost its meaning
[1:02:15] we've gone so far to we don't even know
[1:02:17] how what to say
[1:02:20] old preachers don't have an idea of what
[1:02:23] to say
[1:02:25] because you if you say this they said
[1:02:26] that's wrong you said that
[1:02:28] but you got to say what the bible says
[1:02:30] isn't that right
[1:02:32] you can't add to it you can't take away
[1:02:34] are y'all with me
[1:02:37] if you say what the word say then god
[1:02:39] will back you up
[1:02:42] you say well man say the devil will back
[1:02:45] you up
[1:02:49] who you want to back you up god or the
[1:02:51] devil
[1:02:53] are you with me
[1:02:58] it says unthankful and holy without
[1:03:00] natural affection
[1:03:03] i'm telling you you have to pray and see
[1:03:05] what's natural and what's unnatural
[1:03:08] see because the natural and unnatural to
[1:03:11] these young people
[1:03:12] almost lost the reality
[1:03:17] they think it's natural to walk down the
[1:03:21] street
[1:03:23] what used to be pantyhose
[1:03:27] underneath garment
[1:03:30] oh y'all whoop me ain't ashamed to walk
[1:03:34] down the street and forgot your dress
[1:03:39] oh you're with me don't say
[1:03:42] nothing about it because they didn't
[1:03:45] forget the dream
[1:03:51] that used to be the underneath clothes
[1:03:53] but now it's acceptable
[1:03:54] as being your odd appearance
[1:04:00] are you with me and they don't want the
[1:04:02] old preachers to say nothing about
[1:04:04] it because this
[1:04:08] is new things are changing but god's
[1:04:11] word don't
[1:04:12] change are you look man
[1:04:15] if the preachers were standing the
[1:04:17] pulpit and telling people the truth
[1:04:19] things would be better
[1:04:23] are you with me
[1:04:28] truth breakers false accusers
[1:04:31] incontinence
[1:04:32] fears despising of those that are what
[1:04:37] i'm gonna tell you something you got a
[1:04:38] lot of folks hate you
[1:04:40] because you try to do the right thing
[1:04:45] i'm gonna tell you the world will draw
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:48] the devil will pull at you here pressure
[1:04:50] you
[1:04:52] god said whosoever will let him come
[1:04:55] with love and kindness he'll draw us the
[1:04:58] world will put pressure on you if you're
[1:05:00] not doing what the world wants you to do
[1:05:03] he'll keep pressuring your oppression
[1:05:05] you're pulling on you
[1:05:07] but god said whosoever will let him come
[1:05:10] take up the water of life freely
[1:05:14] anytime you feel pressured into a thing
[1:05:17] stay away from it
[1:05:20] because if it's god it'll be a love
[1:05:23] affair you don't want to
[1:05:26] serve god because you're afraid of him
[1:05:29] you want to serve him because you love
[1:05:31] him
[1:05:33] are you with me so we want to love god
[1:05:37] more
[1:05:38] than more and more
[1:05:42] in 2021
[1:05:46] that we get ready to meet god as a world
[1:05:49] is preparing
[1:05:51] and trying to recover
[1:05:55] by increasing sin
[1:05:59] and doing more wickedness than they ever
[1:06:02] practice in
[1:06:03] history of the world
[1:06:07] as they're increasing their wickedness
[1:06:11] and try to recover the economy
[1:06:16] and try to recap the global warming and
[1:06:19] all of these things
[1:06:23] but they'll have no solution and no
[1:06:27] dealing with sin
[1:06:32] as i said if america would have did
[1:06:35] like joan nineman when jonah went to the
[1:06:38] netherlands then will repent
[1:06:40] if america would get on their knees in
[1:06:42] the white house and everywhere
[1:06:44] in america in the state house if they
[1:06:47] get on their knees and say we repent we
[1:06:49] are sinners lord
[1:06:50] we're going so far away from you god we
[1:06:52] want to bring
[1:06:53] think we can do that you think that we
[1:06:57] can do that
[1:06:58] no if the world itself could get on
[1:07:01] their knees is that god we repent we'll
[1:07:03] lord we've gone away from your word lord
[1:07:06] forgive us
