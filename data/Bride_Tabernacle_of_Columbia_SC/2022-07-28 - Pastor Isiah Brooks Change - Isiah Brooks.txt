when you leave here amen god has been so good to us he's been better to me than i've been to myself i've got so many friends here brother yvonne and the family from new jersey new york and our brother uh from brother from brother greely yes you know what that is the elders know praise the lord i can't name everybody but i thank god for all of you as we stand let's go right into the word of god i know it's hot but just just try to keep your flesh from lusting yes there was a time we did not have air conditioning there's a time the only heat we would have would be those pot belly stoves or those fireplaces sometimes the only warmth you can get would get would be those blankets that were made and they were so heavy you was afraid they were going to pin you down to the floor but listen people of god we've come a long way but the christian is not getting weaker he's getting stronger we're not victims we're victorious and i don't know about you but by the grace of god i see something that i know that i gotta have and that's more of him we're going to read the scripture according to second corinthians the third chapter the 18th verse [Music] i wasn't trying to put on a show i was trying to let off the pressure because you and i must understand that it's very difficult for a preacher when the audience is quiet and still unless he's teaching but when you're in a revival you come to hear the sound of a revival and the sound of a revival is a lot of noise praising god the deepest part of a revival is when god changes your heart and when he changes your heart you'll cry out something has to change second corinthians the third chapter beginning at the 18th verse but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord now i hope everybody understand that scripture change must come and none of us can change ourselves change comes by the holy spirit philippians please 2 5 and 6. philippians 2 5 and 6. it reads let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god let us pray our dear father god lord how we love you the fellowship that you and i are and that we are having with you are is growing in such a great way i thank you lord for this time and opportunity to know where you're standing and the place that you have promised to reside wherein that human beings become the tabernacle of god father you promise that you will never forsake us nor will you ever believe us and father we thank you lord for the grace and the mercy hallelujah that you've brought us through and given unto us through all these years wonderful wonderful praises have gone up before you we pray now lord god because we realize that without the breaking of the bread there is no service and father i can't break the bread you break the bread please sir give us all what we stand in need of in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated we are the a special people a chosen people and elected people and i think sometimes within ourselves we forget what we really mean to god we forget the sacrifice he made so that we could have the opportunity tonight to praise and to worship him we need to understand that the message or the word of god for this day did not come for us just to memorize it within our minds but the word came to bring change and that change is to move amen from that dark dimension or the third dimension into a heavenly place is that right the bible said we are now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and that's only when you've got the holy ghost hallelujah because you must realize amen that there is something that's moving amen and you and i must understand what's really happening god didn't come in a way to for us to repeat the past and if we repeat the past that means we not learned he did not come to bring us into an organization or denomination but the bible said he whom the son is set free is free indeed this message this word i mean has such a depth to it but you'll never understand it until you're born again because the carnal mind cannot understand the spiritual things of god i like to entitle if i was to have a message change change and i don't know about you but i'm tired of seeing satan get the best of god's people when we in this day supposed to have a power come on somebody it's true if we've got the holy ghost that the sa the early church had then the same thing the early church did we should be doing it but most of us are i have to say it the way you want me to say it selfish it's too much self and not enough god and you and i must understand in order to get god's attention you've got to die and rot a desperation must come into your soul hello you've got to be tired and sick and tired of the devil trotting on your territory somebody help me this life but the only way that's going to ever happen you've got to have a change of mind hello somebody we must understand that the devil he's a cruel adversary but he's a smart guy is that right the first thing he did when it came to eve was to change her mind because he knew if he could change her mind he would be able to change her character hello do you realize that the whole bible is a built about upon changing the nature of man back to the nature of god after the thaw god's sacrifice of the lamb and all through the bible was telling the story of how god one day would restore mankind from that fallen estate back to his proper position hallelujah law couldn't do it law was a prison house but it was a teacher as well because it showed us how sinful we were hallelujah just so that you know the nature of man has it's more corrupt now than it's ever been but the education of man is supposed to be on a superior level then if that be true there's something wrong because it seems like the more you're educated the more corrupt you become look at the world but i'm going to tell you something satan is a root it's a how can i say he's such a serpent he's moved slowly and he can move so slowly and so quietly you won't even know he's there until he's ready to strike hello somebody i'm talking to the young people as well because i'm going to say some things that i hope gets your attention what is the devil trying to do he's trying to change your mind against the word of god hallelujah you say well brothers that can't be true it is true is a time that even science was on our side but he has changed the mind of people so much until science is bowing down to psychology y'all know what i'm saying even see what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is if the devil can get you to change your mind about god's word just one place he's got you you say well what got your mind let me say it like this i went to a wall mart i don't say that now and i was having trouble with the register and the lady who was going to help me she said well she said she will come my supervisor she will come and she will help you and when she came she was not a sheep don't get quiet she was a he but the devil inside in the way of psychology superseded biology and superseded science to this young lady was calling that which was not a chi a she so what are you saying brother brooks you're going to have to stand this is where persecution will come because right now the world is so bad and so blind amen they don't know the how to distinguish between male and female i'm not coming against anybody i don't care what you're into god is still able to deliver hallelujah and that's what we're here for to show this satan eden that god is still god and that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and under this pressure oh you may not be feeling it yet but he's moving and he's slowly moving in a way to the world can't even see what's happening but the pride of jesus christ we can see hallelujah is that right we can see what satan is doing and what is he doing you talking about mass destruction the spirit of mass destruction is moving among the people hallelujah but it has to be because that's the day we're living in hallelujah see if we weren't living in this day of sodom and gomorrah and noah's day there would never be a bride ready oh y'all getting quiet but i'm really talking to all of us because i'm going to tell you something you're going to have to decide in this generation whose side you're on i have a granddaughter who stood up for righteousness in school and she was circled and they were trying to make her recant about being a christian this is in high school she reported it to the teachers and the counselors and they did nothing we're not a people that's going to compromise oh come on y'all getting quiet i don't care what you used to be i don't care what you are now i'm saying we have a solution and the solution is the word of god we're not going to give you so sociology or psychology hallelujah wait a minute let me say it like this we all say we're the bride we're the bride and someone said we've been married we're the wife but i'ma ask you a question where is your husband where is your husband the early church was able to prove she was a bride of christ because she produced her husband hallelujah amen peter and james and dad at the gator beautiful silver and gold have i none but such as i have see my husband i give this to you and you and i must come i'm not even on my notes but you and i must understand that we're living in a time where we're going to step from one dimension into another hallelujah and the only way this is going to happen you must be holy oh come on somebody let me tell you like this we have fallen in love with a system hello most of these children all they know is systematic worship they know nothing about the holy ghost i wonder how many message people died loving the system thinking it was christ hallelujah if god told nicodemus you must be born again he's never backed up off the word you've got to have the holy ghost hallelujah i'm not talking about just a shouting and speaking in tongues i'm talking about a life i'm talking about bringing the dynamics and mechanics together so that people can see jesus christ it's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah it's a system and what you do not see it's the whole time you thinking you're okay satan is altering your mind those of you who look at tick tock he's altering your mind many who look at face i don't know nothing about this stuff but i'm saying those things are directed by the prince of the air hallelujah oh it's the truth you say heap but he slowly does it he slowly does it and what we fail to see is that he's changing you once he changes your mind he changes your character for thousands of years god has been trying to change the character of the people hallelujah we tried with the law touch not taste not handle not it doesn't work because that will not change you you know what changes men and women repentance are crying out to the living god lord i'm wrong and you're right this is just a foundation i hope let's move on because people don't believe that we must produce jesus yeah you got to produce jesus the jesus of this day the word that's been opened the almighty god we are supposed to be the messiahs y'all hear what i'm saying and i'ma tell you this you can work with all your might it'll never happen until you and i surrender hey surrender to what the word of god when we surrender god will then come along and bless us hallelujah but we're so busy i hope this is okay brother i just got to preach it anyhow because i i see things that i don't like it's so systematic to people don't even know how to come to church on time even in the system they still fail because that's law but when the holy ghost is in you you can't hardly wait till the doors are open y'all see the difference the difference is the holy ghost moves and when he moves you move hallelujah and that's what god is looking for he's looking for people who knows how to move when he moves change we would never have to worry about the way people dress if they stayed in the word and if they had the holy ghost hello somebody but we preach to those who don't have it they think they got it but when god is in you he checks you out every morning every day all day hallelujah let me get back to them the bible said be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind huh that this that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god what the perfect will of god is for your mind to be renewed and your mind can only be renewed uh by the word of god the holy spirit comes to renew you change you from the inside out oh help us lord how many y'all want to change come on don't be ashamed let me tell you something that in itself shows that something's wrong when you you don't want to change then what has happened who has bewitched you what serpent have you been listening to because you must realize without being changed you'll never make the rapture because this is what the message has come from come forth to change us from glory to glory to glory hallelujah that means the power of god's supposed to be increasing and not decreasing hallelujah in another revised age it says be not conformed to this age and you and i must understand to be transformed it means to be changed into something different a different thing but to be deformed it means to distort the shape or form of or make mishap misshapen misshapen in other words amen when you go through all these and you say we're not doing it but let me let me cause i'm finna get i'm gonna move from this place but i've gotta i've gotta say this by the grace of god that we gotta be careful at the things we read the things we look at the inspirations right and you've heard me say this before and i'm not making a doctrine out of it but i'll say it like this i never understood why holiness women would go into victoria's secret it's a spirit it's a spirit and you wonder why lust is on your mind oh see jesus if we're going to have a revival we must get the trash out of our lives that's what it's all about getting the trash out of our lives hallelujah oh we can shout and still be trashy we can dance and still be trashy we can speak in tongues and still be trashy but when the holy ghost get ahold of you he's going to cleanse you from the inside out and you won't even want nothing to do with trash oh come on somebody y'all know it's the truth you got to know that you've got to be changed the bible says no unclean thing will enter in the bible said god said according to malachi 3 i am the lord and i change not the saddest part about everything is that people seem like they're not thirsting for more god i've been a christian a long time but i want more of him i see things that i don't like about me that needs to be changed and i don't know about you by the grace of god young people this is just a foundation i hope whoever comes after me do a better job than i'm doing because i'm trying to let god have his way what you're going to do when you're confronted with the issues of this life and your bossman says except you do this or except you do that you don't have a job where will you stand hallelujah oh nobody's looking nobody know what the boss has said to you but he does you understand me i'm not talking about these mean arrogant christians that so self-righteous till they treat people that are different with the evil spirit that's not what i'm talking about you got to love the unlovable you got to love these people you don't know who they are y'all understand me paul said in corinthians and such were some of you i hope this is okay because you know what i'm coming to your house sometimes y'all have babysitters you better know your babysitter is full of the holy ghost you gonna trust your children with somebody who says they're in the message come on somebody you better make sure your babysitter is converted and that you've done a thorough background check a lot of these children are getting defiled oh come on by somebody you brought in the house huh it's nothing but the truth let me tell you something a girl does not go wild just to go wild somebody has touched her a boy doesn't go wild just to go wild somebody has touched him oh y'all looking at me like i'm crazy see a drastic change of nature shows that there's something that caused the drastic change i hope this is okay i got to tell her like he wants me to tell it see but the only thing that's going to help you in your house is that your nature be restored hello somebody we've got to have a restored nature not some man's nature but the nature of god hallelujah trying to act like malachi 4 ain't going to restore your nature having belt buckles and cowboy boots and all that kind of stuff that's not going to restore your nature the only thing that you're going to destroy your nature is that you get down to business with god there's only one real place of worship true place and that's under the blood of jesus christ that's in the heart i guess you say brother brooks preaching different this time i believe i'm more serious this time listen we come having our tent meetings and we come back every year and we find out there's harley nobody's been changed these meetings come to change you bless the servant of god and all of those who are behind him because we come to change not just to sing songs and act like hollywood i'm not saying it y'all know i get i get into myself sometime and maybe i get beside myself but the point is all glory be to god and you and i must come to if we're going to be the true church we've got to act like it we got to be it not by words only by power and demonstration oh i don't even know how to scream it we're living in the last days how many of y'all really believe that the rapture is on i didn't say the rapture is going to happen i said it's on and people are being changed right now we don't know the ultimate but one thing i know we're changing from glory to glory to glory into his image hallelujah you say i can't be sanctified where there was a age luther wesley pentecost they all met their criterias justification those who truly believed in justification and they lived it sanctification they lived it why by the power of the holy ghost those old pentecostals who really thought the gifts or restoration of the gift was it they still lived it hallelujah and if we be seed we must live it i don't mean oh i'm the bride i'm seed i get sick of that there's got to be power and demonstration and i believe that this is the season but we need somebody that's got a vision somebody who's not afraid hallelujah and say that the mighty angel has come down somebody who's going to say that he's not standing out on the outdoor of this church but he's on the inside hallelujah hallelujah i've seen miracles after miracles many of us have but that was yesterday and he claimed i'm the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah what i'm trying to do i'm trying and hoping that god will bless us tonight to build a platform of faith so that the next brother comes he'll take us higher and the next brother come and take us higher hallelujah that nobody would have to have hands laid on them but the power of god will come down and change you hallelujah i don't know about you i'm expecting i'm expecting i'm looking for something and he promised me whatever i ask and believe that i shall receive it it's mine and that's all god is asking he's asking you to believe it he's asking you to believe it so much so that you live it huh oh god help us here aren't you tired of religion come on somebody i'm tired of religion and you know what people the young people they need more than religion religion ain't going to hold them because religion ain't holding you we got so many people that can quote this and quote that and quote this and mean his serpents we need some love i know love is corrective but i need some love oh come on somebody when i fall i need somebody to pick me up not talk about me not scorn me oh come on somebody y'all getting quiet now oh jesus i'm coming to new testament church let me say it like this where in the bible the new testament church ever and i'm not scaring anybody because i go to doctors too but the new testament church didn't have to do that because they had the power of god with them the healer was with them oh come on somebody doctors have their place but i'm looking for the great doctor i'm looking for jesus christ that can turn the tides for every one of us he's the same god he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind is that right he made the lame walk he made the dumb talk he changed leprosy into cleanliness he's the same god he said he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and if you believe that he will answer while the devil is telling you god ain't the same while the devil is telling you god is weak he ain't gonna do that for me why wouldn't he not one of us in here is righteous of ourselves every bit of righteousness that we do have comes from god alone right you know i just want to if there'll be a sinner in here somebody who really needs god let me tell you something jesus christ is real he can change you if you let him he's willing to change you he's willing to give you the holy ghost but some of us you know what the problem is we still got that how can i say it denomination or organizational mentality we are we all thinking the way they taught us what the holy ghost was how can they teach you what the holy ghost was they told you about the gifts they told you about the anointings they did teach you something hallelujah but what about going behind the veil what about going to that place that that that when it when you get there it literally changes your whole makeup i'm not saying that wasn't good but we got to go beyond hallelujah so what are you saying we said malachi 4. vindicated god vindicated him what about you bry where's your vindication we're slugging along when this is the time to be on fire anybody want a revival y'all understand what i'm saying i'm trying to say we want god to pour down his spirit we know he's here but we want him to fill us with his spirit hallelujah feel us lord feel us lord hallelujah hallelujah we come we come because we need more of him hallelujah it's not about religion it's about him it's about christ and you the hope of glory hallelujah i am determined i'm determined if i lose all my friends i'm determined if i lose all my family i'm determined when i hear the message and the word of god preached to me i identify with it that's me when i hear the word perfection i identify with it that's me you know what brother i know what you used to be you're right it was what i used to be but what i am now he made me this hallelujah oh come on somebody some people you'll never get listen we come to a place and i believe god ordained this moment he ordained you to be bride he'll y'all understand me he put you in that position so that he can manifest himself for this day now i'm i'm just talking on a low level but my point is this if god has had favor with you call you to this message and you handle it like it's nothing what do you think your judgment will be let me ask you a question when's the last time you witnessed to somebody about jesus christ i'm trying to tell you something when the last you literally prayed an hour oh i didn't keep time i just went on and on and on when the last time you had that oh come on somehow you don't have to raise your hand but i'm trying to tell you there's a condition and the serpent is behind it because he knows if you lukewarm god will spew you god is looking for somebody that's on fire help us lord to get on fire for jesus christ religion is going to do it i don't care what church you belong to what brand of church the church can't save you only jesus christ saves hallelujah come on somebody i was in a meeting just the other day and i think i heard the name of jesus maybe five times in three four nights and this is the message of the hour they say you understand me how can you talk about jesus and don't mention his name the devil don't care if you say god he don't care if you mentioned william branham or elijah or moses or noah or james or john but the name oh i'm in trouble now i don't care i told god i want me some scars when it comes amen to jesus christ he's the only lord he's the only savior nobody else can save you hallelujah and you and i must understand your religion can't do it millions have had religion it didn't make it i i'm not gonna be too much longer i'm way off my notes process of life one thing i know about life in itself if you're the seed all you need is some rain and sunshine a true seed of god knows how to penetrate itself through concrete nothing will hold a true seed of god back once the light strikes it a true seat of god in this moment in time in this hour is thinking about nothing else but jesus christ and what he's getting ready to do with us i don't even want to put it in the future because i'm looking at things right now i was over there to my sister-in-house law house today and i hope this is okay i've got to preach it she was in a house fire i had the privilege of baptizing not me personally but was there when they got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ she had cancer she's just a little notch away from being cancer free but she was telling me some testimonies how she was in a house fire they were in the house didn't even know the house was on fire and one of the sisters one of the friends that would have opened the door and the power of the fire was so powerful it knocked him against the wall the whole house was on fire started in the attic there was no way of escape and she heard a voice say peace something like that she said all of a sudden a hole came through the fire she got the picture of it i saw it a whole and she said she told everybody come on follow me and they ran through the fire everybody that followed her never had a burn hallelujah she was telling me how that she my brother-in-law they were driving on a highway and it started raining and and the car hydroplaned she said she was up in the air they were the car was up in the air and she could see a distance all of a sudden she felt something just reach his hand out and drop the car lightly i can't tell her like she telling but i was having a jubilee hallelujah because what it is amen she don't even have the full understanding like we do but one thing she knows is that jesus christ is lord and that he's god hallelujah yes sir i was telling her how god healed me from cancer i said he gave me a faith i can't explain she said that's right she said when that faith comes you can't explain it she said it's so supernatural you know it hallelujah listen she said everything the doctor told me that was gonna happen to me never did my hair never came out i didn't lose weight in my face she gained weight and the doctor said what is this hallelujah you know what it is god and she had fought stage four cancer and god healed up with the help of the doctors but that's all right god used doctors too i thank god for them hallelujah but what's going to happen when the squeeze comes and you don't have a doctor see if you say you don't have a doctor i'm saying you need to get down on your knees because we got a doctor amen there is one who can heal you in spite of everybody else hallelujah i like to say it like my mother-in-law said when they said you was gonna die she said did jesus tell you that if jesus didn't tell you i don't want to hear it you understand me i don't know why we come through the things we come through but one thing for sure at the end there's a rainbow and there's a closer walk with god hallelujah that he gives us i don't care what i got to go through that after the storm is over i can say god brought me through hallelujah i want to be a testimony i want to be able to tell people that jesus christ is the same yesterday and day forever hallelujah i am not a victim i'm victorious hallelujah i refuse to let the devil make me think i am a victim hallelujah i feel so sorry for some of these folks you don't want jesus but let me tell you something there's nothing on earth that can satisfy you like jesus christ can hallelujah you might have a beautiful boyfriend but your boyfriend can't satisfy you like jesus can you might have a girlfriend but your girlfriend can't do you like jesus hallelujah you have a mother and a father a sister and a brother but they can't do you like jesus there's nobody that can do you like jesus hallelujah he's a friend above all friends hallelujah he's a comforter somebody know what i'm talking about when your friends are not there he comes on the scene hallelujah he's there for you we need to be there for him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah paul said it i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god unto salvation we need to see we need to show these people that when i came when i came to jesus he made a change oh what a change hallelujah he made a change maybe some of y'all don't know where i come from but i'ma tell you for some of you who might think you know i still made a change on your think so i'm not talking about a jesus that fails i'm talking about a jesus that's a lie huh my god is not dead hallelujah but what's happened to me i have a change in mind i'm determined whatever it takes whatever it takes i don't know what he wants to do with me but i really want to be in that place when he wants to use me he can use me i hate seeing what we call the bride such a dead thing most of us don't even have to joy the word no more is that right we don't listen to tapes we don't read books we don't read our bibles we don't pray but we're bright may god grant us repentance tonight help us lord we need your help lord i'm not fussy understand my love is being thrown out there to you because i know what i've gone through i know how i have been such a part of a system and i'm like wait a minute there's got to be more to god than this all of the politics and everything that goes with it it's got to be what did we do many of the tribes those two tribes that went back over it's the same thing that a lot of people in this message have done they went back over when we were put in a land to conquer it okay i'm gonna say this and i'm gonna shut down we don't even know why god destroyed the world because of violence have you seen the violence lately because of perversion let me tell you something when the children of israel came into canaan canaan had riches grapes and houses and lands and cows and whatever more they had but what thing they did not have was laws that can bring them under conviction to their loose living hello oh come on somebody can you see today can you see today what the laws are doing to the people bringing them into a place where they are loose in their living and when you're loosed in your living you get diseases even the children oh come on somebody so he said kill it all destroy it all that was god's immune system that was god working on the children of israel to keep them from that nasty stuff you said brothers you shouldn't talk like that i'm trying to tell you something we're right on the verge of god dropping a bomb you and i have never seen the world like this before and you and i cannot sympathize we must be an example of what god want a true son and daughter of god and the only way we can establish that is that we have the nature of god in us y'all don't know you're sending your children to school and some of us don't have a choice but the whole time they're working on perverting your kids changing their minds and if you don't have bible study with them and show them what the word of god says you're definitely going to lose them you say well how you know that because without the nature of god in them they avoid and all they have is the nature of this world and when that thing is pulled on by the nature of this world they will fall to it help us lord proverbs 13 15. i did not try to be rushed rough i had no idea i was going to be preaching like this but i will say this by the grace of god i know that i'm under the inspiration of the holy spirit and i will say this by the grace of god it's up to you god has been so good to us you know america we should be the greatest greatest worshipers in the world some of us haven't gone over to these foreign countries just to see how they live and what they don't have but we've got more than enough right we'll go to a hamburger shop and order two burgers instead of one we got so good in our day we get it in large extra large it's the truth that's the goodness of god it is so strange but it's okay because i really know where i stand and i'm gonna say by the grace of god by his grace i know he's in the inside this way i worship that's why you see when he's here i stay connected but when he's up there that's where you think he is he's everywhere but in this day he's supposed to be in you right in that day you know i'm in the father of the fathers in me and i am in you so when he's in you you don't you don't carry on like he's up there you become one with him there's a union here invisible union there's a union there's a place you can talk to him without even uttering words out of your mouth i've seen god do things without me opening my mouth just talking to him he's real i'm closing if we don't do nothing say lord i may not have gotten a jest of what brother brooks is saying but one thing i know is that i need to be changed don't sit here fooling yourself and oh grace going to cover everything to him that knoweth to do good and do it that not it's still sin and you and i we owe god our all in all three months ago i have been under so much weight and troubles and for a long period of time the young minister in my life in my church says brother books my daddy told me that all you all preachers are responsible for is preaching the word he can't save nobody you know i've i've known that but that day it became a revelation i felt like the man in pilgrim's progress all my burdens dropped right now i'm the happiest and most freest man i've ever been even since coming to into this message because you see so much i was i was i was in the apostolic church i had no control i i know spirits i see it everywhere you look and you say well why is it the way it is because many of us have done the same thing we don't call it an organization we don't call it a denomination but we we've done the same thing one brother said something to me the other day when i was down in iowa city i said ah as i got eight children and they all mine they act differently but they all mine and i said till we start loving each other even in the differences there's only one saving blood the bible said by one spirit are you baptized into one body one some things you can't even you have to be cautious about what you say i don't believe in bringing new doctrines there's only one doctrine and that's jesus christ if that makes sense but i'mma say this to you and to the young people don't ever be afraid to talk to your mom and your daddy i don't care what goes on in the family around the family you need to talk what makes people go wild doesn't necessarily mean it has to be something sexual but whatever it is or whatever it would be alters their mind and brings them to a place where you know they they take on a spirit i know what i'm talking about my own children i know what i'm talking about and there were so many things i found out after that things that you cannot undo if we don't teach them this word if we don't teach them you know what god is expecting out of them and if we don't have how can i say a place in their heart where they can feel comfortable talking with us you're going to lose them we're the bride of christ the mighty counselor is inside of us sometimes wisdoms words of wisdom come to my mouth i don't even know where they're coming from other than i have to say thank you jesus and those of us god still receives confessions he still receives a broken heart when the last you've seen that huh when the last have you seen a broken heart somebody really weeping and crying and repenting unto the lord when the last year something's wrong it ain't the word and the closer we get to his coming to the changing of the body to meeting him in this way that he's ordained us to meet him it seemed like the father people get away i don't know but i sigh and cry because of what i'm seeing and i've been really crying out to the lord not just for my house but for everybody's house this is a time that god is going to show who's who and i trust and pray that you're one of them in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning
