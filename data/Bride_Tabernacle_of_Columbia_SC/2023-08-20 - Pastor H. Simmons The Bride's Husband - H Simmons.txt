love you Lord Lord we need Revelation more than anything we need you to reveal yourself to us we need you now help us now Jesus touch every heart in Jesus name amen we thank God the Book of Revelations 19 and 7. Revelation 19 and 7. we're living in a glorious hour but we're living in the most corrupt time in history because we are closing in on the end of the world and we know the Bible said as it was in the days of no and as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed so we're in the owl that we're going to see gross Darkness cover the Earth amen so we've seen what is taking place in our communities in our neighborhood all over the land we're in prayer for those in Hawaii amen and those over the land we're just praying that God would be merciful and wrath remember Mercy God have mercy God have mercy Revelation 19 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made what herself ready to be seated for now God bless the reading this word his wife has made her separated and to her was granted day for in her into her was granted that she should be arraigned and find the linen clean and white for the fine lineness the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me writing blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the Lamb and he said unto me these are the true Sands of God and I failed at defeat to worship Him and he said unto me see thou doeth not for I am what that fellow servant and of thy brethren so sometimes we think it's a supernatural I mean a spiritual Angel but he says I'm on your brethren are you with me that have the testimony of Jesus worship of who worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of what uh prophecy and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that setteth upon him was called what faithful and what faithful and true and in it in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vexed dip in blood how many know who that is and his name was called the what the word of God how many you know who that is can you identify who that is Hallelujah I believe that's Jesus amen can you see Jesus in his word it's Jesus amen look what happened and his arm is which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and all of his mom goes a sharp sword at that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a what and thread The Wine Press of the pureness of the Wrath of the almighty God are you with me things are happening in now but people's eyes are closed to what's going on he said and he said uh and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written what they read what and what king of kings and Lord of lords are you with me see one time it was one time in history that Jesus came on the scene and they was expecting him to rule with a wrought iron they was expecting him to be the king the Messiah but he came amen humbly as the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world yet the expectation was up so high that it was looking for him to amen take over amen and Rule with the wrong hands instead of coming in church man he came in Mercy are you with me amen the world Amen at this time amen is coming to his end the world is getting ready for the great battle Obama look at him if we'd have read on down you would have seen the world is getting ready for the battle though not dog and Magog and Russia and all of those are getting ready for the great battle of Armageddon United States might think they're ready for the battle but it won't be long but before that battle takes place something got to happen you must recognize Who You Are I believe God has chosen himself a word bride this morning I'm talking about the bride husband I'm not so much as putting emphasis on the husband as I'm putting emphasis on the white this morning the bride the Lamb's wife are you with me so if we look at Revelation 21 and 9 I started going and I said if I was a teacher I would be gone for hours sometimes teachers got a way of showing their intellect preachers try to you know preach that people might come convicted God is good to us the word must be a precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little amen what you what we want you to have is an understanding of Who You Are amen he said in all I get and get understanding amen he said my people are destroyed because of lack of knowledge but if you know who you are amen you can even become what God's how God saw you before the world began he saw you and he plays your name in the last book of life before the foundation of the world are you up there but you must amen get a revelation or who you are or the devil make you anything but once you have a revelation in it's been revealed to you who you are amen the devil can't touch you because you have a revelation in that revelational uh even the gates of hell should not Prevail against you you notice I didn't say it against hell should not Prevail against the church but I'm against you amen because you know who the church is amen Revelation 21 and 9 it says that that came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seventh last plagues and talk with me saying come here I will show what I'll show Thee the bride the what the Lamb's wife and see I said the bride husband oftentimes we talk about the bride husband the bride Adam's bride was the mystery of Adam being revealed are you with me because Adam broad was hid in Adam are y'all with me Eve was hid and Adam and Eve was a mystery of Adam being revealed that makes sense because she was here amen they can see he because she was still in Adam are you with me but when he was taken out of Adam she was still part of Adam are you with me but she came forward to do something amen the Bible said be fruitful and what so she was to reproduce Adam are you up man not something else amen praise God so by the grace of God we want you to know your purpose I show you the bride the Lamb's wife she had to be fruitful and to multiply amen now notice Corinthians tell us that uh Jesus is the last what Adam isn't that right the bright husband maybe I'm gonna skip over some things I go right to um Second Corinthians second Corinthians 11 God is good amen he said what to God that get back with me a little while in my Folly and indeed bear with me before I've espoused you to what I'm jealous over you regardless jealous for I've inspired you to what one husband are you up man see if you don't know who your husband is are you a man yo the praise God as much as the husband must know by revelation it must be revealed to him who his wife is and I know the husband don't make no mistakes amen for who he knows them that are his are you a man but the wife also must have a revelation of who her husband is you must not be confused are you with me because without a revelation or who you're not you're married the wrong person are you with me you're married off of other things without revelation you're married off of fleshly sensation and not revelation you need to have a revelation of who your husband is the bride husband without that revelation praise God you're going to make a shipwreck of your life a lot of people are are looking to the church and they're looking to men and they'll look at the other things instead of getting a revelation or who your husband is people mixed up did they that's why we're having so much so many problems he said I'll expose you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin in the Christ but I fear at least by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his utility he got Eve to adopt the word are you with me you must know praise God who your husband is and you need to be Sergeant unto him are you with me because he loves you enough to die for you are you with me I'm taking my time because I know I'm just going to start this I want to just make it a series and just go but I'm finding out people over so confused people are just so confused they go to church but they're completely confused they're looking for something outwardly instead of looking for to know God themselves personally and that the spirit of God reveals in it himself to you as an individual to have that personal relationship with God almighty I'm too you know I say preachers preaching but I the Bible said if God call you to preachers that preach the word amen they can preach all kind of things and what somebody said doesn't say that but he said preach the word are you up there the Holy Ghost Field preacher Don't Preach the word you're not going to be confused you're gonna preach the word he gonna stay in the book are you with me I was telling some preachers I said if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're going to preach man you know preach what other folks say but if you got the Holy Ghost you're gonna preach the word people that without the Holy Ghost they're gonna follow some other kind of spirit they're gonna follow men they're gonna follow the church my people with the Holy Ghost s they know who the husband is God they know that amen Eve because she died in one word we know that if we're going to live we're gonna not by bread alone but by what every word that perceived from the mouth of God is every word of God God I I I I I'm married to the word are you up there I got to hold to this book for Christ is the mystery of God revealed are you up there are you with me so amen you are the mystery of Christ revealed are you with me do you know who you are praise God you are the way God praise God not something that Pope
