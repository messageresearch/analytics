kindness towards us father for we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen we want to look tonight by the grace of God at The Book of Mark amen Mark 8 by the grace of God very famili scripture 8 and 34 we want to talk about paying the price tonight amen paying the price Mark 8:34 you got it say amen and it reads and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me and for for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man he gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for a soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and and of my words in the this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels May God had the blessed to reading of his word you may be seated he said whosoever be ashamed of him he going to be ashamed of you right he said and he said in back then in this adulterous and and evil you call it adulterous and sinful generation I can say we even the more tonight amen and God don't want you to be ashamed of him you know there's a lot of lot of different religions out there and the people ain't ashamed of their God neither but you find sometimes today that to to uhuh cuz you know everybody got got claims on Christianity but we know that a lot of times you can't tell them uh different from the world but to live a real Christian life amen to live a real Christian Life a lot of seems that the people sometimes are are ashamed of living that life right but he says in that in those in the scriptures he says if you be ashamed of me then I'm going to be ashamed of you so when I come he says when he comeing in glory So I says you know don't be ashamed of God tonight amen you know we want to talk about pray paying the price I says you know uh uh here I like how Jesus says if any man come after me let him first deny himself right take up his cross and follow me and I believe over in Luke 9 it says follow uh follow take up your cross daily and follow him so this isn't just uh something we just uh uh get ourselves geared up for when we come to church or you know just on Sunday we're going to be on our best behavior then but it's a it's a daily Affair it's a it's a daily walk it's a you know um a hourly I would say it like an hourly walk you know with with God every second every moment you walking with God because you want to be pleasing in his sight I don't know about you but I was praying I says Lord you know sometimes you look at yourself and you look at what some of the price that was paid throughout all of of world history that the people had to pay the price they had to pay for the gospel's sake and you look at yourself sometimes and you you say Lord what am I doing or what have I done to even be considered you know uh uh in the ranks of being called a son or a daughter of God a Son of God you know the Bible says in in in uh Second Timothy uh 2 or 3 3:12 I believe it is he says all that live Godly shall suffer persecution all that live Godly you know it's not you know it's something about it if the devil ain't after you then it's something wrong amen y'all believe that tonight but you on a daily battle you but you know one thing even though the devil's after you God's got it all in control anyway you know we put it all in the Master's hands but I say it's Lord paying the price I look at you know you look at your life sometimes and you say you know the Bible talked about the evil men they was going to wax worse and worse right being they was going to not only deceive but they would be being deceived because so you know that as the time gets closer uh to the end there's a separation between good and evil there's a separation between light and dark separation between those who are and those who are who are professing uh uh the cause you know but when the squeeze come the squeeze going going we're going to find out then what what a person is really made up of then so now we look at ourselves now I was thinking that I've been looking at a lot of the uh stuff on the reformation and and and the Dark Ages and how you know a lot of a lot of people was professing and they were going and following wickcliff and hust and all those but when it came down to being burnt at the state you know a lot of them recanted a lot of people when it came down to the to the fire in the wood having to go up there and and die they they turned back and they recanted everything because they weren willing to die because the persecution uh uh you know they were willing to follow follow when but when it came down to giving their life so a lot of them turned around but I says that what it is you got to be so sold out to God that no matter what comes your way you willing to give it all come on it it shouldn't be a doubt in your mind whether you ready to go all the way or not you know you got to consider consider your walk you know paying the price I said it's what it is everybody everybody today wants stuff for free that's the way of of the of the world ain't it everybody wants stuff for free but the thing the the the the the most precious thing that they can receive without money without price they don't want that come on they think that it just sounds too too uh uh glorious too unbelievable or Paradox come on it's free salvation is free but the people still in their minds sometimes think that they can work to earn or achieve it come on but the to believe now salvation is free but there's still a price you got to pay come on with the life but they they they want everybody want stuff for free I say a lot of of times we work we work hard and we'll spend our hard work money on things that don't make don't make no sense don't mean a thing this guy was at work telling me about this new thing they got out called uh I think it's nfts or something like that you can buy it like you buy stocks or something he says but whatever you do don't get caught up in that he says cuz what people are do he picked up a poll he said like this poll people will put it online and say it's worth 500 $ or I'm selling it for $500 it's just an aluminum pole broke off from a broom handle but he says you know somebody out of all the people looking at it cuz they'll say somebody out of all the people looking at it will spend $500 on it and he says now it wasn't worth nothing but now it's worth $500 to you because you spent $500 on it but the people spend they'll run work spend their hard work money on stuff that don't make no sense at all come on now it's worth something to you because you spent your hard work money on it but Salvation is free so we was talking you know I thought about how in the in the in the old days and how the church world was selling Indulgence and all these things people spending the work their hard work money to buy things to think that this way I can buy my way into heaven or this way I can work my way out of purgatory and all these things that didn't make no sense but God had somebody that was faithful somebody that that was seeking God and wanted to uh uh really uh give the people take the lies away from the people and give the people the truth that you can't buy your way into heaven come on you were born in the price was too high from the day you were born Hallelujah but it was one that was willing to pay that price come on and it was a high price price but he was willing to pay it and he says whosoever will let him come freely come on a lot of times the devil hold people back because they look at themselves and who they are and what they done and all this and God don't want me but don't you know God paid the price for you come on you got to get that out of your mind come on and realize that Calvary Jesus Paid the price for you and he said whosoever will let him come come on but you got to be willing I was I was sharing with the other day with my wife and those I think I was talking about wife knows I says you know the thing about it is you know when a person loves God they'll do anything God asked them to do if they genuinely love him a lot of people claim they have they love God and they want God they love him but the thing is you don't do things out of restraint because you have to or because you're bound but it comes freely because the love that you got for God you do because you love God we're here tonight we're here tonight in service because we love God that's why I'm here hallelujah because I love God somebody says why you going to church on a Friday night I told him I said it's better to be there than in the club but I said the thing about it is I love God if church was on a Thursday I'd be there on a Thursday if church was on a Wednesday I'd be on a Wednesday or try to press my way why because I'm so glad of way God brought me from and when I couldn't pay the price I realized that Christ did it for me freely he gave this thing Hallelujah the devil had you Bound in Chains and you know the thing about it is you know he paid the price not only for your salvation but he paid the price for your healing he paid the price for your deliverance he paid the price for everything oh you know he was God's Masterpiece the Bible says who ha believed our report come on he whipped the devil on every hand he paid the price if we can only understand that tonight that Jesus Paid the price amen hallelujah but the devil got got you bound don't it you know you walking around needing healing walking around around hurting in pain don't you know that Jesus Paid the price for that am those stripes come on those cow the cow tell or whatever they call they hit them with pull back the flesh it was a price paid for your healing Hallelujah and by faith if you believe it it'll work for you amen Jesus y'all believe that tonight come on but it's a price ain't it come on it's a high price come on Jesus said that you know like I said everything comes with a price you know he says what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul Hallelujah reaching for everything in this world what about your soul come on I've took care of the things that's going to get me closer to my dreams and goals today but what have you done for your soul come on what have you done to get closer to God this morning or throughout the day or did you forget about them come on you know the word is so precious Hallelujah Heaven and Earth will pass away but his words ain't going to never pass away come on it's a firm foundation it's precious more precious than the food we eat than the car you drive in in the house you live in word to God hallelujah somebody says the word brought me here come on how did I get here the word brought me here oh Jesus come on but it's so precious but what do we do with it don't even read it do we you know how how you know how much it means to you what you do with it come on how much you thought about it today Hallelujah that's how much it means me to you Church mean a lot to some people but what about the word come on that's the truth ain't it oh Jesus you know I was thinking about we said paying the price I was thinking about in the in the in the in the olden days and how they paid the price just for the Bible it was a high price to had a Bible printed in the language that you can understand what it's saying but it was precious to them it was so precious they was willing to defy the king to defy the pope to defile the laws cuz I believe when they read it something burned in their hearts Hallelujah I believe when they read it something changed in their lives something gave them Faith oh Jesus that they was willing Hallelujah to let this life go to lose it because what they was reading they know it was a better life out there oh Jesus so they was willing I was looking I said they got creative and smuggling the Bible come on they was creative with it going over here over there running hiding getting in the ship get the word out let you know you get caught with this Bible you might get burned at the Stak it's a high price but I'm willing to take that risk because this is worth more than my life this is worth more than my dreams this is worth more than my ambitions and goals so I'm willing to pay the price hallelujah oh Jesus you know I said I said you know they Burt whole family Ames for teaching their children The Lord's Prayer in English come on a lot of things they did was horrible right but it was life to them I said is the word life to you today come on I look at like I say it's paying the price I look at my own individual life we struggle with the smallest sacrifices don't we come on rising up early in the morning to pray too lazy come on can't get it up oh Jesus come on but then but then we'll be to work on time cuz you don't you going to point out you're going to lose your job well how about the one that gave you the job come on who gave you health to get up in the morning who gave you breath in your body Hallelujah who let you feel all right come on have you considered him this morning oh Jesus tonight [Laughter] tonight have you considered them I don't know about you but I considered them I said Lord thank you for giving me breath to breathe Lord thank you for giving me legs to walk and hands to clap L to praise you with thank you you didn't have to do it but you did with everything that's in me let me praise your name God let me bless you from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same because you're worthy yes you are oh Jesus he's worthy come on I like I always say sister Brenda Lewis is singing that song maybe he never dried your eyes so swollen by the tears come on in the midnight maybe he never came by and saw about you but he did for me Hallelujah and I won't forget it I won't forget what the Lord done for me I won't forget what God brought me from I won't forget when everybody walked away he stayed right there I won't forget that I won't forget it I'll remember the Lord oh Jesus don't forget them now come on have you forgotten them tonight have you forgotten where the Lord brought you from cuz everything is cake of ease now right I said paying the price come on you know we we stumble at the smallest things don't we Jesus said If any man come after me let him first deny himself in order for you to deny yourself you got to first see yourself as not being nothing come on because if you think you somebody it's going to be hard to deny yourself because of who you are what standings you got come on I like that that song brother Marshall sing everything that happened to me that was good god did it come on oh Jesus but he said you got to deny yourself you know I I says that we stumble at the the the the small all this thing come on you got to pay the price what sacrifices are you making come on if it's easy if it's easy for you to give up it wasn't a sacrifice most of the time come on you know the Bible says you bring the lame and all those things to God's Altar and give them any kind of thing come on he said give it to your Governors go do that and see how they act Hallelujah see how they react but yet you do that to me and I'm The Giver of Life I'm the Fountain of Living Waters come on I am the resurrection and the life all these other things ain't going to mean nothing all these other people ain't going to mean nothing come on in the end when you got to stand before God hallelujah oh Jesus come on Hallelujah that's said it's a price you got to pay the price are you willing to pay the price tonight come on I said it's a high price it's it's a high price you I think about that I like I said I was looking at some things and I think about I thank God that that he had even in the in the Roman Catholic Church he had some some people that really was sincere in their heart and they was willing to give up everything to get the word out to the people but God did that God put that in man's heart you know one of the guys I was talking with at work about some things and he was saying you know he was saying that's that's what kind of uh uh confuses him about the Bible is he says that you know it's been translated from this from Hebrew to Greek and Greek and then uh to to this and everybody had their own translation their own mind he say so the original was lost and he don't think it can ever you can never have the original back because it's throughout all the ages been lost we can only have bits and pieces but not the original you know but I was saying you know the thing about it is I says to myself says you know God a God that that spoke from the beginning and said let there be light was the same God that separated the light from the darkness was the same God that created the moon and the stars and the Sun and all these things and from the time he created it they still hold true right now Hallelujah now if he can do that from then until now why can't he put it in the hearts of man to bring us back a perfect word come on to bring us back a word that when we hear it it'll be just like hearing it from the lips of God himself come on he can put it in the hearts of men yes I believe he can why because our God you got to quit thinking about God like he's a man quit limiting him to science of what you can see come on God isn't limited by nothing nothing limits God it'll be just as he said and it always will be Hallelujah it'll hold true y'all believe that tonight come on don't limit him now come on don't limit him somebody says I got faith but they seeing how the situation going to work out that ain't faith faith you don't know you don't God got create come on faith walks blindly come on but the only thing about it it's not an imagination it's material it's a substance it's the real thing come on oh Jes Jesus that's what it is you got to have faith like that to know that God is going to do exactly what he said he'll do come on I was looking at uh uh last this last week I was looking at uh um in the Book of Daniel and how you know 70 weeks and all and I was looking at how you know the the one told Daniel said come on I'm going to show you what was the things are here to come herea but to begin to break down about the me pers Empire break down about the Empire coming next the Empire coming next but to bring in to show him all these things even until the end and it's my heart was just I done read it and studied it many times but my heart was so stirred because I says it was so direct come on it was so on on point that even until now everything has been just as he said it'll be so why want tomorrow the things are hold just as he said it would be come on God don't miss that's one thing about him he don't miss he don't give out something and then tomorrow change his mind about it that's why I'm so glad that God calls men men don't call God God calls men God does the choosing and he don't make no mistakes about who he chose am he said I he said all the father's given me will come and I never lost one I'm so glad about that tonight that God called me nobody can't pluck me out of his hand hallelujah oh Jesus no church can put you out no man can put you out not when God took you in Hallelujah I'm covered by the blood of Jesus Christ oh I thank God tonight how many excited tonight come on God is so good I just get so excited I was so tired a little tired but I said you know I was going to be a little just talk but I get so excited when the word coming because it's Rich come on it's life to me remember one time was sitting in the in the back office and brother Sim here recently he was saying you know we res in our whole Eternal destination on this to be the truth come on our whole life lived our whole Eternal destination we resed on this to be the truth believing that it's the truth come on and that's why we love it because it's working come on it's working for me Hallelujah you know the thing about it is like I said when they was when the when when they was bringing the Bible back in the common language you know those people were revived because it was something that was refreshing them from all the what they were taught and all the all the things they were taught they were forced into certain things forced into this religion forced and all this but then when the word started coming it was life to them it was rich it was doing something Reviving them they wern't forcing or nothing now they could they could become what they was reading because it was Reviving them come on and that's how it's got to be today with the word that's given come on not forced into it not scared into it t all these think just because I do this then I'll make it I'll this come on no that ain't no better than what they had Hallelujah but it's got to become life to you the word got to be revealed to you not by man but by the spirit of God God the holy ghost coming in your life revealing this to you Hallelujah then you live you become what's been revealed to you you got joy and unspeakable and full of Glory because you recognize who you are you recognize your day in the hour that you live in you recognize your day in this message you recognize that come on and it brought joy in your heart you know who you are you know where you going you know where you come from Hallelujah you join in tribulations and all these things because you know Hallelujah and remember oh Jesus Hallelujah all that live Godly in Christ will serf for persecution I says are you willing to pay the price tonight [Applause] amen I'm glad for the Lord despise few amen straight in the narrow way amen that's the way you choose straight narrow way the Broadway lead to destruction but amen it'll be a few that find it he says so it's by the grace of God God found us you found us amen and I'm glad he found us because what where were we going what would we become without him coming to see about us just think your life did it have real meaning because nothing in this world Amen means too much because it's like a vapor it's here today it's gone tomorrow but when you think about eternal life when you know God has given you and I eternal life it means a whole life because he's giv us of himself and he is life eternal and he's put himself inside of us he said I'm with you but I shall be in you and I'm glad that he's not just with us but he's in US directing us he's leading us and guiding us he knows the way to glory amen and all we have to do is yield to him and said not my will but thy will be done Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come what thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven amen I'm so glad that I want his will to be done in I my life how about you in your lives amen and just it doesn't matter how hard this rugged road that we are traveling on it get rough get tough the heels but he said I be with you I'll be with you always even until the end of the ages I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you so don't matter if you had to go into the lion Den he was there when in the fiery furnace he was there he said if I make my grave in hell you still find me amen it doesn't matter where where we can go that he's not there he's there so by the grace of God I thank God for you thank God for the word he paid a great price are you willing to pay the price also this Christian War this Christian Journey you got to say God Jesus paid a price for me he loved me enough to die for me and I love him back and I want to live for him I want to die to myself and I want to live there for him Lord if you can only take away my evil desires and take away this filthy garment and you said I give you a garment a Rob of pure white so that's what I want I want to lay the soul
