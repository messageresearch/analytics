[Music] the book of Exodus the 12th chapter began to reading at the 12th through the 13th I read the first you'll be the next we read the 13 together amen the prophet said when the bride recognized who she is then the Rapture would take place I believe the Rapture is waiting on you amen you can't get to heaven unless and you recognize you're in Heavenly places now you would never make it there until you identify as those that can identify themselves with the word praise God when the Bible you know many times we say when we get to heaven we're going to sing and shout if you don't do it now you ain't gonna do it then praise God you wouldn't know what to do in heaven if you don't know what to do now praise God if you don't praise him now you won't praise him when you get to heaven if you don't lift him up now you won't lift him up then amen so we got to do what act like we know who we are God bless you Revelation 12 and 3. Exodus excuse me that I says Exodus 12. and three it says speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month then they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers in lamb for and house for your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the Sheep are from the goat six kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side poles on the upper door pulls of the house when they shall eat it eight foreign at all with water but rose with fire his head with his legs and with the prince there are 10. and thus shall ye eat it with your long skirted your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hands you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover 12. together and the blood shall bead for you token unto him oh the house where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt my god let's read this words you may be seated um we're living in the evening time in the evening light messages come as a token to you and I so by the grace of God there was a message that came in the evening time of The Exodus out of Egypt God sent a messenger with a message are you with me and that messenger Moses was sent to get the people out of bondage are you with me and it was going to be quite a task because this was the greatest oh world power on the earth at that time the Egypt the Egyptians they ruled the world but yet God did not use the military force but he used a one-man invasion he told Moses I want you to go down to Egypt and I want you Amen to tell pharaoh to let my people go you know we are in sin is the type of Egypt and sin is a type of bondage and all the demons in hell in the spiritual realm are holding people in sin and in bondage and those demons amen they will not let you go free except God's sin of Moses God sent a angel with a message a message of Deliverance so God sent Moses but God that sent him God in him when God sent you he got he gets in you an authority that you have praise God is the authority that heaven is backing you up and if you got all Heaven on your side then all hell hell can be against you amen by the gates of hell should not prevail are you with me because your backing is all Heaven is with me amen if God be with us then who's favorable now well all the Demons of Hell cannot withstand and this morning I talked about the blood is the token the blood is the token and I want you to I want to remind you that the blood will never lose its power the blood will never lose its power I don't care amen what comes what goals and what is and what has been the blood will never lose its power praise God it's power in the blood in working power in the blood praise God thank God for the blood Hallelujah y'all don't want to get too excited ahead of myself but it's Power in the Blood God in my spirit as we were in prayer yesterday at the church and I I wanted to write but I had left my pen somewhere in the back and I said let me just pause for a moment that the blood has never lost his power praise God I thank God for the token this morning amen the token that has been applied in the evening time praise God Amen the prophet of God talked about the water age and praise God then he talked about the blood age and then he talks about amen the token age amen the Holy Ghost talking age the Holy Ghost is applied in this age amen praise God we had the water in the days of Noah we had the blood that Jesus shared now we have the Holy Ghost age amen so the token must be applied in this age praise God I thank God that we're in the time where the token can be applied amen I I'm so glad that amen the blood has never and will never lose its power and that's what happens to folk when their minds amen they don't have confidence in this sacrifice when you amen bring your sacrifice for sin they bought amen their sin sacrifice and they put their hand on the head of the sacrifice and when they put their hands and amen it's saying that it's innocent lamb amen was amen was taken my place and it was to cover my sins are you with me when Justice is required amen then God took an innocent sacrifice it took an a life amen it took the life of a lamb Amen to take my place and take your place are you with me so when we laid our hands then we identified with our sacrifice and I'm saying that this lamb amen is taking the place and when Justice is demanded amen Here's My Sacrifice and I'm identifying with it by placing my hand on it are you with me so when the blood is applied to the doorpost it says that I'm not ashamed of what I believe are you working there I don't care who sees the blood amen I'm I'm a witness amen praise God that I'm identifying with my sacrifice and I'm not ashamed in the school I'm not ashamed on the job they met the black the blood has been applied and I want everybody to see and know praise God that the blood has been applied and I'm not ashamed we've got too many folks that are Shame of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that a shame amen of the blood amen I'm not ashamed I want to apply the blood I don't want to put it out there where folk can see it he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen I want you to know it's not just a chemistry blood that they put there then but it seem at the life that was in the blood now and that light is to literally it's the little life of Jesus Christ are you with me it's not the life of a a blood or the bull a goat but it's the lifter life of Jesus Christ returning back in The Believer are you up there so it's his life praise God hallelujah and his life is the evidence amen the Holy Ghost is the evidence his life is the evidence that the blood has been unapplied are you a man I said the blood has been applied I don't care how much you shot how much you're dancing how much you speak in tongues I don't care what you claim remember the Holy Ghost is the literary light of Jesus Christ praise God and that little life comes into the believer and that's your token amen that the blood has been applied to my life amen some folk amen trying to claim something amen that they don't have they they're not pro they're professors but they are not possession possesses they profess something but they don't possess it are you up there you can profess that I'm a Christian and I'm saved and I'm Holy Ghost Field but you you must possess you are the person purchase possession for brother and sister it's time out for all this folk that going around trying to amen food food amen when the lamb had me be without spot would not blemish it had to be amen uh you couldn't have any uh spots and blemishes on the lamb to offer it up to God neither can we as a church this church without thought without blemish amen any such thing are you with me but what happens amen it's Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God that the Dove came down on the lamb in the form of the Holy Ghost remember the the dove amen when John said Behold the Lamb of God was taken away the sins of the what and the Holy Ghost descended in the bottom the shape of a dove because the Dove and the lamb nature amen was similar amen and the the lamb could be led by the dove are you up man but he meant the wolf amen the Holy Ghost could not come down on the wolf because the wolf got a spirit of anger are you a man so our nature God to get right before the Holy Ghost could come are you a man so this old man got to tie out are you with me and order for God natured of God's spirit to come in then there has to be a dying act to one set until we die to ourselves amen the Holy Ghost cannot come amen back on the believer because the believer amen has to have a humble Spirit he's in a humble and a contrite a broken spirit amen you've got to be a humble vessel for the Holy Ghost to come in this sin and abide there's no connection amen praise God With Us amen when we're walking in our flesh amen there's no humility amen you must become as a lamb for the lamb amen he was led as a lamb to the what to the slaughter amen he said we're killed all the day long are you up there we're counting this sheep to the water instead of Slaughter are you with me so you got to be very careful what kind of nature people are are packing amen what kind of character you have amen amen calling amen uh individuals calling themselves to be what they're not they're saying that I have the Holy Ghost so I hide the Holy Ghost but I want to I want to know amen has that humility and that nature of the Lamb amen that is being led by the dove where you lead me I follow are you up there amen it doesn't matter where you lead me I'll follow amen we're prosecuted on every side amen amen you go through persecution you gotta do things but you got to be praise God God will remain your integrity amen Joel they met didn't count amen he remained amen his integrity was still there did not of his trials and tribulation he kept his Integrity amen brother and sister amen as a Christian amen we're going to go through something it should not change our nature praise God if that nature is the Little Light Of Jesus Christ has come down in you amen then you've got to maintain your walk they've been knowing oh God that amen all things going to work together [Music] amen amen to the good to them the love the Lord God is going to walk it out to my goodness I may not see it now remember not my will but let your will be done in my life God your will be done praise God God is doing Amen to work in the inside of us thank God for God working on the inside the token brother and sister you gotta amen examine yourself and see whether you're in the faith you got to examine yourself and see whether or not you won't apply the token because a minute folk came in did not believe the report of Moses when he told them I want you to kill a lamb and I want you to apply the blood amen it didn't sound like a what some folk wanted to do because they didn't see any in need of it why should I do something like that are you up see when folk can't understand or why are they doing it then they said I ain't gonna do it because it sounds foolishness sometimes the way of a Christian walking sometimes the way God lead us in that job will come to mind we don't understand it so because we don't understand it amen we don't do it amen but well the Bible said that Josh shall walk amen and we'll live by faith amen amen not by what side we don't have to see we don't have to understand but if the word of God said it Lord I believe it because I am [Applause] child of the word my birth has been a word birthdays have not been a church birth amen has not been a religious birth but it's been a wide birth I was born again not a corruptible seed but Incorruptible by the word of God will live it and abide it forever it's a wide earth brother and sister that's what has happened I've been born again amen not by the will of the flesh not by the will of man and not by Blood amen but it was the will of God amen father let your will be done praise God your will be done amen is not what I can do but it's what he has done praise God thank God for the blood of Jesus and what Jesus did for me I identify with My Sacrifice praise God the lamb had been slain for me and I the token has been applied they met the little light of Jesus Christ has come down in me praise God don't mind me if I act like Jesus if I talk like Jesus if I walk like Jesus if I look like Jesus don't mind me amen praise God because I'm not ashamed of being a Christian I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God to Salvation to ever want to believe praise God I'm a I'm identified amen that God has given us amen a message that have called us out of dead Creeds and dogmas of denominational system and called us to be identified with Jesus Christ who is the

the Army and people were slaughtered and the blood ran into the horse's Bridal in 1870. but because the people failed to apply the blood and receive the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost which would have led them out of the slaughter that they wouldn't have remained in Jerusalem because the Holy Ghost would have told them to get out of Jerusalem because amen Titus Army was going to surround it and they wouldn't be able to get out God telling us to get out of denominational system to get out of man-made Creeds and dogmas because of time well he meant that the mark of
