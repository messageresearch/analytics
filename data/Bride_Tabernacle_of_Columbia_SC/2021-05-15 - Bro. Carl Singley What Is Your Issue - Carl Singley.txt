hymn of his gum amen we just stopped with that one scripture go to mark the fifth chapter mark five it says that when they anointed his head the ointment ran down his beard even to the skirts of his garments amen hallelujah thank you jesus start at verse 25 mark 5 and 25. the bible says amen hallelujah and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spit all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse the bible said when she heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch buddy's clothes i shall be who and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and jesus immediately knewing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and the disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude throng in thee and says thou who touched me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth hallelujah and he said unto her daughter daughter of abraham thy faith has made thee whole go in peace and behold of thy plague amen hallelujah let us just bow lord jesus as we've read to take scriptures lord jesus lord jesus we can i turn the pages of this bible lord but it takes you to bring forth the inspiration in the mighty name of jesus christ as we yield ourselves to you tonight lord jesus speak to us lord jesus through thy word lord that when we leave this place tonight lord we'll be better than we were when we came in the name of jesus christ search our hearts tonight lord jesus if there's anything in any of us lord that contrary to thy word purge it out in the name of jesus christ oh lord jesus let it be just like when prieto peter was preaching because the vows said while peter yet spake the holy ghost fell on them they heard the word hallelujah and you were the same yesterday today and forever in the mighty name of jesus christ we pray and we thank you church amen church amen again amen you may be seated in jesus christ's name amen get a little clap up from the praise if you don't mind amen we can't we can't never clap and praise him enough is that right amen but y'all cut that kind of

jesus hallelujah amen the little sounds like they just energize you amen is that right amen hallelujah what is your wish amen is that right amen and the issue is uh a subject of discussion or of interest you know say they're political you know when to come down to a presidential election they always want to discuss the issues is that right amen see that's what the platforms are built upon the issues amen an issue is a subject of discretion of of interest it's also a problem that needs to be corrected or settled amen is that right amen issues a problem or or something that needs to be corrected or settled amen i reminded in the book of first king the 18th chapter there was an issue about who was god hallelujah is that right amen the children of israel when they came out of israel amen under the under the cloud by day and out of the pillar cloud by night amen led by moses amen amen god brought them out of bondage amen but they got out into the wilderness hallelujah is that right we know that ahab married jezebel they made the zidonian amen and jezebel brought the children israel into the worship of baalism amen hallelujah and the children they forgot about the commandments of god and they were worshiping baal got to the point of what the issue was they didn't know who god well hallelujah amen is that right amen i believe it's an issue now sometimes people don't know who god is amen amen somebody people want us more to say that god is the prophet but god is jesus christ hollywood amen is all right amen but there was an issue that had to be settled amen who was god forbal god was jesus christ god amen is that right amen hallelujah so elijah amen he came he said let's have we're going to have a showdown we're going to settle this issue is that right because it was an issue that had to be settled amen hallelujah so elijah told ahab to get his prophets of the grove 450 is that right amen amen and he and he says here he has one bull for you one bullet for me you take your bullock and dress it lay it on the altar call on your god hallelujah and the god that answers by fire let him be god amen amen so the prophets of baal hallelujah they cut up the bull put it on the altar and they began to call on bill they called on bail all morning hallelujah they called on bill all the way to the midday hallelujah they called on bail and still didn't get no answer is that right hallelujah amen round about noon elijah began to mock him hallelujah said maybe he going on a trip maybe he's asleep call a little louder hey man hallelujah they began to call even loud and started cutting himself amen he's all right amen amen hallelujah amen and they called him all to toward the evening sacrifice time but they still didn't get an answer hallelujah but it came down to the time of the evening sacrifice elijah he repaired the altar is that right sometimes if you're altered you're broken now you need to prepare even your altar of prayer i mean if it's coming up short you need to repair it amen is that right holly is that right amen if your altar of worship is broken now you need to repair it amen hallelujah you're out of coming to church you need to repair that thing amen is that right hallelujah amen right amen in jesus christ but elijah repaired that altar hallelujah it meant he put the altar in place cut put the wood on the altar cut the bullet up and put him on the altar then he told him to bring four barrels of water hallelujah we know four and god's deliverance equals full vote the pneumo number four and god numerology means what deliver us amen so he told him to pull four barrels of water on it then he said do it a second time so that was eight barrels so he said do it a third time that was 12 barrels is that right and when there are twelves and god's numerology what means what worship hallelujah then it was time of the evening sacrifice and elijah paraphrasing somebody said lord i've done i've repaired your altar is that right i've laid out the sacrifice now let fire come down from heaven and all of a sudden fire came down holiday not only did it burn up the all they burned up the wood it burned up sucked up all the water burn up the dust hallelujah burn up the stones is that right it meant holly to burn it all up amen and the people fell back said the lord he is a god amen wow there was an issue that had to be settled amen there was a problem amen who was god amen so god settled that issue there at the mount karma showdown amen hallelujah is that right amen hollywood we know we're going to have the mount carmel showdown we've had that mouth cavalry showdown and there's going to be a mount zion showdown amen there's a issue who is the true bride of jesus christ hallelujah but one day even god gonna put his bride on display one day god gonna show who is the true bride of jesus christ what that day that issue is gonna be settled it's all right it may cause the bible that those who who know that god shall do explores amen amen and we know that when when the sisters crack down on us then god said what then the gods prophet said watch the third pool amen is that right amen hallelujah y'all out there tonight i don't mind you saying amen amen says come here man that's what it means is that right amen hallelujah amen hallelujah and we see that a lot of issues is going on even right now we see right now i know y'all a lot of you you young wasn't raised up during the time of the 60s but the spirit of the 60s is back among us it's back on us right now amen we see racism everywhere right during the time of the 60s there was a lot of there was a lot of racism black man amen you couldn't even walk down the street but they'd take it out take out just beat you up police didn't do nothing about it men would come into a man's house and lay with his wife he couldn't do anything about it hallelujah amen you couldn't vote is that right you couldn't you you had had separate uh bathroom that white people white ladies colored women white men colored men he's all right they separated couldn't go to school together hallelujah amen but while all of this was going on amen black people were trying to get social change right we didn't know that it was a prophet on the scene amen we didn't know there was a prophet on the scene coming he came right here to columbia we didn't know nothing about it amen hallelujah and god in in in tight there was this a little shooter my woman right that had a son that was sick amen hallelujah the prophet he was on the airplane he met an airplane stopped at the airport amen and he uh began to go walk while they had to repair the airplane and he began to walk the lord told him keep walking keep walking baby keep walking he walked going on up the street and as he got up the street there was this little black lady hanging on the fence with ragti around the head she looked at him she said more than parsons he said how do you know i'm a person he said the lord told me you was coming hey man she said i got a son in there and he's sick on the bed and he's sick with a social disease hallelujah you know what he had gotten a venereal disease amen which was a social disease amen to make a story short amen the prophet he went in there in the house and he prayed and he said that little lady prayed he said boy you could tell she she been praying because she really laid down a prayer here man hallelujah but he prayed for the son a child because he was on the bed he meant talking out of his head amen because he had the social disease so the prophet as he prayed he went back to the apple he had been gone for several hours amen and but as soon as he got back there he said the last call for a certain number of flight hallelujah in other words that little blight lady's prayer had held up that airplane is that right amen hallelujah amen i said this in type that during the 1960s 1963 after them seals was open the rapture was ready to go there is that right about in the days of the voice of the seventh century when he began to sound the mystery of god shall be finished is that right hallelujah amen it was finished he's right but see god held that rapture up because we black people weren't ready that's the truth is that right amen we were too busy worrying about social change say it loud i'm black and i'm proud anyway brother simmer probably had afro on his head he's on it is that right here right it got what trying to get social change i mean we wasn't ready for it amen so god held that thing up amen but see we're backing now in the spirit of the sixes again racism space travel is that right amen see they changed up the voting laws again back then in the 60s we couldn't we black people couldn't even vote you did you vote you had to go to the poll pay a poll attack is that right you had to read a little piece of paper hallelujah now they change their laws and voting roles around again but one thing about it this time and we're on the verge of the rapture again y'all believe that amen y'all believe it hear me lord servant said when they get them to call shaped like eggs that we would have those before the rapture and we got them is that right amen he even said it it will come a time when a lady was going to be elected even president or vice president is that right we gotta is that right amen there's one more vision that got to be fulfilled he got because god probably had seven visions and there's only one motive he feel and that's with the atom bomb going to hit united states but between the time of the atom bomb falling is that right and this woman being elected uh president or vice president a rapture that's going to take place but the measuring stick of it that shows you just how close we are amen y'all believe it amen amen we we're that close and i was already none of those visions he had vision of 1933 none of them has failed and see if there's only one left and you don't want to be here when that one's coming that's when america is going to be hit with an atom bomb amen amen we see we sowed the atom bomb amen we going to reap it amen ain't because to be not to god does not mock whatever man so the shall he reap revelation 13 shows where we sowed that atom bomb when we dropped it on nakazaki and hiroshima amen hallelujah amen so we're going to get an atom bomb dropped back onto us amen but in between that time a rapture is going to take place so now there ain't no time to get slack because all right now it's running time now it's pressing time y'all believe it amen if you've got any issues at night jesus is here tonight to solve any issues you got tonight amen hollywood is all right jesus christ is here amen any time jesus is present there's always power to heal there's always power to deliver there's always power to set free amen is that right there's always power to to purge out our heart amen amen so if you got any issues tonight amen jesus is here holly amen he's here amen i believe amen i'm crazy enough to believe he said what two or three believers are gathered in my name there i am in the midst that jesus christ is the same yesterday the day and forever amen is that right amen i reminded when he got ready to send moses back down into egypt even he said moses i've heard the cry of my people and i've come down but i'm sending you holiday amen moses said lord i can't even talk right god didn't paraphrase need more said that's just where i want you is that right hallelujah amen but moses said lord who shall i say send me hallelujah moses wanted a name that had some authority amen is that right and jesus said god he told moses to tell him that i am that i am sent you hallelujah amen is that right even though he said tell them i'm the same yesterday today and forever amen because jesus jehovah the old testament is jesus of the new testament amen jesus christ is the same yesterday the day and forever amen he is the i am i am is a state of being is that right even he's a state of being whatever you need him to be i am you need a job i am you need peace i am you need finances i am you need help i am he's all right amen hallelujah you need a husband i am you need a wife i am amen is that right whatever you need him to be healed amen amen he said he who comes to god must believe that he is hey man whatever you need him to be he is all right amen that's us jesus he god is a state of being amen that why they say god heals love is that right it's a state of being amen he always is love is that right he never had he's always loved amen is that right it may he even love the young rich ruler amen that turned down eternal life but god looked at me and said the bible said god looked at him he loved but god knew he was going to turn him down even he knew judah was going to go don't go on betraying but he looked at jesus he still called him friend hallelujah amen because a friend should love at all time do you have an issue of not loving at all times do you have an issue of not loving it man search your heart amen is that right ain't nothing to go in that rapture but perfect love is that right amen nothing but perfect love amen hallelujah and it's a test on us right now amen i'm just speaking to you as a black bride with this racism it's it's a test on us that we can still love even though it's a man may hurt you just because of your color of your skin is that right but we as a black bride we still got to live anyway is that right it may cause forgiveness requires forgiveness is that right jesus said if you don't forgive me in that trespass and neither will i forgive you or your trespass even therefore forgiveness requires forgiveness hallelujah amen right amen because if you don't forgive somebody they're going to grow up into a root of bitterness is that right and if the rule of bitterness grow up in you then you're going to be defiled hallelujah ain't nothing defiled is going in the rapture amen amen is that right amen hallelujah god we got to be that amen we've got to be the word amen god has sent the revelation to god's word amen amen the bible said zechariah 14 to 7 i believe it here amen say there come a time we're going to be neither day no night but in evening time it shall be light hallelujah amen is that a rise and shine before so your light has come amen is that right and the glory of god is written upon you amen but you ever thought about what came out of that light what came out of that light the revelation of jesus christ what came out of that light the name of jesus christ what came out of that light the true revelation of the true baptism of jesus christ right amen y'all believe it what else came out of that light huh that we we know that hell is not eternal hallelujah right well that's coming out of light we know that israel was blinded for our sake right amen when you see the pictures of the holocaust even that revelation struck me one day i saw these bodies stacked up like cord wood right there where they had killed them in ospreys in all those places amen and starved them to death and to pile their bodies up like wood i looked at it one day i said lord jesus they'll pile up like that for me is that right because jesus blinded their eyes that would they would not recognize him that we might have a right to the tree of life is that right hallelujah amen yes it did is it right amen holiday paul clinton when you know they had that custom on the day where they would deliver release one man one man on that day of deliverance and they asked him to who shall i just deliver unto you they said barabbas he said well then what shall i do with jesus which is called christ he said crucify him amen is that right he said his blood be on us and on our children one of the biggest mistakes the jews could have made is that right amen because from then on they've been persecuted all around the world amen during world war ii amen hitler mussolini amen even stalin amen persecuted the jews amen they may kill them by the thousands by the millions hallelujah amen but they went through all of that for you and i amen because if they had recognized him which israel was taught to recognize their prophets is right amen amen because the little woman that samara she she recognized is that right amen the woman when he spoke he did that discernment to her even is that right anybody said go and get your husband says that i have none he said you have rightly said you have five and one you're with now and not josh he said sir i perceive that you are a prophet i'm just preaching that you're a messiah because we know that when messiah comes he gonna do that hallelujah amen so if jesus hadn't blinded the eyes of those jews they would have recognized him and we gentile dogs wouldn't have a right to the tree of life but god in his rich mercy and his grace blinded the apples of his eye that we made gentile dogs may have a right to the tree of life amen is that right i thank god for his mercy thank god for his grace is that right amen i thank him amen that he loved me so much it meant that he was blind the apple of his eye that i might have a chance a right to the tree of life amen amen that's why god amen even now hallelujah even he god he don't hate us sinner is that right he only hated a sinner because a senator refused to accept the pardon that he's given to him amen is that right amen because we was all born in sin shaving the neck would come in the world speaking lies is that right amen but god made a way that we can get out of being the sinner amen but what upset god is when a man choose to remain a sinner even after he made a way of escape hallelujah in the name of jesus christ hallelujah jesus christ's name i love him amen hallelujah bride of jesus christ amen god blinded them jews that's why we know what came out of the light the revelation that god had blinded them jews that we may have a right to the tree of life amen right amen and you know it was other mysteries and uh that's been revealed lately we won't have time to go and all of them even but i just want to show that that's what came out of that light even one thing that came out of the light there so back to our lesson there an issue we said is a problem that needs to be corrected amen we read the script in psalm 133 say how uh sweden and how do sweden how good it is for brother to dwell together in unity is that right amen and see there's one one do we have an issue of unity amen not being unified we need to join together as one amen the bible said a threefold chord is hard to breathe holly you me and the holy ghost amen amen that court is hard to break is that right amen to jesus christ's name hallelujah that precious oil went in in that they pray poke that oil on ariel's head the bible said he would pull it on his head and went down to his beard even down to the him the skirts of his garment amen aaron was a high priest amen is that right aaron was the high priest and abram was anointed from the head all over his body amen amen is that right amen in jesus christ's name y'all love it amen we i'm reminded in the book of luke 17 amen amen when jesus was walking through jerusalem he went through some mary and all those and they stood ten levels hallelujah standing to fall the one thing about leprosy when they got leopa got leprosy leprosy is a type of sin until we know through by revelation but if this physical leprosy they were separated from the camp they couldn't even come into the camp because of the leper say amen that's why the bible said they stood to fall off and they cried out to jesus lord have mercy on me and jesus told him to go and show

about how he had healed other people living how he had me he took the five fishes and a couple loads of bread and fed all them thousands of people she had heard about his marriage amen so he was coming through the land that she pressed amen through the crowd just to touch to him of his gun is that right and the bible said when he touched him of his gummy her blood flow stopped hallelujah right then why because she caught the revelation that jesus christ was the high priest jesus christ was anointed all over even his clothes amen is that right and i believe tonight if you have an issue you got a circumstance you got a condition amen that jesus christ is here tonight amen and you can touch him tonight is that right amen you everything things that you may may be carrying maybe having you burned down things you may need help upon hallelujah is that right amen you may be seeking your body tonight jesus is here to heal you you may be troubled in your mind jesus is here to clear up your mind is that right amen see jesus when he hung on that cross hallelujah you read all points of his body was a salty amen he said all of his bones was out of joint none of his bones was broken but all of his bones out of joint is that right they assaulted his body in every point amen they beat him on his elbow they beat him on his knees they beat him on his back they beat him on his head to beat him on his chest amen beat him on his knees beat him on his leg hallelujah what was jesus doing jesus was paying for every ache of pain that we could ever have is that right amen hallelujah amen you gotta got a leg and knee knee hurting is painful your arms hurt it's painful you know jesus you wonder why he came as a baby amen hallelujah everybody was looking for a king to come right in the horses that jesus came as a baby because he needed to grow up to see what a baby goes through is that right amen he by him growing up as a baby did he know that the trials and the tribulation the circumstances the conditions that a baby go through and therefore as he went through that then he could pay for that he's all right even therefore to win a little bit little baby get sick now it's already paid for amen because see jesus he tested it all tried it all the bible said he was in all points tempted yet without sin in the name of jesus christ hallelujah so therefore our circumstance our conditions is that right our issues amen that we may have given to him is that right give them to him amen hallelujah if you're fearful if you need a job if you need a wife you you need consoling in any kind of way all you got to do is come and touch the hymn of his gummy today amen amen and you're touching them by faith amen in the name of jesus christ do y'all love him amen hallelujah jesus

if your cup is empty he can even fill your cup tonight in the name of jesus christ do y'all love him tonight amen in jesus christ's name y'all love him amen amen and jesus christ like i said he he because we're in that high priest say man you know that high priest he had to be dressed a certain way and he he can only go behind that bear once again but he had to have blood amen and though he on him of his gummy he had bells and pomegranates so that when he whenever he walked all you could hear was the sound of holy holy holy amen that should be the walk of our life wherever we go we should be the sound that our life should be radiating holiness is that right holiness is not a denomination holiness is a way of life amen the bible says follow peace with all men that holiness without the witch no man shall see god amen is that right amen and see we and god has has washed us from our sin in his own blood and he has made us kings and priests is that right amen hallelujah he's made us kings and priests amen right amen because jesus said the works that i do shall you do even greater works because i go to the father amen there's nothing we can do greater than raise the dead right nothing doesn't that we can do greater than create a bread and cook fish everybody feed people amen hallelujah but the thing over there is more to it amen more of us doing that same thing amen that's where the greater work's in but what the true greater work is is that we are able to impart eternal life to somebody amen amen we can impart eternal life because we have the word of reconciliation and we got the word that can bring people back to god amen is that right amen because the word of god is is eternal amen and jesus christ is a true god and eternal life amen so if we can re introduce a person to jesus christ amen we're actually imparting eternal life to them and that's one of the greatest work amen as a lord servant said one of the greatest miracles there is is a changed life amen amen because you can get healed amen you but you'll get sick again right amen amen you may be in a wheelchair get up and walk out of here but you could get back in that wheelchair again amen amen but

amen amen amen to buy a soul is that right a soul that works a thousand worlds amen amen because that's why jesus said soul winners they are wise amen is that right amen are you are we why so amen we're like like jesus he he told peter he said i'm gonna make you officials of me why because peters knew how to fish is that right god didn't take that fishing skill away from him amen right he just took it and start bringing in me and instead of fish is that right because you know you can you can you if you know anything about fishing you can have a good hook but that hook can be too big is that right in other words you can you can shatter the truth of that word but it's too strong that the person can't can't handle it amen so you have to use a smaller hook sometimes they mean you have to use simplicity of the word of god a lot of times amen amen amen i remember one time i shared a lesson one time a brother came up to me i know he was saying it for himself he said most brother would say that lesson that you just shared was a shallow lesson i said yeah brother but tell me where did they catch the fish yet they caught them in shallow water is that right is that right amen amen whenever fish get debris where do you come from you come to shallow water is that right and jesus said make it so simple that even the food went here hear me is that right because god is hidden in simplicity but yet revealed in the same amen hallelujah amen in jesus christ tonight y'all love him in jesus christ's name hallelujah amen so what what is any issues tonight amen let us just bow in jesus
