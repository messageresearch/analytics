Christ's wonderful name amen the book of Second Kings praise God God is good amen amen Second Kings 6 and 16 you understand that Elijah and his servant was out and uh the Syrian Army was all around the city where they were because Elijah was telling the king the king of Israel what was going on and with the Assyrians and they could understand how come they knew everything they were doing so here he says they discovered that it was Elijah that was telling it so they wanted to do something about it and they sent a great task of army to confront and the deal with Elijah and he answered fear not Elijah's servant he he was wondering what we going to do he let's read the 15th verse and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth and behold and host can pass the city both of horses and chariots and his servant said unto him Elias my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than them that what be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord and said Lord I pray thee what open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold a mountain was full of what amen God bless you read words you may be seated see sometimes we think we're in the we're in this [Music] alone sometimes we think we we we're just here alone sometimes we think that the battle that we're fighting that we're in the we're in the e be privileged to something that's going to happen and we can know what's going on and it might be you know it might be an an attack against us but a lot of times but it's an unseen Force unseen real sometimes the devil is instigating and the devil is setting a trap for you bless bless and all he wants you to do is react and respond but often times all we got to do is just don't worry about it amen God you got everything under control amen amen but a lot of times we follow up situation because we look to the five senses right so uh the contact our Earthly home we deal with the uh the three dimensions light uh matter and time amen and sometimes because of this body we're trapped it's almost like we're in a prison and you know we doing time and we we're trapped in time but we are Eternal beings we we come from God we were amen meant to be Sons and Daughters of Christ God but because of sin amen we fell from the grace of God but by the grace of God when God is trying to bring us and something inside of us we're groaning for we're groaning because we know we're not in our ought to be conditioned we're not in our right condition this body amen so when we receive the Holy Ghost when we receive the the uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost it tells us amen it calls us up a little higher it Lift us up out of the power of Darkness translates us into the kingdom of De son and sometimes is invisible but it's real to us amen we know what God has done in our lives it's an unseen real but we see amen amen because we know the effect of the gospel and the power of the Gospel in our lives we know what Jesus has done for us so as it is in these three dimension then we uh communic there's a communication Dimension amen where you deal with the fourth dimension and you're going into the channel of communication radio television and we call it the the information of the Super Highway sometimes and we got the internet we got uh computers and we got Ai and all of that so we're going into that fourth dimension the scientific Dimension are you with me so uh uh the world of the Unseen things are happening right now in this room amen that you can't see amen Elijah's servant amen thought that amen the the Syrian Army what we going to do and you might have situation that you're dealing with what we going to do and I said Lord amen don't fear open their eyes that you can understand that if God be us yes who can be against us and and they that's with us is more than them that is against us but you need to recognize that God said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'm with you and I'll be with you always there's an innumerable company of angels Jesus said amen no man take my life I lay it down amen and I got power to raise it up again and when they came to get him he said amen don't you worry about a thing don't you know I got power to call 12 Legion of angels praise God Amen when he was going through his uh time in Gethsemane amen he was being

from the Lord praise God I'm been influenced amen amen from amen having a another dimension another realm I'm getting my influence but the world itself is being influenced amen from this uh scientific world and and then the intertwining Into The Fifth Dimension which deals with the regon of the lost and uh the region of demon spirits and hell and Satan uhhuh amen is almost as the prophet said it came on the earth when he was in JC pendence and the woman were coming down the esalat and he saw amen this woman and it was like what he was when he was uh losing and and find himself in hell he saw the same thing with the woman not necess amen she look like what hell look like what the people look like in hell so the dimensions are blending hell is coming on Earth amen as hell is coming on Earth and amen the world is blending in to that demon Force that's why the people are piercing and they're tattooing and they're doing all kind of crazy stuff and they think they look they look like the demons out of the bottomless pit amen praise God and they're being influenced from an Unseen World and they are taking on that influence and it came very strong to me amen you and I are being influenced from above and God Is Lifting us up out of here we're being called to high a calling Amen to lift up out of this uh temporal scene for he said the things that are are not seen are Eternal but the things that are seen are temporal they only for season they're only going to last a little while but the things that are unseen amen praise God those things are Eternal amen but I'm talking about an unseen diens but Unseen World but it's real amen it's more real than amen praise God your soul is more real than your body are you with me you have been influenced by evil spirits they anoint you and try to get tra you into a demonic Rim they try to get your mind captivated but we understand that Jesus when he rose he led captivity captive am praise God and he made an open sh them telling
