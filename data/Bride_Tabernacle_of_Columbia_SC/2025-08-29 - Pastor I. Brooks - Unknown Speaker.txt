And uh it's a privilege to meet brethren of like precious faith &gt;&gt; uh seated around the throne of grace here this this afternoon. How many on expectation tonight? &gt;&gt; We didn't come to meet man but we come to meet with almighty God. Hallelujah. And we believe that tonight you know the where the saints of God are gathered. There are angels all around. There's a supernatural waiting to be man manifest tonight. If we could only believe what we come expecting is what we would receive tonight. So we come with our cups emptied and lifted up and brother we under expectation for God to fill it up for us tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. I remember one time in the days of Elijah when uh the the host of the Syrians came against Israel and they would make their plans to come and destroy the armies of Israel. But there was a prophet in the land. Hallelujah. And the prophet will warn the king of all the ambushes that the Syrians laid. We know the story. &gt;&gt; And the Syrian king, he got upset after a while. He said, "There's a traitor amongst us. Someone is telling &gt;&gt; the king of Israel where we are." &gt;&gt; But there was a man in this camp. Hallelujah. That knew the capability, the ability of a prophet. Hallelujah. And he said, "No, there's no traitor amongst us, but there is a prophet amongst them." &gt;&gt; That when the things you speak in your bed chamber, he hears it. Hallelujah. Glory. And we thank God for sending us a prophet in this hour, brother, that has sent us a message that we can know the things that were in the back part of God's mind as we thank God for our brother that came and showed us, brother, we came from somewhere and we are going back to that place. Hallelujah. Glory be to God in the highest. And they came against the the host of the Syrian came to find Elijah. And the Elijah had a servant with him. And when he realized what was going on, he said, "Master, look at the Syrian host is coming." He said, "Lord, open the boy eyes." And when his eyes were opened, brother, he saw the whole host of the mountain, chariots of fire all around. Hallelujah. He said, "Master, Alex, there is more with us than be with them. And tonight, there is more supernatural. If God could only open our eyes to receive and believe, brother, we wouldn't leave here the same way that we came in tonight." Hallelujah. So may that supernatural influence our lives tonight, brother. Influence these meetings, brother. When we leave here, our lives could be changed and we'll never be the same again by God's grace. God bless you. We love you all. Shalom, brother Jimmy Mikash from Zambia, Africa. Hallelujah. God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; It's good that we're back again. Amen.

So, we're down there. Amen. We want I want to appreciate the Lord for the invitation to to come over here. I believe uh I was here just a few months ago and we had a good time together. Brother Henry told me that there's going to be a 10 meetings. I said I I would I I'd really love to attend. Amen. So I called him. I was just checking the dates. I was like when are the meetings I may come then he told me you can't say that you you are part of the preachers. Uh you told me you'd been in the states this period.

I I I maybe I'll call him over to come to Zambia to come and do the tent for us as a start if God permits. Amen. So, we are under a lot of expectations. Uh just a little word like just to follow the method my friends were doing. They were saying something. So I just want to remember when uh the armies of Israel gathered against the Philistines and among them there was a Goliath. &gt;&gt; He was insulting the armies of God and uh the people were afraid but uh there's a time that he insulted at the wrong time because there was David in the camp. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Your sickness may have been insulting you over these years, but they have in they're going to insult at this wrong time because we are in the presence of God. If that sickness you came over with it, it has insulted at the wrong time. Uh we are going to bring it down. Uh it's going to be cast out. Uh you're going to be free tonight. Uh just come under a lot of expectation. Amen. Your scene has insulted at the wrong time. We are in the presence of God.
