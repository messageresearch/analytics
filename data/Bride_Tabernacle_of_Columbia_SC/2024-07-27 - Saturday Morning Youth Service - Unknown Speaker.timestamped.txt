[58:34] bless you I'm I'm going to show the
[58:36] mercy and goodness and I'm going to let
[58:38] God know um that I appreciate him so I
[58:41] want to give a testimony um for me I
[58:43] don't know my name is Brother Steve
[58:45] Evans I'm from Life tabernac Florence um
[58:47] brother Pastor Fred mull Church um and I
[58:50] just want to get a testimony of God
[58:52] mercy and his grace and hopefully this
[58:54] testimony can encourage um any one out
[58:56] there and we just started sharing this
[58:58] testimony so 8 years ago I have three
[59:00] children um Haven which is 10 and I have
[59:04] twins Eli and Eden um and me and my wife
[59:08] which is coming in
[59:10] now come on you know I got to
[59:13] testify yes sir um in life we make some
[59:20] ignorant
[59:21] decisions right we we do things that we
[59:25] often we don't pray about we we really
[59:28] don't seek God for his guidance we go
[59:30] off of
[59:32] self-will um and so me and my wife you
[59:34] know our first daughter Haven was a twin
[59:38] um and we lost one kind of early and
[59:40] then we had twins again so we said the
[59:42] risk of having another one will be twins
[59:45] again and we didn't want to take that
[59:47] risk um and so we told the doctor to
[59:50] remove her tro
[59:52] completely don't tie them don't burn
[59:54] them take take them out we didn't seek
[59:58] God we didn't ask for his guidance we
[1:00:00] did us all
[1:00:01] self-will right which we all know we've
[1:00:04] done um we we tend don't go to the
[1:00:07] perfect will of God we we stay in the
[1:00:10] permissive will hoping that God brings
[1:00:11] us back to the perfect will so years
[1:00:14] later we decided you know what we want
[1:00:16] another
[1:00:17] child and thinking like well naturally
[1:00:20] that's not possible to
[1:00:23] man we say we want another child
[1:00:27] I want I wanted one more but you can't
[1:00:29] ask God for one more especially when you
[1:00:32] already know what you've
[1:00:33] done so one day in church our pastor
[1:00:36] asked who wants to have a child and so
[1:00:39] sometimes you ignorant you caught up in
[1:00:41] the faith you just do things off
[1:00:43] Instinct I raised my
[1:00:46] hand and so for for one point is that's
[1:00:50] why we have to be careful when we under
[1:00:51] the anointing of what you ask for right
[1:00:55] because God will give you your heart's
[1:00:56] desire so you have to be cautious cuz it
[1:00:59] be something that can hurt you but
[1:01:02] because he see your heart's desire and
[1:01:03] you keep asking for it he'll give it to
[1:01:05] you but I raised my hand and I said I
[1:01:08] want another child and everybody's
[1:01:11] laughing and so I kept going we had a
[1:01:14] woman's night um at the church and my
[1:01:18] wife had to wrote several things down
[1:01:20] and the fifth thing she wrote down was
[1:01:22] she wanted to have a baby naturally now
[1:01:25] again remind you
[1:01:27] we already took the tubes out so in our
[1:01:30] minds that's not possible they said the
[1:01:32] only way you can get pregnant is by
[1:01:34] fertility we didn't want to go that
[1:01:36] route so she put it in the Bible she put
[1:01:38] it in Acts
[1:01:41] okay so then she comes around she says
[1:01:43] Steve my pyet come
[1:01:49] on so I start to get kind of like well
[1:01:52] what's going
[1:01:53] on so I said you you know let's get a
[1:01:56] pregnancy test Let's test this out the
[1:01:59] pregnancy test came back it was a faint
[1:02:01] line so then I started taking a seat
[1:02:03] back said hold on now something
[1:02:05] something let's take another pregnancy
[1:02:07] test she took another one it was a faint
[1:02:10] line now please don't laugh when I tell
[1:02:12] you this cuz I'm I'm telling you this
[1:02:14] cuz I want to tell my testimony High my
[1:02:15] ignorance was a blessing yes so just to
[1:02:18] make sure the preg test wasn't voided I
[1:02:21] took the pregnancy
[1:02:23] test sir and it came back negative so I
[1:02:26] already
[1:02:27] knew
[1:02:30] okay cuz if I don't if I don't tell it
[1:02:33] exactly you want to appreciate God's
[1:02:35] mercy and his
[1:02:36] grace right so then we waited a couple
[1:02:39] days
[1:02:40] later and she got the test that says yes
[1:02:43] or no come on come on and so we took it
[1:02:46] and it says yes so I said something's
[1:02:48] not right like in my mind as much as I
[1:02:51] already see the evidence of God I'm
[1:02:54] trying to deny it
[1:02:56] right I'm saying well take a fourth one
[1:03:00] let's be sure not like the first one
[1:03:03] when he said God heard him to Daniel I
[1:03:05] heard you the first time Lord but see a
[1:03:08] lot of times we reason and doubt when
[1:03:10] God said I heard you the first time but
[1:03:12] he just waiting on us to fully believe
[1:03:15] that all things are possible so we said
[1:03:18] well let's schedule a doctor
[1:03:19] appointment okay now my heart's beating
[1:03:21] a little bit so we go to the doctor and
[1:03:25] we sitting there and it's the same lady
[1:03:28] the ultrasound like the same lady that
[1:03:29] was with my daughter has been the whole
[1:03:31] she she automatically says girl you
[1:03:33] pregnant with
[1:03:34] twins I said
[1:03:36] twins can't be
[1:03:40] how so we going to doctor's office and
[1:03:42] the doctor the same doctor that deliver
[1:03:44] all three of my kids well the two the
[1:03:46] three he said do y'all take some type of
[1:03:48] drugs for you had to do something we
[1:03:51] said no we didn't do anything we said
[1:03:53] how is it possible now he's been in
[1:03:55] medicine 30 years and now doctor is
[1:03:57] telling me how is this
[1:03:59] possible so God had given me the unction
[1:04:02] to do something I took the letter that
[1:04:04] my wife had wrote in Acts and I had it
[1:04:07] with me that day and I pulled it out now
[1:04:09] it's time to
[1:04:10] testify and I showed him well my wife
[1:04:13] this is what she wrote down this is not
[1:04:15] by coincidence this is something we
[1:04:16] asked for and so in that doctor's office
[1:04:20] he cried wow because he saw the power of
[1:04:24] God
[1:04:26] and at that moment I knew God was I
[1:04:29] already knew God was real but at that
[1:04:32] moment I knew God had done something no
[1:04:34] matter what I go through in my life
[1:04:36] moving forward no matter what that God
[1:04:39] is real to
[1:04:42] me so we went to the doctor he said
[1:04:44] let's come back in a few weeks and God
[1:04:46] know desire of our heart he knew two
[1:04:48] more babies would be tough right so he
[1:04:52] blessed us with one one did not make it
[1:04:55] which I am totally great with the
[1:04:57] perfect will of God cuz he knew we could
[1:04:58] hand another one so then my second
[1:05:00] question is I want a boy come on right
[1:05:03] if if you want something from God you
[1:05:05] got to be what specific right and so I
[1:05:09] want a boy not necessarily I didn't want
[1:05:11] another girl but I wanted a boy to go
[1:05:13] with my son Eli and God bless us with
[1:05:15] another
[1:05:16] boy so my testimony is amen try
[1:05:21] God if you if you don't have a
[1:05:23] relationship with him try him amen if
[1:05:25] you haven't talked to him in a while try
[1:05:27] him to my sisters if you want a baby the
[1:05:31] same thing he did for my
[1:05:33] wife we're no we're not special there's
[1:05:36] nothing we did we just had a sincere
[1:05:39] heart and we tried him try God Lord give
[1:05:44] him another opportunity to show you who
[1:05:46] he is and I promise you he won't fail If
[1:05:49] He Did It Before He'll Do It
[1:05:53] Again the Lord
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:03] anybody else praise the Lord okay all
[1:06:06] right buddy
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:25] I'll be loud hey man God bless the
[1:06:28] Saints um my name is brother Timothy
[1:06:30] Milton from Virginia um fellowshiping
[1:06:32] with brother Kelvin Mo and Elizabeth
[1:06:33] City North Carolina I just want to give
[1:06:36] God thanks like the brother said if God
[1:06:38] give you an opportunity to testify of
[1:06:39] his goodness you take that opportunity
[1:06:42] amen so I just want to give God thanks
[1:06:43] um about how he spared my life a little
[1:06:45] while ago uh I used to work at a uh
[1:06:48] small construction company based in uh
[1:06:50] Portsmouth
[1:06:52] Virginia and this we uh we did kind of
[1:06:55] various types of work from cutting grass
[1:06:57] to building stuff to HVAC all kinds of
[1:07:00] stuff so um on this particular day we
[1:07:02] know we had worked all day we worked the
[1:07:04] whole shift and so we were my manager
[1:07:07] and I we just it was him and I we went
[1:07:09] out to do a job in uh my city where I
[1:07:11] live suff
[1:07:13] Virginia and so we're out in this yard
[1:07:15] this backyard helping another crew dig
[1:07:17] some holes to put a fence up and so with
[1:07:20] us we brought a tractor along and an
[1:07:21] augur for those who don't know who an
[1:07:22] augur is it's like a giant blade you're
[1:07:24] drilling the ground with well this this
[1:07:25] one is a little bigger cuz it's ATT
[1:07:27] tractor attachments it's about know this
[1:07:29] tall as a spiral blade but um so we
[1:07:32] bring this along you know we're out here
[1:07:33] digging holes so we dig a couple of them
[1:07:36] but in this yard it's like a lot of
[1:07:38] stuff up under the dirt that we can't
[1:07:39] see like bricks and tree roots and all
[1:07:41] kinds of stuff so know we get to dig in
[1:07:43] a couple of holes next you know the
[1:07:45] blade starts getting caught and the bolt
[1:07:46] that holds it together snap so like well
[1:07:49] that was quick guess we're done here the
[1:07:51] guy like hold on hold on I think I might
[1:07:52] got another another bolt in my truck so
[1:07:54] he goes and gets it now we we shouldn't
[1:07:57] have Jimmy rigged it we shouldn't have
[1:07:58] you know put something in place that
[1:08:00] didn't belong there but you know we put
[1:08:02] it up there we kept on going so a couple
[1:08:05] holes later that one broke she's like
[1:08:07] all right he's like I think I got some
[1:08:08] more we going to do this as long as it
[1:08:09] takes till we get all the way around
[1:08:10] this
[1:08:11] yard you know I'm seeing this thing I'm
[1:08:13] watching this blade I'm just singing in
[1:08:14] amazement I'm watching this thing just
[1:08:15] slic through bricks and tree roots I'm
[1:08:17] like I hate to be caught in that so you
[1:08:20] know we get to going around and we get
[1:08:21] to the um the very last hole now in this
[1:08:25] backyard it's kind of like a bushy area
[1:08:27] and it got like a little bit of a fence
[1:08:29] and so the way this um tractor arur
[1:08:31] worked he would like raise and lower it
[1:08:34] but like I had to like guide it cuz it
[1:08:35] was like kind of at an angle so I had to
[1:08:38] hold a lever to keep it straight so it
[1:08:40] drill straight down so that was my job I
[1:08:42] hold it in place while he drills up and
[1:08:43] brings it up I tell him when to go down
[1:08:45] tell him when to go up so you know we
[1:08:47] get to this last hole and the way it's
[1:08:48] set up I'm like how we going to do this
[1:08:50] cuz either I'm going to be back in the
[1:08:52] bushes like up against the fence like
[1:08:54] this while the blad like right here in
[1:08:55] front of me or he just going to have to
[1:08:57] like drill it in sideway so I'm like you
[1:08:58] know all right I'll get back there so
[1:09:00] I'm back here I'm drilling but before I
[1:09:02] tell him to go down give him the okay to
[1:09:03] go down I see like a little bit of wire
[1:09:05] like chicken wire and stuff down there
[1:09:06] so I'm like hold on hold on so I get it
[1:09:08] out the way a little bit I didn't know
[1:09:09] there was like more that was up under
[1:09:11] there so now I give him the thumbs up
[1:09:13] you know go ahead and start drilling so
[1:09:15] he starts drilling down and that blade
[1:09:17] starts getting like caught up in the
[1:09:18] chicken wire so I'm seeing this is kind
[1:09:20] of going crazy like it's getting caught
[1:09:22] up all up in the wire the blad starting
[1:09:23] to go crazy so I'm like okay let me get
[1:09:25] from back here cuz you know this is too
[1:09:27] close to me I'm standing right here back
[1:09:28] up against the bushes I ain't got
[1:09:29] nowhere to go so let me get out from
[1:09:32] around
[1:09:33] here I tell him I said you know it's
[1:09:35] just bring it up we got to get the rest
[1:09:36] of this out the way bring it up so I go
[1:09:39] to step out from around it and because
[1:09:41] it's getting all caught in this wire
[1:09:43] that bolt snapped again well because he
[1:09:45] was bringing it up and that bolt snapped
[1:09:46] again this time while I was stepping out
[1:09:48] from around it that blade swung caught
[1:09:50] me in the leg took me off my feet and
[1:09:53] started like getting into my leg a
[1:09:55] little bit well it wasn't his leg it was
[1:09:56] his leg but started getting into my leg
[1:09:58] a little bit so you know he tried to
[1:10:00] shut it off but you know it don't shut
[1:10:01] off like immediately so the blad got a
[1:10:03] slow to a
[1:10:05] stop so you know he asked me you know
[1:10:07] are you all right I thought my leg was
[1:10:08] gone cuz you know I it was like it
[1:10:10] happened so fast but so slow at the same
[1:10:12] time thinking like well my legs going I
[1:10:14] ain't feel the pain yet but I thought I
[1:10:16] was in shock or something so you know I
[1:10:18] get up or try to get up at first I
[1:10:20] couldn't get up then I Tred it again so
[1:10:21] I'm thinking like oh man like maybe my
[1:10:23] legs just sprang so you know it was it
[1:10:24] was hurting but it wasn't feeling too
[1:10:26] bad so he's like you know take your shoe
[1:10:28] off take your um roll your pants and
[1:10:30] make sure you ain't all cut up by God's
[1:10:31] grace it won't really hard any Cuts so
[1:10:34] you know he told me know go ahead sit
[1:10:35] down you know it's the end of the day
[1:10:36] you know we we ain't going to do nothing
[1:10:38] else but go back to the office and clock
[1:10:39] out you know go home so I go over I sit
[1:10:42] down take my shoe off start examining I
[1:10:44] don't feel no broken bones so I was like
[1:10:45] you know just thank you Lord for that
[1:10:47] and so you know he goes he puts the
[1:10:48] equipment away and you know we get to
[1:10:50] going I can tell he's all kind of shook
[1:10:52] up about it cuz you know I'm his
[1:10:53] employee he's the manager you know
[1:10:55] and I get injured on his watch so you
[1:10:57] know he's trying to keep me talking
[1:10:58] telling me you know keep your leg moving
[1:11:00] cuz you don't want it you know stiffing
[1:11:01] up on you and so you know we drive back
[1:11:03] to the office but at that point I made
[1:11:05] up my mind like cuz this wasn't like the
[1:11:07] first injury that happened I was like
[1:11:08] injured but never like nothing serious
[1:11:10] but I'm like you know I can't keep doing
[1:11:12] this at this job so you know I'm going
[1:11:13] to have to move on from this I'm like I
[1:11:15] want to have a conversation with the
[1:11:16] boss when we get back to the office well

[1:30:59] morning I said this dude know I just
[1:31:01] started preaching and know I need some
[1:31:03] time to prepare so y'all pray for me
[1:31:06] Amen on this morning and we going to
[1:31:08] jump straight into the scripture let's
[1:31:10] go to Mark chap 11 and we will go to
[1:31:13] amen verse 23 kind of in the same uh
[1:31:16] theme of what we've been talking about
[1:31:18] this morning amen great
[1:31:20] testimonies uh one of the things I
[1:31:21] appreciate about brother Keith's uh
[1:31:23] message message last night is he he
[1:31:25] touched on things that we sometimes
[1:31:28] forget that the quotes from 47 the all
[1:31:32] of those are are are great but people
[1:31:34] are going through stuff and they need to
[1:31:37] hear these testimonies that God still
[1:31:39] can make ways out of no ways people
[1:31:42] dealing with depression anxiety thinking
[1:31:44] about killing themselves they need to
[1:31:46] know that God is the
[1:31:48] answer amen let's go to Mark 11: 23 and
[1:31:51] it's very familiar passage of scripture
[1:31:54] that we all know very well and Jesus
[1:31:57] starts out here he says for verily I say
[1:31:59] unto you which means listen real
[1:32:02] good that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:32:06] mou now who is whosoever that's
[1:32:07] everybody in this room young uh middle
[1:32:10] age older whosoever shall say to this
[1:32:14] mountain which is personal I know the
[1:32:16] mountain that's in front of you now what
[1:32:18] is that mountain that mountain is
[1:32:20] anything in your life that is that you
[1:32:23] can't move you tried it all and it's
[1:32:25] failed but it's standing in front of you
[1:32:28] and you sang the song like the
[1:32:29] songwriter says Lord if you don't do it
[1:32:32] it just won't get done so whosoever
[1:32:34] shall say to this mountain be thou
[1:32:36] removed and cast into the sea and shall
[1:32:38] not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe
[1:32:41] those things which he saith shall come
[1:32:42] to pass he shall have whatever he saith
[1:32:45] may the Lord have blessing to the
[1:32:46] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:32:48] amen amen you know the prophet of God
[1:32:50] when he he preached the message speak to
[1:32:52] this mountain I than it was um 59 he
[1:32:55] said that uh when he got to this passage
[1:32:57] of scripture he he struggled with this
[1:32:59] because he couldn't really get an
[1:33:01] understanding of Lord you're actually
[1:33:02] saying what I say and it was from the
[1:33:06] perspective he said what if I say
[1:33:07] something wrong and the Spirit came to
[1:33:09] him and said if you anointed to brother
[1:33:10] kei's point last night when you got the
[1:33:12] spirit of God on the inside of you that
[1:33:15] would direct you the right thing to say
[1:33:17] now we we got to understand that to get
[1:33:20] to this point Jesus I only got 10 15
[1:33:23] minutes so I'm trying to paraphrase here
[1:33:24] he gets to this point to where he finds
[1:33:27] this tree and Jesus is hungry and he
[1:33:30] walks up to this this tree and the tree
[1:33:32] is bearing leaves now if you know what a
[1:33:34] fig tree is a fig tree if it Bears
[1:33:36] leaves it should produce figs so he goes
[1:33:38] to this tree and he's hungry and he goes
[1:33:41] to the tree and there's no fruit on this
[1:33:44] tree so he gets upset and he says since
[1:33:46] you're a fake tree since you're a tree
[1:33:49] that's not producing any fruit I curse
[1:33:51] you my since you're a religious tree and
[1:33:55] we see this brother ke talked about it
[1:33:56] last night just because you have the
[1:33:57] quotes from 47 to 56 does not mean you
[1:34:00] got it you got to have something on the
[1:34:02] inside of you you shall know the tree by
[1:34:04] the fruit it bears and not by the leaves
[1:34:08] it bears you can look good you can smell
[1:34:11] good you can have all the quotes but if
[1:34:12] there's no life on the inside of you you
[1:34:15] can speak all you want that mountain
[1:34:17] will stay right
[1:34:19] there people always say Lord I want God
[1:34:22] to pour into me I want God to pour me
[1:34:24] till I overflow have you ever seen
[1:34:26] somebody watering a fake tree you'll
[1:34:29] think they crazy why you watering that
[1:34:31] there's no life there God can only pour
[1:34:34] into something that has life on the
[1:34:36] inside of
[1:34:37] it one of those fruits the Bible tells
[1:34:40] us what those fruits are see the statue
[1:34:41] of a perfect man add to your faith
[1:34:43] virtue to your virtue knowledge you
[1:34:44] can't stop at knowledge there's more to
[1:34:47] add math class ain't over yet you got
[1:34:50] some more adding to do so you just can't
[1:34:52] stay at amen so he says to this tree be
[1:34:55] thou removed and cast to The Sea and
[1:34:57] shall not DOT in his heart but believe
[1:34:59] those things which he shall come come to
[1:35:01] pass he shall have whatever he saith
[1:35:03] amen let's go down let's go back a verse
[1:35:06] here let's go to verse
[1:35:08] 21 good old
[1:35:10] Peter and Peter calling into remembrance
[1:35:13] saith unto him behold Master this fig
[1:35:15] tree without th curses is withered away
[1:35:18] and Jesus gives them the answer or the
[1:35:21] the the cheat sheet if you will of how
[1:35:23] to remove mountains he didn't go into no
[1:35:26] deep back and forth oh I prayed night
[1:35:28] and day I went he said simply have faith
[1:35:32] in in God now that's that that that
[1:35:35] sounds good but you've got to understand
[1:35:37] to have faith in God is three things you
[1:35:38] got to have faith in his word have faith
[1:35:40] in his will and have faith in his way
[1:35:43] yes sir we all know that God is Jehovah
[1:35:45] gy but what if he tells you no come on
[1:35:49] what if he says not yet can you trust
[1:35:51] his will and his way for your life
[1:35:55] if you say God is my Jehovah Gyra and I
[1:35:58] need him to provide and and add
[1:35:59] Financial blessing to me what if his way
[1:36:02] is for you to get fired to teach you how
[1:36:03] to manage your
[1:36:05] finances are you okay with that can you
[1:36:08] still have faith that God is Jehovah
[1:36:10] Gyra see we come to God sometimes and we
[1:36:13] pray Lord I need you to be Jehovah Gyra
[1:36:14] but we have our own way of how we want
[1:36:16] it to happen come on can you trust God's
[1:36:19] word God's will and his way come on
[1:36:24] you know Matthew 17 says you have have
[1:36:26] faith the size of a mustard seed that's
[1:36:28] small if you have faith in God the size
[1:36:31] of a mustard se you can move that
[1:36:32] mountain now some of us and I'm looking
[1:36:34] at my own personal life you can have all
[1:36:37] kinds of faith in your job have all
[1:36:39] kinds of faith in people but they'll
[1:36:41] fail you every time don't matter how
[1:36:43] much if it's the wrong
[1:36:45] Source it'll fail you amen yes sir a lot
[1:36:48] of faith in the wrong thing won't move
[1:36:49] your Mountain but a little faith in the
[1:36:51] right thing can move mountains you know
[1:36:53] yes uh all the testimonies this morning
[1:36:56] were all based off of whether facts
[1:36:59] contradicted the promise on the fact
[1:37:02] said brother Steven should not have had
[1:37:03] a child but God's promise said he was
[1:37:07] sometimes the words that come out of my
[1:37:08] mouth confirm facts and negate God's
[1:37:11] promise we don't confirm facts church we
[1:37:14] are a church that that that walk on
[1:37:16] God's promises the facts will always
[1:37:19] contradict What God
[1:37:21] Says the facts may be yeah you smoked
[1:37:23] weed the facts may say yeah you you
[1:37:26] drank alcohol but God's promise say I
[1:37:28] never lost one the God's promise is I'm
[1:37:31] a savior so don't matter where you are
[1:37:33] in your life don't don't confirm the
[1:37:37] facts the facts may say on your doctors
[1:37:39] report that you have cancer that's not
[1:37:41] God's promise God's promise is I am a
[1:37:45] Healer by his stripes I'm
[1:37:47] Healed the facts may say you got $250 in
[1:37:51] your bank account my God share
[1:37:54] supply all of my needs don't confirm the
[1:37:56] facts church we are believers we don't
[1:37:58] walk by facts we walk by
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:04] faith life is in the power of your own
[1:38:08] tongue in this life facts will always
[1:38:10] contradict what God says but we don't go
[1:38:12] off of facts the facts are accurate but
[1:38:15] God's promises says
[1:38:18] otherwise amen so he says have faith in
[1:38:21] God that is God's word God's Will and
[1:38:23] God's way
[1:38:24] man let's keep moving here amen chapter
[1:38:26] 20 verse 23 we can keep moving it says
[1:38:28] for ver I say unto you whosoever say sa
[1:38:30] to this mountain be thou removed and be
[1:38:32] thou cast into the ceas and not doubt in
[1:38:34] his heart you know in in in the
[1:38:36] prophet's Ministry when God ushered him
[1:38:39] to this the third poort Ministry and we
[1:38:41] all know the story about the squirrels
[1:38:42] those first two squirrels popped up but
[1:38:44] when it got to that third one there was
[1:38:46] a delay come on on now there was a pause
[1:38:50] and he started to question then he went
[1:38:52] back to the scriptures don't doubt in
[1:38:54] your heart just because you don't see it
[1:38:56] don't mean it's not
[1:38:57] there just because you can't feel it
[1:39:00] does not mean it's not
[1:39:03] happening glory to God just because you
[1:39:06] see see sometimes church we got to
[1:39:08] understand that when we worship God in
[1:39:10] spirit and in truth that means negating
[1:39:12] how our emotions feel yes because your
[1:39:15] emotions will not always agree with the
[1:39:17] situation that's true brother your
[1:39:20] feelings would not always agree but
[1:39:21] can't you still say like Jo
[1:39:24] blessed be the name of the Lord that's
[1:39:25] what true worship is anybody can praise
[1:39:27] God when everything's going good amen
[1:39:30] when all is well I can praise God but
[1:39:32] when things don't go your way when you
[1:39:34] don't agree with God's choice can you
[1:39:36] still say Lord I Thank You Lord I bless
[1:39:41] you Bible says in John that he's longing
[1:39:43] for True worshippers and what is worship
[1:39:46] making it always about him and not about
[1:39:48] you that's what worship
[1:39:50] is anybody can praise the Bible says let
[1:39:53] everything that have breath praise the
[1:39:56] Lord but worship is something
[1:40:00] different can can you get on your knees
[1:40:03] and say Lord I don't agree My Flesh
[1:40:04] don't agree but I can still trust
[1:40:08] you that's what Jo was he lost
[1:40:11] everything but the Bible says
[1:40:13] immediately he got on his knees while
[1:40:15] he's crying and he
[1:40:18] worship your feelings and your emotions
[1:40:21] will not always agree with God's way and
[1:40:23] his way but that does not mean you
[1:40:26] should not obli and say Lord I thank you
[1:40:30] anyway glory to God Amen verse 24 he
[1:40:34] says therefore I say unto you what
[1:40:36] things soever you desire when ye pray
[1:40:38] believe that you receive them and ye
[1:40:41] shall what have them now I'm going to
[1:40:44] wrap up with this last thing here and
[1:40:46] this is kind of been the foundation I've
[1:40:48] seen the church that says perfect love
[1:40:50] on that's where we've been at but Jesus
[1:40:52] sums it up in this next p scripture he
[1:40:55] says and when ye stand
[1:40:57] pray come
[1:41:00] on forgive so forgiveness is a condition
[1:41:04] of your Mountain being
[1:41:08] moved that's that's the book that's what
[1:41:10] it says when ye stand praying forgive so
[1:41:14] we getting on our knees and we saying
[1:41:15] Lord I need you to get this mountain out
[1:41:18] my way nobody else can't do it I need
[1:41:20] you and God wants to get to the mountain
[1:41:23] but unforgiveness in our heart we're
[1:41:25] literally playing offensive line God is
[1:41:27] trying to get to the quarterback and we
[1:41:29] blocking them anytime he tries to go
[1:41:31] around we blocking them people have done
[1:41:32] us wrong we still holding on to
[1:41:36] it when you stand praying
[1:41:39] forgive I want to remove this situation
[1:41:42] out your life but you you ain't nothing
[1:41:45] too hard for me but you making it hard
[1:41:48] you waiting on me and I'm waiting on
[1:41:51] you when I saw saw this passage of
[1:41:53] scripture it hit me like a like a brick
[1:41:56] say Lord on my knes I'm praying there
[1:41:58] are things in my life that I need you to
[1:42:00] remove am I the one holding you up
[1:42:03] because I have not went back to people
[1:42:04] that have done me
[1:42:06] wrong listen I I told the church this I
[1:42:09] love everybody I I love my brothers and
[1:42:11] I love my sisters but nobody should be
[1:42:13] more important than your prayers getting
[1:42:15] answered nobody so if if Brother come on
[1:42:18] over here let's have a sit down because
[1:42:21] we need to get this right because I got
[1:42:22] some mountains in my life that I need
[1:42:25] God to move so come on over here let's
[1:42:28] talk let's let's work this thing out
[1:42:30] because you're not more important than
[1:42:32] my prayers getting
[1:42:35] answered so so wrapping this up church
[1:42:38] we all have mountains in our life that
[1:42:40] we need God to move he's a mountain
[1:42:42] moving God he's a miracle working God
[1:42:46] he's a way maker you just got to trust
[1:42:49] him and have faith amen that's all I got
[1:42:51] amen we appreciate our brother Caleb I
[1:42:53] pray for me
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:01] amen amen God is good
[1:43:05] amen man I'm going to go ahead and just
[1:43:07] go straight to the word real quick and
[1:43:10] we'll read from Romans chapter 8 and
[1:43:11] it's a very familiar scripture and I
[1:43:14] think it's in line of what everybody has
[1:43:17] been saying to us today and I I I
[1:43:20] thought this thing came to me last night
[1:43:22] and I was praying
[1:43:23] asking Lord what should I
[1:43:26] say and some came to me and I and I
[1:43:29] wrote it down and said God has not
[1:43:31] forgotten about you that's right God has
[1:43:34] not forgotten about you and every
[1:43:36] testimony today proves that God has not
[1:43:39] forgotten about you every testimony that
[1:43:42] they told where he said I would heal you
[1:43:44] God has not forgotten about you all you
[1:43:46] have to do is brother Maas said have
[1:43:48] faith and you can trust and see what God
[1:43:50] will do and see in Romans chap 8 verse
[1:43:55] 28 when they have it it'll come up and
[1:43:58] it says and we know that all things work
[1:44:01] together for the good to them that love
[1:44:04] God so many of times people quote the
[1:44:06] scripture and they read only part of it
[1:44:08] come on they read the first part and
[1:44:10] said we know that all things work
[1:44:11] together for the good but they forget to
[1:44:14] them that love God see there's a
[1:44:16] requirement to get all the things work
[1:44:18] together to the good it says to them
[1:44:20] that love God to them that are called
[1:44:22] according to to his purpose for whom he
[1:44:24] did for know he also did predestinate
[1:44:27] see God he knew you from the foundation
[1:44:29] of the world he knew you before you Ste
[1:44:32] foot into this world he knew you before
[1:44:34] your father and your grandfather and
[1:44:35] your great-grandfather even was born
[1:44:38] into this world he knew that you was
[1:44:39] going to be here he knew that you was
[1:44:41] going to stand here today and he knew
[1:44:43] that you might have things in your life
[1:44:45] that you need him to work on Amen and
[1:44:47] said I I and you know sometimes you look
[1:44:49] at the minister and you think that
[1:44:51] sometimes he is immune from you
[1:44:53] come on because he's there in the pull
[1:44:55] pit and he says these many things but
[1:44:57] sometime God has to deal with him too
[1:45:00] and God takes him through things to show
[1:45:03] you know to remind them you know that
[1:45:05] you're not too great or you're not too
[1:45:06] Mighty you're not too strong but God has
[1:45:09] a way of allowing you to see that he's
[1:45:11] still real he has a way of showing up
[1:45:14] each and every day when you look up and
[1:45:16] you get up in the morning to show you
[1:45:17] that he's still real and he'll take you
[1:45:20] through things but it's all in allowing
[1:45:22] you to to become stronger in your faith
[1:45:25] it's allowing you to become greater in
[1:45:26] your faith allowing you to get to a
[1:45:29] point that you said Lord I trust you
[1:45:30] more cuz at the end of the day only
[1:45:32] perfect love is going to get there but
[1:45:34] if you can't go through the Small Things
[1:45:36] how can God trust you with the great
[1:45:38] things if you can't go through this
[1:45:40] little trial how can God get you to
[1:45:42] where you want to be but you're asking
[1:45:44] for great things but you don't want to
[1:45:45] go through nothing you don't want to go
[1:45:48] through nothing and realizing that all
[1:45:49] your steps are ordered by him so if he
[1:45:52] allow you to go through it he made a way
[1:45:54] for you to get through it if he put it
[1:45:56] on you he had a way to provide provide a
[1:45:59] way of Escape if he said I would heal
[1:46:01] you maybe he has to give you sickness
[1:46:03] but maybe it's not for you but it's a
[1:46:05] testimony to somebody else to prove that
[1:46:08] he's God it's a testimony to show them
[1:46:10] that all things do work together for the
[1:46:12] good no matter how bad it gets no matter
[1:46:15] how bad it is God is still good and it's
[1:46:18] a way of how you declare of what God is
[1:46:22] some people the only like brother Keys
[1:46:24] was saying last night said the only God
[1:46:26] that they may see is you that's it
[1:46:28] that's why I look at it I say you know
[1:46:29] the greatest testimony that you can have
[1:46:32] you can have all these great testimonies
[1:46:34] but the greatest testimony is the life
[1:46:36] that you live every single day when you
[1:46:38] walk out of the church do what do people
[1:46:41] see what do people say behind your back
[1:46:44] cuz I tell you when when you live a life
[1:46:46] of God you don't even have to say
[1:46:48] nothing when you walk into the room
[1:46:49] people know that you're different people
[1:46:51] know that there's some something
[1:46:53] different about you I've had many
[1:46:55] situations in my life where I didn't say
[1:46:57] anything but people come to me and say
[1:46:58] can you pray for me come on yes sir can
[1:47:02] you pray for me because they knew that
[1:47:04] there was something different you might
[1:47:05] have said I might be a Christian but
[1:47:07] they come to you and ask you for prayer
[1:47:09] come on now I told the story one time I
[1:47:11] was in school and this young lady one of
[1:47:14] my friends that I had and she had this
[1:47:15] exam she had to take and so we came to
[1:47:19] the exam and she said hey can you pray
[1:47:20] for me and she was like I I want to get
[1:47:23] a certain grade so that if I pass this
[1:47:26] and get a certain grade I won't have to
[1:47:27] take the final so I went down and you
[1:47:30] know sometimes we think you know you got
[1:47:31] to say elaborate prayer but it's in the
[1:47:34] scripture that you don't he said the
[1:47:36] Publican I was praying all these little
[1:47:38] things and then this one that came with
[1:47:40] a short still prayer he said that's the
[1:47:42] more sincere prayer that's the one that
[1:47:44] reached heaven and so I came I said Lord
[1:47:47] just allow her to get the grade that she
[1:47:48] needs so she doesn't have to do it I
[1:47:51] don't know why she asked me
[1:47:53] and then we came to it about a week
[1:47:55] later she came back she was excited she
[1:47:58] said I got the grade that I needed and
[1:48:00] it was a testimony to me because I
[1:48:03] realize that when I go to God I can ask
[1:48:05] him and then I can expect something to
[1:48:07] happen it doesn't matter what I ask him
[1:48:10] for if I can go and expect him to have
[1:48:12] it said and it was because of faith that
[1:48:15] I believe that God could do it I came to
[1:48:18] and I believe that God can move I
[1:48:20] believe that God could do it there's
[1:48:22] nothing too hard that my God cannot do
[1:48:24] and see I understood that and it didn't
[1:48:27] matter whether he did it for me maybe
[1:48:28] that was a testimony for them and their
[1:48:30] life to prove that God can do things and
[1:48:34] they can go to them and build that
[1:48:35] relationship for
[1:48:37] themselves but what testimony do you
[1:48:40] have what testimony do you have when you
[1:48:42] walk out of this door you might have a
[1:48:44] wonderful testimony in church come on
[1:48:47] now you might have a wonderful testimony
[1:48:50] when you walk inside these doors but
[1:48:52] what is your testimony when you're late
[1:48:53] at night and you're all alone what is
[1:48:56] your testimony when you're on your job
[1:48:58] what is your testimony when you get
[1:49:00] invited to that event which you knew you
[1:49:02] shouldn't have went to in the first
[1:49:03] place but you showed up just to see who
[1:49:05] was going to be there come on come on
[1:49:07] now what is your testimony because
[1:49:10] listen when you walk out of here nobody
[1:49:12] knows what you may do cuz you might be
[1:49:14] by yourself you might live alone you
[1:49:17] might live far away from a church you
[1:49:19] might live by yourself but who knows
[1:49:21] what is your testimony then do you have
[1:49:24] an acceptable testimony i i i ministered
[1:49:27] one time and I and I titled it are you
[1:49:29] ready for what's
[1:49:32] next when you look at life and you look
[1:49:34] at the even the current events of things
[1:49:37] that's going on in the world are you
[1:49:39] ready on because you never know when
[1:49:42] this moment is your last or when this
[1:49:44] moment they say you know what you can't
[1:49:46] come to church no more you you're not
[1:49:48] allowed to come in these doors where
[1:49:50] where's your testimony going to stand
[1:49:52] there
[1:49:53] where can you turn and say Lord I seen
[1:49:54] you do this and I seen you did this and
[1:49:56] I asked you for this and I've seen you
[1:49:58] do this and now I can't believe for
[1:50:00] greater amen I can believe that I if
[1:50:03] like we had the other day where you seen
[1:50:04] the Cyber attack attack not only the
[1:50:06] airplanes and these things but attack
[1:50:08] the grocery store amen where you
[1:50:10] couldn't go in there and you couldn't
[1:50:11] buy groceries amen because it didn't
[1:50:14] work amen do you have faith enough to
[1:50:16] say Lord I don't have anything but I
[1:50:18] believe that you can provide cuz you
[1:50:21] promised in your word that will supply
[1:50:23] all my needs that's what brother said
[1:50:25] and brother maah said see when these
[1:50:27] things happen you don't know what level
[1:50:29] of Faith you need but there's a faith
[1:50:31] that you're going to need to get up out
[1:50:32] of here so one day when your faith
[1:50:34] increased and you and you have that love
[1:50:37] in your heart and that Faith increase
[1:50:38] you can get up out of here you can
[1:50:40] translate and you can move on to what
[1:50:42] God has for you cuz it's all in his word
[1:50:45] thank you Lord there wasn't nothing
[1:50:47] that's not covered in his word amen no
[1:50:49] matter how difficult it is no matter how
[1:50:52] bad it may seem no matter how worse it
[1:50:54] may get there's nothing that's not
[1:50:56] covered in there where you can't open
[1:50:58] your Bible you can't read it and God
[1:51:00] can't speak to you said if you want to
[1:51:02] get closer to God the prophet of God
[1:51:04] said it he said all you had to do is
[1:51:06] read your Bible and pray Lord cuz I
[1:51:09] believe if you get on your knees many of
[1:51:11] times you may go to God and we can all
[1:51:13] be guilty of this where you go and you
[1:51:15] ask and you ask and you ask but do you
[1:51:17] ever
[1:51:18] listen that's it that's it come on do
[1:51:21] you ever sit down and and not only talk
[1:51:23] to God but have a conversation with god
[1:51:26] where you sit down and you recognize
[1:51:28] that when you're sitting down and you're
[1:51:30] praying and you talking to God and you
[1:51:32] hear that voice that's not your parents
[1:51:36] that's not you thinking but it's God
[1:51:38] speaking to you cuz I promise if you
[1:51:40] want to hear him he will speak to you
[1:51:42] amen and I no this for myself and that
[1:51:45] you you sometimes you need those
[1:51:47] personal experiences with God you need
[1:51:51] you need those things that you can't
[1:51:52] tell
[1:51:54] nobody but you need God to work them out
[1:51:57] amen and you might not can't go to
[1:51:59] friend family or nobody but you say Lord
[1:52:01] there's a need in my life there's a need
[1:52:04] in my life Lord I don't know what your
[1:52:07] need may be but I know that Jesus can
[1:52:10] supply all your needs I don't know what
[1:52:13] you may go through but I can tell you
[1:52:14] he's a deliver he's a provider he's a
[1:52:17] keeper if you want to be
[1:52:19] kept but see first of all you got to
[1:52:22] come to and lay it all down it does you
[1:52:25] no good to to come to God give it to him
[1:52:28] and and once you step away pick it back
[1:52:31] up that that shows God that you don't
[1:52:33] really trust him when all that he
[1:52:36] requires you to do is to trust him
[1:52:38] brother I said but we know that all
[1:52:40] things work together to The Good the
[1:52:43] them that love him amen so many of us we
[1:52:46] may come to Crossroads in life where you
[1:52:48] have to make a choice amen and you don't
[1:52:51] know
[1:52:53] sometimes it's all in what choice you
[1:52:55] make how the rest of your life can end
[1:52:57] up now God has grace and mercy and you
[1:53:00] can hear testimonies of where God has
[1:53:02] brought it you from but some of you
[1:53:04] don't have to make the choice to be out
[1:53:06] there I said sometimes I said many
[1:53:08] people want to do this and they have
[1:53:10] these great testimonies I said you know
[1:53:12] it's a more powerful testimony to be in
[1:53:14] church and stay in church oh brother and
[1:53:16] have and have a relationship with God
[1:53:19] that people know that you have a
[1:53:20] relationship with God and believe that
[1:53:22] God is able to do exceedingly abant
[1:53:24] abant more than you can ask or think
[1:53:26] because God is real amen and the devil
[1:53:30] is real and if you don't believe it all
[1:53:32] you have to do is go outside and just
[1:53:34] look and You' realize that this is a
[1:53:37] more blessed life this is a better life
[1:53:40] to live and there's testimonies to show
[1:53:42] you that God is good and he allows you
[1:53:45] there's a reason why you see Brothers
[1:53:47] like brother Jos tell you to stay cuz
[1:53:49] they've experienced it and God has
[1:53:51] blessed them to come back amen but if
[1:53:53] you don't have to experience it why
[1:53:55] would you I I tell people all the time
[1:53:57] there's some lessons in life I don't
[1:53:59] have to learn from myself I can just
[1:54:02] look and listen to what somebody told me
[1:54:04] and realize that that's the truth and I
[1:54:05] don't have to follow that
[1:54:07] path you don't have to go down certain
[1:54:10] Pathways cuz you don't realize some of
[1:54:12] the scars that may come with those paths
[1:54:15] you don't realize some of the thoughts
[1:54:16] that may come with those paths some of
[1:54:18] the memories that the devil will bring
[1:54:20] up to you in your mind when you all
[1:54:22] alone because he know that's your
[1:54:24] weakest
[1:54:25] point where you have to believe God even
[1:54:28] stronger to even make it through those
[1:54:30] moments there are things that people
[1:54:32] tell you that testimonies because God is
[1:54:34] trying to warn you trying to keep you
[1:54:37] but it's all as if you want to be kept
[1:54:39] amen so today I implore you to come to
[1:54:43] him if you have not given your life to
[1:54:45] Christ today is the opportunity today is
[1:54:48] the day to make a change in your life
[1:54:50] that you can go forward and say Lord I
[1:54:52] don't I've done a lot of things but
[1:54:55] today I
[1:54:56] Surrender see it comes to you that you
[1:54:58] have to give it up all amen you can't
[1:55:00] just give a part of it and keep part God
[1:55:03] wants all of your heart and when you
[1:55:06] give them all I guarantee you I
[1:55:08] guarantee you the things that you are
[1:55:11] afraid of God will keep you from them
[1:55:13] the things that you are scared of God
[1:55:15] will keep you God will guide you God
[1:55:18] will lead you he will allow you to
[1:55:20] overcome them if you give it all to
[1:55:23] it's not just a piece of it it's not
[1:55:24] just a part of it God will do all that
[1:55:27] he promised he would do but you got to
[1:55:29] give him all of it not just a piece of
[1:55:31] it it's not just good to come to church
[1:55:34] on it's not just good to be a faithful
[1:55:36] member God wants to do more than that
[1:55:39] God wants you to finally come to him and
[1:55:41] say Lord I give it up hard and I
[1:55:44] guarantee you if you give it up people I
[1:55:46] say all the time people think it's hard
[1:55:48] to get the Holy Ghost oh brother I said
[1:55:51] no it's not all you have to do is empty
[1:55:54] everything out sometimes your dreams
[1:55:57] sometimes your desires sometimes these
[1:56:00] things that you got farfetched of what
[1:56:02] you want to be and how you want to be it
[1:56:04] but if you come to God and you give it
[1:56:06] up everything and you and you said Lord
[1:56:09] I want you to take everything cuz he
[1:56:12] wants an empty vessel he don't want
[1:56:14] something with something is still there
[1:56:16] but you come to him and say Lord I give
[1:56:18] you up everything I guarantee you he
[1:56:21] will fill you
[1:56:22] I guarantee you your life will be
[1:56:24] changed I guarantee you that God will do
[1:56:26] something that you will not describe a
[1:56:28] no man know but others will know that
[1:56:31] God has changed me God Has Changed Me
[1:56:34] and God has done the work it's not
[1:56:36] anything that I could do but it's what
[1:56:38] he's done for
[1:56:39] me see that's what you got to get to but
[1:56:43] it's all in whether you want it or not
[1:56:45] it's all in whether you want to give it
[1:56:47] up or not it's whether you want to give
[1:56:49] up that person that you've been looking
[1:56:51] at it's whether you want to give up
[1:56:54] those things that you desire in your
[1:56:56] heart cuz only God knows the desires of
[1:56:58] your
[1:56:59] heart but he wants to come and he wants
[1:57:01] to fill you this morning he wants you to
[1:57:04] give your life to him this morning that
