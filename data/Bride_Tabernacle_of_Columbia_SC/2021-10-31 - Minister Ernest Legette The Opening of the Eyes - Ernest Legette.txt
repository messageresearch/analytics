believe that this morning amen i thank god for the songs and his grace giving us to we can be back in his house one more time amen you know things are happening so fast and i was telling uh somebody uh i think it was the pastor i was talking with him friday night i was saying you know life is so short isn't it i was thinking about my cousin that passed away right before we come to church friday night i said man life is so short you know she was the one that did our decorations at the wedding and i didn't even know she had fallen sick about a week or two ago but they called and everybody in the families heard said she passed away so i i said man that hit me so hard i said man life is so short i says you know i started thinking to myself for that little song i'm living this life so i can live again because if we put everything in this life come on it's so short it's full of sorrows a man that's born of a woman is what a few days come on and ain't that saying to be the truth a few days and what full of trouble but nevertheless he said i go away to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also so i don't know about you i was just thinking on that way listen to hearing that about my cousin i said you know i i don't i'm not living this life to be here like that come on i said i thank god for his grace you know it's so many people that wanted to be in church this morning but couldn't make it whether whether they've been bound by something or whatever it might have been there's so many people that wanted to be here but couldn't make it so many people that want to worship god but they can't come on so just considering how short life is and and considering the grace that god has given us come on to be able to praise him one more time come on i say what we do we take full advantage of that opportunity we ain't gonna let it cease from our mouth to say thank you lord for all of your blessings toward us thank you lord for all of your grace and your mercy thank you lord for life health and strength thank you lord for blessing my family god blessing everybody around me lord thank you lord i ain't gonna let that cease from out of my mouth lord i thank you for one more time lord they sing that song one more time come on you didn't come here on your own but he allowed you come on he allowed us to come together somebody said i just came no he allowed you to come come on he allowed us to come together one more time i was telling uh a stinking brother charles the other night i was telling him i was saying you know sometimes people say where they could have been but i always say where i should have been because of the life that i lived and because of the things that where god has brought me from i don't i don't say where i could have been i say where i should have been but the blood of jesus hallelujah and what he did for me on calvary washed away all of my sins hallelujah all things have become new so where i know where i should have been if it wasn't i like that song for the mercy of the good lord hallelujah [Music] i said god is a good god yes he is hallelujah if it wasn't for the mercy of what the good lord i wouldn't be here today come on i know i wouldn't be here today god is good do you believe that somebody give god come praise let us bow our heads in the word of prayer you have a special need you can make it known by the lifting of your hands heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace lord and your mercy o lord truly god we come to you today lord with grateful hearts lord god because of your faithfulness and god the things that you do for us over and over again somebody said that he keep on doing great things for me and lord i thank you for it lord are we deserving most of the time we aren't but nevertheless god you look past all our faults beyond all those and you see our needs god thank you for meeting our needs thank you for looking beyond our faults god i pray just now lord by the holy ghost that god you would meet each and every need lord the hands that were lifted the hearts that were raised god that you'll bless your children god there's so many needs oh we are living in a needy hour oh god how we need you every day every hour lord we need you god we can't never get away from that because the darker the night gets god we can't find our way but you promised oh god to be a light oh god to our path light our path up this morning show us the way for god we need you right now lord we thank you pray you bless the pastor lord as he down as something lord god i pray that the holy ghost might fall in the midst of your children oh god and give them what they stand in need of oh god there's so many that are in need oh god i believe in your word you said that the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few but god i pray this morning you'll send labors to the vineyard oh god to help harvest the crop lord we thank you today god we ask if we said or done anything that ain't like you that you will forgive us just now you would help us god move out of the way and be reconciled unto you father for we love you thank you jesus in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen we want to look at the book of luke by god's grace luke 24 very familiar scripture we'll begin at the 13th verse you feel all right this morning we're trying not to hold you long amen luke 24 and 13. she got it say amen and it reads and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad and one of them whose name is cleopas answers saying unto him are thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him unto death and have crucified him but we have trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the south unite and when they found nada's body they came saying that that they had also seen a vision of angels which said he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the subculture and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw not then said then he said unto them old fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew now into the village wherewith they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to terror with them and it came and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he take bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to up to us the scriptures may god bless to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning just for a moment i want to minister to you on a topic and i entitled it the opening of the eyes amen the opening of the eyes now we're seeing here a very familiar scripture of you know what is taking place but you know a lot of things in that day had taken place but the the the disciples are here walking the road to emmaus to the two that walk in the road to emmaus they were they weren't able to to uh comprehend what had just taken place come on so that's what we said the opening of the eyes a lot of times we could see things but we didn't comprehend what we just saw and so and that's what the the the issue was not only with the church world of that day but the issue is is the same with the church world today we can look back as the prophet god talked about we can look back and see what god has done or what god is going to do but we can always miss what he's doing right now so i appreciate that song that lord whatever you're doing in this season don't do it without me come on so i want to talk about the opening of the eyes it's something here how you know like it says here in the scriptures the men they were sad and they were sad because of what had happened come on and now see how you know jesus they were thinking about those things which had taken place and as they were pondering on those things then that's when jesus showed up do you believe that this morning so you know a lot of times you know as he said that a lot of times christ don't come near because we got our mind on everything else we're thinking about everything else but him but when you get your mind on jesus sometimes we worry we have word about uh why we're going through these things and while we're going through those things and it calls us to have those restless nights but i believe that it's something about the mind come on you got to get your mind on him now cause he said the mind that's on him he'll still keep at what perfect peace why how could he keep you at perfect peace because when your mind is on him that's when he'll show up come on lord i'm like they say lord i'm dependent on you to see us through come on in the midst of all of what you're going through now keep your mind on god in the midst of all the waves and the wind being busterous keep your mind on him now come on and everything will be all right do you believe that this morning so we find that it says that they were pondering on these things but you know as they pondering on these things and all of a sudden jesus show up come on and jesus began to ask them he said why are you walking and you know paraphrasing it being so sad come on and they begin to say to him well are you a stranger you don't know what happened come on the one that we had our faith in that we thought to be the messiah the one who we trusted in he don't let us down come on not only they said that he let us down but you know he told us that he would rise again and even though people came and testified that just what he said it came to pass that we seen him come on we went to where they laid him and he ain't there no more come on not only that but we seen angels come on not only did we see angels but we saw him come on he's alive and well come on but yet even though the people come to them to testify that just what he said he'll do he did it they still didn't believe it come on because they were walking and they were what sad i thought about that even today no matter how much somebody testified to you come on to tell you that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah still when you're going through your time hallelujah when you're going through your period of doubting worriation hallelujah your trial and your tribulation hallelujah sometimes we still don't want to believe the report do you believe that this morning come on but we find that i said that you know they were walking they were sad but i said if they only knew hallelujah what had just taken place if they only knew the victory that was won what looked like was a defeat it was actually a victory wasn't it come on and how many times i thought about it just going down the other day in in the road and i said sometimes a lot of things happen to us that look like defeat but you give god some time come on let god have his way just a little while now it might have looked like a defeat but in the end when you look back at it you said that god meant it for my good you look at all those weapons that was formed against you and then you could say none of them didn't prosper hallelujah oh jesus do you believe that come on but they were worried about it wasn't he come on walking because it looked like it was a defeat they said this this great man this mighty prophet who we trusted and believe come on i could see how some of them may have went back in their minds hallelujah and say all of the mighty works that he done how he walked on water how he broke the bread and fed 5 000. how he raised lazarus from the dead hallelujah how when the people had so much faith once and they took the roof off of a man's house and laid the man down on a cot how he looked at that man and he said take up that bed and walk oh this mighty man went down in the they feet on but they didn't understand that he didn't go down and defeat this mighty man that that we saw do all these great things and how he let those soldiers whip him how he let him pull the hair out of his face come on how he let him spit on him talk to him like he was nothing hallelujah he went down in defeat looked like but what jesus began to show on that hey you were looking at it but you didn't understand what you were seeing come on you didn't understand isaiah 53 hallelujah who has believed our reporting whom is the arm of the lord revealed it was power in what they were looking at hallelujah oh jesus come on in weakness that's when god is strong when i'm weak that's when he's strong you might be looking at my weaknesses hallelujah but when i get all i can do when i give up trying hallelujah and i'm just going to stand that's when my strength comes because he is my strength i don't know about you but i always say like this when situations hit i got this little thing i say to myself i said i know what i'ma do i'm gonna trust god hallelujah i say you know what i know what i'm gonna do i'ma wait on guard you know what i'm gonna do i'mma praise god hallelujah why because i know where my help come from oh jesus do you know where your help come from this morning i said but it's the opening of the eyes they were seeing they were seeing these things and and they didn't know what they were what they were seeing come on they couldn't recognize it and that's why jesus when he stepped out he began to say to him he said why are you so sad folk come on he says have not christ suffered these things come on and rise again on the third day you don't know what you're looking at let me let me open your eyes a little bit hallelujah and that's what the holy ghost even has to do in our lives today come on when you going through come on when the enemy has come in like a flood sometimes the holy ghost got to come in the room and say hey don't you know what you're looking at why are you sitting in the corner so sad don't you understand what's taking place the enemy is coming like a flood now the angels of god are here hallelujah to do what lift up the standard do you believe that hallelujah oh i believe that with all of my heart it never felt failed one time when the enemy came rushing in god didn't swoop down to the rescue god didn't take me by the hand and lead me on hallelujah do you believe that oh jesus come on that ought to do something to your heart don't you know god is bringing you through stages come on what you going through right now is just a stage to get you where you got to go next i said what the devil cast as a stumbling block god use it to make a stepping stone for you come on all you're doing is doing what's stepping a little bit higher come on when we talk about stepping stone what are you doing building your stairway i believe that onto eternity hallelujah we ain't going down but we going up do you believe that every round go higher and higher until one day god i believe will come down and swoop us up and take us away from here hallelujah oh jesus i believe that come on i was listening to that song last night on the other shore come on say no more sorrows no more weeping all of our troubles we'll be gone aren't you longing for that day hallelujah cause we're living in a world of trouble sometimes you're afraid to answer the phone because you don't know what's gonna happen next but nevertheless it'll be a day when all the tears will be wiped from your eyes all of the trouble will be gone and what we'll be living with the lord and joy forevermore do you believe that hallelujah but i said the opening of the eyes sometimes how it says you know a lot of what looked like a defeat was actually a victory wasn't it what god what jesus was doing here at calvary what was he doing restoring things hallelujah from where man had fallen if they could only see what was taking place on calvary even even the devil didn't know it he said if had he known he wouldn't have crucified him ain't it had he known that he was gonna rise like we was preaching with all power come on he said all power has given unto me in heaven and earth had the devil known it he would have never crucified him wouldn't he but to be able to look at and see have your eyes open to what calvary was doing i see those saints of old like they talk about elijah elijah and elijah and all of those can say that's what we testified about that's who we've been waiting on the savior to come hallelujah so what did calvary do calvary wasn't a defeat but calvary was a victory we looked at calvary as a victory victory over the enemy victory for our healing victory for our deliverance victory for our peace it was all wrapped up in calvary hallelujah that was the greatest victory ever wrote ain't it come on my savior come on my king of kings and my lord of lords here he is hallelujah when the devil had grip on your life when he had rights come on against your life and he can sometimes do what he wants but nevertheless now the blood is about to be said hallelujah and when the blood is said you can apply that blood over your life and the devil don't have no right hallelujah to come in your home he don't have no right to touch your body hallelujah why because the blood has been applied oh jesus and there's power wonder working power in that blood that was said that blood's got so much wonder work and power it can wash away your sins when you stand before god and then the devil is accusing you he don't even see it why because of the blood that was said hallelujah oh jesus one of my favorite scriptures ephesians 4 how you know it says that we in all in times past walk according to the course of this sinful flesh and all these things just paraphrasing it he said we walk that way but then he goes on a little bit further to say but god hallelujah come on but god hallelujah who was rich in mercy oh yes i was a sinner once but god hallelujah and not only that i came to him just like i was hallelujah weary wounded oh my god it's sad but i found in him a resting place oh yes but god he was rich in mercy oh jesus you know that's what it is the devil have people bound you try to convince them all you got to do is give your life to god all you got to do is come to him and say lord come on save me i don't know sometimes you don't know what to say i said lord help me because i'm afraid of myself and i don't know what i'm capable of god i need your help and here comes jesus hallelujah coming to the rescue here come the savior carrying a cross hallelujah and he says follow me and i'll make you hallelujah i'm gonna change he said follow me and i'm gonna make you hallelujah i said make me god change me make me over again hallelujah i'm stirred you know why because the devil can't do nothing with it come on you know the devil can't do nothing with jesus come on he can't do nothing with him do you believe that come on i said but what it is god got to show us the opening of the eyes he began to he began hearing the scriptures come on talking those disciples and and then he began breaking down the bible says he beginning at moses began breaking down the scriptures to him didn't he come on doing things and i like how it says did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us come on and as he opened the scriptures did not our heart burn within us you know what's happening today i always pray i said lord even for our minister don't let it just be me get up talking lord but we need your spirit to come to do what opened the scriptures because when the scriptures are opened by the holy ghost that's when the people's hearts will begin to burn and when the people's hearts are beginning to burn what is it doing burning out i believe all impurities burning out everything that's not like him setting it right that the master can come i said lord let the people heart burn let my heart burn god let it burn hallelujah amen oh jesus somebody ought to praise god come on somebody out to praise him like you know what he done for you hallelujah like you know where he brought you from oh god i said what it is the opening of the eyes that says how many times in our life you think about it that you had situations even may have a situation right now come on that you're dealing with but you don't understand who's backing you god got to open your eyes you know i like how i believe was elisha you know standing on the side of the mountain and all the syrian armies were doing what and camped around them wasn't it come on but i believe it was hazel began to worry and didn't he scared and afraid but elisha he wasn't worried come on what he said lord open his man eyes come on i'm talking about the opening of the eyes this morning open his eyes that he might see that it's more with us come on that the god we serve is greater than the trial we face that the god we serve he don't whip the devil come on oh from every angle that was god's masterpiece he don't handle all those situations hallelujah but for the foundation of the world it was already done come on that's what's the singer so it's already done hallelujah the victory is won the battle is over and it's already done do you believe that this morning hallelujah but he began to tell us he said open his mad eyes but when his eyes were open what did he see all of the hosts of the lord hallelujah he camped about him chariots of fire hallelujah come to do what battle hallelujah god come into battle i said you know what it is i thank god he's my battle axe hallelujah god god is my warrior you don't you know in the middle of the night when the devil's trying to devise a way to destroy you don't you know god is battling he got he got the angels of god what the host of god battling when god show up he ain't come to just play with the devil but he called the battle hallelujah did you believe that this morning i thank god for that i said he come to battle come on that's i was sharing with the church last sunday and something i said you know you don't you don't understand sometimes you know what be taking place in the middle of the night you lay down to drift off to sleep and you don't understand the angels watching over you you don't understand they battle it for you all night when you when you ain't conscious to call on the name of the lord yourself they got your back come on they keeping a hedge about you i said if you only knew if god could allow us to tap into hallelujah when that and that man was getting ready to pull out in front of you hallelujah and you would have lost your life if god could only let us tap into the angels of god were there doing what battling if god could only let you tap into when your appendix might erupt if god would only let you tap into when that heart attack was waiting on you hallelujah but what it is the angels of god were battling hallelujah god would only let you tap into hallelujah the robbery and the thieves and stray bullets that was flying around how the angels the spirit of god just guided all these things out of the way if he would only let you tap into it hallelujah god do you believe that this morning like i said open the opening of the eyes come on and what happens many times you know the private guy says something i want to i want to i want to read you something i looked it up he was saying about the uh word worrying has no value come on worriation has no value only thing it does is bring bad things on you come on but faith has all the value so i began to look at variation versus faith come on but i said worriation i looked up to see what the medical field was saying about worriation they were saying worrying is feeling uneasy or being overly concerned about a situation or a problem say with excess and worry in your mind and your body going overdrive as you constantly focus on what might happen hallelujah come on it ain't happening yet you just constantly focusing on what might happen hallelujah come on i believe in the scriptures it said the thing i feared is what came upon me didn't he come on job worried about what might happen hallelujah but what it is it says that in the midst of excessive worrying you may suffer with high anxiety even panic during during waking hours it says many chronic warriors tell of a feeling of a sense of impending doom impending doom or unrealistic fears come on many warriors they they got impending doom that's what they thinking about it or unrealistic come on fears ain't even realistic but worrisome will make it realistic it ain't even likely to happen but variation brought it to you come on that's what it did it materialized it for you come on says that only increase their worries ultra sensitive to the environment and to the criticism of others come on worriation to make you uh worry about the criticism of others instead of keeping your mind on christ come on the only righteous judge the only one that can say yea or nay come on keep your mind on him sometimes we like to say don't worry about what everybody else is thinking what everybody else saying about the situation what did jesus say about it because his vote is the only vote that matters come on his vote is the only vote that counts but when you're worried about it you're worried about what everybody else saying hallelujah but as long as he's all right with it i'm fine with it too do you believe that this morning come on it says criticism of other excessive worries warriors may see anything come on you may see anything or see anyone as a potential threat come on i say worriation it does what it has no value does it but fear i mean but faith what does faith do come on faith brings the impossible possible faith says though all the odds is against me yet lord i still believe because of what your word said it was somebody that's going to have faith come on that and when jesus died they still went to the tomb to anoint his body but it was somebody that was going to have faith to say did not he say that after three days he gonna rise again and i believe what he said do you believe that come on what does worrying do tell you how your body feel and all these things worrying believes in your doctor's report and brings unrealistic things to you but what does faith do hallelujah faith says with his stripes i am healed hallelujah faith says i'm more than a conqueror hallelujah through what christ jesus that gives me strength that's what faith says do you believe that this morning but what it is the opening of the eyes but what he had to he had to come to them come on and it's something i like how he says as he opened to us the scriptures he had to come to them begin opening up the scriptures not only opening up the scriptures but showing them come on in the word the holy ghost had to show him come on same as it did then in the opening of the eyes the holy ghost has to open our eyes today to show us that we're not we're not defeated come on but god we're still in god's holy plan we're still in god's mind he knows exactly where he got us at come on but what it is it ain't it ain't in sin what's around us but god open our spiritual eyes do you believe that this morning but we find that i says that you know a lot of times a lot of times we when i say the opening of the eyes we can believe those things that we see natural but remember faith is the evidence of the things not seen come on faith i mean faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report that by faith through faith what the worlds were framed talked about how you know the things that we don't see those are the real things but the things that we do see those are the things that fade away so the things that we see were made by the things that do not what appear that we can't see so what it is when i say the opening of the eyes what what am i talking about not of your natural eyes come on but the opening of the spiritual eyes the eyes of faith that i can begin looking to the unseen i can begin looking into a realm that nobody else don't know about that when the rest of the world is looking here in the natural yet we're looking through the eyes of faith we know that we are more than conquerors we know that we're overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony oh but everything is against what you're saying nevertheless i know hallelujah that my redeemer lived and in the last day he'll stand on the earth i'll say it like this he'll call my name one day i'll answer and that's what i'm living this life for hallelujah hear my name call one day hallelujah do you believe that this morning but i said the opening of the eyes come on taking taking a guard opening your eyes to to see and when you know their whole i can see that their whole continents changed their whole attitude changed about the situation when their eyes were open the bible says and when their eyes were open they knew him they didn't even know who he was until their eyes were open and then he vanished out that sight but the joy that he left him with not only the joy they left him with but he left them with open eyes now they can go out and testify hallelujah that he is risen that he is the same yesterday today and forever what does god open your eyes for today so you can go out and testify god didn't just heal you so you won't have to tell nobody but he wants you to go out and testify that the same god that heal me he can heal you too oh i believe it do you believe that what i say is what it is if we ever i didn't want to be long this morning if we ever uh needed it had an hour that we needed our eyes to be open now is the hour if it ever was a a place in time when you didn't want to miss your day of visitation now it's that day come on like i said you can look back and look forward but commits what god is doing you don't want to miss what god is doing right now what are we anticipating the coming of the rapture what are we anticipating god one day call in the dead in christ they'll rise first and we which alive and remain shall what meet them in the air and forever go on to be with the lord you don't want to miss this day so if you ever wanted your eyes to be open lord open my eyes right now put me in tune with the spirit that i can see what you're doing right now lord hallelujah you know in this age it was saying that it'd be blind miserable naked didn't it come on and not even know it going about these things in revelation 3 18 he says but i counsel of thee to buy me gold what tried in the fire hallelujah come on god wants to try it in the fire god gonna take you through some things but nevertheless it's gold bought by god he brought me through this he'll bring me through that come on i've been through the fire and the flood and all those things but nevertheless it's the blood of jesus come on but what it is he says i counsel of thee buy me gold tried in the fire come on in a white and a and a white raiment come on that you may be close god don't want you to be naked hallelujah but not only that he didn't leave it there he said but i said hallelujah that i can anoint that you can anoint your eyes your eyes can be anointed so what you can see what's all around you you can see the the midst of all this you were able to see like i said when when those brothers when their eyes were open it changed their whole continents changed the whole way they're looking at things and when the people eyes are open today what does it do it brings about a change do you believe that when your eyes are open today it brings about a change and that's what we want i said lord come on i was saying the other week that you can tell somebody something a thousand times and they ain't heard you come on but when god began to deal with them when god began to do something now and their hearts begin to turn then they come back to you and say i never saw it that way come on but what i never they may even say i never heard it like that come on but what it was it took god to do it didn't it it took god to begin dealing with that individual turning them around and i want to say god can deal with anybody do you believe that this morning i seen where some of my friends like a friend of mine uh now that the lord saved him but i said what it is i said to look at the life that he came from look at my other friend brother damon the life that he walked through walk from look at myself i said what it is we might have heard uh from the preacher we might have heard it year in and year out but one day when god stepped in hallelujah one day when god began to speak our hearts begin to turn and that what made the difference our eyes begin to open and it begin to burn within us i said let that happen right here let that happen right now may somebody's heart begin to burn may somebody's heart begin to turn god open their eyes do you want that this morning come on do you want that of your family do you want that of your friends i was telling pastor simmons the other day i said you know sometimes your heart burden because you say lord could i have done more to reach out to family reach out to those but then you know it's a scripture says god knows them never hears come on but nevertheless we ain't going to be lazy we're still going to do all we can do come on to do what strive that somebody could see the gospel somebody's eyes can be open we pray lord open their eyes god break the word down to them lord god begin doing something in their heart hallelujah that they can begin to turn and then when he does all it is he done the plant and all we're doing is just watering come on he oh we doing it he doing that it don't take one but it it it's god using whomever he will to do what get the job done do you believe that this morning and i believe that with all of my heart let us stand is good amen i said the opening of the eyes come on when their eyes were open then they knew them in a moment things changed for them didn't it come on i don't know what you faced with today i don't know what kind of variation the heartache of pain you might be going through but when your eyes is open and you know him and you know that it's him it's jesus come on jesus is here when your eyes is open and you know that the master is in the shield when your eyes is open says he says fear not a little flock come on when your eyes are open then you know he's been in your corner the whole time when your eyes are open and you see the host of the lord and kept all about you like we said ready to do what ready to go to battle when your eyes are open you might come in to church a new person and they say what happened is the situation over no but i'm just praising it in the midst of it because i already know that the victory has already won now my eyes is open now that god is in control of this situation come on i believe david said the lord is the strength of my life and whom shall i be afraid come on didn't he say that come on the lord is my light my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life who shall i be afraid come on everybody else is worried about all this about him but he said the bible said david encouraged himself in the lord why because he had an opening of the eyes he understood that many of they said that rise up against me many are they that say of my soul that there's no help for him in god but thou lord hallelujah you are sealed for me my glory and the lifter of my head i'm walking with my head lifted up i'm walking in power i'm walking in authority why because i know where my help comes from hallelujah what it is the opening of the eyes open their eyes lord open his heart lord open his eyes lord that they might see we don't have nothing to be worried about we don't have nothing to be feared about let's praise the lord and go on let's praise the lord and go hallelujah i said praise the lord and go on do you feel like praising them and going on this morning come on come on do you feel like it oh yeah why they say i feel like traveling though do you feel like traveling all do you feel like going off hallelujah let us bow jesus the opening of the eyes when their eyes were open the situation changed come on somebody need their eyes open just now that the situation can change god won't change it for you he said behold i make all things new come on somebody give it to god right now you see what variation does come on it don't hold no value it only brings you down worse than where you started but what does faith do faith lifts you out
