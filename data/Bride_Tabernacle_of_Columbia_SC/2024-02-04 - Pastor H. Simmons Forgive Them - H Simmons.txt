Word of Promise Lord that you look upon the needs of the hands that have been lifted the hearts of the Open Lord all the many special requests Lord especially this morning we ask you to look upon the English family this morning uh brother Ernest as he ministers funeral service this afternoon father I ask you oh God to comfort hearts Lord I pray God that you would move here this this morning meet the needs of every individual those that are present and those that are listening in Lord God may you oh God touch heal and deliver Lord those that have need of Salvation may you save those that have need of the Holy Ghost may you feel them for whatever it is that we standing in need of you know Lord forgive us oh God and move flesh back out of the way that the spirit might have preeminence your word might oh God be fulfilled in our lives in Jesus name amen the book of St Luke 23 we we're just ministering the series The Devil didn't know and do you know but this morning forgive them as you turn I just read the 32nd verse it and there were also two others male factors led with him to be put to death the 33 says and when they were come to a place which is called what Calvary there they what the prophet of God in in indictment says There They Crucified him amen and the male factors one on the right hand and the other on the left then said Jesus father what for them Father forgive them for they what they and they departed his garments and cast lots amen God bless you may be seated now if you were an onlooker and you were there I wonder what would your response be did they actually know what they were doing did they actually un did they understand the magnitude of what was going on for it was prophesized they cast lots what they were doing they were fulfilling scripture unconsciously and unaware they were doing what the word had said that they would do our lives were're not here just by coincidence we have a purpose and God allowed us to be born in this world it's a reason why God alive for he said he made some vessels to honor and some to dishonor but those vessels to honor you have a purpose some would be sheep and others would be goat some would be wheat and others would be tear are you with me some will be saved and some will refuse to accept salvation some would be lost but God and every individual gives you an opportunity to make a choice and the choice that we make today may be the only time that you would be able to make that choice then again you might have a second time a third time but one day you'll face a righteous Jud judge and when you face him I believe that we'll be without excuse so the choice and the decision that you make let's make the right decision There They Crucified him he chose to forgive them and forgive forgiveness signifies remission of The Punishment Due to the sinful conduct so glad that he forgave me are you glad he forgave you but some even though he forgave them they would not accept it's up to you to receive forgiveness for he has already forgiven you he's already said you are forgiven but if you don't want it then you would not have it father forgive them because they do not understand what they are doing often times when we were coming through life we made many choices that wasn't good we did many things that we ashamed of today we're ashamed of some of the decisions we made some of the things we did and we don't want to we don't have an opportunity to go back and correct those things but isn't it good that we have a God that says I forgive you I forgive you in spite of your bad decisions some of the foolish stuff we did God still says I love love you I forgive you I'm so glad now forgive them 1 Corinthians again two and we want to just take our time and look at it and uh just think about his goodness think about his love think about how much he cared for us when we made bad decisions yet he still had mercy he still loved us he could have just when you made your first wrong decision he could have cut you off right then when you chose to go the wrong way he could have said it's all over now yet he still says I'm patient I'm longsuffering amen knowing that it's appointed time that you would come to yourself you would recognize how much he cared the young man went away from home and he says in the hog pin he says how many high serons that my father have you know what I'm saying I I I could be in better shape than I'm in now but one thing he acknowledged he acknowledged that I got a father and one thing you can recognize that I got a God yes I got a father that I can go to I don't have to be in the condition that I'm in I can go home you see that man young man came to himself and he wanted to go back home for what I was what I left not knowing that I was going to get myself in this condition if he would only known that he was leaving the word to go after the world if he only knew what he was doing but he said father forgive them CU they don't understand what they doing are you with me so in um 1 Corinthians 2 here and five he said and your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the what in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are what are you with me y'all know who you talking to right so he's speaking wisdom to them that are are you he's speaking wisdom to them that are perfect I said the devil didn't know but do you know that God is saying I speak in wisdom to them that are perfect the Corinthian Church was a bad Church did all kind of stuff but here Paul says I'm speaking wisdom to them this this folk did all kind of stuff read the book of Corinthians but he said I'm speaking wisdom to them that are in spite of yet you speaking wisdom to them who we talking to you know you're not talking H you talking to me uh no talking who you talking to not the Corinthians couldn't be I speak wisdom to them that are what perfect yet not the wisdom of this world are you with me nor of the what the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a what in a mystery praise God it's it's a mystery uh uh to to the devil it's a mystery he don't he can't quite figure this out he can't see who you are all he sees is your faults all he sees is every time you make a mistake that's all he sees but I'm speaking wisdom to them that are perfect are you with me when we speak wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom is here the devil blind to it if our gospel be he is here to them that are whom the God of this world has what blinded the mind the devil blind he can't see but you see it's given into you to know know the Mistress of the Kingdom ain't that right but I'm speaking to them in Parables they don't know are you with me I said the devil don't know do you know which God ordained before what the world until who who is he talking to I'm talk he's talking to me he's talking about me into my our Glory are you with me so what's going on here I want to know what's going on and I'm just reading the Bible and I don't know what's going on tell me what's going on let's see which none of the princes of this world knew right they ver for had they what y'all y'all want to believe there they crucified him and they're crucifying him the second time so the prophet said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and what do you say as the Bride of Jesus Christ what forgive them cuz they don't understand what they doing are you with me so the Bible said had they known it if the devil knew exactly what he was doing had they known that that princes of this world if they would have known it Hallelujah they would what see y'all believe that if they would have known what they were doing they wouldn't have never did it K officers amen all of those folk crucifying P said I wash my hand I I want nothing to do with it but he had blood on his hand ain't that right he said I found no fault in the man but yet he still had to do it he had to do it brother and sister don't get upset with folks that have to do what they do have to live like they live don't get upset praise God I hope you see something praise God if the devil didn't do it we' still be Sinners if the devil did not do what he did there would be no Redemption are you with me amen somebody talking about I don't know why Jesus loved me oh but I'm so glad he did are you with me I know why he loved me praise God now I know didn't know back then but now I know he loved me amen and I'm glad he loved me are you glad he loves you so by the grace of God it's many things and many examples see the devil did did not believe they said did not that deceiver say that on the third day he going to get up they said I want you to go and they put him in Joseph tomb and they said I want you to go put God there and makeing sure that he don't get up praise God the devil was doing what he done because he wanted to get rid of this Jesus I'm going get rid of him praise God but he was in trouble isn't that right praise God he was trying to get rid of one praise God but he didn't know what was going to come after praise God when he got of Jesus praise God he done himself a disservice Prophet said he lost his Stinger praise God he didn't he don't have none he don't have one now praise God praise God death is swallowed up in Victory he lost his keys are you up me if he only knew that he was going to lose his key he wouldn't have done it amen if he only knew he was going to lose his power he wouldn't have done it well because he
