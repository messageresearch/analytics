sarah and you know just praying and asking god and i thought what what a future home we have what a future home that we have as believers to understand our destiny where we headed what god got in store for you and i and so we understand most people think it's just that we're going up yonder and that's it but we have a thousand years to spend with the bridegroom on earth so by the grace of god

lord and passing of his brother lord for your comfort their hearts in the name of jesus christ we pray amen book of revelation 20. hallelujah god is good amen pray for brother van and the family over there and trinidad also god would help them in their time troubles and be with them in jesus name revelation 20 1 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the keys at the bottom of this pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old servant which is the devil and satan bound him a thousand years and cast him in the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more to the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loose a little season and i saw thrones and they just set upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years may god bless the reader towards you may be seated tonight as we talk concerning the millennium reign the millennium and parallel and the millennium are the same as we're talking about the feasts of tabernacle the fisa tabernacle and then again we want to style it as we're talking about the kingdom age the kingdom age remember he comes as jesus comes his three son son a man son of god and son of david so as you look at the son a man that's prophet and son of god holy ghost throughout the church ages back to son of man in this age prophetic ministry back to son of david are y'all with me son of david and that is that's king pilot put a king of the jews in other words he was the jews were in anticipating the kingdom age so in acts 1 it says here in acts 1 and 4 and being a symbol i'm going to try to take it slow i know i said a subject like this i would just have to take a day or saturday or something and teach for three or four hours take a break and come back and teach some more where i can put all the pieces together and all but i'm going to try to give y'all a little synopsy and hopefully praise god you can kind of look into things on your own and if you need if you have questions we'll be glad to answer those questions for you are you with me now when i said the feast of tabernacle remember you have the feast the passover you have the feast of unleavened bread you have the feast of first fruits and you have the feast of pentecost so jesus he said when i see the blood i pass over you are you with me the feasts are passed over the face of unleavened bread this is the bread that was broken for you are you with me feast of the first fruits first one to raise from the dead resurrection feasts of pentecost the seven ages seven times seven and then on the fifth it was jubilee so the day of pentecost was fully come amen then you had the feasts of trumpets called an israel by to her homeland so dealing with the jews and so forth then we have the feast of atonement where where israel recognizes the messiah the one where did you get those wounds in your hand and then after the feast of atonement you have the feast of tabernacle so during the time of moses and elijah god reveals himself to the israel so there'll be a return in great revelation period god have those two prophets revelation 11. are you with me so by the grace of god that's why i said to take time just just to bring you up to the feast the millennium and fisa tabernacle and so forth to bring you there then you can see where you come from till you get there are you with me so that'll take but i don't style myself as a teacher but if i taught i would teach so slow so to take hours and hours and i see why teachers take so long so by the grace of god because it certainly would take me long so by the grace of god now i said acts 1 and 4 it says being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which he says ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hints and when they therefore were come together the acts of him saying lord without at what with i at what do what restore amen again see once they had it will die at this time restore again the kingdom to israel isn't that right so jesus after his resurrection and talking about almost sending promise they said lord will not this time restore the kingdom to israel so israel was anticipating the king he said my kingdom is not of this world but they thought he and you remember blind bartimaeus said jesus that son of david have mercy upon us they would recognize him as the son of david as that king that was supposed to come and subdue their enemies and establish his of his kingdom and love his government there shall be no end he had arrived but yet that portion of his ministry he was only displaying amen a portion he's coming as savior amen but they they didn't miss they miss him coming as savior they wanted him to come as king and he come amen as to sacrifice his life and to die wounded father transgress bruised fire he come to fulfill that portion of scripture but they were looking for him to restore the kingdom they were going you know sometimes we look for the physical amen and god want to restore the spiritual and when god come to restore the spiritual they were looking for the physical restoration and it was being fulfilled in the spiritual which far exceeded the natural so what they were looking for in the natural and in the physical they meant god would restore it in amid the spirit he said amen he said the kingdom of god coming not without the observation neither shall they say low here lord there for the kingdom of heaven is within him he said the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and what joy in the holy ghost he was giving them the spiritual before they received the natural and physical god was going to give them the spiritual you see what i'm saying sometimes we want the natural first before we get the spiritual amen but if we get the natural first we may not think we need the spiritual so god gives you the the spiritual kingdom they meant that amen you might be worthy when he gives you the physical are you open sometimes we want the physical manifestation but god wants you to be saved first and have eternal life before it gives you just physical healing and supply your needs are you with me because your soul needs it more and if you never got it in the physical realm it's good that you got it in the inner man hallelujah that if this after house were dissolved if this house healed amen praise god oh job wasn't worried about it he said naked came under this world neck and i shall return the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord but sometimes folks are focusing on the outer thing and they need to be focusing on the inward man he said though our outward man perish our ignorant man is renewed that all day by day didn't i tell you it's hard for me to teach so god will do something for you and see though that's what it is difficult when people are setting amen in the physical realm and they're uh they're caught up amen see that's why he said except a man is born again he cannot see in other words he cannot understand the kingdom of god except a man be born a warning spirit he cannot what error oh you look man that's why the prophet said amen uh this is spiritual food and new season he said this is bride food amen it's too rich for the rest of the world i'm not gonna say you know it's just too rich wrong they wouldn't know what to do with it they couldn't they couldn't hold these mystery truths brother friend they couldn't hold it they spit it back up because it's too rich for them but this is bright food amen god opened the word to you amen because it's bright food it's for you it's for you amen hallelujah that's why blessed are you he is because you hear amen not just him but you're able to eat this amen because you know it's spiritual food in due season amen god is good amen you can go back over to future home and spiritual food and due season and stuff like that and and see what i'm feasting on and get me excited amen sometimes i tell you sometimes i don't say nothing you just have to search it out okay so he says will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel and i you know it it's very real that people are so busy looking amen for the rapture the physical rapture and then not being caught up now for he says come up hither amen he's calling the bride out of the church amen is calling you up praise god out of the seventh into the broad age are you with me so god is trying to get you out amen in translation he's rapturing you he's calling you out and calling you up with a high calling amen while all the spewing and going on and all the plane crashes and wrecks he's calling you to be astronauts are you with me to fly higher amen to break the sound barrier amen what all of these fussing and going on you up there amen praise god hallelujah it's not something we're talking about it's something we got to manifest as a lot of folk can talk it but let's manifest it praise god that we actually have taken off into another spear oh hallelujah that you are living in another dimension praise god you're locked in you've taken off praise god hallelujah praise god you were astronauts praise god that somebody want to learn how to fly a plane but this is not plain this is astronaut praise god but by the grace of god he says and he's sending them in the seventh verse he said unto them it's not for you to what are you with me it's not for you to what the time are the way yo yo y'all watching it's not for you to know the time or of the season i can see i'm not gonna get nowhere tonight i might as well stop it's not for you to know what you know if you miss this you missing your day of visitation and because it's because you sometimes the ministry might think people understand what they're saying and they don't understand not a thing yet they are right there and said i never heard that before but i want you to listen make sure you understand what is being said where you can be raptured and you can be caught up because faith come by what here and by faith in it was what now if you want to be translated faith comes by hand and hearing by the word of god so what's the purpose of the message without to give you rapture in what faith and praise god as the word is being revealed and opened to you and as you feed on the word you become what you feed on are you with me so the word amen become materialized in you you become the word you become the rapture the rapture is made up of who individuals right so when you speak of the rapture uh uh will be caught up to me what and the word rapture being caught up who's going you caught up so what happened the word has taken on what flesh manifestation so amen it's in motion it's an action amen so what happens remember i started off the spiritual first the event is going to take place the rapture event is going to take place the corporate body will meet him in the air but there's an invisible union taking place what nah amen and if you're not a part of this invisible union the world don't know nothing about it amen two will be in the bed one taking another left you up man two of me in the field want to be taking another lap two of you sat down in the church one be taking another left why one catcher of revelation the other dawn are you with me oh i don't want to be left here praise god amen praise god he said every man be ignorant let him be ignorant amen he said none of the wicked she'll understand but to what but why she'll understand isn't that right praise god i hope you're wise enough to catch what god is saying that you can get out of here you don't want to stay here i don't want to stay here how about you amen i want to go home amen we talking about a future home amen praise god it says it is not for you to know the time of the season which the father has put in what in his own power but did he leave it there a conjunction are you with me an english professor he didn't stop that did he he said but isn't that right so that's just a pause it's a but i'm not stopping there and leaving you there in other words he said i'm not leaving you hanging i'm not leaving you there i got i i i got something else i want to say just don't take that and stop but he said what but you shall receive power after that what so he says it's not for you to know the time another season which the father has put in his own power are you with me but you shall receive power after that what see what if the holy ghost don't come upon you praise god there is no way for you to know your time in the season until the holy ghost come are you with me but he said because he kept it in his own power but you shall receive power after that what and if the power that reads jesus from the dead dwight in you it's gonna work it's gonna work quick and what the devil don't want you to say it but it's gonna work it's gonna quicken your mortal body praise god hallelujah what kind of power holy ghost power amen praise god that power is going to quicken you praise god you some folks ain't got enough power to clap their hands hallelujah oh hallelujah you can't get amen out of them amen but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you amen praise god the kind of power they meant to raise jesus from the dead that shame power is in you praise god that quick and power i'm talking about getting you ready amen for your destination this millennium reign brother and sister hallelujah you've overcome something amen you had faith to obey overcomers of this age praise god you overcome us in this thing praise god thank god that you overcame god gave you the power to overcome when the enemy come laying like a flood the spirit of the lord lift up a statement praise god when that raymond death in hell come riding they meant god gave you an eagle anointing to come back to pay a horse rider amen i'm so glad that you have the power amen god is good amen so as we look at that let's just go to matthew 24. i got other things i'm coming back to the power and uh the time no man knows the time of the season i'll get back there 24 and 32 see god is you know setting a little a stage here that you can understand that it's not just the time of the season but he want to zero in on a little bit more than that and remember when the disciples asked jesus as he said in the mount of olives and disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world amen and he wanted he wanted to say take heed and no man deceive you man he should come in my name said i'm christ and shall deceive many and that's your here or walls and rumors of walls see that you be not troubled and then he said all these things amen should come to pass but the end is not yet nation should rise against nation and kingdom against kingdoms and he went on to say many things amen but i want to skip down to the 32. amen sometimes you can read the whole chapter amen it's a lot to be said as probably god opened up the seals and took this chapter and amen so by the grace of god you can look into those things it causes you to see if you if you don't uh you know if you want to pass some exam if you're going to be a nurse you're going to be a lawyer you're going to be a doctor you're going to be whatever you got exams you got to pass you got to be the bible says search the scriptures foreign you what you think you have eternal life a day or day to what he didn't hung him thirsty after writing to share what amen if you ain't got time for god then god don't have time to show you if you ain't got if you don't seek you you can't you can't find but he said he that seek amen knock and what but what happened if we just come to church and want somebody else to seek for you you want somebody else to study to show themselves to prove for you the bible says studies show not self approve unto god a word who needed not to be ashamed study amen so amen that you might be able to give an answer to every man concerning the hope that's in you are you with me see what happens to people they get too lazy in the spirit they got time for everything but they ain't got time to look into the word and and start lord i want to know you i want to know you amen because i know you reveal yourself in your own word and lord reveal the word to me because that's where i'm gonna find you because god is hidden and simplicity revealed himself in the same amen with whom is the arm of the lord revealed amen for he should grow up as a tender plant and let the root out dry ground amen somebody got to seek amen somebody got a knock somebody got to stop all of this nonsense stuff and being caught up in everything but the word of god brother and sister it's time to get about our father business folks out there are dying and you ain't concerned enough about your soul you're more concerned about who won the game who did this who did that and you know but when it come down our soul amen we seem to think somebody else gonna see about it he said martha martha you're in trouble about many things but mary cares about that thing amen it means the most amen she was that jesus feeding she was feeding on that word martha was mad at her because she wouldn't help clean you are you with me she said you travel about many things but mary right here trying to feed on this word are you with me i'm gonna tell you something it's something about feeding on the word your soul needs the word nana i'm not telling you not not to do the other thing but i'm saying you need that word you need to start feeding on the word if you don't feed on the word your soul gonna you're gonna get weak if you don't pray amen and feed on the word you're going to die spiritually you wonder why folk folks don't backslide overnight they don't wake up one morning and they backslid praise god the devil until it started moving amen just like amen he said say to the mountain be thou remove and not die in your heart it might move one grain at a time and you may not see amen but god is moving the mountain are you what man and satan the same way he building a stronghold little by little next thing you know amen the devil didn't trap you you so far back amen because you're not doing the things that don't cause you to be strong you're not strengthening yourself you're not praying through where you needed the anointing you need the power of god in your life when you find yourself in a drought amen you need rain amen they were needing rain here because we were in a drought condition and amen and then the rain started falling they said we they had a lot of rain but they said we're still in a drought amen we got to get a certain water level to know that the drought is over oh god praise god we got to get enough spirit in us to know that our drought is over praise god just because it pulled out a little bit that don't mean you out of it yet it took a long time amen there was no rain there was no water it was no spirit there was no light oh are you want me to get in the condition that folk got in it took a long time to not feed the spirit praise god but we got to be oh hallelujah hallelujah so every time god gives you a little drizzle and a little pouring down and a little point out don't thank you out of your drought come on somebody it's got to go down to the root the water ain't got deep enough for him and the water never got to come on up praise god till you got to aim and let it overflow yeah god i want it to overflow again yeah like rivers of water hallelujah oh yes lord hallelujah just fill me up lord let me overflow god yeah god let it come out lord hey praise god let it deal oh god hallelujah things that's been stopping the oh god the floor of the spirit of life uh christ

anointing god keep pointing oh lord i need a little bit more amen i need a lot more god i need a lot more god i need more god i want to lose myself in you lord hallelujah i want to get lost now lord i

drizzle down a little pole down here and a little pole down there and oh that ain't enough amen praise god lord thank you amen for the little that you gave me but lord i need a little bit more lord i need a lot more hallelujah oh i can see folk getting stirred up now praise god i can see him get fired up now hollywood here's something to slow the man down when he fired up praise god it's something for the devil to knock you down when you got so much going for yourself praise god hallelujah praise god the devil trying to move out your way when they know you got a lot of steam behind you hallelujah when your body ain't making it it don't take much for the devil to knock you backwards amen but when you got it amen when you're running amen hallelujah when you're dragging along and can barely get to church they meant praise god came making the church they met badly amen getting in the house of god amen are you up man but when you're running praise god you're running amen and the

got there did i get that no 32 24 32 did i get there no i told y'all it's hard for me to teach right y'all pray for a teacher because i seem like i'm a preacher in it but lord help me he said not learn the power of the fig tree when his branches is yet tender and put it forward to leaves you know the summer is what nah you know the fig tree represents israel right okay so likewise ye when you see all these things know that it's what it's near even at the what do i amen it was good back in the 60s and 70s even in the 80s when israel they said israel had become a nation the prophet god said in 1946 the angel of the lord appeared to him they said israel back in their homeland gave him a ministry of a healing revival he went around the world praying for sick folk massive healing revivals all over the place god used him powerfully 1948 israel was declared a nation by the u.n the fig tree began to come forth israel had to come back the dry bones that ezekiel saw in ezekiel 37. son of man can these moans live he said lord god don't know it here he said the spirit of the lord took me up into a valley and it's full of bones and he said son of man kenny's bone live he said lord god died notice he said prophesy to the bones are you with me i said oh you dry bones hear the word of the lord that was israel became a seed in the green army are you with me he prophesied to the bones amen then he had to breathe on those wounds and breath had to come into him amen illegal become a nation again are you with me i don't have time see i told you i'll take hours hours because i got to do all of this to bring you up where you understand where you're at and how you're going to get from where you are now in the millennium ring praise god what you got to overcome in this day by understanding the word of god bringing you up to that time are you with me let's see where you at in the word i want you to see where you're at scripturally because most people read the bible it's written 2 000 years ago and they talk about 2 000 years ago but they don't know that things that pertaining to here and now when you see your place in you your name in the book then that amen causes you to be quickened mary saw her name in the book all she had it was the old testament and what isaiah said but her name was there in the book it meant nobody could read her name but she could read her own name are you with me because she knew who the virgin was amen why how did she know it was revealed to her by the angel gabriel amen and she believed what the angel said and that's what happens when the word begins to open to you as an individual it reveals your name are you up man and then you see your name and you see your day and you see what you are to manifest that's what peter stood up on the day of pentecost said this is that so he saw he meant joel and what he was prophesied of and he saw the action that took place on that day he said this is that which is spoken of by the prophet joe here and this is what he promised and in the last days i poured my spirit amen and this is dice oh you look man see he recognized that peter peter saw himself in the book are you with me now his name wasn't there in joel 2 30 but he saw his name there that he knew who it was pertaining to him so he said peter now the rest of the world russell folk couldn't see peter but peter saw peter amen and that's what you got to see you got to see this is a personal revelation to you as an individual you must see who you are for yourself and the bride recognize who she is then the rapture will take place now you can be caught up now or you can wait around and thinking that amen when the lord's cracked the sky that you're going to go how are you going to go when you don't know who you are are you with me but when you recognize who you are amen then god amen you know that it pertaining to you are you with me you know i feel like just taking on a saturday and let's just teach on this you all eat lunch and come on back another couple hours but maybe another time but let me let me go down here he says you know that some are not even at the door and so forth the summit is nine 33rd verse says and likewise ye when you see the all these things know that it is near even at the door verily verily i say unto you this what the generation that's why it says generations 40 years that's why everybody looked for the coming of the lord in 88. the jews everybody over in the church world and all the people that study bible prophecy was looking for a generation supposed to be 40 years in 88 everybody was looking for the rapture or the coming of the lord in the millennium in the coming of the tribulation period ushering in and so forth the whole nine yards amen but what happened somebody you were you were you hadn't got in yet it was because of you it was because of praise god hallelujah maybe i wasn't ready are you with me god had to you know he had to he had to get some rough hands out of your life he had to get some wrinkles some spots and some blemishes out he had that last predestinated seed to get in and he had to wait on that one was he waiting on you amen you said i wasn't born that's why he waited he waited till you got born you said i wanted to say that he waited for you praise god aren't you glad he waited because he could have came in 88 and you could have been out but he waited are you with me so he says this generation should not uh pass to all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not what but uh john this is where i want to get to you y'all with me everybody woke up this is where i want to get to 36th verse but of the what and what okay now y'all remember what we read in acts 1. i really remember acts 1 the time the time and this what noise what now here jesus said of what with that day an hour amen no it's what no man not what not you said that's why the seventh seal and revelation eight and the opening seventh seal there was silence in heaven are you with me he said not the angels of heaven but what but my father only right then he put a conjunction there i mean uh you know but he put a butt there it might be whatever he put up but but he said well but as what he gave you some perimeter he gives you some things to look at but i want you to see something here i'm not going to leave you even there now we we were saying he said the time in the season but he said the day and hour but no man but my father in acts 1 he said no man know the time of the season but the father right but he said after is it power but you should receive power after the holy ghost is coming now okay let's look at this again he said but as it was in the days of work that were as it was in the days of noah were so also shall what so he shows you what kind of days amen what happened what kind of atmosphere to be okay that's how the man would be okay i i'm going somewhere else i'm going somewhere else i want you to see if you go back to acts one go back to acts one you said the time and the season give me that scripture that's one gail give me that scripture read out loud acts one the time in season acts one and what seven okay read it but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you okay y'all with me now y'all see in matthew where he says no man know the day not the hour are you with me i i i hadn't got to my millennia yet right but i'm going to first thessalonians 5. first thessalonians 5. you know it's something missing in the church world today and that is the revelation of jesus christ they have no idea what where we at scripture scripturally and i said this is the bride food it's not for them out there amen because it's for you first first thessalonians 5. are you with me let's go somewhere let's get out of here let's let's really get to digging into this word and let's eat this word are you looking it says but of the time and season brethren you have no need that i what right unto you for yourself what okay now all the other times you say you don't know now paul says you know what perfectly who he talking to you you know perfectly you know perfectly that that that the day of the lord come as a what for when they should say what peace and safety then sudden destruction coming upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not what but yeah you work but your brethren are not in what that that day shall work so it's not going to overtake you as a thief amen that means okay let me let me go on and ye are all the children of the what and the children of the what children of the day we are not of the what no or what therefore let us not sleep as do but let us watch and be sober are you with me because you're watching but you you're not just watching anything you know what you're watching amen see people say well i'm watching watching what praise god you got to know what to watch amen praise god if you don't know

enough to for her son and her to eat and die amen but god sent her the word and said feed him first make a cake for me amen and told her amen praise god what was it amen all the men and widows were in
