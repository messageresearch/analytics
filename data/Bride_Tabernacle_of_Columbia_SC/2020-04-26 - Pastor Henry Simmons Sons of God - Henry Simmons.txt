no God with life difficulties father we ask you to bless some now lovely you blessed a little north your word this morning speak to our hearts in Jesus name but we need to know help us in Jesus name Amen god is good amen we want to look at first John the third chapter appreciate the songs appreciate the worship appreciate all of you here and that online God is so good first John we want to talk to this morning about the sons of God this morning what it really means to be a son or daughter God because many people are there claim it and then naming it but by the grace of God the Word of God to discern the thoughts in the tense of the heart behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world North us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure who said I committed sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin who said abide in him Senate not and whosoever sinneth has not seen him neither know him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous and even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God amen in here in this the children of God are manifest in the children of the devil who said what does not righteous is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother we god bless you each word you may be seated this morning as we talk about the sons of God the Bible tells us here that now are we the sons of God he didn't sin when we get to heaven will be a son of God when we die we will be the son son of God let me just broaden our perspective on this as we talk about the sons of God I'm talking about sons and daughters of God and I believe that God was building a masterpiece throughout the church ages and that masterpiece God was hewn out the stone and he was making man in his own image and as the sculpture began to layout the masterpiece he began to lay a foundation maybe it looks to the natural eye like oh just a big rock but it's something that the one that's doing the work he has something in his mind an image and it adds he has an image in his mind he began to go to work was on the stove I believe the Bible says Paul says as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation the foundation has to be laid for the masterpiece amen so by the grace of God God is building his masterpiece his church putting this rock I'll build my church the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it they meant God he meant as he made Adam in his own image in his own likeness God today is building his masterpiece he's making man in his own image they make it his own likeness he said now we decide the god and does not yet appear what we shall be Amen God builds in you and I in his own image and his own likeness it does not yet appear what we shall be praised God but I believe but when he shall appear the Bible said we shall be like him amen and I believe that God has come in these last days that he wants to see man to be like him amen I want to see he meant I believe the purpose of Eve was to reproduce Adam and if the first favorite Eve was a reproduce Adam he meant the Bible tells us in second to riches eleven Lisa the serpent beguiled Eve to assert ility so your minds should be corrupted the simplicity that is in Christ he said why I have exposed you to one husband amen so the husband a meant to the church he meant Adam was Eve husband and the last Adam he meant which is Christ he meant had a wife and his wife is the bride the church he meant and the church is his body are you appear now in it it does not yet appear what we shall be but I want you to know in things that are to be they meant God had you in his mind and he said now you were four days he meant before the foundation of the world so what God had in mind he began to hew out he begin to heal out the mountain a stone that can smote the image on the feet oh you up oh I'm going to fall but let me give you so much there but by the grace of God go back here in simplicity and one first on three and one behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we shall be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not see if the world know you amen then chances are you're not a son of God the Bible said love not the world neither the things that are the world any man love the world the love of the father's not in him are you with me so there must be a difference between the sons of God the children of God and the tutor of the devil are you up there the Bible said we in pastime was walked according to the course of the world there were by nature two children around but God that's rich in mercy he meant God by His grace heed us and washed us in his blood and because God saved us we don't walk according to the course of this world you has he quickened his made alive who were dead and trust my eyes and you'll see as he fee the two talked about it amen but God has quickened us made us alive even I want you to check your DNA out in order to be a son of God you must know who your father is and Jesus said those that claim to be his children amen they said that we are ever have seeds and we don't be born of fornication they talk down oh Jesus they thought Jesus was born of fornication but he was born of a virgin are you with me so they looked at Jesus as though Jesus did not have the DNA of God even Jesus knew his father was and he knew where he came from he said I came from God and I go back to God he knew that he was aim at the logo see that he knows that he was the very Express image of God even he knew we came from he came from above and he was going back to where he came from he came from being the pillar of fire God above us but he was God with us and that same God that was a bomb in the garden with us it's God in us now and you did amen you gotta check out your DNA do you know who your father is do you know who you are if you understand your DNA and understand who you are then you shall walk circumspectly as I miserly get brother Ernest said not as flus but redeemed of time because the days are evil well you up me we got a mission to accomplish the mission might seem impossible but God put you and I here sons and daughters of God he said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil why do you want me so you need to start this going to the devil are you by the grace of God he said below now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is Paul talks about now we see through a glass darkly amen but one day we won't see - we we see we understand in Paul we see but what when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with they meant so he says about faith hope and charity but the greater is the law brother and sister you got to check your DNA where you come from you come from the great fountain of love and out of love Amen out of that great fountain the logos we're not from God they met and the word were not from God the word became flesh in the beginning was the word the word before it was a word it was in the express it was was was all in a virgin called Mary the Holy Ghost over shouted her praise God hallelujah and out of that Holy Ghost he meant the father of Jesus was she was found with the child the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was Jesus father they met the God is a spirit and a spirit could not die but Jesus was on a mission the Bible said the wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he said great is the mystery of godliness God was - in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels - God came down in flash for they met the word was made flesh how can the spirit in a take on a body how can God take on a body somebody said he was both human and divine God can do what he wants but who has known the mind of God that he's gonna instruct God you can take tell God what he can do and what he can't do God can do what it wants because He is God but what it means for you and I to be sons and daughters of God Amen I thank God that he meant I know my father yes they met praise God many of claiming to be sons and daughters of God they met but God is not a fornicator or adultery are you with me you can't omit John God to a denominational system they met when made up a man made creeds and dumbs they meant he won't be unequally yoked together with unbelievers he meant God in it amen you are if he Amen was born by the Holy Ghost then your birth is by the Holy Ghost your DNA is holy notes connected they meant the life of the flesh is in the blood praise God and the life of the flesh is in the blood desaad came blood and water and he purchased the church with his own blood of the blood came to life praise God and the life that was in the blood came back on the believer on the day of Pentecost showing that the power was in the blood was in sea in the sea could reproduce itself because it was dramatized cannot see because you won't see because you were a part of God because you aim a God who knew you and he attained you to be assured other folks can't believe us they're satisfied would be a member of the church and a part of a church in the system but they don't know who their father here you got to know who your father is your DNA you just are not satisfied with a half-built masterpiece you got to come in the very image of God you got to come into the fullness of Christ Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead body and through our ages and throughout with God began to manifest itself in a Eva ham eyes and then Jacob and began to come on and amen Joshua and begin to come on in the different David and Solomon and different one Jeremiah and Isaiah but the fullness of the Godhead body that was Jesus Christ and all that they were expressing as he was expressing himself in shows about Joseph they met was not the fullness of God he was only fresh in them perfection we look at in that praise God Ava Hammond with the father faith and we look at Jacob Amen and we look at eyes express amen faith hope and charity amen and then perfection through Joseph are you a pair so we need to look at the fullness of the Godhead bodily God amen collectively throughout seven churches bringing a bride on the scene working a work Amen throughout the ages to bring the statue of a perfect man they meant to bring his fullness into the body again expressing his glory again and to a people they meant to express that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he meant the power that worked in Jesus or work in his bride or amen the works that I do shall you do also the same God working out himself through you expressing his fullness amen God want to express his life this is it's not about I'm saying is it's not about you know I said some things a lot of people want a certain part of God but they don't want all of God but we ought to not be satisfied with just a potion of God we ought to want all that God is and all that God has in store for us we ought to want all of God are you with me so many people go to church and they're satisfied with a good song or good dance they're satisfied with just a meant a good sermon but you that hunger thirst after righteousness you must surrender you everything your all in all to God I'm surrendered everything and a lot of people surrender are just enough amen to feel good pretty good about themselves but you've got to surrender all to God where God can express all that he once expressed in you sons and daughters of God I tell you don't be satisfied with just a small potion of God you must want all of God the fullness of God all that God wants to do through you and all that God wants to do in you you must want everything everything amen I find if you surrender to a little you get a little what if you surrender all you can get all that God wants to express now the purpose I said the purpose of the sons and daughters of God was a destroy the works of the devil amen now if you don't know what you supposed to do and you don't know who you are chances are you're not gonna be doing what you said what are you doing cuz you don't know who you are see because some folks think Amen I spoke in tongues I got the Holy Ghost but does the Holy Ghost amen now it's not just a tongue just a person it man I want you to know it must be the person must be Jesus in you and if Jesus is not in you Amen you can never express him okay and that's what happens people get tongues and shout they get a prophesy in the shout but you got to get the person and the Bible says God is love are you with me and when you have perfect law he said by this men should know you that are my disciples you clutch because you have loved one one for another amen praise God he said now I want you to know that the conclusion of the last verse that I read he said if you if you say you know God and you hate your brother you're lying amen so he said that it says in the temple or she said in this the children of God are manifest that and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness and out of God neither he that what love is not it's brother you know some people have a problem with expressing law you know you got to love the ones that hate you see that's nothing your love is unconditional it's not under the basis of how people treat you you love them what what people say about you what people do to you you love unconditionally you love because that's what you are that's a very character of your father God is love you can't do nothing else about love it doesn't matter what folks say about you or what they done to you you cannot be anything God is identified by his own characteristics Amen if you saw Jesus Jesus would be identified because he's loved and Jesus was the expression of God's love he because he came from that great fountain are you with me and out of God came for the agape love and agape love is a love that the world cannot produce a man I don't care how much you love your mom you love your daddy amen you love your sister you love your brother I don't care how much you love the church I don't care how much you love your preacher Amen I've got pain love can only be expressed you can only get that kind of love from God amen and you was not born with that kind of love are you a man so your DNA amen must come from heaven they meant because this DNA that connects me out to mix my father David Simmons amen amen that's a that's a DNA that I can go and you can take the blood test and show that David Simmons is my father but to know that God is your father amen it takes a faith in the blood of Jesus Christ to reproduce amen the very life of Jesus Christ coming down in you and if that life Amen that was in Christ and then it finds itself in you amen then Christ that was known by his own characteristics when Jesus walk he manifest you got lost and when you walk the earth you got to manifest who Jesus is because why somebody said it no more I do live it but it cried to live in me I love me so it comes a time let's go to Galatians on 2 and 22 and 20 amen I know I was skipping a little bit but it's got to come to a place that you've got to die to yourself amen see in order to break for the life it takes to death amen the call of wheat or whatever goes into the ground and it rottens and it dies and let him come forward life are you with me so in order to have the new birth it takes of death somebody had to die for you to live Jesus died for us to live are you with me and Jesus been the seed of Abraham died in our stead to produce more sons of God ok 2 and 20 Paul says here I am crucified with Christ or you with me I'm crucified that's what happens it must become a crucified life sons and daughters of God and they come to the place I'm crucified I got to live a crucified life my life amen is no more my own amen I live by the faith of the Son of God that gave himself for me God died he died for me and I love because he did that for me yeah I in turn want to give back to God what he gave to me he gave me eternal life and I'm only expressing what who my father is because I have his blood and his attributes are being expressed in my life praise God somebody tell it was fifteen of Boston somebody said all y'all similar look alike and sometimes we might even walk away and sometimes we might sign a life oh you want me why because we all Simmons got the same mama same daddy are you a man so why should we look like a Simmons amen the Bible said we know that we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is oh you want me you got to come to the point that you check it out I live a crucified life yes it's a lot of things that my flesh wont to do amen Jesus came to the port he said Amen father if it be possible let this cup pass but you know I'm in the birth pains and I'm ready amen to be offered a pulse and I'm ready to be delivered and know if I don't do if I don't drink this cup oh the bride what's inside of me what's inside of the woman in pain and she goes to her pain of pain she knows that if I don't go through these birth pains that the child won't be born but I got to go through the pain to bring forward the child the while it's going through birth pains it's telling us amen the world it's going to this birth pain just shaking into the rock and in the role and God knows waiting to come forward oh yes so what is going on you might break it strange when I know is ready to be delivered something is going on hallelujah we're not gonna have to go through Corona soldiers Carolla only took them to a better place nothing just be able to separate me from the love of God amen because your sons and daughters of God you can rest on those full assurance they met Paul described and I'm crucified with Christ amen that's what it takes of crucified life they meant you got to come and look at the cross and you got to see what Jesus done for you amen that's my daddy that's my father he was crucified for me yeah God you died for me and I look at what you've been went through for me Lord I'm looking at the cross yes Lord because you will do it for me Lord amen that I don't have to die and go to hell not only was he crucified for us would he what the hell for us they met praise God preach to the soul that was in prison rose up out of death they're all in the grave with victory on his mind hey thank you victory now thank you for victory thank you brother and sister taking not strange concerning the fiery doctor which ought to try you you're going to go through some testing times into trials and some struggles and battles but don't think a stranger when you got in mind hey whatever you're making is alright that I got to drink let me drinking no but I know what you're doing on your only making me what I need to be Klaus wouldn't expect to come by hallelujah he's gonna see Jesus amen go see Jesus in me they met Kenny see Jesus in yeah that's what I want to see but it's some stuff he meant that's been blocking you he meant what God want to do and God is getting some of that stuff Archer amen in order to mold you into his image so he's got a chip he's got to get rid of a little bit of your temper they met praise God he got to get rid of a little bit things that your pity party that you been the crime and accent God want me they meant God said why not you they meant why not you amen praise God I chose you to go through it you go through what our dream for you if God I dated so let it be long hey man I don't care how many times you said father oh yes every possible let this cup pass but if that's what I got to drink let me drink it hallelujah if I gotta go through this long let me go through it Oh sometimes we want to bypass our crucifixion our crucified Life but Paul said I'm crucified with Christ come on somebody you're not of this world you're not a part of this world system this cosmos this world order amen God meet you you come from another world he meant your father amen praise God he meant your biological father and biological mother amen you might be proud of that pretty man but I will tell you even when the name of symbols is no more there's a name that's above every name he meant and I want you to know he said let everyone that name the name of Christ let him depart from iniquity they met Simmons won't be no more but Jesus hallelujah amen bypass the Simmons a man and a similar attribute and I got to come in to the attributes of my father amen which is from heaven and I got expressed the very attributes of God Simmons oh but he's coming back for the very character and his divine nature Oh y'all whip man praise God somebody said he meant the symbols that's a certain way and the palm was a certain way and come on somebody because we got a better one why yes why are we trying to hold on to the natural God is trying to walk to define why we trying to hold on to the world and God is trying to take you to heaven oh brother sister let him take you up higher high hallelujah mile you the sons of God I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless he said I live yet not i but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live it's not the life that I now live it's not my life this Zoe it's God's life when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then Zoe comes down and so it identifies that the life that's in you is not your own praise God it didn't come through Charlotte Martin and David Simmons of Charlotte Simmons and David Simmons but it came in the life that I now live it came from God amen praise God if it's because of the new birth praise God that I exceed that birth over my natural birth Amen thank God for my dad and thank God for my mom they meant but I got a mess a DNA that's what heaven praise God and I'm looking at the word image and I'm looking at a bride that's going to be the word in the last day and she's not going to be identified with some church title of some church denomination or some preacher Amen it won't be Bishop Simmons or pastor Simmons it won't be Bishop so-and-so on a pastor sort so it won't be prompted so-and-so on a property this it's going to be Jesus Christ amen so Jesus Christ is the one that God is going to ought to me yeah you're gonna have to serve are you with me so a lot of time often times people are trying to present an image an image of Daniel image of a man and we were reflecting so much internal image of the carnal they meant as if people were reflecting to I'm appalled and I'm a thief listen i polos there were a reflection they meant their DNA amen as though Paul was the one that died for them in stole a Paul that wrote most of the New Testament yet in Nepal a met description he says who is Paul or who was a polis or whose Seif was a who's Peter amen whose upholds these are of great apostles and men of God that you can hold to the image and hold to their likeness and you could extend them so some of us would separate ourselves and divide ourselves and I'm a I'm on this denomination I'm on that denomination we divide the church amen because we have schisms and in terms and we divide the body of Christ but Bible said Christ is not divided they may cry is not divided it's just one God amen has one that died for us he meant one planet or the water but God that gives the increase are you up man so I want you to know amen you got to watch amen amen there's one thing that when folks see Amen who we worshiping they meant the only one that we were watching in is Jesus Christ and he is the word oh you want me we ought to point people to one that's one God amen and he's Jesus Christ and he is the word we don't poke people to a church with on poor people to a man without people to an image we poke people to Jesus Christ and he is the world are you with me and if people are pointing in any other place amen I'll tell you sometimes when we please we make the Word of God secondary but I want to tell you something he's second to what he's second to none they met cheap the Word of God is fresh it doesn't matter what your child said what your preacher said it doesn't matter who the man where he comes from the Word of God is second to none they meant the word must be first this is the first book they meant this is the only book that God's gonna go by in charge every man by what's written in the book oh you will be now you might pull out another book you might pull out another man but I'll tell you this one man that's Christ Jesus he gonna change the world and righteousness are you up man so people better get and put them on a map put the word in his right position they mean you got to put Jesus Christ at the head of the church are you with me no Jesus Christ is not the head of the top then we gonna make what a man say the head of the church and no man has a right they meant to take the place of Christ are you with me because he said my glory well I'm not sharing with another oh you want me with no money praise God so we got to put it in the right perspective just a word of God Oh Lord what are you going on about I hope that you understand your Deen a where God where you came from you are product of the word amen your father is the word your husband is the way you are product of the very body a met bone of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word spirit of his spirit are you with me you come from God amen why it's about a new birth my faith will children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for many of us as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ oh you look man they meant that's why you must repent and be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and your promises you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen if you don't do it amen then you're not a here oh you would be he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he didn't believe it knock Charmy down hey man if you don't want Jesus you don't want eternal life the only life is in Christ he meant not side of Christ there is no life amen in Christ is the only place that you can find life praise God in the life of the flesh is in the blood and that's your DNA it's the bloody word praise God amen and where the caucus is the Egan's will be gathered how do you come back to the book come back to the Bible come back to God don't you rest on man main thoughts and ideas come back to the word amen Oh what are you doing back home where's your homeland don't worry God
