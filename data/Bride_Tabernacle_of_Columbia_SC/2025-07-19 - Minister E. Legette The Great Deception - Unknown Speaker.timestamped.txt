[32:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you
[32:22] this evening, Lord, as humble as we know
[32:24] how. Oh God,
[32:28] we know that the times, oh God, are hard
[32:31] and weary, Lord, so much, oh God,
[32:34] bereavement in the land. But God, I
[32:36] pray, oh Lord, that you would comfort
[32:38] those that are in bereavement today. And
[32:40] oh God, that you would give faith and
[32:42] wisdom. Lord, I just thank you for
[32:44] blessing us to be able to come to your
[32:46] house tonight, Lord. and God to be able
[32:48] to look to you, Lord, and call upon your
[32:50] name, God. You know, sometimes the flesh
[32:54] is weak, Lord, but we know the spirit is
[32:56] willing, God, we just pray you continue
[32:59] to bless your children. Bless those that
[33:01] are here, Lord. Bless those that desire
[33:03] to come but couldn't make it. Father,
[33:05] Lord, I pray, oh God, you bless those
[33:07] that are listening in, Lord. And, oh
[33:09] God, your people all over the world.
[33:12] Surely, God, we need a word from you,
[33:13] Lord. We need leadership and direction.
[33:17] Oh God, we need your spirit, God, that
[33:19] it'll give us confidence and boldness,
[33:22] oh God, to meet the challenge of the
[33:23] hour. For I know you will, Lord, because
[33:26] you said that when the enemy come in
[33:28] like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[33:30] will raise up a standard against them.
[33:32] And God, we thank you tonight for
[33:34] lifting up the standard. Thank you, God,
[33:36] for giving us that extra auction, oh
[33:39] God, to be able to press our way
[33:41] through. Father, we thank you, Lord, and
[33:43] we love you. We appreciate you with all
[33:45] our hearts. We ask if you said we said
[33:47] any done anything that ain't like you. I
[33:50] pray God you forgive us tonight. And oh

[33:58] Christians Lord. Lord we just thank you
[34:00] Lord tonight. Bless your children. Move
[34:02] in a mighty way. In the name of Jesus
[34:04] Christ we pray. Amen. Amen.
[34:08] Amen. We want to look at the book of
[34:10] Matthew by the grace of God. Matthew 3.
[34:30] Matthew 3 and we'll be at the first
[34:32] verse. If you got it, say amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "In those days came
[34:37] John the Baptist preaching in the
[34:39] wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent
[34:42] ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at
[34:44] hand. For this is he that was spoke that
[34:48] was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,
[34:51] saying, The voice of one crying in the
[34:54] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[34:56] Lord, make his path straight." And the
[34:59] same John had his raignment of
[35:01] camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair and a leather gird
[35:04] about his loins and his meat was locust
[35:06] and wild honey. Then went out to him
[35:10] Jerusalem
[35:12] went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea
[35:15] and all the region around Jordan and
[35:17] were baptized of him in Jordan
[35:19] confessing their sins. But when he saw
[35:22] many of the Pharisees and the scribes
[35:24] come to his baptism, he said unto them,
[35:28] "Oh generation of vipers, who have
[35:31] warned you to flee the from the wrath to
[35:34] come, bring forth therefore fruits meat
[35:38] uh for repentance? And think not to say
[35:41] within yourselves, we have Abraham to
[35:44] our father. For I say unto you that God
[35:47] is able of these stones to raise up
[35:50] children unto Abraham. And now also the
[35:55] axe is laid to the root of the trees.
[35:58] Therefore every tree which bringeth uh
[36:01] not forth good fruit is heuned down and
[36:04] cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you
[36:06] with water unto repentance. But he that
[36:09] cometh after me is mightier than I,
[36:12] whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He
[36:15] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[36:19] and with fire. May God bless the reading
[36:21] of his word.
[36:23] Tonight, just for a moment, by the grace
[36:26] of God, I want to minister on the great
[36:29] deception. Amen.
[36:31] on the great deception here, you know,
[36:34] uh reading in the scriptures. I was this
[36:37] just came to my heart uh the other week
[36:39] and I says, you know, John, John himself
[36:42] here, he had to set the record straight.
[36:44] Amen. He had to set the record straight
[36:48] and telling the people that especially
[36:51] the Pharisees and the scribes when they
[36:53] came out, he began to ask them, "Who
[36:55] warned you to flee from the wrath to
[36:57] come?" But he says, you know, because he
[37:00] knew what was in their hearts. He knew
[37:02] that their attitude and their their
[37:04] their pious ways, I guess, and he began
[37:08] to say to them, you know, is just
[37:10] paraphrasing it, don't take comfort in
[37:12] saying that we have Abraham our father
[37:16] because that that's that alone ain't
[37:18] going to save you or that alone ain't
[37:21] getting you into the kingdom. Can I say
[37:22] it that way? He says, "So don't take no
[37:25] comfort in that." He says, but he says
[37:28] you got to bring forth fruits meat of
[37:31] repentance. Right? And so John, like it
[37:34] says, he set the record straight even to
[37:37] as then as I believe the Holy Ghost
[37:40] wants to set the record straight even in
[37:42] the hour that we live in that it's a
[37:44] great deception going out. And I call it
[37:47] the great deception because many times
[37:50] people believe that just because you
[37:52] affiliated with a certain organization
[37:55] or you're affiliated with a certain
[37:56] group or your your daddy is is the
[37:59] pastor or the preacher or whatever it
[38:02] might be that that gives you some type
[38:04] of entitlement. But that's a great
[38:07] deception. You know, you got to come by
[38:10] the way of the cross. You got to come by
[38:12] the way of repentance just like
[38:13] everybody else did. I mean, just like
[38:16] everybody else has, you know, like one
[38:18] thing the prophet of God was bringing
[38:19] out about Mary and and how, you know,
[38:22] the Bible saying when they went in the
[38:23] upper room and Mary, the mother of
[38:25] Jesus, was with him, right? Because she
[38:28] wasn't even exempt from a born again
[38:30] experience just by her saying that, you
[38:32] know, I'm the mother of I had Jesus, all
[38:34] that, that wasn't enough. She still had
[38:37] God still had to come down and fill her
[38:40] with the Holy Ghost. So, it's a great
[38:43] deception going out and people are
[38:45] satisfied just being affiliated with a
[38:48] church or satisfied just being
[38:50] affiliated with a group, right? But like
[38:54] I said, that's a great deception. It
[38:56] doesn't when you when it's when it's uh
[38:58] when you come to God, it's you and God
[39:01] alone.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; It's not you and mom and daddy or you
[39:04] and friends or you and the pastor or you
[39:07] and whoever, whatever great man you tied
[39:10] to. You got to see Christ for yourself.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. And you got to But what it is I
[39:16] says that you know uh uh John here
[39:18] preaching and the thing is John knew
[39:21] that his ministry was to only get the
[39:24] people ready for the Messiah when he
[39:27] come. So he be to tell them you know yes
[39:30] but his his message was repentance. It's
[39:34] he says repent right even to the
[39:36] Pharisees and the sto those he told him
[39:38] the ashes laid where at the root of the
[39:41] tree come on God don't got no respect of
[39:43] person but his message to them was to
[39:47] repent because the kingdom of heaven is
[39:48] at hand but he also begin to let them
[39:51] know you know uh just just looking at it
[39:54] from a broad perspective you know he he
[39:56] he says he he he set the record he says
[39:59] that um it's one coming after me I'm
[40:02] just baptizing you the water, right? He
[40:05] says, "I'm just getting your hearts
[40:06] prepared, but the one that's coming
[40:08] after me, that's the one that you need
[40:11] to to get to." Not not me. He says, "So,
[40:15] you know, you had many that even after
[40:17] that that time would still follow John,
[40:20] but John clearly told him, I'm just
[40:22] baptizing you with water. I'm just
[40:23] getting your hearts ready." But when he
[40:26] come, he says, "I'm not I'm not even
[40:28] worthy to un loosen his shoes, the latch
[40:31] on his shoes." He says, "And he's the
[40:33] one that's going to baptize you with the
[40:35] Holy Ghost and fire." But even though
[40:38] people might have had great respect for
[40:40] John, and even Jesus said himself that
[40:42] there was no greater man born of a woman
[40:44] than John the Baptist, but what John saw
[40:47] himself as is as I'm not even worthy.
[40:51] Come on. He says when when Jesus come,
[40:54] he says, "You come unto me, but I need
[40:56] to be baptized of you." But Jesus told
[40:59] him, "But it cometh to fulfill all
[41:00] righteousness." But what it is, you
[41:02] know, and that's like I said from John
[41:05] himself, it it it's he had to set the
[41:08] record straight. It's me. It's
[41:09] everybody. It's no matter who it is, you
[41:12] got to meet Christ. You got to go to
[41:14] Christ for yourself.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight?
[41:17] &gt;&gt; But it's a great deception. I said that
[41:19] because you know uh uh in the first the
[41:22] first when you the road to eternal life,
[41:25] when you first get on that road, that's
[41:27] that's the road of repentance. You can't
[41:30] even start the journey without
[41:31] repenting. Come on. Many people think
[41:34] they can start the journey. They just
[41:35] come and oh, just join church. That's
[41:37] what I was talking about the other day.
[41:39] I was talking about some ideology and
[41:40] things. I was saying, you know, cuz I
[41:42] was talking to brother Damon is who it
[41:44] was. And I and we were talking about
[41:46] some situations and I said, "See, you
[41:48] know, you know why we can uh we can uh
[41:52] love God the way we do or we can depend
[41:54] on trust God the way we do because it
[41:57] was God that brought us out." Because we
[42:00] realized that the shape that we were in,
[42:02] it was nothing. Nobody talked to you and
[42:05] conformed you and tried to say, "Hey,
[42:07] you just need to come or you just need
[42:09] it was nothing. Hey, man, you might as
[42:10] well just come on to church." No, none
[42:12] of that. It was that you came to a place
[42:14] in your life
[42:16] &gt;&gt; to where God opened your eyes
[42:19] &gt;&gt; to let you know what kind of shape you
[42:22] were in.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; You might have thought I ain't bad as
[42:24] this next man, but when God opened your
[42:27] eyes and let you see that sin is sin.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. No big sin, little sin. We know
[42:35] some things is abomination and all and
[42:37] but sin is sin, right?
[42:39] &gt;&gt; And you come in the world that way. So
[42:42] God got to open your eyes and and and
[42:45] show you. And I said, "That's what it
[42:47] was. God opened our eyes, showed us how
[42:51] filthy we were." So it wasn't that you
[42:53] were coming to church cuz you just
[42:55] wanted to felt safety in the comfort of
[42:57] the church because you never could feel
[42:59] that. You had to know that God did
[43:02] something in your life that even if they
[43:05] close the church doors down today, I'm
[43:08] all right because God is living in my
[43:10] soul. Come on.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And that's where the people have missed
[43:15] it at.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's where people miss it
[43:18] from the young to the old might got
[43:21] gifts of the spirit might have this and
[43:23] that and they think oh affiliated with
[43:26] the message of the hour or whatever they
[43:27] might say or whatever organization of
[43:29] church but as I was saying on Sunday the
[43:32] scriptures he declared he says have you
[43:34] received the Holy Ghost since you
[43:36] believed? Not when you believed. Yes you
[43:39] can believe. Many believed and came out
[43:41] and got baptized of John. But John let
[43:44] them know this ain't where it stops at.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. After this one coming that's
[43:50] going to baptize you with the Holy
[43:52] Ghost, right? In fire.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; And that fire going to come to burn all
[43:58] the sin out your life. That fire going
[44:00] to come to burn all the desires out your
[44:02] life. That fire going to come to take
[44:04] away your will. And then you'll be to
[44:07] the place to where you say, "Lord, I I'm
[44:09] not even worried about my own motives
[44:11] and objectives. I just want to do
[44:13] whatever you ask me to do, God."
[44:16] And you got to be willing to do that.
[44:18] Right? And the thing is, you might trick
[44:20] the preacher. You might trick others,
[44:22] but you can't trick God because God is
[44:25] going to try you. If you say, "God, I'll
[44:27] go all the way." He going to try you on
[44:29] those bases.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; He'll try you on those bases. But I
[44:35] thank God that he does because
[44:38] all the trying and all of my failures,
[44:40] God just let me know I got to get that
[44:42] much deeper in them. God let you know
[44:45] through your failures, hey, that you
[44:47] ain't there yet. You got to go a little
[44:48] bit deeper. Come on. I got to do a
[44:51] little more in your life. And that's
[44:53] what it's about. But what it is, people
[44:55] want they they want salvation without
[44:57] change. Right? They think they get in
[45:00] the kingdom without without a born again
[45:02] experience. But when even Nicodemus,
[45:05] Jesus told him, he said, "You must be
[45:07] born again."
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:10] It don't matter who you've been taught
[45:12] under. Don't matter how how how schooled
[45:14] and wellchooled you is, how perfect and
[45:16] righteous you might think you are, you
[45:18] must be born again.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. He gave Peter the keys. But he
[45:23] told Peter also, he he he says that um
[45:26] Peter, I prayed for you. Yeah. That your
[45:29] faith fail you not. He says, "But when
[45:31] you when you convert it, right? Not when
[45:34] you shout, not when you whatever you
[45:38] wanted to say, but when you converted,
[45:41] then you'll better strengthen your
[45:43] brothers. You can't get nobody strength
[45:45] when you ain't converted." Come on. Cuz
[45:47] you still need strength yourself. But I
[45:50] found I says, you know, one thing about
[45:51] Peter, I believe that when when Jesus
[45:54] was telling him that night, this will be
[45:56] the last time I eat and drink with you.
[45:58] He says, he says, cuz I'm going to be
[46:01] struck and she going to be scattered and
[46:03] all and everybody said, "We won't leave
[46:05] you." And but Peter began to say, "Lord,
[46:07] I will never deny you. I'll never leave
[46:09] you." Right? And I believe that he meant
[46:11] that in his heart.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that. He meant it in his
[46:15] heart. He said, "If I forsake you, I
[46:17] won't go." Right? But Jesus Jesus told
[46:20] him before the uh crow uh three
[46:23] times tonight, he said, "You'll deny
[46:25] that you even know me." Right? Why did
[46:27] he deny him? Because he didn't have the
[46:30] power to help him get through that
[46:32] trial.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. And know you might mean it in
[46:35] your heart, but if if the spirit of God
[46:37] ain't in your life, when that trial
[46:40] come, one of those hard trials, you'll
[46:42] turn around.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I believe that Peter even
[46:45] felt bad because the Bible says he ran
[46:48] out and wept bitterly after that, didn't
[46:50] he? But he couldn't help but to deny
[46:52] him. He couldn't help but in fear to
[46:55] turn around because he didn't have that
[46:57] boldness of the Holy Ghost.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't have what it took.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. But after the day
[47:05] of Pentecost, he had what it took,
[47:06] didn't he?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. After that upper room
[47:09] experience, then he can stand. They say,
[47:11] "Peter, didn't you deny him?" Yeah, I
[47:14] might have denied him because I was
[47:15] afraid. I didn't have what I got now.
[47:18] Hallelujah. He says, "But you know this
[47:21] is that which was spoken of by the
[47:23] prophets." Come on. And then he began to
[47:25] speak boldly and all. And then
[47:26] throughout all his life, he would, you
[47:28] know, him and especially Paul would talk
[47:31] about how I'm a prisoner of the Lord,
[47:33] how I'm the least of all brethren, how I
[47:35] ain't nothing without God. Right? So
[47:38] what it is, you know, that's that's the
[47:40] that's when you know a man has gotten in
[47:43] contact with God when he sees himself as
[47:46] nothing. But you find people that that
[47:49] still walk think, oh, they they with a
[47:52] false humility, walking saying this and
[47:54] that. But you can tell by their speech.
[47:56] They speech betray them. That they ain't
[47:58] been in that presence yet. Come on. But
[48:00] once you go in the presence of God like
[48:02] Moses, he went in that presence.
[48:05] Hallelujah. And God to tell them, I'mma
[48:07] send you. But Moses said, Lord, who am
[48:09] I?
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh? I
[48:13] can't. He saw himself so as
[48:15] insufficient. But it was the truth
[48:17] because he was 80 years old. He was weak
[48:19] now. Right? So he saw himself as that.
[48:22] And that's what God see when God comes
[48:24] in your life when real conviction set
[48:27] in. Come on. You'll see yourself as God.
[48:30] I ain't nothing. I don't matter how
[48:32] smart I am, how well-dressed I am, who
[48:36] my family is. God, I need your help.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need you to save me.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; And I don't need to just come to church,
[48:43] but God, I need the Holy Ghost. I need
[48:46] the quickening power because there's
[48:48] going to be some storms that come, some
[48:50] trials that come, and I'm afraid of
[48:52] them.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. Like Jacob, he knew that he had
[48:56] to meet Esau that next day.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; So what he did when he knew he had to
[48:59] meet Esau, he wasn't just satisfied.
[49:02] Come on, with nothing. But he said, "I
[49:05] ain't going to let you go till you bless
[49:06] me."
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Because I got a trial tomorrow. I got a
[49:10] hard trial tomorrow. And I'm afraid of
[49:13] Esau. I don't know what he going to do.
[49:14] But God, I know I need a blessing.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I ain't going to let you
[49:19] go. I'mma rustle. My hip get out of
[49:21] joint, I'm still going to wrestle. If my
[49:23] arm broke, I'mma still rustle. No matter
[49:26] how tired I am, I'mma rustle. When I
[49:28] can't wrestle no more, I'mma hold on to
[49:30] your garment. You can kick me, try to
[49:33] shake me off, but I ain't going to let
[49:34] go until you bless me,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Until I get what I need from you.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; We need people like that today.
[49:42] Hallelujah. that ain't satisfied with
[49:45] just coming to church, but they said,
[49:47] "God, I want change in my life. Lord, I
[49:50] need help because I know that if you
[49:52] don't help me, I might have turned the
[49:54] leaf, but tomorrow I'll be right back
[49:56] where I came from or the next year or
[49:58] the next year." But God when God comes
[50:01] in your soul and he's sitting on a
[50:04] throne of your heart, come what may,
[50:06] mama leave, daddy leave, children,
[50:09] husband, wife, whatever might go. Job
[50:11] failure, you out there all alone.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And the devil even might tell you that
[50:16] God ain't ain't with you. And look at
[50:18] how you doing for God and he done left
[50:20] you. But when he's sitting on the throne
[50:22] of your heart, something will rise up
[50:24] and say that he'll never leave you nor
[50:26] forsake me. He's still here right now.
[50:29] Devil, I don't care what you say. I
[50:32] don't care what you putting on my life.
[50:34] It don't matter. I'mma wait until my
[50:36] change come. I'm going wait until God
[50:39] show up because I know he'll show up.
[50:42] How I know he'll show up because he
[50:44] promised in his word that he would.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And that's what we need today.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what's missing.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Just good church.
[50:56] happy, playing, singing. Where is the
[50:59] change?
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. We need change. Hallelujah. We
[51:04] need sinners to come to repentance.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; It was like John the Baptist when he
[51:08] came out, he had a message from God. And
[51:12] his message was God was repent because
[51:14] the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[51:16] Whether you're a Pharisee, whether
[51:18] you're a scribe, whether you're a
[51:20] Sadducee, don't think yourself, oh, I'm
[51:23] in this church. I go, come on. that God
[51:25] can take these stones up.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't think the church running
[51:30] just because you here, you leave
[51:32] tomorrow, God will fill it right back
[51:34] up.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because he don't got no
[51:36] respective person. God used whoever he
[51:39] want to use. But I'm glad tonight that
[51:42] God thought about using me. Hallelujah.
[51:44] Oh, a person that wasn't nobody. Person
[51:47] that wasn't nothing. But I'm so glad
[51:49] that God thought about me. Hallelujah.
[51:52] And I want to walk before God. Whether
[51:53] it's just holding the door, whether it's
[51:55] just praying for the sick, whether it's
[51:57] just standing in the gap, whatever it
[51:59] is, it's a great thing to be in the
[52:01] kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. But it's a great deception.
[52:08] Come on.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Today, come on. It's a great deception.
[52:13] But the thing about it is people will
[52:15] find out one day that what they had
[52:17] didn't work.
[52:20] You'll find out one day. Right. Samson
[52:23] depended on his strength most of the
[52:26] time cuz he gave God his strength, but
[52:28] he gave the lil his heart, didn't he?
[52:30] Come on.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; He depended on just because I'm a
[52:33] Nazarite, just because I'm this and it
[52:35] it might have been true, right?
[52:38] But he was playing with the devil,
[52:40] wasn't he? when he was up there. I
[52:43] always think about how the scripture
[52:44] says he was when he was up there with
[52:46] Delilah, she had men in the chamber
[52:49] lying in wait at at the time that she
[52:52] called him to come bind him. He up there
[52:55] playing around, but it's devils waiting
[52:57] to come get you. And that's what people
[53:00] think today. I'm a Nazerite. I go to
[53:02] church. I'm That's So, but you playing
[53:04] around. Come on. It's only the grace of
[53:07] God that nothing ain't bad ain't happen
[53:09] yet. It's only the grace of God that you
[53:11] ain't fall off yet. Right? But while you
[53:14] playing around, the devil got demons in
[53:16] reserve. All he's waiting on is the God
[53:18] to move his hand off your life. All he's
[53:21] waiting on is the grace to leave. And
[53:23] then he'll come bind you up. He'll take
[53:26] you to depths that you thought you'll
[53:27] never go. He'll take your mind. Come on.
[53:31] He'll take your body.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; He'll destroy your whole life, put you
[53:35] on drugs because the devil don't care
[53:37] nothing about you. All he come to do is
[53:39] kill,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; steal, and destroy. That's all.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; But Samson went out and say, "I shake
[53:47] myself as other times." But he ain't
[53:48] know that God wasn't with him, right?
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. He wasn't ready for the
[53:53] challenge at that hour, was he?
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. But to get back to it, what did
[53:58] he have to do? Find his way down that
[54:00] lonely road of repentance.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:04] He had to find his way down that lonely
[54:06] road. Said, "How's a lonely road?" Cuz I
[54:08] ain't even got my eyes this time. Come
[54:11] on. I'm a man weak. Can't get around.
[54:15] They had a little little lad leading
[54:16] them around. Right. Come on. But
[54:21] even though he had his eyes, I believe
[54:23] he still had tears flowing some kind of
[54:25] way because what got him was the
[54:28] memories, right, of the anointing.
[54:32] the memories
[54:34] of how God used to use them, right? And
[54:37] that ought to get somebody today. If you
[54:40] ever been in the presence of God and the
[54:42] power, the memories ought to get you.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; When you when you just get relaxed and
[54:47] cold, the memories out to do something
[54:48] to you
[54:50] to shake you and say, "Lord, I once more
[54:53] strengthen me again. Come on. Once more
[54:56] send your anointing, Lord. I don't want
[54:59] to just be a regular person. God, a
[55:01] regular church. Just paraphrasing. I
[55:03] don't want to be that. But God is is no,
[55:05] he just a regular church. But what made
[55:08] the difference was when the anointing
[55:10] was there
[55:11] &gt;&gt; when he can reach back and fill those
[55:13] locks
[55:14] &gt;&gt; and God would confirm the covenant that
[55:17] he made with him. Hallelujah. And the
[55:20] anointing come and nothing couldn't
[55:21] stand before him. Right? And that's how
[55:24] it is today. He said, "Upon this rock
[55:26] I'll build my church and the gates of
[55:28] hell can't stand against her." Reason
[55:30] why things are going on. Come on. You
[55:32] got to What are you standing on? What
[55:34] are you built on?
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:38] What What's your rock?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; What's your rock?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I believe Brother K was preaching on a
[55:45] rock. I listened to him the other day.
[55:47] What's your rock?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; What are you standing on? Come on. And
[55:52] that's the truth. What are you standing
[55:54] on? Because if it's anything else
[55:56] besides the word of God, it's shifting
[55:58] sand.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; If you building on anything else outside
[56:02] of the word of God, come on. We was
[56:04] preaching the other week. He says the
[56:06] rains came, the winds blew, the floods
[56:09] descended. You might make it through the
[56:11] rains. You might make it through the
[56:12] winds. You might make it through the
[56:14] floods, but when the earthquake come,
[56:16] come on. I want something that that'll
[56:19] take me through everything.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. I want something that's going
[56:23] to take me through all the storms. Might
[56:25] see that storm coming. Hallelujah. Might
[56:28] feel like I all the storm is coming. I
[56:30] wish it wouldn't come. But nevertheless,
[56:33] that's what God raised us up for.
[56:35] Hallelujah. That's why he prepared us
[56:38] for that's why we've been in prayer.
[56:40] That's why we've been consecrating for
[56:42] times like these. Hallelujah. That's why
[56:44] we got oil in our in our lamp and in our
[56:47] vessel because in the midnight hour for
[56:49] time we we we do that for the midnight
[56:51] hour. Hallelujah. So when you got to go
[56:54] out and fight, you can see your way.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can see my way through
[56:59] this trial. I can see my way through
[57:01] this situation. I can see my way through
[57:03] this crisis. Come on. Because of the
[57:06] oil. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. But
[57:10] I say it's a great great deception. you
[57:12] know that we find today I says but what
[57:14] it is and that's the thing uh uh uh
[57:17] Jesus like was saying even when Jesus
[57:20] came and his message was he says the
[57:23] spirit of the lord is upon me cuz he
[57:25] anointed me to preach the gospel but
[57:27] then after that he says repent because
[57:29] the kingdom of heaven is at hand right
[57:31] John the baptist not John the Baptist
[57:33] but Peter on the day of Pentecost they
[57:35] said men and brethren what shall we do
[57:37] what was his first message repent right
[57:40] come on and be baptized in the name of
[57:42] the Lord of Jesus Christ for
[57:44] remissioning your sins and then it
[57:46] didn't stop there though. People think
[57:49] that's where it stopped. That's not
[57:50] where it stopped. That's not the resting
[57:53] place. Come on. But but he said you
[57:56] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[57:58] Ghost. Not nothing that you got to work
[58:00] for, but it's a promise that God gave
[58:02] you. Hallelujah. It's a promise, ain't
[58:06] it? Come on. But it's a great deception.
[58:08] People thinking that if I work to work,
[58:10] they might not say it from their lips,
[58:12] but their very action, the way they move
[58:14] in their life, they think they got some
[58:16] entitlement. Come on. But that ain't
[58:19] works like that ain't going to entitle
[58:20] you. You got to have representation by
[58:23] predestination anyway. Come on. But what
[58:26] it is,
[58:28] the Holy Ghost got to come down and
[58:30] strike the seed. That's right.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. Something got to click in your
[58:34] heart.
[58:36] Something got to change on the inside.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; You got to hear the voice. Hallelujah.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Say, did you hear it? Nobody heard. I
[58:43] heard a voice.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And it said, "Come out of her."
[58:46] Hallelujah.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. But what it is, because we my
[58:51] wife was telling me the other day about
[58:52] something and I says, you know, when it
[58:55] dealing with the church, right? I said,
[58:57] you know, all these Protestant churches
[58:58] and things, they came out of the of the
[59:01] Catholic church, right? At some point,
[59:04] you know, we was talking about mystery
[59:06] Babylon a little bit and and and the
[59:08] great the mother. Come on. She's the
[59:10] mother, right? The mother of harlot. She
[59:12] had daughters, right? And those harlots
[59:15] is going to do the same thing their mama
[59:16] did, right? From the very beginning.
[59:18] They might not, but just like after had
[59:20] to do the same thing her mama did,
[59:22] right? Because that's she did the same
[59:25] thing her mama did. Went after and and
[59:27] ba worship and all those things, right?
[59:29] Persecuting the people of God. And even
[59:32] though the the churches might have came
[59:34] out even uh I I can't say say it the way
[59:37] I want to say it but they come out do
[59:39] all the right things but I want to say
[59:41] one thing about it. It's still the
[59:43] spirit lingering around there. Come on.
[59:47] And if you don't watch it you can't help
[59:49] it. They can't help it but to set
[59:51] themselves up right and to do the same
[59:54] thing that the mama did. How many
[59:55] believe that?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; They got You see that? And the thing
[1:00:00] about it is I was I was telling
[1:00:02] Charlotte when we was talking about
[1:00:03] something I said we can see it so clear,
[1:00:06] right? Only reason why is cuz God opened
[1:00:09] our eyes.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's people that's affiliated with
[1:00:13] the same word and they can't see it.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not that you understand it
[1:00:20] intellectually, but God, you know, the
[1:00:23] Pharisees and all that, they had the
[1:00:24] scrolls, the scribe, I mean, uh, the
[1:00:26] scrolls, they had the, they knew the
[1:00:28] prophecies of old. They knew what was to
[1:00:30] come, right? But when they asked John,
[1:00:32] "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the voice
[1:00:34] of one crying in the wilderness." He was
[1:00:36] the word made flesh at that time,
[1:00:39] standing before him, say, "How was he
[1:00:40] the word made flesh?" Cuz he was the
[1:00:42] living word. He was the He was the
[1:00:43] scriptures that come alive standing
[1:00:46] before them. the prophecy that was to
[1:00:48] come. But even though they had the
[1:00:50] scrolls, even though they might have
[1:00:52] preached it, even though they might have
[1:00:53] quoted it when it stood before them,
[1:00:55] they still couldn't see it.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And it came exactly how the Bible said
[1:01:02] it would have came,
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same thing today.
[1:01:06] Right. That woman at the well, she saw
[1:01:09] more than all the Pharisees did. Right?
[1:01:13] Because she knew the scriptures. We know
[1:01:15] when the Messiah come, he'll do these
[1:01:16] things, right? He told her how he
[1:01:20] because they were she were looking for
[1:01:21] something. But then her eyes was open,
[1:01:23] wasn't it? Those on the way to Emmas,
[1:01:26] Jesus was talking, walking with them,
[1:01:28] they didn't know who he was, did they?
[1:01:30] But but but it was something about what
[1:01:32] he was preaching to them. Hallelujah. It
[1:01:36] was something about what he was teaching
[1:01:38] them that caused a burning in their
[1:01:41] hearts. Right? They said, "Did not our
[1:01:43] hearts do what?" burn in us.
[1:01:46] The word when it's preached effectively,
[1:01:49] it ought to burn in somebody's heart. It
[1:01:52] ought to cause somebody to be searching
[1:01:54] theirelves and say, "Lord, I need it.
[1:01:57] God, I want it."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. It ought to burn
[1:02:02] in their hearts. But it says, "Didn't
[1:02:04] our hearts burn within us?" But the
[1:02:06] thing is, even though they they were
[1:02:08] they knew the scriptures and all that,
[1:02:10] but still took God opening their eyes,
[1:02:13] right? When they got in the house, he
[1:02:15] asked for bread. He did something. And
[1:02:17] the Bible says, "And when they eyes were
[1:02:19] open, right? Come on. People can be
[1:02:23] affiliated with the church, but your
[1:02:24] eyes got to be opened."
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:02:30] Your eyes got to be open.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. He that has an ear, let him
[1:02:35] hear. Right? If you got eyes, you need
[1:02:38] to see. But the only thing that's going
[1:02:39] to give you the ability to hear is the
[1:02:42] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Nothing else.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care how smart you is
[1:02:47] intellectual, you can't hear without the
[1:02:50] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight?
[1:02:54] It's the truth. What does when the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost come in, he is a lifecher.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. You ain't got to worry about
[1:03:02] that person no more. He cleaning them
[1:03:04] up.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; You preach the word conviction setting
[1:03:07] in. They conforming to what they hear.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:03:13] them.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; He's changing me from glory to glory.
[1:03:17] He's changing me. He's working on me in
[1:03:20] the morning. He's working on me every
[1:03:23] day. Hallelujah. I thank God for working
[1:03:27] on us. Chip away, God. Shape me, God.
[1:03:30] Make me, God. Mold me. Change me to what
[1:03:33] you want me to be. Is that what you want
[1:03:35] tonight?
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I was talking, brother Damon. I was
[1:03:39] talking about some things. I said, man,
[1:03:41] you know, is is it hurt your heart
[1:03:44] because uh see a person or whatever been
[1:03:47] doing that same thing for 30 years,
[1:03:51] right?
[1:03:54] They still come to church faithfully,
[1:03:56] still do this, that faithfully, but
[1:03:58] could have been 30 years, right?
[1:04:02] Something or But what it is, come on.
[1:04:06] Change got to come.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But if you're sold to an ideology, you
[1:04:10] think you're all right.
[1:04:14] All have seen it come short of the
[1:04:15] glory. That's your comfort zone, right?
[1:04:18] I don't want to settle with that.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah. I want to settle with God.
[1:04:22] You said, "Be ye perfect as your father
[1:04:24] in heaven is also perfect." Right? Come
[1:04:27] on. I know we've all sinned, but God,
[1:04:29] I'm on my knees
[1:04:31] asking you to help me.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Change me.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Fill me again.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Set me on fire again.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; If I'm drifting, send something out
[1:04:45] there to bring me back.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That ought to be your cry from the pull
[1:04:51] pit to the back. No,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; that's the truth.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; From the top to the bottom.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; But when you're sold to some ideology,
[1:04:59] your soul this is all right. You don't
[1:05:01] need Come on. Jesus told them by your
[1:05:05] traditions, you made the word of God
[1:05:07] effect to the people.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. You robbed the power from the
[1:05:13] people.
[1:05:14] You took away from the people the thing
[1:05:17] that was going to clean them up.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You took away the hope from the people
[1:05:22] by your traditions.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. Who bewitched you? Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] But the Holy Ghost come back to give us
[1:05:30] hope.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. When he shines the light, you
[1:05:34] see the darkness then or you see exactly
[1:05:37] the condition you in. That's what we
[1:05:40] need today. How many believe that
[1:05:42] tonight? Come on. But it's a great
[1:05:44] deception, right? I says what it is. You
[1:05:48] know, God God's calling. How many
[1:05:50] believe that?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; But I know one thing. Like the scripture
[1:05:54] says, "Straight is the gate and
[1:05:55] narrowest way." Right? I was talking
[1:05:57] with a friend of mine last night and and
[1:06:00] uh he been he been going through some
[1:06:02] things at work for a couple last couple
[1:06:04] days and uh a certain situation, but
[1:06:09] he's real he's real religious, right?
[1:06:13] and
[1:06:15] real religious.
[1:06:17] But I told him I says that situation I
[1:06:22] says you know what that person want to
[1:06:25] make peace with you.
[1:06:28] that person want to make peace with you
[1:06:31] because they came and they acknowledge
[1:06:32] their faults but they can't approach you
[1:06:35] but they come to me and say hey cuz I
[1:06:37] helped them resolve some issues before
[1:06:40] and I talked to the person I said now
[1:06:43] you're the religious one I shouldn't
[1:06:46] have to talk to you about forgiveness
[1:06:49] right shouldn't have to
[1:06:52] talk to you about
[1:06:54] it don't matter if they did you wrong I
[1:06:57] shouldn't have to talk to you about
[1:06:58] forgiveness, right? Or about love or
[1:07:01] making things right. I said, "You go
[1:07:04] home and pray. Pray about it today and
[1:07:08] we'll talk tomorrow." But he came back
[1:07:11] the next day with a worse attitude than
[1:07:12] they need the first day.
[1:07:15] And I said, "See, that's what it is."
[1:07:17] You know, a lot of people in church are
[1:07:21] the same way.
[1:07:24] They'll jump. They'll shout. They
[1:07:26] profess the Lord, profess their Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost fil, but they'll hold something.
[1:07:31] They don't want nothing to do with
[1:07:32] people. They want nothing to do with
[1:07:33] them like that. Well, I want to say you
[1:07:35] can't get in the kingdom of God that
[1:07:37] way.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz if you don't forgive, you
[1:07:40] won't be forgiven.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; But you don't know how they did me. They
[1:07:44] ain't did you no worse than they did
[1:07:45] Jesus.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; They ain't did you no worse than that.
[1:07:51] Come on. But if the Holy Ghost is in
[1:07:53] you, that's what it is. If you if it's
[1:07:56] just regular church for you, you can do
[1:07:57] that. But I don't know. I says I says,
[1:08:00] you know, that's what it is. He's got to
[1:08:03] something's got to change you. You know,
[1:08:06] you've got to be changed
[1:08:09] and then it won't be a struggle, right?
[1:08:11] Things might catch you unaware, but the
[1:08:13] Holy Ghost inside you, he knows how to
[1:08:16] calm you on down.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. He knows how to bring you back
[1:08:20] to reality.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost knows how to humble
[1:08:23] you down
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and then let you know, look, you out of
[1:08:27] place.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. You need to repent.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You need to say, I'm sorry.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You need to make it right. Quit blaming
[1:08:36] everybody else.
[1:08:38] The Holy Ghost know how to do that.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. But you got to listen. You You
[1:08:43] got to listen. You I don't Come on. But
[1:08:46] I was I was saying me and another friend
[1:08:47] of mine was talking. I said the thing
[1:08:49] about it is when when you hold stuff
[1:08:52] like that, you got high blood pressure,
[1:08:55] you got heart issues, you really a sick
[1:08:58] individual, right? But look at the stuff
[1:09:01] you holding. You let that stuff go and
[1:09:04] live in the liberty of God. You might
[1:09:06] feel better.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. I know you will feel better.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I know you will. But long as you've got
[1:09:13] that there, you get you you left a gate
[1:09:16] open for the enemy to come in. Right.
[1:09:19] And I I was saying, you know, uh in
[1:09:20] closing, I was saying uh uh Joshua knows
[1:09:24] they they can look back at all the great
[1:09:27] victories they won
[1:09:30] and the power they knew that that God
[1:09:33] was all powerful. And the blessed thing
[1:09:34] was when Moses was gone, the scriptures,
[1:09:38] God come to Joshua
[1:09:41] and said, "Moses, my servant is dead."
[1:09:45] But God ain't dead. He's still here.
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; He used Moses in a mighty way.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But he told him Moses is what? Dead.
[1:09:55] Right. He says, "But as I was with
[1:09:58] Moses," come on. So I'm going to be with
[1:10:02] who? You. Come on. But I want you to
[1:10:05] walk in my ways.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you do," he said, "It won't
[1:10:08] be a man to be able to stand before you.
[1:10:10] Every place the soul of your foot uh
[1:10:12] tread upon, I'mma give to you. It's
[1:10:14] yours." Right? But when they got the the
[1:10:17] the a uh AI right and they flew they
[1:10:20] flee before the Lord. I mean, flee
[1:10:23] before the people, right? I see Joshua
[1:10:25] and them going and crying and praying,
[1:10:28] Lord, what's going on? Cuz I know you
[1:10:30] all powerful. All the victories you won
[1:10:32] and we come against this small group.
[1:10:35] That's why we didn't send but a few
[1:10:36] people out there and they chased us.
[1:10:39] God, what's wrong? But God, it was
[1:10:42] nothing wrong with him. Right?
[1:10:44] I was just paraphrasing it. He said,
[1:10:46] "You left the gate open, didn't you? and
[1:10:50] the enemy come in and and they can't
[1:10:52] both sit on the throne at the same time.
[1:10:55] So I I I I I'll be right here waiting
[1:10:57] for you to get in repentance. I'll be
[1:10:59] right here waiting on you, right, to go
[1:11:02] make that ride. Search the camp. Come
[1:11:06] on. Search your heart tonight. Search
[1:11:09] your life. Search your home. Come on.
[1:11:13] Search it out and watch what God do.
[1:11:16] Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
