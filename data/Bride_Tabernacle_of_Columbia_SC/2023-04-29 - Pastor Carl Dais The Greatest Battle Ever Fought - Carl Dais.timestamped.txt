[33:44] as we stand tonight
[33:47] Book of Esther
[33:50] 4.
[33:52] Esther 4 and 13.
[33:55] kind of in the middle of my
[33:57] sermon here
[33:59] started on last Sunday
[34:02] Esther 4 and 13.
[34:09] you have it say Amen
[34:13] then Mordecai
[34:15] commanded to answer Esther
[34:18] think not with thyself that thou shall
[34:21] escape the King's house
[34:24] more than all the Jews
[34:27] for if thou all together hold this thy
[34:30] peace at this time
[34:32] then share their enlargement and
[34:35] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[34:38] another place
[34:40] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[34:43] destroyed
[34:44] and who who knoweth whether Thou Art
[34:48] come to the kingdom for such a time as
[34:52] this
[34:53] may the Lord add a blessing to The
[34:55] Originals which you may be seated
[34:57] for who knoweth whether Thou Art come to
[35:02] the kingdom for such a time as this
[35:06] amen
[35:08] appreciate each and every one of you to
[35:10] press your way out tonight
[35:12] for such a time as this our thought
[35:15] tonight the greatest battle ever fought
[35:17] we want to deal with the mind
[35:21] and I was God kind of moved me off it a
[35:24] little bit I'm going to the unveiling of
[35:26] God but I want to work with the mind now
[35:28] because it's been a few weeks the mind
[35:31] the greatest battle ever fought is
[35:32] faulty in our mind so Mordecai began to
[35:35] tell
[35:37] Esther you in the King's house and you
[35:40] think you're going to escape
[35:42] this wrath that Haman have put upon them
[35:45] that the king signed and sealed it with
[35:48] his own ring that they will destroy the
[35:50] Jews in 27 provinces but he said and
[35:53] then look what Esther's began to say she
[35:56] said that uh
[35:58] then Esther made them returned to
[36:02] Mordecai this answer
[36:05] go and gather together all the Jews that
[36:08] are president shushan shushan and fast
[36:12] for me and neither eat nor drink three
[36:15] days or nights
[36:18] and I also in my meetings were fast
[36:21] likewise and so will I go into the King
[36:24] which is not according to the law and if
[36:27] I perish I perish
[36:29] so tonight we're looking at coming to
[36:32] the kingdom for such a time as this
[36:35] you know the devil is Raging and we want
[36:39] to look at the the three elements of the
[36:41] of the of the greatest battle ever
[36:43] fought we we we're dealing with the body
[36:45] when we know the sea taste here smell
[36:49] feel
[36:50] and the illness to the spirit
[36:52] imagination conscience memory reason and
[36:55] affection but down in that Soul realm we
[36:59] want to deal with that and we want to
[37:00] kind of interchange it with the mind
[37:02] because Proverbs say out of the
[37:04] abundance of the heart the mouth begin
[37:06] to speak so everything that's in your
[37:08] heart you're going to speak it out so in
[37:12] there is only free Mall agency which
[37:14] means you believe the word or you doubt
[37:16] it and the Holy Spirit has to come in
[37:19] there for you to hold to that word so
[37:23] when you hold to that word from your
[37:25] soul your heart as the prophet of God
[37:27] said down in this heart there's a little
[37:29] compartment about the size of a quarter
[37:32] and that's where you think from that's
[37:34] where you believe from that's you that's
[37:37] the real you tonight
[37:39] and that's what believes the word you
[37:42] believe it from your heart and if the
[37:44] holy spirit is not there you will have
[37:46] you won't be able to believe you begin
[37:48] to think you have faith that presumes
[37:51] but it won't be genuine faith that
[37:54] stands alone and say it's my victory
[37:59] Chronicles 28.
[38:06] Chronicles First Chronicles 28 and 9.
[38:13] and he said thou Solomon my son knew
[38:18] thou
[38:19] know thou the god of thy father and
[38:22] serve him with the perfect heart
[38:26] and with a willing mind
[38:29] a perfect heart and a willing mind
[38:34] for the Lord searches all the hearts and
[38:38] understandeth all the imaginations of
[38:40] the thoughts
[38:42] for if thou seek Him He will be found of
[38:46] thee but if thou forsake Him He will
[38:49] cast thee
[38:51] off forever so when you begin to look at
[38:54] God you seeking god with your whole
[38:57] heart tonight and the devil knows each
[39:01] and every one of us if we believe the
[39:03] word he knows each and every one of us
[39:05] if we're going to stand on his word
[39:07] tonight and dealing with the heart God
[39:10] Mercy tonight
[39:12] we got to know who we are
[39:15] you know your brother called me this
[39:17] morning
[39:18] he said brother Carl we had such a good
[39:20] bible study on last Saturday
[39:23] at work today
[39:25] and he said the lady
[39:27] her niece said she don't want us to come
[39:29] back I told sister Keisha
[39:32] her mom looked like in such a great
[39:34] condition she said we want to hold off
[39:37] from y'all coming back to Bible study
[39:39] because it's such a presence of God was
[39:41] in there because it was so so much
[39:43] humility seeing her in her condition
[39:45] that God was doing something
[39:48] so when people see that you focus on
[39:51] what God is wanting to do with you then
[39:54] sometimes they want to back up and say I
[39:55] don't want to do this I don't want to do
[39:57] that we said nothing to her about how to
[39:59] live or nothing but she got as brother
[40:02] Johnny said today she got a little
[40:03] scared a little fearful I said we're
[40:05] coming in the name of the Lord
[40:07] so the greatest battle of a fault now in
[40:10] your Minds tonight you know whether you
[40:13] want to serve God or not you know
[40:15] whether you want to continue with God or
[40:17] not in your heart tonight you know
[40:19] whether the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[40:22] there tonight and you want to go on with
[40:24] God tonight see in our minds we plead
[40:27] with God sometimes
[40:30] in our heart we plead with God that God
[40:33] I'm just going to church with my parents
[40:35] I'm just going to church with my husband
[40:37] or my wife but you know in the inside
[40:40] whether you want to serve God or not you
[40:43] know from the inside of the inside that
[40:46] God I love you God I'm going to
[40:48] surrender to you God I'm going to trust
[40:51] you and I'm going to take you at your
[40:52] word and when you believe like that God
[40:55] can't do nothing but bless you
[40:59] first Samuel
[41:03] we're gonna look at some a man here that
[41:05] really had the heart of God
[41:08] and when he got the heart of God no
[41:10] demons or no Devils can stand in his way
[41:13] because that man heart has been cemented
[41:16] into the kingdom of God's presence
[41:20] first Samuel
[41:24] 17.
[41:26] and eight
[41:30] and he stood and cried until the armies
[41:32] of Israel and said unto them
[41:38] why are you come out to set
[41:42] your battle in a raid
[41:44] am I not a Philistine and ye the
[41:47] Servants of Saul
[41:49] choose you a man
[41:51] for you
[41:52] and let him come down to me
[41:56] if he be able to fight with me and to
[41:59] kill me
[42:00] then will we be your servants but if I
[42:03] Prevail against him and kill him then
[42:06] shall ye be our servants and serve us
[42:11] and the Philistine said I defy the
[42:13] armies of the of Israel this day give me
[42:16] a man that we may fight together
[42:20] and when Saul and all of Israel heard
[42:23] these words of the Philistine they were
[42:26] dismayed and greatly afraid
[42:29] see when he heard what the Philistines
[42:31] said they were dismayed and greatly
[42:34] afraid
[42:35] see God knows tonight whether you want
[42:37] to go all the way with him
[42:39] he knows tonight whether you just
[42:42] Venture without Authority or you come
[42:44] genuinely God I want to serve you God I
[42:47] want to thank you God I want to bless
[42:50] you God I want to do these things now
[42:51] let's go to verse 20.
[42:53] and David rules up early in the morning
[42:55] and left the Sheep
[42:57] with the keeper and took and went as
[43:02] Jesse commanded him
[43:03] and he came to the trench as the host
[43:06] was going forth
[43:09] to fight and shout it for the battle
[43:12] for Israel and the Philistines had put
[43:14] the battle in a ray Army against Army
[43:17] and David left his carriage in the hand
[43:20] of The Keeper of the carriage and ran
[43:22] into the army and came and saluted his
[43:25] brother
[43:26] and as he talked with them behold there
[43:30] came up the champion Philistine of gav
[43:33] Goliath by name out of the armies of the
[43:35] Philistines and speak according to the
[43:38] same words and David heard it
[43:41] now see he did this 40 days
[43:44] but David heard him
[43:46] that day
[43:49] see the devil is telling you he got
[43:50] control of you every day in and out I'm
[43:53] making you do what I want you to do I
[43:55] got control of your life I keep you mean
[43:58] I keep you angry I keep you perplexed I
[44:00] keep you despair I got control of you
[44:04] but this day there was a man of God
[44:06] he heard filled the Philistines what he
[44:10] said and David heard him now look what
[44:12] he says
[44:14] and all the men of Israel when they saw
[44:16] the man fled from him
[44:18] and was so afraid
[44:21] and the men of Israel said have ye seen
[44:24] this man that has come up
[44:26] surely to divide defy Israel he is come
[44:29] up and it shall be that the man who
[44:32] killeth him the king will enrich him
[44:35] with great riches and will give him his
[44:37] daughter and make his father's house
[44:39] free in Israel
[44:41] I said Lord
[44:43] where are we going
[44:45] what we doing Lord
[44:47] we got to do more than what we used to
[44:49] do
[44:51] I said Lord I begin to pray and as we
[44:54] had the ministers meeting on Tuesday
[44:56] the law said we got to do more I heard
[44:58] the pastor say about humility and I said
[45:01] Lord that's where we got to be
[45:04] so the Lord said you just got to pray
[45:05] not an hour you just got to pray until
[45:07] I'm finished with you praying if it's
[45:09] two hours three hours early in the
[45:11] morning God you got to pray see we
[45:13] trying to get somewhere with God and God
[45:16] has to see a certain faith in our lives
[45:18] and then he can come on the scene and
[45:21] begin to meet our requests
[45:24] sometimes it's three four hours of
[45:26] prayer early in the morning in the
[45:27] middle of the night he wake you up and
[45:29] pray it's got to come to a point that
[45:32] we're doing more than what we are doing
[45:33] we just can't stay where we act it stay
[45:37] on me where we at we got to do more than
[45:39] we're doing for God for God to come on
[45:42] the scene I told his sisters on Saturday
[45:44] I said now we can create the right
[45:46] atmosphere God only comes when the
[45:50] atmosphere is created and when the
[45:52] atmosphere is created then God comes on
[45:55] the scene and he lets us know that he's
[45:58] pleased with our worship
[46:00] God told me an hour that might not be
[46:02] enough for you
[46:04] two hours it might not be enough
[46:07] where were we going are we just church
[46:09] people every morning sometimes I'm
[46:12] riding on the road
[46:13] I passed by the BP gas station and I see
[46:17] the Jehovah Witness out there eight
[46:19] o'clock in the morning in the middle of
[46:21] the morning eight o'clock to 12 in the
[46:23] ball and he passing out tracks and
[46:25] flyers and the Lord said now what you
[46:27] doing
[46:28] rebuke me I'm driving what you doing for
[46:31] the Lord
[46:32] if the denominations can do that what
[46:34] can we do
[46:36] God is looking for more from us not the
[46:39] things of the world yes it's good to go
[46:41] to school it's good to get a good job
[46:43] yes it's good to have a nice house and a
[46:45] nice car but what are you going to do
[46:46] with this Jesus that's called Christ
[46:48] he's on your hands tonight
[46:50] what are you going to do with him
[46:52] tonight I said God help me to cry out
[46:54] but most of all helped me to get on my
[46:56] knees that I can see God yes you got
[46:59] preachers doing all kind of stuff
[47:01] running here and there doing all kinds
[47:03] of but God what you want me to do show
[47:05] me what you want me to do God and let me
[47:07] get in that atmosphere and that please
[47:10] that I can be used of you Lord
[47:14] I told the brothers at the church I said
[47:16] let's pray from 8 30 to 10 30. every
[47:19] Saturday
[47:21] I said Lord we got to get somewhere if
[47:24] you want God to do something
[47:27] you want God to do something for you you
[47:29] got to get along you don't have to talk
[47:31] to nobody get along by yourself in your
[47:34] secret closet and say God I need a fresh
[47:36] out point of the holy ghost in my life
[47:39] God lord I just don't feel the anointing
[47:41] like I used to feel it when I witness
[47:43] and I preach but Lord it takes something
[47:45] else God said you got to do more than
[47:47] what you used to do if the enemy if if
[47:49] the Bible says gross Darkness has come
[47:52] upon the Earth and gross Darkness upon
[47:55] the people that means you got to shine
[47:57] even brighter
[47:58] so that means you got to do even more to
[48:01] let God know that you uh please you he's
[48:04] pleased with your worship
[48:10] God is looking for us to do more
[48:14] we'll read something here I read to the
[48:15] church
[48:16] that inspired me
[48:19] one of these books brother Simmons gave
[48:21] me
[48:22] amen
[48:24] The constraining Power of Love
[48:27] must be in the preacher
[48:29] as a projecting eccentric and all
[48:33] commanding self
[48:35] oblivious Force
[48:38] the energy of self-denial must be his
[48:41] being
[48:43] his heart
[48:45] and blood and bones
[48:47] must go forth as a man among men clothed
[48:53] with humility
[48:55] abiding in meekness
[48:58] wise as a serpent harmless as a dog
[49:01] the bonds of his servant
[49:04] with the spirit of a king
[49:08] a king in high
[49:10] Royal independent bearing with the
[49:13] Simplicity and sweetness of a child
[49:18] the preacher must throw
[49:20] himself with all abandonment
[49:23] of a perfect
[49:24] self-empting faith
[49:27] and a self-consuming zeal
[49:30] into his work for the Salvation of men
[49:34] let me read that again
[49:36] and it's self-consuming zeal
[49:39] into his work for the Salvation of men
[49:43] heartily heroic compassionate Fearless
[49:47] models must be the men
[49:49] be who take hold of and shape a
[49:53] generation for God
[49:56] if they be
[49:58] timid time Seekers
[50:01] Place Seekers
[50:03] if they be men Pleasers or men fear us
[50:06] if their faith has a weak hold on God or
[50:10] his word if their denial be broken by
[50:13] any phase of self and the world they
[50:16] cannot take hold of the church nor the
[50:19] word
[50:22] I said Lord I Thank you
[50:25] sometimes I have to say things
[50:28] on Sunday morning that I I don't want to
[50:30] say
[50:32] but it's to get the people right
[50:34] I said I didn't come down here by your
[50:36] inspiration
[50:38] just to start a fellowship
[50:40] but God if one soul is saved for your
[50:43] kingdom
[50:44] I've done the work that you've called me
[50:46] to do
[50:48] God said you got to get on your knees
[50:49] and pray
[50:51] and you got to do more than you did last
[50:53] year
[50:54] you got to do more than you did last
[50:56] week
[50:57] we got to get so close to God that God
[51:00] saved them that around us
[51:02] God begin to work I can tell you tonight
[51:05] church I had Bible study with my
[51:07] co-workers on the job
[51:10] and a few of them supposed to come
[51:12] tonight he said but pray preacher I'm
[51:14] scared to come around these Saints
[51:16] because they might jump on me he's
[51:17] because I call you the devil I call you
[51:19] busy bug he was asking me about serpent
[51:22] seed I said well this is how it goes and
[51:25] he said you ain't nothing but the devil
[51:27] I said Thank You Jesus
[51:29] I said if did God want me to be the
[51:31] devil I'd be pleased to be the devil if
[51:34] that's what he want me to be another guy
[51:36] looked to say
[51:38] I've never heard that before
[51:39] and see Jesus if you love Jesus like you
[51:43] supposed to love him no matter if he
[51:45] casts you away you're going to serve him
[51:47] and I told them I said if it wasn't a
[51:50] god living a Christian Life is better
[51:52] than living the world and earrings and
[51:55] tattoos and all this stuff hair hanging
[51:58] out your head and everything doing
[52:00] everything except for what God has
[52:02] called us to do I said you know what if
[52:04] we can't live for God God ought to just
[52:06] wipe us off the Earth right now if we
[52:08] can't live for him and praise him he
[52:09] don't need us I told the church God
[52:12] don't need us if we can't come to praise
[52:14] him he don't need if we can't come to
[52:16] worship him if we're making just a
[52:18] church denomination out of worship God
[52:21] wants to worship
[52:25] a true sign is always overlooked when
[52:28] the people of God has failed God and
[52:31] went to the world and looked for the
[52:33] form and Fashions of the ministry but
[52:35] they feel God why that true sign that
[52:38] they saw
[52:39] they didn't recognize it to be the sign
[52:42] of God
[52:44] didn't recognize it as their token they
[52:47] didn't recognize it as their garment
[52:49] their wedding garment they wrecked they
[52:51] haven't recognized the true sign that
[52:54] Jesus spoke
[52:55] behold I send you Elijah
[52:58] glory to God he didn't send him to you
[53:01] for the flesh he sent him to you for the
[53:04] spirit that you might clothe yourself in
[53:07] glory which is the baptism of the Holy
[53:09] Ghost and your mind might be the mind of
[53:12] Christ
[53:14] how you get the mind of Christ by the
[53:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the
[53:20] prophet of God said your faith cannot
[53:22] reach there in the greatest battle ever
[53:24] fought until the Holy Ghost comes and
[53:26] confirms your life in the power of God
[53:29] you don't have the faith that it needs
[53:31] to overcome the world
[53:34] he said the Holy Ghost brings that type
[53:36] of faith that is the faith which is
[53:39] perfect Faith tonight to overcome every
[53:42] circumstance and every condition
[53:44] because now you're not speaking from the
[53:46] head you're speaking from the heart
[53:48] and now God you tell the devil
[53:51] in the name of Jesus Christ you defeated
[53:54] and when you trust God like that in the
[53:57] midst of all those situations like David
[54:00] said I'll take your head off glory to
[54:02] God as Joshua began to tell son stand
[54:05] still Moon over agilon I'm gonna take
[54:08] these enemies out you got to be that
[54:10] same way yeah you're not fighting a
[54:13] physical being but you're fighting a
[54:15] spiritual warfare now God the devil is
[54:17] trying to give you a delusion of church
[54:19] or order but you are fighting a
[54:21] spiritual warfare now and the devil
[54:24] wants to take your time and if he can
[54:27] get your time he got your soul God wants
[54:30] your time and glory to God he wants your
[54:34] time when we with him and when you can
[54:37] get away with God and serve him and not
[54:40] watch television the stories I was a
[54:44] young man and my sister had it on Days
[54:46] of our lives in another world and Young
[54:49] and the Restless glory to God but I'm
[54:51] telling you if you can get away from the
[54:53] things of the world and get away from
[54:56] the cell phone and say God I'm gonna put
[54:58] this phone down for a week and I'm gonna
[55:01] pray for the same time I'll be on my
[55:03] phone and watch won't God move
[55:09] I told little sister said it I said
[55:12] we got to get these children saved
[55:14] before you give them a cell phone
[55:16] that's because the cell phone gonna
[55:18] occupy them eight hours or more a day
[55:22] they sleep with it
[55:24] they got it all the time
[55:26] I went and get some groceries
[55:28] from Kroger's
[55:30] and the lady that
[55:32] customer said yeah say Mr Dave you left
[55:36] your phone in the buggy in a parking lot
[55:39] I got it
[55:41] is you coming back to get it
[55:43] I said I get it tomorrow after I get off
[55:45] work
[55:46] that's because that phone is nothing but
[55:47] the devil
[55:49] nothing but the devil
[55:51] I put the Bible on it and I clicked the
[55:54] Bible
[55:55] and it want me to buy some ads
[55:59] come to buy ads I come to hear the word
[56:02] of the Lord
[56:03] every time I click on it to hear the
[56:05] Bible or the message whatever I'm
[56:07] listening to he got an ad for me to
[56:09] click on and say bye now
[56:12] amen so Jesus
[56:15] he wants your heart
[56:18] that's the only way he can control your
[56:21] mind
[56:22] he must have your heart
[56:24] and in that heart there must be pure
[56:27] unadulterated love
[56:29] let me read something here
[56:45] prayer is a great gift
[56:47] not a popular gift
[56:49] a rare gift
[56:52] prayer is not the fruit of natural
[56:54] talents
[56:56] it is the product of faith
[56:59] of Holiness of deeply spiritual
[57:01] character
[57:03] men learn to pray as they learn to love
[57:07] perfection in simplicity
[57:10] in humility in faith
[57:12] these forms
[57:14] its Chief ingredients novice
[57:18] in these graces are not adapted in
[57:21] prayer
[57:22] it cannot be seized upon by untrained
[57:25] hands
[57:26] graduates in Heaven's highest School of
[57:29] Art
[57:31] can alone touch its finest keys
[57:34] raised its sweetest highest notes
[57:38] fine material
[57:40] fine finishes are requisite
[57:43] Master Wegman are required
[57:46] so a master Workman is required in
[57:49] prayer
[57:50] you know if you get your master's degree
[57:51] a master Workman is required
[57:56] for me a journeyman cannot execute the
[57:59] work of Prayer
[58:01] a mere gentleman can't do it
[58:04] the spirit of prayer should rule our
[58:06] spirits and our conduct
[58:09] amen
[58:12] Spirit of prayer should rule our spirit
[58:14] and our conduct
[58:17] the spirit of prayer chamber must
[58:19] control our lives or the closet hour
[58:22] will be dull and lapless
[58:25] always praying in the spirit always
[58:28] acting in the spirit of prayer these
[58:31] make our praying strong
[58:33] the spirit of every moment is that which
[58:36] in part strength to the closet communion
[58:41] it is what we are out of the closet
[58:44] gives victory
[58:46] or brings defeat to the closet
[58:49] so when you pray in the closet
[58:53] and you act unseemingly out the closet
[58:59] if the spirit of the world prevails in
[59:02] our non-closet hours
[59:04] the spirit of the world will prevail in
[59:07] our closet hours
[59:09] and that will be a vein and
[59:13] heartful Force
[59:16] see God is looking
[59:18] for someone that's going to pray
[59:20] as the end time is closing in on us
[59:24] you ain't got time to do nothing
[59:27] your time is Zapped your energy is
[59:30] Zapped
[59:31] but you got to Fall Away
[59:34] and find Jesus
[59:36] you got to fall away and find Christ
[59:41] you find yourself when you ain't preed
[59:44] in a whole week
[59:46] you find yourself where you having
[59:48] contact God
[59:50] and the devil pushes you further to the
[59:53] things of the world yes education is
[59:55] good
[59:57] but I found out it gets you further away
[59:59] from God
[1:00:00] if you're not focused
[1:00:02] on what the prize is
[1:00:05] because we ain't taking nothing on the
[1:00:07] other side
[1:00:08] but our character the prophet said
[1:00:10] so now
[1:00:12] you must be focused on what the word
[1:00:14] said
[1:00:15] focus on what the kingdom is doing
[1:00:18] focus on what God has called you to do
[1:00:21] amen I tell the young people I said you
[1:00:24] can go to school
[1:00:26] get a degree
[1:00:27] I said but if you go there and you don't
[1:00:29] pray
[1:00:30] you can have fingernail polish on
[1:00:32] you have lipstick on you have earrings
[1:00:34] on
[1:00:35] because now the world is corrupting you
[1:00:39] because the strong man is gone
[1:00:42] strong man is gone
[1:00:44] the only way the strong man can stay
[1:00:46] there is prayer there
[1:00:49] we got to watch ourselves and guard our
[1:00:52] spirit
[1:00:53] that the strong man never leave
[1:00:55] but the strong man will walk away if
[1:00:58] prayer goes
[1:00:59] so the only way we can keep the strong
[1:01:02] man there it must be the Holy Ghost
[1:01:05] it must be the genuine Life of Christ
[1:01:09] and that Life of Christ is God in you
[1:01:13] you veiled from the world
[1:01:16] you unveil you failed to the
[1:01:18] denominations
[1:01:20] the unveiling of Christ is in you wow
[1:01:23] you look like Christ you act like Christ
[1:01:26] you talk like Christ
[1:01:28] you crisis
[1:01:30] you don't want to hear nothing but what
[1:01:32] the word said
[1:01:33] and when you come out of prayer God I
[1:01:36] want to be anointed
[1:01:37] I want to be inspired that's what I can
[1:01:40] see tonight by Pastor Simmons
[1:01:43] he's a brother called
[1:01:44] if you don't do nothing be anointed
[1:01:47] pray to be anointed
[1:01:48] I thank the Lord for his presence and
[1:01:51] his grace in helping me
[1:01:53] telling me things that didn't feel good
[1:01:56] to my flesh
[1:01:57] but was good to my soul I said Lord I
[1:02:00] got to get there
[1:02:01] I got to get to that place but I'm
[1:02:03] telling you tonight
[1:02:05] church we got to reconsider
[1:02:07] we got to reevaluate our Christian Life
[1:02:10] whether we are getting along with God or
[1:02:12] not
[1:02:13] don't ask mom and dad and sister and
[1:02:15] brother to go pray with you get in the
[1:02:16] corner and pray yourself
[1:02:18] little Earnest get in the corner and
[1:02:20] pray yourself because trouble is out
[1:02:22] there waiting for you
[1:02:24] and the trouble is out there and the
[1:02:25] devil is Raging now he wants to make you
[1:02:27] do everything that he wants you to do
[1:02:31] but if you get away from God you'll do
[1:02:33] it
[1:02:34] but why are you here said Lord I'm gonna
[1:02:36] get something while I'm here I ain't
[1:02:38] coming to church for nothing I'm coming
[1:02:40] to make the preacher preach I'm coming
[1:02:41] that God will anoint me will give me
[1:02:44] what I stand in need of I need a fresh
[1:02:46] outpouring of the Holy Ghost I need a
[1:02:49] surge of God in my life I don't want to
[1:02:51] talk about no foolishness I don't want
[1:02:53] to hear no food all I want to hear is
[1:02:55] God
[1:02:56] the guys at work they talk to me they
[1:02:58] said preacher you don't want to hear
[1:02:59] nothing about the world all you want to
[1:03:01] do is talk about the Lord and maybe your
[1:03:03] garden
[1:03:05] you get me off the Lord they start
[1:03:06] talking about my garden I said now let's
[1:03:08] talk about Jesus a little bit
[1:03:11] I said because it's the spirit
[1:03:13] the spirit of Christ
[1:03:16] one of the ladies at the job said
[1:03:18] he's a rough man
[1:03:20] I said why she said oh you talk about is
[1:03:22] Jesus in the morning why we eat
[1:03:24] breakfast I said what you want to talk
[1:03:26] about naked women and all this stuff

[1:03:29] what is the best to talk about
[1:03:33] what is the best to talk about brother
[1:03:35] Fred's son there he said boy they're
[1:03:37] talking about the Lord
[1:03:38] I said when God
[1:03:41] when you create an atmosphere
[1:03:44] and you love God
[1:03:47] that's what makes the difference Church
[1:03:50] that's what makes the difference
[1:03:51] Proverbs 16 you don't have to go there
[1:03:54] to be slow to anger
[1:03:57] see prayer keeps you from being angry
[1:04:00] prayer keeps you humble prayer keeps you
[1:04:03] that you can hear some things that might
[1:04:05] be not good to your flesh but good for
[1:04:08] your soul
[1:04:09] you might not know it now but it'll be
[1:04:12] good to you
[1:04:13] you see my mom and dad told me stay out
[1:04:15] the street son
[1:04:17] stay out the street take care of your
[1:04:19] wife stay out the street don't do those
[1:04:20] things
[1:04:21] amen I got the Colombian and Pastor say
[1:04:24] the same thing see how decree Street get
[1:04:25] the Holy Ghost that's what's going to
[1:04:27] keep you the holy spirit is going to
[1:04:28] keep you and I'm telling you tonight you
[1:04:30] that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:33] develop a prayer time
[1:04:35] say God I'm going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:04:38] don't be ashamed that you ain't got it
[1:04:39] because many people got it that's older
[1:04:41] than you that don't have it
[1:04:43] said I'm going to develop a prayer time
[1:04:45] and God I'm going to pray unto the
[1:04:46] baptism by the Holy Ghost comes inside
[1:04:48] of me and not me knowing it but you're
[1:04:50] gonna confirm it to me
[1:04:52] can a nine month lady say she ain't
[1:04:54] pregnant and don't know what she know
[1:04:57] she pregnant
[1:04:58] and when the Holy Spirit impregnated you
[1:05:00] you have no more head knowledge but it's
[1:05:02] heart knowledge
[1:05:03] it comes from the heart now and that's
[1:05:06] the way you do it comes from the heart
[1:05:09] we got brothers that be in the church
[1:05:11] after the service doing the service just
[1:05:13] crying out said I want more of God
[1:05:16] I said God
[1:05:18] I hate a prophet of God say
[1:05:20] if somebody ain't hiding or crying
[1:05:22] something is wrong with my Ministry
[1:05:24] you want people to get closer to God
[1:05:27] see we got to get out of the church
[1:05:29] church entity and family stuff we got to
[1:05:32] get closer to God
[1:05:33] amen and I tell my family I said well uh
[1:05:37] sometimes I get I get ridiculed and I
[1:05:39] get treated bad with the family but I
[1:05:42] said Lord I Thank you
[1:05:43] I had family members that encouraged me
[1:05:46] out since I've been down there
[1:05:48] that come right to the church
[1:05:50] praise God
[1:05:52] I said take off their pants
[1:05:54] if you come into church God bless you
[1:05:58] I'm telling you the truth
[1:06:01] you see what I'm saying I preached to
[1:06:02] him
[1:06:03] get away from these sinful things and
[1:06:05] watch God bless you because when
[1:06:07] sickness come you want to know where you
[1:06:08] stand with God
[1:06:10] you want to know that you just don't
[1:06:12] have regular Faith you got Prevailing
[1:06:14] Faith you got perfect faith that
[1:06:16] overcomes
[1:06:17] faith is our victory tonight
[1:06:20] and when you look at it imagination
[1:06:22] conscience memory reason and affection
[1:06:24] you look at these things God has to
[1:06:27] operate
[1:06:28] in these things that six it's his faith
[1:06:31] it has to operate all these things and
[1:06:34] when it operates these things then now
[1:06:36] you in tune with the word and the word
[1:06:39] is God and the Word was with God and the
[1:06:41] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:06:43] and the Bible said we beheld the glory
[1:06:45] after all the only begotten of the
[1:06:47] father full of grace and truth because
[1:06:49] the law came by Moses but Grace and
[1:06:51] Truth came by Jesus Christ so when you
[1:06:53] standing on that word in your heart then
[1:06:55] God is able to bless you God is able to
[1:06:57] walk in such a presence and such an
[1:07:00] anointing in your life that now you can
[1:07:02] say the resurrection is here God I'm
[1:07:04] looking for the resurrection where's the
[1:07:06] resurrection it's in me now I want to
[1:07:08] see the power of the Resurrection
[1:07:11] I want to see the power of God in my
[1:07:13] life I just don't want to go to church I
[1:07:16] want to see the resurrection power in me
[1:07:18] until somebody takes a hold to it
[1:07:24] prophet of God said
[1:07:26] the brother was on the train
[1:07:31] he got on the train
[1:07:34] and everybody around that preacher or
[1:07:37] that man
[1:07:39] began to cry out
[1:07:41] and repent of their sins
[1:07:44] because their life and the anointing
[1:07:46] that was on that man
[1:07:49] that's what I need
[1:07:52] at the very presence of God
[1:07:55] be upon you
[1:07:57] my co-worker came back to me the next
[1:07:59] day
[1:08:00] he said I'm sorry for calling you the
[1:08:02] devil
[1:08:03] I said don't worry about it I love you
[1:08:05] just to say
[1:08:07] I said must Jesus better cross along and
[1:08:09] all the world go free there's a cross
[1:08:11] for you there's a cross for me
[1:08:13] I said simple scriptures like baptism in
[1:08:16] Jesus name
[1:08:18] I said now Paul
[1:08:20] came to the epicles of Ephesus find
[1:08:22] certain disciples saying have you
[1:08:23] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:08:25] believe
[1:08:26] he said we're not ever heard of any Holy
[1:08:28] Ghost he said then where were you
[1:08:29] baptized he said John the Baptist the
[1:08:31] baptism of repent of saying that they
[1:08:32] wait on him would you come out there
[1:08:34] which is Christ the lord
[1:08:35] and when they heard this they were
[1:08:38] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I
[1:08:41] said no way in the scriptures was
[1:08:42] anybody ever baptizing father son the
[1:08:44] Holy Ghost I said some of these truths
[1:08:46] in the Bible I said I don't understand
[1:08:48] why you can't believe them and they're
[1:08:50] ready in this scripture I said but it
[1:08:52] takes the Holy Ghost and his soul to
[1:08:54] believe it you got to believe from the
[1:08:56] heart you got to believe from the heart
[1:08:58] and this Harvest Time Has Come in Church
[1:09:00] Harvest time is coming and you're going
[1:09:03] to have to show your hand you're gonna
[1:09:06] have to show your hand what you believe
[1:09:08] because guess what if the Holy Ghost
[1:09:10] says it's not in the heart your hand
[1:09:12] gonna have to be showed you're going to
[1:09:15] have to show whether you believe God and
[1:09:17] whether you believe the word you're
[1:09:19] gonna have to show your hand and when
[1:09:21] your hand is shorter the devil Gonna
[1:09:23] Know Who You Are he knows who you are
[1:09:25] tonight and all you got to say Lord I
[1:09:27] Thank You for Your Mercy it's harvest
[1:09:29] time now everybody's going in their
[1:09:32] position and they're going in their
[1:09:34] position where they're going to be I
[1:09:35] said but Lord let the Holy Ghost come
[1:09:37] and reveal himself in such a way yeah
[1:09:39] that the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:41] might Elevate us into a place that the
[1:09:44] power of the Resurrection might take
[1:09:46] full root in our lives through our
[1:09:48] prayer life and as you pray you're gonna
[1:09:50] die that's why people don't want to pray
[1:09:52] yeah and when you pray you're going to
[1:09:54] die to your self and all your ideas and
[1:09:57] your thoughts and the Very power of
[1:09:59] Jesus Christ is coming inside of you and
[1:10:01] that will be the Wonder working power of
[1:10:03] God and that's what's going to take you
[1:10:05] over
[1:10:07] that's what's going to take you I tell
[1:10:09] my son
[1:10:10] I said God
[1:10:12] would do for you that you can't do for
[1:10:15] yourself
[1:10:17] the Bible says he's strong that executed
[1:10:19] his word
[1:10:21] Jeremiah 32 and 16 said is there
[1:10:24] anything too hard for the Lord there's
[1:10:27] nothing tonight too hard for the Lord I
[1:10:29] told a sister on Saturday I said he can
[1:10:32] raise Lazarus from the dead
[1:10:34] four days thinking in the grave your
[1:10:36] situation is not that bad I said when
[1:10:39] you create an atmosphere God will come
[1:10:41] on this scene she said amen thank you
[1:10:43] Lord I don't know what kind of condition
[1:10:45] health-wise that she was in I know she's
[1:10:48] bedridden but I told her daughter and
[1:10:51] her sister
[1:10:52] I said if we can create the right
[1:10:54] atmosphere
[1:10:56] God Ado exceedingly
[1:10:59] and abundantly
[1:11:00] we got to take God out the box
[1:11:03] and bring him
[1:11:05] right where we at 3731 Martin Street
[1:11:09] but our prayer do it
[1:11:11] you get a church in prayer
[1:11:14] and God gonna generate love in their
[1:11:16] heart
[1:11:17] not tongue speakers but a prayer life
[1:11:21] don't complain about what you got to do
[1:11:23] just pray
[1:11:25] don't complain about what you got to go
[1:11:27] through just pray because the Bible said
[1:11:30] if Jesus bear to cross along and all the
[1:11:31] world go free notice a cross for you
[1:11:33] there's a cross for me
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] I had my superintendent on the job I was
[1:11:40] treating me kind of rough I knew it was
[1:11:42] a spirit but I said Lord everything you
[1:11:45] see I say yes yes sir amen
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:54] he went in the kitchen
[1:11:56] drop his drink and feed her down
[1:11:59] and I come up there and saw the water
[1:12:01] all over the floor he said Carl you know
[1:12:03] what
[1:12:04] you're a good man
[1:12:08] she's a good man
[1:12:10] see God want to see just how much you
[1:12:12] can take
[1:12:14] he want to see how much you can suffer
[1:12:17] how much you can take
[1:12:20] from the world and the things of the
[1:12:22] world
[1:12:23] now everybody look and say that man act
[1:12:26] like he love you
[1:12:29] cause everybody else
[1:12:30] real back at him
[1:12:33] but I accepted everything he had to say
[1:12:37] and the director come back and said man
[1:12:39] I don't know what you did to the
[1:12:41] superintendent
[1:12:42] he said but man he'll go back for you I
[1:12:44] don't care where you at
[1:12:46] he can't say nothing bad about you
[1:12:50] because
[1:12:52] I let him talk and do me just like he
[1:12:55] wanted to do me
[1:12:56] and God has sinned sometime that Pastor
[1:13:00] to hurt your feelings
[1:13:02] then you'll stop praying
[1:13:05] or brother or sister or wife or husband
[1:13:08] see prayer helps you to die
[1:13:11] see most problems with us we don't want
[1:13:13] to die
[1:13:15] we want to be half dead
[1:13:17] covered up half dead covered up half
[1:13:20] covered up but still living
[1:13:23] but I'm saying tonight let the Holy
[1:13:25] Ghost give you your death certificate
[1:13:27] let him give you your death certificate
[1:13:29] die no matter what somebody say about
[1:13:32] your children your wife your family no
[1:13:34] matter what they say about you die
[1:13:38] a priest is sermon about two months ago
[1:13:39] three months ago
[1:13:41] perfect strength through perfect
[1:13:42] weakness my mom was sitting right in
[1:13:45] there I said my mama ain't nobody
[1:13:48] I said Mom you ain't nothing
[1:13:50] my sister I said you ain't nothing
[1:13:53] I said my wife you ain't nothing
[1:13:55] none of your family nothing the Simmons
[1:13:57] family ain't nothing today's family
[1:13:59] ain't nothing and I said I ain't nothing
[1:14:01] and they were so shocked when I said
[1:14:03] that
[1:14:04] when you've realized that you nothing
[1:14:07] and the prophet of God said don't rise
[1:14:09] above it
[1:14:10] see when you think you something you
[1:14:12] can't take what people put on you
[1:14:14] you got to realize God is showing me in
[1:14:16] prayer getting up two or three o'clock
[1:14:18] in the morning waking me up they pray
[1:14:20] to time to go to work sometime God said
[1:14:22] you ain't nothing
[1:14:24] and once you realize that then I can use
[1:14:26] you
[1:14:28] when you think you somebody then God
[1:14:30] can't use you that's in the mind see our
[1:14:33] mind
[1:14:35] he said he been in some places when he's
[1:14:39] with real men
[1:14:40] they were real men Giants and then he
[1:14:43] went in some places where a man just had
[1:14:45] about a few suits
[1:14:47] he was so puffed up that he was somebody
[1:14:48] he but I went into monarchs and kings
[1:14:51] and places these were real men were so
[1:14:54] humble then he went with that man just
[1:14:55] got to change your clothes and maybe 50
[1:14:57] people in the church are hundred
[1:14:59] and you couldn't tell him not a novice
[1:15:02] God is showing me now you got to humble
[1:15:04] yourself
[1:15:05] you got to get to a place where I don't
[1:15:07] care what nobody say to you or do to you
[1:15:09] you got to die
[1:15:11] and the Holy Ghost will come then like
[1:15:15] it's yours yours think we got a holy
[1:15:17] ghost but it's a ghost but it ain't holy
[1:15:19] but once somebody do you wrong then it
[1:15:21] reveals
[1:15:24] I said Lord let me die
[1:15:26] the guys how you let the man talk to you
[1:15:27] like that I said what about that don't
[1:15:29] worry about that glory to God
[1:15:32] my children talk to me like that
[1:15:34] sometimes
[1:15:35] my wife she give me a good whipping
[1:15:37] after sermon sometimes
[1:15:41] let me die
[1:15:43] the more I can die the more God can be
[1:15:45] glorified
[1:15:47] I didn't come to Camden to play games I
[1:15:49] come to somebody might be saved
[1:15:52] I come to save my family them that's
[1:15:54] ordained to eternal life
[1:15:56] I said that's what I come to do
[1:15:58] I didn't come for no other reason I
[1:15:59] didn't leave this church for no other
[1:16:00] reason I could have stayed here and been
[1:16:02] a preacher and been all right
[1:16:05] but God said go
[1:16:07] for 10 years I stayed here
[1:16:10] 20 years I stayed at God said go I said

[1:16:28] didn't want to leave

[1:16:32] don't know that they figure I just got
[1:16:33] up and go
[1:16:35] that's a blessing but I cried many
[1:16:37] nights because I didn't want to leave
[1:16:38] here I've been here 22 and a half years
[1:16:40] I didn't want to go
[1:16:42] but God said I need you to go
[1:16:44] because they need to hear the word of

[1:17:10] in your help to the pastor
[1:17:13] and these Ministers of the Gospel
[1:17:16] I found out
[1:17:18] that a true family of God
[1:17:21] that people that really love God
[1:17:24] better than jewelry

[1:17:56] we're not following a man but the son of
[1:17:59] man
[1:18:00] without the Holy Ghost you'll follow a
[1:18:02] man
[1:18:03] but with the true baptism of the Holy
[1:18:05] Ghost you know he's this there as eloisa
[1:18:08] pointing you to Isaac which is Christ
[1:18:11] in us the hope of glory god above us

[1:19:00] the greatest battle ever fought I like
[1:19:02] one thing he says that you know good
[1:19:05] having good Brothers is more than all
[1:19:07] the jewelry worth more than all the
[1:19:09] jewelry all the gold that you can have
[1:19:11] just to have Fellowship somebody that's
[1:19:14] going to pray for you amen don't call
[1:19:16] your name in prayer that that means more
[1:19:18] than anything you know sometimes you
[1:19:21] look at family and what is your what is
[1:19:24] your family you know a real family you
[1:19:26] know those that are bear across with you
[1:19:28] y'all believe that tonight those that
[1:19:31] you know stand alone with you sometimes
[1:19:34] I was telling somebody that they came to
[1:19:36] my mind I said you know
[1:19:39] everybody's going through something
[1:19:40] right now
[1:19:42] I told them that I says you know
[1:19:44] sometimes we don't know but
[1:19:47] because we don't sit down and talk to
[1:19:49] people long enough
[1:19:50] I said but everybody's dealing with
[1:19:52] something
[1:19:53] I said some people trials you can just
[1:19:55] see out in the Forefront
[1:19:57] others you can't see because you won't
[1:19:59] know unless they tell you I says but you
[1:20:02] know sometimes you might think you're
[1:20:04] the only one
[1:20:06] you might think you're the only one
[1:20:07] going through
[1:20:08] I says but you sit down with with people
[1:20:11] long enough
[1:20:12] and you'll find out sometimes that you
[1:20:15] ain't the only one going through
[1:20:17] that we all fighting a battle like I
[1:20:20] said this week you might can just see
[1:20:21] yours but sit down with somebody long
[1:20:24] enough and you'll find out that we all
[1:20:27] need to pray for one another we all need
[1:20:30] to hold one another up in prayer amen we
[1:20:33] all need to keep the name of Jesus in
[1:20:36] our mouths for the next man y'all
[1:20:38] believe that tonight God is so good the
[1:20:40] greatest battle ever fought amen and you
[1:20:42] know he's hitting those highlights
[1:20:43] talking about how important Holy Ghost
[1:20:45] is you know I believe the scripture says
[1:20:47] that Darkness was going to cover the
[1:20:49] Earth Earth and gross Darkness amongst
[1:20:51] the people but he says arise and shine
[1:20:53] for thy light has come and the glory of
[1:20:55] the Lord has risen upon thee the dark it
[1:20:58] get out there that's the more we're
[1:20:59] looking for God's glory and the more
[1:21:01] we're looking for is Grace depending on
[1:21:03] him to be more to us than we ever you
[1:21:06] know uh uh thought we ever needed amen I
[1:21:09] was looking at us sharing with um them
[1:21:11] in a Minister's meeting the other day
[1:21:12] you know and my son's school and how
[1:21:15] they the boys was fighting one day and
[1:21:17] next day the boy come out there with a
[1:21:19] knife and stabbing a couple of other
[1:21:21] students I said that if he could have
[1:21:23] got his hands on the gun he'd have
[1:21:24] brought a gun to school but just
[1:21:27] thinking about those things I said this
[1:21:29] is the hour that we're living in the
[1:21:31] hour where we're living in where other
[1:21:33] people not only is their minds going
[1:21:35] insane but the young people they're
[1:21:38] having real mental battles they're
[1:21:40] they're having real things that they
[1:21:42] have to fight and deal with that you and
[1:21:45] I as individuals might even have to deal
[1:21:46] with at that age but that's the much
[1:21:49] more we're going to have to have God's
[1:21:50] protection and the plot of blood over
[1:21:53] our homes and over our children over our
[1:21:55] families because we can't be with them
[1:21:57] there all the time you know my wife was
[1:22:01] telling me about a situation how the two
[1:22:03] children was fighting in the Bus Loop
[1:22:05] and somebody did a drive by shooting
[1:22:06] just shooting in the crowd I says but
[1:22:09] nevertheless we look at all those things
[1:22:11] and what else can we do but look to God
[1:22:14] we got no other choice now in the hour
[1:22:16] that we live in but to look to him he's
[1:22:18] our only hope not only salvation he's
[1:22:21] the only keeper the only one gonna watch
[1:22:23] over him the only one that's going to
[1:22:25] keep them not only do they have to
[1:22:27] battle like he says all that but you got
[1:22:29] sicknesses you got all these things
[1:22:30] hitting that one time you if you try to
[1:22:33] uh put it all in your mind your mind
[1:22:35] explode but we don't look at those
[1:22:38] things we look at the victory that God
[1:22:39] has already brought in our lives we look
[1:22:42] at the promise that God has made us and
[1:22:44] how he promised to keep us not only us
[1:22:46] but our children our whole house as long
[1:22:48] as we keep that blood applied so it's in
[1:22:50] our best interest a lot of times to stay
[1:22:52] with God come on because if you if you
[1:22:56] was to leave God because remember he
[1:22:58] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:22:59] you no nor forsake you but if you was to
[1:23:02] leave him and leave from out under God's
[1:23:05] umbrella you imagine what the devil will
[1:23:07] do to your life or what he could do to
[1:23:09] your life the only reason why he hadn't
[1:23:12] done the things that he want to do or he
[1:23:14] desire to do your life is because you
[1:23:16] under God's umbrella and all those fiery
[1:23:19] darts and things that he's shooting he
[1:23:21] can't penetrate the umbrella that God
[1:23:23] has got you under he can't make it
[1:23:25] through that blood so I thank God
[1:23:26] tonight thank God for his grace thank
[1:23:29] God for the word that we heard tonight
