Father, for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. You have your Bibles. You turn with me to the book of Second Peter. It's good to be Amen. in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been kind of running a lot here lately, last couple of months. So, y'all just pray for us. So, we do thank each and one of you for supporting the services on the other week that you press your way out. Amen. Just support. We thank you so much, Amen, for your support. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Um, second Peter 1, let's start at 10-2. Wherefore the rather, brethren, gave our diligence to make your calling and your election sure. For if you do these things, you shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth. Let us pray. Father Lord we thank you for your grace and Lord for your mercy. God we pray that you bless thy word in Jesus name. Amen. may be seated. Also, if you'll turn with me to the book of Ephesians, the book of Ephesians, the um 4th chapter, let's 3 11-15. Ephesians 4:11-5. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Do we all come into the unity of defaith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, but by the slight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby their lie and wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ. Amen. Go back to Peter tonight, second Peter. And that's where I want to draw my thought from tonight. Amen. And that's God establishing his church. God establishing his church. I looked up the word establishing. This is I was um looking at in time. Like it failed me back there, but I didn't hear um where y'all were in the services. But I looked up the word establish and just to give you some where I'm looking to be going by the grace of God and several definition but I like what I saw is it means to to be firmly rooted stable and grounded in faith truth truth and God's love making one unshakable in the face of challenges. I like that. Unshakable in the face of challenges. Establish. None of you noticed this that especially when it comes to the church world. Man has tried to make God church or try to establish what they think God want the church to be established upon. And no doubt I believe their intentions are good. Some of the things that they are instituting is it's real good. But it's not what God the way that God wanted to be built and established upon. &gt;&gt; God never wanted his church to be established upon man ideas. That's &gt;&gt; true. Amen. especially when it come to organization denominational systems. Now though those things may be good and we appreciate you know the people you know taking the initiative at least to try to establish something in a way that they want to see the people come to some kind of place of settlement. And in this hour uh especially and also as we notice even all down through the church ages and the history of the church, we saw that how that first church Ephesus which mean aim at and relax who started out Paul being that messenger and Paul after being converted, I like that Paul at one time was trying to establish the church himself. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't according to the way that God intend for it to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was Paul sincere? Yes, sir. He was very zealous to carry out what he thought that God wanted to do for the church. But instead of doing that, he was actually persecuting &gt;&gt; the very church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you see how man can have good intention, be sincere, but can be sincerely wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not saying what he wasn't doing wasn't good because at the time that was his understanding. But when he met God, when he met Jesus, &gt;&gt; IT ALWAYS BRING ABOUT A difference when you meet the author and the finisher. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; and I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON, every minister MUST MEET THAT SAME PERSON &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO BE effectively established, grounded, ROOTED &gt;&gt; IN PRESENT DAY TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. IN OTHER WORDS, WE WANT TO BRING GOD OUT OF HISTORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WE WANT TO MAKE THAT GOD SO VISIBLE, SO VISIBLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN TOUCH HIM TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; EACH INDIVIDUAL. YES. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COME IN contact with the living Jesus Christ themselves. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; BUT THE WAY THAT HAS TO BEEN, IT HAS TO BE GOD PROVIDED WAY FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible SAID THERE'S A WAY THAT SEEMTH RIGHT. IT SEEMS GOOD TO BUILD SCHOOLS, to build uh apartments and all of these things for the people to have, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD IS ESTABLISHING HIS CHURCH ON. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Neither is it education, &gt;&gt; seminary teaching. GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN WORD. IT HAS TO BE THE WORD THAT GOD PURPOSELY SENDS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THAT PARTICULAR GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CUZ IF NOT, THE PEOPLE BE LIVING IN THE GLARE OF ANOTHER TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL STILL BE TRYING TO BUILD AN ARC. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS THAT'S HISTORY. AND IT WAS THE TRUTH, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT PRESENT TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IT IS. IT WAS WHAT GOD USED FOR THAT PARTICULAR TIME. GOD HAS SEASONS AND HE HAS A PURPOSE AND HE WANTS TO GET A PEOPLE. Let me read something right. Book of Deuteronomy. Amen. Deuteronomy 28. 289. The Lord shall establish thee in holy people unto himself, as he has sworn unto thee. If thou should keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. See, God is going to establish thee. How does he do it? Through the word. But now that word of God, IT HAS TO HAVE SUCH an effect upon the people TO BE ABLE TO BRING THEM BACK to a place THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RESTORED BACK TO the original faith. That was one of the REASON WHY GOD SENT the Elijah this day TO TURN OUR HEARTS back and Lord knows it was needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. BECAUSE THE CHURCH WORLD AS WE KNOW IT HAS DONE ESTABLISHED ALL KIND OF things &gt;&gt; off the word AND TRYING TO BRING THE PEOPLE INTO A system of organizing religious BUT GOD COULD NOT PUT HIS approval on that. HE USED IT FOR A PARTICULAR TIME. BUT REMEMBER, GOD WAS STILL uh uh restoring and bringing TO PEOPLE TO A PLACE THAT THEY FULL ATTENTION WOULD BE BACK ON HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; NOT ON ANY BISHOP OR ANY CERTAIN CHURCH OR ANY CERTAIN DOCTRINE, BUT BACK TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE HAD TO restore the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE RAISES UP A PERSON TO GIVE HIM A PARTICULAR WORD FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THAT PARTICULAR GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEN WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO HEAR THAT VOICE, NOT A VOICE OF A MAN, BUT IT WAS A VERY VOICE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT IT'S A VOICE OF GOD BECAUSE HE SAID THAT MY SHEEP. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WILL HEAR MY VOICE. &gt;&gt; OH, come on. &gt;&gt; SHEEPS ONLY LISTEN TO THE GREAT SHEPHERD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY KNOW THE VOICE? BECAUSE WHEN THEY HEAR IT, IT DOES SOMETHING FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; IT RAN THEM AWAY FROM ANYBODY'S TRYING TO DICTATE TO THEM ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, NO OTHER NAME GIVEN AMONG MEN WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED BY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY MIGHT BE GREAT MEN, BUT THEY THEY THEY DID, BUT IT WAS ONLY GOD'S VOICE TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; And when they hear it, they can come to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm really excited to see how God and what he has been doing over all thousands of years bringing the people to a place that way they won't be as Paul said children toss to and fro with every win of doctrine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, WE WON'T BE EASY TO RUN HERE AND RUN THERE BECAUSE OF GREAT MEN AND PERSONALITIES and deep things and all. No, NO, NO, NO, NO. HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD ESTABLISHED THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD BECAUSE IF IT'S GOD CHURCH THEN HE HAS TO ESTABLISH UPON HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; OH YES. &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD OF GOD HAS TO BE RESTORED BACK IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT IT'S GOD OR NOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD BEGIN TO VINDICATE THAT WORD. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE PEOPLE BY SUPERNATURAL SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT THIS IS THUS SAYETH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL NOT VINDICATE A LIE. &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD IT IS, NO MATTER WHAT YOU BUILD, WHAT EMPIRE, ALL THAT YOU DID, IF THE SUPERNATURAL VINDICATION DON'T FOLLOW IT, IT'S NOT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. LORD, help us to understand especially in this hour that we live in. That's hard to get the people to be stable to understand the purpose of God for your particular life. Cuz there's so many voices, uncertain sounds. And Paul said, "How many men had crept in unaware." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Drawing the people away. See, and anytime any teaching or any preaching takes the people away from the word, that's not of God. WE SHOULD NOT BRING THE PEOPLE TO US, POINT THEM TO ANY KIND OF MAN IDEAS MINISTRIES. Our focus AT THE FAR MINISTRY IS TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO GOD AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR FOCUS. NOT THIS, NOT THAT, BUT JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BACK TO THE WORD, BACK TO GOD, BACK TO THE SUPERNATURAL, BACK TO THE SIGNS AND WONDERS, BACK TO LIVING A LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's what the early church did. Amen. &gt;&gt; So regard that early church in the book of Acts, they were first established in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost. We all knew what happened in the dark ages of history. How been Paul started out with the true word and as the time get along then the word almost got blacked out. The antichrist spirit, the false prophets, the false apostles came in until it got so bad to where they actually it was a spiritual blackout. took the Bibles from the people, established them up into some man-made creeds and dogmas, but yet God had a little light there still. And when that light come, then God expect for the people to walk in the light. And in this age, we know that it was completely blackout. And God raised up the servant of God to put a little light there in this age because God WAS GOING TO ESTABLISH HIS church again. God was going to have a people that that that was GOING TO RETURN BACK TO THE word again. He was going to bring them to a PLACE OF OF NOT BEING CONFUSED ABOUT whether they save or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's terrible when Christian CHURCH FOLKS DON'T KNOW FROM ONE WEEK TO THE NEXT WHETHER I'M SAVED OR WHETHER I'M NOT. &gt;&gt; And when you GET ON A STABLE LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO FIND SOME PLACE THE WAY YOU CAN GET SETTLED. &gt;&gt; Even all this truth that we have, we we still having problem with that. of people getting stable. IT'S BECAUSE THEY THEY TAKING THEIR REAL FOCUS OFF of the word. PAUL, IF YOU SAY, "FOLLOW ME, THOU FOLLOW CHRIST." &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS POINTING THE PEOPLE BACK TO JESUS CHRIST. AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO GET THE people settled. LET'S POINT THE PEOPLE TO CHRIST, THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S NOT PUT MAN ABOVE THE WORD, BUT LET'S PUT THE WORD ABOVE THE MAN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, help us &gt;&gt; to be established, rooted firmly. Why? Because you're going to have challenges. You're going to meet things that going to come against your very life. And you're going to have TO KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. &gt;&gt; You going to have to KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU GOT THE GOODS or not. And I find THAT WHEN PEOPLE NOT SURE and then when these CHALLENGES COME OF LIFE, THEY GET QUICKER WANT to run away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then they feel if they be in a different place that they are more spiritual then no you are not cuz IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED WHERE YOU WERE AT. YOU WE NEED AN ANCHOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT ABOUT WE HOLDING IT BUT SOMETHING THAT IS HOLDING YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ IN THIS FLESH, WE KNOW WE GET WEAK AND WEARY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO TO HOLD YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU &gt;&gt; AND TO KEEP YOU SOBER MINDED &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON REGARDING WHAT COMES, &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FACE, YOU CAN SAY, "I'M STANDING ON THE WORD. REGARDLESS WHO LEAVES, WHO COMES, I'M STANDING ON ONE PRINCIPLE &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE. GOD WORD IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PERSONALITIES. &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, BROTHER. You meet a lot of people and talk about a lot of things. I said, I can't v for none of that. I stay with this. &gt;&gt; I don't see what you talking about sin, brother and sister. I ain't You know what I'm saying? But I want to stay with what I know is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; See, we ought not to be and thank God to see people that are settle minded, sober, regardless of what people think they got going on. I have one agenda and that's staying with Christ. &gt;&gt; Staying with the word. That's what the early church did. They had to face things. THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH SITUATION. BUT BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST, THE HOLY GHOST IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN establish you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say THAT AGAIN. THAT'S WHY IT'S URGENT. I thought about preaching urgency. IT'S URGENT, VERY URGENT, THAT YOU GET THE HOLY GHOST NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE YOUNG PEOPLE, CHILDREN, old people, YOU MUST RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. thought about our young people going to school and Lord knows can't just even imagine the challenges, the influence, the pollution, the things they have to contend with. peer pressure, all the filth that goes on in the schools, and they got to contend with that. How how are you going to be able to stand if God don't help you? &gt;&gt; Don't you ever think, you know, you're not don't worry about trying to be with the popular people, &gt;&gt; but stay with the popular God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the popular people most time going the wrong way this way of a yes it may be a lonely walk. It may not be a WALK THAT EVERYBODY YOU KNOW CHEER you on. But let ME TELL YOU GOD will be with you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL KEEP YOU TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'LL PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. I would say a friend, a good friend will be with you at all times. A good friend won't won't get you involved in things that's not right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a real friend to me. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; A real friend want me to say you don't do that. That's what real friends do. Stay away from those things. There's a lot of enticing spirits.

We done got away from the altar. We need to get back to the altar &gt;&gt; and not wait for THE MAN TO CALL IT. IF GOD BRING A CONVICTION ON YOUR HEART, GET UP HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CUZ IT'S GOD CALLING YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD INVITING YOU. GOD LETTING YOU KNOW THIS MIGHT BE YOUR LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; Too many time we go in and out of services. I tell the church back home. Don't wait till the next time. And when next time the devil be swiftier. But while that thing is freshly upon you now. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you hear that the spirit of God talking to you, say come. Then somebody and love spirit say don't go. Don't go. But God say come. Come now. Now is the day of your visitation. SEE GOD WANT TO VISIT YOU. YOU KNOW, GOD WANTS TO VISIT YOU IN A PERSONAL WAY. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS, "CALM DOWN. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ESTABLISH YOU IN THE TRUTH OF MY WORD." THAT'S THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all. Careers ain't going to establish you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You make some money, but what the trouble you have with it? &gt;&gt; Cars ain't going to establish you. It looks good and run good, but they still won't cast out no devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BIG HOUSES IN FANCY YARDS LOOKS GOOD TO THE PUBLIC, BUT AIN'T NO DEVIL BE CAST OUT. YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT GOING TO FIGHT DEVILS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh my. Pray God calling somebody. I pray you hearken to the call. I DON'T CARE HOW YOUNG YOU IS. YOU'RE NOT TOO YOUNG.

COME GET IT NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A lot of time. Let me tell you what the devil does. Sometime people just want to wait till somebody else to come. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Don't wait on them. &gt;&gt; This is personal. &gt;&gt; God call you by your own name. Each one of you, you got a name, don't you? If I say joy, there was two joys and God can talk to both joys. BUT WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, GOD CALL YOU. THAT'S WHY EVEN WITH THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, GOD MADE IT SO PERSONALIZED. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I'M GOING TO SEND you Elijah." AND THAT'S THE WHOMVERSOEVER WILL, LET HIM COME. This is not a group thing. It's not a family relationship when it come to this, y'all. This is a personalized thing that God getting us ready for that great. Y'all see the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE THE NUCLEAR BOMBS? COME ON, BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; Come on, misters. THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T WAIT. DON'T WAIT ON NOBODY ELSE. YOU COME. YOU MUST GET IT NOW. IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING DESPERATE THAT OLD AS WELL AS YOUNG. I DON'T CARE HOW OLD YOU ARE. THE SAD PART ABOUT most of the older people, one of the main one needed, they'll sit right there looking at you. Cuz oh, I ain't going to be looking BAD. LOOK BAD. YOU LOOK REAL BAD. YOU MISSED THIS RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU TALKING ABOUT LOOKING BAD. YOU WANT TO MISS THE RAPTURE. LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU DON'T GET THE HOLY GHOST, PEOPLE, IF YOU DON'T GET THE HOLY GHOST NOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT WHEN UP ON US. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST WILL ENTITLE YOU TO THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you want to go into the rapture. &gt;&gt; But then, do you have the Holy Ghost? Come on. We ought to have church service that we ought not to worry about what time, but we want people that GET DESPERATE. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO HAVE IT. How about you, sister brother? Come on, musician. HOW ABOUT IT? LET'S HAVE ONE OF THEM NIGHTS. WE USED TO HAVE THEM, BUT I'M CALLING THEM BACK. SO WHEN THE POWER OF GOD USED TO DROP DOWN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WERE ON A ONE CAR, THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE COME TO CHURCH. NOT TO LOOK PRETTY AND IT LOOK LIKE WE GOT SOMETHING WE DON'T. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, NOW IS THE TIME PEOPLE. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, let the Holy Ghost atmosphere If you don't want to come and pray, why don't you bow your head and pray with her?
