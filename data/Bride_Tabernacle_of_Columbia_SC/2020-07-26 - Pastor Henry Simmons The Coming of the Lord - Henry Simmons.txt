be long and soon we'll be leaving here second peter the third chapter it says in the third verse ii peter three and three says knowing this knowing this verse that there should come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where's the promise of his coming but since your fathers fell asleep all things contingent as it were from the beginning of creation for this they're willingly ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water in the water whereby the world the then was being over flooded with water perish but the heavens and earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserving the fire against the day of judgment and prediction of ungodly men but beloved we're not ignorant of this one thing one day is with the lord it's a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the lord is not slight concerning his promises some as some count slightness but is long-suffering to us one not willing in any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with the fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are there in shall be burned up sin that all these things shall be dissolved what might a person ought we to be in all holy conversation to god looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god when the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with the fervent heat nevertheless we are calling this promise look for a new heaven and a new earth when dwelleth righteousness god bless you in this word may be seated today we want to talk about the coming of the lord as we go to matthew 24 the coming of the lord surely that has been it has been sounded out that god the lord jesus is coming then it's been sounded out this morning that the day of the lord and sometimes we have a little trouble hearing i hope you can hear all right because i'm not really uh raising my voice too loud sometimes they say i overdo it so by the grace of god i hope you can hear all right matthew 24 and 3 says and as he sat upon the mountain of olive the disciples came to him privily saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i'm christ and shall see many and you shall hear of walls and rumors of walls see that you'll be not troubled all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nations shall rise against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and diverse places all these are the beginning of sorrow we look at the disciples wanted to know when to end what's going to come lord the coming of the lord as we look at it today is that that we are resting upon a promise that jesus christ will come again in his corporate body the bible talks about the lord descending from heaven the people of god that are believers are trusting that one day this world that's full of turmoil and trouble and chaos talk about the earthquakes and the pestilence and the different things that will take place when they ask what be the signs of your coming all these things we are experiencing now and because we are experiencing all these things but i want to use a little sub topic today as we go to thessalonians 1 and 5 as a thief in the night he's coming but i'm afraid that many will recognize it too late many will wake up out of their sleep and it'll be too late brother and sister may i have your attention see the word of god is trying to tell us something but i'm afraid that as one writer said i is a dull of hearing jesus told the jews you have eyes to see but you see not is to hear but you don't hear brother and sister takes a born again believer as he told nicodemus except the man be born again he cannot see cannot understand the kingdom of god brother and sister the bible says in the last days men will be lovers of themselves i believe we're more concerned about ourselves then we're concerned about the kingdom of god i heard the word of god says that in ii corinthians 13 examine yourself see whether or not you're in the faith or not brethren says it's time for us to take an examination because the lord is coming and if he's coming brother and sister have we examined ourselves take a good look at yourself where are you if he should come today am i ready to go with him brother and sister i want you to take an earnest and sincere examination but as i was praying sometimes we have our pity parties sometimes we go through our journal for tree experience and we're more concerned about our feelings we're more concerned about our problems and our conditions and what we have been through and what we are going through our minds are being confronted and we seem as though we're living in a world what we're reaching out and you join to be loved and we wonder if anybody cares about us as individuals but our focus should be on the coming of the lord for he'll come and i hold that to think not he'll come in a time when you a sex senator so much concern about you your feelings what you're going through rather than sister if jesus would have took time out to care about what he was going through and the pressure that was on him but brother and sister he saw something he saw amen you and i and one day we would need a savior we would need healing we would need peace he knew that he was the bridge that would bring man and god back together and if he did not come and do what god had ordained for his life he knew that he had a purpose for coming and that was to do the will of god so he was more concerned about the purpose in which he was born and what he came to do i'm saying brothers and sisters let's keep focus our lord is coming back again he's coming to get us out of this pet's house but you and i must look at the condition of the world and say lord who has done me wrong i want to know why am i going through the things that i'm going through why the world in the condition that is in what about these pestilence what about this uh uh a virus and what about amen all the chaos that are happening in the cities and then in the area amen all of the division and all the devices brother and sister we got to look beyond what's going on in our physical realm for that is the spiritual realm that we must embrace they are the place that god wants you to enter into that you might have the mind of god and know the will of god for your life yes there are pressures that are crushing you yes there are obstacles that are in your way and you can't seem to break away from whatever you're going through they're family problems there's a war going on within the inside of you but brother and sisters god wants to take you out of that frustration and that aggravation and bring you the place of peace coming of the lord first thessalonians 5. he's coming and it's coming the bible talks about as a thief in the night he said but this but of the times and seasoned brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the lord shall cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with a child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day shall overtake you as a thief we must understand that the day it's coming the day of the lord when judgment will strike the earth where the elements gonna melt with the firm and heat but that day should not overtake you they meant as a thief god amen said it won't take you like a thief the coming of the lord the lord gonna come and he's gonna judge the world in righteousness but that they should not take you as a thief there must be a people on the earth that are exemplified and they meant that i'm manifesting them that are chosen amen and ordained amen to go through their trials and detach amen and the face cycles circumstances and condition and come out victorious by the people that are made and ordained for this day that would be real soldiers of the cross and real warriors that know what god wants to do with the word they know their place in their position to understand amen what god has obtained and called them for for the hour is late but we're in translation time they make the shout has come forth they meant the force had called us to resurrection power for seven thunders out of their voice and when the seventh thunder's out of divorce john didn't say i sealed it up at the time of the until the time of the end but the time of the end has come and it depended again and the condos amen of the opening of the word it's here the book is open the seals have been broken the revelation is yours the sword is in your hand the king swore let's go forth to battle amen that day should not overtake you as a thief brother and sister be conscious be conscious people are got pain love is hard to find the purpose of the holy ghost when he said in romans 5 it said experience hope and hope maketh are not ashamed because the love of god is shedded abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost i believe we're so caught up in loving ourselves until we are protecting our feelings we're living in the sense realm when we should be living in the supernatural realm and the realm of faith children of faith but this is the coming of the lord he come to the thief in the night brothers sister we got to examine ourselves see whether we're in the faith or not do we have that agape love are we concerned about and having our pity party and somebody's holding our hand because we're crying about what we've been through what we're going through right and since it's time for us to pinch our conscience get a hold of god in a real way and get a vision for what god wants you to do the purpose in which you're here is to overcome the world to overcome the things of the world we're living in a time of isolation and separation folks have learned how to deal with isolation and separation they met everybody's they've even going to themselves and amen and they're saying we are isolating them we're separating it and and we'll protect it uh from uh the coronavirus and amen so we must say amen we must stay away we must stay away stay away from church stay away from one another amen because we are protected because we are together brother and sister i'm saying it's all right to do what god tells you to do amen but if god tell you what to do he'll tell you my word is my will god got a word for you and that word is life and god wants you to live be not deceived god is not mock so whatsoever man's soul that shall he also reap brother and sister the lord is coming at the thief in the night brothers sister that day will not catch you as a thief you're not of the darkness he said in the sixth verse therefore let us not sleep as do others waking up too late you know a lot of folks going to wake up and the lord has already come and gone as the prophet said that the lord have been come and gone and the two prophets of revelation 11 will be over in israel and they said i thought that the rapture would take place before moses and elijah appeared and the great tribulation period i thought that the rapture would take place first they'll wake up too late i'm going to tell you something brother and sister we cannot deceive ourselves in thinking that all is swell and all is well when our lives are not in order with the word brethren sister i'm saying let's get our houses in order let's get our lives where we're they're pleasing and acceptable in the sight of the lord but surely our lord would come and he's going to reckon with us and whatever's right he will pay so brother and sister we want to live a life that is pleasing and acceptable in his sight we want to hear him say well done my good and my faithful servant i want to hear his voice i know you say i love you lord but before you can love god you got to love your brother you got to love your sister and we cannot love the way god wants us to love except god be in us the bible says when christ was our life when he shall appear then we should be like him i said he's our life brother sister and when he come inside of us it's not you and i believe brother sister i was examining myself and i was not pleased with myself and i realized that it was more dying out that i must die out to i was so concerned about what i was feeling and what i was going through till i lost my focus that i should love you enough that i forget about my troubles my concern is amen a christian is one that lives for others and not for themselves anybody god servants say if we're a true christian and true believer we live for others not for ourselves but when we're so concerned about our feelings and ourselves we talk our conversations we've created a accept pity uh atlas fear that we live amen in sixth realm and we cannot live in a godly love capstone ministry headstone time amen because that is the realm amen why you amen forgive and you even understand that i'm one that have the power that god has invested in me he's forgiven me i can forgive my brother my sister my husband my wife my children my family i can't forgive why because you gotta give me love you must let that love flow from you that people can feel the love of god yes lord love brother the coming of the lord what's going to get you ready for his coming it's got to be a capstone the headstone is love charity you must come into that in a veil the true love of god that god can express his own attributes through your life that's the coming of the lord the lord got to come to you as individuals and he's got the cap he meant your life amen with perfect love and when the cats don't come to the body then the body is ready for rapture amen because he remain in love and love comes to meet love agape comes to meet with agape are you with me brother and sister as a thief in the night you must amen you must examine yourself and see that a little eleventh level to hold up the little foxes the spoiled vine brothers and sisters the little things in our lives that our faith that calls us to be unhappy that takes away our joy that destroys our peace and our sanity keep us worried and frustrated and they may have been out of proportion but we need to come to ourselves and let us look up for your redemption drawing now get your mind aiming out of this world and get your mind in heaven let me look up finally my brothers
