John the fourteenth chapter you know we're realizing I believe more and I believe it there's been a real wake-up call that we all understand that we knew we need God more than what we thought and everything everybody seems to be disturbed and shook up wondering what's gonna happen next and when is it all gonna end amen but I'll tell you something that you can trust in God it could be all over for you right now even because I believe God amen it came to give us something amen that we a man can be assured that no matter what happens or what common goals that a man you can have peace tonight mmm st. John 14 let's start there 15 first I wanna read down to the 26 if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father he should give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever I like that amen even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also and that day you should know that I am I am in the father and he and me in are you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him let's just stop read innocence pray father we thank you for the reading of your word law me you bless it and sanctify and in Jesus name Amen any man may be seated I'm gonna read this the 23rd verse in 24th verse you can be seated and Jesus also said him unto him if a man love me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keeping up my saying in the word what you hear is not mine but the father has sent me amen tonight I want to use for a little fault tonight I'm so reminded of the little thought that our brother Caleb had share with us a couple of weeks ago and it keeps ringing you know in my heart in my mind and I believe that each and every one of us I believe that when we hear you know the Word of God and I believe so many times that we we take it for granted what we hear but when it's something in it that seems to our awakening you and you know that we need certain things especially now it changes it more than just words off of a book or more than just saying that we hear it becomes reality and I think that's what we need more than anything we will come to church and we heard singing and we heard good preaching but we need reality now see just hearing something and feeling good and shouting and it is alright but we need a reality of what we hear we need a living guard down and just hearing sermons oh it's alright but if that servant don't come off the painted of the book and it don't quicking something in you and and cause you to draw closer to God then what good is the sermon oh yeah I'm gonna courage tonight and I want to encourage you tonight search I want you to be encouraged that our God the night I want to talk about your comforter and I believe we all know that we need a comforter the whole world I believe is realizing that it just isn't medicine but we need something that going to give us peace something that's going to keep us in the middle of a crisis or in the middle of your storm in the middle of there's a star we need a real comforter yes I minded that you know people use a lot of things for comfort them sometimes you know whether you're married or the husband become a comfortable wife and wife be a comfort to the husband and the children look to the parents for protection but oh now you need more than action you need something that's really gonna instill and stabilize you they give you an assurance that I need God yeah it's all right your depend on your wife and it's okay to depend on your parents but let me tell you something sometimes they can't even do what you need done and you're gonna need something that our letter is real a man not just our good little sayings are a good little words but you're gonna need a power something that is able whole you even when you don't want to hold yourself you need a comforter and I believe that's what God wants to do for us you know we we lean on people in and it's like that's all right in a sense and we have confidence in this women and all of this but let me tell you now we realize that it has to be something else now different than that I realize that and you realize to dad we can't even keep our own self it man our body get weakened all of us get sick from time to time and sometimes nobody really understand what's going on in your life but I'm so glad that God gave us a comforter he understands what's going on when when nobody else is around late at night and in the midnight hour one you seem to be your back against the wall and pressure from area Avenue becomes the attack your mind and you can just say all Jesus help me Lord and God promised to help us in a time of trouble comforter me I looked up the word comfort it means someone who helps you feel less worried unless upset and frightened and I believe that's what we need tonight we need us somebody to take away over the were in and fear because fear has torment but God want to give you peace he wants you to recognize that in a missile all going on I'm right here all you got to do is call on Jesus and he'll come to your rescue no matter what you're done I watch to going through he is a comfort really you know I'm glad to know tonight and I hope that all you can share it was me also a man that God a man has given you something not that you're boasting that you so big and you so strong no but it's God grace that's what we need or God is our that we need God grace is now or no need to look around friend don't get your eyes off the church off the good preacher look to the hills tonight that's where your help coming from really I feel real good tonight uh just looking and expecting even in the middle so what's going on I know that the life that I'm living now it's not because of me I'm not protecting myself I need a protector you need a protector the world need a protector we are ought to be calling old God Lord come see about us remember the sermon the pastor the preacher and he said return oh man I think that's what God want us to do I'm just wondering you know if we can just get back to God I mean really get back to God not not just Church and not just fall but let's really get back to God listen get call on God until he come and he wants to come by I believe you by saying if you draw nigh to him he'll draw nigh to you you know in prophesied that be st. John said this he said let not your heart be troubled come on about us Amen horse or failing for fear but God said don't let your heart be troubled why have you believed in me see he want us to trust him amen and we begin to trust God more than our jobs and more than our money and more than your success of this world are your earthly possession but trust him oh my I'm telling you just something you know that I was just looking at the comforter someone who helps you feel less worried and I know that there's a lot on people minds and and they are wondering you know what's gonna happen next so how I'm gonna come out of it and they're wondering you know what can I do to protect myself what do to reinsure that I won't get the virus with all Church I want to tell you tonight trust in the Lord with all thy might and rizal in that heart lean not water and understanding also in the book of Timothy it was saying that you know that how perilous times is going to come you know what I was thinking about the Bible as being one of the only books that can tell us the past in the future amen it can let us know what's going on in the world and why is all this following us but so many times we don't take the right heed to the word we look at as a being just old book that was written thousands of years ago and we failed to get the very tears of what the Word of God wills to do for us but when you look at the Baba's being a book of reality a book of prophecy and looking at you know the condition of the world and how the world is reacting and where we are going in by now I know that we heard it from years and years ago you know that the world is good ready to go it's coming to an end and we begin to see the signs at a time we begin to see the Matthew 24 and 7 how the Bible predict it man earthquakes and Kingdom against Kingdom and pestilence and all these they did about say these are only the beginning of Sorrows and that's what I thought about what brother kayla has shared if this is just the beginning what are we ought to be doing oh my look is just the beginning we can't hardly take it Lord to help us to get or something that would be able to keep us for whatever get rid of that happen next knows we need it I believe it's time that we ought to be really preparing ourselves don't take the things lightly let's take it seriously who knows what is gonna happen next and that's why he said let not your heart be troubled coz of you believe in me see it's important that we really believe in God in His Word amen oh want to just look at one little phrase here that I really one of the way lon in that 16th verse it says 14 14 he is saying and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and I like that something that I never leave you you know we leave a lot of things you know but god this comforter that he's talking about he wants to give you that it abide with you for ever when you don't even feel like you deserted he's still there I mean when everything else seems to for sukur and everybody else seemed to don't have nothing to do with you Jesus saying I'll be right there amen when you need a friend and you don't have a friend he'll be a friend with a little duckling in the dolls maiden that all he could do and he walked away shake his head then jesus said I'm the real doctor and I can heal all of your disease when I look at that when I look at doctor Jesus he got a proven record you know in his racket he never lost the case you know it is good to have good doctors and if you need a good doctor you were trying to find the best one you can because of his proven record a man his luck is sure that he's been very successful and the surgery that he does has been very you know a very technique and he do what he needs to do in his rating is high they have ratings you know but Jesus got a higher rating he specializes eat everything and there was nothing the Bible said there is nothing impossible with God and then I'll be the scriptures say one place is there no bar meaning Gideon is there no physician here he said it why they're the daughters of my people not healed Oh God is the healer he's the Great Physician yeah yeah bad with you forever I like that he just don't come when you come to church and leave you know one Tuesday or Wednesday and take a break no he dare when you're when you leave and when you come he's even there in your sleep amen and you know I mean sometime how we fight things in our sleep you know we were wrestle some time and and can't really arrest but all and you can get the comforter or the comforter can give you peace when you can't even sleep he's right there to ease all of us crests because people are stressful then so stressful they have to rely upon peels and rely upon all type of medication because nothing seems some time to even work sometimes even the medication be too strong or too weak and have a lot of side effects and it makes you feel worse in one area and good in another but if the comforter can ever abide and come in your heart oh he'll give you peace tonight I'll remind me of you turn a little bit quickly st. John still still talking about the comforter I hope tonight and pray that you will try this comforter and let him come into you tonight just don't go to church and just read a word but let the comforter come in a body see that comforter want to stay but you got to open up your heart and say Lord fill me give me this comforter like that woman is that the well that time she had tried a lot of things to comfort us and tried man you know the different feel how voting how hard and she met Jesus one day at that well it managed you'll be getting to talk to and find out will help problems at and and she been telling me he said you know go get your hug because she's I don't have no she see you said it right you had five and the one you with in none of you see she was looking for some type of confident she thought it was in a man but until she met the real man I believe that is the problem of people that when they go to church it's alright to go to church but you need to go to meet Jesus don't leave church every without meeting the person of Jesus Christ and invite him into your heart and let him take control or he want to control you not you can show him the problem a lot of times we we try to control God and God said no I'm the one need to be in control just move out of the way and let me come in have preeminence and that's what God trying to get us to let me have control of your life let let me come in and abide with you let let me just have all of your burdens and all of your cares come on I've been paid the price for it already just surrender your life to me and let me handle it what a comforter what a comfort especially the time like this amen we need a real comfort yeah we're saying in st. John's 16 I'll be coming to closing Saint John 16 I believe it's the seventh verse he said nevertheless I'll tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away if I go not away the comforter will not coming to you but if I depart I will sing him on to you you see God making it president he want the center comforter to you it's a personal invitation that God are you know won't Stu send a comforter but you have to let the comfort to come in so when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment a sin because they believe on me or a righteous because I go to my father and you see me no more see see he said one place that the world don't see me but you will see me see the world can't understand who this comforter is they think a lot of times that you know that they know how to comfort themselves through a substitution sometimes they try drugs and try all kind of forms to ease the mind to get some kind of relaxation and big release them from are always going on but oh that won't give you the right conflict you have to wake up and do the same thing the next day but if you ever let this real comfort to come in church I promise you and hereby there even in a missile crisis he'll give you peace god bless you tonight hope that era is something insane a man to be a blessing to you you see our past praise the Lord god bless you man said I'll give you another comforter amen praise God everything that folks trusted in and depended on standard jeopardy right now the whole world it's in its crisis and nothing that we have could give us peace right now because there's trouble everywhere there's uncertainty everywhere regard says in the midst of all these uncertain sounds there is a certain sound the Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he meant he's the same God he meant that meat away he meant when the Red Sea was in front of him he meant there was no way he could go Egyptian army behind them he meant but they had a God had a God they had experienced he meant that took them to amen the bondage of Egypt in he meant by victoriously he meant and when they cried out to God when it cried out God can't you see they met God knows our fiction and God with me cow he said ox entertain in my name he said I'll do it when you get in trouble he meant God is still present he meant can God help us in this condition he was able to help them man amen praise God it was a conference and assurance piece when God said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord brother and sister I don't know what what's your trouble about tonight but I thank God that he's the same I think God that there is he meant one that said I'll be your comforter I'll not only be with you but I'll be in here he meant I believe that God he meant that he meant open up the Red Sea he meant and made a way for the children Israel I said if you look over your life and so what God did for you yesterday him Savior look at Helia they meant because he said he was wounded for our transgressions sometimes it's difficult to Cusco God this Apollo said he'll be our comforter Oh all things amen god don't mess with it just let it be love you can deliver you from all things praise God the piece that we need tonight the piece that we stand in need of tonight if we allow God tonight to give us that piece amen the strength that we need right now tonight if we allow God to give us that strength praise God somebody needs to just press the song says press my way through is our brother going to sing she press my way through you can press your way through

Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in in keep pressing the battle it'll be all over after a while I was just praying and praying and praying it's many things we can say to you but if it ever was a time to pray is the time right now and I believe we are still trying to navigate our way through life but right now we need win treacherous waters and we need God to navigate us to this crisis we need God help in spite of what a all that's going on we need help from God I believe God can turn back he can turn things around for us even in your present distress we may not be victims of the virus but just life itself life itself has caused a lot of uncertainties and you need God to come and fix things for you you got to know that that God we serve knows how to do what we've been trying to do but we haven't come up with a solution we don't have a real answer to our problems but I say tonight in all your efforts and all your trying give it to Jesus and if you give it to Jesus then there
