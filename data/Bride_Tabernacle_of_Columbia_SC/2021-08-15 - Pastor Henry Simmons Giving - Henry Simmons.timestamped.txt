[33:42] says 6-1 take heed that
[33:45] you do not your arms before men to be
[33:48] seen of them
[33:50] otherwise ye have no reward of your
[33:54] father which is in heaven
[33:57] therefore
[33:58] when thou doest die in arms
[34:01] do not sound
[34:03] trumpet before thee
[34:05] as the hypocrites do
[34:08] in the synagogue
[34:10] and in the streets
[34:12] that they may be
[34:13] that they may have glory of men
[34:16] very i sanded you
[34:19] they have their reward
[34:22] but when i do with arms
[34:24] let not
[34:25] the right left hand knows what our right
[34:28] hand does
[34:31] that
[34:31] not arms may be
[34:33] in secret
[34:35] and our father which sees in
[34:39] secret himself shall reward thee openly
[34:44] god bless you read this word you may be
[34:46] seated
[34:51] the bible says there's more blessed to
[34:53] give than it is to receive
[34:58] we're living in one of the most
[35:00] blessed times and where people are more
[35:02] blessed than ever been blessed
[35:05] but we're also
[35:07] living in one of the most selfish
[35:10] age people of self-senate
[35:16] look like the more god gives the more
[35:18] selfish people become
[35:25] they think about
[35:27] like the rich man he built bigger bonds
[35:34] the
[35:34] second corinthians
[35:36] nine
[35:38] second corinthians nine and six
[35:40] second corinthians nine
[35:49] and six
[35:59] i just
[36:02] i just started reading at the third
[36:04] verse
[36:05] excuse me
[36:06] nine and six like
[36:09] okay
[36:10] nine and six okay but this i say
[36:13] he which so and sparingly
[36:16] shall reap also sparingly
[36:22] if you give a little you
[36:24] expect to receive a little
[36:27] are you with me
[36:30] he didn't source sparingly
[36:32] now you might think that i want to deal
[36:34] with
[36:36] your finances or whatever but
[36:40] i'm dealing with you as an individual
[36:44] how much are you giving god of
[36:46] yourselves
[36:49] i'm not dealing with
[36:52] but it's also if you want to look at
[36:55] that also
[36:56] then it's all right to look at that but
[36:59] i'm really looking at how much
[37:02] of god are we how much of you are you
[37:05] giving to god
[37:08] when we talk about giving to this this
[37:10] morning uh
[37:12] uh
[37:14] see some sometimes we
[37:17] we don't want to give god
[37:19] a hundred percent
[37:24] sometimes it's things that we don't want
[37:26] to give up we want to hold on to
[37:32] and i'm talking about giving
[37:34] are you giving him all
[37:36] your heart
[37:38] your mind
[37:40] your body your soul your spirit are you
[37:42] giving him everything
[37:46] are you giving him sparingly
[37:50] and you're reaping sparingly
[37:53] you don't really you can't comprehend
[37:57] all that the blessings that god has for
[37:59] you because you're not willing to let go
[38:03] there's no there's not enough room for
[38:05] him to bless you the way he wants to
[38:08] bless you
[38:10] because you got other things that are
[38:11] occupying
[38:13] the space where god wants to bless you
[38:17] so if the house is already filled if
[38:21] with something else then god cannot
[38:23] really
[38:24] show you the abundance of his grace and
[38:27] his blessings that he want to bestow
[38:28] upon your life because things are
[38:31] already there amen that he has no room
[38:37] are you with me
[38:39] so when we are preoccupied with the
[38:41] things of this world
[38:43] then god amen blessings that are
[38:47] spiritual blessings that he wants to
[38:49] restore upon our lives he cannot restore
[38:52] the spiritual blessings the things that
[38:54] he wants to do with our lives and things
[38:57] how he wants to use us how he wants to
[38:59] bless us he cannot fully do that until
[39:02] you're fully surrendered
[39:04] are you with me
[39:06] so sometimes we're not totally uh
[39:09] fully surrendered so god cannot fully
[39:12] bless us he can only bless us partially
[39:16] are you with me only that which you
[39:19] allows
[39:21] that which you're willing to
[39:23] surrender to
[39:25] are you with me
[39:26] and sometimes we surrender you know just
[39:29] enough
[39:30] just enough to be saved just enough to
[39:32] be a christian
[39:34] just enough
[39:37] you know to say i i you know i love you
[39:39] i'm you know i
[39:41] i'm faithful you know
[39:43] in our own little
[39:45] small way
[39:46] instead of getting abundancy of grace
[39:49] and abundancy of blessings we only get a
[39:52] portion of what god wants to give to us
[39:57] okay
[39:59] so he he deals with
[40:01] he that so is
[40:04] let me just try to teach this morning he
[40:07] did so sparingly
[40:09] shall reap also sparingly
[40:14] i don't know why we're looking for god
[40:16] to do great things in our lives if we're
[40:18] not willing
[40:20] and we're not we don't have room for it
[40:24] sometimes
[40:25] people want husbands wives and what
[40:27] other things but we don't have room for
[40:29] it
[40:31] the things that god would freely give to
[40:33] us we don't even have a room to receive
[40:35] it
[40:36] why because we're preoccupied
[40:39] we try to achieve and atta attain things
[40:42] on our own
[40:44] as long as you in god's way god cannot
[40:47] do it his way
[40:49] because you're already trying to do what
[40:52] your own way
[40:54] so how can we amen allow god to give us
[40:58] what he wants to give us when we gonna
[41:00] get what we want
[41:02] and gonna say god bless this is which i
[41:05] have
[41:06] i've gotten it for myself but i want
[41:08] your blessings to be upon this which i
[41:12] want
[41:14] instead of saying lord not my will but
[41:17] what
[41:18] see i it
[41:20] is whether or not we'll surrender and
[41:22] say you know
[41:24] it's more blessed to give when you're
[41:26] willing to give yourself
[41:28] completely you're willing to give over
[41:30] to god and you're willing to surrender
[41:33] completely to him
[41:35] you know it it's something to
[41:39] surrender partially
[41:41] you sparingly
[41:43] just a little
[41:45] uh lord
[41:47] you know we can say lord i'm
[41:48] surrendering to all of you but that's
[41:50] your smile i
[41:53] surrender
[41:54] not to renault
[41:56] but
[41:58] that's just a psalm
[42:01] that's just words
[42:03] but am i so have i have i really done
[42:06] that
[42:09] in my daily walk
[42:12] what am i sowing daily
[42:16] because each day we're sowing seeds
[42:20] our action is a
[42:22] sowing a seed
[42:24] you know even when we get up we're
[42:26] sowing seed
[42:27] you know the song says so good see
[42:31] and we're sowing and we're reaping the
[42:34] benefits of what we sow how we think
[42:37] when we get up
[42:39] our attitude
[42:42] you start off with a bad attitude
[42:45] we'll re
[42:46] during that day
[42:47] we're reaping what we sow
[42:50] our attitude we gotta get in a place
[42:52] where
[42:54] where we understand what we sow we reap
[42:58] and we're going to trust god when we get
[43:00] up and thank him for just so
[43:02] lovely day and thank you for all his
[43:05] blessings that he stole upon us and
[43:08] thank him oh god lord i thank you in
[43:10] advance amen for abundancy of grace and
[43:14] all your goodness amen i thank you for
[43:17] oh god blessing this day lord i thank
[43:20] you for waking up this morning
[43:23] with the attitude where you got room
[43:26] the room to reap amen
[43:29] because what
[43:31] you're giving thanks giving
[43:34] i'm giving thanks to you
[43:37] lord i i'm giving room for you
[43:41] and i want you to fill it up with your
[43:42] grace
[43:44] amen
[43:46] so you you realizing
[43:48] what you give
[43:49] is what you reap
[43:51] you reap what you sow
[43:55] okay
[43:57] so he says here
[44:02] if i sow
[44:04] bountifully i'll
[44:06] reap also bountifully
[44:09] not only in your natural giving
[44:12] amen
[44:14] you know
[44:15] you know i put down a name
[44:18] and sometimes i have to
[44:21] you god gives you people in your life
[44:23] and people in the fellowship
[44:25] that would remind you of people that go
[44:28] along with your sermon and i think about
[44:30] the carols for a long time the family
[44:34] that they were you know taking care of a
[44:38] major part of the finances and that's
[44:40] getting where we are today
[44:42] and for years they were you know major
[44:45] blessing
[44:47] but i understood that
[44:50] brother carol had in his mind if i give
[44:52] bountifully
[44:54] i'll reap bound to feel it
[44:56] and so he had that attitude giving
[44:59] bountifully and reaping bountifully amen
[45:03] and god blessed tremendously amen
[45:06] but
[45:07] now i'm dealing with attitude
[45:10] i'm not dealing with the natural
[45:13] i mean he was able to drive
[45:15] a bmw a mercedes this that all the
[45:19] different you know
[45:20] but i'm not dealing with that part i'm
[45:22] dealing with
[45:24] your your attitude towards your giving
[45:28] you see you must have the right attitude
[45:31] to what you're given
[45:33] okay so
[45:35] and because bad attitude given with the
[45:38] wrong attitude
[45:40] you know
[45:41] it's almost saying god should keep it
[45:44] coming to church and you're not
[45:47] coming with the right attitude
[45:50] you know you got to come into his
[45:51] presence
[45:53] amen come into his courts with praise
[45:56] amen you coming to give back to god what
[45:59] he gave to you
[46:02] if you're not coming to give back to god
[46:04] what he gave to you
[46:06] he gave you strength enough to come
[46:08] and when you get here you say thank you
[46:10] for the strength
[46:12] amen you know somebody's lying in the
[46:14] hospital somebody amen lying on a sick
[46:16] bed somebody can't even walk somebody
[46:18] can't talk
[46:20] somebody is just strung out and they
[46:22] can't even think
[46:25] but you want to give to god what he gave
[46:27] to you
[46:31] you know i tell folks all the time look
[46:33] at all your blessings don't look at all
[46:35] the negatives
[46:37] the bible said count your many blessings
[46:40] see what god has done why don't you
[46:42] count your blessings
[46:44] amen
[46:46] count your many blessings
[46:48] so you start counting your blessings not
[46:50] looking at all the failure and all the
[46:51] disappointment and all the trouble and
[46:54] all the stuff that's going wrong
[46:56] look at what's going counting your
[46:58] blessings
[47:00] you know i can see some people blind i
[47:02] can hear some people deaf i can feel
[47:05] some people
[47:06] paralyzed
[47:08] you know what i'm saying
[47:09] you know i account
[47:11] look at the positive and not the
[47:13] negative
[47:15] you know reaping giving
[47:18] reaping what you sow
[47:20] amen if you you become so negative
[47:23] you'll never be able you fill up with
[47:25] negativity you'll never be able to be
[47:28] blessed with the positive
[47:31] so things that are that are
[47:33] a negative in your life you got to turn
[47:36] the negative into a positive
[47:40] are you with me
[47:41] you got to start saying thank you lord
[47:44] i even thank you for the negative things
[47:47] that are happening because it's only
[47:49] going to take me to a positive
[47:52] are you with me
[47:54] i'm putting all my negative situations
[47:56] and only having a positive
[47:59] praise uh
[48:01] i don't know i'm trying to see with two
[48:03] negatives up
[48:05] what two negatives he could kill
[48:08] a negative
[48:12] negative and negative together
[48:14] amen
[48:16] i can't go back then that
[48:18] algebra or whatever it was
[48:21] but anyway
[48:22] you got to put
[48:25] the positive
[48:27] and take away the negative away
[48:30] are you with me
[48:33] and once you do that
[48:35] if you turn it around
[48:37] god will start blessing you
[48:40] and he'll bless you not just a little
[48:43] but as much as you allow
[48:46] as much as you allow god to bless you
[48:49] that's how much he'll bless you
[48:52] but if you only gonna allow god to bless
[48:54] you a little that's all you're gonna get
[48:56] is a little
[48:58] but if you allow him to bless you
[49:00] abundantly you're going to be blessed
[49:02] abundantly
[49:08] now
[49:15] he says
[49:16] every man according to
[49:19] as a purpose
[49:21] in his heart the seventh verse
[49:24] it's all about the heart
[49:27] where's your
[49:28] heart
[49:30] given
[49:31] from the heart
[49:36] giving from the heart giving
[49:38] because it's in your heart to do it
[49:42] now he says
[49:45] every man according has his purpose in
[49:47] his heart so let him what
[49:50] give
[49:53] you know a lot of things we do it
[49:54] because we think that we got to do what
[49:57] we doing and we don't want to do it we
[50:00] do it because mama say do it we do it
[50:03] because daddy said do it we do it
[50:05] because preachers say do it we do it
[50:07] because the word of god said do it we do
[50:10] it
[50:11] well we don't want to do it
[50:14] see a lot of things we do we don't want
[50:17] to do
[50:19] you see what i'm saying but when you
[50:22] want to do it it makes it easy
[50:27] it makes it so much better and easier
[50:30] when you want to do it
[50:33] you don't want to watch those dishes and
[50:35] make those dishes become dirty and they
[50:38] pile up and they pile up
[50:41] because you don't want to wash the
[50:42] dishes
[50:44] you don't want to take the trash out it
[50:46] gets big and get more and more trash
[50:48] you don't want to cut the grass it grows
[50:51] and grows
[50:53] isn't that right it's because you it it
[50:56] gets harder to cut
[50:58] because it's going to grow
[51:01] are you with me
[51:02] but it gets easier when you're willing
[51:06] when you don't mind it
[51:08] you go out there and you cut that grass
[51:10] and you keep it cut
[51:13] because you like the way your yard look
[51:15] when the grass is cut
[51:17] amen and that's the way it is you let a
[51:20] lot of weeds grow up in your spirit
[51:25] are you with me
[51:26] because why amen you you actually grudge
[51:30] and you ah
[51:33] oh i don't want to do okay
[51:37] but when you're willing you feel better
[51:41] you got the right attitude you feel like
[51:43] doing it
[51:46] praise god you know nobody until your
[51:48] mind gets
[51:49] right that you you love god you want to
[51:52] worship god you want to serve god as
[51:54] long as that negative thing is there
[51:57] you know uh as long as you don't want to
[52:00] give
[52:02] you don't want to give god your heart
[52:04] you don't want to get you know it's
[52:06] about that hard you don't want to give
[52:07] him your heart
[52:09] then it's a grudge
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] it's a strain
[52:13] you know
[52:14] you don't want to give him your heart
[52:17] and somebody said let's praise the lord
[52:18] you say
[52:23] you're looking all around
[52:25] praise the lord
[52:28] they say well let's do this let's go
[52:30] play some ball hey
[52:34] your heart is in the ball your heart is
[52:36] not in god
[52:38] let's go do this so let's go do that
[52:41] that's where my heart is
[52:43] are you with me
[52:45] and you sow to that
[52:47] you reap that
[52:49] but if you sow to god then you'll find
[52:52] that god becomes so real to you
[52:56] amen reaping what you want
[52:59] what you give to god amen that's all
[53:02] you're getting sparingly you get a
[53:04] little man i tried to serve god i tried
[53:08] to do this and i tried to do that that's
[53:10] only your
[53:12] efforts amen it's not him that willing
[53:16] to him that run it but it's god that
[53:18] shows the mercy
[53:20] are you with me
[53:23] you know
[53:24] oh all you got to do surrender lord thy
[53:27] are the potter i am the clay roll me and
[53:31] make me what you want to do
[53:35] amen how you want and what you want out
[53:38] of me lord here i am
[53:44] this is oh god
[53:46] are you with me
[53:48] if you're willing to surrender
[53:50] if you're willing to allow him to make
[53:53] you
[53:55] amen what he wants you to be
[53:58] then you can
[53:59] get ready for your abundance of
[54:02] blessings
[54:06] okay
[54:07] it says
[54:08] grudgingly he did
[54:12] according to as a purpose in his heart
[54:14] so let him give
[54:16] not grudgingly all of what
[54:19] necessity you know i give but i
[54:23] i need it in myself
[54:25] so i
[54:28] you know
[54:29] not a necessity
[54:33] for god love is the word
[54:38] i'm going to tell you something
[54:40] you must realize
[54:43] that only what you do willingly
[54:46] and from the heart
[54:49] and you're glad to do it
[54:51] is going to count
[54:54] and got
[54:56] in god
[54:58] amen
[55:00] singing is all right but if you're not
[55:02] doing it from the heart
[55:04] and you're loving to do it and you're
[55:06] doing it to the glory of god
[55:08] see those others that we read in matthew
[55:11] they did
[55:13] only to be seen the praise of men
[55:17] that's what matthew was all about right
[55:20] yeah yeah they did it they wanted the
[55:22] glory of men they wanted to be seen a
[55:25] man they want to show out
[55:28] amen
[55:29] in our christian walk it's not about us
[55:33] amen a christian
[55:36] life is
[55:38] uh to live for what
[55:41] to live for others
[55:43] not to live unto yourselves but to live
[55:45] for others that's what a christian life
[55:47] is all about living for others not for
[55:50] yourself
[55:51] are you with me
[55:56] jesus christ was our perfect example
[55:59] i got to get down here where i can close
[56:02] out in a minute because i don't purpose
[56:04] to hold you along this morning okay you
[56:07] said
[56:09] and god is able
[56:10] to make all grace abound towards you
[56:14] that ye always having all sufficiency
[56:18] and all things
[56:20] may abound
[56:22] in every what
[56:25] good work see what i'm saying
[56:27] so in every good word god god's going to
[56:30] bless you
[56:34] and make you abound in every good word
[56:37] because your attitude towards giving
[56:40] because your heart is in it
[56:42] so every you know
[56:44] everything you put your hands to god's
[56:47] gonna bless it everything
[56:49] amen that a child of god put his hand to
[56:52] god said i'm a blessing
[56:54] i don't care what you do
[56:57] amen if you do it as unto the glory of
[57:00] god god's gonna bless you
[57:03] god gonna bless your efforts in
[57:04] everything you do
[57:06] all you gotta do is sow
[57:09] good seed
[57:11] amen
[57:12] give
[57:13] with the right spirit
[57:15] give from your heart
[57:18] and god is going to bless you abundantly
[57:22] now i said all that to say this
[57:25] in um saint john 17.
[57:28] saint john 17.
[57:30] i needed to read the whole chapter but i
[57:32] can't do that so i just move right on to
[57:35] the ninth verse amen
[57:37] i want you to know
[57:39] that god's purpose
[57:41] he showed us perfect example in himself
[57:44] that he gave himself for us
[57:47] the bible said god amen the wages of sin
[57:50] is death but the gift of god is eternal
[57:51] life
[57:53] now how do we get eternal life it's only
[57:55] through him giving
[57:57] we get eternal life because god gave
[58:01] himself
[58:02] for us that we might receive eternal
[58:04] life isn't that right
[58:06] so it took it took giving
[58:09] for us to receive eternal life
[58:11] and in turn when we receive eternal life
[58:16] we must impart back what god has given
[58:19] to us
[58:20] and if god has given you eternal life
[58:22] then you can impart that back how do you
[58:25] do that
[58:27] all that the father gave me i'm giving
[58:30] i give it to you
[58:32] oh you look man
[58:34] so how are you doing that amen he said
[58:36] if i be lifted up then i what
[58:39] i draw all men unto me amen
[58:42] and i wonder who would help me
[58:44] look jesus isn't that right
[58:47] god amen has invested in you and he has
[58:51] endowed you he's in he's he's put
[58:55] something inside of you
[58:57] and that
[58:58] that's not just something that's
[59:01] his very person inside of you
[59:04] his very life inside of you
[59:08] amen that you might have life more uh
[59:13] abundantly
[59:15] are you with me
[59:17] so oh
[59:18] and i don't want you to take this life
[59:21] amen that god has given you amen and not
[59:24] give it because he
[59:26] gave it to you
[59:28] god bless you to be a blessing
[59:32] now y'all sitting close enough to one
[59:34] another's that your family members
[59:36] just tell somebody god bless you
[59:40] to be a blessing
[59:43] what god bless you know
[59:45] it's something about
[59:47] the in the minute a person is filled
[59:49] with the spirit the bible says you will
[59:51] be witnesses of me
[59:53] you want to tell somebody you want to
[59:55] amen
[59:56] the blessing that god has bestowed upon

[1:04:00] something it's not no coincidence
[1:04:03] god know each and every one of us and he
[1:04:05] knew who belonged to him
[1:04:08] are you with me
[1:04:10] so he said i pray not for the world
[1:04:13] are you with me
[1:04:15] the bible tells us the word love is what
[1:04:17] the world loves his own son i'm not
[1:04:19] praying to the word those folks out
[1:04:21] there that's doing all kind of stuff the
[1:04:22] world love his own
[1:04:26] so jesus said i don't i don't pray for
[1:04:28] the world
[1:04:31] are you with me
[1:04:35] god so loved the world
[1:04:38] but it comes down to a place that
[1:04:41] he's in his agony and he's in his
[1:04:44] mediation
[1:04:46] mutatorial
[1:04:47] point and he's praying
[1:04:50] amen it's getting ready to leave
[1:04:53] and he says i pray not for the world

[1:05:05] and thine uh what
[1:05:08] and i am
[1:05:10] glorified where

[1:05:18] but these are
[1:05:22] and i come to thee
[1:05:25] holy father
[1:05:27] keep through thy own name those whom
[1:05:30] thou has what
[1:05:33] see
[1:05:34] god has given to you
[1:05:37] only to give back what he gave to you
[1:05:42] don't hold it as though you possess it
[1:05:44] and it belongs to you
[1:05:46] like
[1:05:47] that
[1:05:49] you can become selfish
[1:05:53] and you hold your fist so tight
[1:05:57] that you're not willing to lose
[1:05:59] and give it
[1:06:03] okay it says
[1:06:10] all done of mine and
[1:06:16] eleventh verse she says and now i'm no
[1:06:19] more in the world

[1:06:30] those that thou
[1:06:33] gave me amen
[1:06:38] those that i gave me
[1:06:45] hallelujah
[1:06:47] and none of them is lost
[1:06:49] but the son of what
[1:06:53] that the scriptures might be what
[1:06:56] and now i come to thee
[1:06:59] and these
[1:07:00] things i speak
[1:07:03] in the world
[1:07:05] that they might have
[1:07:07] my what
[1:07:09] fulfilled in themselves
[1:07:13] i have given them
[1:07:16] by what
[1:07:18] and the world
[1:07:20] has
[1:07:22] what the world did
[1:07:26] i know you seeking for love
[1:07:29] we seek for love in the wrong places
[1:07:34] we want
[1:07:36] we're seeking for the wrong kind of love
[1:07:39] and a lot of folks know how to give you
[1:07:41] the kind of love
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:47] that kind of love that people think they
[1:07:50] need they got to have
[1:07:53] and they get that kind of love but the
[1:07:56] love that god wants to give you
[1:07:59] is his
[1:08:01] kind of love and the world can't give
[1:08:02] you that kind of love
[1:08:04] so don't try to reach out then you know
[1:08:07] you feel left out you feel
[1:08:09] but you're not

[1:08:29] but god got a new
[1:08:31] heaven and a new earth
[1:08:34] prepared for you
[1:08:36] it's waiting on you but you got to be
[1:08:39] willing to receive it
[1:08:42] if you don't if you don't open up and
[1:08:44] and say god i want this
[1:08:46] this new creation this new
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:52] god made everything for adam
[1:08:55] and eve
[1:08:57] and he gave them to be the god of this
[1:08:59] earth
[1:09:02] and god said i'll prepare a place for
[1:09:04] you
[1:09:06] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:09:10] god got a place prepared for you
[1:09:15] and he already knows that you
[1:09:18] amen something in you
[1:09:20] desire in that place
[1:09:23] he says
[1:09:27] the world hates hate them because
[1:09:30] they are not of the world
[1:09:33] even as i'm not of the world
[1:09:36] i pray not
[1:09:37] that thou should
[1:09:39] take them out of the world
[1:09:41] but thou should keep them from the evil
[1:09:46] they are not of
[1:09:48] the world
[1:09:50] even as i'm not of the world
[1:09:53] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[1:09:55] is truth
[1:09:57] as thou has sent me into the world
[1:10:01] even so have i
[1:10:04] also sent them into the world
[1:10:07] and for their sakes
[1:10:10] i sanctify myself
[1:10:12] that they also might be sanctified
[1:10:15] through thy truth
[1:10:17] neither pray out for these
[1:10:20] alone
[1:10:21] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:10:25] me
[1:10:26] through what
[1:10:29] see you're not just
[1:10:31] believing for yourself
[1:10:34] to believe on me through their words
[1:10:38] their people out there are waiting on
[1:10:41] your word
[1:10:43] waiting on you
[1:10:45] to tell them
[1:10:47] the gospel of jesus christ
[1:10:50] they're waiting there there are people
[1:10:52] that you sat around you play with you go
[1:10:54] to school where you go to work with
[1:10:56] they're waiting on you
[1:11:00] just to give them a word
[1:11:03] and sometimes we're so
[1:11:05] busy
[1:11:07] reaping of the world till we don't have
[1:11:09] time
[1:11:12] sowing our seeds
[1:11:16] we're so busy
[1:11:18] till we're not in tune with the spirit
[1:11:22] we're not in tune with god we're not
[1:11:24] listening to him
[1:11:28] and sometimes you don't have to quote a
[1:11:30] scripture and you don't even have to say
[1:11:32] jesus love you amen but in your spirit
[1:11:35] you begin to be sensitive amen that this
[1:11:38] person needs god and used to begin to
[1:11:40] pray and then amen after a while things
[1:11:43] began to change in that person's life
[1:11:45] after a while you began to see you
[1:11:47] didn't open your mouth but you opened up
[1:11:49] your spirit and you were able to be used
[1:11:52] to
[1:11:53] by god
[1:11:56] what did you do you start giving
[1:12:00] you stop being selfish
[1:12:02] amen everything self-centered everything
[1:12:05] about what i'm trying to achieve and
[1:12:07] what i'm trying to do you start caring
[1:12:09] about somebody else
[1:12:12] jesus amen he could have cared about
[1:12:14] himself but he cared more about you than
[1:12:17] he cared about his own life
[1:12:20] he was more interested in you and i than
[1:12:24] he was with his own self
[1:12:27] and i'm saying to you amen god amen
[1:12:30] wants you to be interested in someone
[1:12:34] else more than you're interested in your
[1:12:36] own
[1:12:38] praise god given
[1:12:42] that god can give you
[1:12:46] more
[1:12:51] said about the rich
[1:12:53] man how hardly can a rich man enter the
[1:12:55] kingdom of heaven
[1:12:57] said harder for a camera to go through
[1:12:59] the eyes of a needle then the rich man
[1:13:02] entered the kingdom of heaven isn't that
[1:13:03] right
[1:13:05] and you know a lot of times they said
[1:13:07] the eye of a kneeler was
[1:13:10] going into the gates of the city the
[1:13:12] camel
[1:13:13] going in he had to get down on his knees
[1:13:16] to get through
[1:13:17] the gate
[1:13:20] so
[1:13:21] he says that was the eye of the needle
[1:13:23] they were saying that
[1:13:25] so he had to get down on his knees and
[1:13:27] crawl through because he was too tall
[1:13:30] are you with me
[1:13:32] but he says
[1:13:35] the disciples said lord we left all to
[1:13:37] follow you
[1:13:39] he said no man is left on see what i'm
[1:13:41] saying

[1:13:46] i really give god my life i'll really
[1:13:48] give god my all
[1:13:50] then

[1:14:45] to become a millionaire you might become
[1:14:46] a
[1:14:47] a hunting there
[1:14:51] you know what i'm saying maybe a
[1:14:52] thousand there never become that
[1:14:54] millionaire
[1:14:55] but with god
[1:14:56] amen praise god your potential he knows
[1:14:59] your potential

[1:15:05] god is able to make that 100 million
[1:15:08] amen that's what you would have had if
[1:15:11] you don't say if i would have pursued my
[1:15:13] vision
[1:15:15] but i'm going to tell you something if
[1:15:16] you give them your vision for the vision
[1:15:18] of god
[1:15:20] if you give up what you want for what
[1:15:22] god wants you to have
[1:15:25] amen but we're not willing to believe
[1:15:28] that god knows what's best for us and
[1:15:31] god has more for us than we can ever
[1:15:33] imagine
[1:15:37] more than we can ever ask or think
[1:15:40] far beyond our comprehension
[1:15:43] god has more
[1:15:46] and god wants to give you more
[1:15:49] god wants to give you more abundance
[1:15:52] god wants to bless you abundantly
[1:15:55] amen if you only allow him to do it
[1:15:59] praise god with your father beyond all

[1:16:17] we so sparingly
[1:16:20] and sometimes we we're blessed but not
[1:16:23] to
[1:16:24] not to the point that amen we could be
[1:16:26] blessed
[1:16:27] as long as we got a little blessings we
[1:16:30] think that we're really prospering
[1:16:33] prospering was down amen
[1:16:36] it's almost approximately we
[1:16:38] we're not saying we don't have god at
[1:16:40] all we think that we have a potion of
[1:16:42] god and that's all we need to to get
[1:16:46] what we want
[1:16:48] and to accomplish that which we want to
[1:16:50] achieve
[1:16:52] so as long as we got a little bit of god
[1:16:55] maybe some of the the the
[1:16:57] the great uh professional people in this
[1:17:00] world they meant to have a accomplished
[1:17:03] immense uh a billion dollars

[1:17:17] amen if one soul is worth more than 10
[1:17:20] 000 worlds

[1:17:51] invest towards god they're so good seed
[1:17:56] amen they sow into the kingdom of god

[1:20:41] jesus prayed that we be
[1:20:44] one amen in order to become one you must
[1:20:48] make a sacrifice
[1:20:50] on the day of pentecost the bible said
[1:20:53] they were on one accord in one place
[1:20:55] suddenly there came a sign from heaven
[1:20:57] as a rich and mighty wind
[1:20:59] and they fill all the house where they
[1:21:01] were sitting and they appeared unto them
[1:21:02] clothed in tongues like as a fire
[1:21:05] and it sat upon each of them
[1:21:07] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:21:08] ghost and began to speak with other
[1:21:10] tongues
[1:21:12] amen i'ma tell you they came to a place
[1:21:16] where god had filled them with the
[1:21:18] spirit
[1:21:20] and then once
[1:21:21] they were filled with the spirit
[1:21:23] men looked at them and said these men
[1:21:25] are full of new wine but he said these
[1:21:27] men are not drunk unless you suppose
[1:21:29] seen it's but the third hour of the day
[1:21:31] but this is that which is spoken of by
[1:21:33] the prophet joel that in the last days
[1:21:36] said god that i poured my spirit upon
[1:21:38] all flesh
[1:21:40] sons and daughters shall prophesy and
[1:21:41] young mentions see vision their old men
[1:21:44] should dream dreams and all my servant
[1:21:46] and all my handmaids in those days when
[1:21:48] i poured my spirit and i show wonders in
[1:21:51] heaven above and signs and earth beneath
[1:21:53] blood and fire and vapors of smoke the
[1:21:55] sun should be turned into darkness and
[1:21:57] the moon and the blood
[1:21:59] before the great and notable day of the
[1:22:01] lord come
[1:22:02] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:22:05] shall call upon the name of the lord
[1:22:06] shall be saved
[1:22:08] i wonder what you're calling this
[1:22:10] morning
[1:22:11] i wonder if you have enough grace in
[1:22:13] your heart to call on him why he can't
[1:22:16] be found
[1:22:18] are you willing to sow good seed are you
[1:22:20] willing to reach out into the debt and
[1:22:22] say god i want to call on you while i
[1:22:25] can
[1:22:26] because one day it's going to be a dark
[1:22:28] and a great dreadful day
[1:22:30] and men would call and they would cry
[1:22:32] out to the rocks in the mountains and
[1:22:34] they shall fall on his heart as from the
[1:22:36] face of him that satisf upon the throne
[1:22:38] because the wrath of god will be pulled
[1:22:40] out
[1:22:42] well brother and sister you have an
[1:22:43] opportunity to make your call in an

[1:25:37] mind to come on one accord with god
[1:25:41] and that's to become a one accord with
[1:25:43] his word

[1:28:17] trying to do things in your life but
[1:28:20] you're being so watchful and so careful

[1:28:26] god wants you to lose your mind and have
[1:28:29] the mind of christ

[1:29:02] protecting yourself you live every day
[1:29:05] you're on god

[1:29:09] got to be
[1:29:12] brothers and sisters it's time it's
[1:29:14] about freely giving
[1:29:16] be willing to be abused
[1:29:19] be willing to be used
[1:29:23] jesus christ amen
[1:29:25] and all that he done for the people they
[1:29:26] still treated him
[1:29:29] they still treated him they didn't they
[1:29:31] didn't care for him
[1:29:34] after all the good that he's done looked
[1:29:35] like they would have loved him and
[1:29:36] appreciated him right
[1:29:38] no they wanted him dead
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:43] he said the world will hate you
[1:29:46] are you with me
[1:29:49] but you got to continually what you got
[1:29:52] to
[1:29:53] continually humble yourself and give
[1:29:57] give
[1:29:58] amen because the life that he's given
[1:30:00] you
[1:30:01] amen is eternal life
[1:30:03] give it freely
[1:30:05] willingly
[1:30:06] not grudgingly don't hold back
[1:30:10] hey the way you've been thinking forget
[1:30:12] it brother
[1:30:14] i know you don't like me but forget it i
[1:30:17] love you anyhow
[1:30:19] i know you don't care for me but i don't
[1:30:21] that's not bothering me i love you
[1:30:25] you know sometimes we hold back we hold
[1:30:28] back
[1:30:29] the brother don't care for me so i don't
[1:30:31] care for him either that sister don't
[1:30:33] care for me well
[1:30:35] just let it go ahead on
[1:30:37] i'm going to tell you something
[1:30:39] and that's the way the devil would have
[1:30:40] it to be
[1:30:42] have you so separated even in a house of
[1:30:44] family
[1:30:45] you got the same mama same daddy
[1:30:51] look at how they treating her
[1:30:52] look how to treat me
[1:30:55] you know what i'm saying
[1:30:56] same house
[1:30:58] oh she getting all the attention
[1:31:00] you know what i'm saying
[1:31:02] i mean same mama same daddy
[1:31:04] if it happens in a natural house upon
[1:31:07] natural children how about in the
[1:31:09] spiritual in the church
[1:31:11] sometimes to what we see amen you got to
[1:31:14] forget about all of that look at joseph
[1:31:15] and his brothers
[1:31:17] oh he came over by joseph didn't care
[1:31:19] about all of us look at all of us and he
[1:31:21] cared more about that one than he cared
[1:31:23] about all of us
[1:31:25] maybe god put it that way
[1:31:29] you know what you're going to do about
[1:31:30] it
[1:31:31] are you going to respond like they did
[1:31:34] joseph
[1:31:38] i don't say
[1:31:39] come on
[1:31:41] don't worry about it just go do your
[1:31:43] part and what god gave you to do amen
[1:31:46] and do it amen
[1:31:48] know your position know your place amen
[1:31:52] because
[1:31:53] it it's going to always be that the
[1:31:56] devil is always going to inject things
[1:31:58] to make things look like amen
[1:32:02] it may not be that way
[1:32:05] are you look man
[1:32:06] well because we're dealing with the
[1:32:08] devil and we allow him to sow amen that
[1:32:11] wrong seed down in us that wrong thought
[1:32:14] amen then it'll bring forth amen fruits
[1:32:18] and those fruits amen we'll reap what we
[1:32:21] want
[1:32:22] so the devil the enemy
[1:32:25] has sown that seed isn't that right
[1:32:28] who did it amen one man slept the enemy
[1:32:31] that sold it was the devil he sold tears
[1:32:34] in the field
[1:32:36] oh you look man
[1:32:38] that was friday night he sold tares
[1:32:42] in the right
[1:32:43] so the enemy did that
[1:32:45] now not your brother not your sister not
[1:32:48] joseph joseph didn't do anything but the
[1:32:50] enemy's so terrors
[1:32:54] wrong thoughts
[1:32:57] then they began to get a spirit of what
[1:32:59] jealousy
[1:33:02] and they carried out what they thought
[1:33:05] amen
[1:33:07] joseph was
[1:33:10] without even consciously
[1:33:13] considering that was their brother
[1:33:17] and god had given him a gift to deliver
[1:33:19] them
[1:33:22] they could not see the blessings that
[1:33:24] joseph was to be to them
[1:33:27] but they became jealous of him instead
[1:33:29] of recognizing the blessing
[1:33:33] are you up man
[1:33:35] but joseph had to go through that
[1:33:38] so brother and sister don't you worry
[1:33:40] about if god has made you a joseph
[1:33:45] praise god then don't try to take
[1:33:47] vengeance on your brother or sister
[1:33:52] praise god don't you try to sow amen
[1:33:57] don't let the devil inject you with
[1:34:01] something that's gonna cause you to look
[1:34:04] at your brother's sister wrong
[1:34:08] amen praise god cast down every
[1:34:10] imagination and everything that's
[1:34:14] contrary
[1:34:15] and
[1:34:16] love the love of god be there
[1:34:21] i gotta close but be one
[1:34:24] the devil is
[1:34:25] divine
[1:34:26] divide and conquer
[1:34:29] your divide
[1:34:30] and he'll keep dividing and he'll keep
[1:34:33] you divided
[1:34:34] but love one another
[1:34:37] for love is of god
[1:34:39] and everyone that love
[1:34:41] is born of god
[1:34:43] are you with me
