you we thank you for all things as we look to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] the book of second corinthians fourth chapter we and i'll read the first you read the next we read the last verse together the god of this evil age it says therefore sin we have this ministry as we receive mercy we faint not too it is here to them that are laws for for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servant for jesus sake six but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the ethnicity of the power may be of god and not of us 8. persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed 10. for we which uh live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifested in our martyr flesh 12. we have the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak 14. for all things are for your sake that the abundance of grace might through the thanksgiving of many renown to the glory of god 16. for our light affliction which is but for a moment work is for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 18 together while we look not at the things that are seen but the things which are not seen but the things which are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal that god bless you towards me be seated you know i was on the other day i was looking at eternity and and the eternal things amen but by the grace of god and now and just imagine how long eternity is and when did eternity began and when does it end and we know that eternity speaks of no beginning and no end and to have eternal life means that praise god as we look at eternal life we're looking at god's life amen and if we have god's life inside of us in amen we are born again amen we have the holy ghost and that is eternal life praise god and knowing that just you know just before we just get into the subject i was just thinking on that you know having eternal life what it really entails what it really means to you and i to have eternal life praise god what would a man give in exchange for eternal life what would a man i i mean this world don't mean nothing when we we compare it to eternal life you know when the men get down to the last i don't care if they got a billion dollars i don't care if they're or whatever but when it comes down to dying they meant their money their billions mean nothing their trillions mean nothing amen because amen life is more than that to die you lose it all amen but if you die in christ you're gained amen amen so by the grace of god as we look this uh this morning that the god of this evil age it's two forces it's two opposing spirits that we're looking at this morning it's um god in the devil amen these opposing spirits they're against one another amen amen and seeing that we have two opposing spirits we look at who's in control amen who's in control the god of this evil age who's in control and as we look at our lives we're made up of body soul and spirit and here the prophet of god said outside man is the physical being which is controlled by six senses five senses uh on five five cent the outside man controlled by the five senses amen the inside man amen we know it's controlled by five senses conscious memory imagination and so forth amen but as the outside man has taste feel uh smell and hear and so forth we look at that and we we see who's in really in control but we look down a little deeper and um inside the spirit uh is the soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will amen amen you can accept what the devil says or you can accept what god says that determines what spirit is in there if the spirit of god it will feed on the things of god amen and if it won't or anything of this world amen jesus said if you love the world the love of the father is not in you isn't that right so what happens is what you're feeding them what your desires is all about amen if a man loved the world the love of the father is not in him amen are you with me but when you love god you want the will of god to be in your life amen you want to please god amen and these uh these forces these two spirits opposing forces the devil amen is fighting against god amen you have a free will you can choose which one you want to be in control of your life if you want the devil but the devil works in a a very deceptive manner and because the devil is so deceiving then i i i find that because the devil is so deceiving folks are being led in the era of the wicked and not even though they're being laid here it says here in romans 8 let's just look at romans 8 and um 14 romans 8 and 14. now i want to be led by the spirit of god how about you i want to be led by god's spirit amen and if we are laughed by god's spirit amen then god tells us here and says for as many as the land by the spirit of god they are the what the sons of god now if we are amen if we don't want correction and we don't see people are actually victims of evil spirits and they don't even know and that's why sometimes you and i as christians and as people that love the lord and and have the baptism of the holy ghost sometimes we're not uh really compassionate enough to understand that we must be patient with those that are in error amen amen amen sometimes we don't have enough patience here in the second timothy i i was just looking at the husband is the head of the wife isn't that right and if the husband is the head of the wife then christ is the head of the church and he's the head of the bride are you with me amen so christ is the head of the church the husband is the head of the wife isn't it now your head determines where your body goes amen amen are you with me your head leaves your body the church is the body of christ the head is christ isn't that right and when your body goes when he leaves me i'll follow now who's in control of your life it shows amen how you being led [Music] are you with me so here and and second corinthians two here second corinthians two i hope caleb you got me a little bit uh i may want second corinthians two and twenty-two two and twenty-two god is good amen the head of the body amen and i was just looking at people are not married to the word they're married they meant to their own cells are you with me people are not being led by their husband which is christ who is the word they're being led by their own selfish desire and that's not really theirs they're being deceived by another spirit amen amen the spirit of deception that works in people's lives and the bible said uh there'll be deceivers and they'll deceive their own self amen so the the devil wants you to think that you are in control that's the greatest thing the devil makes you believe that you're in control of what you're doing but actually a person actually is taken captive amen actually a person is a victim of circumstances amen it's because amen even listen to the devil's lie is because amen she listened to the devil interpretation of the word amen when the word was plain thou shall not touch god should not eat of the tree of knowledge and good and evil if the day you eat you're gonna die [Music] but the devil told her you can eat and you won't die amen are you with me and the devil tell you it's all right to eat and not die it's all right to do what you're doing it ain't gonna do you no harm so if a person really believed that it was poison that they were eating up they wouldn't eat it amen and we know eating is not barely eating as a uh are you eating a pie or eating some fried chicken but he named that praise god he said such is the way of a daughter's woman she eat it and wipes her mouth and she says i've done nothing amen are you with me so eating uh many of times has to do amen with uh amen your decision that you're making amen and we can see the fruits amen praise god we can see the what's been manifested in your life whether or not you'll are in bondage see when they eve did what she did when god when god came in the cool of the evening adam and eve was hiding why because they understood that they had disobeyed god and because they were disobeying god they meant then they really they feared and they tried to cover it up amen amen brother and sister now here in uh second corinthians 2 and 22 it says here what caleb please flee also youthful lust okay it's a thing we call youthful lust fleeing that's why young people you got to flee it you know so a lot of times young people are not conscious and god said to timothy i know you're saved and i know you you know servant of god and and paul had a lot of confidence in timothy and timothy but he told timothy i want you to watch something i want you to flee you for lust amen because all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life and i want you to flee amen because you can get caught up if you're not careful so i'm trying to warn you timothy flee you for less instead of the war against your members isn't that right he said flee it amen and maybe i'll get you how do you know amen uh uh what do you flee from you for lust go ahead ii timothy 2 flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness it's calling what you're following it's very important that you follow righteousness you know if you don't follow righteousness you're going to be a victim of youthful lust amen young people hear me amen if you don't flee you for lust then you're going to be a victim amen amen amen if you if you don't want to follow righteousness if you don't make up your mind i want to live right i want to do right praise god but follow righteousness but see sometimes you know we don't want to do we don't want to follow jesus we don't want to follow the things that are right we don't want to be led by the spirit which is leading us to the words amen it shows that our husband is in we're in subjection to our husband the headship of the word amen amen are you up there amen and when we're in subjection to the headship of the word then we flee from you for us and we follow righteousness amen are you with me amen go ahead faith charity faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart see it's something about calling on the lord out of a pure heart once satan had corrupted adam and eve they made their heart one pure no more amen amen david said that word have a hit in my heart that i might not sinners when your heart is pure when you know the word is anchored there you can call on a god out of a pure heart amen amen i thank god for the prophet he's talking about the god vindicates the word for the hour the message of the hour god will vindicate the word they meant that god is allotted for this age amen he said no other age there's satan amen been the god of the age but this age are you with me so by the grace of god we we're fighting a a a a crafty devil that if it was possible he deceived the very leg so the god of this evil age brother sister amen if i were you i wouldn't listen to him not one day amen amen amen i'll flee amen amen praise god let me lead me to the rock that is higher you know god i want to i want to be in your word i want to be anchored oh god what would cause a young person to want to love god with all their heart because they know god will take care i said he'll take care of you amen god will do you good and not evil hallelujah he'll bless you going in in your core oh god want to bless you more than you can heaven attain anything in this world for yourself god will do good do you good and not evil praise god i want god amen because i want the blessings that god has for me amen i i want god to amen control my life because i know i'm in the right hands i'm in the hands of god and if he's in control of my life i know i'm gonna be all right amen if i let god control me i'm willing to yield to god i'm willing to trust you with my life god i'm willing to say i'm yours lord [Music] i'm yours lord hallelujah y'all don't mind being yours oh god i don't mind you being in control a pure heart brother and sister amen he said blessed are the pure and heart for they shall what they should see god amen you can call on god you know when sin is there you calling on god but it ain't out of pure heart because you're doing all kind of stuff and huh he said praise god amen the firm and proud of a righteous man avail as much are you with me but here we people have got the attitude they live in a kind of way and they call upon god to god heard my prayer god thank god for hearing you blessed be the name of the lord but the bible say god he is not sinners amen but whosoever be a worship of him that that's what we hear isn't that right but here we are sinners just calling on the name of the lord out of an evil heart and doing all kind of wickedness the bible said the prayer of the righteous avail is much are you with me and he said if my people they were to call by my name will humble themselves people got so much pride that they can invoke god and call him on the scene and god i know god is living like the devil amen and like these the god's boss amen can't you see the god of this evil age has got people so blind he said if our gospel be healed it's here to them that are what whom the god of this world has what blinded the mind of them that believe not least the light of the glory's gospel of christ who is the image of god shall shine unto them amen are you with me amen god amen light ain't shining because they ain't praise god this is the deceiving age people can live any kind of way and do any kind of thing and think it's all right to do why because satan has worked his work in deception and given them as the prophet of god said in this age he's giving them a strong delusion amen they actually amen the devil is set in the temple of god showing himself that he is god and people will worship him as god they would believe a lie because they learned not to love of the truth so god would give them a strong illusion that they should believe the law that they might be there who believe not the truth amen praise god if they would only believe that oh god amen you can't do god any kind of way and get to heaven you can't live any kind of way and go to church and change preaching amen and do all this stuff and think you're gonna go to heaven anyhow brother and sister i believe amen praise god at the righteous scarcely [Music] i said if the righteous scarcely amen we say where shall the sinner and the ungodly amen amen praise god if we just scarcely get in amen are you with me if god didn't shorten the days for the election amen then what about all these people just doing any kind of thing any kind of way and live in any kind of way brother and sister i want you to know god's gonna require that your hand one day amen amen god gone you're gonna have to give an answer amen for what you the life you live and the thing you've done in your body you're gonna have to give an answer to god one day god's gonna require it at your hand they make god gonna say to you as you told the rich man today thy soul is required of you amen god don't bring you into judgment you're going to have to give a count for the deeds that are done in the body you're going to have to amen i i said i'd rather they may come to god now amen praise god and let god save me and for oh hallelujah amen hallelujah it's better to come on to jesus right now while you the blood is running warm in your veins while you have that opportunity god [Music] that looked like every thursday i'd go down to mullins and and i down there last thursday i think a 17 year old young man that got killed brother marshall come he says but salmon they're shooting up people not here it is it's 17 year old young fella got killed and then the next time and a family that was coming to church and he said he said somebody just got shot in the head and i said oh goodness i think i baptized your mom and most of that family and he said get shot got shot in the head and he's in charleston ain't expecting he wasn't naked he died and i said young man and i said lord look at this every week some some young person is getting murdered killed are you with me and young people just going to keep going ain't going to stop nothing they if they sinning they're going to keep on sinning if they lying they're going to get whatever they doing they just saying they ain't worrying about a thing you know if it meant for me to go to hell i'm going that's the way that's the attitude it meant for me to go to hell i'm going i'm going to tell you something you're going to be sad sad sad if you end up in hell you ain't going to have nothing well i didn't mean it no you meant it you're a minute you made your decision you did you had a free will and you could have willed to please god amen and knowing that god would have the best life amen god had a better life praise god god had everything prepared for you but you didn't want it praise god god had a good family and god had a good home god had a good god had everything laid out before you but you chose to go your own way man are you with me [Music] he said look what i i could have should have but you chose the wrong direction amen amen are you with me well god intended that he knew that from the beginning that's okay fine fine but i'm gonna tell you you won't be without excuse i believe that god gave you that opportunity to make the right decision but you chose to make make the wrong decision he told cain if you do right do like your brother instead of doing like his brother he wouldn't kill his brother are you with me i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister oh let's go let's go let's go i got i got to finish i won't finish but i get somewhere going down the road but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes you know i thought about the brother the pastor that came to me and you know we just discussed certain things about the word that god descended inside well nonsense but he said if he he would just avoid unlearned foolish questions see what i'm saying when people come to you telling you hey hey this message ain't right and this ain't that i mean if you can avoid that stuff what what's the purpose of it what are they trying to convince you of uh private he just fought come on praise god what about them who who gave you the ability to judge are you with me amen you know sometimes folk the pastor this and sister brother that of all that stuff that don't mean nothing avoid it well loving brother sons you know i thought about look read that again but foolish and what unlearned unlearned questions what avoid avoid it's a lot of things we can avoid that don't mean nothing to us sometimes what's going on in somebody else's house ain't got nothing to do with what's going on in yours amen what's going on in somebody else's church ain't got nothing to do with what's going on in here amen amen are you with me what's going on on that internet ain't got nothing to go what's going on here oh you haven't been amen well they said this they said i'm going to get just be news reporters who you report to because we ain't got time to hear that i'm trying to work out my own soul salvation with fear and trembling i'm trying to get to helping you i have all that gossip and all that stuff going on out there facebook twitter and this and that instagram and all of that lord have mercy i'm going to tell you something i might get ahead of my story but you know the devil he wants to keep you occupied and keep you busy because if you ever settle down and get some time to pray and to seek the will of god for your life amen but the devil alone he can keep you occupied keep you busy on things that don't mean nothing anyway things ain't gonna help you and ain't gonna edify ain't gonna profit nothing amen but he keep you busy and occupied oh you know so and so on you know there are things i know hey look listen up look down um lord have mercy amen the devil will keep you occupied and busy that you are not looking at with your needs and the needs of your family he keeps you occupied and other folk church until you can help the local church the one that you come to build up and help you can't be a help you can't be an instrument and you can't be an encourager because it keeps you discouraged and all other stuff amen but you need to be lifting people up and encouraging people and witnessing because people are lost and people need god and they need help amen so you need to be that one amen on your knees crying out god helped so and so god bless sister brother god keep us so god god will keep my family amen amen but instead of the devil keep you busy he said visit by busybody and other men's matters amen the devil keeps you busy and other people matters are you with me so i'm saying the god of this evil age he's got his tactics of deception the things that he worked and the things that he do he'll keep you busy that you won't be a help and a blessing to others amen see that's what the devil won't even why you can be encouraging and blessing and strengthening other people the devil have you so busy and so uh occupied to you hey hey what no no just skip around me leave me alone i want to pray amen i want to you know i want to be a blessing i want to be able to look and see and discern and say god amen so and so and i need to stand in the gap i need to pray because they're being a victim of the enemy [Music] amen so he says uh avoid amen these uh foolish and unlearned questions knowing that they do what anything that's going to gender strife avoid it amen amen because you know it ain't profitable it's going to gender what avoid it god told me use it for luck and avoid think if it's going to gender strife then i know i need to avoid it amen amen amen so john 24 and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men see you see what i'm saying it must not strive but be what gentle and i said lord brother nathan call me nothing nice here it was a trap set for me you know he said like he said like evil spirit got on saul on him to be jealous of david that evil spirit got on saul that made him jealous that david tried to kill that he said he said i i watch him he said i know you got to walk in love amen don't get a jealous spirit on you amen he said you know i said you got to be careful cause i need that jealousy spirit to get on you and you have oh oh yes but i said thank the lord amen and i know what he was talking about i said you see that what i said i said we we're in the age of maturity we're walking in perfect love now i said don't matter what people do we're trying to help them amen brother and sister that's what we're trying to help folk we're trying to worry about all those you know whatever they whatever god bless you with thank god for the blessing whatever god do in your life thank god for it amen we ain't got time to worry about you know what god what god has given us we're grateful and thankful for but to be jealous of other folk you know you can get a little you get a little spirit on you sometimes but you got to be guard yourself amen that it does not that you that you lose your gentleness in your kindness when you can't be gentle and kind anymore you lost it amen why because amen in the proceeding you didn't avoid certain things because so you lost your gentleness and your kindness amen the sweetness of god that comes from the holy ghost that sweet loving spirit amen instead of instead of you having that sweet all that mental spirit that rests on a believer and that love of god that you can embrace and you can go freely before the throne of grace and find help in the time of need amen that free spirit will you love jesus where you want everybody to know the love of god well you want everybody to have the peace of god when you end up you're in a place in a state of maturity but when you see a person don't have it amen when you see individuals that don't have that peace and that love amen don't have the peace that you have don't have that love and they are not experiencing the sweetness of the spirit that spirit is so sweet and so kind and so loving easy to be embraced amen amen amen but be gentle until what oh man just those that love you until what oh man not not just to the people in the church a saved person or not anybody oh man be gentle to all men oh i ain't no i don't know about that you're gentle gentle just just nice nice and kind gentle to all men app to what teach what i have to teach what patient y'all know how much patience we have with one another yeah you know how do you know a person don't have patience because they got a temple they get mad easy are you with me see a patient with a person with patient is not going to get angry easy yeah they got patient and your patient possess you your what soul amen i would say tribulation work is what patient and patient what experience experience hope and hope makers as well because of the what little love of god is and brought in our hearts because of the love of god shed abroad in our hearts we can have patience amen are you with me because the patience is the attribute of the spirit of god amen amen and because that's an attribute amen praise god of the spirit of god so i love amen the holy ghost amen comes the virtues are you with me so the holy ghost amen has a a a a a personality amen amen amen and and has a character amen amen because the holy ghost is a person and a person of jesus christ is manifested by his own characteristics are you look man so you you see the nature of god the divine nature of god amen exemplified amen in the christian walk and god amen knows what he wants to do with the word in this hour and we know what god is doing in this hour what he's expecting of you and i and he's expecting us to walk in the statue of a perfect man to come into maturity amen amen but in coming into maturity we're going to be tried and tested it says this is why i want to conclude in in in a sense because this is i says lord you know going back over god of this evil age and thinking it's a lot of true powerful things there but this is where i want to focus just a little bit because sometimes you're doing and you're not understanding what you're doing and why you're doing what you're doing and so lately because i said because i was about 70 years old and forget about all the craziness and what people say thing i said ain't got time for it don't mean nothing anyway you know what i said but it's not only that god is showing me something it's not it's it's a it's a level of maturity you know what i'm saying the things that bothered you when you was 10 and 13 and 25 and 40 and 50 when you get 60 you know still when you get 70 you say man i'm about ready to go home i'm ready to go with the lord all that stuff don't matter you got a level maturity you want to sit back and relax and go on to heaven sister because your brother friend let's go to heaven man you know grandchildren to come children thank the lord for y'all but i'm going on to heaven but it's time to go to heaven relax son brother and sister it's time that we amen i know you're not in 60 or 70 but it's time to relax and come on get matured let's go to heaven are you with me because you know it's better that you learn you don't have to wait till you get old to learn that all the blessings of god is available for you as a young person you don't have to wait till you get six to seven we're telling you the blessings are here god want to do great things for you amen hallelujah don't let everybody be blessed around you and you set back yeah i i i think i i love renting the house why are you gonna rent the house and god want to give you a house i'm talking about god want to give you you know i hadn't seen the person yet that come in the church be faithful faith tithes and offering and god didn't bless them abundantly amen this is over 45 years of pastor and i hadn't seen that amen my old bishop used to tell me he said you pay your tithes in the offering and be faithful to god and god will bless you amen amen amen i used to hear bishop washington say that all the time you know you be faithful to god god will bless you are you with me and it's proven to be true amen the people that faithful to god and put god first god blesses them all kind of ways that don't matter i mean they bless them all in coming in and going out all they gotta do is be faithful to god you see the you'll see sometimes it looks like it ain't coming but it comes [Music] amen praise god just it might take a little time sometime and take a little longer than others but god blesses his children and faithful to him [Music] amen so here we are this is the part i want to close in and i i took too long to get here but uh and i probably aren't going to avoid a whole lot um okay 25 read in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god pre-adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth see some people oppose themselves i said it's two opposing spirits the devil and god and sometimes see paul instructing timothy it's some folk that you're going to have to be patient with because they oppose their own self amen but he says here uh that god prevents you will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth so he says i want you to be apt to teach i have patient teach patient and meekness and meekness see sometimes we want to tell people you are not to be doing that i you know god continue to hell for doing that he said you see that oh you know no no no no no in meekness see that's the part we miss you it's all right for you to tell them not to do it in meekness you got to be gentle because they don't know that they are succumbed that they overcome with the spirit they don't know not all people if they only knew the power of the spirit that got control over them you know sometimes a people a woman a man might dress a certain way not knowing that it's temptation and not knowing that it's presenting a a filthy and unclean spirit and i think the prophet god called it a prostitute and spirit sometimes they don't know that the spirit inside of them is a prostitute and spirit that they're showing the um you know things that they should not show are you with me sometimes they don't know that inside of them is a prostituting spirit though they might not never commit to act in a sense but when men look on them the men commit adultery amen amen are you with me now it all not to be said but sometimes you have to tell people because people are unconscious of what they're doing sometimes amen but them being ignorant of that you can't ah but you know and then meekness instructing those that oppose what they opposed themselves they uh actually now look what it says in the next verse 26 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him see they are taking what they are taking captive see and they not they not they don't know they are taken captive why because the spirit of deception the devil has deceived him that they are all right i'm saved i'm sanctified i'm holy ghost filled and i'm five baptized and i go on my way to heaven see what i'm saying when the bible says a woman should not wear that which pertaining to a man for all that do so is abomination in the sight of god so a woman when she put on a pair of pants she don't think are you doing nothing wrong these are ladies or when they wear you know certain things they they don't feel condemned at all why you know it's a lack of teaching preaching in the pulpit they're telling the people it's all right but we gotta in meekness instructing those that amen amen oppose themselves amen you got to be gentle with folk because folk don't know that a spirit instructed those that oppose themselves so by the grace of god people oppose their own self and it came to me really strong that you have to be careful when a person is the victim of a cat in captivity by a spirit and you are actually looking down or trying to treat the person with the wrong kind of attitude and a person is taken captive by a spirit that they don't even know the bible says with meekness you got to instruct them that oppose their own self see they don't they don't know and a lot of spirits can get on people and they can conduct their lives in such a way that you have to be patient with them amen and if you're not patient with them then you can call you know things that happen in their lives that would not have happened if you were only been patient but because of lack of patience a person that is taken captive by our evil spirit some people are taken captive sometimes by a gossiping spirit a lying spirit and sometimes you have to just be patient with if you go straight at that spirit that spirit will tell you you lying you know what i'm saying sometimes you have to let things work out like time and patience with foe loving them that oppose their own self amen they don't understand that the spirit doesn't got in here now if david would have handled saul like saul was handling david then david would have killed saul but david had a lot of patience why because god amen had given david word amen i i know what the word said i can't touch god's anointing amen i don't care what he does to me i cannot touch him because he's god's anointed are you a man so david amen had you know and and i thank god for people like joseph and david and different experiences that god has given given us in the bible and people like stephen that was being stoned to death by him by saul and in in that crowd and he said forgive him see i thank god that it comes a time amen praise god when amen when folk are actually throwing stones at you and you have enough grace in your heart to understand that damn it's not them it's a spirit that's got them doing this are you a man and so what happens amen god even had mercy on you and i because it was a spirit that had control over our lives amen we were possessed by devils and demons amen that had us in bondage but god came jesus came and died for us amen he went to the cross and he gave himself for us brother and sister he could have amen said amen he could have said something like some folk that was devils but he didn't look at us as devils he looked at us with love amen and he said it's the long suffering of god that calls us to repentance amen i'm so glad that god gave us space to repent god allowed us to repent of our sins and accept jesus christ i'm glad that he gave us amen grace in this hour are you with me see because what happens amen things that we are experiencing god is saying to timothy i i i'm charging you i'm i'm required of you to know how to handle situations so of those that amen praise god oppose their own soul amen i'm trying to help you to pull some out of the fire praise god because they amen they're headed to the fire but you'll be able to pull some from the fire oh you would have been and i i'm saying to you amen be patient with one another be patient with your brother be patient with your sister be patient with those amen that you feel like amen are in arrow be patient with them are you with me amen they might be going through a little something pray for them be patient to if if you have enough meekness and gentleness to go to him and say brother and sister i want you to make it in the kingdom come on and go to heaven with me i love you brother i love your sister sometimes you're the one that ain't maybe able to pull somebody out the fire you're the one to show that love and that reaching out amen your hands are mercy and understanding they meant that you were in sin one day somebody reached out to you and somebody cared enough about you to tell you the truth amen where would you be if god didn't love you if god didn't care about your walk i'm here to let you go on amen praise god brother and sister i'm so glad who's in control amen the spirit amen that now working in the children of disobedient praise god let us not be disobedient children but let us be obedient because we can eat the fat of the land god got a lot of things in store for them that love him and god wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed if you only allow jesus christ to be in control of your life but we know the devil is prince in the power there the god of this evil age he's deceived it the whole world if he can but you ought to be one of those sins praise god i chose not to be deceived i'm making my decision i want to live for god i want god to be the head of my life i want him to be in leadership i want him to rule i want god to be in control brother and sister if i tell you the truth amen just say lord help me to do it if i tell you the truth say lord it's the word amen and god give me grace to do it because i want to make it how about you brother and sister i want you to make it if if i didn't want you to make it i wouldn't even tell you but because we love you we tell you the truth god bless you let us there where would i be if jesus didn't care where would i be if jesus hadn't sacrificed his life for me oh but i'm glad so glad he did let us by his father in the name of jesus christ in a world so full of darkness lord it comes a time when the bible said you should know the truth and the truth shall make you free the world don't care but you care lord somebody says that's a an outdated gospel

children somebody got to stand in the gap and make up their heads it's not with words that we can talk because they're not listening but prayer can reach way your words that you speak to them is not

here it as he was just preaching it it made me just think about when i used to work in the prisons and and i used to hear some of the inmates some of that the reason why they end up in the prisons and i had one of those one the prisoners told me he said that all my life he was about 40 years old he said my whole life nobody told me that they loved me he said and it's not an excuse for some of the crimes that he did but it shows for how we have to have sympathy for different people for people we don't know people's situations amen so those different prisoners they would come to me with their stories and they would tell me and really it was compassion and that was the only way really that i was able to survive and really to be able to work in a prison like that amen just having compassion
