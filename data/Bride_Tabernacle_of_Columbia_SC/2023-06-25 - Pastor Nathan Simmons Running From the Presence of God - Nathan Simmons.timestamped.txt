[39:15] Amen in the Book of Jonah
[39:21] and I know what
[39:23] about running from my subject is this
[39:26] morning is a man running from the
[39:29] presence of God
[39:32] also my subtop it is in his presence
[39:38] if you hear this morning
[39:42] and maybe you say brother Nathan I'm
[39:46] running from God
[39:50] were they a God that know how to catch
[39:53] you
[39:54] amen you're only the first chapter
[39:57] when I read the first verse you may be
[39:59] seated
[40:02] not a word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[40:05] the son of MI
[40:07] saying you may be said
[40:11] arises go to ninevee that great City
[40:16] and cry against it
[40:19] for their wickedness
[40:22] is come up before me
[40:25] but Jonah
[40:27] rolls up to flee unto Tasha
[40:31] from the present of the lord and he went
[40:34] down to Joplin
[40:37] and he found a ship going to tashu
[40:42] so he paid the fair there and went down
[40:46] into it
[40:48] to go with them unto Joshua from the
[40:52] president of the Lord
[40:57] but the Lord now I'm telling God got
[40:59] away again you ain't here
[41:01] but the Lord sent a great win
[41:05] into the sea
[41:07] and there was a mighty temperance in the
[41:11] scene
[41:12] so that his ship was like
[41:15] to be broken
[41:17] then the marinas
[41:19] were praised
[41:22] and cried every man
[41:24] unto his God
[41:27] and he cast both walls and there was in
[41:30] the ship
[41:31] and into the scene
[41:33] to light inn of them
[41:36] but Jonah was gone down into the ship
[41:42] in the side of the ship
[41:45] and lay
[41:47] and was fast asleep
[41:50] so the shipmaster came to him
[41:53] and said it to him
[41:55] wasn't thy
[41:58] old sleeper
[42:00] arise called upon thy God
[42:04] is so be that God
[42:06] will thank upon us
[42:09] that we
[42:11] perish not
[42:13] and they said unto everyone and just
[42:17] fellow come let us cast Law
[42:21] that we made known
[42:24] for whom
[42:25] caused the evil come upon us
[42:29] so they cast a lot
[42:32] in the lockpel upon Jonah
[42:35] and they said
[42:37] unto him
[42:38] tell us we pray thee who calls this evil
[42:44] upon us
[42:45] and what is the occupation
[42:49] and went cometh thou
[42:53] and what is the country
