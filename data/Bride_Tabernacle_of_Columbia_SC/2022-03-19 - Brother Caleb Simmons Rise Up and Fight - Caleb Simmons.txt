name we pray amen [Music] amen god is good amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen let us turn to the book of judges chapter seven when you got it say man i'll wait for a few more all right judges chapter 7 and verse 1 and it reads then derubable who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well herod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of mora in the valley and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midian knights into that their hands these israel want themselves against me saying my own hand has saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from the from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down into the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people into the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that left it of the water with his tongue as a dog lapith him shalt thou set by himself likewise everyone that bow with down upon his knee to drink and the number of them that left putting his hand on their to their mouths were 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water and the lord said unto gideon by 300 men that left will i save you and deliver the midian knights into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people took victorias in their hands and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man into his tent and retained those 300 men and the host of the midian was beneath him in the valley god bless the reading of this word you may be seated i'm going to read down a little bit further here in the scripture and it says and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get deep down unto the host for i have delivered it into the into thine hand but if thou fit if thou feared to go down go thou with fear fura thy servant down to the host and thou shall hear what they say and afterwards shalt nine hands be strengthened to go down into the host then went he down into with fury his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host and the midianites and the malachites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitudes and their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for mo for multitude and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lord caico barley tumbled into the holster midian and came into a tent and smoted that it fell and overturned it in that tent lay along and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else say the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel but into his hands as god deliver midian and all the hosts and it was so when gideon heard telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian amen amen i'd like to take a little topic this evening of rise up and fight rise up and fight in this story if you read before israel was in a hard time israel enemies they was coming in the chapter before israel enemies was coming every time at harvest time and taken everything that they had planted and harvested the children of israelites had planted and harvested all the many crops and all the fields to the point that they was having to hide the food they was having to hide the blessings that god had given them from the enemy because the enemy was coming in like a flood and at one point in time god came and he said it's time for deliverance it's time for deliverance and it's time for for the israelites to be victorious over their enemies it's time for them to have victory so so he came and he spoke to gideon and he said and he and gideon said the angel of the lord came to him and he spoke to him and said gideon i'm going to use you to lead your people into victory and gideon said he said he said if god be with us then where be where is all the miracles if god be with us the god that brought us from the land of egypt across the the red sea and into the land that we're in if he be with us then where be all his miracles and it was time for the israelites to rise up and fight it was time for them to get some gumption about themselves and realize that the battle was the lord's not theirs it wasn't something that they was fighting it was god's battle all they had to do was stand up and be ready to be to fight that's all they had to do and so gideon was like well i'm not sure so he tested him he put the lord through a series of tests that you can read but here in this story the lord wanted to show him a sign that he had victory that victory was his so he took him down to the camp and he said go down there and god sent the enemy a vision that gideon was going to destroy them the enemy already knew what was going to happen before it happened and god was just confirming to gideon that i'm already with you all you have to do is rise up and fight cause the battle is yours it's not yours but it's the lords and he has given you the victory and in this gideon he got his men together he said y'all can in verse 15 it says arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the the holster media gideon was no longer worried was he gonna win this battle gideon was no longer worried was his enemy going to defeat him because he had signed after a sign that showed him that god was on his side god had given him this victory all he had to do was stand rise up and fight he had to go out there and march he had to do something he couldn't just sit home he had to do something to show forth lord i am with you and he said i wrote down something that said don't lay down and take it rise up and fight many of times we get to a certain situation where gideon had got to the point i'm just going to hide this food and hopefully it won't get stolen i'm just going to sit back and try to make him make this me what it able what what i'm able to meet here but god wanted him to rise up and fight so that he can get all the blessings that god was giving him not just a portion where he was going to hide it from people and and have to be by the wine press with his portion and hopefully and make it through and it won't get noticed god wanted to give him so much more but he had to rise up and fight and believe that victory was his he had to believe that victory was for him and then and that's what it says here and the scripture says in in romans 8 and romans 8 i'll read the scripture roman romans 8 and 28 it's a very familiar scripture romans 8 and 28 and when you got to say amen and it reads and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for him he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first one among among many and i'll go down to the 34 first verse he said what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us and and it takes it says if god before you who can be against you so you don't have to fear being able to rise and up and fight in your enemy you don't have to be afraid that your enemy is going to defeat you because of god before you who can be against you there's nothing that can stand in your way if god is on your side you turn to somebody and say i am victorious turn around to somebody else because they might not have believed you and say i am victorious and that's what you got to understand that you are victorious in jesus christ because god is with you yes there's nothing that can stand in your way when god is with you so you just got to stand up and fight you're not going to defeat the devil by laying down and taking what he gives you you're not going to defeat the devil by just sitting on the wayside and sitting and wallowing in depression you're not gonna defeat the devil if you continue to take his anxiety with you you're not gonna defeat him if you just sit by and allow the devil to beat you up but at some point in time you gotta get sick and tired of being defeated by the devil and believe that lord i'm going to take you by the word that you gave me and i'm going to fight i'm going to rise up and i'm going to fight because i am victorious that's not a maybe that's not a might be god you already undefeated the devil at calvary so i don't have to worry about that the devil is going to defeat me i am victorious that's something that i have to repeat every single day because the devil is going to continue to fight you every single day then i wrote down something self if you give god more he will keep you the more you give god the more he will keep you the more you give him all of your life the more he is able to keep you god can keep you from everything that you may go through in life and just knowing that whatever if god before you who can be against you your path is laid before you and understanding that this battle is not yours you're trying to fight it with things and trying to do this and do that and all you got to do is go down on your knees and get closer to god that's all you got to do every single day is lord i need your help because i'm not going to make it i won't make it all by myself if it's not for you that's leading me and guiding me each and every day lord jesus if it's not you standing by my side each and every day then i won't make it there was a song that i heard the other day and it said down on my knees when troubles rise i'll talk with jesus beyond the sky said he promised me that he would hear my plea and i would tell him down on my knees and it was something that ran wrong in my heart and said lord i got to get closer and go down on my knees i got to go down because lord you promised that you would hear my plea if i go down on my seat and i will tell them all about it down on my knees that lord that you are my strength you are my provider you are my healer you are my keeper when i'm in trouble lord you're able to deliver me because lord you can do everything that i need each and every day of my life lord i need you even more every day and some came to me and said you got to fight you got to fight for what you believe in we look at the people over there in ukraine they thought it was going to be an easy battle but they never considered that someone was going to fight for their homeland someone was going to fight for what they believed in it wasn't nothing that could tear you away from what what you believe in if you believe that god has given you the victory then you will never stop fighting if you believe that god has given you everything that you need then you'll never stop fighting even if the devil knocks you down if the devil beats you in a battle that don't mean he won the war just because he won one battle don't mean that he won the war with you and god can deliver you up out of everything that you go through it's just understanding that i gotta rise up and i gotta fight i gotta take up my my sword and my shield of faith and my helmet of salvation my sword that is the word of god and i got to fight the only way to to defeat the devil is with the word of god so i got to know what the word of god is to defeat the devil if you don't know it then you can't defeat him so you got to study you got to pray and you got to know god for yourself in order to understand that lord if you before me then who can be against me all i got to do is rise up and fight so it takes some action to in order to get some reactions and if you want to see the devil run you got to you got to do something otherwise the devil is going to sit back there and he don't have to fight you he don't have to move because you ain't doing nothing to move him you ain't doing nothing to say well i don't want you you sitting over there and say lord well devil you can sit there stay comfortable let me go get you a blanket you can lay down and take your time and i'll just deal with this for the rest of my life i can i i think i can take this for the rest of my life when god want to give you complete victory he wanted to give you he wanted the devil to not even be in your neighborhood not even be in your vicinity but you you laid a nice good place and the devil said i'll take my oh thank you thank you let me sit down and rest a little while when what you want is to rise up and fight him and say you can't stay here you can't live here this is not your home this is not the place that you need to be comfortable if anything i don't want you around even in my vicinity lord i want to stand up and rise up and fight lord i want to use your word to defeat every demon that's coming against me and every devil that may come to harm me i want to rise up and fight there's so much excuse me there's so much that that was coming and said jesus has already won the battle so you don't have to worry about being victorious you don't have to worry that you won't make it that you want that you won't defeat this devil because jesus has already won that battle he's already won and he won it back at calvary when he died for your sins everything he knew what you was going to do before you even got here he knew where you was going to be before you ever got here and he knew that he could save you from whatever you was going through he knew that he went there and he died and he said you was worth saving you was worth me dying on the cross taking those whips taking those lashes you were worth it if if you don't believe it all you got to do is say lord i am worth it he might not have done it for nobody else but he did it for me and i can rest on that i can stand assured that lord you did it for me and if he can do it for me i know he can do it for you because if god before you who can be against you and understanding that you can't lay down and take it you got to rise up and fight it's too late in the hour and too late in the evening where you can just sitting back and relaxing just understanding that we we got to understand that we can rise up and fight we can we can rise up and fight because god has already given us to victory the devil only wants to distract you and hinder you from believing that you have the victory the devil cannot not say that you don't have the victory he can only make you doubt that you have the victory he can only make you doubt that god won't do what he said he will do he could only make you doubt that god is not a healer so that you stay sick he can only make you doubt that god isn't a provider so that you continue to be dependent god can only make you the devil can only make you doubt that but god has said i will supply all your needs so if god gave you a need he said i'll be the supplier of it if god get if god gave you these things he if he gave you a sickness then he said that i will be the healer if he gave if he gave you many different trials and tribulations god said i can deliver you out of the mall and just understanding that we have to rise up and fight we have to rise up and i wanted to read something that i had down here amen and it says and how they would had done the israelites the philistines and the midianites the amorites and all the different ones that come in like locusts and just eat up what they had and take it out and go on but did you notice they cannot do that until the israelites first fell away from god the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until first you get away from god you must first remember that check when anything happens see if you are in the faith or not see that you're right up to the place with god then remember the devil can do you no harm you're in christ when you are in christ the devil cannot bother you he cannot hinder you he cannot stop you from getting what god has given you but it's somewhere along the line you have to check your life and say am i in the faith am i in the faith am i am i doing what god has ordained for me to do it it says but time has come for action and that's the same now the time has come for action the time had come when playing church had come to a halt with god there was no there was more playing there was no more playing church we must get down to business i trust that's the same that god will place this upon the hearts of the people tonight that it's time to help playing church playing religion playing righteousness now it's time for action now it's time for us to rise up and fight now it's time to fight for the ones that can't fight for themselves now it's time to stand in the gap for the ones that can't stand in the gap for themselves that may be gone too far but if you believe you can turn to somebody and say i am victorious you can turn to somebody and say lord they are victorious because i believe that you said in your word that you would that you would deliver them out of everything that they going through so i'm going to stand in the gap and believe for them even though they may not believe for themselves but i believe for them until one day the light bulb may come on and when it comes on i don't have to worry about a thing because they realize that god who if god is for them who can be against them if god is for them he can deliver them out of them out of everything that they're going through so i so you got to understand that maybe you fighting for somebody else you may be uplifting and by your fight you showing for us what god can do for somebody else they may not be following what you're doing but they're watching they may not be saying that i i'm gonna follow that path but they watching your path they're looking to see what you're going to do when your battle hits you they're looking to see how you're going to react when the devil fights you how are you going to react to this situation and they're like let's see if he in the faith or not because you profess to be a christian but let me see if your life lines up with what you what you say let me see if if you truly believe what you speak about when you got that headache do you believe that god can deliver you from that headache or are you right there popping pills with everybody else that's when you understand that god has the ability to to give you everything that you stand in need of when you understand that god has the ability that he has already defeated everything that you will face then you then you walk with a new authority you walk with a new joy you walk with a new step because you understand that god has given me everything the bible says that every every every place that your foot of your soul tread on god has given unto you when you understand that every place that he's that you walk on god gave it to you and it's yours you don't have to question whether it's yours or not you know it's yours when you go to your house and you don't bought your house you ain't wondering how to get in the door you're going right there put the key in there and you're opening the door because why is yours you ain't got to worry about somebody else being there because it's yours and when something is yours you have ownership over it you have ownership that this is mine i can take it when i want if it's your car i can go wherever i want in it i can stop wherever i want i can eat in it i can drink it i can do whatever i want because it's mine and you got to understand that's the way your situations are if god has given you the victory then it's your victory you don't have to wait on it in the wait to come you can speak the word over your situation and say that i am victorious i yeah victoria i may not see the victory happening right now but i am victorious and i will rest on that and hold on to it that god i am victorious no matter what situation i'm going through i am victorious i'm not waiting on victory to happen i am victorious and i can speak the word and rest assured that it's going to happen it may not happen today it may not happen tomorrow brother branham he spoke about the story of the man that got that was blind and he went up in the prayer line and brother branham prayed for him and he and he said and and came back in the prayer line again and he said i can't see yet and brother branham said did you believe he said yes he said well then go on if you believe then you shall receive your sight well he kept going on and he left the meeting and he went back and he was he was on the street selling newspapers i believe the story says and he and he and everyone he told when everybody when everybody met him he said i can see he said i can see he couldn't see but he said i can see because he believed that he could see and one day he got in the barber chair and then the barber was sitting there and he said he said what you say you can see he said i can see the barber was about to laugh at him and then all of a sudden he said i can see and his eyes popped open he went running out that barber chair because one day what he confessed became reality what he was confessing became reality that's why words are so important in the way that you use them the way that you use them each and every day if you if you speak negative things then you never get better you'll never have positive things happening to you but you got to speak the word you got to speak things like i am victorious no matter if i'm down and now i am victorious because god has brought me through and i he will continue to bring me through amen [Applause] rise up and fight amen y'all appreciate the word tonight i thank the lord for that you know i've been looking at uh this last week in the half going over david and and you know he's saying rise up and fight i said david rose up and fought didn't he you know as a little boy saying the thing is that you know what when goliath was out there that situation and saul and all his men was out there trembling david came in but he had testimonies to solve what faith in god would do and i was thinking about how i said that little boy when you saw that lion and that bear the bible says david told him i got the lamb from him and he when he rose up against me i caught him by the beard i said how close he had to be to that animal to catch him by the beard and he said i slew him but i said what it is showing you what faith in god will do not only that it says when he went out to goliath and he told goliath he said you coming to me with word with sword and spirits he said but i'm coming into to you in the name of the lord of hosts and i said you know it's something about we know that name come on and it's power in that name ain't it it's a difference of how you come how many believe that well i said i like how i was thinking about when caleb brother caleb was speaking tonight to rise up and fight he says like he said the god already fought the battle for you and i thought about how david told goliath he says that the battle the battle is the lord's and he says and after this day the whole earth gonna know that there's a god in israel and i thought about that i said i looked at our situation today and you know we're looking here now to take a rapture but what it is we fighting in the goliath and david and goliath type situations in our lives ain't we but what it is what will faith in god do i was sharing with my son moses the other day i said you know was talking and how everybody's saying you know we on the break of world war three and i says that you know you got to know god for yourself i says that you know you got to get the holy ghost for yourself and i said that we started we started going over the holy ghost and all and it says what it is you know the bible says to repent that's the first thing a lot of people don't even believe they need repentance today some in the church don't believe they don't see the need for it the prophet of god says but when you don't see the need for it then you're in worse shape than the people out in the street at least the man out in the street know what kind of shape he in come on do you believe that what i say is that you you got to repent and the bible says be baptized in the name of the lord jesus for remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's not nothing hard but it's a what it's a promise that god gave you how do you receive the holy ghost by doing what god said and believing on the promise that he gave you and the thing is the devil put all kind of things in your mind you can't let the devil do that to you why because you living by a promise that god gave so when you raise your hands when you when you raise your hands you praising god you say lord thank you for the promise because god made you a promise and ain't no devil in hell that can stop that promise from coming to pass because almighty god spoke his word and they can't return back to them void hallelujah and i said that that's what it is i said what are we living by today a promise that god made why ain't your heart fearing like the rest of the world because of promises that god made come on that heaven and earth to pass away but his word won't pass away that i'm engraved in the palm of his hand and nobody can't take him out that even though he's the world i might die this body might be lost but i know that my soul is in god's hand and he said i'm going away to prepare a place for you that where i am you might be also why you so happy on the mister break of world war iii because of a promise that god made me and i know that god is going to keep his promise i'm still shouting i'm still dancing i'm still praising god in the midst of the break of world war three because of a promise that god made me you know i thought about this week preaching on the seed of abraham come on and how god promised abraham he was gonna bless his seed didn't he he said in blessing i'ma bless you and multiply multiply thy seed he said and they'll possess the gates of the enemy god is gonna fight against those that fought against them he gave abraham a promise didn't he now we look at that even the scripture says that didn't just go to the natural seed but to those that are the spiritual household of faith to all that can believe so i said that those promises those are your promises what are you fearing about tonight what are you lacking tonight let's say it like that because god has gave you a promise how are you gonna make this journey through by the promises of god come on they shall overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their what testimony what are we testifying about that god is keeping his promises god is still saving god is still healing he's still delivering come on in your situation i was telling my wife yesterday was talking about a situation i said you got to have faith in god sometime come on you got to turn your faith loose as the pastor was preaching and see what god would do sometime come on how many believe that tonight i'm stirred amen i just i said thank the lord you know i was thanking the lord for brother caleb tonight and you know for just pouring out his heart it's something to encourage us i believe that we need encouraging in this hour because of what's going on if you listen to the news and everything around it to do what bog you down in depression won't it but we need encouragement to let us know that hey when we see these things we need to rejoice jesus was talking to the people in his in in the days when he was walking the earth back in the flesh and he was telling them that then when they asked him what shall be the the the end and the sign of that coming all these things and he began to tell them about the wars the rumors of wars pestilence diverse places and all these things going on but then he began to tell him but i don't want you to fear i don't want you to be afraid he said because that world it's going to be evil but he said i i cut short the time for the elect's sake come on and i believe that if he cut short time for the elect's sake then he's going to take care of his elect the bombs might fall but god going to take care of his elect i don't know about you but i says i'm looking for my future home i'm looking for that place across the river come on because the longer we live in this life you born of a few days and ain't do but full of what nothing but what trouble come on live long enough you start seeing trouble on every side but i'm looking to go to a place to where there ain't no trouble where there ain't no pain there ain't no sickness come on there ain't no doubts and fears but there's righteousness and joy the sunshine is shining every day the sun is shining every day that's what i'm looking to go to that place i don't know about you but i'm stirred you said have you given up on this life come on i gave up on this life long time ago when i gave it over to jesus because now i'm not living this life for myself but i'm living this life so i can live again i let go and let god lord use me i was listening to that song on the way coming to church tonight lord let your word be born in the manger of my heart i don't know about you but something got to be born in your hearts that's what it is you can't live this life on your own you can't make it on your own something got to be born in your heart you got to let god come in there and straighten it out hallelujah and live his life through you let his power resonate in you that you can get up off your deeds and know that all things are possible to them that believe when you're in a situation it'll turn around for you why because you met almighty god and that's what we want to do tonight you got to meet god come on face to face you got to know what his power is like like brother's saying tonight it's time out for playing church singing and just going home preaching and just going home it's time for the power it's time for them that know that god to do exploits of faith hallelujah it's time to rise up and fight go out meet the enemy hallelujah the god of the preachers my god too hallelujah the god of the saints of all is my god too come on he's the same yesterday today and forever he ain't lost his power devil get away from me get away from my home get away from my body because my god is real and today the whole world gonna know hallelujah there's still a god in colombia come on hallelujah oh jesus that's still a god hallelujah a living god we ain't preaching to you no pain of fire but real fight that only comes from god oh jesus how many believe that tonight i said do you feel like worshiping god do you feel like rising up and fighting come on oh jesus come on don't let the devil boo you come on rise up and fight i thank the lord tonight amen do you thank the lord i don't know about you but i just feel like i've been rebirthed all over again come on it's feel like something just stirred you all over again i was thinking i said lord as i was singing that song let your word be born in the manger of my heart look like god taking you back to that place to where you first believe back to that place where you first was illuminated something got a hold to you you say why would god do that i believe because he want to get our hearts ready to get out of here come on we ain't got time to be sleeping it's like putting things off to tomorrow just like i was telling my son moses i said a lot of people put god out to tomorrow but tomorrow never came for him just like the man he told the man he said now food you're going to build barns but you didn't know the day that your soul was required a lot of people don't know that their soul is required a lot of people get up and walk out and turn their back on god don't know that this might be their last chance come on but don't let it be your last chance but if it is your last chance make the best of it give god your life give god your heart while you still got blood running warm in your veins tomorrow ain't promise tomorrow i promise but i know one thing if the sun don't rise tomorrow come on like they sing that song in the morning when i rise give me jesus the only way you're gonna have jesus when you get up and rise you're gonna have to have them when you go down at night come on lay down with jesus i'm rising up with jesus [Applause] amen rides up in the fight amen glad for rebel wolf tonight said if he's going to be here he's here amen rise up and fight amen you know i was talking i think that was me and rem wolf i said life is past fast we approaching that big seven of them life is passing fast if you knew how many you remember when you were the baby see i wanted to act like i thought that'll wake up somebody you remember when you was a baby but you did most of us can't remember when we were babies but somebody in here probably can remember when you was a baby especially the children your parents can remember when you was a baby and now you might be 10 12 15. 16 20 30. but somebody remember when you was a baby time one thing about when you get a little age on you life began to get so short and you realize how rapid it is it's so fast and you never knew that life was going to be so short that's why it says a few days a man that's born of a woman of a few days full of trouble if you knew that it it's going to be that show then you'll give it all to jesus because it it's just a little it's just a little space you blank your eyes and you 70 years old and then you look back what did i do between the dash what did i do what did i do in life that was valuable what did i do in life that was meaningful just what did i achieve and what did i accomplish all the worldly things of vanity well i played football i did this i did that that ain't nothing because why it won't mean nothing because you can't carry that across the on the other side somebody said when i got rich i became a millionaire what good is he going to do yet well i sometimes we're glad that we achieved certain goals finish school you did this you did that we thankful to god for that but i'm gonna tell you something way greater than that the prophet of god says california he said that in the 60s he said california was sinking so many um i think he i don't know how high the word it but he said it was sinking every day every day so many inches of california so much of california was sinking you see you'll find out later so if it's sinking every day look how long it's been next thing you know california you're just gradually sinking under the ocean and i'm saying when the earthquake hit japan the other day i think it was japan that hit and that west coast is just shaking the whole world is shaking everything is shaking brother and sister everything is unstable life if you if the young children here knew that even if you got to be 70 years old it's gonna pass like that so you got to take advantage of life itself lord how can i please you everything you do lord how can i please you he's he should be the sinner he should be the first how can i please you if you don't do that now you'll look back and you'll wonder i was just see solomon at the end of the journey he said vanity vanity said to preach all his vanity but that was at the end of his journey he looked back and he saw he had 700 wives 300 concubines was called the wisest man on earth and all that but all of that at the end he said to the young people serve the lord in the days thy youth when the evil day because one day the evil day is gonna approach one day you got to die okay god bless you god bless you tonight you feel all right i wish we could come with with every come with a joy and and just forget about everything your troubles your problem everything and say lord i come to worship you for a little while i come to praise you for a little while if every one of us get that in mind i tell you we can have real church we can have church and we just come and say lord i i got one thing on my mind i come to worship the lord that's all that's all i got one thing on my mind forget about everything as i come one thing on my mind worship the lord amen and sometimes what we give to the lord he don't want it he didn't want what cain gave him and he don't want what we give him sometimes but if we come right amen god accept it what is it you'll find so many blessings that god gonna give you amen because he accepted your worship but we give him we don't know what to give him but when you you know what to give him you know what we're supposed to do and it's it's not that we don't know we know amen and you know what's going to please god that we give god our best give god everything give god our best everything we you know when we don't we feel it like praising him we got to praise him when we don't we we don't feel good we don't feel happy so tired we we're home now but we're still going to praise the lord amen come with some joe you see somebody take up your slack sometime somebody took up my slack sometimes because somebody ought to be amen praise god and then when they when they if their turn they'll lift everybody up and then it's your turn the next time but god have somebody that's gonna lead amen god bless you we thank god for you again thank god for the word thank god for your coming i want to give uh reverend ruffa a chance to greet us and say something to us whatever's on his heart go right ahead you can come up or you can stand back there either way you want to so what's been already said this come from the book of hebrew it says in verse 13 chapter five i was just reading over and there's a lot of power behind it it says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil a lot of people say that they don't want to hear nothing but the truth that's one of the biggest lies they've been told because when you tell them the truth they run they don't want to hear you're saying things that step on their toes they go from church to church they start lying running being a coward rather than facing facts i'm glad i came because i heard two young men that deliver a real good message always understand that truth the books of the truth shall set you free do you know how many slaves it is to hearing things that they want to hear and not what they need to hear the truth shall set you free i would rather be free than to be anybody's slave and i thank brother simon for giving me an opportunity to share such things because y'all got to find minister ministry with all the singing women guys his son i just asked him the other day i said is it one of your sons that's enter that's interested in the in the ministry remember that he said you know i ain't real sure but i can't tell because i just seen one he did a good job and if he did a bad job i would say that too that's being honest that's been truthful and that's being scraped if you can't see i'm the kind of person that i don't need a friend that's gonna agree with everything i say i don't need a yes ma'am i need for you to challenge me and let me know when i'm wrong i talked to him just the other day about some language i used at a eulogy but i was out of turn he said my daughter had to teach me how to be humble and not use that kind of rhetoric so we counseled each other to a degree and then we came up together set a newspaper who knew that we would be in the position that we're in because we've been friends for i know almost 60 years 50 years because he was a newspaper he was in third grade had a job hustling knew what the value of trying to help his parents trying to help himself now he's helping you and his cheering is helping you so i thank god for him being my friend and then his wife the beautiful person to have three children and all them three children are successful in the fields that they went in and actually was homes by their mother is a terrific thing you all need to be thankful for what god has blessed y'all with a decent pastor because a lot of them out there are not decent you all know and i know it but you got a decent pastor and all his children is involved as well as his wife in the church that's power that's unity thank god for him for being my friend because i love him thank you [Applause] praise god praise the lord amen thank god for reverend wolf and you always check on the take on us all years and years when we came back he just come by the house and check on us i said i got somebody to come by and check on me amen you know just check on us he brings some with him i bought something for the children i bought something for y'all hey it's some kind of package come to give yourself we was having a family situation a rough time and i needed some help and i asked him could he help me and he helped and i said no i said i'll never forget the help that he helped us with and i was saying it meant so much to somebody to stand by you and help you out when you really needed it i don't think nobody else could have done what he done no i could have could have chosen anybody else but they couldn't do what he done god just had him to do it so i thank god for him god bless you let us stand i i did you uh the workshop are you going to have it tomorrow you're not having it anymore so y'all turned in your work y'all sheets uh all you're gonna
