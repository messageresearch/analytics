[37:05] god bless you you'll be
[37:09] god is good amen
[37:12] we want to talk this morning about
[37:15] being persistent or perseverance
[37:18] and perseverance means to
[37:21] uh
[37:22] be persistent
[37:25] and
[37:27] making a goal
[37:29] you're persistent i
[37:32] was i praying this morning and i said
[37:36] and in my prayer i was going a different
[37:38] way
[37:40] for this morning but as i was praying
[37:42] this morning
[37:44] and it was dealing with giving up too
[37:46] easy
[37:49] we give up too easy
[37:52] we want something from god but
[37:54] it seems as though sometimes we
[37:57] uh if it don't happen quick enough or
[38:00] fast enough
[38:01] we tend to say it's not the will of god
[38:08] but
[38:10] we tend to make excuses
[38:13] but this woman had a need with her
[38:16] daughter
[38:19] and she wasn't going to give up easy
[38:23] and i'm saying once
[38:28] you hear from god and you know it's god
[38:33] you know so many people give up on their
[38:35] salvation when things get a little uh
[38:38] tough and the tasks get a little hard
[38:41] things just ain't going so smooth in
[38:43] life
[38:45] some folks give up easy
[38:48] amen they come in shouting and dancing
[38:50] and praising the lord but letting life
[38:54] struggles come
[38:56] people are so quick to give up on god
[39:02] praise god it's only because
[39:05] i don't think they're certain uh are
[39:07] they sure
[39:10] amen
[39:12] we must be certain of god
[39:15] we must be sure that we heard from god
[39:22] see once you've heard and you know you
[39:25] heard from god
[39:27] it's not easily
[39:28] amen that you're going to give up so
[39:31] easy
[39:36] oh brother and sister if you want
[39:38] something from god
[39:40] you know you can't get it nowhere else
[39:42] but god
[39:46] if you want it bad enough
[39:48] you're not going to give up easy
[39:52] oftentimes we want god
[39:54] they meant to do something for us but we
[39:57] give up they meant too easy
[40:00] we don't try hard enough
[40:03] you know everything
[40:04] life comes with the price
[40:07] and some folks amen
[40:09] because they don't want to pay the price
[40:11] for what they want
[40:14] sometimes it's it's a certain job a
[40:17] certain
[40:18] uh you set a goal and you want to be
[40:20] amen perhaps a doctor lawyer maybe you
[40:23] want to be a teacher or or something
[40:26] that you set out a goal in your mind
[40:29] this is what i want to achieve
[40:32] there'll be a lot of obstacles and
[40:34] things in your way but if you set out on
[40:37] that goal you must be persistent
[40:41] amen it's just how bad do you want it
[40:46] are you certain that's what you want
[40:49] but i find we're living in a world where
[40:51] people are uncertain they have no goal
[40:56] young people seem sometimes to have
[40:59] nothing that they want to try to achieve
[41:02] in life
[41:04] they have no goal and amen and so they
[41:08] just uh you know they'll do anything
[41:10] because they are not looking forward to
[41:12] nothing they're not trying to achieve
[41:15] anything
[41:18] but when they set out that i have a goal
[41:21] in sports amen there's a price for
[41:25] lebron james and amen tiger woods and
[41:29] different people they set out amen their
[41:31] parents set them on a certain pathway
[41:35] and sometimes the culture set them on a
[41:37] certain pathway
[41:39] and amen and sometimes in our lives your
[41:42] mother or father grandmom or somebody
[41:46] that sets you on a certain pathway
[41:49] now you might deviate from that pathway
[41:52] but sometimes amen amen and maybe with
[41:56] uh serena and
[41:58] venus or whatever amen
[42:00] that died amen he he had a vision in
[42:03] mind and he set him on that pathway
[42:07] amen and
[42:10] it's something about them going along
[42:12] with their parents vision
[42:16] and they were able to enjoy the trip
[42:20] you know it's an enjoyable trip if you
[42:23] amen are sudden
[42:26] you come on one accord with the
[42:28] journey but the journey becomes
[42:31] difficult when you don't want to do amen
[42:34] the pathway to the parent sexual and
[42:37] grandmama and granddad and amen mama and
[42:40] dad set you on a pathway but you don't
[42:43] want that in your life
[42:46] you know it's something about
[42:48] the god of abraham and the god of eyes
[42:51] and in the god of jacob amen god said
[42:54] abraham i know you tell your children
[42:56] and your children children so i'm going
[42:59] to bless you
[43:01] because i know you're going to tell them
[43:03] the right thing you want to lead them in
[43:05] the right direction so abraham i'ma
[43:08] bless your seed
[43:10] and your seeds are going to be at the
[43:12] sand of the seashore amen praise god
[43:16] i'm going to bless you
[43:19] amen because i know you'll keep my word
[43:23] i know i i i can trust you i can put my
[43:26] confidence in you
[43:29] brother and sister how about god don't
[43:31] god
[43:32] you know god knows us
[43:35] amen he knows every mistake you might
[43:37] have made in life and every mistake you
[43:39] may you're going to make in life but yet
[43:42] god looks beyond that amen he sees a
[43:45] pathway
[43:47] amen
[43:49] is whether or not you see what god sees
[43:51] in you
[43:54] it was on one occasion
[43:56] amen
[43:57] god called the man of god you great man
[44:00] of battle and he was
[44:02] he didn't see that in himself
[44:04] and sometimes until we can see the
[44:06] vision for ourselves
[44:08] we're not able to achieve or not able to
[44:11] positionally placing and where we're
[44:13] going
[44:15] forgetting and said if god be with us
[44:18] then we'll be all his miracles which our
[44:20] fathers told us about
[44:23] amen
[44:25] sometimes we seem to be least of all we
[44:27] don't seem to know they meant that
[44:30] that i'm a great man of valor that amen
[44:33] god can
[44:34] deliver the million nights say man
[44:38] god's going to use me me me amen and
[44:41] sometimes we can't see what god sees in
[44:45] us
[44:47] amen but if god said it amen you can
[44:50] believe that god can do it
[44:54] whatever he says
[44:55] [Applause]
[44:56] he'll do it for you
[44:58] praise god
[45:01] you know
[45:02] i was looking this morning that
[45:06] look let's just look at genesis 6.
[45:09] but by the grace of god you look at
[45:11] certain things in life
[45:14] and i believe we're at the junction of
[45:16] time where this world has come to his
[45:19] end
[45:21] i believe that all the signs of the
[45:23] times are telling us we're at the end
[45:28] and if we're at the end amen then
[45:31] there's got to be some people that are
[45:33] positioning place to go into god's ark
[45:39] amen but we must understand amen if
[45:42] we're at the end and amen the days that
[45:45] we are not living in are the days locked
[45:48] until the antelope of your world amen we
[45:51] must understand that if we're at that
[45:54] time lock into the flood amen then we
[45:58] must know amen the things that happening
[46:01] at that particular time
[46:04] but the bible says jesus christ is the
[46:06] same yesterday
[46:08] and today and forever
[46:12] if he's the same god
[46:15] then god you know somebody says history
[46:18] got a way of repeating itself
[46:21] are you with me
[46:23] what god did in shadow form in the old
[46:26] testament he did it in reality form in
[46:29] the new testament
[46:31] are you with me
[46:33] so there are things that are
[46:34] materializing and happening all around
[46:37] us
[46:39] praise god but yet we can't see
[46:43] amen we don't understand what's going on
[46:46] you know
[46:47] sometimes we don't want to know
[46:50] we're so busy we try to cover up amen
[46:53] when god amen is warning us and trying
[46:56] to tell us and get our attention
[46:58] sometimes we say no
[47:01] this just happened coincidentally amen
[47:08] sometimes we push god to us to the side
[47:11] amen no god trying to speak to us in
[47:13] every way we don't want to hear him
[47:18] why because look here uh genesis 6 and
[47:22] 13 i believe it is it says here it says
[47:26] and god said and to know
[47:29] the end of all flesh has come before me
[47:32] for the earth is full of what
[47:36] violence
[47:37] how many of you believe that the earth
[47:39] is full of what
[47:42] how many you know colombia is full of
[47:44] violence
[47:46] every time we look around somebody's
[47:48] shooting or killing
[47:50] somebody think about the
[47:53] other little lady who just got killed
[47:58] i think it was 90 something years old
[48:02] and they somebody went and killed her
[48:04] amen
[48:06] so here here we are the
[48:09] earth is full of violence
[48:11] violence in the school
[48:14] somebody might come on this job and
[48:16] shoot up people
[48:19] i was just praying for a young man he
[48:20] was at work
[48:22] and he was just in the heart unit
[48:25] and uh i prayed for him this morning and
[48:28] somebody came to the job site and
[48:31] started just shooting that rambling
[48:37] nobody knows why he
[48:41] he's been on life support several times
[48:43] and
[48:44] but god's mercy and grace is still with
[48:46] him he just had
[48:49] just as in the heart unit and now he
[48:51] told me this morning i'm going home now
[48:54] in a little bit amen
[48:57] so uh he here here we are where people
[49:00] the violence is everywhere
[49:02] can't go to school without violence you
[49:04] can't go to work without violence
[49:06] everywhere you go is violence everywhere
[49:10] well that's how i was in the days of
[49:12] noah
[49:17] and the thought
[49:20] violence through through them
[49:23] and behold i will what
[49:26] i will destroy
[49:28] them with the what
[49:31] i think god is looking down now and
[49:34] seeing that
[49:36] i remember elderly brother in mullins
[49:40] he's just saying he
[49:42] he said your time my time
[49:45] time is winding up
[49:47] destruction's in the land
[49:49] and god's going to move his hand
[49:52] your time my time
[49:54] that was brother grover smith
[49:58] amen your time my time
[50:01] time is winding up
[50:03] and he had one of those old-timey voices
[50:07] it was very coarse and
[50:09] and he said your time
[50:12] he wasn't
[50:14] let me go hit him
[50:16] your time my time time is winding up
[50:20] it says
[50:23] make thee an ark
[50:25] a golf award room
[50:27] and so forth and then he told him
[50:30] um
[50:31] it was a time to build an ark because
[50:34] god knew the oncoming storm was coming
[50:37] so i'm gonna get you to do something for
[50:39] me no
[50:42] and you know what happens when god just
[50:45] looks down
[50:47] and he chooses a certain folk
[50:51] you know this is an individual walk
[50:53] i mean this is not a family thing
[50:57] amen just because god uh and though god
[51:00] uses families it's not a family thing
[51:03] it's an individual
[51:04] thing
[51:06] as mama said to me son
[51:10] i'ma pray for you that god would open
[51:12] your eyes
[51:14] amen because as a teenager you know you
[51:16] seem to be blind
[51:20] amen the way i dressed the way i wanted
[51:24] to style and file and look

[53:42] you know what i'm saying
[53:44] you know it's certain things are attract

[53:55] supposed to be
[53:58] don't appetize it if you ain't

[54:12] so what what happened to me when they
[54:15] were talking to me
[54:17] i heard a voice
[54:21] and the voice said to me take off your
[54:24] shoes
[54:26] the ground you standing on is holy
[54:28] ground
[54:30] i say
[54:33] you know
[54:34] it just about blew
[54:37] me off the corner
[54:39] tears came to my eyes i know that nobody
[54:42] knew
[54:43] i said i ain't i i
[54:45] i won't tell nobody this
[54:47] because i started having experience at
[54:49] the experience
[54:51] i say i'm not telling anybody this no no
[54:54] no no
[54:56] because people are going to say
[54:59] the lord calling you to preach son and i
[55:01] said i'm not going to do that
[55:03] not me never ever i'm not going to
[55:06] preach
[55:08] and folks have already told me god
[55:10] called you and i said he ain't he
[55:13] not me i'm not doing that
[55:15] you know
[55:16] and i said i'll never stand up in front
[55:18] of people because i wouldn't even do it
[55:19] in school
[55:21] so
[55:22] here it is
[55:23] i went home
[55:26] all of my styles and files i mean
[55:29] hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
[55:31] of clothes
[55:32] i got rid of them
[55:37] my sister and her husband is the bishop
[55:39] with the pastor she said
[55:42] you don't have to do this outside
[55:45] you don't have to give away you don't
[55:47] have to get rid of all your stuff
[55:51] at that time
[55:53] i wasn't going to tell her nothing
[55:54] because i didn't want nobody to know
[55:56] that something was happening down you
[55:58] know these are things you keep hear away
[56:01] secret because folks are trying to push
[56:03] you where you don't want to go
[56:05] and i'm not going to tell them
[56:09] then they tell a strange thing they
[56:11] called columbia tell my mama
[56:14] you know the boy you know something
[56:16] happening to this boy
[56:17] you know and everybody trying to talk to
[56:20] me but i kept these things in my heart
[56:22] because i'm not going to tell people i
[56:25] ain't just coming to church you know
[56:28] a lot of folk just come to church you
[56:30] know i i you know i i'm in church
[56:33] because
[56:35] when i'm i'm ready to play professional
[56:37] football
[56:38] and stuff like that and i think i'm
[56:40] going somewhere that way
[56:42] then all of a sudden somebody's stopping
[56:44] me and something going on with me
[56:48] are you with me
[56:49] so when god began to move in your life
[56:52] and things begin to change and you can't
[56:54] explain that to nobody you don't try to
[56:56] explain it
[56:58] when god is speaking to you as an
[57:00] individual amen you don't try to tell
[57:02] people what god they don't believe god's
[57:05] gonna talk to you
[57:08] they don't believe what's going on in
[57:10] your life is that god is doing these
[57:13] things
[57:15] so i knew nothing and then if you tell
[57:17] them god doing that
[57:19] people might look at you a little
[57:21] strange
[57:22] i remember my sister
[57:24] brundo she was you know mama used to
[57:26] pray for her all the time and every time
[57:29] you saw her
[57:30] she wouldn't dare come in mama house
[57:32] with a beer
[57:34] but she had a little cup sipping out
[57:36] like she got some water
[57:40] and she's sipping out the little cup
[57:42] every time you see it you got to look up
[57:45] and she's drinking
[57:47] beer or something
[57:49] and mama you should you know
[57:52] talk to him about the lord sometimes i
[57:53] said mama just let him go
[57:56] she said i can't help it i gotta tell
[57:58] them about the law i got to tell them
[57:59] they need to come on sir the lord
[58:02] anyway
[58:03] the fourth day one morning mama had died
[58:06] and four day one morning
[58:08] brother got up
[58:11] and she's and she was crying and weeping
[58:14] and she was
[58:15] she was shacking up and everything
[58:18] she said
[58:20] the lord saved me the lord saved me and
[58:23] she was old boy she know she's going to
[58:25] wake up the whole neighborhood the lord
[58:27] doesn't save her
[58:29] she had a cadillac and she told a fella
[58:32] hey you have the car you have everything
[58:36] i i got to get out of this life
[58:38] you know when god speaks to you
[58:42] amen it doesn't matter where you're at
[58:43] when god speaks to you things change
[58:48] it doesn't matter how many times you
[58:50] come to church amen but
[58:53] it's somewhere along the line you got to
[58:55] know when god is talking
[58:58] and when you come to grips with that god
[59:01] was talking to me all the time but i was
[59:03] hardheaded and i wasn't listening
[59:05] and then and you know when god keeps
[59:08] speaking amen he make it a little bit
[59:10] more rocketer
[59:14] you just go on amen
[59:16] you you coming if you
[59:21] you might come
[59:23] lame and crazy
[59:25] but you come and have god and you belong
[59:27] to god
[59:29] you're gonna come
[59:31] don't worry about the thing you might
[59:33] not come the way you want to come
[59:35] but you comment if you belong to god
[59:41] and you know
[59:42] i had that decision i i
[59:44] i felt like god told me
[59:47] you know
[59:48] it's all right you go down that road
[59:51] but this is what's going to happen to
[59:52] you if you go down that road
[59:55] and and sometimes you almost can look at
[59:58] people pathway as a minister you you've
[1:00:01] seen it so many times you can look at
[1:00:04] decisions folks are making amen and they
[1:00:06] think they can just get out of it so
[1:00:08] easy
[1:00:10] amen when i get ready i'm gonna serve
[1:00:12] the law huh
[1:00:15] i've had so many that come and say
[1:00:18] you know
[1:00:19] i remember i was baptized in most of the
[1:00:21] city of mullins especially the young
[1:00:24] people
[1:00:25] sometimes 10 and 12 a week
[1:00:29] on the block cleaning the block drug
[1:00:31] dealers everything you know
[1:00:34] and then uh one sister she would tell
[1:00:38] her sister got baptized his neighbor the
[1:00:41] street got baptized and i got the young
[1:00:43] people coming she was tough she said
[1:00:46] i'm not going to be like the rest of
[1:00:48] them
[1:00:49] she said when i come i'm coming all the
[1:00:51] way
[1:00:53] and i said
[1:00:54] one day
[1:00:55] she stepped in
[1:00:58] and when she came
[1:01:00] she came all the way for 30 days and
[1:01:02] maybe 60.
[1:01:05] see i'm telling you something
[1:01:08] those that just struggling but they they
[1:01:11] want to go
[1:01:13] they have some struggles they have some
[1:01:15] battles they have some ups and they have
[1:01:17] some down but bit they're determined
[1:01:21] but those just say well you know i i i'm
[1:01:23] riding i made up my mind
[1:01:26] sometimes those don't last too quick
[1:01:29] those that just come easy
[1:01:32] and quiet
[1:01:34] amen don't we have those that came like
[1:01:36] my sister
[1:01:37] brenda
[1:01:39] wide open
[1:01:40] stirred up but she had seen
[1:01:44] the supernatural
[1:01:45] she started seeing visions she started
[1:01:48] seeing things and amen she thought
[1:01:50] talking to people and telling people
[1:01:52] what god said and this and that
[1:01:54] all of a sudden jesus broke into the
[1:01:56] supernatural
[1:01:59] and so by the grace of god
[1:02:01] what happens to you
[1:02:04] when god wants you to break into the
[1:02:06] supernatural
[1:02:08] if you can only you know that little
[1:02:10] small steel voice try to guide you in
[1:02:12] the right direction amen
[1:02:15] those little things that happen in life
[1:02:17] that god began to speak to you what if
[1:02:19] you just take heed to that voice
[1:02:22] what if you just keep on pushing it this
[1:02:24] side and thinking that things are going
[1:02:26] to get better things are going to get
[1:02:28] right when i get ready when i finish
[1:02:32] what i want to do
[1:02:39] no
[1:02:41] no doubt noah probably had
[1:02:44] a lot of things in his mind but he heard
[1:02:46] the voice of god
[1:02:50] they told him what to do to build ark
[1:02:54] i believe
[1:02:55] nowadays the people try to build their
[1:02:58] own ark of salvation
[1:03:01] they got their own way i i'ma do it my
[1:03:04] way
[1:03:07] my own art that gonna save me
[1:03:11] are you with me
[1:03:13] salvation is of the lord it's nothing
[1:03:16] that you can do it's what he's
[1:03:19] done for us isn't that right
[1:03:22] they're gonna build their own ark
[1:03:26] but noah was persistent you know it's
[1:03:28] something that you got a revelation god
[1:03:31] spoke to you and he speak to all the big
[1:03:34] bishops and apostles and oh television
[1:03:38] evangelists and all the great preacher
[1:03:41] people of the world amen the most
[1:03:44] scientific and educated world they meant
[1:03:47] even nowadays they can't make a pyramid
[1:03:50] like they did they don't have to die in
[1:03:53] the different colors that they had amen
[1:03:56] they don't even know how to do it that
[1:03:58] scientific age was more intelligent than
[1:04:00] this age
[1:04:02] but yet noah had a message that blew
[1:04:05] their mind
[1:04:07] he said god said it's gonna rain
[1:04:10] it never rained and all the scientific
[1:04:13] instruments proved to the world that it
[1:04:17] would never rain
[1:04:19] but noah said it's gonna rain something
[1:04:22] that they never
[1:04:24] experienced but noah had a message amen
[1:04:28] same as though this man was ridiculous
[1:04:32] why are you saying certain things
[1:04:35] you know when it comes down to you as an
[1:04:37] individual and your salvation it seemed
[1:04:40] ridiculous to your friends
[1:04:43] it seems crazy to the rest of the world
[1:04:47] but when you're certain that god spoke
[1:04:50] to you
[1:04:55] somebody my friend said hen what's the
[1:04:58] motto
[1:05:00] you think i could explain to them what
[1:05:02] what's going on with me
[1:05:04] so i know not to say
[1:05:07] man i you know the best thing for me to
[1:05:10] do is just be cool
[1:05:12] and just go on and go to church
[1:05:16] and try to get an anchor before you try
[1:05:17] to save somebody else makes your use
[1:05:20] good and sad and that's why people get a
[1:05:23] lot of trouble they go out and try to
[1:05:25] save everybody else
[1:05:27] and they just getting saved themselves
[1:05:30] sometimes you got to anchor and be
[1:05:31] certain of god and get your faith
[1:05:33] anchored
[1:05:34] and get solid and established in the
[1:05:37] faith people make so many mistakes amen
[1:05:40] you're trying to get them in and you
[1:05:42] halfway in yourself
[1:05:45] that's what happens
[1:05:47] so we got to realize that we got to get
[1:05:50] our anchors
[1:05:52] and so i realized i want to include
[1:05:53] myself and you know i i realize i still
[1:05:56] i'm still working i'm a work in progress
[1:05:59] so god's still moving in my life and i i
[1:06:02] still got things that god is dealing
[1:06:04] with me i don't know whether i've
[1:06:06] totally got the victory yet
[1:06:09] praise god so i need more things amen
[1:06:12] amen to i need to die to some more
[1:06:15] things in my life
[1:06:17] you know this is a journey but amen the
[1:06:19] journey is just ain't complete when you
[1:06:21] when you get saved amen you got to get
[1:06:24] sanctified and when you get sanctified
[1:06:26] you got to get the holy ghost and when
[1:06:28] you get the holy ghost you got to live
[1:06:30] it praise god
[1:06:34] so the journey amen god takes you on
[1:06:36] that journey
[1:06:38] as an individual this is an individual
[1:06:40] thing
[1:06:41] and you can't explain that to everybody
[1:06:43] you can't talk to everybody about that
[1:06:46] and then even some folks been sitting
[1:06:48] around 20 30 years in the church and
[1:06:51] they joined the church and they
[1:06:53] they think the church save them or the
[1:06:55] bishops save them
[1:06:57] or whatever amen they they don't have
[1:06:59] the experience that you have so when you
[1:07:02] talk about it they get jealous of you
[1:07:05] when you say god was dealing with me
[1:07:07] they talking about god dealing with them
[1:07:10] like they somebody special you are
[1:07:11] special
[1:07:13] god knew you were special yeah he dealt
[1:07:15] with you
[1:07:17] amen because you were worthy
[1:07:19] you are special to him
[1:07:22] so people
[1:07:23] well i've been going to church 34 to 50
[1:07:26] years and here come this little boy
[1:07:28] talking about god

[1:07:54] followed
[1:07:55] they encouraged me they set me down they
[1:07:58] told me about the witches and the
[1:08:00] witchcraft and
[1:08:02] all that kind of stuff
[1:08:04] you know
[1:08:04] and i said oh lord i didn't know i was
[1:08:06] gonna come in contact with all that
[1:08:08] stuff
[1:08:09] but you know if you save long enough the
[1:08:11] devil ain't gonna come at you in every
[1:08:13] kind of way he can come at you
[1:08:16] amen and the devil can't get you he's
[1:08:18] gonna come against your family he gonna
[1:08:20] come against your wife he's gonna come
[1:08:22] against your children the devil is after
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:26] are you with me
[1:08:28] praise god so you got to
[1:08:30] make sure amen that you understand amen
[1:08:33] that you're on your way to heaven but
[1:08:35] you got to fight every inch
[1:08:37] of the way
[1:08:39] that's why paul said i fight the good
[1:08:41] fight of faith
[1:08:43] that i might lay hold on eternal life
[1:08:45] it's a fighting time brother and sister
[1:08:47] praise god you got to fight the hole on
[1:08:50] the gods unchanging hands you got to say

[1:09:01] he's able to
[1:09:03] complete it isn't that right
[1:09:05] god is able to complete it
[1:09:07] and paul said i know whom i believe and
[1:09:09] i'm persuaded that he
[1:09:12] he's able to what
[1:09:14] to keep that which i have what

[1:13:31] good to us
[1:13:32] we don't appreciate the god that loves
[1:13:34] us so much that he saves us
[1:13:37] and we don't really take you fully
[1:13:39] advantage of the salvation that god has
[1:13:41] given to us

[1:13:46] sometimes we don't appreciate all the
[1:13:48] goodness of god i was

[1:18:30] you're formulating in your mind is it
[1:18:32] working for you
[1:18:35] i guarantee you it's not working
[1:18:41] i guarantee you when you think you got
[1:18:44] it all figured out amen you still gonna
[1:18:47] have problems and the same thing that
[1:18:49] you're searching for you'll never find
[1:18:51] it there
[1:18:54] the only place you can find that kind of
[1:18:56] peace and that kind of joy jesus said
[1:18:59] the joy that i give the peace that i
[1:19:01] give the world cannot give it to you
[1:19:05] are you with me so the world can't give
[1:19:09] you this kind of peace
[1:19:11] the world can't give you this kind of
[1:19:13] joy
[1:19:14] so no use in you trying to
[1:19:19] the brothers and sisters once you find
[1:19:20] the pearl of great price
[1:19:23] sell everything you have
[1:19:25] and purchase the field
[1:19:29] i found that pearl of great price
[1:19:34] i found that which my heart longed for
[1:19:40] i'm so glad that i didn't just found he
[1:19:42] found me
[1:19:46] he saw something in me that he
[1:19:49] he knew that i needed him
[1:19:53] he knew that i wanted to be a child of
[1:19:56] god i wanted to please him i wanted to
[1:19:59] serve him
[1:20:03] brother and sister if you're not
[1:20:04] satisfied with this world
[1:20:11] jesus is it
[1:20:13] as our we bow our heads
[1:20:17] certainly lord
[1:20:23] some people are persistent
[1:20:26] but they're going in the wrong direction
[1:20:32] because what they achieved those things
[1:20:35] in this life
[1:20:38] it would not satisfy the soul
[1:20:44] but he said you said he that hunger and
[1:20:46] thirst after righteousness shall be
[1:20:48] filled
[1:20:49] you told a woman at the well
[1:20:52] you drink this water you'll never thirst
[1:20:54] again
[1:20:58] father i believe that same water is
[1:20:59] available
[1:21:03] that thirst that
[1:21:06] every soul has
[1:21:09] but they try to drink the wrong kind of
[1:21:10] water
[1:21:13] drugs and alcohol
[1:21:14] and
[1:21:15] immoral living and all of that but none
[1:21:18] of that would satisfy the soul
[1:21:21] none of that would quench the thirst for
[1:21:23] the soul
[1:21:28] but
[1:21:29] brother sister friend
[1:21:33] will you allow jesus to come in
[1:21:37] because surely he's the answer
[1:21:40] to your heart's cry
[1:21:43] as our heads of my heart are looking to
[1:21:45] him
[1:21:47] is that someone that says
[1:21:51] i need to be more persistent
[1:21:54] i give up too easy
[1:21:56] pray for me brother simmons
[1:22:00] thank you
[1:22:01] thank you
[1:22:02] i want to be more persistent
[1:22:05] i give up to you

[1:22:12] come to a stalemate in my life and my
[1:22:14] walk with god
