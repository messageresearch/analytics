amen and amen God is good amen I want to look at the book of second Peter by the grace of God II Peter 1. it won't be before you long amen God is good II Peter 1 and we'll begin at the first verse if you got to say Amen and it reads Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ you may be seated and read a little further down Grace and peace be multiplied unto you that unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his Divine divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto the life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and to Virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall never be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot seal far off and have forgotten that he was what was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your call and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall for our soul and entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly and to the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may God have bless the reading of his word again tonight just for just for a moment I want to minister to you and a little something that Lord had put on my heart and I ministered on it on Sunday I want to I want to entitle it making sure amen like right here when he was saying you know in the 10th verse he says wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling an election sure you know you want to in an hour that we live in I was thinking you know like I was telling someone last night you know on the phone or just calling me from the job and they were saying something was going wrong with one of the machines and all and he was saying well I think it's doing this and I think this might be the problem and I tell them that's just that's just a guess you know but we got instruments that we can hook up and you can check out the codes and make sure what the problem is other than that or you're just guessing you know so I was thinking about that I said it's a lot of things in life we we guess at you know we guess that or we can just uh Venture like sometimes without Authority and all that but you know it's some some things that we can't do that with because it is your soul at stake so you want to make sure certain things in life I know I just you know examine my own Christian walk and I said Lord you know you know sometimes you would say I can just want to do this I feel like doing this I feel like somebody say let's do this you say okay let's do it or you just feel you just do things and you just do it without consulting God first about it and that says that we all fall under that sometimes but I was examining myself you know the other day and I was just the other day another week and I said you know Lord you know I I don't want to in this hour right now in the time I don't want to be that way you know sometimes in the Christian Journey you got to feel yourself you got to mature from certain things you used to do you just can't do it no more in certain moves you would make without thinking you can't do that no more now you to that point you say I want to consult God on all things no matter what it might seem like this is small or whatever but you know seeking God you know first and then you you feel more comfortable then in that knowing that you sought the Lord but when you just out there you don't know you just out there you just made a move made a decision did did something without consulting the Lord first then you you know you just at the mercy of God then but just thinking about that says you know calling you know you want to make these things uh uh you're calling on your election and sure I was you know just meditating I said you know everything in this life ain't promised you know a lot of things we have goals dreams and all those things and this is good but all of it ain't all of this stuff ain't promised the only one thing that's promised and that's one day you're gonna have to meet the Lord one day but when you meet them you want to meet them with a clear conscience that Lord I did the best you know I can do I was looking at some things and I guess I won't be real long tonight if I was looking at some things in the scriptures and how you know it kind of humbled me a little bit looking at Solomon life and how you know after his father David was gone and he had such everybody had such great expectations of them you know to build a house of the Lord and David's son he won't exceed his father strong and all that but you know God came to him and it just kind of humbled me God came to him and talking to him in a dream I was like what will I give you you know out of these things and and that Solomon's reply was Lord he says Lord you know just paraphrasing I'm a child you know I don't know how to go in and come out people got great expectations of me I got a lot of things that that that's a fun to me I got a lot of things I'm in control of I got a lot of things I'm responsible for I'm just a child I don't even know how to go in I don't know how to conduct myself I don't even know what to do with all this responsibility but his thing was Lord I need your help just in a in a in a paraphrase way Lord I need your help God if you would help me to govern your people I just wanted whatever I just Lord help me that I can walk you know in your ways I can do the Judgment right to help me that's what I want Lord and you know God it pleased the Lord that that's what he asked for but I don't think you know and he said since you asked for that I'm gonna give you all these other things but Solomon didn't I can't I wouldn't say he foresaw that coming but in his heart that's what he wanted in his heart that kind of you know just meditating on it just kind of humbled you I says Lord you know in in all things you know you can be a lot of times I was talking with Charlotte last night it was discussing some things and about the ministry I said you know even in the ministry a lot of times you know people they they covered these things want to be in the ministry because popularity or because out in the Forefront but it's a lot of things come with that and not only just in the ministry but was talking about pastoring from one and you know it's talking about certain situations and I said you know it that's the thing a pastor might look good from the out front you know Forefront because look like they got a church and they Thrive and they out the Forefront they some great preacher but it's crisis is Gonna Come it's hard times gonna come it's hard man Charlotte was talking about this last night it's some hard situations gonna come not only with you but with you with the members of the church and the other one this situation is going to come it's going to seem to be unbearable then you're going to want to know that your you made your call in an election sure you're gonna want to know that you know in that time I think the prophet of God is looking at something he's saying that somebody was wanting to know was they called or not he was saying you know you want to make sure that because if you don't the devil's gonna tear you up the devil going and it's going to be more than what you can stand he said because but but if God called you then he'll give you you won't be able to to uh get away from it you know it's a part of you because that's your calling it'll be it'll be like say it made easy for you but nevertheless you'll have weapons to fight with because that's the calling that God put you in you know so we look at I was me and Charlotte are just discussing this for a while not saying you know it's some things I said even even in the ministry it's like you know uh your children the devil want to attack your children he gonna attack the preacher children more than anybody else to tear the ministry down you look at the children say hey because everybody didn't know what the devil does you get the people look at your children oh they children and they chill that's what that's the enemy that's what the devil does so all of this comes it in the package you know but a lot of times as as men we seek popularity sometimes we seek out to we take out the things and nobody wants the back seat nobody wants to be that unknown person that person that you know nobody but the thing about it is those are the things that God get Glory out of the little the the little unspoken about brother or sister you know God recognizes that person God has respect unto that person now it's a way you can you can try to manufacture that but no as as a person as me and Charlotte I was talking last night you don't want a manufacture not you can only be what God made you to be you know this house of God you know that he we're building a house of God but he's fitly framed us together you cut out you got to place that God gonna put you in you can't fit in no other place but that you might desire wish that you could fit here or wish that you could do that but that that ain't your lot you got to find out Lord what's your life for my life because that's what God you know whatever you claim to be you know whether you that or not God gonna judge you by it and that's and that's the dangerous part I said God don't let me be like Paul like Paul Peter saying you know to make your call an election sure but he also be given giving out virtues giving out uh a Christian we call them a great Christian virtues giving out things uh guidelines that if you live by these things if you have these things he says you'll never fall he says but these things will grant you Insurance into the into the kingdom of God into the presence of God these things will grant you interest if you have them it says now you know you know we we can go around the line he talk about faith then he's going on The Virtue and all these things but in in these these things that that they aren't just I would say you you don't just say I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get that but it's it's what God brings you through to that thing to those things Trials of life you look at bring you through to that Trials of you know in order for you to have faith it's got to be some situations that's impossible before you you know he said I got faith because everything is accessible moving no what brings about real Faith you you beat a challenge that that all hope is gone real Faith you meet a challenge a situation where it is no hope for you there's no hope for that situation that's the impossible situation then what what happened then then you find out what faith is all about you find out that Faith works with nothing Faith looks at those situations then you but what it is God brings you to that and he's and he builds you like to say looking at you know then the Capstone off you know just to jump around going to love all they're saying the Cap's going off look at people looking at that but these aren't things you know when you look at these virtues and these things you can't manufacture these things you can't put them all on all that you know like that and it'd be genuine and it'd be real you can't the winds are blowing it'll test it'll knock you out it will but what what happens is I'm learning by the grace of God through trials and life and situation in life God shape you to those things you look at Great Heroes of Faith great people great uh Ministries all the time you look at that and you you covered those things but you know to get those things without going through the character you know like say power out characters satanic they get to those things but what brings about you don't see the you don't see the the winds you don't see the like we're saying even when it comes down to pastoring you don't see the the the the crisis they coming hard situation and you can't run from them you can't say I don't want to be a pastor now I don't want to be a minister now you can't run because they came I mean what it is but God built you for that situation right he get you gift it for that situation then it's going to show then or not you know but you say uh oh cause they coming oh Hallelujah I was talking to Charlotte last night we were just talking you know just openly at home and just looking at saying that's why you always pray and say Lord no matter what no matter what I want to be in your will if I never my name is never called lord I'll buy out of me and Lord I just want to be pleasing in your sight amen if you only call me for one battle Lord help me to be ready when that battle comes and all at all costs God I want to make my I want to make it sure my calling and election sure you know one thing Peter saying here that it kind of jumped out about at me he says uh here in the in the in the third verse according to according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that call us the glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these things you might be partakers of the divine nature see I I was saying you know one thing about it is everything that we everything that we're we're embarking upon we realize that is only the grace of God that he's blessed us you know because by Nature we were the children of Wrath the only way we can have the certain spirit that we have or certain uh wisdom or order fellowship with him it's because he has given us blessed us that we can be partakers of his divine nature God you know you think about Peter talking saying this he was a man like you talk about ignorant and unlearning or fisherman curse and swear he didn't know him but by the grace of God somewhere along the line God was going to give him Grace to be a partaker of that divine nature and I thank God that that nature you can look back at that that old nature that old man and say Hey you know it it it it it'll hurt it it bothers you not even think about you could you would even think a certain way or act a certain way at one point in your life but you think you think that because what it is now God has did something in you God has God has changed you in such a way it's not it's not that old nature you took put out the old man you put on the new man is Christ in you now and that's why those things they conflict with the spirit of God you can't even and that's why you hear people even say they've been born again are they uh uh Holy Ghost Field but yet they can still have certain things in their nature in their spirit and be all right with them it it doesn't work like that because when the new nature comes it that old man is put away with those very things that that you could Feast on at one point in your life you can't do it no more you can't even imagine yourself doing that right why because the new man it's a new nature it's a different you can't even see yourself Envision you see might see old pictures and stuff and it make you feel bad but because of what it is you look at those things and you say hey but then you can remember how uh in the book of Ephesians it says that we at all at one point walked that way right in times past but God who was rich in Mercy well with the way he loved us then you look back at those things you know at one point uh especially early in the Christian journey I used to be uh a little ashamed of my my life the way I used to live and all those things I used to feel bad all the time but then I I realized uh at some point that that's my testimony that's that's how I can test I can testify I can look back and I can always be thankful for the grace of God that say that's what I was but look at what he has made me not that I changed myself but when I couldn't change myself look at what he has done I had I had to look the calvary it's not what I could do for myself but I had to realize one day he had already done the work for me and who the son has set free he is free indeed so the devil couldn't hold those things on my mind help me on that guilt trip now I can praise God and testify that I once was bound but now I'm free Hallelujah I once was was lost but now I'm found I can testify now right but what it is but God is God is uh uh brought us into those things that make us like it says to be partakers of his divine nature and I like this I said I won't be long haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through us you know I was meditating on that I said we escape the corruption that is in the world you know we skate we made free from it you know those things had us didn't they bound on your way to hell but you escape he said we had we've been made practice takers of as a divine nature he said well we have escaped the corruption through of the world through lust you know all those things you look at what what is a lot of the corruption in the filth in the world today it's from it's because of lust right people lusting they want more they want this they lost and less than lusting right so it brings them into corruption brings them into those things but Christ has given us an escape we've we're we're one of the Escape ones that have was able to escape those things though that lust that'll drag you into that corruption we we've escaped that now it's not lust but it's love Hallelujah the love of Christ that shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost that's what it is and I say is that you know we find that so I said you know what in this life as we we kind of reiterate on it in this life Everything is Everything is a promise it's only one thing that is for certain you know and even death somebody somebody said death you're going to die but not if you go into rapture so everything ain't promised but one thing you'll meet God one day right but I said just thinking about that he says making your call an election sure that's one thing right make your call on Election sure no matter what it is you might not want to you might pull away from it but God I wanna I want whatever your will is that's what I want everybody can be telling me what I should be doing or what I should be at but God I want what your will is I I'll be all right then come on I'll be all right whatever God's will is that's what I want I saw that's all I want Lord what is what is your will I thought about that if you get a chance read that in First Kings sometimes and Solomon it just kind of it just kind of humbled me down and he said Lord I'm a child I don't know how to go in and come out and I begin to think about that and I begin to pray and I said Lord I don't know how to go in and come out I don't know how to minister to your people I don't even know how to raise these children I don't know how to be a husband I don't know how come on you might think you know how sometimes but what it is God got to teach you God got to show you he got to show you yourself everybody else sometimes we look at and point and want to want to correct everybody else but say Lord I don't know how God I need to be perfect you know he's here talking about the Statue of a perfect man you know from every wit God you do these things you'll never fall God I want to be perfect in your sight but God you got to help me I want you to help me and that's been my prayer you know last last week or so and even these last couple days said Lord I need your help I don't know how to go in I don't know how to come out honestly you know sometimes say that but honestly Lord I don't know how I don't know how but I know I need your help amen [Applause] praise God I said we had so many people Miss that's super super duper short well we thank God for amen him being making sure make your call to the election sure we must be certain that the prophet said you must be certain of God certain that you know him certain that for his will for your life the Bible said know what the hope of your calling make your call in an election sure so you must be sure you must be certain you cannot amen be what he says let me say hi sometimes we're trying to do something that somebody else did covers another man's gift that we can see somebody else he said well I can you know I can do that better but we got to Humble ourselves and see what God maybe you can maybe you can do it super but is that your calling it doesn't make a difference if you can do it better but it's your calling oh yeah I can do it yes but Lord is that my calling we need to know what the hope of our calling is not that I could do it you can do a lot of things but Lord is that your will for me to do this see because that's what we want the will of the Lord Jesus said not my will but let your will so when it's God's will I'm gonna tell you something the flesh don't want to do it if your flesh want to do it it ain't God's will because your flesh don't want to do it and you feel that you're insufficient you feel like you can't get you can't do the job you can't do it but when you feel like you can do it that means it shows the mere fact that that ain't what that is not for you because God want to use he waited to uh getting and got down to the 300. because he didn't want Gideon to get the victory you think it was him doing it and God took Moses when he was young when he got 80 years old and sent him when he was weak because God was going to be the one to get the glory and going to do the job and that's what God does with us God takes those things he said rejected in those things that his spies and those things and that are at least esteem in God Amen he makes the wisdom of the world foolish and God takes those ones that are down and he exalts the humble and he takes the proud and those that are up it makes it come to naught are you with me so when are you making our calling an election sure amen we need to really examine ourselves and see where we stand in Lord am I in the straight narrow see it's got to be straight and got to be narrow the prophet chose the hard way he saw what you know Billy Graham or arrivals and all these great preachers had all the money and all the fame and all the glory but he chose the straight narrow way because you chose the hard way you see the Lord said that's my way that's where a great potion of Heaven got it for you amen you won't get it on this side but you get it on the other side are you but if we try to get what we can get here now you see how folks doing and get get get get now amen but you got to make sure you're getting now see oftentimes still God gives you Grace he gives you blessings it's not that you are worthy of it or not that you can attain the job that you have the house you live in the money the car that you drive everything you got God gave it to you you don't well I work hard God give you strength to work as a lot of people work harder than you it still ain't got what you got are you with me but it's the grace of God that we have what we have and we give all the thanks and glory to God it's not our ability it's him is not what we've achieved or what we have attained or I studied hard and I did this no God by the grace of God God I give you all the glory amen because our works not our works he said least what any man should boast but he said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus it is him that work his in US both the will and the Dew of his good pleasure are you with me so it's God that's doing the work amen it's not you that can do it but it's God that does the work amen you're blessed because God said I will bless you amen I amen I will bless you and I multiply told Abraham a blessing I'm gonna bless you into your seed I'm gonna bless you and where Abraham see by faith are you with me and God you're blessed because God grace is upon your life amen nothing that we have achieved nothing that we can't ever do it's just the mercy and grace of God so he says work out your Soul's salvation work it out with fear and what and trim to work it out amen praise God we'd work because amen Hallelujah the grace of God is working in US but it's not us that work and it's him that's in us doing the work Jesus said it's not me that's doing this healing of Miracles it's my father do the word amen that's why I'm doing it amen that's why I'm walking like I'm walking that's why I'm living like it's because of something inside me not one that's inside you keeping you amen that's he's doing the worry amen not our own ability make sure make you a call in an election sure amen make sure amen thank you brother Ernest thank you y'all for coming we know a lot of people out of town today but you're in town somebody said well you can just shut it down I said no amen you know sometimes God blesses greater when it's just a few give us one more song before we leave [Music] God God blesses you greater when you make that effort to see Keisha come from a long ways made the effort amen you get your greatest blessing when you make the greatest sacrifice are you with me you make that sacrifice and you see what God does He blesses you in a greater way I said I don't know how God is gonna do it and I don't know when he's gonna fix it yeah and now only know yeah God's gonna make away from me and I know he's gonna do it yes he will because for me he never told me and how he's gonna do it love he never
