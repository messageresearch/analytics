Jesus Christ's name we pray amen The Book of Romans the eighth chapter and we'll start reading here at the 28th verse praise God God is good amen it's Mercy to Everlasting his truth and do it to all generation I'll read the first you read next we'll read the 39 together Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together the good for them that love God to them who are the call according to his purpose 29. moreover whom he did predestinating him he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified 31. he despair not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we he not with him also freely give us all things 33. who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who it is even at the right hand of God who also make his intercession for us 35. and it is written for thy saying we'll kill all the day long we're counted as sheep for the slaughter 37. for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities no powers no things present the things that come 39 together no heighten the death nor any other creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord you may be seated amen we want to talk about in that um 37th verse he said name in all these things we are more than what we're more than what conquerors and to conquer means to get a game by using Force is to defeat is to win the war are you with me we're more than conquerors amen and our conquering he says through him that loved us will more than conquerors through him that loved us because of his love for us we can say this morning we're more than conquerors I've been ministering a little bit out of First John hopefully that we can bring it together first John 5 first John 5 and we hopefully we can bring it together we were ministering on faith is our victory amen we're more than conquerors faith is our victory and when we talk about Victory we're talking about conquering faith is our victory and I'll just I won't read the whole thing this when I go to the fourth chapter I just look at that um fourth verse they say yea of God little children and have what uh for first John four and four I mean oh excuse me I I I actually I actually wanted first John 5. excuse me let me let me do five for sure this is what I wanna come on okay five and four for whatsoever is born of God what and this is the what the victory that even our what okay our faith Victory when we talk about Victory amen now in first John 4 he said great is he that's in us than it is in the world now the victory that overcomes the world and to conquer so what I want to just try to bring this together the victory that overcomes the world and to conquer Amen to conquer it means that you have what you have victory praise God many people could sit here this morning and uh be void of victory in their life amen they don't feel like they have conquered anything because it meant the thing amen uh the devil in his own devices have conquered you but this morning amen we want you to defeat and conquer the enemy the things that amen seem to have you in bondage we want you to defeat them to defeat every demon every devil amen that may have come to conquer you or to destroy you for the thief cometh not but to kill the steal and to destroy amen if you can't have joy and peace in this life amen then the place you come to the right place amen you come to the right place that you might understand your purpose for being in the Earth amen because God Amen had in his full knowledge falsaw before the foundation that we had need of a savior amen and if we had need of a savior when there was nobody that could save us God himself they met came down and made himself a body they meant to reconcile man back to God he met somebody said Christ is the mystery of God being revealed they met Christ is the mystery of God being revealed and God himself the Bible says God was manifested in the flesh amen the purpose of him being manifested in the flesh amen the Bible said that he might taste death for every man are you with me so he was manifesting in the flesh justified in the spirit sin of angels preaching to the Gentiles believed on in the world and receive up in the glory amen Christ came to him and to see us in our sinful condition that the devil had a slay in slavery and then bondage to sin praise God the thing that we didn't want to do amen the devil had power over us but God come to give us victory Jesus came to amen that to destroy him amen destroy our enemy amen that's why he said we're more we're just not conquerors we're more than conquerors through him that loved us amen you know I like what he uh what Colossians says amen he says that maybe I turned the Colossians for a minute it's a lot of scripture Colossians 1. amen because we can sit here beneath the Privileges and the blessing I thank God for the song Blessing all of God's blessings belong to us amen uh uh uh unconscious of that or will not amen recognizing that God Amen wants you to receive His blessings then we'll take amen the the the slop that the devil offers us amen and we'll call and we'll make do amen with the things that the devil offer us when God got so much better so he said in My Father's House of many mansions in my father's Kingdom there are many palaces if it were not sure I would have told you they met God God Amen praise God blessings amen that he wants to give to us but like the children of Israel amen failed they came out of Egypt but they never went into the promise as a whole the people amen that God saved from the sin but they never received the blessings amen that God wants us to have in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise God all the blessings are in Christ amen out of possession of the believer amen is Heavenly places so God want to positionally place you in Heavenly places Hallelujah God wants to do that but rather than sister if you don't want it amen nobody could amen make you receive God Amen your Victory is in Jesus Christ all your troubles and all your uh he said and all the stuff we go through in life and all our our disappointments I'm gonna tell you something Christ Jesus would never disappoint you all our problems that we have Jesus is the answer but if we're trying to solve all the problems do all types of means besides coming to Jesus and said Jesus I knew you were the answer but we try all types of means all types of things now in Colossians 1 um praise God he said I I'm just going to skip over a lot of things and go to the 27 verse 1 27 to whom God will make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery to the Gentiles amen see it when God reveals himself to you amen it causes you to understand who you are and when we talk about more than conquerors you understand that through Christ Jesus when he conquered deaf Hell In The Grave that you were in Christ amen just as much as you were in your great great grandparent in seed form in germ form so were you in attribute form and thought form in God so because you were there amen and you were manifested in these last days not in the day uh in the 1800s but this day was just amen in this age and this time you came forth from great great granddaddy are you a man in this age that you were in the mind of God not in the days when Moses those came out of Egypt that was their journey and that was their day not when Noah built the ark that was their day praise God we talk about the Patriots and Abraham and Jacob and so forth that was their time we talk about John the Baptist that was his time but you have a time and we're at the end time and we're at the end of time and you have a day amen that God has called you Amen to fulfill his will for your day the hour you live in God has a purpose that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world he fought knew you and by full knowledge knowing that you would come in this hour and you would recognize the voice of God that would speak to your heart for the hour you live in are you up now so God Amen in his mind knew the Temptations and the things amen that you were facing the challenges of the hour he knew that all the Demons of hell would mind up their wings on the pale horse rider and death and hell would rise are you with me but in the midst of death and Hell riding amen God knew that you needed an eagle anointing to Fly Above the pear horse rider are you with me so God in his wisdom amen prepared when the enemy come in like a flood amen the spirit of the Lord will live up a standard against the devil you've got to have something to fight with amen and God got to reveal what you need to fight within this hour other than that amen you building the ark won't worry praise God praise God the Divine the words she was all right but that's not your day you're living in this hour praise God there's an astronaut age praise God they've gone amen and broke the sound barrier we'll need Amen to come out higher in the Lord praise God it's all right to just come to church but God want to take us a higher level praise God for where the caucus is there what the Eagles we gotten together amen we need of the Bible said Faith come our hearing and hearing the word of God so how can you get you need faith for healing then you need faithful rapture are you up there so usually when you're dealing with faith for healing amen will bring a message that would deal with faith to get you to a place where you can receive your healing amen but when we're dealing with faith for you to believe that the blood of Jesus Christ which is always there to save you from your sin if you accept what he died for God that you might not have a miserable life a sin but God wants to deliver you from the power of sin and death amen and give your life eternal life you know folks uh they look at eternal life and it doesn't mean nothing because they were not ordained to believe it the reason why folks won't receive Jesus because they wouldn't ordained to believe it as in 13th chapter of Acts those were the ordained to eternal life they believe are you with me the rest of them they heard it they walked away as though they heard nothing but those that were attained to eternal life please amen they believe that Jesus had come and done what nobody could do the second character free to heal the broken heart Hallelujah somebody was ordained to believe the gospel amen it's nothing we don't try to put on a whole lot of stuff for the young people amen because the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone to believe praise God the word of God did not lose his power amen it's the same gospel that saved me it's the same gospel that'll save you praise God God don't need to add to his word or take anything away from it if you believe the gospel he'll set you free praise God he'll give you the joy that you need the peace that you need oh he'll give you the stamina that you need to stand up and say thank you Lord oh I'm not ashamed of the Gospel Jesus Christ because it is the power of God to Salvation to everyone that believe Hallelujah praise God folks one a lot of things but they don't want Jesus we're living in a world that don't want Jesus they don't love him and they don't want him in their mouth they say I love him but in the action they turn him away brother and sister if we love him why don't we receive Jesus amen if we believe that he died for our sin why don't we let him into our hearts in other words folks um I believe but they won't receive they shake their head and they'll walk away but yet they say well I believe if we believe then we ought to be willing to receive him we ought to be able to welcome him are you with me and if we welcome Jesus into our hearts we'll find that our life the heavy load that we've been carrying are we lifting a lot of the challenges a lot of things we go through is because we reject God we try to make a better plan a better way of life amen we try to better ourselves and better Our Lives we get more schooling better education better jobs and we live in a better neighborhood and drive a better car or whatever you know what I'm saying we try to better ourselves nothing wrong with those things but without God what what does it mean when you don't have God what does it mean it don't mean a thing isn't that right but the whole purpose of you being in the earth is the worship and serve God that's why he says seek you first to what kingdom of God and his what righteousness and what all other things would be but to see what what we want we want all those other things we want all those other things but we don't want Jesus amen why we want all those other things when we can have all those other things we just got to have God first are you with me he wants first in your life he wants to have preeminence in your life are you with me but we're more than conquerors through him that loved us because he loved us he died for us he showed us that he cared for us brother and sister I'm saying here this morning this is the victory that overcomes the world even how faith faith in God makes a difference faith and trust in believe in him taking him at his word it makes a difference in our lives if you fail to accept what Jesus died for if somebody said if I die and my soul is lost it's nobody fault but mine now brother and sister God gives you the Holy Ghost that you might have power over the enemy the devil that defeated you see what I'm saying conquer and I said conquer means to defeat to get gained get a game by using Force are you with me then you got to force the devil off out of your life you got to force him out the devil is not going to leave you alone because you said ah you don't care how you cry the devil will never leave you unless you force him out how are you going to force him out you're going to take the word of God and you're gonna say I'm standing on your word god amen because we're more than conquered through him that what amen and because God loved us amen he has already defeated death hell in the grave and every demon have already been defeated now the devil don't like it but he's nothing but a bluff [Music] he's nothing but a liar and a bluff amen I don't care what the x-rays say about you got this you got that amen it can say what it want to say but Isaiah said with their stripes isn't that right now you got a right to defeat every devil but you got to drive it out by by force amen he said the Kingdom of Heaven uh suffered violent but the violent takes it by force are you with me if you don't have enough uh gumption inside of you devil you defeated me and you had me all pound up twisted up tied up and Tangled Up but now I come to defeat you praise God Hallelujah when everybody packed up When the Children is the cross over and set the spies out to spot the land some come back to win evil I don't know what side you if you were there in that day amen what would you say Amen when you saw the Giants in the land in the walls cities and everything what would you say if you were back in that day you will say well I'ma tell you what you would say what you're saying now amen you saying that God is not able to help you deliver you to defeat of the devil when God said I died for you amen praise God I gave you power amen after the greater is he that's in you that he that is in the world and this is the victory to overcometh the world even our faith you can conquer I thought you can't conquer oh my God somebody got to believe I'm more than a conqueror wait a minute I'm more than a conqueror David hey God I don't care how tall Goliath is I don't care how much he brags I don't care what kind of demon got you bound I don't care how many devils and how long he had to Bow best time for you to sign up and I will take God at his word devil you can't hold me no longer praise God I'm more than a I'm more than a conqueror Hallelujah somebody loved the situation in the condition that they end but there are others that saying I don't want to be where I am praise God I'm bound and I don't want to be found but you got to rise up and you got to force the devil up for your property amen praise God you got to see your Mountain there like Caleb said I want my mountain amen I I want what God gave to me it's my inheritance amen it's what God Said I can have Hallelujah oh yes what God said you can have and you can have victory praise God the thing that you know folks play Church play like they believe God but they don't really believe it a lot of play play Church playing house and playing playfully house play play Church people playing around as though they believed God but they're not
