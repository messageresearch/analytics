uh as you hold your hand there God's going to make a new covenant let's see what the old Covenant was all about Exodus uh 19 and3 Exodus 19 and3 now it was a covenant that God made him in the Old Testament and Old Covenant Moses went okay 19 and3 Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shallal thou say unto the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptian you know how he drowned them in the Red Sea okay how he plagued Egypt how he Beed you on what Wings on Eagles Wings was he literally bearing them on

above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of what talking about you you you're going to be a kingdom of priests and a what holy nation and a holy nation these are the words which thou shallal speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and called for the Elders of the people and laid before for their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the Lord has spoken will we what and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord it's very important amen and the Lord said unto Moses lo I I come unto thee in a thick Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with them and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes you got to be clean when God speak to you amen I I I I want you to notice that the people said we going to do what you say

but but in here God tells you that a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah said in the 9th verse 8 Hebrews 89 it said not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand and led them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my what not in my Covenant I regard them what not said the Lord for this is the Covenant that I now is now God says now I I will not if you will if you will keep my Covenant then I'm going to make thank you your your promise and your blessing contend upon if you will keep it my Covenant then I'm going to bless you now God saying here if you will do what I say keep my Commandments and do what I say I'mma bless you now look what he's saying here A New Covenant for this is a
