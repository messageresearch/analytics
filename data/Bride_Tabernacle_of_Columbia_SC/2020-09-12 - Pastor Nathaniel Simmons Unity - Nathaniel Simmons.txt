filled all the house where they were sitting she just didn't want to call you unified amen what do you come unified here at home your unity do not start in the church you start at home you can't fake it it got to be real i'm saw when i was young in the lord i saw some young people sit up in the front row to church after they knew there was some such a perfect kid i really admired it out these children almost been told many at home thought i didn't have that kind of unity i thought sometimes you could be too hard on your kids sometimes you can be too easy amen i know someone come up on the rough side of the mountain but i want y'all to take our kids up on the eastern side well mama you better have unity in your home you got to talk to a grown person like they're grown when you get a certain age your your pocari lyric got to change even as a parent your vocabulary must change from a different vocab they're not five they're 20. so your vocabulary got to change in order for you to win that child you got to talk like you got some sex huh you better do what i'm gonna put you out put who he said you better be careful you might throw you out this joke but what i'm saying you got to know how to talk to people they're still your children but you know what they call a child too amen you know and there appeared to them clover tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost yeah filled with the holy ghost see the holy ghost make the difference amen to be in unity in a home the children need to be born again filled with the holy ghost you cannot beat the devil out no child you got to pray they just received the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth you look at your child and sometimes you hate to see yourself repeat especially in females you see them in female form they really get to you now it's all right sometimes you see the male phone once you see that girl mama you know what i'm talking about want that mama see that child when she was a bad child and she see her child do what she did at a certain age she got to think i can save the child your prayer makes a big difference to god when a parent were praying for their children they're not praying just to be afraid my son talked to me the other day he said daddy what you want in life he said i'll buy you a brand new cat like you want a cadillac brand new cat like i buy it for you i look at him i talk to him as a son i don't want that that's the only thing i'm one out of you you give your life to god and you take care of yourself that's that's all i ask some of you huh i'm not used to buy me no cars buy me those so i could look good and running the public i said i don't want no cadillac what i want to see you saying that mean more to me than riding around on the 50 65 cadillac to see my child say thanks to god the most important thing should be to you tonight be like had it right she could have had anything but she said lord he said what you want right now so i gotta give it to you she saved my children that's what she wants that's what a real christian mother and father want is y'all to be saved that's what the pastor wants he wants to see your children raise up in the admonition of the lord come to a point in time when they get a little age on they make the right decision i'm gonna serve god until he called me god will
