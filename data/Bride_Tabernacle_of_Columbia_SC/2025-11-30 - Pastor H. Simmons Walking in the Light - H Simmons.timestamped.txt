[39:48] been good. [music] Yes, he has.
[39:56] [music]
[40:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:09] [music]
[40:18] &gt;&gt; a mighty good God. Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the songs and the
[40:24] worship and thanks for sump. Amen. Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Appreciate the Lord God. Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; We Amen. I I was kind of stirred this
[40:35] morning in Sunday school this morning. I
[40:38] trust that we
[40:41] recognize who we are
[40:45] and what we come here this short space
[40:49] in time to go back to eternity.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] Eternity has no beginning and no end.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; And eternal life means you have no
[41:02] beginning and [music] no end.
[41:04] Praise God.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; So God is eternal.
[41:11] And God is Elohim. He's a self-existent
[41:14] one.
[41:16] [music]
[41:17] And God is the object of worship because
[41:20] God we created the angels and he created
[41:22] you and I
[41:25] in his image and in his likeness.
[41:29] So we're here
[41:31] serving time
[41:34] [music]
[41:35] to go back to eternity.
[41:39] So by the grace of God, what God
[41:42] had in his mind,
[41:47] what God thought were all about,
[41:54] God had redemption plan,
[41:57] a plan of redemption
[42:02] in God was to be savior. He was in God
[42:05] was to be healer. He had attributes.
[42:10] If there was nothing lost,
[42:13] then there was nothing to be saved.
[42:17] So by the grace of God, God
[42:20] in his infinite mercy and grace,
[42:24] he allowed certain events to happen
[42:28] to work all things to his good.
[42:33] At the end, the devil won't win.
[42:36] The devil is still a loser.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; So no matter what struggles and what
[42:44] battles you go through,
[42:47] God has already
[42:49] given us the victory. [applause]
[42:54] [music]
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Let us stand this morning for the
[42:57] reading of the word. We certainly
[42:59] appreciate
[43:03] the songs of worship.
[43:07] Let us bow our heads and you have a
[43:09] special need, you can lift your hand to
[43:11] the Lord and say, "Lord, I have a need."
[43:15] Certainly, there are many that on the
[43:17] prayer list this morning. [music]
[43:21] Some are going through bereavement and
[43:23] some are going through laying on the bed
[43:26] of affliction.
[43:29] So looking at my niece and
[43:33] seeing her struggle.
[43:38] So as we look at Madonna this morning,
[43:43] different ones, oh God,
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Arthur Lee Paige and
[43:49] Sister Paige,
[43:53] Lord, we think that
[43:56] life is here. But for a moment and in
[43:59] any time, Lord, [music]
[44:02] we can be lying down on the bed of
[44:04] affliction.
[44:07] But God, you able.
[44:11] Touch our brother Arthur Lee,
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Sister Paige today.
[44:17] touch
[44:19] or Donna and
[44:21] Jocelyn and all of those on the prayer
[44:24] list today.
[44:27] Lord, these hands that have been lifted
[44:29] and they have needs this morning,
[44:32] &gt;&gt; you promise in your word. But my God
[44:36] &gt;&gt; shall supply all of our needs
[44:40] &gt;&gt; according to his riches in glory.
[44:44] God, I know you have not run [screaming]
[44:47] out of mercy.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Mercy and grace is still available.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; So we look to you now.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Will you touch, heal, and deliver,
[44:59] &gt;&gt; save, and set free
[45:02] &gt;&gt; filled with your spirit Lord
[45:04] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; For we thank you this morning for the
[45:09] blessing of your word.
[45:11] Amen. [snorts]
[45:13] &gt;&gt; As we stand this morning, uh, First John
[45:16] the 2 chapter, [snorts]
[45:20] I mean First John the first chapter,
[45:22] excuse me.
[45:26] I'll read the first, you read the next,
[45:28] and we'll read the latter verse
[45:30] together.
[45:32] First John, the first chapter.
[45:35] That which was from the beginning, which
[45:37] we have heard, which we have seen with
[45:39] our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
[45:43] our hands have handled of the word of
[45:46] life, too. For the lightest
[45:50] we [snorts] have seen ital
[45:59] us.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That which we have seen and heard
[46:02] declare we unto you that ye also may
[46:06] have fellowship with us. And truly our
[46:09] fellowship is with the Father and with
[46:12] his son Jesus Christ. Four
[46:15] &gt;&gt; and these things rightly unto you that
[46:18] your joy may be full.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; This then is the message which we have
[46:23] heard of him and declare unto you that
[46:26] God is light and in him there is no
[46:30] darkness at all. Six.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have fellowship with
[46:36] him and walk in darkness we lie and not
[46:41] truth. But if we walk in the light as
[46:45] he's in the light, we have fellowship
[46:49] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[46:52] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin.
[46:56] Eight.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have no sin, we
[47:00] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[47:03] in us.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; If we confess our sins, he's faithful
[47:06] and just to forgive our sins and to
[47:09] cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[47:11] together. If we say we have not sinned,
[47:15] we make him a liar and his word is not
[47:18] in us.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Reading word. You may be
[47:20] seated.
[47:23] The message comes from verse seven. If
[47:27] we walk in the light
[47:31] as he is in the light, we have
[47:34] fellowship one with another. And the
[47:37] blood of Jesus Christ,
[47:40] his son, cleanses us from all sin.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; We want to use forth
[47:48] walking in the light.
[47:51] walking uh I was ministering down to
[47:54] Mullins the other Sunday and we were
[47:56] talking about walking in the light.
[47:58] Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; So walking in the light.
[48:03] Now we know the light is that which
[48:05] makes vision possible.
[48:09] And the song is in Psalms 119 and 105.
[48:14] Psalms 119 and 105 began to tell us that
[48:19] Amen. that God,
[48:22] he said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my
[48:26] feet."
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; And a light,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; unto my path.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Walking in the light.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "The entrance of
[48:43] thy word giveth light."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And let us go to St. John 1.
[48:50] St. John 1.
[48:53] It's
[48:56] I think people have lost
[48:59] the vision. They think if I come to
[49:02] church then I'm all right. I'm in the
[49:04] light.
[49:08] They think
[49:10] that if I do this or I do that, then I'm
[49:13] in the light.
[49:16] Light is that which makes vision
[49:18] possible.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; A man that is blind cannot see.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You know, if it was dark outside and we
[49:31] turned off all the lights, it might be
[49:33] that you can have eyes, but you won't be
[49:36] able to distinguish or be able if it was
[49:39] totally dark in here, you couldn't see
[49:41] who's in the room.
[49:44] Are you with me?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Though you have eyes, Amen. Yet because
[49:50] of the darkness, it'll blind you.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; You ever got up in the night and the
[49:58] lights was off and you stumbled over
[49:59] something that was in the floor?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Had nothing to do with your eyes.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; It was It had everything to do with the
[50:10] darkness.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Now, walking in the light. Amen.
[50:18] Having the understanding that Jesus
[50:21] said, "In the beginning was the word,
[50:22] and the word was with God, and the word
[50:24] was God."
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God.
[50:28] All things were made by him. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And without him was not anything made
[50:35] that wasn't made.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh-huh.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; In him was life, and the life
[50:41] walking in the light, and the life was
[50:44] the what?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; The life was the light of men.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question. Are
[50:55] you shining?
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Are you shining?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible tells us that ye are
[51:04] the lights of the world. Amen.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; A city that sets on a hill that cannot
[51:10] be healed.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So he says to us to let
[51:14] &gt;&gt; let your light shine.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Let what?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Let your [screaming] light shine.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the light was the light of
[51:25] men.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; To let it shine. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Are you letting your light shine?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Are you [screaming] walking in the
[51:38] light?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; To walk in the light is to allow and to
[51:43] let your light shine.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; We know we're living in a in a in the
[51:49] evening time. And in the evening time,
[51:53] God said there shall be light.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light causes us to see what
[52:02] God will have us to know.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Caleb like to sing the song that there
[52:09] shall be light in the evening time. The
[52:12] path to glory you shall surely find.
[52:14] It's a waterway. It's a light today.
[52:17] Baptized in Jesus name.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you haven't been baptized in
[52:23] Jesus' name, then perhaps, Amen, you're
[52:27] still walking
[52:29] in darkness.
[52:31] But we want you to Amen. to walk in the
[52:34] light.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; But you Amen. If you know some folks if
[52:40] they're bl uh if they've been blind all
[52:42] their life, then they're accustomed to
[52:44] darkness.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And they know how to maneuver
[52:53] uh uh themselves in darkness because
[52:56] they have been blind all their life. if
[52:59] they learn how to live in darkness.
[53:01] [snorts]
[53:04] &gt;&gt; But if they knew that, Amen. It's
[53:07] possibility that I don't have to be
[53:10] blind.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And that's why the song says, "Amazing
[53:14] grace, how sweet the sound. The same
[53:17] arct like me."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "I was blind, but
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for the grace of God.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; That brought [screaming] life and
[53:33] immortality to the light by the gospel.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad for the light.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because [screaming] of
[53:42] light, I can see.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; At one time, I was in darkness.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't see.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[53:53] Folks with eyes and of understanding
[53:56] will try to tell me about amen. Things
[54:00] that because of darkness and because of
[54:04] being blind don't they can tell me about
[54:07] what they see but I couldn't see it
[54:10] because I [screaming] was blind.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; We were born blind.
[54:19] That's why Jesus said, "Except a man is
[54:21] born again, he cannot understand. He
[54:24] cannot see the kingdom of God."
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, Amen.
[54:30] our understanding must be enlightened.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; He must open up our understanding.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; On the road to Em. Amen. Jesus began to
[54:43] rebuke them fool and slowing heart. Uh,
[54:47] ought not you to believe those things uh
[54:50] which the prophets and the psalms spoke
[54:52] of
[54:55] that thus it is written in dust behooves
[54:57] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[55:00] dead the third day
[55:03] and that repentance and remission of sin
[55:06] shall be preached in his name
[55:09] &gt;&gt; beginning at Jerusalem.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And he opened their
[55:15] understanding that they might what?
[55:18] Understand the scripture."
[55:21] &gt;&gt; God wants you to understand what he's
[55:23] saying.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [screaming] You know, Amen.
[55:27] You would have excused. Amen. So, I
[55:29] don't understand it.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; But Paul says he gave him a gospel that
[55:37] cause all men to see.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The gospel is to open
[55:43] your eyes. Jesus said, "If I've not
[55:46] come, they would have had a cloak for
[55:48] the sin. Because I've come, you have no
[55:50] clue."
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus talked to Nicodemus, except
[55:56] a man be born again.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus could not understand,
[56:00] [screaming] could not comprehend. How
[56:02] can a man be born when he's old? Can he
[56:05] enter a second time into his mother's
[56:07] womb and be born? But Jesus said,
[56:09] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[56:12] a man is [screaming] born of water in a
[56:14] spirit, he cannot what?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; See?"
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you believe you
[56:23] sin,
[56:24] how much you think you sin,
[56:27] without [screaming] being born again,
[56:29] you cannot see.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; You can feel like you understand.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; You can think that you understand. Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; But it takes [screaming] a born again
[56:40] experience
[56:42] &gt;&gt; for you to really see and understand the
[56:44] things of God.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I got to pick back up here. The light
[56:50] was in him was life and the life was the
[56:53] light of men and the light shining in
[56:55] what?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; The light shining in darkness. This is
[56:59] the dark world.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Demon powers are everywhere.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; I was
[57:08] We usually get up something to six, the
[57:10] alarm go off and the alarm go off and
[57:13] the news come on. That's the alarm.
[57:17] The news in the morning and the radio.
[57:22] But just before it came on,
[57:25] I heard a voice says
[57:27] and they asked me a question. Somebody
[57:29] asked me a question.
[57:32] Can
[57:34] a person cast a spell on you?
[57:42] And I was explaining,
[57:46] you know, and then what happened? That's
[57:50] not normal cuz usually the news come on.
[57:55] And when the radio came on, I said,
[57:57] "Huh?"
[58:00] It says the question was to the witch
[58:04] that was on it,
[58:07] "Can anybody cast a spell on you? M
[58:13] I said, "Huh?"
[58:16] And I told my wife, "You know what just
[58:19] happened to me?
[58:22] Somebody asked me the question,
[58:24] can [clears throat] anybody cast a spell
[58:26] on you?"
[58:29] And the witch was explaining
[58:32] how people can cast a spell on you.
[58:36] I said, "Oh Lord."
[58:38] You know, in other words, if you don't
[58:41] have no protection,
[58:43] &gt;&gt; bless.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; She was talking about some sage and
[58:47] stuff. [laughter] I said, "Got to get
[58:48] this stuff out of my room."
[58:52] Some sage and some stuff and and I'll
[58:55] tell you how to work to keep them. I
[58:57] said, "You ain't going to tell me how to
[58:59] work."
[59:01] You see people are are terrorized
[59:06] and afraid.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I met a young man at at Firestone one
[59:14] day and we sat down and I talking to
[59:16] him, young white fellow
[59:20] probably about 19 to 20. He said he had
[59:24] a girlfriend that was a witch.
[59:28] And I was witnessing to him, telling
[59:30] him, "Come on, cuz we cast the devils
[59:32] out of witches."
[59:34] I said, "Bring her to church."
[59:38] He said, "Man, I'm scared." [laughter]
[59:41] Cuz I haven't seen what she do to
[59:42] people.
[59:45] I said, "Well, just just tell her to
[59:47] come on out. You know, we want to meet
[59:49] her."
[59:52] He said, "I'm scared. You don't know.
[59:54] You don't know what kind of power she
[59:56] got."
[59:57] I said, "It doesn't make a difference. I
[59:59] want I want her to see the power of
[1:00:01] God."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:00:07] [snorts]
[1:00:07] let your light
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; shine.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Walking in what?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I don't, you know, the darkness should
[1:00:16] not penetrate the light. Isn't that
[1:00:18] right?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; But you know, a lot of people scared.
[1:00:22] They Christian, but they scared.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; They're afraid of the darkness.
[1:00:31] The demon power that works and lurks in
[1:00:34] the dark.
[1:00:36] You have many people that are peeping
[1:00:40] and creeping.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; They're depending on they they they they
[1:00:46] like Balum.
[1:00:49] Balam said, [screaming]
[1:00:51] Bayrock said to Balam, "I'm I'm going to
[1:00:53] call you up and I want you to curse
[1:00:55] these people.
[1:00:59] I want you to curse those children of
[1:01:01] Israel coming out of the promised land,
[1:01:04] coming out of Egypt.
[1:01:06] Catch them."
[1:01:09] And Ba
[1:01:11] say, "I can't curse what God doesn't
[1:01:13] bless."
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; I want to know. I want you to know if
[1:01:17] you if you cover it by the blood.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; if you walk in the [screaming] light,
[1:01:26] [cheering]
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; praise God. You don't need no help from
[1:01:31] the devil.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Saul. Amen. Samuel was his light. As
[1:01:38] long as Samuel was living.
[1:01:41] Amen. song could go to Samuel and to ask
[1:01:44] her, "Well, what should we do? And when
[1:01:46] we go into battle, what should we do
[1:01:48] here in the situations of my life?"
[1:01:52] Well, when Samuel was gone and Amen. He
[1:01:55] sought this and sought that and end up
[1:01:58] with no supernatural power. When you
[1:02:01] ain't got no supernatural power in your
[1:02:03] life.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God Amen. Look like he hadn't
[1:02:08] showed up.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Look like a things are not moving in the
[1:02:13] right direction.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Bless.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Saul knew about a supernatural God. Yes,
[1:02:19] sir.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; He'd experienced [screaming] a prophet
[1:02:22] that had thus said the Lord.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; But Samuel was dead.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So he went to the witch of Endor
[1:02:33] and he asked her, "Amen. I want you to
[1:02:35] call sir. He said, "Saul," she said,
[1:02:38] "Saul, you done killed all the witches
[1:02:40] and
[1:02:43] a [laughter]
[1:02:44] and don't," In other words, don't kill
[1:02:46] me. He said, "No, I ain't going to kill
[1:02:47] you. Just do this for me. I want you to
[1:02:50] call such and such you up."
[1:02:53] Because the blood has not been shed.
[1:02:57] The devil still had the keys
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; of death in hell.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; But after the blood of Jesus have been
[1:03:06] shed, the devil can't call you up
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; because you're covered by the blood.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; I was in the Fairville, North Carolina,
[1:03:18] and me and Brother Brooks and Witcher
[1:03:22] said that
[1:03:25] we a sister got baptized here and she
[1:03:28] wanted us to meet this great man of God.
[1:03:33] And we walked in the door
[1:03:36] and she went in first and brother Brooks
[1:03:39] went in next
[1:03:41] and the man reached out his hand and
[1:03:43] shook my hand. I said I didn't shake his
[1:03:46] hand. I said, "Dr. Buzzard,
[1:03:50] I don't know how it came out. I don't
[1:03:51] know what happened,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; but it came out my mouth."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And I said, "You ain't nothing but a
[1:03:57] witch doctor. I ain't never seen him. He
[1:04:00] never seen me.
[1:04:02] But I didn't know what was happening. It
[1:04:03] just came out that way. He said, "What
[1:04:06] you call me."
[1:04:09] By that time, the phone rang.
[1:04:13] And he got on the phone. Praise the
[1:04:14] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] And he's asking people, telling people
[1:04:18] things. And every time he hung up the
[1:04:20] phone, it rang again. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. Telling people stuff. But I
[1:04:26] don't call a man Dr. Buzzard. He's a
[1:04:27] witch doctor.
[1:04:30] And I don't know how it come out my
[1:04:32] mouth, but it came out that way.
[1:04:35] When I said that, Brother Luke Brooks,
[1:04:37] look at me.
[1:04:42] Next thing you know, we sat down and his
[1:04:45] black cat [laughter]
[1:04:47] and look like he's going through the
[1:04:49] house.
[1:04:52] We got through. I tell life is real.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Powers out there that people don't know.
[1:05:00] I've had young ladies and seen them bark
[1:05:03] like dogs,
[1:05:05] crawl like snakes,
[1:05:07] talk like men,
[1:05:10] pretty nice looking young ladies. But
[1:05:13] the devil done got in them.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And they said,
[1:05:18] "We want you to cast the devil
[1:05:22] at this person." You cast the devil out
[1:05:25] and she go back and do the same thing.
[1:05:27] The devil get back and they bring them
[1:05:29] back and cast the devil out again and
[1:05:31] come back.
[1:05:34] The devil ain't going to stay out.
[1:05:36] Listen, you want him to stay out and you
[1:05:37] live, right?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Some people give their life to Jesus,
[1:05:43] but they take it back right after they
[1:05:45] give it to him.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And you don't even know sometime you're
[1:05:51] full of the devil.
[1:05:55] All of us was full of the devil.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We were in darkness. We were sinners.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And God don't charge a sinner for being
[1:06:05] a sinner
[1:06:08] for doing sinful things.
[1:06:11] A sinner can't sin because he's just a
[1:06:13] sinner.
[1:06:15] It's the believer that sins.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; A sinner is a sinner. And that's what a
[1:06:22] sinner do. Sin.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; But if you're saved, you don't do that
[1:06:28] stuff.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Y'all want to want to know what happened
[1:06:31] to that that witchcraft doctor?
[1:06:36] I forgot to end this story, didn't I?
[1:06:38] [laughter]
[1:06:41] That witch doctor,
[1:06:44] he kept on praying for people for about
[1:06:46] an hour. Look like phone ranging one
[1:06:49] after another. They call him and he
[1:06:51] praising the Lord. Hallelujah. And tell
[1:06:53] him stuff.
[1:06:56] Then he finally got to me.
[1:06:59] And when he got to me, he sat down and
[1:07:04] started doing like
[1:07:12] I was, you know, I was just young and
[1:07:14] stupid.
[1:07:18] He I said I said you can do all the on
[1:07:22] you want
[1:07:25] cuz I sure wasn't scared. I ain't had
[1:07:28] sense enough to be scared.
[1:07:31] You know what I'm saying? Then he said,
[1:07:34] "I can't I can't get I can't break
[1:07:35] through. I can't break through."
[1:07:39] Then he look at brother Brooks.
[1:07:43] [clears throat]
[1:07:44] See,
[1:07:46] I said, I know you can.
[1:07:49] You know what you got to do quickly?
[1:07:52] When you're facing powers of darkness,
[1:07:55] you got to quickly get yourself out the
[1:07:57] way.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know how to get out the
[1:08:01] way, you going to find out that you
[1:08:03] ain't no match for the devil.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; But you got to quickly make sure you
[1:08:08] confess up.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] and that you in right standard with God.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz you might be fooling with the wrong
[1:08:22] thing.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And you wonder why things can't go right
[1:08:26] with you.
[1:08:30] I first start passing the old people sat
[1:08:32] me down
[1:08:34] tell me don't you eat no red rice
[1:08:39] and don't eat no spaghettis.
[1:08:45] I said I don't know what they talking
[1:08:47] [laughter] about. Then they had to break
[1:08:49] it down to me.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't know what they talking
[1:08:53] about. But there's some stuff people try
[1:08:56] to do to you when you're young
[1:08:59] and think you're out there.
[1:09:02] So they were telling me you're in the
[1:09:03] country now. You going to have to watch
[1:09:05] out.
[1:09:07] Y'all city people don't know about this
[1:09:09] stuff.
[1:09:11] But country people know that people are
[1:09:14] wicked.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And they do wicked stuff.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; They know about the spirit world.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; City people. turn around
[1:09:25] and young people like everything is
[1:09:27] normal. I can do this and that and no no
[1:09:29] no we living in a world that these young
[1:09:32] people have entered into that dark world
[1:09:35] and they call spiritualism and all these
[1:09:38] young people are dibbling and dabbling
[1:09:40] in witchcraft and they don't even know
[1:09:42] what they messing with.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; They they don't wait till they get to
[1:09:48] college. They do in high school. They
[1:09:51] devil and devil and they don't wonder
[1:09:53] what's going wrong with their life and
[1:09:55] what why things ain't going right
[1:09:57] because they won't come under the blood.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; They won't turn their hearts and their
[1:10:04] lives over to God. And they and they
[1:10:08] won't they won't they they want to know
[1:10:10] about the supernatural.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; It's something that a man knows that
[1:10:15] it's something more to [screaming] life
[1:10:17] than just living. They want to enter
[1:10:19] into a spiritual realm
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and they want to have power
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; and they want to they they want to be in
[1:10:27] touch with the supernatural
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; and they want a God that's moves and
[1:10:33] that's alive and real.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And sometime that God is the God of this
[1:10:38] evil age the world.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. the demon powers.
[1:10:44] Reason why people minds are so mixed up
[1:10:50] because they don't see God in the
[1:10:52] church.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; They see people that can sing well, that
[1:10:59] can shout and dance in the spirit, but
[1:11:03] they don't see God.
[1:11:08] There's a hungering and a thirsting.
[1:11:10] They want to see God.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; People want to see the power of God.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; They want to know whether he's real or
[1:11:19] not.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Can he help me?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Can he save me?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Can he heal [screaming] me?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Can he do what the Bible says?
[1:11:34] Lord,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; I was telling one young lady about
[1:11:40] piercing
[1:11:44] and uh and this African girl told her, I
[1:11:48] said, "You know those people that do all
[1:11:50] those piercings?" I said, "They they in
[1:11:52] the spirit world.
[1:11:55] They they a lot of time they witches."
[1:11:59] She said, "Not mind."
[1:12:02] the one I go to and the [clears throat]
[1:12:05] little African girl said, "I looked her
[1:12:06] up on the internet
[1:12:09] and she is a witch."
[1:12:14] You see
[1:12:16] all this piercing and tattooing, all
[1:12:19] that, but God said, "Don't put no mark
[1:12:22] in your flesh." Ain't that right?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And people doing all this piercing and
[1:12:27] tattooing don't know. Amen. It's
[1:12:30] witchcraft that they practicing. Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You said, "Why why are people doing
[1:12:37] that? Why the African used to do it?"
[1:12:40] Because they had voodoo.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And they had all these
[1:12:46] Y'all know what I'm talking about. Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; My that wasn't my subject this morning,
[1:12:52] but I don't know why y'all telling me to
[1:12:54] move there,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; but I let me get away from that and and
[1:13:00] go back to where I walking in the light.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Because sometime you just come to
[1:13:05] church, in and out the church, singing
[1:13:08] and uh having a good time and you don't
[1:13:11] know nothing about
[1:13:13] walking in the light.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You sing about it. you you preach on it
[1:13:18] and and don't know nothing about
[1:13:20] [screaming] walking in the light.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz you ignore the word.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; The the the very word that you preach,
[1:13:29] the very word that you say you believe,
[1:13:32] you don't respect it enough to walk in
[1:13:34] it
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and live by it.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God. See, we hiding behind the
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:45] and using the word for
[1:13:49] our convenience.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But when it comes down to reality,
[1:13:53] [screaming]
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; we don't want to live the word now.
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Paul talks about the preachers that make
[1:14:04] merchandise of the people.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] I was telling the pastors and having a
[1:14:11] fellowship meeting. I said, "One thing I
[1:14:13] ain't going to allow,
[1:14:15] if the preacher ain't living right, then
[1:14:17] I don't want him to preach for me."
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You got too wide, don't preach for me.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Your house ain't in order, don't preach
[1:14:27] for me.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] But see, we allow everything and anybody
[1:14:35] to get in the pull pit
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; and preach the [screaming] gospel.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Even women,
[1:14:46] you know, they
[1:14:48] Lord have mercy. They got no rights
[1:14:50] doing that. Ain't that right?
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; But yet we ignore the word because they
[1:14:55] can preach.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The donkey can talk too. Well, you
[1:15:00] know, go listen to the donkey preach.
[1:15:05] Are you with me?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; The dunkey ain't part of the five-fold
[1:15:09] ministries.
[1:15:11] God didn't ordain dunkeys.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Ordain elders in every city.
[1:15:18] If any be blamed as the husband of
[1:15:19] what?"
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; One wife. Ain't that right?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; God, y'all want revival?
[1:15:27] Amen.

[1:21:22] said, 'Well, you know one thing, you
[1:21:25] know, people were educated, well well
[1:21:28] polished and well well educated. I said,
[1:21:31] you know, if we were sheep,
[1:21:35] you need a shepherd.
[1:21:37] But I said, you know, if you ain't no
[1:21:40] sheep, you don't need a shepherd.
[1:21:42] And one of the sisters, she said,
[1:21:44] "Uh-huh."
[1:21:47] I said, "Yeah, she need a shepherd." She
[1:21:49] said, "What?" and act like I I ain't
[1:21:51] never heard such a thing. Sheep need a

[1:27:42] didn't tell them the truth, you going to
[1:27:44] be charged for them.
[1:27:46] And if you love them, you'll tell them
[1:27:48] the truth. That's right.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But you lose a friend.

[1:28:09] the money.
[1:28:11] I want the money and the popularity. He
[1:28:14] said, "I'll put you up high and I'll do
[1:28:15] this and I'll do that for you. Only
[1:28:18] thing I want you to do is curse the
[1:28:20] people."
[1:28:22] Are you with me? I want you to know,
[1:28:25] Amen. If you want status and you want
[1:28:27] fame and you want glory, Amen. you're

[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Lord not the world,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; neither the things of the world."
[1:28:48] of any uh what got in the church is
[1:28:50] judge so dark till they can't even see
[1:28:53] now
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; people doing any kind of stuff in the
[1:28:57] church
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; and the preacher won't say nothing
[1:29:01] against it
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; but thank God there shall be light in
[1:29:05] the evening time I believe it's shining
[1:29:07] [applause]
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; praise God you may not have a pocket of
[1:29:13] money but you still got the truthise

[1:29:21] to tell the people the truth.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; If the be eight souls go, let the eight
[1:29:25] go.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Let the rest go anyway.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Anywhere they want to go.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; It's important that you walk in the
[1:29:34] light.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; 8 and 12. I says I got to close here.
[1:29:42] Then spake Jesus again unto them,
[1:29:44] saying, I am the what?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And he's the word.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; He's the word.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes people say, "What
[1:30:02] you preach?" What you believe? I believe
[1:30:05] the Bible.
[1:30:07] What do you preach? I preach the Bible.
[1:30:10] What? what denomination you with.
[1:30:16] You know, I I could say, "Well, I
[1:30:18] believe the even the light message," but
[1:30:19] they don't know what that is.
[1:30:24] Ain't no use in trying to explain the
[1:30:26] detail
[1:30:27] cuz they wouldn't know what I'm talking
[1:30:29] about.
[1:30:30] Are you with me?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But God gives us light in the evening
[1:30:36] time, but we don't want to believe it.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz amen, we're accustomed to
[1:30:43] having what we got and thinking that we
[1:30:46] got [screaming] enough. I don't want no
[1:30:48] more. Don't give me nothing else. I just
[1:30:51] satisfied it.
[1:30:53] You know, oh Lord,
[1:30:57] there's always an opportunity to grow.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And when you pass your opportunity to
[1:31:04] grow, man, you become stagnated and you
[1:31:07] become like a cesspool.
[1:31:09] Uh-huh.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I press towards the mark of
