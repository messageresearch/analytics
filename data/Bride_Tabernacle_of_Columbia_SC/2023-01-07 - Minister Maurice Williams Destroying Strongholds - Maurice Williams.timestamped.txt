[38:30] title of destroying strongholds amen
[38:33] let's just buy heads tonight
[38:36] father God in the name of Jesus Lord let
[38:39] your people Lord we've gathered together
[38:41] Lord and Lord no doubt Lord many may
[38:44] have had different activities they had
[38:46] to accomplished today Lord with work and
[38:48] school and different things father God
[38:50] but Lord we've set aside This Time Lord
[38:53] to come together collectively Lord to
[38:55] worship you father God to look into your
[38:58] word Lord and Lord we know that these
[39:01] times Lord these moments these things
[39:03] are precious father God because it
[39:06] allows us to be able to stand in the
[39:09] midst of a dark and evil age just exist
[39:11] Lord
[39:12] so Lord I pray that you will blessed
[39:13] each and every saint that breast pressed
[39:16] their way out tonight father God
[39:19] Lord I pray that Lord you will move me
[39:21] out of the way for the preaching of your
[39:22] word father God
[39:24] because Lord all of these things are in
[39:26] vain Lord unless your people are blessed
[39:28] father God but Lord we know wherever you
[39:30] are father God the blessings abound
[39:33] father God and wherever two or three are
[39:35] gathered in Your Name Lord Joy promise
[39:37] to be in the midst Lord we thank you for
[39:39] that Lord we look to you right now in
[39:41] the lovely name of our Lord and Savior
[39:43] Jesus Christ May the Saints say Amen
[39:45] praise the Lord you could be seated
[39:47] tonight amen
[39:49] hallelujah it's good to be in the house
[39:52] of the Lord
[39:54] you know we still pretty new into the
[39:57] new year amen and you know anytime you
[40:00] you start a new year I think it's always
[40:02] good to reevaluate things
[40:05] I I think it's good to always take time
[40:07] the Bible says you got to examine
[40:09] yourself for it says the letter man
[40:11] examine himself amen and when we take
[40:15] time we we see the things that we
[40:18] overcome amen we we see the things that
[40:20] we had some difficulty against say man
[40:23] we we could take time we look at our
[40:25] victories amen because sometimes we we
[40:28] get so busy and so caught up in life
[40:30] that we forget about the victories that
[40:33] the Lord brought us through amen and at
[40:36] the same time we can look at the battles
[40:38] amen that we had overcome the the hard
[40:40] things amen and as we look at those
[40:43] things the enemy always has a goal of
[40:48] keeping you from pressing towards the
[40:50] mark
[40:51] meanwhile the word of God Amen in the
[40:54] ministry we're always pushing you to
[40:57] press towards the mark amen and as you
[41:00] press towards the mark the enemy now
[41:02] he's a good enemy he's not just going to
[41:04] let you press towards the mark but he
[41:07] wants to put things in your way to keep
[41:09] you from progressing towards the mark he
[41:12] wants to put things in your way to keep
[41:15] you from becoming a manifested son or
[41:18] daughter of God and maybe you can have
[41:21] some minor victories and maybe you can
[41:23] win some small battles but he wants to
[41:25] keep you from fully becoming somebody
[41:28] that can tear his kingdom down
[41:30] so what he does is he uses something
[41:33] called strongholds sometimes amen
[41:37] strongholds are things that you have to
[41:40] overcome
[41:41] strongholds are things that the enemy is
[41:44] entrenched in and that you are going to
[41:47] have to fight to be able to overcome
[41:50] some battles are won and fought easily
[41:53] but some batters you have to sit there
[41:56] and press your way with it amen
[41:59] and by the grace of God that shouldn't
[42:01] scare you because greatest he that is in
[42:04] US
[42:05] the heat that is in the world
[42:08] and there's something that almighty God
[42:10] placed within you that is going to allow
[42:13] you to press the bell in this hour
[42:17] you know when we start to talk about
[42:18] strongholds sometimes people picture
[42:21] these old big things or big things uh
[42:24] big sins that you got to overcome
[42:26] but the strongholds can just be the
[42:28] little things amen
[42:30] a stronghold can just be just a little
[42:33] thing that's just enough to keep you
[42:36] from being everything that God calls you
[42:39] to be amen
[42:40] a little thing that might be just enough
[42:42] from keeping you from being exactly
[42:45] where almighty God wants you to be amen
[42:48] now for you to be able to come out to
[42:50] church tonight amen for you to be able
[42:52] to walk as a message believe in this
[42:54] hour you already have to manifest the
[42:57] testimony over overcome you already have
[43:00] to manifest the testimony of somebody
[43:03] that's overcome stronghold after
[43:06] stronghold amen you you can't walk as a
[43:09] believer in this hour amen except you've
[43:11] been overcome you can't walk us believe
[43:13] in yourself accept you've overcome some
[43:16] strongholds amen
[43:17] God presents challenges before us amen
[43:20] and by the grace of God we meet those
[43:23] challenges and we cast it down amen
[43:27] if there is a stronghold odd challenge
[43:30] that would keep you from going further
[43:32] with God Amen by the grace of God we got
[43:35] to cast it down
[43:37] sometimes people go through yeah amen
[43:39] and they say well well you know I
[43:41] struggled through this thing and I
