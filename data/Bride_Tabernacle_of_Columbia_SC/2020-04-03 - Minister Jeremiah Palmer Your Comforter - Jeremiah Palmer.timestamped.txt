[18:35] that we a man can be assured that no
[18:39] matter what happens or what common goals
[18:41] that a man you can have peace tonight
[18:45] mmm st. John 14 let's start there 15
[18:53] first I wanna read down to the 26 if you
[19:01] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[19:08] pray the father he should give you
[19:11] another comforter that he may abide with
[19:15] you forever
[19:18] I like that amen even the Spirit of
[19:22] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[19:26] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[19:30] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[19:35] with you and shall be in you I will not
[19:40] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[19:44] yet a little while and the world seeth
[19:47] me no more but ye see me because I live
[19:50] ye shall live also and that day you
[19:54] should know that I am I am in the father
[19:57] and he and me in are you he that hath my
[20:02] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[20:05] that loveth me
[20:07] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[20:10] father and I will love him and will
[20:13] manifest myself to him
[20:16] let's just stop read innocence pray
[20:18] father we thank you for the reading of
[20:20] your word
[20:21] law me you bless it and sanctify and in
[20:24] Jesus name Amen any man may be seated
[20:29] I'm gonna read this the 23rd verse in
[20:32] 24th verse you can be seated
[20:35] and Jesus also said him unto him if a
[20:40] man love me he will keep my word and my
[20:44] father will love him and we will come
[20:48] unto him and make our abode with him he
[20:52] that loveth me not keeping up my saying
[20:55] in the word what you hear is not mine
[20:58] but the father has sent me amen
[21:03] tonight I want to use for a little fault
[21:08] tonight I'm so reminded of the little
[21:13] thought that our brother Caleb had share
[21:16] with us a couple of weeks ago and it
[21:18] keeps ringing you know in my heart in my
[21:22] mind and I believe that each and every
[21:25] one of us I believe that when we hear
[21:29] you know the Word of God and I believe
[21:32] so many times that we we take it for
[21:35] granted what we hear but when it's
[21:38] something in it that seems to our
[21:41] awakening you and you know that we need
[21:45] certain things especially now it changes
[21:49] it more than just words off of a book or
[21:53] more than just saying that we hear it
[21:56] becomes reality and I think that's what
[22:00] we need more than anything we will come
[22:04] to church and we heard singing and we
[22:08] heard good preaching but we need reality
[22:11] now see just hearing something and
[22:15] feeling good and shouting and
[22:19] it is alright but we need a reality of
[22:22] what we hear we need a living guard down
[22:25] and just hearing sermons oh it's alright
[22:29] but if that servant don't come off the
[22:32] painted of the book and it don't
[22:34] quicking something in you and and cause
[22:37] you to draw closer to God then what good
[22:40] is the sermon oh yeah I'm gonna courage
[22:45] tonight and I want to encourage you
[22:48] tonight search I want you to be
[22:51] encouraged that our God the night I want
[22:54] to talk about your comforter and I
[22:58] believe we all know that we need a
[23:00] comforter the whole world I believe is
[23:04] realizing that it just isn't medicine
[23:08] but we need something that going to give
[23:11] us peace something that's going to keep
[23:15] us in the middle of a crisis or in the
[23:18] middle of your storm in the middle of
[23:21] there's a star we need a real comforter
[23:25] yes I minded that you know people use a
[23:32] lot of things for comfort them sometimes
[23:37] you know whether you're married or the
[23:39] husband become a comfortable wife and
[23:42] wife be a comfort to the husband and the
[23:45] children look to the parents for
[23:48] protection but oh now you need more than
[23:52] action you need something that's really
[23:55] gonna instill and stabilize you they
[23:59] give you an assurance that I need God
[24:04] yeah it's all right
[24:06] your depend on your wife and it's okay
[24:09] to depend on your parents but let me
[24:12] tell you something sometimes they can't
[24:14] even do what you need done and you're
[24:17] gonna need something that our letter is
[24:20] real a man not just our good little
[24:23] sayings are a good little words but
[24:26] you're gonna need a power something that
[24:29] is able
[24:30] whole you even when you don't want to
[24:33] hold yourself you need a comforter and I
[24:38] believe that's what God wants to do for
[24:40] us you know we we lean on people in and
[24:46] it's like that's all right in a sense
[24:48] and we have confidence in this women and
[24:51] all of this but let me tell you now we
[24:55] realize that it has to be something else
[24:58] now different than that I realize that
[25:02] and you realize to dad we can't even
[25:05] keep our own self it man our body get
[25:09] weakened all of us get sick from time to
[25:13] time and sometimes nobody really
[25:16] understand what's going on in your life
[25:19] but I'm so glad that God gave us a
[25:22] comforter he understands what's going on
[25:27] when when nobody else is around late at
[25:30] night and in the midnight hour one you
[25:33] seem to be your back against the wall
[25:36] and pressure from area Avenue becomes
[25:40] the attack your mind and you can just
[25:43] say all Jesus help me Lord and God
[25:47] promised to help us in a time of trouble
[25:52] comforter me I looked up the word
[25:55] comfort it means someone who helps you
[26:02] feel less worried unless upset and
[26:08] frightened and I believe that's what we
[26:13] need tonight we need us somebody to take
[26:16] away over the were in and fear because
[26:20] fear has torment but God want to give
[26:25] you peace he wants you to recognize that
[26:28] in a missile all going on I'm right here
[26:33] all you got to do is call on Jesus and
[26:37] he'll come to your rescue no matter what
[26:40] you're done I watch to going through he
[26:43] is a comfort really you know I'm glad to
[26:49] know tonight and I hope that all you can
[26:53] share it was me also a man that God a
[26:58] man has given you something not that
[27:01] you're boasting that you so big and you
[27:05] so strong no but it's God grace that's
[27:09] what we need or God is our that we need
[27:14] God grace is now or no need to look
[27:19] around friend don't get your eyes off
[27:22] the church off the good preacher look to
[27:25] the hills tonight that's where your help
[27:28] coming from really I feel real good
[27:35] tonight uh just looking and expecting
[27:39] even in the middle so what's going on I
[27:42] know that the life that I'm living now
[27:46] it's not because of me I'm not
[27:49] protecting myself
[27:50] I need a protector you need a protector
[27:54] the world need a protector
[27:56] we are ought to be calling old God Lord
[27:59] come see about us remember the sermon
[28:05] the pastor the preacher and he said
[28:07] return oh man I think that's what God
[28:11] want us to do I'm just wondering you
[28:14] know if we can just get back to God
[28:18] I mean really get back to God not not
[28:22] just Church and not just fall but let's
[28:25] really get back to God listen get call
[28:29] on God until he come and he wants to
[28:32] come by I believe you by saying if you
[28:35] draw nigh to him he'll draw nigh to you
[28:43] you know in prophesied that be st. John
[28:47] said this he said let not your heart be
[28:51] troubled
[28:52] come on about us Amen horse or failing
[28:56] for fear but God said don't let your
[29:00] heart be troubled
[29:02] why have you believed in me see he want
[29:07] us to trust him amen and we begin to
[29:10] trust God more than our jobs and more
[29:13] than our money and more than your
[29:16] success of this world are your earthly
[29:20] possession but trust him oh my I'm
[29:27] telling you just something you know that
[29:30] I was just looking at the comforter
[29:34] someone who helps you feel less worried
[29:40] and I know that there's a lot on people
[29:44] minds and and they are wondering you
[29:48] know what's gonna happen next so how I'm
[29:52] gonna come out of it and they're
[29:54] wondering you know what can I do to
[29:57] protect myself
[29:59] what do to reinsure that I won't get the
[30:04] virus with all Church I want to tell you
[30:08] tonight trust in the Lord with all thy
[30:12] might and rizal in that heart lean not
[30:15] water and understanding also in the book
[30:19] of Timothy it was saying that you know
[30:22] that how perilous times is going to come
[30:28] you know what I was thinking about the
[30:30] Bible as being one of the only books
[30:33] that can tell us the past in the future
[30:38] amen it can let us know what's going on
[30:43] in the world and why is all this
[30:46] following us but so many times we don't
[30:51] take the right heed to the word we look
[30:56] at as a being just old book that was
[30:59] written thousands of years ago and we
[31:03] failed to get the very
[31:07] tears of what the Word of God wills to
[31:10] do for us but when you look at the
[31:13] Baba's being a book of reality a book of
[31:17] prophecy and looking at you know the
[31:20] condition of the world and how the world
[31:22] is reacting and where we are going in by
[31:26] now I know that we heard it from years
[31:29] and years ago you know that the world is
[31:33] good ready to go it's coming to an end
[31:37] and we begin to see the signs at a time
[31:41] we begin to see the Matthew 24 and 7 how
[31:45] the Bible predict it man earthquakes and
[31:48] Kingdom against Kingdom and pestilence
[31:51] and all these they did about say these
[31:54] are only the beginning of Sorrows and
[31:59] that's what I thought about what brother
[32:00] kayla has shared if this is just the
[32:03] beginning what are we ought to be doing
[32:06] oh my look is just the beginning we
[32:10] can't hardly take it Lord to help us to
[32:13] get or something that would be able to
[32:15] keep us for whatever get rid of that
[32:18] happen next knows we need it I believe
[32:24] it's time that we ought to be really
[32:26] preparing ourselves
[32:29] don't take the things lightly let's take
[32:34] it seriously who knows what is gonna
[32:39] happen next and that's why he said let
[32:43] not your heart be troubled
[32:46] coz of you believe in me see it's
[32:49] important that we really believe in God
[32:54] in His Word amen oh want to just look at
[33:01] one little phrase here that I really one
[33:05] of the way lon in that 16th verse it
[33:09] says 14 14 he is saying and I will pray
[33:12] the father and he shall give you another
[33:15] comforter that he may abide with you
[33:21] forever and I like that something that I
[33:26] never leave you you know we leave a lot
[33:30] of things you know but god this
[33:33] comforter that he's talking about he
[33:35] wants to give you that it abide with you
[33:39] for ever when you don't even feel like
[33:43] you deserted he's still there I mean
[33:47] when everything else seems to for sukur
[33:51] and everybody else seemed to don't have
[33:53] nothing to do with you Jesus saying I'll
[33:57] be right there
[33:58] amen when you need a friend and you
[34:01] don't have a friend he'll be a friend
[34:03] with a little duckling in the dolls
[34:07] maiden that all he could do and he
[34:10] walked away shake his head then jesus
[34:13] said I'm the real doctor and I can heal
[34:17] all of your disease when I look at that
[34:22] when I look at doctor Jesus he got a
[34:26] proven record you know in his racket he
[34:31] never lost the case you know it is good
[34:36] to have good doctors and if you need a
[34:38] good doctor you were trying to find the
[34:40] best one you can because of his proven
[34:44] record a man his luck is sure that he's
[34:48] been very successful and the surgery
[34:51] that he does has been very you know a
[34:55] very technique and he do what he needs
[34:59] to do in his rating is high they have
[35:02] ratings you know but Jesus got a higher
[35:06] rating
[35:07] he specializes eat everything and there
[35:12] was nothing the Bible said there is
[35:15] nothing impossible with God and then
[35:19] I'll be the scriptures say one place is
[35:21] there no bar meaning Gideon is there no
[35:25] physician here he said it why
[35:28] they're the daughters of my people not
[35:30] healed
[35:31] Oh God is the healer he's the Great
[35:36] Physician yeah yeah bad with you forever
[35:41] I like that he just don't come when you
[35:44] come to church and leave you know one
[35:47] Tuesday or Wednesday and take a break no
[35:50] he dare when you're when you leave and
[35:52] when you come he's even there in your
[35:54] sleep amen and you know I mean sometime
[35:58] how we fight things in our sleep you
[36:00] know we were wrestle some time and and
[36:03] can't really arrest but all and you can
[36:06] get the comforter or the comforter can
[36:10] give you peace when you can't even sleep
[36:13] he's right there to ease all of us
[36:16] crests because people are stressful then
[36:21] so stressful they have to rely upon
[36:23] peels and rely upon all type of
[36:27] medication because nothing seems some
[36:31] time to even work sometimes even the
[36:34] medication be too strong or too weak and
[36:37] have a lot of side effects and it makes
[36:41] you feel worse in one area and good in
[36:43] another but if the comforter can ever
[36:47] abide and come in your heart oh he'll
[36:51] give you peace tonight I'll remind me of
[36:55] you turn a little bit quickly st. John
[37:01] still still talking about the comforter
[37:05] I hope tonight and pray that you will
[37:10] try this comforter and let him come into
[37:14] you tonight just don't go to church and
[37:18] just read a word but let the comforter
[37:21] come in a body see that comforter want
[37:25] to stay but you got to open up your
[37:28] heart and say Lord fill me give me this
[37:33] comforter like that woman is that the
[37:36] well that time she had tried a lot of
[37:39] things to comfort us
[37:42] and tried man you know the different
[37:44] feel how voting how hard and she met
[37:48] Jesus one day at that well it managed
[37:52] you'll be getting to talk to and find
[37:54] out will help problems at and and she
[37:57] been telling me he said you know go get
[37:59] your hug because she's I don't have no
[38:01] she see you said it right you had five
[38:04] and the one you with in none of you see
[38:06] she was looking for some type of
[38:09] confident she thought it was in a man
[38:12] but until she met the real man I believe
[38:16] that is the problem of people that when
[38:19] they go to church it's alright to go to
[38:21] church but you need to go to meet Jesus
[38:25] don't leave church every without meeting
[38:28] the person of Jesus Christ and invite
[38:31] him into your heart and let him take
[38:34] control or he want to control you not
[38:38] you can show him the problem a lot of
[38:42] times we we try to control God and God
[38:46] said no I'm the one need to be in
[38:48] control just move out of the way and let
[38:51] me come in have preeminence and that's
[38:54] what God trying to get us to let me have
[38:58] control of your life let let me come in
[39:01] and abide with you let let me just have
[39:04] all of your burdens and all of your
[39:07] cares come on I've been paid the price
[39:10] for it already
[39:11] just surrender your life to me and let
[39:14] me handle it what a comforter what a
[39:20] comfort especially the time like this
[39:24] amen we need a real comfort yeah we're
[39:28] saying in st. John's 16 I'll be coming
[39:33] to closing Saint John 16 I believe it's
[39:38] the seventh verse he said nevertheless
[39:43] I'll tell you the truth it is expedient
[39:47] for you that I go away if I go not away
[39:52] the comforter will
[39:55] not coming to you but if I depart I will
[39:59] sing him on to you
[40:03] you see God making it president he want
[40:06] the center comforter to you it's a
[40:12] personal invitation that God are you
[40:17] know won't Stu send a comforter but you
[40:22] have to let the comfort to come in so
[40:26] when he has come he will reprove the
[40:30] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[40:34] judgment a sin because they believe on
[40:38] me or a righteous because I go to my
[40:41] father and you see me no more see see he
[40:46] said one place that the world don't see
[40:50] me but you will see me see the world
[40:53] can't understand who this comforter is
[40:58] they think a lot of times that you know
[41:03] that they know how to comfort themselves
[41:05] through a substitution sometimes they
[41:09] try drugs and try all kind of forms to
[41:13] ease the mind to get some kind of
[41:16] relaxation and big release them from are
[41:20] always going on but oh that won't give
[41:24] you the right conflict you have to wake
[41:27] up and do the same thing the next day
[41:28] but if you ever let this real comfort to
[41:34] come in church I promise you and hereby
[41:38] there even in a missile crisis he'll
[41:43] give you peace god bless you tonight
[41:46] hope that era is something insane a man
[41:49] to be a blessing to you you see our past

[42:41] all these uncertain sounds there is a
[42:45] certain sound the Jesus Christ is the
[42:49] same yesterday and today and forever he
