know um there was a scripture and I I found this to be my testimony um Psalms 34 and one I Will Bless The Lord at all times and and his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord that's the only one I want to boast in it's in the Lord for there is none good except for one amen but the humble shall hear thereof and be glad say this with me oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears amen they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear Him and deliver them oh taste and see that the Lord he is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him amen you know just as an honor to be here this morning with my family my mom dad they traveled long miles with all the 13 others if I counted right 12 they're here from Arizona and uh they come to sit and worship with you and then I have my wife sitting back there and my daughter Jubilee they they finally came with me and we're here but a couple months ago um brother Henry and I had lost contact um I had just preached here on a Sunday morning Tuesday night Wednesday it was a Wednesday we had an actor shooter situation and I kind of went off the grid and I'd like to tell you a little bit of that testimony on how the Lord was a protector July 24th um about 1:30 in the afternoon it was noon actually when the homeowner came out and talked with us and told us a sob story told us that he lost his job and I offered him another job told him I could help him and tried to help him out he said well I might do that and he went in the house and we had ate a sandwich together he came back out an hour later with a rifle and so now I was like well something's changed I don't know what happened but I see him raise the rifle at me and I said guys run he has a gun and I shoved one of the guys and next I know there was three rounds that went off striking two of my guys they were hit in the face and one in the throat fortunately it was just a 22 but we had to run to safety and um we hid for about an hour and a half away from a shootter law enforcement wouldn't go up there they were kind of held back until backup would arrive and we had no idea where the shooter was because it's small caliber rifle no one knew where he went and all we heard is reports of people getting shot at and people getting shot and by God's grace there was only three people that were shot through the whole thing everybody survived and you know Dustin the one that was shot in the throat he was in the hospital for about 3 and a half months um on a ventilator doctors at first didn't expecting to uh survive they um they said well if he makes it out of this it's going to be a miracle I went in the hospital room with Dustin and I stood next to him and Dustin looked sent me can't speak and he says pray I said I will he said no now I need you to pray now I grabbed his hand my boss walked in the room and I took his hand and I started to pray as only I knew how I watched the Lord Lord just come and bring more strength to him Dustin's walking right now he's talking it's not what I can do my Bible told me lay my hands on the sick and they shall recover it's not just for the preacher if you believe the word amen you can do it to am yes Dustin right now he he's not able to work he doesn't need to work he got a big settlement but his strength is slowly coming back he's slowly being able to talk more he starts to wear a neck brace because his muscles the bullet got lodged in his vertebrae and he he isn't able to really lift his head and put it down as we can Salvador the other one that was shot in the face he said the doctor told me that it was a miracle that and he said God is real and I said how'd the bullet strike you he said when I was facing this way my side profile the bullet came in and went in his face right here and ricocheted off his cheekbone and went out his nose he said the doctor they've had many 22 bullet patients come in and most of them have been fatal they said because the bullet from a 22 if anyone knows the trajectory of a weapon of of uh bullets they 22 will actually Ricochet off the bones in your body they'll Ricochet off the vertebraes they ricet off everything the muscles they it's just a small caliber bullet and that bullet the doctor said if it wasn't for the grace of God you wouldn't be here today cuz that bullet from the direction it went in should have went rade off the bone up to your brain but he said it went out your nose he said the only explanation I know is that God was in the midst now before before this would even happen um we had been talking about the Lord before the shooting ever even happened and I I I never really recalled that until afterwards that we were over here actually sitting and talking about the word and we took about 5 minutes after we cleared this road out and we took those 5 minutes to talk and drink drink of water we started talking about the Lord and that's when I seen the shooter come out I said guys he has a gun run the only explanation I know is that he was in the midst the prophet of God would tell us that when we would talk about the Lord he comes near and that's the only explanation I know but the whole time that I was in that middle of that uh situation when an enemy was coming in like a flood there was only some things that I had on my mind was I need to get home and see my family that one that sang dad dad back there I wanted to see her that's the only one I could think about is Jubilee and Rachel There Was You Know Not Another care in my in my mind is I wanted to go be able to be with them but I just want to give all the grace and all the honor and all the praise to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for he alone is worthy amen amen maybe if the

ahead the church is out of order the family is out of order amen the world itself look like it's out of order amen things have to get in order for God God to have the preeminence amen when things are out of order it's somewhat chaotic amen amen but we understand that we're living in our age we call lay out a seal but we know the bride is in the bride age but we're living in a time where men have no respect of in of authority yes sir children don't have no respect I said the school can you shake somebody hand telling the school they out of order children are out of order are you it's chaotic in school yes sir you go to Schoolhouse and the teachers have no control because there's no what no order no respect how many of you ever visit the schoolhouse sure I said go to the go to the schoolhouse you can go to elementary school if you want a kindergarten he said as were my people children are the oppressors and R rule over them oh my people they which lead thee cause the to arror and destroy the way of your path you talking about a little child should lead them oh yes the things are so instead of the parents being the one that uh a setting example are telling the children what to do the the parent the child what you want to do the the parent they tell them what they want to eat what they don't want to eat tell them what kind of clothes they want to wear what they don't want to wear come on I want me a $500 P sneakers cuz the other children in school got some come on so even if you have to go get a counterfeit one they look like it see uh the children are dictating to the parents the Bible say children obey for this is right am ain't that right but children the children said parents obey your children everything is true turn upside down say God is the head of the church but it seem like the church is the head of god wow it's out of order isn't that right uh so this morning I'm talking about restoring order amen amen amen let's restore the order back amen come on if you want to see God move and you want to see the anointing restore order am amen you tell the children what you want them to do and they tell you what they going to do are you with me and the said okay baby yes honey child is that teaching them anything amen and you wonder why the church is out of order cuz the house is out of order sometime we don't allow amen the man to be the head cuz the woman won't allow him are you with me see people are not subject to the word wow and when you give the people the word they don't want the word so the head can never come to the body because they're not [Music] together when the head comes to the body amen the body got to be right because God is not going to be unequally yolked together wow with a dominating female come on a church that want a Domin over the word are you with me amen if you want to do your own [Applause] thing and not be subject to the word then get another Bible amen are you with me amen but if you believe that the [Applause] word was with God and the Word was God Amen yes and the God is amen you must amen let him be Lord ruler over you amen you don't tell the word what to do the word tell you what to do amen are you with me amen but the Bible says we workers together with him amen we ought to work together with him amen amen amen the husband and the wife should be one amen so so if you one you got no problem amen are you with me the problem is there is division in God's house amen because there's a Visions in the home when you go home there's a vision amen amen God can never come down and have preeminence in uh th Tyra because Jezebel was a dominating f male are you with me she dominated AAL and the spirit of Jezebel has come in this leot ofy of age the church want to dominate over the word amen are you with me so we must become subject to him who is our head for Christ is the head of the church church amen and he wants the preeminence over the body am amen somebody said where he leads is that right the Bible say they that are led by the spirit of God they are on now are you with me amen so you must allow Jesus to lead you amen you know we say I do what I feel like doing you're not living by amen what you feel the just shall live by the restored order amen is identifying the restitution of all things as the Seed of Abraham amen and the Bible calls us Seed of Abraham we're children of God by faith in Christ Jesus amen are you with me amen not outside but inside amen I said Eve was in Adam and Adam and Eve was one amen as long as Eve stayed in Adam she could not sin am yes but being a byproduct praise God she got out of order that's why he said Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression oh don't you picking on women you got to stop it what do they call them male shinness or whatever I don't know what they call it you talking about the church now y get they get spiritual minded amen y'all sister get get spiritual amen we talking about the church get in the spirit amen don't get don't get offended please amen but the natural types of spiritual are you with me so when we find ourselves amen not being subject to the word then that is the spirit of the Antichrist which is against the word are you with me amen and we know that that spirit amen was just the spirit of the nickol and became a deed and becomes a Doctrine and then it ends up being a union taking on incarnate itself in a man are you with me amen so we understand that the order amen there's a spirit that's leading the false Vine and the True Vine amen amen so there a spirit that the world Amen is being led by I never seen Christians get so in politics believe in the LI all politics is of the devil and being led by the devil amen Republican Democrats and whoever don't even get caught up in that mess all of is of the devil I'm a Dem I'm not all of is of the devil don't even talk about how talk about your your kingdom my kingdom is not of this world are

amen amen restoring order the restitution of all things things must be restored amen it makes people mad because they don't want to be restored they want to stay out of order and do their own thing and say I know God for myself yeah I know woo Lord have mercy some mean people in this world ain't it y'all ever seen a mean person Oho Lord they don't mind giving you a piece of it what that's all they got is a piece too I'll give you a piece of my mind I know you better keep it that's all you got and there ain't no peace in that he give them perfect peace who's what my daughter would correct with that it ain't the kind of piece you I he now praise God I know that but y'all follow me a okay so by the grace of God I I I got to close CU I just got started y'all all right sir y'all know we in trouble we're in trouble cuz there's no respect I remember one time the military you know those that uh had Authority was in Authority they can they can say certain things and everybody would respect the the the uh the stripes and sergeant and the officers and all now they got to be scared cuz you might make somebody nervous you might make somebody on the job and supervisor could say things that they got to be politically correct can't say thing no no no no you got to know what the you can say what you can't say you can do and can't do everything is on tents my daughter often times she said Daddy you can't say thing you on the AE praise God see everybody's nervous because everybody's being watched you got to watch what you say you can't offend nobody are you with me we're living in a nervous age where people's nerves they on edge everybody's on edge amen people are nervous amen and all they want all they want you to do is love them when they're right love them when they're wrong love them when they upside down but you love him but love is correction and the correction is to get you back in order whom the Lord loveth he what chasing chasing to get you back in order God must correct you amen and people canot are you with me praise God people as this as the church is so uh out of they can't get on one Accord brother Fred sir it's hard now to get on one Accord in one place and suddenly there come a sound from Heaven to the ran Mighty Wind but people are so far out of it and that's what we we're living in a world that's so far gone that when you speak truth they don't even have a the finest understanding of what truth is are you with me because they have already complicated even the English language amen and he said we need a male nor female neither Bor or free but we all one and they oh Lord they take the scriptures and twist it so bad come on are you with me yeah they make the the English language as though it doesn't exist because it doesn't pertain to the way I say so we interpret the English language with our own twist to it used to be a time when people respected the Bible being the King James virgin but there are so made so many virgins to the people are so confused are you with me at one time we just had one Bible most people looked and read now people have come to church and they got the living Bible the new Bible the oh goodness New World Translation this kind of translation everybody come with a different Bible and then the preacher go to preach he said I'm trying to preach out all 26 or 00 different by the time you get to one scripture it's time for people to go cuz they can't stay for 15 minutes are you with me so we're out of order but the people uh been this out of order so long till you try to get them back in order what they doing they've been out of order so you you try to get things back in order people are upset cuz they've been out of order so long they think H what are you trying to do are you with me you know when people have been bound up so long when you try to get them free from the B you know it somethings like a anim been caged up so long you take the cage and lift it up and the cage is gone the animal still right there running around in that Circle because they think the bars are still there they don't got used to that place often time we get used to where we are that when God takes the amen uh takes the bar away again get it out of out of that bondage we've been Amen in such a mindset for so long to when God comes to free you amen we cannot deal with [Music] freedom are you with me so I I I'm saying this morning be careful that what you accustomed to amen has thrown you so far out of order that God's blessings cannot come upon you and the things that God has for you he cannot give it to you because you are order are you with me so by the grace of God God want to bless the people with abundancy of blessings God want to give you so much joy and so much God wants to explode on the scene give you a double potion of his Spirit but he cannot do it he had to hold it back because things got to be right if you get it you blow up amen because you can't take it are you with me I believe that we're living in this hour where he says he promised to restore all things are you with me and I believe all things have been restored but people don't recognize the restoration of all things are you with me we're in the hour long ago people felt like they were restored they felt good they were shouting they were dancing in the spirit amen it was Revival striking the nation in the world and people were so excited but we got to a point people got plenty money and they forgot God Amen when people didn't have much they serve the Lord people got plenty of money they didn't need the Lord no more they figure what they got God was blessing them and God knew them and they knew God because they were looking at the things they present and that's what people do they look at what they got and they determine God being with them and God blessing them so they measure God by the things that they have are you with me y'all all right amen amen y'all believe things are out of order praise God you think people coming to church because they want to get their life in order or they come to church for entertainment they want a good choir good singing and want preachers to tell them what they want to hear do they want to get right with God are they coming to church because I want to get closer to the Lord I want to get right with God I want me a good preacher and I want me a good musician and good singers and I want to feel good when I go but can you stand a look correction will you allow God to correct you and set your life in order your house in order your children in order would you allow him to do that preacher tend to your own business are you with me T to your business leave mine alone are you with me people tell the teacher teacher they tell the supervisor on the job they don't have to respect the supervisor everything is out of order are you with me ask and don't tell don't ask don't tell all kind of stuff we come up with all kind of remedies to the way we live our lives but let's come down to the point God I want to live for you I want you to be in control of my life amen I want to hear the truth I want to know what truth is then I can make my decision when you tell me the truth but if I don't hear and nobody telling me then I would never know if it hurts me I want you to tell me the truth that's amen it hurts sometime for parents to have to tell their children the truth how many of you parents have have gotten hurt because you got to tell them the truth and hurt you worse than it hurt your children how many of you have faced it that how many parents can say that y'all parent y'all just Ain tell your children the truth sometime I got tears in my eyes boy don't you do that you know crying are you with me cuz you're trying to tell them what's going to what's going to happen up ahead that they making the wrong decision wrong choices it hurt you bad to your heart amen are you with me y'all understand but sometimes the children say I got to find out W be that parent that won't tell them then they find out and they said Mama daddy why didn't you tell me why didn't you tell me what that preacher that would not tell the people the truth whoa Amen to that friend but because they wanted to keep your friendship wouldn't tell you the truth that's why we're in such a bad shape yes sir Truth Hurts sometime but you got to tell the
