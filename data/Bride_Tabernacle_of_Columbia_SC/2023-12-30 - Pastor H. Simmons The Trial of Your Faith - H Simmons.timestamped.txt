[33:07] ready to be revealed in the last time
[33:11] when you greatly Rejoice though now for
[33:16] a season if need be ye are in heaveness
[33:21] through manifold Temptation that the
[33:24] trial of your faith be much more
[33:27] precious than of gold that
[33:31] perish though it be tried with
[33:35] fire might be found into praise and
[33:39] honor and Glory at the appearance of
[33:43] Jesus Christ God bless your this word
[33:45] you may be
[33:48] seated we want talk about the trial the
[33:53] trial of your
[33:55] faith praise God
[33:59] you know I was just
[34:02] thinking about this chapter and I was
[34:05] reading and and I said you
[34:07] know I wonder when Peter was writing
[34:11] this these gracious words to the saints
[34:15] of God to encourage them and to admonish
[34:18] them and tell them that you you you the
[34:23] testing of your faith the trial of your
[34:26] faith
[34:29] you it's more precious than
[34:32] gold and
[34:35] uh though it be tried with
[34:38] fire you going to go through some
[34:42] things but it was so many gracious words
[34:48] that he was saying to them to encourage
[34:52] them he he said elect
[34:55] according
[34:57] amen until the full knowledge of God so
[35:01] I'm speaking to you and putting you in
[35:05] your
[35:06] position that you understand who you
[35:10] are amen so when I talk about the trial
[35:14] of your
[35:15] faith amen the testes that we're going
[35:18] to go through or that we are going
[35:22] to and I thought about these words that
[35:26] were put to pen back then and I thought
[35:31] about how the message of the hour
[35:33] restores us back to the faith of the
[35:35] apostolic
[35:38] fathers
[35:40] that the faith your
[35:44] faith that has been
[35:48] restored
[35:50] amen you and
[35:54] I understand that the trial of our
[36:00] faith
[36:02] amen he said the trial in the seventh
[36:05] verse that the trial of your faith being
[36:09] much more what precious precious then
[36:13] go praise God what you going through
[36:16] present
[36:19] tense what as a Christian as a
[36:25] Believer as fellow fellow citizens of
[36:29] the
[36:31] Kingdom amen I want you to understand
[36:34] that God is you know uh uh saying that
[36:39] the trial of your faith that you can
[36:41] hold
[36:44] on I want you to hold on and I want you
[36:48] to understand that what you going
[36:52] through praise
[36:55] God
[36:57] is
[36:59] precious as a Believer as one that
[37:03] holding
[37:04] to the word that God has given us in
[37:07] this
[37:08] hour this end
[37:11] time it's more precious than
[37:16] gold but see sometimes folks don't
[37:20] understand the why they being tested or
[37:22] why they being
[37:24] tried amen how precious is it is and
[37:28] then what happens when you're tested
[37:30] once you're
[37:32] tried gold
[37:36] perishes though it be tried with fire it
[37:40] might be found unto the
[37:42] praise and
[37:44] honor amen we saw uh those Believers in
[37:49] the old test men and the Believers in
[37:52] the early church and what they went
[37:55] through you know you know how the women
[37:58] were uh children were ripped out of the
[38:00] stomach to
[38:02] cut John hust say went and they burnt
[38:06] him at the
[38:08] state and different Believers amen they
[38:11] had to go through things because their
[38:14] faith was
[38:15] tried but what happened they held on
[38:20] stepen was stoned to
[38:22] death and he looked into heaven he said
[38:25] I see Jesus at the right hand of
[38:28] God he said don't lay this on their
[38:32] charge amen why because it's what oh
[38:37] what happens amen a Believer amen When
[38:42] Trials and test has come then we must
[38:44] embrace
[38:46] them we must welcome it so Lord thank
[38:50] you for counting me worthy yes to suffer
[38:55] for your name yes
[38:58] amen and that's what happens uh amen the
[39:01] apostles when they beat him and throw
[39:03] him in jail they were singing Paul
[39:05] inside of

[1:24:16] illness or what have you um in my body
[1:24:19] and they don't exactly know what it is
[1:24:21] but I did have to go um to urgent care
[1:24:24] today but um in my right hand um it just
[1:24:29] was getting progressively worse where I
[1:24:31] didn't have a lot of movement in it in
[1:24:33] the wrist and it was painful so I said
[1:24:36] you know I'm just going to go to urgent
[1:24:37] care you know get some prednizone or
[1:24:40] whatever but anyway the doctors want me
[1:24:43] to go to a
[1:24:44] rheumatologist next month and I really
[1:24:48] hadn't been talking about it because I'm
[1:24:50] you know I've already claimed my healing
[1:24:52] and I was telling somebody else you know
[1:24:54] things get worse a lot of times before
[1:24:56] they get better in your healing so I
[1:24:58] don't want to look at the symptoms or
[1:25:01] anything so I am claiming my healing I
[1:25:03] am going to go to the doctor though um
[1:25:05] in January I'm I'm going to go through
[1:25:07] with it um but I just want to thank the
[1:25:09] Lord for that but I did have something
[1:25:12] on my heart and I know we may take
[1:25:15] communion you know New Year's Eve and I
[1:25:17] said I want to get this off of me before

[1:25:31] it was one day that she said they're
[1:25:32] having a game night and I'm not
[1:25:36] invited I said well I mean it's not the
[1:25:38] first time I've heard that Hannah you
[1:25:40] know it's okay and she said I just don't
[1:25:43] see why I can't go why am I not old

[1:25:48] was a
[1:25:49] joke I said I don't know I don't I don't
[1:25:52] know but the thing is it bothered me it
[1:25:55] bothered me um and I talked to Maya
[1:25:58] about it and I talked to one of my
[1:26:00] friends about it I said well you know
[1:26:01] what I got to get this off of me it's
[1:26:04] not geared my frustration it's not
[1:26:07] geared to
[1:26:09] anyone
[1:26:11] specifically but I just feel some type
[1:26:14] of way and I'm just being honest I feel
[1:26:17] some type of way about it um so I wanted
[1:26:21] to get get that off of me cuz I don't
[1:26:23] want to take it into
[1:26:26] 2024 so you know I just wanted to say
[1:26:29] that but I love
[1:26:31] everybody but that just has really been
[1:26:34] bothering me so that's all I want to say

[1:26:58] been going through this year

[1:27:18] anybody to feel uncomfortable we were
[1:27:20] planning to have a little game night for
[1:27:22] the kids but we hadn't come up with
[1:27:24] every with the whole thing yet but we
[1:27:26] were going to plan to do that and we did
[1:27:29] not I feel bad for if anybody felt
[1:27:33] excluded but there was an age limit this
[1:27:36] year due to certain people being invited
[1:27:38] and we just didn't want anything to
[1:27:40] happen but NE going on next year we will
[1:27:45] open up the age womit from other
[1:27:47] people that was
