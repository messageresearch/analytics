[43:06] which i do
[43:08] 18.
[43:17] for i knew him that he will command his
[43:21] children and his household after him
[43:24] and they shall keep the weight of the
[43:27] lord to do justice and judgment that the
[43:31] lord may bring upon abraham that which
[43:35] he has spoken of him 20.
[43:49] i will go down now and see
[43:52] whether they have done altogether
[43:54] according to the cry of it which is come

[44:14] near and said will thou also destroy the
[44:18] righteous with the wicked 24.
[44:31] that
[44:32] before form thee to do after this manner
[44:37] to slay the righteous with the wicked
[44:40] and that the righteous should be
[44:42] as a wicked
[44:44] that he be far from thee
[44:47] shall not the judge of all the earth you
[44:50] write 26.
[45:00] and abraham answered and said behold now
[45:04] i have taken upon me to speak unto the
[45:08] lord which
[45:09] am but
[45:10] dust and ashes 28.
[45:26] and he spoke unto him yet again and said
[45:30] prevention there shall be 40
[45:33] found there

[48:35] psychic world
[48:37] and they're trying to get spirit guides
[48:39] to come down and tell them give them
[48:40] answers because people are baffled
[48:43] they're going through mentally they're

[48:47] through all kind of goings because they
[48:49] want to find out what is going on with

[48:55] something is happening and we want to
[48:57] know the unknown we want to know what's
[48:59] what's my future so people are calling
[49:02] these people and they're they're they're
[49:04] reaching out to people that they think
[49:06] that are spiritual people and they're
[49:08] trying to get access for the future so
[49:11] more than ever the people that go to
[49:12] church believe in god they're saying
[49:15] well i can't go

[49:24] a lot of people are turning to
[49:26] witchcraft and witches and they'll turn
[49:28] into

[49:53] reach back and trying to find themselves
[49:56] and find answers and they don't know
[49:57] what they're looking for but yet they
[50:00] know that what they have they're not
[50:02] satisfied with it
[50:04] but i'm saying amen it's because people
[50:06] are not satisfied but
[50:08] i'm determined that god is the same
[50:11] amen god is the same amen
[50:14] praise god instead of lining up with the
[50:17] word of god and getting right with god
[50:19] where god can answer and oh no they
[50:22] don't want to do that
[50:25] they may they want to know the future
[50:27] amen but they don't believe that god got
[50:29] the future in control
[50:32] and god knows your future if you want to
[50:35] know oh lord
[50:37] hallelujah
[50:39] so here
[50:40] this morning we looked at
[50:43] abraham the three angels coming down

[50:50] and god amen the lord
[50:53] amen began to say shall i hide amen from
[50:56] abraham the thing that i'm getting ready
[50:58] to do
[51:00] i said the future amen was going to be
[51:03] revealed to abraham
[51:06] amen as the future home is revealed to
[51:09] the bride of jesus christ god reveals
[51:12] the future to you and i
[51:15] it meant god said shall i hide from
[51:17] abraham the bible said surely amos 3 7
[51:20] says surely the lord god will do nothing
[51:22] but he reveals his secrets to his
[51:24] servant the prophet
[51:26] praise god amen before god does anything
[51:29] major god got an egypt on the earth he
[51:32] meant to reveal warning before
[51:34] judgment are you with me

[51:39] standing today amen we should not stand
[51:42] in awe amen like we don't have an answer
[51:45] to the problem
[51:47] amen but jesus is the answer
[51:50] the word of god has our answer to what's
[51:54] going on now
[51:56] but
[51:58] do we really want answers
[52:01] see sometimes we want to
[52:03] just something to soothe our conscience
[52:07] something to us
[52:09] stabilize our lives a little bit
[52:12] something that we can rest contented
[52:15] even though it might be a lie
[52:18] amen but it makes us feel good and feel
[52:22] secured even if you give me a lie amen
[52:26] make me feel good
[52:29] comfort me amen
[52:31] praise god so a lot of folks are
[52:33] reaching out for comfort
[52:35] but here in the book of genesis
[52:39] uh 41 genesis 41
[52:44] i don't know about you but god reveals
[52:46] himself through dreams and
[52:48] and uh and sometimes
[52:50] uh god be
[52:52] trying to shake us up and and i feel
[52:55] like some of us have been
[52:57] dreaming dreams and god has been
[53:00] speaking to you in dreams but yet you're
[53:02] not listening to the voice of god but
[53:05] sometimes god won't shake you amen
[53:08] long enough amen that you need to listen
[53:11] to me
[53:13] you need to hear what i'm telling you
[53:16] praise god god is saying everywhere you
[53:18] turn listen i'm trying to tell you
[53:21] something amen can't you hear god's
[53:24] voice speaking to you
[53:26] but look amen
[53:29] now as people are inquisitive and
[53:31] they're searching
[53:32] for what's on the horizon for what's
[53:35] going to happen in 2022 amen
[53:39] i believe we're into very we're into
[53:43] some surprises so amen surprise after

[54:54] and he and he he said god will you
[54:56] destroy the righteous with it be it far

[55:52] our actions speak louder than our words
[55:54] it doesn't matter how loud amen we speak
[55:57] and how loud we cry
[55:59] but can we match it with our action
[56:02] amen so

[1:10:31] and behold there come seven years of
[1:10:33] great plenty throughout all the land of
[1:10:35] egypt
[1:10:37] go ahead and there shall arise after
[1:10:39] them seven years of famine and all the
[1:10:42] plenty shall be forgotten in the land of
[1:10:44] egypt and the famous shall consume the
[1:10:46] land
[1:10:47] and the plenty shall not be known in the
[1:10:49] land by reason of that fame and
[1:10:51] following for it shall be very grievous
[1:10:54] and for that the dream was double enough
[1:10:56] to fail pharaoh twice
[1:10:59] it is because the thing is established
[1:11:01] by god and god will shortly bring it to
[1:11:03] pass

[1:11:07] a man discreet and wise and set him over

[1:11:49] he's showing us
[1:11:51] for a reason
[1:11:52] for you to prepare yourself
[1:11:55] are you with me
[1:11:57] all this shaking and all of this that's
[1:11:59] happening
[1:12:00] is for a reason
[1:12:02] for god to get your attention
[1:12:04] so you prepare yourself
[1:12:08] now remember
[1:12:10] while all this are happening
[1:12:13] every
[1:12:14] even
[1:12:17] the all the witch doctors and all the
[1:12:19] wise and all the protect
[1:12:21] prognosticators and all of those people
[1:12:24] who wise people and all the scientific
[1:12:26] world and all the church worlds they
[1:12:29] don't know what's going on
[1:12:31] but
[1:12:32] they can't interpret what's going on
[1:12:35] they're looking at it
[1:12:37] global warming they're saying
[1:12:39] this is going to happen that's going to
[1:12:41] happen
[1:12:42] brothers and sisters but you and i
[1:12:43] understand what's going to happen
[1:12:46] brothers and sisters and that's what it
[1:12:48] is if we truly understand what's going
[1:12:51] to happen and why these things are
[1:12:54] coming
[1:12:55] like they're coming
[1:12:57] if we don't then we're going to have to
[1:12:59] ask god
[1:13:00] amen we're going to have to search
[1:13:03] god
[1:13:04] search the scriptures
[1:13:06] back to the word
[1:13:08] brother and sister back to god
[1:13:11] and i i believe
[1:13:14] let's go back to john
[1:13:17] three
[1:13:18] the book of jonah
[1:13:20] three
[1:13:22] i
[1:13:22] i believe that
[1:13:24] as i said
[1:13:26] the other night
[1:13:28] bringing in the new year
[1:13:30] i'll wake up and call on god
[1:13:34] are you all whippy
[1:13:37] because
[1:13:39] the time is late the hour is late
[1:13:43] now i was late
[1:13:46] people the bible says before it's coming
[1:13:49] there'll be a great fall in the way
[1:13:56] i believe
[1:13:58] the pandemic has helped
[1:14:00] the great fallen away
[1:14:04] people have
[1:14:07] lukewarm
[1:14:10] not hot not cold
[1:14:15] sometimes i glance at what the religious
[1:14:18] world is doing
[1:14:20] they are bringing the nightclub
[1:14:22] atmosphere into the church
[1:14:25] the lights
[1:14:29] the dancing they're giving the people
[1:14:31] entertainment
[1:14:33] so people are going to a church that
[1:14:35] would entertain them
[1:14:37] and they can dance and get their groove
[1:14:39] on
[1:14:44] they they're really
[1:14:46] the young people are excited and some of
[1:14:49] the old people older people
[1:14:52] they just
[1:14:54] instead of
[1:14:55] spontaneous praise
[1:14:58] and dancing in the spirit by the unction
[1:15:01] of the holy ghost and the spontaneous
[1:15:03] worship
[1:15:05] they learning how to dance
[1:15:07] spiritual dance praise dances and all of
[1:15:10] that
[1:15:13] the movement is
[1:15:16] people got to rock and roll in the
[1:15:18] church
[1:15:19] the holy ghost can't have the
[1:15:21] preeminence
[1:15:23] brother and sister but the people want
[1:15:25] more of that
[1:15:26] and they want less of god
[1:15:29] and more of the world
[1:15:31] are you with me
[1:15:33] so the people are going to go to a
[1:15:36] church
[1:15:37] that can entertain them the best
[1:15:40] and that they're getting their money
[1:15:42] worth
[1:15:44] are you will be
[1:15:47] and so they could
[1:15:50] get
[1:15:51] under a false delusion and not even know
[1:15:54] that they're getting locked into the
[1:15:56] mark of the beast
[1:16:00] they're being tranquilized
[1:16:03] and demonized
[1:16:06] they don't even know it
[1:16:08] brother and sister we're close
[1:16:11] it's later than you think and they feel
[1:16:14] like
[1:16:15] it's all right
[1:16:18] everything is all right
[1:16:22] nothing wrong with it
[1:16:26] as long as we're worshiping god that's
[1:16:28] all right
[1:16:30] i felt like cain thought
[1:16:32] it's all right what i'm doing and the
[1:16:34] sacrifice that i'm giving god it's all
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:38] nothing wrong with what i'm doing but
[1:16:41] god put a what
[1:16:43] a mark on it
[1:16:45] and he went out from the way the
[1:16:48] presence of god
[1:16:50] the people don't know that god put a
[1:16:52] mark
[1:16:53] on them
[1:16:55] and that's the mark of the beast
[1:16:58] but king was of the what
[1:17:01] wicked one
[1:17:03] are you with me
[1:17:04] so god put a mark on him
[1:17:08] could it be in this hour god is putting
[1:17:10] a mark
[1:17:12] and they're going out from nowhere
[1:17:15] presence of the lord amen

[1:32:57] let's get it straight now
[1:33:01] so here out there
[1:33:04] jonah
[1:33:06] perhaps he didn't know what was awaiting
[1:33:08] him
[1:33:09] but he was willing amen that the ship
[1:33:12] could sail
[1:33:14] and that the storm could stop
[1:33:18] brother and sister
[1:33:19] could you be the hold up
[1:33:23] could you be the one that's standing in
[1:33:26] the way
[1:33:30] of your own personal breakthrough
[1:33:34] could you be the one could you could
[1:33:37] could it not be amen
[1:33:39] other folks from the outside could you
[1:33:41] be the problem

[1:33:50] jonah recognized he was a problem
[1:33:56] there was no more he
[1:34:00] brother and sister can't you see
[1:34:02] it was exciting
[1:34:05] for jonah to experience
[1:34:07] the supernatural god in a supernatural
[1:34:10] way
[1:34:11] when he was willing to give himself up
[1:34:16] he did not know on the other side of his
[1:34:19] circumstances and his situation that he
[1:34:22] was going to receive a supernatural
[1:34:24] experience
[1:34:26] that was going to be something greater
[1:34:28] than he ever experienced
[1:34:31] are you with me
[1:34:33] and when he
[1:34:35] throws him overboard he finds himself
[1:34:37] ha
[1:34:39] oxygen
[1:34:41] in a fish
[1:34:42] at the bottom of the sea
[1:34:47] and then now i can see him
[1:34:50] the word of god coming to him that
[1:34:52] solomon prayed
[1:34:54] if
[1:34:55] we're carried astray and if we look
[1:34:57] towards that temple
[1:35:00] then lord hear the prayer
[1:35:04] he said i'm gonna look towards that holy
[1:35:06] temple
[1:35:08] and he began to pray
[1:35:12] god on the other side
[1:35:16] john recognized i'm not dead
[1:35:21] he was walking around in
[1:35:23] this great fish
[1:35:25] belly
[1:35:28] did he know what the future hell
[1:35:32] at the bottom of the sea said out of the
[1:35:34] depths of hell i cried
[1:35:38] brother and sister when we find
[1:35:39] ourselves so low

[1:36:16] of desperation and

[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:22] god on the scene
[1:36:25] i said it's time for your desperation
[1:36:27] time
[1:36:28] to call god on the scene for

[1:36:55] and god was gonna turn around and cause
[1:36:58] you to bless
