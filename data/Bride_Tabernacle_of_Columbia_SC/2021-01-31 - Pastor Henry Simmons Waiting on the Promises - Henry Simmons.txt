[Music] i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and he heard my cry he bought me up also out of a harbor pit and out of the maori clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings he has put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respect not the proud not such as turn aside to lies may god bless you read this word you may be seated in um psalms 37 and 7 amen we want to talk to you a little bit this morning about waiting on the promises he's saying standing on the promises of the lord god our savior through eternal ages let us praise his reign i'm standing on the promises of christ our king i'm standing on his promises today amen god promised something amen god keeps his promises amen if god has promised in his word that he would do something the bible says that the word of god when it goes out of god's mouth it should not return unto him void but it shall accomplish that which is senate to do if god sent the word he meant to heal them it heals them amen so god's word will not come back and say god i could not achieve or accomplish what you sent me to do because god's word will accomplish that which he sent it to do and this morning amen as amen as partakers of the divine nature and of the word of god you and i amen that are outsprings of god that amen are partakers of his divine nature amen and we are part of that word amen because we in the beginning before the foundation of the world in the mind of god god thought about you and i and when we were a part of god's thinking amen then god knew exactly what age and what time we would be born and amen and god knew that you amen will catch a hold to what he's doing in the promises of this hour praise god because people go to church and amen they just go through the motions amen but they have no idea the time in the day and the hour they live in and that's why i choose for a sub topic where the concrete is amen where the carcass is he said there were the eagles be gathered together are you with me it seems like something strange but let me just try to get to psalms 37 for a moment and seven psalms 37 and 7. it says here rest in the lord amen rest in the lord amen he said come unto me all you that leave in heaven laden and i will give you rest amen so he says rest in the lord amen if there's any place that we should find rest amen it ought to be in the lord amen we ought not to be weary and amen frighten ourselves amen we ought to be resting in the lord if we're not resting that means we're not in the lord he said come to me all you to leave and heaven laden and i'll give you for your soul so he says he'll rest amen waiting on the promises of the lord on the day of pentecost they were retiring in the city of jerusalem and wait there until you be endured with power from on high are you with me so they were waiting on the promise god promised that i would not leave your confidence that i will come to you i'm going to fill you with my spirit i'm with you but i shall be in you he made a promise that he was going to keep and i said god still keeps his promise amen so much and so that job declared amen joel declared that in the last days said god that i poured my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy young men should see vegan the old men should dream dream and on that day i will pour out of my spirit amen i believe that peter stood up when they said these men are drunk these men are full of new wine but he said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days said god that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh see that promise that he made enjoyal the promise that he made in isaiah concerning the baptism of the holy ghost the promises of god were always for a certain season amen see in the season somebody says he's our own time god for the season that god amen he made the promise but it was to come forth in his season at the time that god had appointed that word to be fulfilled are you with me so when god made a promise to the children of israel it meant that after 400 years they're going to sojourn in a strange land and they were going to be in bondage for 400 years but after that i'm going to deliver you and somebody said they were in egypt for 430 years are you with me so after 400 years they the bible said the time of the promise drew near amen god knew that it was the seat and it was the time it meant that the promise should be fulfilled so amen god amen moses parents saw that he was a proper child amen and the god amen had ordained this particular vessel amen to be raised up amen to be a prophet amen and to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt back to the promised land god had an appointed time and god had a vessel that was going to be born in a certain season and nobody else could take moses place because god had ordained for moses to do the job it doesn't matter how well amen other folks were it doesn't matter how good they were and how holy they were god said moses this is your time and god took moses amen on the back side of the desert and he was 80 years old before he was able to accomplish to achieve the mission that he was born for brother and sister sometimes we think that amen we'll pass the time amen that we are to fulfill god's plan for the hour and for the day that we're living in but look like time has evaded us and we have gotten too old to fulfill what god said amen look like time has passed us by amen but god amen keeps his promise as i said on friday look like amen after amen the children of israel after abraham had gotten so old and sarah wound was dried up god still says amen amen i got a promise that i'm going to keep amen sarah gonna have that child i don't care how how how looked and i'm telling you brother and sister it looked like in this age that the bride amen will jesus have a bride will there be a rapture will there be a changing of the body will there be amen somebody that would be there amen that would have faith enough amen out of all the chaos and all the all the uh commotion that are going on in the world with the pandemic and the political system the world chaos will there be somebody that's looking to jesus amen for the promise that he promised in this hour will there be a people that are amen hungering and thirsting amen for a word from the lord something that would energize their faith something that was terrible amen i believe amen it said he'll take it'll take those tunnels to wake up the bride i believe that god amen will thunder amen and the voice of god will speak in such a way that it will wake the bride up hallelujah and i believe we have been awoken amen something has woke us up and that is the voice of god in this hour so he says in psalm 37 7 rest in the lord and what wait patiently i i'm going to tell you it's something about patience that's why luke says in i think 21 19 something like that he says in your patient possess you your soul and the bible says in ii peter an account that the long suffering of god is salvation see sometimes it's not enough just to wait but to wait with patience amen you know and keller was talking about keep your focus keep focusing on god don't don't worry about this all the stuff that's going on people hey hey this is happening that happened doesn't it oh yes there's a lot of things happening but our focus is on the promises of god and what god has ordained for you our lives we must be we must zero in on that and we must keep our focus on what god promised for our lives and what the bride is to be amen and if the bride is to be such a spoken word bride then she must be able to speak the word and she must be able to manifest what sons and god the sons of god and daughters of god is in this hour amen that's the thing that matters nothing else i said nothing else amen all the other stuff it might always might be important to somebody it might be important but that's not important to us our eye the focus on one thing amen and that is the changing of the body amen amen you all just mean so much oh we keep driving all over you this is the our eyes are focused on one thing lord that will that would be a people that would come to maturity that would be overcomers in this age that would be those that are hot and on fire amen there would not be a lukewarm people that'll take the rapture there will be a people that's amen waited patiently amen you know something about amen not being patient we'll try to manufact and i think the people in the message and the bride for years have tried to manifest the manufact amen the the coming of the lord amen it came out they met in 77 and they thought amen certainly this must be the rapture time in 88 they thought the whole world is saying amen this is the rapture time people wrote books all over the place 88 is a rapture time and then when the year 2000 comes certainly amen six days on the seventh day god rested suddenly this is the time and when 2000 passed by amen they thought amen the whole world was shut down in 2000 amen but nevertheless when 2001 came amen it was another year and we are here in 20 years later and amen and we're seeing that god made promises and when god made promises amen sometimes we get impatient and sometimes we get ourselves caught up with the affairs of this life sometimes we'll we'll think that uh you know they said in ii peter well since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as a word from the beginning of creation amen but we got to watch out because the devil will try to fan you to sleep praise god waited patiently for him he said fret not yet thou self because of him that prospered in his way are you with me some folk ain't doing right but they're prospering but he said to you what don't you worry about that that ain't under your business are you with me he said fret not yourself for them to prosper in their way because because of the man who brings what wicked devices to pass are you with me somebody said well i won the lottery i did this and i did that but you say i'm a christian i don't gamble are you with me but when a jackpot gets so high and you look around to the left and look round to the right look right behind nobody knows i think i'll take a chance because god might want to bless me and i want to bless somebody you see what i'm saying it calls it the best of men and best of us amen people uh amen uh uh themselves and because somebody else prospering they think amen somebody else won a hundred thousand dollars with the rap what somebody else won so much and so i'm gonna take a chance i can't hardly make ends meet but if i spend a couple of dollars in this i think i'll make it you see how it is the devil will tempt you the devil will try you and you if you're not holding fast and waiting patiently on the lord on the promises of god amen and you're not standing on his promises and you're not saying god i'm gonna trust you regardless of what i have to go through lord i trust you amen you said i've never seen the right of a sinking of seed begging brain you say you supply all of our needs economy richer than glory god i wait on you waiting on the promises of god but i gotta wait patiently he said in the 81st cease from anger some of us get upset upset about things that we don't need to be upset about because amen cease from anger don't be all mean and mad and upset about everything that's going on sometimes we're angry because of the political system we're angry because uh people commit abortion we're angry because uh uh men with men we're angry just get an angry spirit people that got so angry to the attack amen the the sinning and the evil it's an angry set of people amen supposed to be good people christian hearted people supposedly oh you but they got angry because they want to see things you know i i guess some of them want to see things go right i don't know but we don't want to get involved in the political system we don't want to get in par with who's right and who's wrong and all of that we want to get involved with the kingdom of god people are dying and losing their soul amen but the rapture is right at hand right now amen if you're not careful you'll get so involved in the things of political system and amen and we'll lose our soul are you with me oh we're standing up for oh no let's stand for god amen praise god my kingdom is not of this world are you with me so we're not fighting for democrat republican amen our kingdom is not of this world it's jesus christ let's let him have the preeminence in our lives let's look to jesus jesus are you coming soon and i want to be ready amen i love you with all my heart and i want to wait patiently on you are you with me but sometimes folks are getting caught up oh oh no no don't do all of that don't get worked up on those things amen those things are fair you brother sister you put your confidence in man man of failure will put your confidence in the word of god it says cease from anger and forsake wrath people are you know people are fighting they're so angry they're fighting wrath just mad mad at what the world they're just mad see it's from wrath it's a lot of bitterness in people people are just bitter mad angry [Music] you can't hardly hear a good conversation sometime amen but let's let's start looking at how good god is let's look at where god bought us from he said he bought me out of the morry clay and out of a horrible pit are you with me look where god brought you and i'm from we got so much to praise the lord for to all the negative stuff put it to the side and say lord i thank you you know i heard the prophet say you know and he said let us lay aside every weight he said now when god said let us lay aside every weight the prophet said see sometimes the people want the lord to take the weight from them i want the lord to lay their weights away he said let us he said there's something you got to do he said if you're drinking or you uh uh have a sin in your life then you got to lay aside the weight don't ask god to do that for you he said he said you got to do it he said once you come to the decision in your heart and in your mind that you gonna lay it down then that's when god will step in but you got to make that decision he said what is it if god does it for you then there's no victory there's nothing you overcame he said but the victory is when you make up in your mind that i'm not going to drink anymore i'm not going to smoke my joint anymore [Music] amen i'm getting rid of these demons out of my life [Music] lord amen i'm looking for the coming of the lord and i'm waiting patiently on you it gets wrapped sometimes you get taught sometimes it gets lonely sometimes well i'm waiting on you oh you look man so but sometimes he said fret not yourself in any wise to do evil amen sometimes you're tempted when things get rough he said don't do evil don't don't do it amen the young people are facing challenges every day that's pornography there's fornicating and there's a all kind of stuff that goes on and the young people are being tempted amen and the devil is trying to draw you under that spirit and that power but he said fret not yourself in any ways to do evil don't do it amen it doesn't matter how much i tell you not to do it it's whether or not you're going to wait patiently on the promises of god i'ma wait to god give me a husband i'ma wait to god give me a wife i waited patiently on the law [Music] and he said the lord heard my cry amen the same god that heard your crime when you said lord i want you to save me i want you to forgive me of my sin i want you to come into my life god would do the same thing if you wait patiently [Music] if he was able to do that what about what you're going through right now he'll do it for you but you got to wait patiently on it he said for evil duels shall be cut off but those that what those that wait upon the lord shall what shall inherit the earth amen for yet a what see sometimes it ain't a long time life itself isn't but a little while amen if you look at life itself how fast it's moving it's nothing but a little while we around here amen he said yet a little while and the wicked shall not be are you with me so all your enemies and all the wicked all the stuff people try to say and do to you a little while and the wicked shall not be not like he said that a worry amen oh it ceased from troubling and we'll find rest amen god's going to give you you have rest in christ now all you've got to do is rest in him [Music] oh god he said yet a little while and the wicked shall not be ye shall thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek the humble but to me let's just see how humble we can be oftentimes say and you know sometimes as the young person you don't know what the bishop is saying he says you should always say don't ever ask god to humble you the bible said humble yourself you he said you rather humble yourself then ask god to do it because if god has to humble you you're gonna have to go through but if you humble yourself amen it goes back to what the prophet says some things that we got to do ourselves amen what it is you're going to go to heaven and didn't do nothing you didn't overcome nothing amen god you were tested you were tried and you never won a victory you said lord amen lord you do this for me you do that for me god said do this for yourself that's why he said on the day of pentecost save your what save yourself from this untoward generation save yourself how can i save myself by accepting what jesus said in his word and say lord i'm standing on your word amen i have decided to make jesus my choice amen god i believe you amen when you believe him like the word says he said the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are fall even as many as the lord our god shall call amen you've got to know that amen god don't only save your you but he'll save your children amen he'll save them that'll fall amen you got to hold the god promise amen god i know you'll do it amen i know you did it for me i know you'll do it for my children i'm holding i'm holding on to god's unchanging hand oh yes you got to hold on you can't amen look at the amen what scene you got to look to the unseen amen praise god you got to believe that god is going and he got he got it he can hound it don't fret yourself for the meeks shall inherit the earth and should enlighten themselves in the abundancy of what peace i'm going to tell you something that's a reality brother and sister the abundancy of peace god that's what god wants you to have as a christian god wants us to have peace amen and i believe if we just rest in him and delight ourselves in the lord amen and he'll give us the desires of our heart amen praise god as long as your heart desires to please god then god will give you the desires of your heart if your heart desire amen is the word amen praise god i want my desire to be his desire i want my will to be his will and i know his will is his word isn't that right so i want god to have the preeminence in my life and god have your way let me just try to do a little bit on where the conquest is that where the eagles be gathered so let's go to matthew 24 for a minute and i'm going to try to not be long i got so much on waiting patiently on the lord waiting on the promises until i just want to just dub into this and seek it and run together oh for where the caucus is there with the eagles be gathered it's 24 and 28 matthew 24 28. it says and whether so ever the caucus is there with the eagles be gathered together amen it's and the question was to god's servant what is the they said what is the uh the eagles and what is the caucus amen so let us look at uh the book of job 39 job 39 what is the caucus where the caucus is we all the time we are always here where the caucus is that he gets regarding the people but do you really know what you're screaming about do you really understand what you're hauling about the conquerors is that where the eagles be gathered together sometimes we hear signs and every group of people have certain signs and and is usually stirred a crowd because and people take for granted that i understand why i'm stirring and why i'm fired up you know when you start talking about the holy ghost and people get excited hallelujah praise the lord and don't have nothing but when you really got the holy ghost and you hollering screaming thank the lord when i hear about the holy ghost and his power it does something to me when you're really saved and god has really saved you we have bought you out of that harbor pit and out of the mora clay when he really done that for you and you really realize amen god's saving grace and what he's done to you and when you hear somebody talk about the blood of jesus and what it'll do for you to wash in to make you clean when he really clean you up yeah hey it means something but when you're talking about it and that person have not overcome and don't have any victory in their life amen and their holiness yeah because everybody's hollering that don't mean you've been washed in the blood amen that don't mean you really understand it because it hasn't been a manifestation in your life you haven't amen praise god really been washed in the blood heaven really amen it hasn't really entered down in your spirit not in your heart and your soul amen in heaven amen really gonna work for you but once you're saved and you know that you're saved and once you know that the love of god has come in your heart what amen that saturday i know god seeing me one day amen i know you see me amen i don't amen i don't have to prove it to nobody i know he changed me praise god some folk amen you can try to tell people i'm changed i don't do that no more i don't go there they ain't gonna never believe you don't you wasting your time they believe that you the same old same old so you just might as well just quit amen i you know i love the lord they said well i went to church one time too and i loved the law one time but i found out amen ain't number devils in the church so i stopped going to church because preachers ain't right 13 right they try to talk you out of your god they try to tell you amen they ain't the church to save you anyway it ain't the people that go to church savior it ain't the preacher that's saying but you got in contact with god himself i asked god to see me i asked god to change me i asked god to film me praise god i ain't asked the church to see him i didn't ask the preacher to see me i asked god to do it i mean i i i i wanted somebody know what i'm talking about praise god i asked god to do it for me i'm out of the young boy but i asked god to say amen because i wanted to know i'm saved praise god and i i wanted to see the effects of salvation amen and the change that was made in my life and i know he did it praise god i don't care how many of my friends look at miss trains amen i didn't care how many young ladies look at you oh you still the same didn't matter amen i i just had to walk away sometimes i felt sad for them praise god because i wanted to tell them about the love of god and some of them some of my friends say oh this is coming here in hand you've been saved all your life and you ain't been like us you know who told me that like the ones that needed god that were worse the one that you know ain't got no business being in the street you know they what you call them lame they don't know what's going on and you're trying to tell them about god and they tell me they're almost calling you and i'm gonna tell you something that's the way folks are doing you the devil have folks so blind out there oh you would but when you god save you you can't worry about what they say about you you ain't saved i'm waiting someone some of them said well i'm waiting i just wait you'll be back here in about a year or two amen it'll wire off you

where the caucus is there where the eagerness be gathered what is the caucus and who the eagles he says in 39 in jobs in 27. does the eagle mount up at that command and make her nest on high she dwelleth and abides on the rock and upon the jagged of the the rock and the stun strong pla place from hence convince she seeketh her prey and her eyes behold a fall her young ones also suck up the work the blood and where the slain are there she is the young ones is the little eaglets are you with me the eagle amen they call in the bible they call iselle the eagle i prophet so prophets are called eagles amen because they're able to see or fall off are you with me so with their eagle eye they look and they tell you things that ought to come amen so the prophets are the eagles so where is the caucus amen the caucus is the fresh meat the fresh kill amen because the eagles will not eat what a buzzard eat you remember buzzer to eat dead stuff to swollen all off and worms in it and all of that there's no fresh no the blood is not there are you with me so the caucus is the word it's just like the man of fell in the wilderness and they were to eat that matter the day it fell but if they try to hide some man and keep it back it got worms in it are you with me and so amen you had to eat on monday what god a place there on monday you had to eat it then because if you try to save it the tuesday it wouldn't work so what are you saying if i preach noah's message and if i build an ark it won't save you today are you with me if i preach what moses preached i can preach it for an example to encourage you amen but that's not what god has ordained for us for this day are you with me so the caucus amen is amen the fresh manner the fresh word the word for the day and i will you live in the eagle is the prophet amen the bible says amen if we believe his prophets so shall we prosper are you what man and the bible says surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals the secrets to his servant the prophets amen and where the caucus is that will the eagles be gathered the ego lets a together amen where the fresh manner is y'all notice amen there were seven church ages and there were three there were four living creatures before the throne of god one with the face of a lion one with the face of a ox one with the face of a man one with the face of an eagle all right are you with me and as the seals were open there were horse riders that went out but there was when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the lord lifted up a standing so when the white horse went out it meant there was an anointing to come forth like a lion they meant to go forward at that particular rider are you up man so amen so much and so in every age the ox age they remember people had to die and so forth in every age amen and every period of time so much and so till we got to y'all know this alone it's long so i'm cutting this out are you with me but you you follow me in this age remember the lion amen the ox of the calf and the man all of them are earthbound and all of them drank milk as bait but we said where the carcass is where the fresh kill meet it's got blood in it the eagles want something that's fresh and got blood and where the meat is you're in the time amen that he says that you're not to just have the principles of the doctrine we're to go on to perfection this is where god has uh prepared amen the word for your hour to take you into perfection because he's gonna have a church without spot without wrinkle without limits or any such thing but it should be holy and without blame are you with me so god amen will give you a word that will give you the strength that you need to fly in the rapture are you with me so the eagles get to meet eat the meat and they mine up with wings and they fly so we're not earthbound we're heavenly bound so this is the rapture age amen what will change for moderating mortality change in the moment of the tweaking of the lord call up to meet him in there where the caucus is amen faith come by hearing are you with me and hearing by the word of god so there must be a word in this hour to give us faith to get out of here so god send the word to give us faith to get out of here to mine up with wings as an eagle so as we come down to the end and uh psalms 27. it's so much i told you it was it was two lessons i'm trying to blend together psalms 27. it says here 27-14 and he says wait on the lord and be of good courage and he shall what strengthen thy hearts psalms 27 and 14 wait on the lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen our heart wait our saying on the lord waiting patiently on the lord so it's so many people work themselves up i was talking to one of the majors that i baptized over in england some years ago and we was talking about some of the brothers and sisters that i baptized in england and he's still holding out he's preaching down in florida and and i was glad to you know touch bases with dr shipman and he says he said uh brother simmons you know a lot of people got excited and they thought the rapture was going to take place right then and he said it didn't take place so it shook a lot of people faith amen that's why i says waiting on the promises you got to wait patiently that's why i read songs wait patiently don't don't get so worked up and excited that amen i i i can't wait no more wait patiently somebody began to lose confidence in the word that the word ain't gonna do what it says but you gotta wait patiently and uh the major said he said now he started saying some of those and some of the ones we baptized and he said you know what was wrong with them amen they got too excited amen they thought it would take place right then amen but i told them amen someone wanted to get out the air force i said don't get out the air force stay in and get all your benefits because they thought the coming of the lord was going to come then brother and sister if they could get that excited back then and i was heard hearing uh a brother from south africa he said you know people in you should be so excited about the word they were so stirred up you can show them what the prophet said and the people would really get in tune they'll go right to it do it right away why because they thought the law was coming amen now the people of mine hey god didn't come amen well back then i don't know if he's coming or not i believe it's still coming i believe he's still coming i believe you can still wait on the lord amen i believe we need to be most tired now that we ever been praise god amen i believe we need to be more excited amen we even stopped witnessing amen because the lord didn't come when we thought he ought to come amen we stopped telling people jesus is coming i believe we need to still tell that jesus is coming soon i believe we need to tell him amen that it may be the day it may be tomorrow but he's coming lord have mercy don't let me lose my excitement amen if i stop being excited amen praise god i believe that for the eagle ages god amen has a word for this age that he sent amen that a caucus that fresh man or word for this hour they get the eagle that see amen what we need to mount up amen with wings as an eagle amen praise god something that strengthened us amen something that we've been waiting on hallelujah i believe we need to just amen just feed on that word feed on the word that god give us feed it amen find out that there it's still giving me strength oh the word still got power in it i'm talking about the blood the bloody word the word that's fresh the word that promised for this day they got blood in it amen i know that amen i got a promise for this hour hallelujah no matter what the rest of them take amen i know this is what god ordained for the hour we live in are you with me lord there are many turning back praise god where you going amen praise god you shows what kind of bird you are it shows what you are and it'll be being manifested look at what you eat and in a show whether you're an eagle or not they meant because if you can eat amen what is dead amen and what's in another age in another day amen if you can eat that stuff and think that you're going to be in raptured condition praise god notice the eagle can fly they met with places that the buzzard can't fly a eagle can see what no other bird can see because he got eagle eyes thank god for eagle eyes thank god that i can see you amen praise god look in the sun and see jesus hallelujah praise god there shall be light in the evening time praise god i thank god for hallelujah and the son of righteousness shall arise with a healing in his way he said at the lightning amen comes out amen of the east all the way to the west even so

keep waiting amen if any man draw back my soul will have no pledge to eat him i'm not of them that draw back but i hear of them that lead to the saving of the soul i got the whole lot if others turn around i can't turn around why god called me for this hour god called me for this time it's time to mount up with wings it's time to fly out of here don't get caught up getting tangled up now amen
