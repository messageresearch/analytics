[34:59] sober and hope to the end for the grace

[35:52] little
[35:55] we thank god again for
[36:00] this day that he's made
[36:02] you know brother and sister
[36:05] i was out here now just reading this
[36:08] chapter
[36:10] this morning as i was
[36:12] i had another way i was gonna go and
[36:16] and as i was down in prayer
[36:19] i got caught up in the spirit and i
[36:21] started
[36:22] speaking in tongues and enjoying the
[36:24] lord
[36:27] and uh
[36:28] i was so excited about what god was
[36:30] saying to my spirit
[36:33] and i i it was beyond
[36:36] you
[36:38] know beyond just being normal
[36:43] and i was already you know had several
[36:46] ways to come
[36:48] and talk about i
[36:50] thought i was going to talk about out of
[36:52] order
[36:53] are out of position
[36:56] a positionally placed as the prophet
[36:59] said
[37:00] and talk about adoption and so forth
[37:05] and i realized that so oftentimes our
[37:09] problems are
[37:11] because of people are out of position
[37:15] you know
[37:16] there are many that want certain
[37:17] positions
[37:19] that is not for them
[37:22] amen
[37:24] absalom wanted to be king
[37:29] so he
[37:32] he devised a scheme whereby he can get
[37:34] what he wants
[37:37] you see what i'm saying sometimes amen
[37:41] we want what god don't want us to have
[37:44] amen amen
[37:46] and
[37:47] sometimes we'll set out on god
[37:50] you know
[37:52] it was the spirit of god telling me like
[37:55] a little child and they can't get
[37:56] without
[37:57] fall out and roll on the floor and
[38:00] scream and
[38:02] you know the mama said okay okay
[38:03] [Music]
[38:05] what you want baby
[38:07] so the baby cries and you give him some
[38:10] milk
[38:13] check the diaper ain't nothing wrong
[38:15] [Music]
[38:16] just keep on hollering
[38:19] so the parents try to find out what's
[38:21] wrong
[38:23] what's what the child is doing trying to
[38:25] boss the parent around
[38:28] that the parent can't get a revelation
[38:29] of that when the child is in the crib of
[38:31] a little baby
[38:33] that that child trying to boss them
[38:38] but a lot of times
[38:40] people in the spirit room they try to
[38:42] boss god around
[38:49] if they can't have it
[38:52] i go to a church where i can find it
[38:56] okay i'm looking right here
[38:58] [Music]
[38:59] just whenever they get upset
[39:02] i'm gone
[39:06] it's the lack of
[39:09] in the spirit realm
[39:11] you have a lot of crybabies
[39:14] it used to be where we played
[39:16] basketball or whatever
[39:18] you know a football a street ball
[39:23] and sometimes you had to choose your
[39:25] team especially in basketball
[39:28] and if the ball belonged to a certain
[39:29] fellow
[39:31] nobody wanted to choose him to play
[39:35] he'd take his ball and go home
[39:38] so we ain't got nothing to play with you
[39:40] see what i'm saying
[39:41] and some folks will take their ball and
[39:43] go home
[39:45] because nobody chose them to be on their
[39:48] team
[39:51] and see what happens is nobody can play
[39:54] if i can't play
[39:57] are you with me
[39:59] we have a lot of people do some
[40:01] some stuff in the spirit realm
[40:05] in the spirit realm that they don't even
[40:07] know that they're
[40:09] out of position
[40:13] if i can't have what i want then
[40:16] god i ain't gonna do nothing
[40:19] i ain't gonna do nothing you don't give
[40:21] me what i want i won't i wouldn't clap
[40:23] my hand
[40:26] you think i'm gonna say amen you'll
[40:28] never get me to say amen
[40:33] because i don't have what i want
[40:38] what do you want i don't know
[40:43] what you want god to do for you i don't
[40:45] know
[40:47] but i want what i want
[40:49] so you do everything you can do to try
[40:51] to please the baby
[40:54] give them milk change adopt them
[41:02] you know
[41:04] some parents that have had
[41:06] uh children that
[41:09] have gone through certain changes that
[41:12] you know all of every child is not the
[41:15] same
[41:17] and you got to know when the child is
[41:19] faking
[41:23] are you with me
[41:24] and you know where the child really has
[41:26] a need
[41:30] and a lot of times
[41:33] you know
[41:34] the children practice what they see the
[41:36] parents do
[41:41] a lot of times things ain't right
[41:44] with the headship in the house
[41:48] if
[41:50] mama can't get what she wants
[41:58] then the house is in a turmoil
[42:04] and the children say okay if this work
[42:06] for mama it'll work for me
[42:09] i'm gonna make it chaotic in here
[42:12] if i can't get what i want
[42:15] see we live in a very selfish world
[42:20] where people are so self-centered
[42:26] and sometimes folks are so calm-minded
[42:31] till they're out of position i i don't
[42:33] know how this is going to come together
[42:35] concerning fool's gold
[42:39] are you with me
[42:42] but it's because of lack of position out
[42:45] of place
[42:49] when people are out of position or out
[42:51] of place
[42:56] see you cannot place yourself in
[42:58] position
[43:01] the holy ghost has to position and place
[43:03] you
[43:04] where he wants you to be
[43:07] praise god it's not you might think that
[43:10] this is my position this is where i
[43:12] ought to be but if the holy ghost don't
[43:15] do it then
[43:20] praise god
[43:23] if god don't do it then you don't worry
[43:25] about it
[43:26] [Music]
[43:28] are you with me
[43:30] somebody taking my nobody can ever
[43:33] be you
[43:36] and nobody can ever even stop you from
[43:39] what god has for you
[43:42] they can try
[43:45] i'm talking about real gold
[43:48] and fool's goal
[43:50] are you with me
[43:51] it's a difference between real gold and
[43:54] fuel gold
[43:56] see gold has to be got to go through
[44:01] they got to go through the fire
[44:04] and so if you got it right
[44:07] if you really
[44:09] uh real gold then you're gonna have to
[44:11] go through the fire
[44:13] [Music]
[44:16] now
[44:17] amen you can determine whether or not
[44:19] it's full goal a real goal
[44:22] amen by how it reacts to the fire
[44:27] are you with me
[44:29] amen because some folk came in react
[44:33] amen to their reaction to the fire
[44:37] it does not purify them but
[44:43] are you with me
[44:45] so often times our reaction
[44:48] amen
[44:50] [Music]
[44:56] now let me try to
[44:58] put this together
[45:00] because a lot of times our problems
[45:03] amen
[45:04] because we're out of place and out of
[45:06] position amen if the home is out of
[45:09] position
[45:10] amen
[45:11] then the children
[45:13] if the head ship in the home
[45:15] amen is out of position then the
[45:17] children somewhat get despondent
[45:20] displaced and confused and
[45:23] and they go to school and they have a
[45:25] complexes and they don't know how amen
[45:29] to you know how to position themselves
[45:32] in life
[45:34] because they meant because there is not
[45:36] a level of understanding they have not
[45:39] seen
[45:40] and because in so many homes there is
[45:43] not a
[45:43] father and a mother that's sometimes
[45:46] there's single parents
[45:48] and they're trying to do the best that
[45:50] they can
[45:52] so a lot of times young men can see
[45:54] headship so they don't really know how
[45:57] to be a man
[46:00] are you with me
[46:01] and then when handshape come amen praise
[46:05] god
[46:06] you know
[46:07] i i i want to tell you there's so many
[46:09] sisters amen
[46:11] i've seen sisters that more spiritual
[46:14] than me they could preach a better
[46:16] sermon than i can they they they they're
[46:20] more gifted than i can
[46:22] i am and i've seen god really deal with
[46:25] them amen
[46:26] but
[46:28] you may amen have all the quality
[46:31] spiritual revelation knowledge amen and
[46:34] think came in amen i'm better than my
[46:37] husband
[46:39] amen but a wise
[46:41] and a godly woman will submit herself
[46:45] even though
[46:50] even though she knows
[46:53] amen that she's on another level
[46:57] but she's a godly woman
[46:59] and she understands her hat
[47:02] is a husband
[47:05] are you up man
[47:06] so she submits herself willingly
[47:11] not because he amen says i am the head
[47:14] and i am who i am
[47:18] see amen
[47:21] that's the way amen the church is
[47:23] subject to christ
[47:26] willingly and humbly
[47:29] not because he's going to beat us over
[47:30] the head because we love him amen
[47:35] i said
[47:36] it's a lack of love
[47:38] we must know the position
[47:41] and the place that god has uh amen
[47:45] ordained for you and i
[47:47] for concerning our homeland and where
[47:51] we're positioning the place
[47:53] in the hour of the end time
[47:57] and what god is requiring amen for you
[48:00] and i is not
[48:03] what it was when paul says as a wise
[48:05] master builder i have laid the
[48:08] foundation
[48:10] faith amen
[48:12] virtue now it's temporary but we're in
[48:14] hatchet time
[48:16] [Music]
[48:17] what god amen is looking for you to be
[48:20] amen walk in perfect love
[48:24] are you with me
[48:26] so god is requiring amen but your faith
[48:31] amen
[48:32] has to be tried and tested
[48:35] because god is positionally placing you
[48:39] in the place that you
[48:42] need to be in this hour
[48:45] not only is it a positionally placing
[48:48] the church the bride
[48:50] in her position in her homeland but you
[48:54] as individuals
[48:58] amen
[48:59] not you so much is fine in your place
[49:01] but yet you must find your place
[49:08] let him lead you
[49:12] amen let him guide you
[49:16] hallelujah
[49:17] because the holy ghost knows what amen
[49:20] what he wants to do with the word
[49:25] praise god
[49:27] and you being part of him who is the
[49:30] wife
[49:32] then god knows amen how and where he
[49:35] wants to positionally place you in the
[49:38] body
[49:40] are you with me
[49:42] because we don't know ourselves
[49:45] we just yield to god's will
[49:48] god let your perfect will be done
[49:51] in my life
[49:52] because i can't lead myself
[49:55] but why you lead me
[49:58] i'll follow
[50:01] i need him to lead me
[50:04] i need him to guide me
[50:07] oh great jehovah
[50:09] hallelujah
[50:10] you need him brother sister
[50:14] now
[50:18] i i i i said don't
[50:21] don't be a fool
[50:26] y'all ever heard somebody say that how
[50:28] many you ever heard somebody said don't
[50:29] be a fool
[50:32] amen the bible said call no man be a
[50:35] fool
[50:36] but a fool said it's hard there no god
[50:40] in the right
[50:41] he said paul says oh
[50:44] you foolish galatians
[50:46] he said call no man fool who has been
[50:49] with you
[50:52] are you with me
[50:53] so he i so
[50:55] don't mind me when i said don't be a
[50:58] fool
[50:59] amen
[51:00] amen
[51:04] praise god don't be a fool
[51:07] let me describe
[51:09] what the words say
[51:11] amen
[51:13] and i said don't let the devil
[51:15] [Music]
[51:17] blind you amen amen
[51:20] don't let the devil
[51:23] blind you or fool you
[51:28] because the devil amen
[51:31] he'll blind you and he'll fool you he'll
[51:34] make you think you've got something
[51:36] that's real
[51:38] amen
[51:39] and it can't go through the test
[51:42] you'll find that when it's tried the
[51:45] fire come
[51:46] it burns up
[51:50] what happens
[51:51] when god is taking you through your
[51:53] trial
[51:57] you messing with me you watch that flesh
[51:59] rise up
[52:02] watch that flesh
[52:04] watch with the things that folks say and
[52:06] the action that folks act like they oh
[52:10] no
[52:11] is that christ
[52:13] is that christ like is that jesus
[52:17] is that the way a christian ought to
[52:19] respond
[52:21] uh uh uh uh
[52:23] tell me is this real goal or is this
[52:25] fool go
[52:28] he's saying the trine of your faith is
[52:31] more what
[52:33] more precious than what
[52:35] gold
[52:36] are you with me
[52:38] so
[52:40] here we said don't be
[52:43] don't let the devil blind you hear
[52:45] revelation all
[52:47] three amen because i believe
[52:50] the devil has
[52:52] blinded so many people till they think
[52:54] they got real gold and they got fools
[52:57] going
[52:58] you know it looked like gold
[53:02] amen but a real
[53:04] somebody that's
[53:06] you know if you want to test it
[53:08] just put the fire to it
[53:11] see because some folks are trying to
[53:13] convince you that they got real gold
[53:17] praise god i got faith i believe every
[53:19] word i believe the prophet i believe the
[53:21] bible i believe everything
[53:24] who are you trying to convince
[53:26] the five gonna tell it
[53:30] are you with me
[53:31] the fire approve it
[53:35] are you with me man
[53:37] oh i'm leaving the master i believe the
[53:38] bible no the father will tell the story
[53:43] was it not its full goal or was it not
[53:45] just
[53:48] the lord oh yeah the fire tell us
[53:51] it's not how loud you scream and not how
[53:54] much you trump and
[53:56] it's not amen because you go to broad
[53:58] tabernacle or because you say i believe
[54:01] the message or or we go to this one or
[54:03] that one amen is whether or not amen
[54:06] praise god
[54:08] let's put the word
[54:10] amen to it
[54:12] amen
[54:14] amen let's put the word to it
[54:17] praise god amen because the word amen
[54:21] our god is a consuming fire
[54:25] amen praise god let's put the word
[54:27] jeremiah said
[54:28] it was in me like fire
[54:30] [Music]
[54:32] amen amen shut up in my bones
[54:35] lord have mercy amen sometimes amen
[54:39] amen we have to go through manifold
[54:42] temptation
[54:44] glory to jesus
[54:46] sometimes we have to go through some
[54:48] stuff
[54:50] we can't get around it
[54:52] praise god we have to amen we have to be
[54:55] talked about building stone
[54:58] light old
[55:00] treat it wrong
[55:03] thank you jesus
[55:06] i was telling
[55:08] one of the little brothers amen i said
[55:10] folk do all kind of stuff and say you
[55:12] know folk know you better than you know
[55:14] yourself
[55:15] they know you better than god know you
[55:19] gonna have a conversation and oh
[55:22] that brother that sister that song so oh
[55:24] about it is that old man they can talk
[55:26] hours about you
[55:28] they know more than you ever knew about
[55:30] yourself
[55:32] amen and then you sometimes you know
[55:35] it's the bible said the lord what
[55:38] knows them that
[55:42] are you up man
[55:44] see amen
[55:46] sometimes amen praise god
[55:49] you got to forget about all the outside
[55:51] noise
[55:54] and all the nonsense talking won't get
[55:57] you nowhere
[56:02] because
[56:04] sometimes if that person got a problem
[56:06] the bible said it's strong or what
[56:10] are you with me
[56:13] the thing is that are you praying amen
[56:16] for your brother or for your sister
[56:20] are you complaining about them
[56:24] see i i was telling caleb the other day
[56:27] i said
[56:28] caleb
[56:30] i mean
[56:31] you can't i think we were riding in the
[56:34] car and i said you see that car that
[56:36] white car that black car
[56:38] and the different colored cars i said a
[56:40] blind man it don't matter how much i
[56:43] tell him that's a white card
[56:46] he blind can't see
[56:48] it
[56:49] there's no use of me trying to beat that
[56:51] in his head that hey you see that that
[56:54] that's that's a purity mountain
[56:59] he can't imagine in his mind and he
[57:00] still can't see her
[57:02] you don't know whether the mountain got
[57:04] green grass or got tall trees
[57:07] all they could imagine or that but you
[57:09] don't know you can't see it why because
[57:12] you're blind
[57:14] are you with me
[57:16] and sometimes we get mad at somebody
[57:18] that's blind
[57:22] when the folks are blind and you getting
[57:24] upset amen you ought to stop
[57:27] you ought to start drinking you ought to
[57:29] talk you know to stop
[57:31] living
[57:34] a blind man amen
[57:37] why are you getting upset with them pray
[57:39] for them
[57:41] because if their eyes would ever come
[57:43] open they'll know amen i'm getting ready
[57:46] to kill myself
[57:49] are you a man
[57:52] see what happens amen the thing folk do
[57:56] amen they do it sometimes because amen
[58:00] they're ignorant
[58:01] amen amen
[58:04] sometimes folk ain't doing stuff
[58:06] willingly the devil had deceived them
[58:12] and you upset at a deceived person
[58:19] you need you should pity them
[58:23] you should feel sorry for them
[58:26] they still get all oh
[58:29] i'm gonna tell you something i don't
[58:31] know what's going on again oh no no no
[58:34] no
[58:36] somebody said brother sims on someone
[58:38] said
[58:38] i said

[58:44] saying
[58:45] thank you thank you very much
[58:48] god bless you thank you
[58:50] i appreciate that
[58:52] but when you was a baby
[58:55] why did you say that

[59:03] because you're going to pass through
[59:04] some things some fire

[59:09] coming into the place where you're amen
[59:11] you're coming into that place where god

[59:15] amen amen you're coming up a little
[59:17] higher some things they that used to
[59:20] bother you they don't bother you no more

[59:32] of you
[59:34] raise all the impurity out
[59:37] amen that's what some things had to let
[59:40] me come out amen you had to let some
[59:42] stuff come out of you that you didn't
[59:44] know was in you it wasn't because you
[59:47] wouldn't go amen but god was purifying
[59:50] you

[59:58] that meanness at you
[1:00:01] come on somebody

[1:00:06] we talked a little mean
[1:00:08] and we uh our conversation wasn't always
[1:00:12] holy like it ought to be it didn't have
[1:00:15] a love in our speech
[1:00:20] our words were not seasoned with salt
[1:00:24] are you with me
[1:00:25] but god had to even let us go through
[1:00:28] some
[1:00:29] fire
[1:00:33] oh god to feel good
[1:00:35] when the fire burn
[1:00:37] oh you said good this fire was good to
[1:00:40] us

[1:01:46] and depend on jesus
[1:01:49] see i i i'm learning amen
[1:01:53] in the process
[1:01:55] of getting where god wants me to be

[1:02:01] me
[1:02:02] that i got to take some stuff

[1:06:28] amen after speaking in tongues a while i
[1:06:31] began to i want to listen to what you're
[1:06:34] saying lord
[1:06:37] and then i just started listening and
[1:06:39] then i began
[1:06:41] see brother and sister god
[1:06:43] oh god god is a good god
[1:06:47] praise god amen see you ought to try
[1:06:49] spending time in prayer
[1:06:52] and spending time with god can fill you
[1:06:55] with his spirit
[1:06:57] fill you up amen and let your cup
[1:06:59] overflow
[1:07:01] amen and then god began to deal with you
[1:07:04] amen you'll find out it's another
[1:07:07] another whole
[1:07:10] dimension
[1:07:12] as as i said about the blind man look
[1:07:16] 17. he says
[1:07:18] because thou says
[1:07:20] this is not what he says he said i'm
[1:07:22] telling you what you say amen
[1:07:26] are you with me three and 17.
[1:07:30] because thou said
[1:07:32] what
[1:07:35] see what i'm saying
[1:07:37] i'm talking about food gold
[1:07:40] see the food go is
[1:07:43] you say
[1:07:46] the most trouble you have with folk
[1:07:50] is they tell you what they think about
[1:07:52] so
[1:07:54] and then they're tending to somebody
[1:07:55] else's business
[1:07:59] some folks are out of position
[1:08:01] they think they see more than the
[1:08:03] pastors see some of them i can
[1:08:07] but a person does
[1:08:09] they know how to submit
[1:08:12] are you with me
[1:08:14] they know how to submit and be a helper
[1:08:18] not an instigator
[1:08:20] and a divider
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:22] and a problem amen
[1:08:25] are you with me
[1:08:27] if they are more spiritual and god is
[1:08:29] dealing with them they know how to be in
[1:08:31] subjects
[1:08:33] subjection amen other than that you can
[1:08:35] find a house divided
[1:08:38] it cannot work
[1:08:40] it cannot stand
[1:08:42] are you with me
[1:08:44] but
[1:08:45] when it's for the welfare
[1:08:48] amen of the body of
[1:08:50] christ then god uses those things that
[1:08:53] he revealed to be a blessing god will
[1:08:56] not show you something see the prophet
[1:08:58] said is it coveted by the blood then god
[1:09:00] won't show it to him
[1:09:04] are you up man
[1:09:05] but god is showing if it's not confessed
[1:09:09] and covered by the blood oh you look man
[1:09:12] so those things that are not covered by
[1:09:14] the blood
[1:09:16] praise god then god can come up
[1:09:20] and he'll give a word
[1:09:22] because it's not covered by the blood if
[1:09:24] it's covered by the blood then god won't
[1:09:26] let the prophet see amen amen
[1:09:32] now if it's covered by the blood god
[1:09:34] won't let the fire full ministry preach
[1:09:36] on it amen
[1:09:38] but if it's not covered by the blood
[1:09:39] then they can preach it amen
[1:09:42] why because god won't expose it amen
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:48] and then it takes repentance and
[1:09:49] confession
[1:09:51] to get it right
[1:09:53] oh you look man
[1:09:54] but if it's not covered by oh you want
[1:09:56] me
[1:09:57] it's some things god take the cover off
[1:10:00] amen but only those that have eyes to
[1:10:03] see
[1:10:05] can see
[1:10:07] but if the devil has blinded them
[1:10:10] and i don't mean
[1:10:11] with the physical eye but i'm talking
[1:10:13] about the spiritual eye of your
[1:10:14] understanding amen
[1:10:17] amen it takes the holy ghost
[1:10:21] to reveal spiritual things
[1:10:24] see without the holy ghost amen
[1:10:27] people amen they'll go for the fool's
[1:10:30] goal instead of the real thing
[1:10:34] the real thing that god is leading us
[1:10:36] into perfect love
[1:10:38] are you with me
[1:10:40] god wants you to walk in love walk in
[1:10:42] faith to walk in love
[1:10:44] are you up man
[1:10:46] god don't want you to walk
[1:10:50] oh god amen
[1:10:52] let me see because thou says you know
[1:10:56] a lot of
[1:10:57] times
[1:10:58] it's not what we say is what he says
[1:11:02] but he says here because god says i am
[1:11:05] what
[1:11:06] i'm rich and i'm what
[1:11:09] i'm increased with goods and i have what
[1:11:15] you see how needy we are
[1:11:19] lord we need you every hour
[1:11:23] we need you every day lord i have
[1:11:26] things in my life that you're working on
[1:11:29] and lord i don't have time to look at
[1:11:31] other folks because lord you're working
[1:11:33] on me
[1:11:37] lord i need more
[1:11:39] god just help me lord i need help
[1:11:42] see what i'm saying all of us ought to
[1:11:45] look at god we need more of you
[1:11:48] i don't have time to look down on my
[1:11:50] brother my sister amen i need to look to
[1:11:53] god
[1:11:54] for oh
[1:11:58] because i need something amen
[1:12:01] but there are those that said i have
[1:12:03] need of what
[1:12:05] nothing now we look at it as a church
[1:12:07] age but we want to look at it as
[1:12:08] individuals amen with the attitude that
[1:12:11] i don't need nothing
[1:12:13] that's why i can look down on others
[1:12:17] there's a spirit that comes with the
[1:12:19] message of the hour that they look down
[1:12:21] on everybody else
[1:12:24] that they don't have needed nothing
[1:12:30] and that's a sad sad way to be
[1:12:34] are you with me
[1:12:37] but we need him every day and every hour
[1:12:39] amen amen are you with me
[1:12:43] we feel the spirit of
[1:12:46] superior authority
[1:12:49] the jews felt like they were superior to
[1:12:51] the gentiles
[1:12:55] the pharisees felt like they were
[1:12:57] superior as i was reading the church
[1:13:00] ages they feel like they were superior
[1:13:02] to the science season the sadducees like
[1:13:04] vice versa and so forth
[1:13:08] the prophet god talked about in the
[1:13:09] perfect programs age about the first
[1:13:11] church of rome
[1:13:15] and he was telling you how they got in
[1:13:16] the condition that they were in
[1:13:19] and sometimes we
[1:13:21] if we take it through history and bring
[1:13:24] it back to
[1:13:25] present day we'll find that the same
[1:13:27] spirits to work then work right in our
[1:13:30] presence
