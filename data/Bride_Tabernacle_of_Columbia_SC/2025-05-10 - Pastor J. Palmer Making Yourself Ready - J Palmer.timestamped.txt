[28:20] God, for your direction, for your

[28:25] we pray.
[28:29] Amen.
[28:32] Amen. Have your Bibles tonight. Turn
[28:35] with me to the book of
[28:44] Matthew 2
[28:48] through9. Then I'll let you be seated
[28:50] and I'll read one more scripture after
[28:52] that. Amen.
[28:56] Matthew 22 22, excuse me,
[28:59] 22 and
[29:04] two. It reads, "The kingdom of heaven is
[29:09] like unto a certain
[29:11] king, which made a marriage for his
[29:15] son, and sent forth his
[29:19] servants to call them that were bidden
[29:22] to the wedding, and they would not
[29:26] come." Again he sent forth other
[29:29] servants saying, "Tell them which are
[29:32] bidden, Behold, I have prepared," notice
[29:35] this, "I have
[29:38] prepared my dinner, my oxen, my fatlings
[29:42] are killed, and all things
[29:44] already come unto the marriage."
[29:48] But they made light of
[29:50] it, and they went their ways, one of
[29:53] them to his farm, another to his
[29:56] merchandise, and the remnant took his
[29:58] service, and instead them spitefully,
[30:03] and slew them. But when the king heard
[30:06] thereof he was wroth, he sent forth his
[30:09] armies, and destroyed those murderers,
[30:11] and burned up their cities.
[30:14] Then say he to his servants, the wedding
[30:17] is ready, but they which are bidden were
[30:21] not
[30:22] worthy. Go ye therefore into the
[30:25] highways and as many as you find bid to
[30:29] the marriage. Father, we thank you for
[30:32] the reading of your word. Lord God, may
[30:35] you bless it in Jesus name. Amen.
[30:41] I want to go to another scripture there
[30:42] and you can hold your hands there. Uh,
[30:53] Revelation, Revelation 197.
[31:01] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[31:04] honor to him for the marriage of the
[31:07] lamb is come and his wife has made
[31:12] herself ready.
[31:15] Amen. Amen. Tonight I want to use for a
[31:19] little
[31:21] thought making yourself ready and my
[31:25] subtopic is the second coming of Jesus
[31:28] Christ. Amen.
[31:31] making yourself ready.
[31:34] I
[31:35] know that by now we all are hearing or
[31:41] hearding
[31:43] hearing, you know,
[31:45] um report about the Pope being voted in
[31:49] and
[31:51] um
[31:52] something seems to be kind of stirring
[31:56] everybody up a little bit about a thing
[31:58] that, you know, the prophet of God has
[32:00] spoke on and I'm not going to get into
[32:03] that too much. Amen. Probably just work
[32:06] with that some more there at home
[32:07] church. Amen. But tonight, I want to
[32:10] just uh deal with a little bit of
[32:15] um preparing
[32:19] yourself or making yourself
[32:24] ready. Making yourself ready.
[32:29] We see here in Matthew
[32:32] 22 that this king was
[32:36] has
[32:38] preparing a wedding dinner for his
[32:41] son. And
[32:44] he sent
[32:47] out the people to come to the wedding
[32:50] because he had all things already
[32:55] prepared. And I I like I was liking
[32:58] looking at this last night and the other
[33:01] day thinking on it and I was going to go
[33:04] another way but I said you know I'm not
[33:07] going to be long and so just share just
[33:08] a little portion of making yourself. You
[33:13] notice that this I believe is a personal
[33:18] invitation to
[33:20] everyone that has been called by God to
[33:24] this marriage supper.
[33:27] Now
[33:28] noticeably in any
[33:32] wedding there are always
[33:36] invitations that goes
[33:41] out and normally the invitation goes out
[33:45] to some of the people
[33:47] that maybe were special to that briding
[33:50] groom.
[33:53] uh close friends definitely the
[33:57] families and nowadays the people kind of
[34:01] change it up some. they
[34:05] select I guess just numerous of
[34:11] people to come because sometimes of the
[34:15] room that they have to be able to
[34:18] accommodate
[34:19] them and sometime it's for because it
[34:22] gets very expensive when you invite
[34:27] people you are responsible to take care
[34:30] of those
[34:33] people. And just want to paraphrase a
[34:36] little bit. You know, I believe
[34:39] God sent out an invitation.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:46] Now, we understand
[34:50] that it was God that did all the
[34:53] choosing.
[34:57] And we didn't choose him, but he chose
[34:59] us.
[35:01] [Music]
[35:04] And I like the way God do it because he
[35:06] wasn't partial.
[35:08] Thank you.
[35:10] He gave this invitation out to all.
[35:17] And giving an invitation out to all. You
[35:20] know that there some that's not going to
[35:22] come.
[35:24] But Jesus said, "All the Father has,
[35:26] they will come."
[35:30] Many are
[35:32] called, many have heard the
[35:37] gospel, but yet only a
[35:42] few can actually come.
[35:50] I like this because
[35:52] that when God calls,
[35:55] he not looking at what maybe the people
[36:01] naturally may look
[36:03] at because of a status or because of
[36:06] maybe your position.
[36:11] But God before the foundation of the
[36:14] world already know who all was going to
[36:17] come. Amen.
[36:20] As prophet God said if one play he said
[36:22] he said there is no way a person can
[36:25] come to God except he has been
[36:28] predestinated by God to come. That's
[36:31] right. Amen. Well, we hear a lot of time
[36:34] people say, "Well, you try to invite
[36:36] them to maybe to church or give them an
[36:39] invitation or witness them about the
[36:41] things of God and sometime you hear so
[36:44] well I come when I get
[36:47] ready." Well, I'm sorry. You
[36:49] might, but it won't be God calling
[36:53] you. You can't come to God when you get
[36:57] ready.
[37:00] When you That's what I say. the day that
[37:02] you hear his voice. True. Amen. And when
[37:05] you hear God's voice, you can't just
[37:09] resist that voice.
[37:13] Cuz even that voice of God, even if you
[37:16] not really recognizing it's the voice of
[37:18] God, it will do something to you.
[37:25] It will change your course,
[37:29] Lord. Amen. I I I knew what it did to
[37:32] me.
[37:36] His voice. He said, "My sheep."
[37:40] So only the sheep can actually hear his
[37:45] voice. Amen.
[37:48] And you don't hear it with your natural
[37:50] ears either.
[37:53] This hearing come from within you.
[37:59] And you only can respond to what's in
[38:03] you to accept what you hear even though
[38:08] you may can't understand it. Amen. I
[38:11] very doubt anybody ever called by God
[38:14] fully understand what is this about.
[38:18] But by faith you begin to move on it.
[38:24] Oh Lord. See, faith is a
[38:27] unconscious walking with
[38:30] God. Not really know where it's taking
[38:32] you, not really know what it's all
[38:35] about. But there's something in you
[38:37] begin to respond to what you hear.
[38:42] No preacher can put that in you. That
[38:45] has to be there before the foundation of
[38:47] the world.
[38:51] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, help us.
[38:54] I'm excited. Thank you. Not only am I
[38:57] excited, but I'm stirred because of what
[39:02] I believe that God is is bringing us to.
[39:07] And what he has giving us, his word in
[39:10] his hour,
[39:12] that word is a word of preparation.
[39:16] Amen.
[39:20] It's supposed to be preparing
[39:25] us for the second coming of
[39:29] Christ. I I wonder sometime do we fully
[39:33] understand this? This is not a church
[39:37] gathering of just coming to a building
[39:40] and Lord help us this hour putting our
[39:43] name on a on on a outside a
[39:47] message but this is actually coming back
[39:51] to God himself.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:59] You know, I'm learning I'm
[40:02] learning I'm learning some
[40:05] things and I I want to say something but
[40:09] not being
[40:11] critical. A lot of times that people
[40:17] think that if they
[40:20] uh this a humanistic part of people.
[40:23] They think that because of uh what
[40:27] church you think is more
[40:30] revalent to prepare you for the coming
[40:33] of
[40:34] Christ. We begin to just run all over
[40:38] the place.
[40:41] But you still won't find God there.
[40:44] That's true. Amenless.
[40:47] You will find God right where you left
[40:49] them at. Amen. Come on. Go.
[40:53] There isn't no certain Excuse me. There
[40:57] isn't no certain preacher can make you
[41:00] ready for the coming of the Lord. Bible
[41:03] say his wife she made her
[41:07] self. Other words, she knew what it's
[41:10] going to take. Amen. To prepare her for
[41:15] this coming. So, she began to diligently
[41:19] seek God on her own by revelation
[41:24] because she understand that this is a
[41:27] personal revelation of God and you
[41:30] alone.
[41:33] Oh my.
[41:40] We're in the closing of the hours
[41:43] now. We're in harvest
[41:46] time. And every seed must bring
[41:50] forth of a kind that it
[41:57] is. God in his
[42:00] own season, in his own time. I like the
[42:04] way that how God don't just allow things
[42:07] to
[42:10] transpire and the way that the people be
[42:12] looking at
[42:13] it, you know, and how sometime that we
[42:16] think that sometimes we already have it
[42:20] all and and these kind of things and
[42:23] then we find out that yet there's more.
[42:26] Amen. Amen. There is more that God is
[42:31] requiring of us.
[42:38] Yes, he
[42:40] called. And if you actually the chosen
[42:43] of God, you been busy seeking and and
[42:47] and crying out, "Lord, what must I do?"
[42:51] Yes.
[42:53] There's no time to be looking around
[42:54] what somebody else is doing no more. I
[42:56] tell them a lot of time I said I don't
[42:58] have time to get involved in to what
[43:01] everybody else is. I must stay focused.
[43:05] I don't have time as brother Ernest say
[43:08] distractions that the devil always
[43:11] giving the the the believers something
[43:14] to get their attention on what really
[43:17] matters.
[43:19] Not that he think is important, but
[43:21] there ought to be nothing so important
[43:23] that take your mind off of God. Amen.
[43:26] Amen. Amen.
[43:29] I was going to deal with that that woman
[43:32] in the
[43:33] Bible and she had lost one of her
[43:37] coins off of her
[43:40] tablet and her husband was getting ready
[43:43] to
[43:45] come and she didn't want her husband to
[43:47] find her one of those corner. It was it
[43:50] it's a message that it would have said
[43:52] that she wasn't true to her vows.
[43:56] And God say she swept that
[44:00] house. She tore it
[44:03] up. Why? Because she knew that she would
[44:07] be marked as a ill-famed person.
[44:13] The servant of God says that the church
[44:16] done lost all its virtues.
[44:22] He said it's time for us to get
[44:26] sweeping. Whatever we have lost as
[44:31] Christians, it's time we begin to get
[44:34] desperate about Lord, my prayer life has
[44:37] went away. Amen.
[44:42] It is it's a I know it's a spirit that
[44:44] done actually swept
[44:48] everywhere that you know it used to be a
[44:51] time that we knew that coming to the
[44:54] house of God was important.
[44:58] Now we use God as a
[45:01] convenience. When it's convenient for me
[45:04] to
[45:05] come, I'll come.
[45:08] And the pastor, he
[45:11] understands. Yes, he does. He
[45:14] understands that he can't make you do
[45:18] anything. We are only to present to you
[45:21] the things that God has given us. You
[45:24] know, that's going to prepare you, but
[45:27] it's up to you as an individual what you
[45:31] do with it. Amen.
[45:36] And I understand it take God to do those
[45:38] things.
[45:40] It actually takes a stirring of God to
[45:44] get the people back desperate again.
[45:48] Amen. That they'll understand this world
[45:51] is gone. Amen.
[45:53] She's doomed. I don't care what career
[45:56] you choose. I don't care what your goal
[45:59] and have it. But keep your focus on the
[46:03] coming of the Lord. Amen. Don't get
[46:06] sidetracked off money.
[46:10] Amen.
[46:13] Lord have mercy.
[46:15] Money don't become people of
[46:19] God. You know, because when you got
[46:21] money, you can almost they think you can
[46:22] buy your way
[46:26] in. You know, people go build their own
[46:29] church. They're going to start whatever
[46:31] they want to. They take it as, hey, you
[46:34] know, I can jump in it whenever, you
[46:36] know, come to church every 8 months, 6
[46:39] months, you know, when I feel like it,
[46:41] at my convenience. And y'all will be
[46:43] glad to see
[46:46] me because I mean
[46:48] church. But let me tell you, God don't
[46:51] look at it that way.
[46:53] The way we look at it and the way God
[46:55] look at it is different. Amen.
[46:58] And God don't push to make you or to
[47:02] force you to get yourself ready. Here he
[47:06] said that he had prepared everything.
[47:11] Everything we have need of is here
[47:15] already.
[47:18] The opening of the book, yes Jesus, made
[47:22] known to us the thing that God had hid
[47:25] before the furnace of the world. Now he
[47:27] has released those things.
[47:30] So if the book is a open book then why
[47:34] are we not preparing like we alter?
[47:36] Amen.
[47:42] I really believe
[47:44] this Lord help us to get to that
[47:47] place that when it strikes
[47:50] us that the coming of the Lord is closer
[47:54] than we thought.
[47:57] And I know that's going to be an
[47:59] individual thing that God does in each
[48:02] and every one of us. The true
[48:06] church when that true church really
[48:09] understand by revelation that you know
[48:12] I've got to be about my father's
[48:14] business.
[48:16] I don't have time to be running here and
[48:19] running there. I must know what I'm
[48:21] doing. That is the Lord that's directing
[48:24] me. Amen.
[48:29] I don't have time to be running from
[48:30] pillar to post wondering what this got,
[48:34] wondering what. Let me tell you
[48:35] something. God got everything you need.
[48:38] I say God got everything you need.
[48:44] So don't depend on anybody else. You
[48:48] seek God. Amen.
[48:53] You know, it's hard. I understand some
[48:56] now, brother, to get grown
[48:59] people to
[49:02] understand the preparation of God and
[49:05] what they must be doing.
[49:08] One of the most I be the
[49:11] essential things that we must
[49:15] know that we got
[49:19] oil. Without
[49:22] that you can know all the mysteries and
[49:24] you can know all the
[49:27] thunders but without that new
[49:31] birth without oil in your vessel sister
[49:36] and brother you can even live clean
[49:39] sanctified lives.
[49:42] Matthew
[49:44] 25 10 virgins clean
[49:48] people wouldn't do anything but fire was
[49:51] liking
[49:53] oil. They were going in the
[49:56] message. They didn't go along to meet
[49:58] the bridegroom but it when he slumbered
[50:02] and
[50:03] slept say they all did. When that alarm
[50:07] went off the bride coming, the five
[50:10] wives rose cuz they had extra oil.
[50:16] They just didn't go to church for deep
[50:21] sermons, but they began to cry out to
[50:24] God, "Lord, I need a
[50:27] refilling." Lord,
[50:30] Lord have mercy. That didn't went away
[50:33] from the churches down there, you know.
[50:36] They think they need more
[50:39] mysteries. They don't know that they
[50:41] need fire. They need oil.
[50:47] They do just like those five wise a
[50:49] foolish virgin. They get to the very end
[50:52] and realize,
[50:54] "Oh, can I get some of
[50:57] yours?" And they tell, "No, go by for
[51:01] yourself." And they went, they get it.
[51:04] So while they went, guess what happened?
[51:08] The bron came.
[51:10] And those clean living people didn't
[51:14] make it in the rapture.
[51:17] Can you imagine doing all these other
[51:20] thing living clean and paying tithe and
[51:23] coming to church and yet have no oil?
[51:27] Wow.
[51:30] that would make us
[51:33] cry, know all the mysteries of
[51:36] God, yet didn't get the Holy
[51:42] Ghost. I was telling the people back
[51:46] home, you know, I tell them
[51:50] this. I like that brother always used to
[51:53] tell us long years ago way back in ' 87
[51:58] 89 above anything you get be sure you
[52:01] got the Holy Ghost.
[52:03] [Music]
[52:04] Amen. If you don't know one
[52:07] quotation, but if you get the Holy
[52:12] Ghost, if you get that
[52:16] giver of that
[52:18] word and get him personally for
[52:21] yourself, get a in other words, get a
[52:24] personalized experience with God
[52:29] yourself. Don't rely on buddies. Don't
[52:32] rely on preachers. Don't don't rely on
[52:34] this. rely only upon God.
[52:42] Most the heartbreakst thing I notice
[52:45] that most a pastor do when he have
[52:50] labored diligently before God to get a
[52:53] word from
[52:55] God cuz he's concerned about the souls
[52:58] of the people. That that's all it's
[53:00] about. I told one brother that the other
[53:02] day because they're console about the
[53:06] souls of the people and they don't want
[53:09] to see
[53:10] nobody left
[53:13] out. But if they don't want
[53:19] it, how bad do we want
[53:23] it? And see, when you want something bad
[53:25] enough, then you know that it's a price.
[53:32] Do you have to
[53:33] pay? And nobody can make you do
[53:37] that. You have to get a personalized
[53:40] stirring in your soul. And Lord,
[53:42] whatever it takes,
[53:46] whatever I must do, Lord, help me to do
[53:49] that.
[53:56] Hard to get them to pray.
[53:59] prayer
[54:01] service the most
[54:04] missed and I will be the one that needed
[54:06] the most be the one that don't never
[54:08] show
[54:11] up got things in their life going on got
[54:14] demonic spirits that's attacking them
[54:17] they need spiritual
[54:18] breakthroughs and every prayer night
[54:20] there they got a another place it said
[54:23] here in another writing or something
[54:25] like this it said that they made
[54:30] excuses. Excuse I got to go get a wife.
[54:35] I got to go get a
[54:37] job. It always something else. They got
[54:40] to do more
[54:42] important. This is what I tell me. I
[54:45] said I don't come wake nobody up to go
[54:47] to work on
[54:49] Monday, but I guarantee you you get
[54:52] up. Why? Because it's important to you.
[54:57] That boss man, he don't come to your
[54:58] house to wake you up. And you know if
[55:01] you call in too many sick time, you
[55:04] won't even be there much
[55:08] longer. But because God
[55:12] longsuffering, we can do him any kind of
[55:15] way. That's right. Which we ought not to
[55:18] do him like that.
[55:22] But yet because of the slopeess of the
[55:25] people and that mind setting, they just
[55:28] can't seem to grasp it. Without God, I
[55:30] won't even be able to get up. Amen.
[55:35] In other words, I won't be able to go to
[55:36] the job that I'm talking about going to
[55:39] if God don't wake me up. Amen.
[55:45] Lord help
[55:48] us
[55:50] making
[55:52] yourself
[55:54] ready. It's our own personal
[55:59] responsibility. It's not up to the
[56:01] pastor to make us ready. He has a part
[56:05] to do to get the word from the God and
[56:07] be able to give it to us. But what you
[56:10] do with it after you hear the word,
[56:13] that's on you.
[56:17] And only those that really fully
[56:21] understand, even with what's going on
[56:23] now in our economy and going on history,
[56:27] prophecy, seeing the things, you know,
[56:30] just materializing right before our
[56:32] eyes. You know what? Yeah.
[56:34] Well, we get st two, three days, we're
[56:37] right back to normal.
[56:41] because we don't seek
[56:43] out to find out what is all this really
[56:47] about and what connection does there
[56:50] have to do with
[56:52] me. I said I'm going to go back home and
[56:54] I'm going try to have a little study a
[56:57] little inquisiting time because you I
[57:00] found out by some you think people know
[57:02] these things they used
[57:05] to. They don't even know what the image
[57:07] of the beast
[57:11] is because the devil had done them
[57:13] bombarded our mind so much and given us
[57:16] so much
[57:17] materialistic
[57:19] goods. Lord have
[57:22] mercy. All we want to do is gain. Get
[57:25] get you got still want more. Get get.
[57:30] And know that the very thing you get is
[57:32] sucking the very life of God out of you.
[57:36] You know what causes most people not to
[57:38] come to the house of God? Materialistic
[57:41] things. They work so hard,
[57:46] labor, so diligently. Why not put that
[57:50] laboring to
[57:54] Christ? We It's hard to get people even
[57:57] to witnessing
[57:59] anymore. Witness. What is that? That's a
[58:02] foreign language.
[58:06] tell somebody about the second coming of
[58:09] the
[58:10] Lord. But then you know what I find out?
[58:13] If you don't know really what it's
[58:15] about, it hard for you to tell anybody
[58:17] else about it. True. Amen. Because when
[58:20] you read about it stirs you, hey y'all,
[58:24] we see current events made clear through
[58:27] prophecy.
[58:28] We see we wreck at the
[58:31] breaking of this ecumenical council
[58:34] movement and confederation of
[58:37] churches that everything is coming
[58:41] together a uniting
[58:44] time a one world religion
[58:49] system and what we going to be doing
[58:51] during that time I don't
[58:54] know Lord help
[58:58] Yes, I'm closing the Come
[59:02] on. Prepare
[59:05] yourself. Don't wait for nobody else.
[59:08] Prepare
[59:10] yourself. Understand what you must be
[59:14] doing as a Christian.
[59:16] Let's stop waiting till something
[59:19] happen, but let's start making it
[59:21] happen.
[59:23] God bless you tonight.
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:30] Praise the Lord. Praise the
[59:34] Lord. Appreciate the word tonight. Amen.
[59:37] I'm just saying I was just listening to
[59:39] the prophet on message one more time
[59:42] just once
[59:44] more. And he says he keep stressing and
[59:49] every message I listen to is stressing
[59:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You know,
[59:54] if we think about the great mysteries in
[59:56] the message, very seldom he
[1:00:00] even his his stress was on the baptism
[1:00:03] of the Holy Ghost. You listen to the
[1:00:05] message, just listen to one message
[1:00:07] after another, his stress is on you
[1:00:10] getting the Holy Ghost. And I just I I
[1:00:13] just said we listen to message after
[1:00:14] message and his stress is the baptism of
[1:00:17] the Holy
[1:00:19] Ghost but people put emphasis on other
[1:00:22] things but I it's very important just
[1:00:26] once more. He wants to see revival in
[1:00:29] the church. Wants to see the power of
[1:00:30] God in the church. Just once more Lord
[1:00:33] that's what I want. Want to see your
[1:00:36] power manifested. Want to see your glory
[1:00:38] in the church Lord. Just once more,
[1:00:42] Lord.
[1:00:44] Amen. I think
[1:00:47] sometimes Samson lost his strength.
[1:00:50] Amen. Are you with me? Samson had lost
[1:00:53] his strength to havage
[1:00:55] cut. People lose
[1:00:58] holiness. They leave. They lose the
[1:01:01] sense of spiritual
[1:01:05] guidance. They lose it. The anointing is
[1:01:08] not there. The power of God is not being
[1:01:13] manifested. Thank the Lord for brother
[1:01:15] Jimmy coming by.
[1:01:17] Amen. Stressing. Amen. Praise God. We
[1:01:20] need the gifts. We need the power of
[1:01:22] God. We need to see God in action. Amen.
[1:01:25] Amen.
[1:01:28] He's talking about in the acts of the
[1:01:30] Holy Ghost.
[1:01:34] Said when you see that prophet come
[1:01:38] out of
[1:01:40] America.
[1:01:42] Amen. That was ex Yeah. Huh? See that
[1:01:47] pope come out of out of America.
[1:01:51] Amen. Pope coming out of America.
[1:01:55] Amen. So, by the grace of God, watch
[1:01:58] out. We can see this thing coming
[1:02:00] together so fast. Shoot. Y'all see how
[1:02:03] CO hit us like that and the whole world
[1:02:06] was shut down? The
[1:02:10] commen. And I I I want I want to get
[1:02:14] with y'all again and show y'all what
[1:02:17] happened when the Lord let us come was
[1:02:21] introduced to the to the message of the
[1:02:23] hour. and what how Colombia got stirred
[1:02:25] and how South Carolina got stirred and
[1:02:28] all these churches came came
[1:02:31] about because sometimes
[1:02:34] folks forgotten that we had to the
[1:02:39] world it was the greatest ecumenical
[1:02:42] move the world has ever known was in the
[1:02:44] city of
[1:02:47] Colombia and Pope visit was the capstone
[1:02:50] of the ecumenical move. So that's why so
[1:02:54] many people came to the
[1:02:56] message. That's why so many people
[1:02:58] because they were seeing modern events
[1:03:01] made clear by prophecy. They were seeing
[1:03:03] those things manifested before the eyes.
[1:03:06] So the people were
[1:03:07] running to the message. I believe once
[1:03:10] again God can do it again. Because this
[1:03:14] thing here going to happen so
[1:03:16] quick. Praise God.
[1:03:19] It's going to be quick. If you're not
[1:03:22] in, you won't be able to get in. I was
[1:03:24] just listening to the prophet. He said,
[1:03:25] "If the door shut, you can't get in."
[1:03:29] Amen. He that holy, he said, "Let it be
[1:03:31] holy still." I know that's what the
[1:03:32] Bible said, too. But it was putting that
[1:03:35] special emphasis that the door be
[1:03:40] shut. And when that door is
[1:03:43] shut, praise God, it's all over then.
[1:03:47] And I said to come in that to that time
[1:03:49] when the door is going to be
[1:03:52] shut. Gentile time will be over. God
[1:03:56] will return back to the
[1:03:58] Jews. I was hearing just before I came
[1:04:01] to the church, they putting uh they're
[1:04:03] going to have a big move with Jews and
[1:04:07] the Protestants over in Jerusalem or
[1:04:09] something.
[1:04:12] I said they trying to do
[1:04:15] something and you know people so happy
[1:04:19] about this folk out of the US something
[1:04:22] to be proud about everybody happy happy
[1:04:25] happy people they can smile amen thank
[1:04:29] the Lord that's a good thing maybe to a
[1:04:33] lot of folks it's a nice thing not
[1:04:36] saying anything against the the man
[1:04:38] himself
[1:04:41] But before that happened that morning I
[1:04:44] read my morning scripture and it says
[1:04:48] and Satan
[1:04:50] having entered into Judas's scariot
[1:04:56] Judas surname is carried like that I
[1:05:00] said Satan entered into him at an
[1:05:02] appointed time and then that later that
[1:05:06] day I said God Is this by
[1:05:12] coincidence? Amen. We know that will
[1:05:14] happen in the end
[1:05:16] time.
[1:05:18] Amen. That Satan would enter into a man
[1:05:22] and that man would become the beast. Are
[1:05:25] y'all with me?
[1:05:30] God is doing
[1:05:32] something. When God is on the move, the
[1:05:35] enemy is getting on the move. Yes, sir.
[1:05:37] Are you with me? Yes, sir. To try to
[1:05:39] forrun the move of God. A lot of things
[1:05:43] he the prophet said, "Don't speak it.
[1:05:46] Let's just let God do it." Because if
[1:05:48] you speak it, he'll get a hold to it and
[1:05:51] do everything he can do to stop it.
[1:05:54] Amen.
[1:05:56] I said, "A lot of folks, it's like they
[1:05:58] had dreams and prophecies going forth on
[1:06:01] this church, but we spoke it. The devil
[1:06:05] do everything he do can do to destroy,
[1:06:08] you
[1:06:09] know, stop it. I'm not going to let it
[1:06:12] happen. But if if the prophecies are
[1:06:15] true, if the dreams are true, praise
[1:06:20] God, God's going to do what he's going
[1:06:22] to do." Amen. Praise
[1:06:25] God. God will do what he said. And I we
[1:06:30] got to be uh we got to know that if God
[1:06:34] going to do exactly what he said he'll
[1:06:37] do and you had to hold firm and be
[1:06:41] steadfast. Amen. Because if we look at
[1:06:43] what we see, Amen. then you'll say you

[1:10:15] towards the mark to the prize of the
[1:10:17] high calling of God in
[1:10:21] Christ. Let us do that. Lord, let this
[1:10:24] little church do that.
