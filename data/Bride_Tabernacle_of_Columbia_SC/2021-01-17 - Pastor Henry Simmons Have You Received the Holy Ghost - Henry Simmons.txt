where is [Music] is [Music] a wonderful work in power in the blood of the lamb again we thank god for everyone to press your way out this morning and those that are listening in praise god that god will send the power we want to look this morning at the book of acts 19 chapter god is good his mercy is everlasting his truth endures let us just stand in the reading of the word acts 19 and 1 it says and it came to pass that while polos with that conrent paul having passed through the upper course came to ephesus finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believe and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto john into john's baptism then said paul john very baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men there were about twelve maybe by heads father we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you for lord god this state that you have made lord i ask you to look upon those on the prayer list lord and father the different needs lord our brother robert and jocelyn and lord our sister johnson and father i pray you look upon our society mainly get this morning god you touch her father and the different ones that act for prayer god is so many names and so many situations and conditions lord but lord you able to meet those conditions lord our sister shema lord god i ask you to touch her god today lord and i ask you to give us strength lord and bless our father in the name of jesus christ for we look to you now bless the word as it come forth may it be full for our soul in jesus name amen we thank god i was just out here praying early this morning and as i was out here praying i was just rejoicing and i tell you i was just speaking a little in tongues and prophesying a little and i said i wish i could just turn the uh record on and i could just play it back what i was listening to because i was just enjoying the lord amen and the things that he was speaking to my spirit now i certainly were enjoying was enjoying it i'm glad to see charity this morning god bless you charity amen thank the lord for each and every one again uh here we're in acts the 19 chapter and it talks about have you received the holy ghost since you bleed i don't perhaps i won't preach this morning just talk to you a little bit i find that the greatest need and the greatest problem in the church is the people as a whole have not received the baptism of the holy ghost sometimes they're preachers sometimes they're deacons sometimes they've been in the church for years 20 30 40 years and have not received the holy ghost you know it's something about thinking that you have it believing that you have it but you really don't have it the thing is the question is have you received it and if if not do you want it now the holy ghost is not just a thing as a feeling it's not just an imaginary thing the holy ghost is actually jesus when he was going away he said i will not leave you comfortless but i will come to you he said i'm with you but i shall be in you the holy ghost is not a thing but the holy ghost is a person and it's this jesus that walked the shows of galilee the one that died on the cross and all that same jesus that was in flesh which was a word made flesh that same jesus was to go back to the father and he was going to send back the comforter and that comfortable would it would be the life that was in the blood that created jesus christ the father of jesus christ which was the spirit the bible said when mary conceived the holy ghost overshadowed mary and she was and it said the holy thing which is in you it was the creation of the beginning of the creation of god where god became flesh god became a man but the holy spirit was the one that created the egg and the seed so the holy ghost was the father that same holy ghost in making you and i sons and daughters of god that same holy ghost had overshot of mary that she was able to concede and bring forth jesus christ is the same holy ghost that god wants to come down and impregnate us with him that we can have jesus in us are you with me so he wants we want jesus as married a man carried a physical body we carry a spiritual amen jesus the very life amen of god in our bodies now it's up to us amen while we are actually amen impregnated or will spirit fill amen the holy ghost shall lead us guide us unto all truth amen he is the one that leads in god and he's the one that wants preeminence in our lives he wants to be in control of us that he can lead us not just to amen a promised land like it was in uh in the book or or or exodus amen but god wants to lead us not to a place like joshua took them to canaan but god wants to lead us to glory amen and god wants us to enter into a kingdom uh an invisible kingdom amen that we might be amen have an invisible union with god amen god through the holy ghost amen wants to make you and i one amen for the purpose was the eve was to bring reproduce adam and the purpose of the bride the church is to reproduce christ amen the purpose of the wife and the husband coming together the broad tree is to bring forth fruit are you with me he said that your fruits may remain hope i didn't get too far but have you received the holy ghost since you believe because sometimes it's just an imagination sometimes it's a good feeling when the feeling is over amen we're still our same old same old amen and we don't want to see the old man and you know we use a little for a little sub topic renewed in the spirit now some i i'm not saying that you don't have the holy ghost and i'm not saying i'm saying sometimes we need to be restored or renewed in the spirit sometimes they call it a refilling of the spirit because sometimes things happen in life and amen and sometimes we go through they met some bad places sometimes and sometimes things happen to knock us down and amen but we have to get up sometimes this confession and repentance have to take place in our lives we have to confess and understand or amen that we have fallen amen sometimes we fall away from grace and and we need the grace of god to be restored in our lives sometimes things hinder us in our spirit but the holy ghost he said have you received the holy ghost tonight since you believe now it's very important because most people in most churches most preachers teach that when you believe that you're born again and that you have the holy ghost when you believe when you accept jesus as your personal savior they teach you that you're born again and you have the spirit of god okay but the question was acts of of the disciples at this time he said in the second verse he said unto them have you have ye received the holy ghost what he did not take away and tell them that they were not believers what happens a lot of time in the apostolic faith and those that believe in the oneness of god and the baptism of in the world in the name of jesus christ oftentimes they tell people that they're not believers and jesus never told them because amen they didn't have the holy ghost that they were not believers but he said have you received the holy ghost since ye believe are you with me uh i'm saying i acknowledge the fact that you are believable but have you received the holy ghost now we understand that some people the reason why they conduct their lives in certain ways but they really love god and believe god but they conduct their lives it's not in the beauty of holiness it's not a sanctified life a lot of times it's not a clean living person they can curse a little bit drink a little bit run around a little bit and do all kind of stuff but they can come to church and say i believe i'm a believer why because i confess jesus christ as my personal savior and he's come into my life and i am a believer i i love the lord no question many times that's the truth but it's also he said if you love me keep my commandments are you with me see uh uh uh sometimes we we have to go a little farther than just saying i'm a believer we got to keep the commandment we got to keep the word but how can we keep the word amen when we don't have the keeper in us amen it's impossible for us to keep the word without the people in us without the one that's gonna keep you from falling you need the holy ghost to keep you from falling okay now let me just look at uh acts 18 and 24 it says and a certain jew named apollos born of alexandra an eloquent man and what he was mighty he was what mighty in the scripture you know came to ephesus this man instructed was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent into what you cannot say this man amen didn't know nothing this man was uh amen eloquently this man knew the word and you couldn't say the man that was not anointed you know you got a lot of folk that don't have no anointing in their life and they go out condemn people because they know one little point more than the other and they so busy condemning that man but instead of uh a condemning the man i believe a quill and priscilla seller recognized amen that this man amen had a gift and god was using this man and they wanted to help this man and amen and acknowledge the fact that this man was very gifted and this man really amen was showing the people amen uh that jesus was lord and that's something brother sister because some people today don't know that jesus is lord and the bible said no man can say to jesus the lord but by the holy ghost so somewhere along the line that man had got a revelation and he had gotten in touch with god in some kind of way but he oh lord sometimes we try we're so busy trying to take away from folks some people they just live like they got it all and they got to take something away from a man and instead of trying to give somebody something they are so busy condemning to that it makes them a very sad creature some people can't be happy because they're so busy on the condemning side and all times trying to find some kind of fault in somebody amen that's a miserable life to live that you go to church you find fault you they may go to work you find fault amen everywhere you look you find fault in everybody but you amen everybody amen uh uh somebody close to you somebody you think amen is one of yours other than that you find fault amen you look at them and this ain't right and that ain't right and this ain't right and uh and just spend all your lifetime just finding fault instead of amen come in oh amen god bless you my brother god bless you my sister ain't god good brother amen god is so wonderful real servant a good god oh no uh have you heard the ladies and gossip do you know what happened to sister sue and brother uh oh kingfish you know what i'm saying brother sister folks are so busy in other folks business and other folks matter amen until instead of trying to encourage folk they are condemning for instead of saying pastor i really enjoyed that message truly it was a blessing this morning he said what in the word a pastor trying to say he missed out on so and so you know instead of seeing the good in a person there are folks that come to church to find evil and all kind of critical amen but if they would only examine their own self and see whether or not they're in the faith and start critic or oh they take constructive criticism amen the bible said examine yourself and see whether or not you are in the faith amen the bible search me oh lord touch my heart and you know i'm out here crying out lord touch me lord try my rain lord i'm not worthy i'm not worthy of your mercy i'm not worthy of your goodness i'm not worthy to stand up here amen and try to tell you what's right do you think that i'm so good that i have a right to do that but it's by the grace of god i am what i am it's only by the grace of god amen and i thank god for his grace this morning and each and every one of us ought to thank god for the grace of god amen not that we are not holy now but god's grace is upon our lives here it says the bible says he said fervent in the spirit of man and speak and talk deal into the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john some folk all they know is the baptism in the name of the father son holy ghost that's all they know but what they do know and that baptism in the name of the father son holy ghost they are sometimes they are very knowledgeable and well learned men knowing that this uh alexander was a very taught and well-learned eloquent man but he didn't know see like a lot of folk don't know that father is not a name you know you know he went to school in new england better than i myself i believe that man knew our english better than priscilla and aquila i believe that man was more more intelligent than they were but it was a revelation that god had given in that age at that recycle a particular time that he had not received as yet and they didn't come with a proud spirit hey you don't know what i know you know how some folk take it you going to hell i look at you i know you ain't right because you don't know what i know oh can't you see how mean some folks are yeah you know you know got a little apostolic preacher that comes on and he condemns everybody think you know if god just shined a light on him for about two minutes all that bigness and badness and make people think well he's saying a lot of the right things it mean the right way but it's a way the bible says speak the truth in love are you with me you can have truth but you don't have no love with him and you do more damage than you're doing good and what are you doing you're producing a lot of meaningful and those mean folklore amen go out and express it like you express it and cause a lot of folk that would have believed they don't believe because you got mean folk out there trying to tell folks something and folks the kind of religion the kind of god that you got i don't want him are you with me see you want god to be easily with love and kindness have i drawn you you want a god that amen that you that that's really reaching out his hand and love and amen and showing amen that he cares about you amen and he loves you now i i care about you i know you got fault maybe jesus would have came to the woman at the well and said a woman you ain't no good you need to repent got all these husband and shacking up a woman you ain't no good you need to get yourself right you know you know some of us are man i ain't got time for that kind of person you see what kind of punches you but jesus took time out to send the disciples away because he knew that they wouldn't understand y'all go and go buy me something send them away because they ain't gonna they ain't gonna understand they ain't gonna have no compassion on this woman but jesus knew what time the woman was gonna come and he had need to go by samara you see what i'm saying and i'm saying jesus amen amen cannot use you to reach that one to have a need in their life because you've gotten so high-minded and so holy that you don't understand how to have compassion are you with me but you and i must have compassion amen we all going to make mistakes in this life we're going to say something or do something that we have no business saying or doing but one thing about it we understand amen that god is a mercy for god and god will forgive us and god would help us amen if we only repent be renewed in your spirit brother sister it says here i got to go on because i i don't know where i got that from and because i tried to be simple and plain and just go through this little simple subject okay it says here and he speak boldly in this and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took unto him and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly see sometimes you can't just stand up in front of a person and try to make them look bad because you know something they don't know on the job or in the school or somewhere and you see the person and you know how some folk they see a person that don't look like them and they say oh what and they start preaching on them and they'll start talking about them and they'll start in their mind you know like jesus amen the woman was washing his feet with his hair and uh she was a prostitute and maybe got that money to buy that all he meant through her prostitution but she was anointing his feet with all and simon in his and all his religious buddies looking at that woman and said you know this man supposed to be a prophet and supposed to be knowing a holy man and if he if he'd have known what kind of woman that was stooping down there and kissing his feet and washing it he look at him but he said simon since the time i came into your house you didn't greet me with a kiss and you didn't uh give me no water to wash my feet that's the thing you do in those days but this woman since the time she came in cease not to kiss my feet and anoint him amen this woman he said now wherever the gospel is preached i want this woman to be in knowledge are you with me so jesus took the time out to all the critical spirits and that's what i'm saying instead of being critics now it's time to shut up amen and and be renewed in your spirit and get the baptism of the holy ghost it's time to stop all this criticizing amen because it's not doing you any good amen you know i was going to talk about let me just go and skip over of polos and let me go on get with i want to say like the old people said uh psalms 51. let's get down to business a little bit but i don't want to say what the old folks said because it might not be proper to sit in the pool pier let's go and get down to this point amen one of the points when we're dealing with being renewed in the spirit because a lot of people don't know re reno renewing and restoring comes with an acknowledgement it comes with confession it comes with an understanding that somewhere along the line something has caused our spirit to be contaminated or dirty amen see david understood that his spirit was not clean he said uh uh wash me with his that i might be clean i i'm dirty and brother and sister when when you dirty and when you filthy you're not happy you know why you see so many christians unhappy because it's some kind of dirt it's in their life and i i hear david in psalms 51 had committed adultery and had taken you rod's wife and and he had uh taken the shiva and he had he had done a bad thing and that bad thing i i can see david going into the house of the lord and i can see him always he had to deal with that in the in his mind and in his spirit in time past you know i i i i took and i put the man on the front line i took and i killed uh had the man killed and i took his wife oh just think how david must have felt when he went to the church and he heard the word and he still tried to praise the lord you know how we try to praise the lord but something ain't right we're trying to hallelujah oh lord oh you're trying to convince yourself that you really love really holy lord i love you and god says you got to get it right you need see god sent a prophet to david david he knew david amen couldn't he just couldn't get it fixed right he just couldn't do it so god had to send nathan on and tell david about this man that had just one wee lamb and the other had a whole bunch and he took the man one wee lamb are you with me and david looked at a a man that would do such a thing he said that man ought to die you know what i'm saying and nathan told david you're the man you know sometimes we find out amen that it's us amen that our problem is not exterior but it's inter you know your problem is not see what happens in the garden adam said his problem was the woman you gave me isn't that right the woman said it was the devil the serpent amen brother and sister when you get to the root of the matter you made your own decision are you with me you the condition that you're in is because you made your own decisions don't blame your husband don't blame your wife don't blame uh uh the preacher don't pray yo okay it's on 51 he says here and um 10. he said create in me or what i believe sometimes we need a clean heart a clean heart now somehow our heart has gotten dirty he said blessed are the meek for they shouldn't hurt blessing to them that moan for they shall be confident are you with me blessed are the pew and hard for they shall see god does your heart peel uh are you one of those ones that see everybody else's being unpeeled see david had to examine himself and he had to look at himself i'm looking at me i y'all yes i know stories to tell about everybody but look at me so he says here creating me a clean heart and he said oh god and renew what renew a right spirit with me you know they sing a song give me a heart like this lord i want a heart like yours how just what kind of heart does god have just look at you and and regardless of what you've done and the way you've lived look what kind of heart he had he had a heart for you he cared about you and he reached down his hand he said regardless of what you've done and how you live i still love you and i died for you come on brother sister i forgive you but you're holding back on somebody you've forgotten that you were purged you've forgotten how much god forgave you of are you with me instead of reaching out to somebody you're looking down on folk amen because you don't made it brother and sister we need to come on back home maybe david was trying to get away from his situation but he recognized i got to face the fact that i've done wrong so he says cast me not away from thy presence and take not thou what he realized that he he valued the spirit of god he and he knew it was holy and amen and he knew that because it was the holy spirit he said don't take it away from me god i want it i want the holy ghost don't take it away from me lord you see what i'm saying you got to want to have the holy ghost amen you know you can't conduct your life a certain way by doing certain ungodly thing with the holy ghost if you value the holy ghost and you want the holy ghost to always be with you always to be will in you he said i'll never leave you neither will i he said greater is he that's what in you than he that is in the world god wants to love you with the everlasting oh hallelujah oh the love of god is more precious than anything oh nobody can love you like god hallelujah he'll be there for you when you're going through your worst times when you're going through your down time when you're going through your troubles i'll be with you i won't leave you i won't forsake you amen you run out of money you go through a hard time forget about you god won't forget you he won't forsake you when you're going through hard and difficult times god will still be there david said when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord would take me the lord won't do it amen god will be their father brother amen amen the pastor might forget the call you'll forget to call your name forget to say anything about all amen the wonderful thing that you do but god won't forget your labor love that you've done towards his name he'll never forget you amen so don't worry about it payday you'll come after a while amen you may not get it on that side nobody might recognize you on this side but on the other side there's a crown of glory waiting on you god got a blessing waiting on your brother so say amen he knows your hurt knows your pain but blessings are waiting on you he kept in store amen for them to love him god got a blessing he's gonna reward you he's gonna do right praise god i can try to do my best and still don't come up the path amen i can try to do all i can still i'll leave somebody out are you with me praise god a parent can do all they can reading the children and still amen they have not i met that every need that the child or the children have sometimes they look at my mama would only done that and my dad would only did this of our own let this now all in that you did the best that you could your best wasn't good enough sometimes are you with me praise god you can try to be the best wife and the best husband and the best mother and the best diet but sometimes your best ain't good enough they meant sometimes the child will still go down the wrong path and go down their own way but you're doing your best amen let god do the rest are you with me so you got to know that you got a god that can do the rest amen here we are he says in the 12th verse she said renew restore unto me the what see you got to realize that something is missing amen i wish everybody in the church could feel like i feel everybody could just enjoy the lord see but you got to spend time in his presence thanking him for his goodness you got to just spend time with nobody around and just love the lord and praise him god you're good wasn't the last time you just spent a minute 10 or 15 minutes telling the lord how you thank him how you love him how you appreciate him yeah you know sometimes we go year in and year out and still we're so busy we spend hours on the telephone i was talking about stuff that ain't gonna go bless nobody amen but we need to bless the lord o my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name amen you spent a little time blessing the lord you'll forget about all your troubles and oh god praise god hey all the naysayers and all that's happening and amen you forget about that why because god is so good he just come and meet you there he'll meet you in your praise amen he'll meet you when you start praising him and you forget about all the negativity amen all you begin to thank god for is blessing thank god for being so good and so real in my life lord look where i could have been look where i would have been but lord you came by look what you did for me hey you saved oh rats like me hallelujah oh somebody there was no good ratchet undone but god you cared about me thank you for caring god hallelujah oh thank you for loving me the way that you do amen god is good oh he said restore if you want to be restored your joy then there's a process that david had to acknowledge his sins and his shortcomings brother i said have you received the holy ghost since you believe and if you receive the holy ghost amen you need sometimes to be restored it's time for restoration you know i listen to that song restoration has come i've been restored amen to my place in christ amen praise god it's good to hear that song restoration has come amen i i trust that you be oh brother and sister if you're not going farther enough or deep enough it's time now that we go further nothing deep enough it's time now to re-reach out into the deep and amen grab ahold of god in a personal way and say lord i want everything amen everything that you want me to have it i want it lord i want the fullness of your spirit i want the holy ghost in my soul god i want to go all the way with you it's time to start reaching out brother sister praise god there's a reason why amen we don't get from god what we want is because amen we don't go farther enough as the prophet said with him amen we don't stay long enough for amen on the altar we don't cry out long enough until we get amen get it right i've seen a lot of people amen get the spirit on them and i've seen a lot of people get touched by the spirit and sometimes i know and they confess i got the holy ghost brother simmons and later on in their life it might take five ten years down the road sometimes 15 20 years down the road and i'm always praying the lord give them a deeper touch lord give them a deeper touch maybe a minister will come from africa maybe somebody come from japan maybe somebody come they got to say a word maybe they're getting a holy ghost field meeting and something the power of god will just take over lord they need a deeper touch they think they got it but lord they need a little bit more brother and sister if they don't get that little bit more something to come by amen and their life are going the wrong direction i've seen so many people fall away amen because they didn't go farther enough amen i don't want you to be one of those ones they meant to fall away from christ amen and get caught up and let other things in this world and in this life steal your joy from you amen i want you to know that nobody can take what god has given you the devil couldn't take they meant that life away from adam and eve but they had to give it away amen and god said i give you they meant the gift of the holy ghost i give you amen the spirit amen it's free nobody can take it from you amen and what god gives you amen the world can't take it from you don't let the devil fool you he can't take your joy amen amen you got to know amen it's me amen if i lost it it's because i gave it up if i don't have it it's me oh lord and god i want to examine and see where i left him praise god where did you leave jesus they left him on a three-day journey amen and mary and joseph did not know that they had left jesus amen and they had to go back to where they left him brother sister well you lost your joy amen well you lost your peace you got to go back and get to that place even david
