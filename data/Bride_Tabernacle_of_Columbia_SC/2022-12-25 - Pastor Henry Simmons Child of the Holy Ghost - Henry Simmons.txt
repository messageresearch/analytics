would hinder your spirit for moving and your word from having the preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ we give you glory we give you praise now in Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen Matthew 1 and 18. Matthew 1 and 18. I'll read the first you read the next we'll read the last verse together God is good amen it's kind of quiet this morning but God is good amen so glad to be in the number one more time as we end coming to the end of the year thank God it's time is passing so fast the Earth is shaking it's moving the earthquakes and every kind of thing that's happening is happening not the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise wind as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost 19. but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream and saying Joseph thy son of David fear not to take unto the demarried our wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost 21. and now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying then Joseph being rise raised from the Sleep rise from sleep did as the angel of the Lord has bitten him and took unto him his wife together and knew her not to she bought forth the firstborn son and he called his name Jesus may God bless you with each word and you may be now had this been in our day I guess it would have been a laughing stock she would have been a reproach she would have been one if she would have told her testimony who would have believed that testimony we're talking about a child of the Holy Ghost now as it [Music] bought about something that looked like a report approach and a shame so it is today with a Christian a child of the Holy Ghost somebody sung a song that the word could be born in Mary surely the word can be born In You and I if Jesus Christ the word could be born in Mary now the Bible tells us as newborn babies is out of Center milk of the word that they might grow thereby and then it talks about Christ to be informed in US we know Jesus Christ was being formed in Mary Christ is being formed in you and I amen now as we look at Luke 1 and 30. a child of the Holy Ghost I guess this is a reproach it's uh it seems something very uh mysterious and miraculous and it it it's beyond our comprehensions our minds cannot concede and neither can the world understand what it means to be born again the new birth and to be born again it's so odd amen even to the religious world into the church world it's an odd thing to be born again to be uh uh the new birth to be a new creature all of that to just uh it seems like strange babbling you you hear the terminology but amen it's no reality to the terminology because people are are just traditional Believers like it was in that day people were amen supposed to be God's children and they're supposed to be believing in God but when amen the word was manifested in their day amen they didn't want to receive it so today is the word amen comes amen and it comes off the pages because it and then it becomes reality and it gets on two feet people don't want to receive it because they think it's impossible for something like that to happen even though the word had testified of it in Isaiah 7 14. isn't that right even though it was in their Bible and they were Bible Believers yet they could not receive they can receive it as long as if it's on the pages of the book but if it got on two feet they could not receive it are you with me and uh people can receive you as you saying I'm born again and I'm a Christian I I have the new birth they can receive you talking about it amen but when it actually is a reality and it walks on two feet most of the people will say who Do You Think You Are are you with me and that's the reason why Paul says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is of the power of God it's a Salvation unto everyone to believe but you know most people that claim to have be born again or have the new birth there's no change in them [Music] there's no different from what they were amen before they claimed the new birth it meant they still act the same to live the same they talk the same they walk the same but if if reality amen uh strikes a person it began to manifest itself amen then you began to see amen as Christ came he was the son of God Amen the only begotten of the father isn't that right he was the Son of God the purpose of him coming that he might save you and I and that we also might become Sons and Daughters of God isn't that right and to be a son and daughter of God then we must have the same characteristics amen and we must have the same attributes of our father not only shall we look like him we should walk like him talk like him and act like him amen because we are what he wants are you with me because amen the church is born of his born flesh of his flesh amen the church in him are one because we came out from him as Eve was a part of Adam's Soul he meant the church was a part of God amen praise God Jesus amen was the head and the maximum amen the church is the body and The Feminine amen so what the heck done the body should do are you with me so if the body is not doing what the hell did then it is is it the body of Christ amen so in this day we should see Jesus Christ but he should be in broad form are you a man so amen because when the marriage take place the marriage of the Lamb amen the husband and the wife cannot be amen married unless and they are equally yoke are you up there so we must become one with him [Music] he said there are no more Twain but they are they're one isn't that right so Luke 1 and 30. so by the grace of God we going a little fast getting ahead of myself in the story but a child of the Holy Ghost I'm gonna tell you something the Holy Ghost makes a difference in your life it's not you know sometimes I I didn't listen to different preachers and everybody talk about the message of the hour and the end time and all that they bring the people to look like uh something that don't have any power in it are you with me they talk about it and look like they misrepresented they try to impersonate it amen but I said amen uh See Jesus Christ you can't impersonate the word like because the word is the seed of God are you with me praise God you cannot deceive the word amen the Bible said the woman Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived being in the transgression see in order for you not to be deceived you've got to be seed are you up man so if you're not the word in that you can't be deceived but if you were the word amen then you've been born again not a corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of God was a living and a body forever you are born of the word it's not a church it's not something that I just want to identify with it's not something I want to talk about it's a reality amen it's something that's real it's a life amen praise God oh Lord see because I it's it's something about all the talk and and the life is not there the manifestation that's something that people trying to make happen you don't have to try to make amen a a sheep grow wool you don't have to drive hey hey hey sheep you supposed to grow wool hey hey are you up there you don't have to try to teach a bird to fly bird you're supposed to fly and you don't have to teach a fish how to swim are you with me it's Adam you don't have to even beat somebody over the head try to tell them hey you supposed to dress like this you're supposed to do this use them on to do that no it's Adam are you up there there's something in me that makes me who I am and I love him because the love of God has been shouted abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost I love him I don't have to be forced to come to church I don't have to be forced to giving praise I don't have to be forced to tell Lord I love you I'm not ashamed to say I love him are you a man praise God amen I don't have to tell you hey I I believe that ain't nobody called four amen praise God I don't have to prove it to nobody amen it's reality it's Jesus Christ amen you've been brought back to the word you've been restored it should be a power there there should be a demonstration now they said he had been with Jesus why because they were doing what Jesus did amen and if you're not doing what Jesus did amen then it doesn't matter what you say amen your actions speak louder than your worries amen praise God but if you really love the Lord amen praise God you will it'll be amen the light has shine I said the love of God was shattered abroad the light will shine praise God I don't care how much Darkness it is I don't care who's doing what I said the light has shine praise God that's why it's light because it shines praise God that's why you're a Christian so you know because the life in you praise God the life is in your Mickey that's why you live like you live that's why you walk like you walk because it's India if it wasn't anything you couldn't do it but what is inside it's not how much tongue you're speaking it's not how much you're dancing shout it's not how loud you scream but it's in you it's alive it's a life that you live something in me amen I know he loves me he cares and I love him amen praise God you don't have to say every day I love you honey amen if you're not treating the right are you up man you don't have to tell like you and convince her that you love all you got to do is treat her right are you up there praise God you don't have to tell your parents amen parents I love your parents amen amen you got to show them amen you gotta show them I love you everybody amen take it easy what the teacher what the what you hear amen praise God show them how much you appreciate and make them working and then going and giving your clothes and food to eat and tell them how much you appreciate what are you doing about being obedient amen by being obedient by

and Truth are you with me so she was found with the child of the what so the Holy Ghost was the father amen and the Holy Ghost is Jesus but when Jesus was on Earth he manifested himself in flesh as a man isn't that right are y'all weapon now Adam when he was created Adam was created he was a man but Jesus was of the new creation he was created amen praise God let's just see how he was created you got Michaela let's let's see and save me some time the 28th verse he said Mary in the last verse but I want to say instead of Mary you got to see the bride position in the last day it's not Mary but it's brother Simmons are you with me it's brother Henry Simmons how about you I see my name in the book you see yours Amen in Isaiah 7 14 did you see Mary amen but one day Mary so Isaiah 7 14 she can say I see Mary are you with me one day John amen was a voice of one crying in the wilderness but one day it wasn't just a voice it was John amen one day amen Monica 4 was turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father it ain't children it's me oh you want me amen I I take an ownership I recognize who it is who is talking about you're talking about me are you a man and I'm turned back to the word that's when I come out of battle and fought to come back to the Bible the Apostle Doctrine the teaching the amen the apostles are you a man come back to the Bible not to a man but to the Bible not to some system but to the Bible not just some somebody in them made a mess or something and called it Lord have mercy when I come back to the Bible the word that's what it means to me that's what Malachi 4 said to me come back to the word come back to the Bible get away from all these Creeds and dogmas of men are you with me when man the way we want to lift up man we want to lift up Jesus praise God we're lifting up Jesus You're going to hear more about Jesus here praise God thank God for the prophet amen say Amen thank God for Eliza but I want praise God when Isaac come forth Isaac praise God I want you to hear you talk about Isaacs don't tell anybody else tell me about Isis when Christ come inside of you that's who I want to hear praise God like you're married to him he's the word are you up there Hallelujah so many people just well you know I thank God for at least no that was Abraham's servant and he might have brought me to Isaac but when I got married to Isaac Isaac don't want to hear about Eliza oh you wouldn't be because you're married to Isaac and you're married to Jesus Christ and he is the word are you with me go ahead on Kayla you got to have a mic man getting everybody here okay God is good isn't that right excuse me sorry I'm about to sound like I'm rebuking you but I love you brother God bless you and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that thou I highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women a blessed are you among churches because you're the bride are you with me you're blessed are you with me I didn't I didn't just choose them because you know there's a lot of women in Israel there's a lot of churches in the world but I chose you because you're bride you're special are you with me God did oh Lord he knew exactly what he was doing doing when he told you when God saved you you know a lot of folk go to church they ain't saved a lot of preachers preaching ain't saying are you with me they're preaching about a god but they haven't accept him as Lord of their life you can see the devil still ruler all that they be doing you know you know how can God live inside something like what they doing taking all the people money dancing in the church cutting oh Lord doing all that foolishness are you with me we got to have come down to holiness be holy for I'm holy are you with me let's be real God is calling us to perfection we got to be like Jesus Our Father which is Heaven is perfect he said be you perfect are you with me read on and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and casting her mind what man of salutation this should be now out of all the people in the world God chose you now she got to say I don't believe you and that's what happens when Jesus come to you as an individual it speaks to your heart it's whether or not you want to believe that it's God you might think the preachers preacher mama told me daddy told him but when God deals with you as an individual it ain't no mama daddy a preacher and then on church it's you as an individual God speaks to you as an individual and you his voice you know ah I had something talking through my head and something's telling me how to do right and all to live right I hear it all the time you know I get but somehow you ought to stop hearing it all the time you ought to listen listen to that inner person that's calling you that inner voice because something tell you don't do it wrong and something tell you go ahead on you know and if you want to do wrong you go do wrong because it what who you think telling you to do wrong who you think telling you to do right God the same voice God used to tell you to give your life to the Lord isn't that right all you gotta do is listen but we think angel I got to see an angel with a white anything could come with white robe and everything and light and tell you a lie and folks want that but they don't I'm gonna tell you so if you believe take it back to the Bible because an angel could tell a lie to you you can be a fallen angel but you got to go back and make sure that angel telling you what's written in the Bible are you with me I gotta close go ahead on killer and the angel said unto her fear not married for God has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive and thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end they didn't say marry unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which see you call it the holy thing that Holy thing you see that Holy thing you see what I'm saying God was creating a egg and sperm creating a body didn't come from Mary it didn't come from Joseph but it came from God are you with me and that's what God is doing for you and I this mysterious and miraculous thing that happened in our lives when the Holy Ghost come and overshadow us and God comes in praise God some of you have experienced that day that time when God starts speaking to your heart start talking to you praise God and then it's got heavy to you it got so heavy that you couldn't ignore it no more you couldn't hear you couldn't ignore the voice no more something never can't forget the time I was running around the football field they asked me to play something by pro ball with them and I thinking I was going to do it please send my pro ball and try to make it to the pros then I heard that voice yeah I was going to church and everything trying to do right but I hadn't fully surrendered and my mama used to tell me I want God because you you know you can see every fault and everybody else in the whole church the preaching everybody my mom said son you got no God for yourself pray God open your eyes because I needed him she knew I needed God because you can come to church you can see everybody else but that don't help you now it don't help you none to see everybody else but when you have that voice come to you and you hear God for yourself didn't matter about the semi-pro ball or going to the pros and none of that stuff matter no more I wanted God when I came to church it wasn't no more me looking at the Hypocrites I didn't care what the Hypocrites did I didn't care how what people said I don't care what people done and there were nothing gonna make me turn around are you with me because I knew it was God that was speaking to me I knew it wasn't nobody but God that spoke to me and that's why I hadn't turned around yet are you with me the devil offered me a lot of stuff there's a lot of Temptation a lot of things happening these years 50 something years a lot of things happen but God kept me are you with me I say God kept me the god that saved me kept me not saying God that saved me kept me he'd never failed me yet and he won't fail you he'll never fail you the god the Savior will keep you if it's him and you know it's him he'll never fail you if he saved you he'll keep you and I'm gonna tell you some I ain't been disappointed I went through some sleepy night a lot of tears and a lot of crime but I wouldn't take nothing for this journey now I wouldn't take nothing for my journey I'm glad that he saved me where would I be today while I went on ignored that voice and went on and played Semi-Pro ball and somehow made it to the pros where would I be I tell you what decision when I heard him I know it was time I know it was time then when I heard him I know that was my time that was it I didn't care what I had in my mind what I wanted to do what I wanted to be I know it was my time it was over with praise God one of my friends he was going to the Army Academy and we was running together the football I went I didn't want to tell him God was speaking to me I said I can't tell him because he didn't think I'm crazy I walked off the field he said what's wrong with you man
