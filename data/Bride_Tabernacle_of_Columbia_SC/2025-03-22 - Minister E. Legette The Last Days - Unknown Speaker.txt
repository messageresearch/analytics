amen amen and it reads this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covers coverst boasters proud blasphemers disobedient parents unthankful and holy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors he High high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep in the houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth may God bless your reading of his word you may be seated by the grace of God tonight we just want to minister for short moment amen and I I entitled it the last days amen the last days how many believe we living in the last days amen amen we can see the signs of the time and you know looking at some of the things I I was praying the other day I was even when the storm was coming out of nowhere Sunday and I was praying I said Lord you know know that all these things got to hit the earth and they ain't going to stop but I said God just just watch over us don't let it be too bad and you know I was thanking God that it seemed to have you know it just passed over us but every little every little Victory you know God gives us you know as time go on and Christian Journey you learn to thank God for every little Victory amen and you also learn that that you can go to God for anything amen amen whether it seems to be out of your hands out of your um control or whatever it might be but you can go to God for anything and see that's what I believe that he wants to get us to to that place to where we can just lean on them and we see like we said the signs of the time things transpire taking place that that you don't have no control over right am but it's going to have to I believe what God is wanting to do is push us back into that Faith realm back to that place to where I was thinking the other day I was laying down I said Lord you know I'm just thinking about you know how far the the church world has gone and how far they've gotten away from what real Christianity is amen gotten away from the the the the power Hallelujah the signs and the Wonders got away from those things because the times going on and and in and uh not education but the technology and all going on and so what it is now people look more to those things than looking to God himself but no matter how much Advance this world gets Jesus is still the answer to all our problems amen come on do y'all believe that amen come on no matter how how much money you got amen no matter how much whatever it is you know I've been witnessing a lot at job lately and one of the guys he was telling me about his daughter in college and what she was going to be uh I forgot but his his other son is going to be a pilot and he was saying I hope I get to live to see him you know succeed and so we other guy I was picking at him we said you ought to speak positive you know he was like yeah but he said you know you can go any minute he said I can walk out this door right here and fall dead and we said that's true so I asked them I said well if that was the case if that's if that happens I said where's your soul I asked him that begin to talk to him about his I said are you ready to meet God then if you if you come to the grips of that are you ready to meet God and he sat there and he paused he says well I don't know and I said so you know that's the thing I said you understanding that life is so short right you understanding that things can turn friend of mine passed away the other day at 40 years old it hit me kind of hard but I said things can turn but being aware of that is one thing but if if God has allowed you to be aware of that what are you doing about your Soul's salvation come on so I begin to ask you know a lot of people I says you know you saved talk to them you know because I said that's the one more important the one most important thing out your Christian Journey you can sing you can play you can do all these other things you can do all but where is your soul with God come on you got to consider that Hallelujah and even we all we often I I said Lord you know what it is God always brings us back to that you know I I find out today I says you know just reading here we talking about the last days you know uh as Paul is writing the letter of Timothy and tell him about the things that we ought to look out for in the last days so many things he named you know we we a go over them all like we did the other other day but so many things he named that it's going to be in the last days we going to have to deal with but I says what the what the devil will will do he'll have you and I fighting one another and yet we still got all these things to contend with come on the Bible says they they'll hate you just cuz you're doing good you love the truth they'll hate you just for that right dealing with a world where the people they they love pleasure more than they love God come on love their own selves and pleasure more than they love God talk to I said you know I had a dream and in a dream uh Guys somebody was wanting to get baptized and I was talking to him and I says I says I ask you something I said you willing to give those cigarettes up and you know what they did they held on to those cigarettes and said they'd rather keep the cigarettes because that was more valuable to them than their than their soul Hallelujah but it it might not be cigarettes for you it might whatever it is I want to say what's more valueable to you tonight come on you got to consider that sometimes it could be children wife house car money what's valuable you see what it is when you come to God you get you go behind that Veil it's just you and God Alone come on your eyes got to be single whether you young or old it's just you and God Alone back there come on the world is shut out right but the problem is today people don't they don't never go to that experience do they come on they never go to that extreme because the the the church seems sometime just to adopt that you can just come in maybe cry some tears and and everything all right come on in get baptized but never uh uh preach or lead the people into a personal relationship with God and that's why they you know they say just confess your sins but you confess him and do it again confess him and do it again confess him and do it again that's because the heart never changed come on but you know one thing about God he won't force himself on you come on you got to be willing Hallelujah to open up and say God you know Save Me From Myself come in God and and and and do something in my heart come on cuz I want to change I'm looking at myself in the mirror of the word and I don't see the reflection of you I don't see Hallelujah that image you know one thing about it you know he says they be he High minded right ever learning but never coming into the knowledge of the truth I said one thing about you know that early church in which the the first and the last church should be the same one thing about that early church before they went out you know before they even went out to preach the gospel Jesus told him to go t in Jerusalem right to you be endured with power what was that power he was going to send back the Holy Ghost come on you can't be an effective witness without the Holy Ghost it come on Hallelujah you can't testify right without the Holy Ghost come on so they had to wait on it but today what happens today the church jump right past that don't they come on let's be real look at I said God what it is we want the anointing I don't know about you I said God I want the anointing am I want the the presence of God come on more than just to say oh you big walk no but you need it to live right you need it the demons and the Devils you and I got to contend with you going to need a supernatural God more than just what that's what it is I don't know what's in the minds of people sometimes maybe think that oh oh we we in the message or whatever they want to say it don't matter don't I says what it is where where is your soul come on Goliath coming one day amen come on what's the used to me all the Mysteries all those headed highed things just like Saul Head and Shoulders above everybody wasn't he but when Goliath showed up come on that didn't mean a thing did it Hallelujah but what meant the world was that they had a little boy David in the camp what he had different Hallelujah from the everybody else was he had Faith Amen to be able to take God at his word and say Lord this is what you promised now I'm going to get it hallelujah amen not trusting in the slingshot like they say even those stones but what he was trusting in he said how we let him defy the armies of the Living God come on God gave us promises we preached the promises but when the trial come why you ain't standing on them Hallelujah come on oh Jesus and it's the truth ain't it preach healing right preach Miracle signs and wonders laying hands on the sick but when your biggest trial come Hallelujah so many times people they don't know what to do do they Hallelujah because they missing that the the leadership of the Holy Ghost come on what it is I don't know about you but in my time when I when I didn't know what to do Hallelujah and it happens of you have times you don't know what to do the spirit comes and he leads you what to do amen amen he'll open the word that's what it is the the Holy Ghost he'll open the word to you come on Amen scriptures become real to you then amen you seeing it in a different light because now in your time of trouble he's giving you what it takes to overcome Hallelujah one thing I like what David told go he said after this day the whole world going to know that there's a God in Israel come on what it was what did he have different he had Faith didn't you you know I says they're ever learning but never coming into the knowledge of the truth amen come on what is truth hallelujah but what it is I said Lord It's 2025 how can many today just reach back and grab have simple Faith Hallelujah cuz so many things in their view Hallelujah so many things blocking Cloud their minds so much in their people view but how can they what it is God puts us in positions the way nothing else Hallelujah but a miracle we'll do amen he'll do that come on but even in those times people don't turn the right way do they come on but I says you know I was been doing a lot of witness and stuff lately and I said you know one of the guys at work he was saying uh he was he was pretty deep pretty intellectual and he was breaking down all kinds of things cuz he's reading so many books and he kept saying the Bible said this I said man show us in the Bible where that's at he said oh out s cuz he read he ended so much he get it all mixed up but just talking with him and um you know about all those things and I says you know one thing about it I said you can have all that knowledge Hallelujah I says but what about Crossing Jordan River come on Amen what about the life that's got to get you out the ground come on you know do you know where you stand with God out of all of that or do you still question even after all of that Hallelujah come on if anybody knew what the importance of the spirit was more than knowledge I believe it would have been Paul come on taught at the knew all those things but when he when he was knocked down come on and the light Shone about him then he said all those things that you know he thought he knew I like how Paul said when a man you know knowledge puff up he said when you think you know something you don't know nothing come on but he had to realize when he met that light come on that the spirit meant more than all that intellectual stuff come on what he thought he knew he had to forget about it didn't he now the Holy Ghost was going to teach him come on Amen in the word what come on you know I was I was I was looking at things about manmade Creeds and dogs come on and I was looking at the Apostles Creed and all those things and I was looking at so much doing a little bit of studying and stuff but I says the thing is it might have started with this a little bit started with a little bit now you way out there Hallelujah with beliefs that don't line no way near up to the Bible right come on can't bring it through the word and then want God to to uh uh acknowledge that or vindicate that God can't V what God vindicates is his word come on that's what the whole message was supposed to do bring you back to the word come on open the word to you Hallelujah where the life is come on not just saying this quote now go come on but no power bring you back to the life Hallelujah come on but you got to find it somewhere I believe down on your knees hallelujah amen you going you ain't going to just find it just anywhere God going to put you on your knees come on commune and fellowship with him but people don't want to spend time with God do they come on Hallelujah I'm stirred tonight come on I know it's sound like but I'm stirred because I says this guy the other day had all this stuff really and I I begin to say what what stirred my heart though he was saying all this and uh one of the guys in the room you wouldn't even expect he says he says man he says sometimes cuz the God told me he says well the Bible talks about angels and demons but nobody never saw one I said I hey he said about God I said I don't know about you but I see God every day but I begin to tell him about some experiences and stuff and he saids well I know lot so what it is and that's the way the people Minds me today come on they read a Bible they quote it they talk about it but to really have faith to believe in it they don't believe it they think maybe it's oh they saying everything but the days of the miracle has passed but that's what their action show but I was talking with the guy about that one of the guys at work unlikely person he says um you know he says man I'm going tell you something he told the other guy he says sometimes I just be riding down the in in the car he said I don't hardly ever go to church he says but I was raised in church he said but I'll be riding in the car sometimes and he said something will just come over me and he says I'll just out of my mouth I'll just start saying thank you Lord for blessing me he said he'll just start praising God in the car by itself you know he said cuz something then the guy said you say something come in the car what you mean right so he says I'm going to give you another example he said Ernest he says when I first met him he didn't tell me he was preacher Christian and all that he says but he come around me every time he came around me I felt something different and I was stirred just listening to him he says it's like he can walk in the room sometimes and it we could be going on but conversations changed he says and then after a while he said I always knew it was something different about Earnest because he bringing something with him right so I begin to talk to the guy thinking that it's something made up cuz he want to feel what what we talking about now he want to feel it and I begin to tell him I said see that's the presence of God we talking about I says you you know all this other things but yet you don't know the presence you know all those other things but yet you don't know what it feels like Hallelujah when the Shak kind of Glory come down you never been in that but the thing about it is God ain't withholding it from you he want to show you how to get there come on but it's going to be not head and high minded Hallelujah not you might not be out in the Forefront nobody can see you but you'll be in the closet somewhere praying in the Midnight Hour amen hallelujah you'll spend some long time with God shut in a hidden life with Christ come on Hallelujah but people want to all out in the front come on I don't know but I love that hidden life I love those Community I can talk to God about stuff I can't talk to nobody else about and he understands Hallelujah am comes down and comforts me in my time Hallelujah of need come on and he wants to do that for you too he wants to do that for the whole world but they got other avenues and other options that they run to come on but God is standing right there saying here I am cast your cares on me come on take my yoke upon you and learn them Hallelujah come onk what I say is uh God was talking like that and I was telling him I said that's what it is you know it it's it's it's the presence of God all of that and I begin to tell him he say so you mean all of this don't mean nothing I says it ain't is it relevant to your salvation come on might be good to know not say don't just be in the dark about things come on cuz God gave it to us for us to know it come on what I says don't miss it's like Paul was saying here you know he was saying one place I believe he saying you know to learn of him he was saying uh hear in the hear in the um in the ninth verse this this is the thing I said you can know all these things but come on it's the spirit you nothing can't take the place of the Spirit come on his presence the Holy Ghost got to bring life to the word if anybody knew that Paul knew that he had a Zeal for God didn't he killing the Church of God nobody couldn't live it just like how he was living how close he was but when he ran when God caught up with him one day come on he realized that was the most important thing come on Amen how many believe that tonight come on like I said Goliath coming y'all believe that amen come on the world wins all those things coming and it's going to try you you know God allows that that's how God got it set up right and the one that you think don't know nothing or the one you think he ain't on your level or she ain't on your level what she have or he have what it takes to make it through the storm Hallelujah I was telling my wife the other day it's it's a girl at work and when you look at her she looked like you know uh just somebody people I grew up around you know it look kind of rough like character maybe but she's got she was telling me about her children her five children and uh she was telling me about how her nieces and all those dress and how she saw them at the wedding and how she was she was going on about how these young girls put on all kind of clothes and presenting their self all in front of a man you know like a prostitute then he hand her a certain way to take it then people get upset she says but I'm telling them you throw it out there in front of them Hallelujah come on but I listened to her for a while and I said sometimes she look like she got more sense Hallelujah than the people that's supposed to know better right come on I was telling my wife that the other day but it's the truth right it's one thing to be able to see Hallelujah from the eyes naturalized but it's another thing when God open your spiritual eyes Hallelujah so might might look good come on it might look worth pleasant but it's death come on Amen God showed you that because he opened your eyes am I thank God for opening my eyes Hallelujah am come on I thank God for those times when I would have made great mistakes but he comes by through the word of God sometime just a simple sermon or whatever God send somebody by your way and you recognize that that's the that's God speaking to you and you better take heed come on but what it is you learn to be led by the spirit amen come on not by what you feel all the other things or what oh this hard to be got do it this way come on Hallelujah he ain't going to lead you outside his word but I said God I want to stand in your word at all cost come on Hallelujah but what it is I said you know just talking with the god I says this is this is the part here the the ninth verse he says but they shall proceed no further talking about the men of corrupt Minds repr probate concerning Faith but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be manifest unto all them as theirs also was some Janice and jambers he says but thou H has fully known my Doctrine come on the manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions and afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and I cor and LOM what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall pers shall suffer persecution but evil man and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and H has been assured of knowing of whom thou H has learned them come on true I said he talked about all those things and he can tell tell you about all the Deep things and all the all those things but he says my Doctrine he said that you that you learn you saw in me I want you to continue with it one that's the things that was more important longsuffering come on patience am come on all those those are core values come on he said you hold on to those things he said y'all know how I suffered come on and ium and life stre whatever he called it he said y'all know where how I suffered he says but God hallelujah delivered me from out all of it amen and God will deliver you as well come on all the Godly out of persecution but you got to hold on to those things right you got to hold on to faith you got to hold on to patience you got to know the simple things and how to get in how to come in God's presence you know when they when they had the Tabernacle set up you couldn't just go in there any kind of way you couldn't miss not one step or it was death when you got back there come on and God is showing us even to day is death if you don't go back there but you still got to go back there he shows you how to get in that presence come on he speaks to you Hallelujah teaches you those simple those basic things walk Meek and humble lowly Hallelujah get away from that self pride and all those things and thinking you somebody get away from that because you'll never get in my presence that way come on but let me humble you let me show you how to be meek and lonely Hallelujah cuz in that presence there's fullness of joy hallelujah amen in that presence it's not a religion that'll bind you up but it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory in there hallelujah it's life after death come on thank you Lord resurrects you up then you realize what real living is all about come on and you got something to look forward to even if your eyes were to shut here come on Hallelujah I believe God Amen but I begin to sharing that and I said you know come on I says all those things you I told me a lot of that ain't even relevant but I says what you what I want I says you got to know God come on do you know the man Christ Jesus has he come in your life as a personal savior have you seen yourself come on is needing his help amen come on have you let him in come on some people say I let them in but in certain rooms I ain't going to let them go in it won't do no good he wants to get in every room but he ain't going to force himself right he wants to come in you know one thing about it God en closing God I says is thinking about all the storms and things that's hitting and looking at how World stage and America that all their all their all their bad things coming out in full view now all their weaknesses come on coming out in full view naked exposed in front of their enemies come on but yet the handwriting is on the wall come on America Got to pay but the thing about it is as we see those things I said Lord my heart ain't going to fear come on but just as you brought me from the very beginning you promis that you'll keep me amen amen I said God that's all I'm asking you to do amen keep me Lord just a little while longer come on and when my foot would slip let my trust be in you my mind gets on anything else and it's dominating come on let me God sometimes you you get caught up but I said God get me out of that mess come on take me by the hand and pull me out like lot knows knew the city was being destroyed but yet the Bible said they lingered still but the Angels the Bible said God being merciful grabbed them by the hands and pulled them out I said God if you got to pull me yes Lord hallelujah let me yield to you no matter what I want what the body wants all those things God I just want you amen cuz in the end that's all that's going to matter and you been so good to me this far Hallelujah but I ain't going to let the block the blessings block my vision of you and where I started at Hallelujah I started knowing that I was a sinner needed a savior started at the cross Hallelujah recognizing your blood and that was shed for me if I ever get away from that bring me back to it God hallelujah how many want that tonight come on I don't know about you but that's what I want Lord J you know out here praying I've been meditating on God all week God told me you got to leave by example come on the Lord put that Spirit you got to Le by example you say this and that you get yourself Hallelujah you get back come on Amen you get down on your knees more you pray more you fast more you cry out more come on leave my example amen come on I said God the only way I can do that is I got to be led by you cuz I don't know where I'm going at amen hallelujah but God I know your spirit you know where we going yay though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I don't fear no evil God is leading us hallelujah oh Jesus and I believe he'll lead us through this Dark Hour [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise God we're not just in the last days we at the end of the last days so by the grace of God we appreciate the word tonight you know I was thinking how God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same God speaks so simple he's there even when we don't recognize that he he's there he's talking to us even though we're not listening sometimes sometimes God talked to us and speaks to us and and we think it's just our own thoughts or just something a coincidence I remember when God echoed his voice to me it it it was loud and I know it was the my time to come to him it's going to church and off and on and but when God speak to you you know that you come to the end of the road you know when you're in it's come talking to brother Nathan he said you often times tell when God spoke to him and come to the end of the road you can be young but when God speak to you things change when God spoke to Samuel things change you thought he was an Eli talking sometime we can get the voice of God confused it's St it's just something that God is leading us to but we think sometimes you know it's just something that it's happening and sometimes we don't know the leading of the Lord God leads us away from the things that we think we want things that we think we need and way he leads us is just like Abraham we're going on a journey but we don't know where we going but we know that God called us he speaks to our hearts he speaks to us amen and we know he's speaking to to us and we are Jour and we taking it step by step amen amen every step we take God I don't know how I'm going to make it but I know you lead me yes Lord Jesus sometimes we don't know we we don't have trust in our own ability our own self that we can make it as a Christian but God when he speaks to us all we got to do is yield and surrender to his voice and when we surrender God began to bless it's all about surrendering so tonight we thank God for the word I'm send surrender while you have a chance while we have a chance to [Music] surrender we surrender to the voice of God amen amen I look at we the biggest mistake that you can make in life is when God call you you go the other direction [Music] sometimes I look at different ones sometimes family members you can fast you can pray you can do everything you can sometime you don't even know what they just gone there's no return but you still there standing in the got with all you got still there praying seeking God y'all know this is serious business when we dealing with God it ain't going to be you just doing something I'm just doing what I feel led to do it's got to be God it's got to be God at the end you got to be certain it's God you just can't do it cuz I I just feel like I want to do this I want to do that when you're dealing with God it's got to be God you don't take a chance with your soul you don't play with your own soul you got to know it's God probably God talking about being certain of God you got to be certain I know we spend most of our lives and we just do what we want to do what we led to do but the Bible said whatsoever you do in words of deed do it all in the name of the Lord he said they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God whatever we do we ought to ask God is it all right yes amen amen Lord if is it all right for me to do this or that praying the morning God lead me in the right direction amen Lord guide me and and and and and Lord watch over my steps that I'll do the right thing amen that I'll be led by your spirit amen God keep me in the way amen can't keep myself I asked the boys just before I came out I said y'all pray for me all of a sudden I was feeling so bad and uh I see y'all pray with me pray for me you know and I told him I said you know it's like this you could be here today and brother Ernie said that and you can be gone just like that boom gone and I thought about it I says I got to take this thing serious I got to start lining up things in life because I could be gone [Music] tomorrow and it not only and I told I told him simply it might have made shook him up a little bit but I said I could be gone I I said cuz what I'm dealing with right now I need y'all pray and the boys prayed with me then they went and told their mama daddy back that's sick she said you all right I said I'm all right she said you sure you all right I said I'm all right I know they had told her daddy but it it was serious because I thought on those moments you know you can come into some hard situations and I mean things that are happening to you you don't know what's going on and you say well I got to I I got to make get my business straight cuz in any time you can go and everybody that say oh brother Simmons is all right uh brother J's all right brother J we don't know one of those bad feelings could just we gone one of those moments where you know you're just tired and don't want to get up out of the bed sometimes and you one of those moments can I just sleep or rest a little while longer but you know you kids can't stand in the bed you got to get up it's it's 6:00 it's time to get up 6:00 in the morning well yeah been waiting get up at 7 this the [Music] morning oh then s come you can't take it you can't take it past s it's hard 8 you done got up you got to get up even if you got to go back except at 8:00 you got to get up you I don't know about y'all but I got to get up I got to move but the days would come when you can't get up the hour come when you can't I was thinking about my brother Nathan and I remember when he was so weak when I would pray for him I feel his weakness and uh he couldn't even feed himself sister CA was feeding him and all and I was praying that God give him strength I just praying God strengthen him Lord God I saw how weak he was and sometime you know it might look like he was strong enough but he wasn't strong enough you know and I look at him now and I thank the Lord I said God you're a miracle worker amen amen but it could be any of us at any time go God has I mean it's simple so I'm saying the the walk that you walk as a Christian take it serious amen life that you're living take it serious because you only have one life to live and you got to be careful how you live this life amen because the god that gave you the life is going to call you in question about what he the life that he gave you as God servant say he'll call you in question the life that I gave you what did you do with it amen amen was it a life of play at you did you throw it away like the man throw the talent away said God I know you was what kind of person you was and and the man that had two talents he gained more one that had five and but the one that had one and some people respond like the man had one we waste it or we'll bury it and when he come back here here goes what you gave me but God is looking for us he told Adam and Eve he said be fruitful and what multip multiply God is looking for you to be fruitful and to multiply be fruitful and multiply amen amen he he's looking for when he came to the fct Tre and saw no F he cursed it be fruitful and multiply God wants to see fruit out of our Christian walk fruits out of our Christian experience God wants you to go forth and bring forth fruit amen praise God your life should be a testimony and a witness and a light that somebody would see it and they would be able to come to Jesus amen have you won one soul to Jesus have you led one soul to Jesus have you even uh had one soul to come to [Music] church look around you think about it God hides himself in Simplicity the little that I God gave me can I use it or will I abuse it God wants you to use the little the gift that he gave us and not to abuse it amen use it to glorify God and don't abuse it because only that which is done for Christ last amen God bless you didn't know I was going to say that much but sister kios came in late I had to give a second [Music] sermon but I didn't know but God is good do you love him amen but y'all pray for me take it serious y'all don't know any one of us can go any [Music] time and uh brother PR praise God you and sister Patricia y'all a little bit older than me
