[42:10] living in the day and hour that we're
[42:11] living in what time is
[42:15] it the prophet of God said what time is
[42:18] it sir sir is this the time at the
[42:21] end I believe this is the time
[42:27] all the events that are taking place
[42:29] when I saw you know the floods over in
[42:32] California said the waves was going up
[42:35] 40
[42:36] feet I said oh goodness I said is this
[42:39] the time that California going to go
[42:42] sink in the ocean and the waves is just
[42:46] I said oh Lord could it be I
[42:50] said I said this thing is getting it's
[42:53] getting tight it's getting close
[42:57] I mean the whole the whole world you
[43:01] know it's it's getting if you look at it
[43:05] it'll get pretty
[43:07] scary it really would shake you up if
[43:10] you look at just a little bit of the
[43:13] news and see what's going on around the
[43:15] world it's is
[43:18] scary and they trying to do all they can
[43:21] to do to keep the movement of the ships
[43:25] going through
[43:27] over
[43:32] there by Israel and all of that
[43:35] and and then uh people are just it's
[43:39] just so
[43:40] chaotic I mean if the ships were are not
[43:43] able to flow through that
[43:46] sea what sea is
[43:49] that black sea or
[43:51] whatever if they're not ready able to
[43:54] flow then economies of the world is
[43:58] going to be in
[44:00] chaos so what happens they we're
[44:03] depending
[44:04] on and the the people are shooting
[44:07] missiles and trying to attack those
[44:09] ships the cargo ships and so forth that
[44:12] they not be able to transport the
[44:17] cargo everything Israel and Under Siege
[44:21] and I mean they uh I mean the world look
[44:25] like they turning against Israel and if
[44:29] the world turn against
[44:30] Israel then where are
[44:33] we the Gentile times will be ending and
[44:37] the Jewish time will set in for the
[44:40] 144,000 the Great Tribulation period to
[44:42] set
[44:44] in we'll see the last part of Daniel 70
[44:50] weeks and if we're not in Tribulation
[44:53] time or we're not in the Millennium time
[44:55] and we're not where are we what time is
[45:00] it see the Bible said when the fullness
[45:03] of the Gentiles come
[45:06] in that it's going to be a time when the
[45:08] Gentiles space is going to end and God
[45:11] going to return back to the
[45:14] Jews so our time is running
[45:19] out as it is in the
[45:22] world on the world stage time is right
[45:25] rning
[45:28] now when we said if all these events and
[45:31] all these things are
[45:36] occurring then he said look up for your
[45:39] Redemption draweth
[45:42] n the
[45:44] bride so let let me go back here it says
[45:48] and knowing the time it is high time to
[45:51] what to
[45:54] awake out of sleep
[45:58] right to wait you remember in Matthew 25
[46:02] five virgin was wise five are
[46:08] foolish
[46:11] right and then they heard the bridegroom
[46:14] is coming isn't that right and when they
[46:17] heard the voice the cry that the
[46:19] bridegroom was coming all those virgins
[46:22] Rose and trimmed their
[46:24] lamp
[46:26] and some five of The Virgins all ran
[46:31] out now he says it's high time and I I
[46:36] you know it's a it's a time of the
[46:40] morning
[46:42] sun and the Sun get brighter and the
[46:46] when it get high
[46:49] noon and all of a sudden the sun is
[46:52] getting ready to go
[46:54] down and we're at at the going down of
[46:57] the Sun the evening
[46:59] time the sun is getting ready to go
[47:03] down that means we're getting ready to
[47:06] go
[47:08] into darkness the tribulation period
[47:12] we're right at that particular cycle of
[47:15] time the Great Tribulation is
[47:18] right is it it's it you can see the fuse
[47:23] I mean it's it's it's been
[47:26] Ed and it's going to explode after a
[47:30] while the Bombs over there in Russia the
[47:33] nuclear bombs and stuff it's been shook
[47:38] up as I said the other night the
[47:40] volcanoes are
[47:43] erupting Iceland full of ice but what
[47:47] happened all the fire shooting
[47:51] up all over the
[47:54] world Things Are
[47:56] crucial
[47:57] times so he says it's hard time to what
[48:01] wake
[48:02] up isn't that right it's high time it's
[48:07] it's it's a serious
[48:11] time that we should wake
[48:14] up I'm saying don't
[48:18] let
[48:20] 24 catch you like it caught you in
[48:24] 23
[48:28] 2024 because I believe in
[48:34] 24 it's a crucial time that you have to
[48:38] be
[48:39] ready so he says
[48:45] here for your salvation he says is near
[48:49] than when we
[48:51] believe your salvation is
[48:54] near
[48:56] you
[48:57] know I was excited I mean this morning I
[49:01] I I got pretty

[1:03:57] that I said we don't say we love you
[1:04:00] it's hard it's hard to say I love you
[1:04:04] and some you need to tell the church
[1:04:06] every now and then you love them need to
[1:04:09] tell the people you love them cuz
[1:04:11] sometime people don't know
[1:04:13] that cuz the devil mess with people
[1:04:19] mind you need to tell your wife I love

[1:04:56] but
[1:04:57] sometime sometime we don't you know it's
[1:05:00] hard to it's hard to let our emotions
[1:05:03] go as it is in the natural sometimes
[1:05:06] it's hard to let go in the
[1:05:09] spirit sometimes it's hard to tell God
[1:05:12] God I love
[1:05:13] you because if you start honestly uh
[1:05:17] from your heart telling God I love you
[1:05:19] things going to happen in your life and
[1:05:21] you're going to find your life all
[1:05:23] changed
[1:05:24] amen you're going to find that it his
[1:05:28] anointing going to come and his presence
[1:05:30] going to come when you tell God you love
[1:05:34] him it's going to take some action it's
[1:05:37] going to take something out of you when
[1:05:39] you start telling God I love you Lord
[1:05:42] amen Jesus I love
[1:05:48] you he's going to say how you going to
[1:05:51] love me if you don't love one another
[1:05:57] you got to love one
[1:05:59] another in order to love me you got to
[1:06:02] love one another are you with
[1:06:05] me and if you don't love one another you
[1:06:08] can't you don't love
[1:06:11] me
[1:06:13] amen so you got to care you got to show
[1:06:16] that compassion one towards
[1:06:19] another because it's hard time to awake
[1:06:21] out of
[1:06:23] sleep
[1:06:28] some I don't know why somebody says I'm
[1:06:31] not going to B on but backwards for
[1:06:33] nobody you know I ain't going out my way
[1:06:35] to show nobody no
[1:06:41] love my love is
[1:06:47] distance I love you from a
[1:06:50] distance not close
[1:06:53] up but we need love with some affection
[1:06:56] to it some feeling to
[1:07:01] it and I'm saying it's time to wake up
[1:07:03] and love God with some affection some
[1:07:05] feeling in
[1:07:07] it that we can
[1:07:09] feel the spirit of God we can feel the
[1:07:12] love of God we feel it inside of us and
[1:07:16] we want to give out what we
[1:07:19] got but if we don't have it in the
[1:07:21] inside we can't give it out to nobody
[1:07:25] but we got to feel the embracing of
[1:07:28] God's arms and we're in his arms we're
[1:07:31] in his care and he loves us and he cares
[1:07:34] about us and you want to love him back
[1:07:37] and tell him I appreciate
[1:07:40] it I appreciate what you done for me
[1:07:43] Lord I
[1:07:45] appreciate you know laying there in the
[1:07:48] bed and then getting
[1:07:50] up said Lord thank you
[1:07:54] I I I'm feeling
[1:07:57] better thank you God feel
[1:08:01] good so I got a traged of moments when I
[1:08:04] when I feel good and realize that I
[1:08:06] could have been in the
[1:08:09] bed feeling

[1:12:41] just read Thessalonians here first
[1:12:43] Thessalonians 5 I got to close
[1:12:48] but I thought
[1:12:50] about my New Year's message
[1:12:57] and to prepare us for the oncoming
[1:13:00] storm to get us ready for 24 and what
[1:13:06] would your theme be for
[1:13:10] 24 I was telling the church early that
[1:13:14] there'll be a lot of things
[1:13:17] exposed God's going to take the cover
[1:13:19] off a lot of
[1:13:21] stuff and it's already began to take the
[1:13:25] cover off a lot of
[1:13:30] things secrets of men Hearts is going to
[1:13:33] be made
[1:13:36] manifested if you're walking and you got
[1:13:39] dark things and things coming it's going
[1:13:42] to come to the
[1:13:44] light let's get it right
[1:13:48] now because things will come into the
[1:13:50] light some things going to be very
[1:13:52] painful
[1:13:54] it's going to
[1:13:56] hurt but you need to come on in the
[1:13:58] light
[1:14:01] now cuz if you don't do it God going to
[1:14:04] do
[1:14:11] it 5 and 12 1 Thessalonians 5 and 12
[1:14:17] says I beseech excuse
[1:14:22] me
[1:14:30] I beseech you Brethren to know them
[1:14:33] which lab among
[1:14:45] you you know
[1:14:47] something to know them that labor among
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:54] and are
[1:14:56] over you in the H in the
[1:15:01] Lord to
[1:15:03] admonish and to esteem them very
[1:15:07] what highly in love for their Works
[1:15:13] sake and be at peace among
[1:15:22] yourselves
[1:15:26] I'm trying to get somewhere but let me
[1:15:28] go back to Ephesians
[1:15:45] 5 Ephesians 5 excuse me and
[1:15:52] 12
[1:16:03] it says for it is
[1:16:04] shame even to speak of those things
[1:16:07] which have done in to them in secret but
[1:16:11] all things that are reproved are made
[1:16:13] manifested by the light for whatsoever
[1:16:16] does make manifest his
[1:16:18] light wherefore he says
[1:16:22] what
[1:16:23] awake thou that sleepeth and
[1:16:26] what and Christ
[1:16:29] shall see then that you
[1:16:32] what walk circumspectly not as fools but
[1:16:36] what doing
[1:16:39] what for the
[1:16:41] what the days of evil you believe that
[1:16:45] now let's go back to Thessalonians
[1:16:48] five and
[1:16:52] three
[1:16:53] Thessalonians 5
[1:17:00] and3
[1:17:04] good I'm having a a time
[1:17:08] here it says for when they shall say
[1:17:14] what peace and safety sudden
[1:17:18] what as travail of the woman with a
[1:17:21] child and they shall
[1:17:23] what but ye Brethren are not
[1:17:27] what that that
[1:17:35] day I'm telling
[1:17:38] you it's getting it's getting pretty
[1:17:44] serious and I
[1:17:46] thought that these scriptures would
[1:17:49] ankle down inside of me that these that
[1:17:54] day would not catch you as a
[1:17:57] thief but I'm afraid that the spiritual
[1:18:05] condition of
[1:18:07] most when I look at myself and I say God
[1:18:10] where am
[1:18:12] I where am
[1:18:15] I this where I want to
[1:18:20] be is this the spiritual condition I
[1:18:23] want to be
[1:18:26] in I know some people jump shout and put
[1:18:29] on the big front a big
[1:18:33] show like they got it
[1:18:37] all but

[1:18:44] want the talk to
[1:18:48] talk but I want to walk to
[1:18:51] Walk
