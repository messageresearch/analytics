just now today and oh god you would help us to be reconciled to you oh god we can be a blessing to your people thank you lord jesus father for we love you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god is good amen you love the lord this morning hey man let's get a lot of hand clapping praise it god is good amen let's look at the book of romans by god's grace try not to keep me long this morning romans and we'll begin at romans 12. excuse me romans 14 and we'll begin at the 12th verse romans 14 and 12. we got it say amen and it reads let's let's begin here at the at the 10th verse and it reads but why does thou judge thy brother why does thou set and not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us all every one of us shall give account to of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather no man put a stumbling block on occasion to fall in in his brother's way may god bless you arena of his word you may be seated this morning by god's grace just for a moment i want to minister to you on a topic on that day amen on that day now we know that here you know paul was addressing some things you know a lot of dressing with dealing with certain things you eat and all these things and clean and unclean but you know i just want to look here at how you know he says you know to the people you're saying you know i don't want you to judge you know your brother or say that not in one another anymore he says because the days what's going to come he said that we all was going to have to stand before the judgment seat of god and he says that when you stand before the judgment seat of god every man was going to have to give an account come on for his own life how many believe that this morning so i says you know he was saying you know don't a man have to answer for himself you know sometimes we look at like we said on that day you know we look at sometimes as a minister you know uh or even as a christian sometimes you get frustrated i say it like that when people make bad decisions or you see people do things that's unlike the word of god or you see people make decisions that you know that god doesn't like sometimes it frustrates you come on because of the scene of the other reason it frustrates you or it hurts you because you love that person come on and you looking not just necessarily at the decision that they made but you're looking at the after effects or the long-term consequence consequences that that person will have to face because of the decision they made and sometimes we can that we've been through certain things in life even you try to tell your children sometimes because you've been there come on and you know what the outcome is going to be so it hurts you sometimes when you see them make certain decisions or go down certain paths so you might sometimes fuss at them or do other things but it ain't out of it ain't out of because you judging them or don't like them but it's because of love come on you know the bible jesus said one place he says many he love he do what he rebuke and he chasteneth you know oh how god loves us that he don't let us stay in the condition we are and sin and wall in it but he'll he'll do things to us to chastise us and all because he loves us you know they they sing a song he meant it for my good come on the devil meant it for bad but i'm so glad that god meant it for my good come on we look at the sometimes the chastisement or the present sufferings and all these things and we wonder why but we know that they're not to be compared to the glory that god is going to reveal in you when when when the end is come come on when god is done with you then you could look back like joseph when he looked at his brothers he said yes you did it for evil and he says i i might have been through some things come on i might have had to suffer some hardships but he says god meant it for good come on i can see the hand of the lord in it all come on and that's what it is you don't just uh come into a maturity i believe that overnight but it's a road it's a path to some places that god takes you to get you to that place of maturity to get you to that place of character where he can set you up to rule how many believe that this morning but i says that that's why sometimes it hurts you you know because of love and i was told many times on many occasions that that you know i was too sensitive come on or i get too emotional i get too uh in intertwined with others and i says you know i can't i can't help it sometimes come on because in my heart i want to see everybody make it in my heart i want to see everybody save come on and i believe that if you're a real christian today you don't have to just be a minister but that would be in your heart as well not to look down on one another but to always be in prayer for somebody come on lord they might have fallen but god help them get back up lord though their foot fell lord help them to find that place of stability come on lord don't let them perish come on sign crime brother abomination done in the city not god bring judgment but god have mercy god forgive them lord open their eyes to the condition that they're in and help them lord to see the light come on how many want that this morning so we find that i said on that day come on i said you know as a minister you you it bothers you sometimes but you know you realize that it's your job and not only as a minister but as the head of your household and your order over your children all that as a brother or sister it's your job to do what to to preach the word i'll say that in season and out of season come on give the people the word of god come on let them know so then you know it says but overall the choice they make is going to be between them and god i thought about ministering a sermon once between you and god because in the end you know we can give you the word come on we can lay all these things before you but the choice that you make when it's laid before you is going to be between you and god in the end somebody said that them and god got something worked out well that's between you and god come on but i know one thing come on we all going to be judged by the same thing how many believe that this morning and that's going to be the word of god no matter what family you're from no matter what church you belong to all these things the word of god is going to be the one that judges and when that word is come before you i don't know about you but i want to be right with god i want to say lord i fought a good fight come on i finished my course i kept the faith hallelujah come on i say keep the faith this morning yes sometimes you get to that point the way you want to throw your hands up but you got to keep the faith come on nevertheless how many believe that this morning but we find that i said on that date you know thinking about that i said it's the choice that's going it's between you and the choice you make is between you and god but i like how he says that he says for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god come on every knee gonna bow and every tongue gonna confess to god come on it ain't that a man that you gotta answer to no man but you're gonna have to answer to god one day not answer to your husband or wife church you're gonna have to answer to god one day for the choice that you made come on when you answer to god i said lord when i answer to you i want to say lord i did my best i did all that you asked me to do to the best of my ability lord i might have uh stumbled sometime along the way but i did the best i could come on sometimes and what are we doing sometimes we doing the best we can come on with what we got and that's all god asks you to do he knows that what you capable of come on and that's why he he expects certain things out of you come on some people that you say god will god let them come on because god know what they're capable of and god know what you're capable of too much is given come on god gonna require more cheney and that's what it is give god like sister irene used to sing give god all you got come on everything that god has given you give it back to god i believe the bible says if we live we live unto the lord come on and if we die we die unto the lord either way we belong to god come on so whatever you got give it to god come on give god all you god hallelujah oh jesus i said lord i want to give you all i got lord bless you come on tremendously don't he come on give it to god come on god bless you with children give them to god come on god bless you abundantly give it to god and let god show you off to the world come on not that you stand and say what you've got or what you've achieved but you can say i am that i am come on by what the grace of god i'm only here before you by the grace of god somebody said you always talking about grace because i can't get away from it i i know come on i know that i'm only where i'm at because of what god is doing i know i'm only here before you because of god's mercy and grace of my life so how can i get away from the grace of god how can i get away from the love of god and all he's done for me how can i get away from it oh jesus i said on that day come on what it is he says that we all gonna have to he said so everyone of us shall give an account of himself to god come on you're gonna have to give an account of yourself to god you know it says that you know it uh many gonna come you know he was saying jesus talked about i think it was in matthew uh 20 24 i believe well matthew 12 or 24 or one of them but he says that many on that day he said it in a couple places he said they was going to come and they was going to say lord lord come on didn't we do many things wonderful works in your name and he said that he was going to declare under the part for me you that work iniquity come on i ain't never knew you come on on that day i says on that day when we come to that place you know it said it said that on that day that your thoughts will speak louder than your words come on the thing you thought in your heart don't you know god is still revealing the secrets of the heart and that's what god judges us by i think about sarah and how you know when the when the angels and all came and how they began to speak to the lord began to speak to abraham about him was going to still give him a child and all and the bible said sarah laughed in her heart didn't it and said that she said shall i have pleasure with my lord in my old age and all of a sudden you know he began to speak he said why did sarah laugh come on she said lord i ain't loud he said yes but you did laugh come on he mighta didn't come out of her mouth but her heart what was in her heart spoke louder than what came out her mouth come on and that's what god judged her by and that's what we find i'm so glad that god judges the heart come on because a lot of times if we were judged by the outward appearance many people on the outward might not look like come on that they're right might not look like that they worthy come on they even be called a son or daughter of god but like he says don't judge one another who are you the judge come on god is looking deep down in that person's heart that's why somebody he says don't put don't cast a stumbling block don't count a brother not anymore he said don't do those things he said because god is going to judge him come on in the end they don't have to answer god you might account that person not but in that person's heart they was crying out for help they was crying out for mercy they were saying lord if i can only make it to the house of god hallelujah and that's what god was judged i thank god for that hallelujah that if we look many times on the outward appearance but god looking in the heart come on looking at the outward appearance with saul and david come on saul david looked like he did way worse than saul did come on but god looking at david he said he's a man after my own heart come on because he knew that in david's heart come on david would repent come on given the chance david would make things right and that's what it is sometime i said in your hearts come on he says many times they confess me with with their mouth but their heart is far from me come on it don't matter what you say out your mouth sometimes where is your heart in my heart lord i want to serve you in my heart lord i want to be right lord in my heart i want to praise you lord in my heart i want to give you thanks lord hallelujah god judges those things i'm so glad come on that he searches the heart and he tried the reigns when i was deep in sin hallelujah god saw my heart god knew that if i can get loose from the chains that was holding me if i can break free from the depression that had me bound hallelujah i would give them praise so he extended grace to me hallelujah oh jesus he made a way out of no way he opened doors hallelujah somebody looked at you and they say how can you make it hallelujah how'd you get where you are only by the grace of god he saw what was in my heart hallelujah he knew that if he took the shackles off my hands i'd praise him hallelujah he knew if he gave me a voice i say thank you jesus i testify tell somebody of the goodness of jesus hallelujah i say give god all you got come on if you got a voice praise god come on if god took the shackles off your hands worship god hallelujah oh jesus come on ain't god good come on ain't god so good come on you you listen to those things sometime and say god is so good come on he's been so good to me hallelujah he's been gooder gooder than good hallelujah better than good god is so good to us over and over again isn't it but i said on that day come on on that day you know you'll be it said like it says your thoughts speak louder than your words come on you know and that's what that's what happens we look at sometimes situations and all and i like how you talking about judgment come on we know that judgment begins in the house of god come on but what it is it's the word judging hallelujah it's the word showing us where we're right where we're wrong come on and it isn't that you in line with rules and regulations but you line up with the word of god come on you find certain things in the word sometimes that might be hard that might be cutting but you say lord whatever it is come on let the potter mold your life come on let the potter shape you make you come on until what he desires of you we got many ambitions and goals of what we want to be come on but let god let god shape you let god make you come on lord what will thou have me to do i want to be whatever you want me to be i want to do god whatever you want me to do come on and that's what it is it reminds me we're saying you know that how god look at the heart you know i'll tell you how how powerful the lord is you know i always tell a testimony how we went down me and brother carl once went down the black bottom they call it down in orangeburg and how we were out witnessing and we went up to a drug house and you know and brother carl got out the car and went in the back and and then he was out there talking to the people about the lord come on and all of a sudden it was when we got back to the car it was a man at the drug house in a full suit come on it was on a sunday afternoon he had a full suit on and he says that i got dressed to go to church this morning but i ain't never make it come on and it did something to our hearts in such a way that we went on park the car and got out in the middle of the street and began praying for this man and i believe that even though he found himself and at the drug house on a sunday morning i believe god knew what was in that man's heart i believe that man's heart cry hallelujah broke past where he was at broke past the condition the way he was at and though he couldn't make it god was willing hallelujah to send somebody by his way to talk to him about the goodness of jesus to bring church to where he was hallelujah not only church but prayer hallelujah and that don't you don't you think the lord come on he's just like that come on he knows what's in the heart god that's why you want to be available for god to use you come on and even if you can't make it to the house of god sometimes you still got a crowd lord i desire to be in your house lord i desire for your help lord i desire for your mercy i believe god are here from heaven hallelujah and he'll send somebody by your way hallelujah oh jesus don't that excite you come on to know that every time you you pray god is listening come on and that's why the devil don't want you to pray because he knows that when you start praying come on he'll tell you oh you ain't in the condition to pray come on try to discourage you but you know one thing about it god knows that come on but what's in your heart come on all you got to do is cry cry out hallelujah i believe samson even in his condition he had it in his heart that there was a possibility that if i cry out maybe the lord hear me come on i know i'm wrong i know where i'm at but if i cry out loud enough jonah in the wells fish belly hallelujah deep down in he said from the belly of hell i cried god heard him from the belly of hell didn't he from the depths of hell god heard him i say this morning crowd hallelujah ask god what you have need make your petition known and let's see what god will do hallelujah oh jesus somebody give god praise this morning i said on that day come on on that day you know paul here speaking about it and as many other scriptures i want to go to this morning but i just for the sake of time i said on that day you know we find that i said everything we do in this life come on it's leading up to something come on it's leading up leading up to what to the end to that day come on to that day when you have to stand before god and then when we get to that point i says you know there ain't nothing uh certain in this life come on it's not you ain't even certain that you'll leave here and go home today come on ain't even certain that you'll go home and cook you'll even be here tomorrow that's not certain come on but there's one thing that's certain one thing that's for sure one day you're gonna have to meet god and you're gonna have to give an account for the life that you live the bible talked about it whether it be good or whether it be evil the things you've done in this body you'll have to give an account form that's one thing that we do know come on that will have to meet god one day but when that day comes come on i said you can live a you can live a good life come on and it ain't so much about the beginning that's not what we're dealing with because we know that we were born in sin come on in iniquity that our mother conceived we were born wrong come on we were born lost born in this world without god and without uh a savior come on but nevertheless that's why he came and he died hallelujah and he shed his blood sent back the holy ghost now all that are far off as many as the lord our god should call that if they obey them and repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins he didn't say i might do it but he said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost well who is that for that's for you and to your children hallelujah to your children's children we'll say it like that the media is our lord god shall call whosoever will let him come hallelujah oh jesus come on he made a way of escape so he says that you know it's not so much the beginning hallelujah not so much what all was done in the middle but when you come down to the end come on when it comes down to that time the way you got to cross over come on on that day hallelujah only thing that'll matter come on is being right with god all of the we says that you know all of the the little things they'll come back before you one day come on the little unconfessed sins the little lies come on the little cheating the little the little things hallelujah they'll be big on that day how many believe that this morning but we find that hallelujah i said lord when i come to that room to that place lord stand by me hallelujah i don't want to talk about all the good i've done because it has filthy rice but god on that day i want you to stand by me lord hallelujah vouch for me hallelujah oh jesus you know one one song i heard once uh he took my place come on down at a at a gospel uh choir concert to my sister once and they were singing that song he took my place come on and all of a sudden tears started coming down my eyes because i said what it is i only i can only live because he lived hallelujah i'm only can overcome because he overcame he went in my place come on he died for me it's got to be personal he died for you this morning come on he took your place why are you sad why are you weeping hallelujah oh the lion the tribe of judah he has prevailed for us this morning he took your place hallelujah so when you come to the end of the road it ain't nothing that you've done or what you could have did but it's all in him hallelujah and what he done for you he took your place oh jesus took your place but i said all those things come on when we come down when we come down to the end come on on that day all those things will be big i remember you know brother simmons as he was talking to my sister before she passed away i ain't had the words to say but i remember him telling her he says you know because she said she was ready come on he began to tell her well nothing else matters now come on but love whatever it come on because nothing short of perfect love is going to enter there come on so all that everything else nothing no matter right now come on on that day hallelujah you want to have love in your heart on that day you don't want no trouble at the river but you want all things that's why it says to be you ready because you don't know when the lord calling you you don't know hallelujah but be ready hallelujah oh jesus i said everything we do in this life is leading up to something come on leading up to that day to where you have to meet god how many believe that i said on that day i remember you know seeing many that was that was leaving here come on and nothing else matter come on when it came down to that point nothing mattered what was going to happen tomorrow didn't matter what happened yesterday didn't matter but only they mattered was will he accept me come on will i be accepted i was talking with an uncle of mine and i was telling him before he passed away i said you know i said uncle i said i said uh think about all the money you had think about all the calls you had cause i remember him at his height think about all of the good times so-called that you had come on i said what does that mean now he told me it didn't mean nothing all he wanted to hear about was jesus all he wanted to do was call me jermaine jermaine pray with me come on that's all that mattered when he got down to the end hallelujah come on i says that you nobody left with a testimony come on i remember him saying he was in the hospital and he looked over and he began to tell the people my mother and his daughter he could see himself as a young man standing in the corner he said look that's me right there you know and they just confused at first but he was he was happy he was happy he could see himself come on but that's what it is and i believe that you know he went on with the lord but i want to say that that's what it is on that day come on you'll know come on why because i says you know the prophet of god is talking about in one place it won't be nothing new you'll hear come on as you reach that judgment seat but what voice will you hear the voice of the ministers who cried out in your hour come on the pastor the preacher come on mom and daddy that pleaded with you come on every day give your life to god come on plead it with you get right come on plead it with you love the lord with all of your heart plead it with you come on build a relationship with god plead it with you get down on your knees and cry out let god fill you with the holy ghost plead it with you these things don't matter let them go please with you hallelujah those are the voices that you'll hear again you'll know then hallelujah the decision that you make god won't have to judge you hallelujah oh how many believe that this morning but you'll find there'll be many on that day hallelujah when they have to cross over they'll hear that voice and they'll know then that they made the right choice they'll hear that voice they'll say hey i might have couldn't come in walking i was crawling beat down by the trials of this life but i made it in somebody said i rolled in the wheelchair but i made it in somebody said i didn't have the best house i didn't have no money in the bank but i made it in hallelujah i didn't have the world and the riches i went through some things in life but nevertheless i made it in oh jesus i made it i pressed and i fought hallelujah now i laid up a crown of light come on and you'll hear the lord enter on into the jaws of the lord you made it hallelujah not because of nothing you've done hallelujah i gave you strength when all your strength was gone come on i supplied all your knees come on oh jesus how many believe that this morning let us stand this morning somebody praise god this morning i said on that day come on are you ready for that day come on he says he said don't judge one another he said don't count it not your brother don't throw stumbling blocks in his way come on he says but on that day how many believe that just paraphrasing it he said every man gonna have to stand before god yes it it bothers you it hurts you many times come on deceive some make the wrong decision that's why you get down on your knees and you pray for them and you ask the lord to restore such a one come on because god if he hadn't had mercy on you you wouldn't be here today come on god hadn't opened your eyes to the revelation of the word and do something supernatural in your life you wouldn't be here today come on none of us would but it was only by what the mercy of god but he says you know every man come on i want you to think about that this morning every man come on what we do in this life one day we're gonna have to see it again decisions in the choice we make it'll meet us again come on i said are you making the right choice this morning let us borrow his on that day lord we thank you this morning for your grace lord in your mercy you know sometimes we preach with all our heart we say things that might seem to be criticizing a judgmental but it's out of love and we say lord that we love your people oh god because we want everyone to be ready on that day in that hour when you call their name i don't know about you brother and sister but i want to be ready come on and i'm depending on jesus to get me ready i'm dependent on the holy ghost hallelujah how many depending on god this morning i said are you depending on jesus this morning come on how many want to raise their hand and say lord i want to be ready on that day lord when i got to give an account for the life that i live when i got to give an account for the things that i heard hallelujah let me be like that man that heard the word of god and he lived because you said that man would be like a wise builder who built this house on a rock hallelujah i believe your word said he dug deep until he hit a rock dig deep this morning dig deep this morning down in your heart dig deep hallelujah it don't stop till you hit the rock don't stop till you find the rock then you can build hallelujah and when the winds blow when the rains fall hallelujah the house will stand because
