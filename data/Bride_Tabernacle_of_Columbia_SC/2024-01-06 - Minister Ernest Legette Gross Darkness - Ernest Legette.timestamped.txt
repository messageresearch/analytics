[36:49] on on the gross Darkness amen you know
[36:53] just looking at the way the world is
[36:56] going and it it does something sometimes
[36:59] to your spirit you know and I think I
[37:02] believe it's it's God that that open
[37:05] your eyes to certain things and he stirs
[37:09] up like they say sometimes your
[37:10] righteous indignation or whatever they
[37:13] call it but to to look at the way the
[37:16] world is going and and and he says thy
[37:21] light arise and shine for thy light is
[37:23] come but I always said and I was saying
[37:26] it this way for the last several weeks
[37:28] that you know light and darkness they're
[37:31] two different uh entities or things they
[37:35] have no fellowship with each other you
[37:37] know so uh God is forming Earth first
[37:40] thing he said let there be light right
[37:42] cuz Darkness upon the face of the deep
[37:45] who you know the first thing he called
[37:47] for was the light but he separated the
[37:48] two you know that because they can't
[37:51] they can't have fellowship with each
[37:53] other so you know if that light you know
[37:56] he says arise and shine for that light
[37:58] has come you know it even though the
[38:02] prophet Isaiah here was speaking about a
[38:04] time of darkness and gross Darkness but
[38:07] yet he still declared even in that time
[38:10] there would be a little light there but
[38:14] so but as we said that light can't have
[38:16] fellowship with Darkness right so the
[38:19] the the the more the you see the gross
[38:21] Darkness covering the land covering the
[38:24] people that's the more you start finding
[38:26] yourself detached from this world you
[38:29] you should find yourself every day the
[38:32] stuff you see longing for your future
[38:35] home a
[38:37] longing to see the cuz cuz we see the
[38:40] deceptiveness of the hour that's why we
[38:42] thank God for the message we've been
[38:44] studying here lately cuz we think we see
[38:46] the the deceptive deceptiveness of the
[38:49] hour we see the false anointed ones on
[38:52] the rise all over the land and deceive
[38:55] many but he said if it were possible
[38:58] they would have see the very elect so
[39:00] you and I we we take we don't take
[39:02] lightly what God has called us to we
[39:06] don't live that that kind of way any any
[39:08] kind of loosely but we we cherish I
[39:11] believe we should cherish the grace that
[39:14] God has G put on our lives and we should
[39:17] cherish Jesus spoke to them many times
[39:20] he said blessed are your eyes because
[39:21] you see and your ears because you hear
[39:25] many desire to see things and hear them
[39:27] but they don't hear it but it's a
[39:29] blessing so we should cherish these
[39:30] things that we can see the things that
[39:34] God has brought us out of but what it is
[39:37] it it it puts in us uh uh um you know it
[39:41] does something to your spirit it puts in
[39:43] you uh uh something that stir you up
[39:47] that way you see the battle raging you
[39:49] see the darkness that we fighting you
[39:51] see the the hour that we live in and and
[39:54] you got loved ones you got children you
[39:56] got got family you got friends you got
[39:58] all those that their eyes they can't see
[40:00] it they can't you know uh uh uh uh they
[40:02] don't understand it yeah but you pray
[40:05] that God it puts you in you to pray God
[40:08] open their eyes only only the spirit of
[40:11] God as we was ministering the other week
[40:14] God got to show you these things the man
[40:16] only understand these things by the
[40:18] spirit of God just by intellectual
[40:20] knowledge the same man that's maybe
[40:23] quoting it and talking and intellectual
[40:24] knowledge but don't have spiritual eyes
[40:26] to see it he just still in that
[40:29] Darkness a lot of times you'll find him
[40:31] quoting the same the same scriptures
[40:33] speaking the same thing but yet walking
[40:35] in that
[40:37] Darkness yet still walking in that
[40:39] because God by his Spirit hadn't
[40:41] revealed it to me yet but you look at
[40:45] yourself and say who am I Lord but you
[40:47] thank God that cuz what it is some kind
[40:50] of way at one point in your life maybe
[40:53] you saw yourself as being nothing you
[40:55] saw yourself as a sinner needing the
[40:58] grace of God you saw yourself as needing
[41:00] help and you were able to get low enough
[41:02] for God to come down and save you you
[41:06] know you start looking at your own life
[41:07] and and and and even now you said Lord
[41:10] we need you to we need you to to take
[41:13] take control take complete
[41:15] control don't don't allow me Lord at any
[41:18] moment to think I'm in charge Lord you
[41:20] take complete control from every as Lord
[41:23] You Take Control it's to the point you
[41:26] know now you you you just in prayer that
[41:29] that's got to be your main your main
[41:31] Drive prayer God I want to pray I want
[41:36] to I want to pull down strongholds I
[41:38] want to get to that place the way my
[41:40] communion with you is so strong because
[41:43] God I can't fight how else I'm going to
[41:45] fight I got to fight down on my knees
[41:47] many that are walking and more educated
[41:50] more knowledgeable can got more money
[41:52] than you and all these things but yet
[41:53] they walking in darkness but I say God
[41:57] help us and they might genuinely think
[42:00] that they're walking in light genuinely
[42:03] think that they're right and are good
[42:05] people right but you say what happened
[42:09] uh uh but God by his grace through
[42:11] election that's what it is God has
[42:13] elected you AR and you look at those
[42:16] things but I say as we're living in an
[42:17] hour of of not just darkness gross
[42:20] Darkness right Darkness cover the Earth
[42:23] but on the people uh it's a different
[42:26] type of
[42:27] Darkness right Darkness on the Earth but
[42:30] over the people it's a different type of
[42:31] Darkness a gross Darkness you know the
[42:36] people got a great Zeal to come to
[42:39] church but to know the things of God and
[42:42] to really uhh find the will of God for
[42:45] their life or to seek the mysteries of
[42:47] God or to seek the what's to come they
[42:49] don't have a Zeal for
[42:51] that but they have a great this the hour
[42:54] we live in they have a great Zeal to to
[42:56] be church
[42:57] members come on but why because the the
[43:01] Bible says that they'll be rich they say
[43:03] we we rich we increase with good we
[43:05] don't have need of nothing they got a
[43:08] Zeal to come to church but so far as
[43:11] having God like I David you know I
[43:14] always quote it how he says Lord search
[43:16] my heart and try my Reigns I'm I'm the
[43:18] king he the king but he constantly was
[43:20] asking God to search him and try
[43:23] him come on I was think
[43:27] how I believe it was Daniel when he was
[43:30] prophesying he said thou weighed in the
[43:32] F in the in the balance and found
[43:34] W come
[43:36] on but do you have that longing tonight
[43:39] for God to search and try you come on
[43:44] but we find that I says people got a
[43:46] great Zeal to come to
[43:48] church but not to know the not to know
[43:51] the spirit of God not for him to really
[43:55] take hold of their lives you know you
[43:57] think about it uh what it is it's a
[44:00] spirit though cuz you want them to be
[44:03] savior but not Lord save me from the bad
[44:07] times you know when the people going
[44:08] through going through hard times they
[44:11] they'll be the house of God most of them
[44:14] House of God praying you can't beat them
[44:16] you can't beat them being faithful but
[44:18] when things get easy come on I want a
[44:21] savior but I don't want a lord I got it
[44:23] from here I'm in control I got it from
[44:26] here come on but I said Lord what it is
[44:30] God has to take us and Shake us come on
[44:34] and wake us Shake us to The Hour That We
[44:36] Live shake us and let us know you need
[44:39] me now more than you ever did in the and
[44:42] as we looking at the Third Exodus we
[44:44] looking at this time we looking at the
[44:46] me and the boys at work been talking
[44:49] just within the every few years look
[44:52] like the world has went 30 years look
[44:56] like the world has moved centuries look
[44:57] like look like that was centuries ago
[45:00] but that the world was thinking that way
[45:02] but look at how far they've gone from
[45:04] that two years ago look how far it
[45:06] looked like things we only moved you say
[45:08] five years but 5 years ago look at the
[45:11] mindset how the mindset of the children
[45:13] has changed look how the mindset of the
[45:16] the the the the preachers have changed
[45:18] look how the mindset of church look at
[45:20] how the mindset of the people have
[45:22] changed just in that short period of
[45:24] time why cuz things are speeding up
[45:27] ain't it coming on you so fast coming on
[45:29] you moving so fast but I say as the
[45:32] mindset of the people has changed
[45:35] sometimes we ask God by our spirit God I
[45:38] know they're speeding up super fast but
[45:40] God don't let me speed up super fast in
[45:42] that way but slow me down enough that I
[45:44] can hear your
[45:45] voice because they're going into
[45:47] destruction they're going into a dark
[45:50] places they're going to that place but
[45:52] God I don't want to go into that place
[45:54] Slow Me Down enough that I can still
[45:55] still hear your
[45:57] voice Hallelujah I was sharing with
[45:59] somebody I said that's what it is we can
[46:02] be busy busy busy all that's going on
[46:06] and it takes up and then next say you
[46:08] know time gone time gone and you lost
[46:10] control you lost control I was telling
[46:14] somebody say you lost control of your
[46:15] home you lost control of your marriage
[46:17] you lost control because things was you
[46:19] were so busy things are flying you so
[46:21] busy that you lost control what used to
[46:24] be the foundation
[46:26] was God In Prayer Hallelujah putting him
[46:29] first you lost you had too much time you
[46:32] didn't have time to keep him first and
[46:34] if he's not first he can't guide you he
[46:37] can't lead you you out there on your
[46:40] own and if he don't slow you down at
[46:43] some point you'll be too far out there
[46:45] right made a mess of everything
[46:48] Hallelujah but I ask God don't let us do
[46:50] that how many want God to slow them down
[46:53] just a little bit tonight that they can
[46:55] hear his voice but what I say you know
[46:57] we live in that hour people have a great
[46:59] Zeal you see it all over don't you to
[47:01] come to church but but to really know
[47:05] the Deep things of God the really the
[47:09] the real um concern about their their
[47:12] soul salvation I says but you know the
[47:15] further that the the world goes into
[47:18] that realm you know that's the more you
[47:21] and I are going to stand out you know
[47:23] you'll be called crazy and all but but
[47:27] it it would be that the world like we
[47:29] says it' be that the world has lost
[47:31] their minds me and wife was talking cuz
[47:34] we can't get away from these things just
[47:35] the more even uh my wife was saying that
[47:39] she thank God cuz we we we studying this
[47:42] anointed ones at the end time and the
[47:44] people are very manifesting the things
[47:46] we looking at it just open your eyes you
[47:49] seeing it now had you had the Lord not
[47:52] not LED you these ways or or led the
[47:54] church these ways or it exposed these
[47:56] things sometimes you might be caught
[47:58] right up in it cuz you say I know that
[48:00] was God I know yes it was and but yet
[48:03] you caught up in it right but the thing
[48:06] is God has blessed God has blessed you
[48:09] or I come on to see certain things he
[48:13] blessed you and I to have a desire not
[48:15] only just to be a a hearer of the word
[48:18] but it's in your heart to want to do
[48:20] what the will of God is it's in your
[48:22] heart want to please God hallelujah
[48:26] but you find I says you know was looking
[48:29] at some things and I says you know my
[48:32] wife was looking at some things he was
[48:34] showing us some clips of of uh you know
[48:37] what the what the church world doing
[48:39] today you know and they bringing in the
[48:42] New Year certain way right you know and
[48:46] they but the way they're going is
[48:48] literally I mean I mean literally the
[48:51] club in the church
[48:52] literally it used to be you know they
[48:55] say just the
[48:56] rap gospel whatever they call it but now
[48:58] it ain't that it's just we going full
[49:00] blast everything we letting it all go we
[49:03] going to turn up
[49:04] tonight I said how does God look at that
[49:08] come on but they going going in but the
[49:12] the thing that that that that you look
[49:15] at is the people have no conscience
[49:18] people have no no um no consciousness
[49:22] word I want to I want but they have no
[49:26] it's no shame to it they have no nothing
[49:28] that tells them on the inside that this
[49:31] is
[49:33] wrong nothing to check
[49:36] them you look at they they do wrong and
[49:40] and they done it for so long the Bible
[49:42] says that when they knew God in Romans
[49:45] they worshiped him not as God come
[49:47] on see he said since they didn't like
[49:50] him to retain them in their knowledge he
[49:51] turned them over to his repivate mind
[49:53] the way they'll do these things and have
[49:55] no conscience they even know that this
[49:58] is
[49:59] wrong was talking at work the other day
[50:01] he says you know how how a dad in a home
[50:05] we was listening to somebody talk about
[50:07] uh uh the kind of how he want his the
[50:10] men to approach his daughters and how he
[50:13] want his daughter to marry a real man
[50:16] and how he talks to his young girls and
[50:19] how you know uh uh how they should
[50:22] consider this man you lay down with or
[50:25] man is is he going to be a real man
[50:27] that's not going to walk out on you is
[50:29] he going to be somebody you ra you want
[50:30] to you can see raising children a he was
[50:33] just going on and on but do you know the
[50:36] criticism that just by him talking like
[50:39] that the world bring on him
[50:42] today but what it is we've accepted the
[50:46] wrong for so
[50:49] long that when a man stand you and tell
[50:52] you what's right it's wrong now he he's
[50:55] wrong he's crazy that's what they do
[50:58] with the Natural Things even with the
[51:00] the spirit it is you've accepted the
[51:03] wrong for so long now and like we said
[51:05] it hadn't been long but it's been put in
[51:07] the minds of the
[51:08] people that now you wrong you're wrong
[51:13] but I
[51:15] says wrong is still wrong and right is
[51:19] still right no matter how everybody say
[51:23] let's change everybody say this is well
[51:25] everybody say well everybody else is
[51:27] doing it wrong is wrong and right is
[51:30] right come on and that ain't going to
[51:32] change y'all believe that tonight but
[51:36] just now they say you know you look at
[51:40] where where are the real I I was saying
[51:43] that the children they going to be
[51:45] confused because the same one somebody
[51:48] and wife was showing me some something
[51:50] where this great
[51:51] anointed
[51:53] singer anointed people got testimonies
[51:57] no no doubt under her
[52:00] Ministry but she's she's telling I'm
[52:03] standing on the Bible I'm standing on
[52:05] the word and everything she said sounded
[52:08] so
[52:12] good standing against this and standing
[52:14] against that everything she said sounded
[52:16] real good but at the same time you
[52:19] Pastor in a church and you're standing
[52:21] up there with pants on in the pull pit
[52:24] come on
[52:27] but don't say nothing you can't judge
[52:29] them come on who are you to judge and
[52:32] that's right but judgment begins where
[52:35] in the house of God right you don't have
[52:38] to judge the thing is you don't judge
[52:40] them but one day the very word you claim
[52:42] to be standing on going to judge you one
[52:45] day the very word the Bible you claim to
[52:48] be standing on that same word one day
[52:50] gonna judge
[52:51] you come on the same one you claim to
[52:54] love and that you serving and you
[52:56] worship you had a Zeal to come to church
[52:58] that same one one day G to say depart
[53:00] from me I never knew you he won't deny
[53:04] you didn't do the works come
[53:07] on but you left something out what was
[53:11] it you didn't wholly follow him come on
[53:15] like Joshua and Caleb they wholly
[53:16] followed the Lord not just when the
[53:19] times were good but in when when the
[53:22] odds were against them they still wholly
[53:24] follow the Lord hallelujah oh Jesus but
[53:28] we find that that's the hour we live in
[53:30] it it it it does it ought to when you
[53:33] see certain things it's not to laugh at
[53:36] not to laugh and make cuz it ain't funny
[53:39] it does something to your spirit come on
[53:43] I can see Jesus he walked into Jerusalem
[53:46] and saw what they was doing selling and
[53:47] buying in the temple it did something to
[53:50] him come on he ran them out didn't he
[53:54] because it bothered him how they was
[53:57] doing what they were doing in God's
[53:59] house come on and it started from the
[54:02] pool pit didn't it it started with the
[54:05] leaders allowing it to come in there
[54:07] didn't it
[54:10] Hallelujah but I says that this is the
[54:13] hour it ought to do something to you I
[54:15] said what it is the children going to be
[54:17] confused cuz the same preacher or the
[54:20] same person that's talking about
[54:21] Holiness and all they don't know what it
[54:23] is come come on you can't tell them no
[54:27] different from what the word word the
[54:29] the world is come on my wife is showing
[54:33] me something where they done took praise
[54:35] dancing to a whole another level
[54:37] now my wife said praise dancing would
[54:40] have been better to suffer that what
[54:41] they she showed me the other
[54:44] day but leave them alone come
[54:49] on we got the youth in
[54:51] church come
[54:53] on but there'll be
[54:56] confused to know what a real God is come
[55:00] on Hallelujah but I says Lord help us
[55:05] God as gross darkness is covering the
[55:07] the people Darkness Earth gross darkness
[55:10] is covering the people you still said
[55:12] that there be light
[55:13] somewhere I want to be in that light I
[55:16] want to walk in that light many think
[55:19] they walk in it but they Ain still in
[55:21] darkness many thinking they walk in it
[55:23] but they still living in darkness
[55:26] eyes are blind why the hour the Bible
[55:28] declared this hour would be like that
[55:30] you say you have need of nothing but you
[55:32] wouldn't know the condition your life
[55:33] was in come on in the eyes of God you
[55:36] didn't see
[55:38] yourself but he says come unto me and
[55:41] bow me eyes come
[55:44] on I mean buy me gold tried in the Fire
[55:47] come on let me give you eyes to anoint
[55:49] your eyes that you might be able to see
[55:52] God want to show you the condition your
[55:54] life is in
[55:55] in come on everything is Right
[55:58] everything is well no God want to show
[56:01] you the condition your life is in the
[56:04] richest man in the world miserable naked
[56:07] blind all these things God want to show
[56:09] you the condition your life is in
[56:11] Hallelujah I'm so glad that God showed
[56:14] me the condition that my life was in
[56:17] come on the road that you were on one
[56:19] day and you still ask God today try me
[56:22] search me show me where I'm at God come
[56:25] on I said what it is we got to get back
[56:28] to those midnight prayers those midnight
[56:31] crying that's the place where God we
[56:34] found him at got to get back to that but
[56:35] what it is something got to stir you up
[56:37] to get there something got to push you
[56:39] there something got to get you you know
[56:42] you could preach it people can try to
[56:44] manufacture
[56:46] it it's got to be God do
[56:49] it it's got to be God dealing with
[56:52] individual lives putting it on your
[56:55] heart to seek his face it's got to be
[56:57] God to do something in you to let you
[56:59] know get away from certain things come
[57:02] on and come back to me it's got to be
[57:05] God do
[57:06] that preachers can preach it yell out it
[57:09] cry out it people say oh that's just him
[57:11] mad with him but one day I always feel
[57:15] that that you we no new voice you hear
[57:18] on that day but the same preachers that

[1:03:15] don't care I still love him because I
[1:03:17] know he's anointed of God and it might

[1:03:48] amen praise God he said consider your
[1:03:52] ways
[1:03:53] amen and I thank God that we can
[1:03:55] consider in 24 you know I thought about
[1:03:58] why he was preaching and my wife showed
[1:04:02] me something a while back Bishop
[1:04:06] Patterson he was over the Church of God
[1:04:08] in Christ and he had cancer and I think
[1:04:12] he was well he didn't have long to
[1:04:14] live and then he started telling the
[1:04:17] people about the makeup the
[1:04:21] earrings and uh pants and all of that
[1:04:24] things that had come in the
[1:04:26] church and he was saying you need to get
[1:04:30] back to
[1:04:31] Holiness and
[1:04:33] um I thought about him crying out
[1:04:37] Holiness you know people say you don't
[1:04:39] need a prophet I believe we need
[1:04:43] something some something that that God's
[1:04:46] going to judge
[1:04:48] man people might have thought they
[1:04:50] didn't need a Moses they didn't need a
[1:04:52] Joshua they didn't need Jeremiah they
[1:04:55] didn't need
[1:04:56] a they didn't need a Peter they didn't
[1:04:58] need a Paul but we need
[1:05:02] somebody thank God that he had seven
[1:05:06] stars in his
[1:05:07] hand and I'm glad that those he had a
[1:05:11] messenger for each age I'm glad in this
[1:05:14] last age
[1:05:16] that when you see the star and you
[1:05:18] comeing to worship him not the star but
[1:05:21] you come to worship
[1:05:23] Him the stars is only to lead you to
[1:05:27] where he
[1:05:28] is he's the word amen so we thank God
[1:05:33] and then I thought
[1:05:34] about one of the paay sisters I think
[1:05:37] that's the right name she was dine she'd
[1:05:41] come down she was they she started off
[1:05:45] they were just holding it people no
[1:05:47] makeup no their rigns you know singing
[1:05:51] and they got popular and got way out
[1:05:53] there next thing you know they had the
[1:05:55] make cuff the earring they was shining
[1:05:58] and
[1:05:58] showing at the end of the road she was
[1:06:02] dying and she said about in hell and she
[1:06:06] said I want to tell y'all sisters you
[1:06:07] know she took up all the makeup and all
[1:06:11] the earrings and all the fancy stuff
[1:06:14] talking about you need to go back to
[1:06:17] Holiness you see when it comes down to
[1:06:20] that people know that God is a holy God
[1:06:25] and telling them and warning them you
[1:06:27] don't want to face God all painted up
[1:06:30] and stuff like that telling them about
[1:06:33] it but now people don't know when you
[1:06:37] cross
[1:06:38] over I often time talk about the dream I
[1:06:41] had when I was a little boy and the
[1:06:43] prophet of God said he had that when he
[1:06:45] was dying he was on death bed and he
[1:06:47] woke up in hell and I was telling mine
[1:06:50] all the time I said I was in Hell one
[1:06:52] time and and I didn't know the prophet
[1:06:55] had the same type of experience until I
[1:06:59] started looking into the message and I
[1:07:01] heard him tell about when he was in Hell
[1:07:04] about the long fingernails and the women
[1:07:06] with the long fingernails and they was
[1:07:09] cl and it I said wonder why he saw women
[1:07:13] wonder why I saw women I don't know
[1:07:15] could have saw men but I didn't you know
[1:07:18] what I'm saying and um you were like
[1:07:22] witches in the yeah and people don't
[1:07:25] mind looking like a witch
[1:07:27] now but he said I
[1:07:29] saw and he saw
[1:07:32] that vision of of the Bride of the USA
[1:07:36] and the he he said they was dancing they
[1:07:39] was rocking going to rock and roll music
[1:07:42] and they were being led by
[1:07:45] witch and this he said this is the Bride
[1:07:47] of
[1:07:49] USA dancing to rock and roll music and
[1:07:53] being led by a
[1:07:55] witch I believe we'll come to that
[1:07:58] time like brother Ernest said it was
[1:08:01] dancing and the rap and all of that and
[1:08:04] dancing bringing the New Year in in the
[1:08:06] church have we gone that
[1:08:09] far I believe we
[1:08:12] have and don't don't you think within
[1:08:16] yourself that you have Abraham of your
[1:08:19] father don't you think that you're safe
[1:08:21] because you're in the message uhuh
[1:08:24] you ain't
[1:08:26] safe praise God oh we safe we in oh that
[1:08:31] don't cover you it's only you as an
[1:08:33] individual the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:35] covered in your
[1:08:36] life cuz I see some things you might
[1:08:39] have long dresses and no makeup and all
[1:08:41] of that but I see some
[1:08:43] stuff some hidden stuff it's going to
[1:08:46] come to the
[1:08:47] light people don't mind coming
[1:08:50] out you know people can be married two
[1:08:53] and three times you know done all kind
[1:08:57] of crazy stuff get up in the pullit and
[1:08:59] preach like nothing
[1:09:00] happened people
[1:09:03] hey travel the
[1:09:05] world just as lost as can be people
[1:09:09] listening to him I said Lord have mercy
[1:09:12] you know that person ought to be sitting
[1:09:13] down somewhere and they going on Anin it
[1:09:16] going on I said I'll be as sham of
[1:09:19] myself you know brother and sisters
[1:09:24] it come a time when people don't feel
[1:09:26] that
[1:09:27] repentance they're not afraid that they
[1:09:30] might be exposed they're go
[1:09:32] on but the prophet said it come a time
[1:09:34] it to be anit and seice days
[1:09:37] again people going to see that happen
[1:09:40] again a lot of people think we ready for
[1:09:43] that I don't know what we're ready for
[1:09:46] that but I believe it's got to come to
[1:09:49] pass for the church to get in
[1:09:52] order and who who knows things might
[1:09:55] might be already started and already
[1:09:57] gone taking place but people don't know
[1:10:00] that's why this is why that happened
[1:10:02] this is why that happened people don't
[1:10:06] know but God can make it sure because
[1:10:10] nobody would want to say
[1:10:12] that you know just like taking communion
[1:10:17] this caus many asleep sick and sleep
[1:10:20] among
[1:10:21] you because you're taking
[1:10:25] unworthy are you with
[1:10:28] me so what happens when people think
[1:10:31] they're getting by oh brother Simmons
[1:10:33] ought to do something about it
[1:10:35] no got somebody greater than brother
[1:10:39] Simmons oh the pastor ought to do oh you
[1:10:42] got somebody greater than
[1:10:44] that you can get a man and man can
[1:10:47] come being a bulldog or in the pull pit
[1:10:51] and going on like he's somebody and
[1:10:53] somebody uhuh this is collected thing

[1:11:16] your house your children your family
