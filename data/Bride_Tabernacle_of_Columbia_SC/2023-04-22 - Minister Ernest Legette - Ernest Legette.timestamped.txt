[38:57] want to minister on holding fast the
[38:59] confidence amen
[39:01] and a sub-topic the witness
[39:05] holding fast the confidence with a
[39:08] subtopic of the witness
[39:10] Hebrews 3
[39:13] by the grace of God
[39:15] he got it tonight Say Amen
[39:18] and it reads wherefore our holy Brethren
[39:21] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[39:23] consider the Apostle and high Priests of
[39:25] our profession Christ Jesus who was
[39:27] faithful to him that appointed him also
[39:32] as also Moses was faithful in all his
[39:35] house for this man was counted worthy of
[39:39] more Glory than Moses as much as he who
[39:42] hath build it the house had more honor
[39:45] than the house you may be seated I'ma
[39:47] read a little further down
[39:49] for every house is built it by some man
[39:53] but he that built all things is God Amen
[39:57] I like that says every house was builted
[40:00] by some man but he that built all things
[40:02] is God
[40:03] we were saying the other night in in the
[40:05] Bible study that you know we served this
[40:08] great God don't we
[40:09] God I says that sometimes you can go out
[40:12] and look into certain uh creations of
[40:16] nature we call it Creations but certain
[40:18] things of Nature and and it just odds
[40:20] you or looks at you and it just makes
[40:22] you feel a certain way within yourself
[40:24] because then you know you look at it and
[40:27] it makes you feel like you you may be
[40:29] this big
[40:30] and then you think about you know the
[40:33] little statue that you are and how great
[40:35] the God is that created these things it
[40:39] says that he that created all things as
[40:40] God so you sometimes you you have those
[40:43] moments and then God you know you feel
[40:45] just how small you are compared to how
[40:48] great God is and you know it looks like
[40:51] it's it's sometimes a big gap between
[40:54] you and God in which it is his Holiness
[40:57] and righteousness his thoughts is not
[41:00] our thoughts his ways are not always
[41:01] right they're higher than us but yet
[41:04] even in that one of the great things
[41:06] about God is he knows how to condense
[41:09] sin he knows how to come down you know
[41:12] from off of that place where he is and
[41:14] come down to the oppressed come down to
[41:17] the the meek and the lowly come down to
[41:19] those that that are in need of them and
[41:22] that's what that's the Glorious thing
[41:24] about God he that sitting so high got
[41:26] that ability to come and and be so low
[41:29] ain't your thing ain't you thankful for
[41:31] that tonight amen so God is so good he
[41:34] says that he that built all things of
[41:37] God and Moses was very rarely faithful
[41:39] in all his house as a servant for the
[41:41] testimony of those things which were to
[41:43] be spoken after but Christ as a son over
[41:48] his own house whose house are we if we
[41:52] hold fast to confidence and the and the
[41:55] rejoicing of the Hope firm Until the End
[41:58] remember we talking about holding fast
[42:00] the confidence now he says that we are
[42:02] part of God's house if we hold fast the
[42:05] confidence and be firm steadfast firm
[42:08] until what Until the End right because
[42:12] it doesn't matter some people can run
[42:13] years and years and years but he says
[42:16] you'll you'll make up that house of God
[42:18] now you partakers you'll be part of his
[42:20] house if you hold fast until the end
[42:24] come on until the end until like they
[42:26] said you give up the ghost or until God
[42:28] calls your name you know you don't know
[42:31] when God gonna going to call you a wing
[42:33] god gonna take you but nevertheless you
[42:35] holding fast you're holding it you're
[42:37] holding come on you know you say you're
[42:39] holding because sometimes you know not
[42:41] within yourself if you've been born
[42:43] again you got the desire and the will to
[42:45] please God and to serve God but you know
[42:48] to give God all that he he desires are
[42:52] all out of your life sometimes the the
[42:55] pressures of life or the the cares of
[42:58] this world will choke things out of you
[43:00] Jesus even talked about that make you
[43:02] become unfruitful so sometimes it's
[43:04] oppressed to get out and give God all
[43:07] that he wants out your life buddy so you
[43:10] said you holding fast you holding firm
[43:12] you know you have those little shakes or
[43:13] little moments but you're holding it
[43:16] you're holding fast until the what until
[43:18] the end and I want to say tonight even
[43:20] if I get ahead of myself tonight no
[43:23] matter what hold fast to the end
[43:25] you know and that's what it is the the
[43:27] very the very beginning of your
[43:30] Christian Journey got to be right
[43:32] it got to be right if the beginning
[43:34] ain't right the house gonna fall
[43:37] you know they talk about building a
[43:38] house you can't build a house from the
[43:40] top up you can't build a roof first you
[43:43] got to start at the foundation and the
[43:44] foundation got to be right
[43:46] it can't be any kind of foundation you
[43:49] know you look at uh some areas of the
[43:52] country just because of the the
[43:54] geographical place of the country
[43:56] certain uh foundations might not work or
[44:00] they have to add certain uh additives to
[44:02] the mix of the concrete or whatever like
[44:04] that you know uh I forget what they call
[44:06] accelerators and stuff and some of it
[44:08] because of just in the air they got
[44:10] certain chemicals in the air just off of
[44:12] the ocean and all these things so you
[44:15] know you might have to make a little mix
[44:16] you know a little different for this
[44:18] atmosphere versus this atmosphere but
[44:21] nevertheless you the foundation has to
[44:24] be built right
[44:26] for the atmosphere that it's going to be
[44:28] in so it's because if it isn't that
[44:30] house might be built and it might last
[44:32] 20 years and you might not see up under
[44:34] it it's already starting a road it's
[44:36] already starting to get weak you know
[44:38] and next thing you know the the
[44:40] structure just fall all apart it didn't
[44:43] just fall all apart overnight it been
[44:45] working itself away is just that the
[44:48] time came now that the right weight got
[44:50] on it or the time came now that the
[44:52] right wind blew
[44:54] and destroyed the house destroyed the
[44:56] structure come on because it all it
[44:58] being started it ain't just starting
[45:00] that's what you see even in Christian
[45:02] lives people just just throw their hands
[45:04] up walk away just it but it didn't just
[45:06] happen overnight
[45:08] it started somewhere that they lost the
[45:12] confidence they lost that that
[45:13] steadfastness they lost it
[45:16] you know or the foundation from the
[45:18] beginning wasn't built right they didn't
[45:20] stay long enough to get filled up you
[45:23] know you know and it's important to be
[45:25] filled up
[45:26] not just to be on the surface but to be
[45:28] filled up you know David I don't believe
[45:30] it was just by coincidence in the
[45:33] Scriptures it says you know he said my
[45:35] cup running over I got enough got I got
[45:38] more enough I'm filled up to the brim
[45:40] there's no more room in the cup and that
[45:43] cup run over that's because there's no
[45:44] more room in there it's filled up to the
[45:46] brim
[45:47] because you know and that's what it is I
[45:49] said God I want you to the the engulf my
[45:51] life don't let leave no room for nothing
[45:54] because you know if there's room for the
[45:56] enemy to come in he gonna find he'll
[45:57] take that little bit of area or whatever
[45:59] you give them he'll take that little bit
[46:01] and he'll come in there don't don't give
[46:03] the devil no room let God have it
[46:05] occupied a whole house let God occupy
[46:08] everything and then he'll he'll come in
[46:11] and he'll do the work y'all believe that
[46:13] tonight you know so I says though so you
[46:15] got to be it's got to be built right you
[46:16] know it's got to be built right or like
[46:18] I said the the any the wind will blow
[46:21] house fall apart it didn't just start
[46:23] and it says you look at lives and that's
[46:25] why sometimes we stir up that that old
[46:27] man that's inside you like they say
[46:28] y'all believe that tonight so we said
[46:31] holding fast like it says here holding
[46:33] fast firm I mean rejoicing of the Hope
[46:36] firm Until the End wherefore as the Holy
[46:39] Ghost says today if you would hear his
[46:42] voice hard not your hearts as in
[46:44] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[46:47] the wilderness when your father's
[46:49] tempting me prove me and saw my Works 40
[46:51] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[46:54] generation and said they do always air
[46:57] in their heart and have not known my
[47:00] ways so I swear in my wrath they shall
[47:04] not enter into my rest take heed
[47:07] Brethren blessed by lest there be in any
[47:10] of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[47:13] departing from the Living God you know
[47:15] unbelief causes you depart from life
[47:18] he says an evil heart of unbelief is I
[47:21] want you to take heed lest there be any
[47:23] in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[47:26] and departing from the Living God we
[47:29] don't want to depart from a living God
[47:30] you know people still go to church but
[47:32] they they're not they've departed from
[47:34] the Living God they've erred from the
[47:36] faith they go to church but the god they
[47:38] serve is a painted fire they partner
[47:40] departed from them but what it is like
[47:42] we're saying the other night you know
[47:44] you serve this great God this
[47:45] Supernatural God and he still has
[47:47] Miracles he still works miracles signs
[47:49] and wonders and you got to expect them
[47:51] you got to look for them you got the
[47:53] long form
[47:54] you got the and that's what it is that's
[47:56] what all of these like we say trials and
[47:59] temptations and things are about to stir
[48:01] up because sometimes I say as you know
[48:04] like like we says tonight holding fast
[48:06] to confidence I want to ask the question
[48:08] what makes a man lose confidence in God
[48:12] what makes a man lose that that
[48:14] confidence that he had
[48:16] or that confidence they started out with
[48:18] what makes a man lose it I said is it
[48:20] because that he that God has failed him
[48:23] so many times they lost confidence in
[48:26] God but God is not a man that he should
[48:29] lie
[48:30] everything that God said he'll bring it
[48:32] to pass
[48:33] and and no matter nothing nothing wants
[48:35] him to stop God from or be able to
[48:38] hinder him except for your unbelief come
[48:41] on but but when God said something you
[48:43] can rest on us to settle Thy word oh
[48:45] Lord is settle forever is settled you
[48:47] can rest on it I say what causes a man
[48:50] to lose his confidence in God is it
[48:52] because God failed I like how God told
[48:55] Joshua I won't fail you you know we
[48:57] always talk about the Forsaken part but
[48:59] I like that part I won't fail you
[49:01] nothing won't hold God up from keeping
[49:04] his promises no matter what it looks
[49:06] like nothing won't hold God up So I says
[49:08] that what causes a man to lose his
[49:10] confidence is it that God failed him so
[49:12] many times or is it sometimes that
[49:15] everything is so accessible so already
[49:17] accessible that you know he has no need
[49:21] for that desperate he has no need to get
[49:23] in desperation he has no need to really
[49:25] call on God or to be in prayer mode
[49:27] because desperation ain't there right so
[49:31] what happens is you know when that when
[49:34] that uh like we talk about those five
[49:35] senses when they lie dormant and you
[49:38] don't use them it may not been nothing
[49:39] wrong with them from the beginning but
[49:41] it's set up too long you didn't use them
[49:43] and now when you go to use them they
[49:44] don't work right
[49:45] I made an example the other day of a car
[49:47] like you set it up might sit up two
[49:49] three years out in the yard you know and
[49:52] you parked it there and it might have
[49:53] not been nothing wrong with it but after
[49:55] that long time you gonna try to crank it
[49:56] up and it ain't gonna run
[49:58] everything gonna have to be changed out
[50:00] battery motor locked up all that
[50:02] sometimes it won't even be repairable
[50:05] because it sat up so long and sometimes
[50:08] you know what's the what's the like they
[50:11] say the need to have faith when when uh
[50:14] nothing's really going on wrong Richie
[50:16] sometimes you don't never really reach
[50:18] out because you say I don't have the
[50:19] need to is what you say but not
[50:22] realizing you use Faith every day it
[50:24] took Faith to get here to church tonight
[50:26] it took faith for you to get up out the
[50:28] bed and walk to the bathroom this
[50:30] morning it took Faith you're using it
[50:32] sometimes unconsciously but to to to
[50:36] um what what God does I believe
[50:37] sometimes is he'll shake the like we
[50:40] said he put He put a stop to the show
[50:42] he'll shake things up a little bit to do
[50:44] what to get your confidence back up
[50:47] we get your your attention to get you to
[50:50] turn and begin to look to him a little
[50:52] more
[50:53] because you know the Bible says there'll
[50:55] be rich increase with goods and have
[50:57] need or what nothing they had lost they
[51:00] they don't have need or nothing but then
[51:02] God ain't gonna let you or not because
[51:03] we're his children he ain't gonna let us
[51:05] get to that point the way we have need
[51:07] or nothing he gonna let everything fail
[51:08] us
[51:09] to where we say God I know I need you I
[51:12] need all of you God I need your healing
[51:14] I need your I need your finances Lord I
[51:17] need you in every area of my life God I
[51:20] need you so he allow those things I come
[51:22] to that uh place in my life to
[51:24] understand that everything God does
[51:26] everything for a reason
[51:28] God is working on me like like I said
[51:30] I'm gonna start saying God is working on
[51:32] me pray for me God is working on me he's
[51:34] he's working something out because
[51:36] that's what he's doing it's somewhere
[51:39] along the line I wasn't looking at him
[51:41] like I used to
[51:42] so he allows something to happen the way
[51:44] I can look to him and say God I need
[51:46] your help
[51:47] I need you
[51:49] Lord I'm sorry I I I I I hear you I need
[51:54] your help I hear what you're saying God
[51:55] I need your help and that's what God
[51:57] want to get us to y'all believe that
[51:58] tonight so I said hold past the
[52:01] confidence what caused a man to lose
[52:03] that confidence and a lot of times you
[52:05] know as I said because sometimes
[52:06] everything is accessible and he has he
[52:09] has no need of that's what we say but
[52:12] not knowing that you need God every day
[52:14] it ain't a day that you wake up and you
[52:16] don't need God it ain't the day you wake
[52:18] up and you can do things on your own
[52:20] you try to convince people that it ain't
[52:22] a day you wake up and you don't need God
[52:25] it ain't one hour you can say you don't
[52:28] need them
[52:29] come on and when you when you I will say
[52:32] in the other night that uh how you know
[52:35] when a person has really went into the
[52:37] presence of God it says I said you can't
[52:40] go into the presence of God and come out
[52:41] the same it's impossible
[52:43] it's impossible for a man to really go
[52:45] into the presence of God and come back
[52:47] the same as what he was I said what it
[52:50] is his spiritual change
[52:51] you know I think about I think it was
[52:54] Isaiah said Lord he said woe is me you
[52:57] know when he got closer to that light
[52:59] didn't he because then he might have
[53:01] knew he had a little gift and all these
[53:03] things but the closer he got to that
[53:05] light he began to see how unclean he was
[53:08] and how wretched he was and how
[53:10] insufficient he was and how you know how
[53:13] great God was and how far
[53:17] fact she was but that's why that's why
[53:19] he says that when he's talking about
[53:20] righteousness he says your righteousness
[53:22] is as what filthy rags don't come to me
[53:25] saying what you've done like I owe you
[53:26] anything I don't owe you nothing I'm
[53:28] only giving it to you by my grace you
[53:30] didn't choose me but I chose you and
[53:33] that's what God sometimes have to remind
[53:35] the people of and I thank God I thank
[53:37] God because if he would have gave it up
[53:39] to us in our choice many of us wouldn't
[53:41] have chosen but when he knew he knew
[53:45] that one day we desired we would desire
[53:47] want to do right but I thank God for for
[53:49] predestination that he chose you come on
[53:52] the prophet of God in one place he said
[53:54] God he you he had you in his mind and
[53:57] when you came to a certain place into
[53:59] the world he said God recognized you he
[54:02] saw you and he recognized you because
[54:05] you were in his mind and he began to
[54:07] call in on you right because God
[54:09] recognized you and I'm so glad that God
[54:12] recognized me many times you look at
[54:15] certain uh uh uh uh things in your life
[54:17] way God brought you from and all these
[54:20] things I said but God recognized me oh I
[54:23] had something going on that I didn't
[54:25] know about myself but this was God's
[54:27] doing this ain't like said Israel doing
[54:29] but this is God's doing this is the work
[54:31] that God is doing and no man can't stop
[54:33] it and I thank God for it tonight don't
[54:35] you think ain't you thankful for that
[54:36] tonight but it says that don't lose
[54:39] don't lose that confidence hold fast
[54:40] come on hold fast there's a lot of
[54:43] things today that'll cause you to lose
[54:45] confidence ain't it or or not really
[54:47] lose confidence in God I said you can't
[54:49] lose confidence in God now no matter
[54:51] what you ever you ever been in God ever
[54:54] you ever been into that place your
[54:57] testimony is right that if God don't
[54:59] never do nothing else he already done
[55:01] enough I don't see not one more Miracle
[55:03] my testimony is sold out until the day
[55:05] that God take me away from here he
[55:07] already did enough it's he already did
[55:09] enough he already he approved himself
[55:12] like he says here in the scriptures
[55:13] don't be like them to where they proved
[55:15] me and tested me and I I did it and they
[55:18] still didn't believe me don't be like
[55:19] that but I says that God did enough
[55:22] already that no matter what comes today
[55:24] or tomorrow if I don't never hear his
[55:26] voice again I know he's out there
[55:28] somewhere
[55:29] come on he's already proved himself he's
[55:32] already proved who he was and I'm
[55:34] standing firm on that
[55:36] because God I know that your word Can't
[55:38] Fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[55:40] your word won't pass away and that's
[55:42] what I'm resting on that's what I'm
[55:44] going down in Hallelujah
[55:46] and that word inside of you like it says
[55:48] that no man can go into that presence of
[55:50] God and ever be the same he gonna come
[55:52] out in his speech gonna be different he
[55:54] ain't gonna talk about what he could do
[55:56] and what he capable of because when you
[55:58] go in that presence you know that like
[56:00] Christ said without me you can't do
[56:02] nothing
[56:03] come on the life is in the is in the
[56:07] vine and you are the branches
[56:10] the life is in you right I I always tell
[56:14] the testimony I've seen someone one time
[56:16] they look like they were asleep but they
[56:18] were dead
[56:19] and and you know nobody knew right away
[56:22] I guess but look like they just looked
[56:25] like I seen the The Life just leave out
[56:29] of them
[56:30] it looked like it looked like they just
[56:32] just the breath just left out of them
[56:34] and I say is that you know what
[56:36] that's what that's what happens but
[56:39] nevertheless we got to understand that
[56:41] that breath you taking that was God
[56:43] allows you to do that
[56:45] that you doing God did that God allowed
[56:48] on it right
[56:50] God doing it's his power hovering over
[56:52] you you know he make his Reign it rained
[56:55] on the just and unjust the unbelievers
[56:57] don't want to recognize him but he's
[56:59] still good to them too now he's long
[57:02] suffering is what he is come on that's
[57:04] what he is he long suffering but I says
[57:07] that oh our eyes has been open and we
[57:10] see God for who he is and we thankful
[57:12] that's why we praise him no man once you
[57:14] went into that presence and you come
[57:16] back no man don't have to force you to
[57:18] praise God no no man I have to tell you
[57:21] to have the the be glad when they said
[57:23] you come into the house the Lord no man
[57:25] I have to tell you that no man I have to
[57:27] tell you that that you need to put God
[57:29] first because you've been in that
[57:31] presence and you know who he is
[57:33] no man I'll tell you that you ought to
[57:36] be thankful
[57:37] to him no man will tell you that no man
[57:40] would have to tell you hey y'all you
[57:42] ought to be well I guess I no no you've
[57:44] been in that prison no man I have to
[57:45] tell you that you'll come back a change
[57:48] individual you'll come back thanking God
[57:50] for another day come back thanking God
[57:52] for his glory and his grace that you
[57:54] couldn't obtain it but Christ has
[57:56] obtained it for us
[57:59] and by him obtaining it he come down and
[58:01] freely give it to us
[58:03] Hallelujah you ain't worth it but God
[58:06] went the distance came down off his
[58:09] throne born in a manger to live in this
[58:13] crooked world that came to it didn't
[58:16] even want him rejected him sometimes you
[58:18] think about oh the world don't like you
[58:20] look what they did to Jesus
[58:22] look what they did to him but yet he
[58:25] endured all that didn't he the Bible
[58:27] says he was despised and rejected of men
[58:29] a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[58:32] that great God that created all these
[58:34] things that great God hallelujah
[58:38] that you know some men build houses but
[58:41] all things are built by God that great
[58:42] God come on came down and got in a body
[58:46] didn't he because he was once God above
[58:49] us but he wanted to be tangible
[58:52] he wanted to be Emmanuel God With Us
[58:56] I want to be touched by what they're
[58:58] going through
[59:00] I want to feel the pain they feel I want
[59:03] to feel the rejection and the hurt
[59:06] so when they come to me I could say I
[59:08] know what you're going through
[59:10] I've been through it press you can make
[59:13] it
[59:14] he was the first fruit wasn't he he went
[59:16] the distance to show you
[59:19] Hallelujah he left no stone unturned he
[59:22] defeated the enemy he said he rose with
[59:25] all power didn't he and that's what it
[59:28] is God's got all power so when the enemy
[59:31] comes remember he's a Bluff trying to
[59:34] get you off that stand of Faith because
[59:36] he don't have no power wolfing talking
[59:39] in your ear Christ has got all the power
[59:41] devil he don't whip you his blood was
[59:45] shed and his power in his blood come on
[59:48] he rose with the keys not only did he
[59:51] defeat uh everything in this life for us
[59:54] but he defeated death
[59:57] doubt was your enemy but he defeated
[59:59] death for you that even when you go down
[1:00:01] you don't have to be afraid to die
[1:00:04] but you can be like Paul and said oh uh
[1:00:07] oh death whereas I sting oh grave where
[1:00:09] is thy victory it ain't me but if that
[1:00:13] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:00:15] dead
[1:00:16] if it dwells in you
[1:00:18] come on not what church you go to family
[1:00:20] all those things but the Holy Ghost if
[1:00:23] it dwells in you that's the life this
[1:00:26] body might be dead but life is still in
[1:00:28] you
[1:00:29] Hallelujah one day he called your name
[1:00:32] and that life comes about something
[1:00:34] quick in you and you come back I believe
[1:00:36] that oh I believe that with all of my
[1:00:39] heart come on God is so good come on a
[1:00:42] lot of people don't believe that you
[1:00:44] know that
[1:00:45] a lot of people sit in church and don't
[1:00:46] believe that you know they'll do it amen
[1:00:50] it all that but in their heart they
[1:00:52] don't believe it because how can you
[1:00:53] believe in the resurrection from the
[1:00:55] dead but don't believe in Divine Healing
[1:00:57] can't believe in that without one not
[1:01:00] believing out any other right come on
[1:01:02] but nevertheless God is changing us from
[1:01:05] glory to glory he allows us to go
[1:01:07] through these things that's why I said
[1:01:08] God is working things out he let them go
[1:01:10] in the wilderness he let them go in
[1:01:12] there and knew where he was leading them
[1:01:14] that it wasn't going to be no water God
[1:01:16] knew that didn't he
[1:01:18] but he also knew that he could give them
[1:01:20] water in those places
[1:01:22] come on ask God God I want water he
[1:01:25] already know I'm leading you the way I'm
[1:01:26] leaving you ain't got no water he know
[1:01:28] that
[1:01:29] but he also knew that he was a Creator
[1:01:31] some men build houses but the one that
[1:01:34] built everything is God he knowed that
[1:01:36] didn't he
[1:01:37] so but he led them by that way anyway
[1:01:39] and give him water give him bread give
[1:01:41] me whatever you want I want to show you
[1:01:43] that the land might look Barren but I'm
[1:01:47] God
[1:01:48] Almighty I remember when Abraham in the
[1:01:51] scriptures were so old and God began to
[1:01:54] tell him he says he says I'm God come on
[1:01:57] he says a walk before me and be thou
[1:01:59] perfect
[1:02:00] and he began to tell them is there
[1:02:02] anything too hard for the Lord come on
[1:02:04] I'm Mighty God I'm almighty God you just
[1:02:06] walk before me and be perfect I want to
[1:02:09] show you that those things that's dead
[1:02:10] I'll bring them back to life again
[1:02:13] and I know he can
[1:02:15] I seen him do it
[1:02:16] and that's showing he's the same
[1:02:18] yesterday today and forever yes he is
[1:02:22] God is he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:25] forever
[1:02:26] he said I am he that wish was and and it
[1:02:29] was not and it is to come I am him come
[1:02:31] on the Alfred Omega the beginning and
[1:02:34] the ending come on I didn't change
[1:02:37] nothing for my statue I am that I am
[1:02:39] call on me I didn't change
[1:02:42] time has changed but I never changed I'm
[1:02:45] still that God Almighty and I believe it
[1:02:48] he's showing it to us ain't it he proven
[1:02:51] it to us all the time
[1:02:53] Hallelujah but like it says you can't go
[1:02:55] in that presence think about that a man
[1:02:57] can't go on that President come back and
[1:02:59] be the same it's impossible
[1:03:01] for a man to do that but we find here it
[1:03:04] says
[1:03:05] harder not your hearts in the averse as
[1:03:07] in the day in the provocation in the day
[1:03:10] of Temptation in the wilderness when
[1:03:12] your father's tempted me improved me and
[1:03:14] saw my words 40 years where I was agreed
[1:03:16] with that generation let's drop down to
[1:03:18] the fifth verse it says while it is said
[1:03:20] today if ye will hear his voice hard not
[1:03:24] your hearts as in propagation he says
[1:03:27] today if you will hear his voice there's
[1:03:28] a lot of voices out there
[1:03:30] there's a lot of them out there but if
[1:03:32] you'll hear his voice today some you got
[1:03:35] to hear his voice through all the noise
[1:03:36] through all of the crowd through all of
[1:03:39] the confusion you got to still be able
[1:03:40] to hear God's voice
[1:03:42] it tried all this stuff tries to drown
[1:03:45] out God's voice but God's voice is still
[1:03:47] out there and it's still calling that's
[1:03:49] why he says that he that hath an ear let
[1:03:52] him hear
[1:03:52] come on because his voice is still out
[1:03:55] there
[1:03:56] the noise is trying to drown it out the
[1:03:58] things are trying to drown it out like
[1:03:59] it says a lot of times when something is
[1:04:01] really going on they'll create a
[1:04:03] diversion on the media and I believe
[1:04:05] that to try to drown out what take you
[1:04:08] away from what's really taking place
[1:04:10] you know you'll have some major things
[1:04:13] going on but then they'll have something
[1:04:14] on on the news about some some marriages
[1:04:18] broke up or or something like that or
[1:04:20] some football players gambling maybe
[1:04:23] they'll they'll have something like that
[1:04:24] when major things are taking place
[1:04:27] and then they'll have to do what to tune
[1:04:29] you away from the signs of the times but
[1:04:32] nevertheless you and I got ears to hear
[1:04:35] we got eyes to see we can't be divert
[1:04:38] nothing don't divert Us in tune we can't
[1:04:40] be tuned away because our tune is just
[1:04:43] like Elisha when he was following Elijah
[1:04:45] they said you know your master getting
[1:04:47] taken away today he said I know but hold
[1:04:49] your peace come on everywhere he went
[1:04:52] tried to get distracted but he said no
[1:04:54] hold your peace come on because it was
[1:04:57] things were trying to distract them I
[1:04:59] believe that even when Elijah says well
[1:05:01] if you see me when I go you know like we
[1:05:03] said I would have been afraid to Blink
[1:05:05] that's how in tune you had to be because
[1:05:08] if I didn't see him when he go I'm going
[1:05:10] to miss something great
[1:05:12] I'm gonna miss that double portion I'm
[1:05:14] gonna miss that power imma miss the
[1:05:17] thing that I've been following them for
[1:05:18] long and for imagining Elijah Alicia
[1:05:21] would have been following him all that
[1:05:22] time and then got there to a place to
[1:05:24] where he says okay well I'll just quit
[1:05:26] now you followed him all that time but
[1:05:28] you didn't endure to the end you didn't
[1:05:30] hold fast your confidence to the end so
[1:05:32] you missed it come on but he held to the
[1:05:35] end didn't he and then when he caught
[1:05:37] that mantle Hallelujah did he realize
[1:05:40] yes Elijah has gone up but the god of
[1:05:42] Elijah is still here he's still here to
[1:05:45] do the same things come on
[1:05:47] and we got confidence in him the man is
[1:05:50] gone but God is still here come on and I
[1:05:53] got confidence in him he's still doing
[1:05:55] the same things
[1:05:57] Hallelujah I believe it with all of my
[1:06:00] heart
[1:06:00] what he says here in the in the 16th
[1:06:03] verse for some when they heard did
[1:06:05] provoke how be it not all came out of
[1:06:08] Egypt by Moses but with whom was he
[1:06:10] grieved 40 years was it not with them
[1:06:13] that had sinned whose carcass fell in
[1:06:15] the wilderness and to whom swear he that
[1:06:19] they should not enter into his rest but
[1:06:22] to them that believe not
[1:06:24] so we see that they could not enter in
[1:06:28] because of what unbelief now we know
[1:06:31] they did a lot of things right he said
[1:06:34] but they couldn't enter in because of
[1:06:35] unbelief
[1:06:37] right
[1:06:38] he said the the unbelief the sin of
[1:06:40] unbelief all the things he says we see
[1:06:43] that the reason why they couldn't enter
[1:06:45] in was because of unbelief
[1:06:47] they doubt it you know I often
[1:06:50] said and we always say saving that
[1:06:53] looking at this this message here says
[1:06:55] that you know how could they see it and
[1:06:57] not believe how can they see all the
[1:06:59] things they saw and then the end of the
[1:07:01] story like was saying the other other
[1:07:03] day how can they see and and all these
[1:07:06] things and then at the end of the story
[1:07:08] it'd be that they didn't go in because
[1:07:11] of unbelief
[1:07:12] how can they see it all the Miracles the
[1:07:16] signs and the Wonders and they perish
[1:07:18] because they they didn't believe how
[1:07:21] how could that be possible
[1:07:24] but you know I say even when they got to
[1:07:27] the land and they come back it's just
[1:07:29] like God said it was
[1:07:31] come on God just as he described it the
[1:07:34] land is just like he said it was but yet
[1:07:38] we can't go over I can see Joshua and
[1:07:40] Caleb you know trying to encourage them
[1:07:43] brothers like I was saying the other day
[1:07:45] don't go back into that camp and sow
[1:07:47] that Discord of unbelief
[1:07:49] you know the devil do that get amongst
[1:07:51] the people and saw a Discord of unbelief
[1:07:54] when the ministry or the whatever the
[1:07:55] word can come and have the people on
[1:07:58] such a high faith of anointing right
[1:08:01] and the where things are beginning to
[1:08:04] break Deliverance is getting ready to
[1:08:06] come but here come the the enticing
[1:08:09] Spirit a lion Spirit unbelief come to
[1:08:13] say yeah but you know and to get the
[1:08:16] people to doubt it and then you miss
[1:08:18] your blessing come on but I could see
[1:08:20] Joshua and Caleb say to them brothers
[1:08:23] just dramatizing it don't show that in
[1:08:26] the monster people don't go back and
[1:08:28] tell the people those things we saw them
[1:08:30] yes but just tell the people that the
[1:08:32] land is just like God is God said it
[1:08:35] would be don't sow that amongst the
[1:08:37] people and look what they did look what
[1:08:39] that that seed of of of
[1:08:42] Doubt look what it did
[1:08:44] it calls them the Bible said they weeped
[1:08:46] all night you brought us out here to die
[1:08:48] we should have left stayed in Egypt but
[1:08:50] then Joshua and Caleb said no come on
[1:08:53] see they had to steal the people God has
[1:08:56] done too much for us already
[1:08:58] God has brought us too far don't you
[1:09:01] know we were in bondage don't you know
[1:09:03] where God brought us from let's have
[1:09:05] testimony service for a while before you
[1:09:07] begin to doubt let's testify what God
[1:09:09] brought us from let's let me tell you
[1:09:12] wait God where we were and look what all
[1:09:14] let's let's have testimony service
[1:09:16] before you go back down and before you
[1:09:18] disbelieve God think about what God has
[1:09:21] already done
[1:09:22] Hallelujah
[1:09:25] don't look at what the opposition in
[1:09:27] front of you look at what God has
[1:09:29] already done
[1:09:30] you know I believe it was David and
[1:09:32] everybody was afraid he said you can't
[1:09:34] fight them he a man of war since it's
[1:09:37] you David says well I fought that lion
[1:09:39] and God delivered me and I was a little
[1:09:42] I was a little younger then
[1:09:44] maybe a little less weight then
[1:09:48] and I and and the bear came
[1:09:50] and God delivered them in my hands I
[1:09:52] should have died back then
[1:09:55] when the lion came I should have died
[1:09:57] when the bear came oh I should have ran
[1:10:00] and let them have the Sheep
[1:10:01] but something inside of me said that you
[1:10:05] know like my father gave me charge over
[1:10:06] these sheep I might have 99 more but I
[1:10:09] ain't gonna let him get that one I'm
[1:10:11] going after them Hallelujah if I die
[1:10:14] trying to save that sheep let me die but
