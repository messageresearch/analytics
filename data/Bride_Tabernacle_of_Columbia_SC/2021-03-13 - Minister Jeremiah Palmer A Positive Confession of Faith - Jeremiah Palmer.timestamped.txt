[30:51] my family do send their regards again to
[30:54] you and thank you for everything amen in
[30:56] jesus christ's name
[30:59] tonight the book of romans the fourth
[31:02] chapter
[31:05] let's start at the 13th verse
[31:10] and to the 21st
[31:15] romans 4 and 13.
[31:18] for the promise that he should be the
[31:22] heir of the world
[31:24] was not to abraham or to his seed
[31:28] through the law but through the
[31:30] righteousness of
[31:32] faith for if they which are of the law
[31:36] be heirs faith is made void
[31:40] and the promise made of non-effect
[31:44] because the law worketh wrath
[31:47] where no law is there is no
[31:49] transgression
[31:51] therefore it is of faith that it might
[31:54] be by
[31:55] grace to the end the promise
[31:59] might be sure to all the seed
[32:03] not to that only which is of the law but
[32:06] to that
[32:06] also which is of the faith of abraham
[32:10] who is the father of us all as
[32:13] it is written i had made thee a father
[32:16] of many nation
[32:17] before him whom he believed even god
[32:21] who quickened the dead and calleth those
[32:24] thing which be not as though they were
[32:28] who against hope believe in hope
[32:32] that he might become the father of many
[32:34] nations
[32:35] according to that which was spoken so
[32:38] shall thy seed be
[32:40] and being not weak in faith he
[32:44] considered
[32:45] not his own body now dead
[32:48] wherein he was about 100 years old
[32:51] neither yet the deadness of sarah roon
[32:54] he staggered not at the promise of god
[32:57] through unbelief
[32:58] but was strong in faith giving
[33:01] glory to god and being
[33:04] fully persuaded that what he had
[33:07] promised
[33:08] he was able also to perform
[33:12] let us pray father we thank you god for
[33:15] the reading of your word
[33:17] and we pray that you quicken it lord
[33:19] sanctified it'll be nurtured into our
[33:21] body
[33:22] in jesus name amen may be seated
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] i want to use for a little thought
[33:38] tonight a positive confession of faith
[33:43] a positive confession
[33:47] of faith
[33:51] and when we look at the word
[33:54] positive it means fully assured
[33:58] or confident that something will be
[34:02] or will happen
[34:05] but it got to be a positive confession
[34:10] we all time like to say that uh
[34:13] you know we don't really realize it i
[34:16] believe
[34:16] to the fullness that
[34:20] what you say out of your mouth has power
[34:23] in it
[34:26] one person life in depth is in the power
[34:29] of the tongue
[34:32] but the call gave us a book being said
[34:34] hung by the tongue
[34:38] and i believe as you know as uh
[34:41] you know being in the body that and how
[34:45] we were born that
[34:46] is simply to be such
[34:50] um easy thing to always dwell on the
[34:54] negative
[34:59] because a lot of times we weren't taught
[35:01] certain principles
[35:04] we weren't taught that be careful what
[35:07] you say
[35:07] or you might have it
[35:12] and being in sin but i believe that's
[35:15] why it's so important that when we
[35:18] become a new creature we
[35:20] have been born of the spirit of god
[35:24] then we want to try to develop
[35:29] the characteristic that god has
[35:32] and that's positive
[35:36] amen in other words we now are in
[35:39] training
[35:41] to train ourselves and sometimes we get
[35:44] a little you know
[35:45] carried away but you have to put
[35:47] yourself back in check
[35:52] and understand that i can't be saying
[35:55] anything out of my mouth i can't do well
[35:58] on how i feel
[36:00] or what's going on with me i got to look
[36:03] at the greater picture
[36:05] and say lord thank you for everything
[36:11] i'm learning saying that somebody's
[36:15] singing and learning how to lean
[36:18] it depends on jesus
[36:21] but i understand that we always know and
[36:25] quote that uh the greatest
[36:28] battle we have with this is being able
[36:31] to
[36:31] uh confess positive is because
[36:35] the mind-setting
[36:40] and i'm learning that i don't mind is a
[36:42] devil workshop
[36:47] where we struggle the most and don't
[36:50] really
[36:50] understand that when you let your mind
[36:53] just
[36:54] run away with things
[36:57] but understanding that no no no i can't
[37:00] allow that
[37:02] you can't just allow your mind as one
[37:05] person
[37:05] said you know you can't stop the thought
[37:07] from coming but you don't have to let
[37:09] them build a nest there
[37:14] when they do come and i'm going to read
[37:16] something on that but
[37:17] i i'll merely uh want to you know
[37:21] and i and i'm learning myself you know
[37:23] they say you're never
[37:24] uh too old to learn and we are learning
[37:28] god is training us
[37:31] the word that he gave us is teaching us
[37:35] uh to change our tone of speech
[37:40] you know that we want to inject but be
[37:43] sure that what you injecting is
[37:46] is something that's gonna help somebody
[37:48] you know and not because
[37:51] i i found that when a person is already
[37:54] down
[37:55] the worst thing you can do is to try to
[37:57] add
[38:00] he needs to be lifted up
[38:03] i believe that's what god wanted he want
[38:05] to lift us
[38:06] up we we're dwelling in a country and
[38:10] especially now with all negative on
[38:14] everywhere
[38:16] the radio negative the tv negative
[38:19] facebook negative youtube negative
[38:22] hospital job church and where you going
[38:26] the grocery store
[38:27] this negative but let's let's turn it
[38:31] turn this thing inside yes it but god is
[38:35] in control of it
[38:41] because if we don't we become
[38:44] victims of things that we
[38:48] really don't want
[38:51] here i'm looking uh
[38:54] at abraham and you know
[38:58] when god made this promise to abraham
[39:04] it was nothing that abraham had to do
[39:10] because it was under unconditional
[39:15] god said it
[39:20] from the beginning and we understand
[39:23] that
[39:23] um if it was something that you know how
[39:26] we make
[39:26] promises that we can't hardly keep
[39:30] you know but god is not like that
[39:33] when god ever promised something
[39:37] he can and will perform it but it
[39:42] depends on the people that
[39:44] receive that
[39:48] you don't want to say one place that
[39:50] faith come by
[39:51] hearing and
[39:54] hearing the word
[39:58] but that word just a letter
[40:02] but that word we don't have to say that
[40:04] faith
[40:05] is a revelation it's
[40:09] a substance of things
[40:12] hoped for not the evidence of things not
[40:15] seen or seen what you see is not
[40:19] faith so
[40:22] faith has to be something that god
[40:25] reveals to you
[40:28] as an individual
[40:31] and i believe as you need uh
[40:34] to know that uh when special when you
[40:37] are sick
[40:40] you know we have so much promises on
[40:42] that
[40:43] but one isaiah killed it all
[40:48] by his stripes we are healed
[40:52] now healing your healing don't dwell on
[40:55] how you feel
[40:58] it doesn't matter what kind of report
[41:01] you might even get from going to the
[41:03] doctors
[41:05] but faith looks beyond reports
[41:11] faith looks at god
[41:14] in god there isn't never will be any
[41:18] failure
[41:20] he has never said anything that
[41:23] he cannot perform
[41:27] i like it one place when he's saying
[41:29] how's that it says that
[41:31] my word has gone out of my mouth
[41:35] and it shall not
[41:38] return unto me void
[41:42] but a positive confession
[41:47] when you see things that may be going in
[41:51] a
[41:51] different direction
[41:55] in our lives
[42:00] how you perceive it
[42:03] how you look at that it's going to
[42:05] determine
[42:07] what kind of results you're going to get
[42:12] we have in this day so much
[42:15] there's been bombarding that has been
[42:18] told
[42:18] us and this and that and this and that
[42:22] and just listening to it it'll make you
[42:24] feel bad
[42:27] but you can't just sit in that kind of
[42:30] uh
[42:30] atmosphere you got to create a
[42:33] positive atmosphere
[42:37] there is god table and please say that
[42:39] you are more than able
[42:43] why because i made the way already for
[42:46] you
[42:47] you don't have to worry you don't have
[42:50] to feel
[42:51] he said feel not little flock
[42:56] you know one day i i know that this word
[43:01] has got to come to a reality that
[43:04] there's gonna be a people that's gonna
[43:07] not just
[43:08] take it as information spoken but it's
[43:11] gonna be a revelation that they know
[43:14] that
[43:14] this is what god promised me
[43:18] now every promise in the book
[43:22] is yours
[43:26] but it depends on how you are taking it
[43:32] all by to say all these precious
[43:34] promises
[43:36] that god has given to us
[43:40] and sometimes we just sit and look at
[43:42] them
[43:43] i wonder you know
[43:46] what i need to do
[43:50] sir god say one place here he said now
[43:53] faith is the only direct
[43:57] of sense
[44:00] he said faith is more than sight
[44:06] but it's a supernatural sixth sense he
[44:09] called it
[44:11] it looked beyond the conditions
[44:16] it looked beyond symptoms
[44:20] it looked beyond what's going on and
[44:23] is seen positive
[44:28] it's seen victory
[44:32] it sees overcoming power
[44:37] in spite of what's going on in the world
[44:40] i'm not going to let the devil steal my
[44:42] joy
[44:45] oh that you're going through it oh
[44:47] that's what's going on
[44:49] i still got joy
[44:52] regardless of what they are talking
[44:57] we're not listening to that we're
[44:59] listening to
[45:00] another voice
[45:04] oh my i wonder how we heard that voice
[45:08] lately
[45:11] let me tell you something you sit there
[45:13] and listen to them other voices
[45:16] uh just it's sadly
[45:19] but he said faith is direct
[45:22] it don't dwell on how you feel
[45:26] it don't dwell on how it looks
[45:30] not i would tell us why i said a you may
[45:33] be
[45:33] seeing it just right with your natural
[45:36] eye
[45:37] what you saying is it's nothing but the
[45:40] truth but
[45:41] you looking beyond
[45:44] what these eyes see see but you're
[45:48] looking in the
[45:49] eyes of a spiritual being
[45:52] and that's why the son of god he said
[45:54] revelation to
[45:56] a true believer means more to you than
[45:59] what you
[46:00] think he said not just the book of
[46:04] revelation
[46:05] but all revelation
[46:10] so god said if you begin to confess
[46:14] you were not saved he said then
[46:18] you are not saved and then your life
[46:21] gonna exemplify
[46:23] what you say that's why working with the
[46:27] people
[46:28] in maryland i'm telling them you know
[46:29] about the holy ghost
[46:31] i say when you understand that it's a
[46:34] promise that
[46:35] god gave to you then you can
[46:39] claim that
[46:42] you can you ain't just claiming
[46:44] something you know that no no
[46:46] it's your problem because he said to you
[46:49] and to your children and many that are
[46:51] far off
[46:52] it's given to you after you repent
[46:57] be baptized in the name of lord jesus
[46:59] christ for the remission of your sin
[47:02] ye shall receive the holy ghost
[47:09] confess it if you did the requirement
[47:13] you can say lord
[47:14] according to your word and all that i
[47:17] know to do lord
[47:18] i did what you told me father god now
[47:22] lord let your word be made manifested in
[47:25] my life
[47:27] in other words be it unto me
[47:30] oh i imagine how mary said that thing
[47:34] you know when it came to her she said be
[47:37] it unto
[47:38] me according to your word
[47:45] and she brought forth
[47:49] but a positive confession
[47:53] we understand that you can create a
[47:56] certain atmosphere with your confession
[48:01] something always wrong nothing nothing
[48:04] never right
[48:06] if the sun don't come out i wonder why
[48:09] if it rains why it raining so much when
[48:12] it stops
[48:13] i wonder when it gonna rain again
[48:16] it just we do that
[48:20] because we fail to understand that you
[48:22] know
[48:23] whatever one player said whatever state
[48:26] you
[48:27] find yourself in be content
[48:32] but now if it's a negative state you got
[48:35] to come out of that
[48:38] don't stay there and just drown in
[48:41] drowsiness
[48:43] you know this drowsy drowsy drowsy no
[48:47] no you have to change the way you
[48:50] speaking you have to reverse that
[48:54] thing and you're the only one that can
[48:58] do it
[49:00] the pastor can't no preacher can
[49:03] it's you and god
[49:06] is is training us to understand now let
[49:10] me let me tell you something
[49:11] he said now nothing can happen to you
[49:14] unless i allow it
[49:17] and if i allow that to happen i got a
[49:20] purpose
[49:21] so everything that happened to your life
[49:24] god got a purpose and if it's god's
[49:28] purpose
[49:29] the lord thank you i may not understand
[49:33] it
[49:33] but thank you anyhow i may
[49:37] don't see why but lord i know it's
[49:40] working
[49:41] for my good everything
[49:44] god allowed to happen is working for
[49:46] your good
[49:50] yes tragedy working for your good
[49:55] and that's what god is wants to do he he
[49:58] he wants to
[49:59] purging us he want got to get all the
[50:01] drugs and
[50:02] all of this uh worldliness of
[50:06] how we you know some people you say well
[50:08] why are you he said well i always been
[50:10] like that and my mama was that daddy and
[50:13] so i'm always that kind of
[50:15] person but is that the kind of person
[50:17] god
[50:19] wants you to be because all of us
[50:22] inherit things down through those genes
[50:25] but there's some things you got to
[50:27] understand that no no no i don't need
[50:28] that
[50:30] you know and you got to understand that
[50:32] to cut that thing off
[50:35] under the blood cut it off if it's not
[50:38] profitable if it's not like god cut it
[50:41] off
[50:43] you got the war against that thing if
[50:45] you got issues in your life that you
[50:47] talk a lot and
[50:48] you get high tempered you got to pray on
[50:51] that thing
[50:53] lord break it i want your spirit i want
[50:57] your character i want to be more like
[51:00] jesus
[51:02] more and more and more and more
[51:05] i want to be like him
[51:09] i can't be like the promise
[51:12] no no no no no i understand
[51:16] when you understand the family you
[51:18] understand
[51:19] the good there is good and there is bad
[51:21] but i want to dwell on the good
[51:22] the bad i i don't need that
[51:26] you know because it's not going to
[51:27] profit me see
[51:29] we all want uh uh to be possible
[51:36] we want to learn that how i can walk in
[51:39] victory how i can walk into humbleness
[51:43] and in the spirit of god and that takes
[51:46] prayer prayer the only thing can break
[51:50] it
[51:52] we've got to uh uh make ourselves
[51:56] fight our way and get somewhere
[52:00] along with god amen that's the only way
[52:05] i say prayer is the most powerful
[52:09] weapon that we ever have
[52:12] not really not singing not
[52:15] preaching but praying
[52:20] pray always without ceasing
[52:23] praying in the morning praying at noon
[52:26] praying at night pray when you don't
[52:29] feel like it that's the best time to
[52:32] pray
[52:35] that's the hardest thing christians
[52:39] most don't have no problem with anything
[52:41] else
[52:42] but when they come prayer
[52:46] lord have mercy and the devil know it
[52:50] as long as he keep you can talk so god
[52:53] says we can talk too much
[52:56] we can we can sing too much and we can
[52:59] preach
[53:00] too much but you never
[53:03] can pray too much i remember the time
[53:07] that
[53:08] uh brother sibling was involved in in
[53:10] the time that you know
[53:12] you should do whatever so often you know
[53:14] we sing sing
[53:15] sing and one time every time that he
[53:18] shut it down no more singing 30 days
[53:23] we're gonna just pray i'm gonna come out
[53:26] and preach no singing any comment no
[53:30] song service
[53:33] just praying and then the word
[53:37] but let me tell you something something
[53:40] happened
[53:42] it calls us when we did went back to
[53:44] saying
[53:45] it gave us something to sing about
[53:49] because something had developed and i
[53:52] understand now that he was trying to
[53:55] get the people to a mold that let's pray
[53:58] more than anything you know if we can
[54:02] pray more everything else will work out
[54:06] but prayer breaks you into a mode
[54:10] you know of you calling on god and
[54:13] laying your petition
[54:14] and and not looking wrong with everybody
[54:17] else doing god going
[54:18] but lord it's me
[54:21] that's where the trouble at lord
[54:24] it's not my wife or my husband or
[54:27] children lord
[54:28] but it probably is with me
[54:32] and we know that we are the worst enemy
[54:36] there is no other enemy you got but you
[54:40] and i was telling me man i said we
[54:42] stopped worrying about
[54:43] this and that focus on you
[54:47] and if you can put all the time on
[54:50] you and not look what anybody else is
[54:53] doing and the faults
[54:54] you'll find out lord i got more faults
[54:56] than they do
[54:59] and i realize that i i don't have time
[55:01] to
[55:02] you know to look and and talk no no no
[55:04] lord
[55:05] i got issues lord
[55:08] crucified his flesh lord
[55:12] fill me with love because
[55:15] love covers a multitude
[55:20] and i believe that's what we are right
[55:21] kid when it's the
[55:23] rich gender my love of god we don't see
[55:26] faults because all of us got that
[55:30] but we understand love will cover
[55:35] we pray one for another we
[55:38] pray lord bless my sister bless
[55:42] my brother lord bring him out of that
[55:44] situation
[55:46] that's what love does but if there ain't
[55:49] no love there
[55:52] we help kill them
[55:55] then we want to i wonder what happened
[55:59] not love well it displayed i'm
[56:03] gonna go to one place talking about
[56:07] positive the book of numbers
[56:10] and i made this paraphrase most of it
[56:19] but i thought about this
[56:24] in dealing with the numbers of these 20
[56:30] 23.
[56:34] if that's what i want i'm not sure yet
[56:41] well that's one the story though
[56:45] it says the numbers are 23 and 19
[56:49] it said god is not a man that he should
[56:53] lie
[56:54] neither the son of man that he should
[56:56] repent
[56:58] have he said and shall he not do it or
[57:01] has he spoken
[57:03] and shall he not make it good
[57:06] see god is able to make
[57:10] every promise good
[57:13] what i was thinking about the story i'm
[57:15] not going to
[57:16] go to it but to see numbers also dealing
[57:19] with you know
[57:20] the 10 spies that god
[57:23] told moses sent them out to he gave them
[57:26] a land
[57:27] and he multiples that get 10 spies and
[57:31] let them go and spot some moses
[57:33] uh you know had 10 spies that went out
[57:35] and
[57:36] and talking about the land and how good
[57:38] it is and who all was in the land and
[57:41] how
[57:41] good the land was and these spies went
[57:45] out
[57:46] you know to see and then they all had to
[57:49] bring back
[57:51] a report and we know the story that
[57:55] how that eight of them brought back a
[57:57] year report
[57:59] but why they were looking at
[58:03] what was in the lane they would not
[58:07] considering that god said it's
[58:10] ours but joshua
[58:14] and caleb said they had another spirit
[58:18] they wasn't looking at the giants they
[58:20] were looking at
[58:22] all those walls and yes the people were
[58:25] big but
[58:26] to joshua and caleb that's nothing
[58:28] because god
[58:29] said it's ours so i mean when they
[58:33] brought that
[58:33] report to moses are more than this until
[58:36] men
[58:36] and the bible said when they got that
[58:38] evil report they said the people
[58:41] feared came over the whole congregation
[58:47] but then joshua and caleb said wait a
[58:49] minute
[58:51] they had to try to quiet the people down
[58:53] and say
[58:54] wait a minute god
[58:57] said the land was ours
[59:02] it didn't matter who was there
[59:05] it didn't matter what was there only
[59:08] one thing they knew god said so
[59:14] they were positive in the midst of the
[59:17] giants you have to be positive
[59:21] in the midst of your giant
[59:24] [Music]
[59:25] yes giants will come but like like
[59:29] like david i like that davis david told
[59:31] that philistine
[59:33] yeah you come boasting me with a sword
[59:35] and all but i'll come to you in the name
[59:37] of the lord
[59:38] i'm gonna take your head off
[59:41] yeah david was no match
[59:46] you will know back for the devil
[59:49] no we can't not in ourselves but the
[59:52] bible said
[59:53] greater greater
[59:57] is he that is in
[1:00:00] who you
[1:00:04] you greater is he
[1:00:08] and that greater that is in you is able
[1:00:12] to take everything
[1:00:15] through christ that's why we don't rely
[1:00:19] upon ourselves
[1:00:20] that's why we don't look to any of our
[1:00:23] uh kind of
[1:00:24] how strong or smart we can be come on
[1:00:27] the devil are tell us apart
[1:00:31] but we understand this as long as i
[1:00:35] stay with king jesus
[1:00:38] as long as you stay fortified
[1:00:42] behind the word you can't lose
[1:00:47] how can you
[1:00:50] he's the greatest of battle axe i know
[1:00:54] of
[1:00:55] there has never been one time he ever
[1:00:59] lost the battle
