amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of isaiah by the grace of god won't be before you long isaiah 55 very familiar scripture amen tonight i want to start on a little topic i entitled it value amen value isaiah 55 and 1. if you got it say amen and it reads ho everyone that thirst has come ye to the waters and he that have no money come by come here by and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money without price you may be seated tonight although saying sunday he said come on are you calling for all the broke people amen i said i'm in that number you look at the price of things today we broke i was telling brother jeremiah yesterday uh uh how i think it was yesterday or day before the price of stuff is just outrageous hey that stuff the part costs five dollars say it cost 21 no that's quadruple what the what the price that was just last year 21 dollars now so we're looking at what are we looking at inflation but i'm so glad tonight that god ain't concerned about your money he said i want you to come and buy he says oh you that don't have no money come on i said who ain't got no money tonight he asking you to come amen he says wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfies not we're talking about value tonight he says you're laboring for stuff that ain't satisfied why you say it ain't satisfying because tomorrow you're gonna have to get more ain't it you're gonna have to get more the next day so he says you're doing all that for stuff that ain't satisfying but he said you come to me all of you that's broke they don't have no money come on and i'm gonna give you a i'm gonna give you a satisfying portion that you don't have to come back and ask for no more how many want that tonight i don't know about you but i'm glad tonight that i could say i found that satisfying portion you know what alcohol couldn't do what drugs couldn't do come on what women or men you say can't do god could do those things how many believe that god gives you that satisfying portion that's what it is you know it's a lot of people today they go to church but they ain't satisfied they still got voids that they got to use everything else to feel those voids because they hadn't found that satisfying portion but i think about that woman at the well she was going to the well but yet she was looking for a satisfied portion was she because she says that we know that when the messiah come he'll tell us these things so she was already testifying that she was looking for him wasn't she but she hadn't found them yet but when she found that satisfying portion that's what she was looking for and i say that today a lot of people come to church and they empty come on they empty they ain't satisfied yet and that's why they're miserable that's why you know like the song says i don't know what you came to do that's why they they can't praise god they can't enter in why because they ain't found that but once you found that satisfying portion i don't care if you're tired if you're weak headache come on i was telling them the the day i worked till 8 30 last night and got out six o'clock today but i'm still running for jesus come on why because he is my satisfying portion i love the presence of god i don't know about you but it's something about when the presence of god swoop down on you you're supposed to be tired and laid out knocked out but the presence of god give you energy like you ain't never had before how many believe that come on so i said that that's what it is you know i was i was laying on the couch the other day and and the lord began speaking to me in my spirit he began to say i knew you come on he says before you was born i knew you i knew you then he started letting me see all of my life flash before me and all of my ways but then i hear hear i can hear them say to my spirit but i knew you and i knew that one day i would call you and you would answer he said i knew i already knew you i began to raise my hands and say god i thank you i ain't even thought about you but lord you knew me for i when i didn't know you god said i knew you and i knew who you were i knew your name i don't care how much the devil had you bound and sin and chains come on but when you predestinated of god god said i knew you come on and i i don't matter the devil the accuser was accusing you but i knew who you was and i knew that one day when i called you you was gonna answer the call you was gonna let go of everything else that that had value or you thought you had value in your life because when i called you i knew you hallelujah oh jesus something began ringing out of my spirit i said god thank you for knowing me thank you hallelujah for counting me valuable how many believe that tonight oh jesus i said value i'm gonna get all over myself i say you know you valuable to god tonight i don't care what the devil's saying about you you valuable to god come on you you mean so much to god you let me tell you how much how much you worth to god use words so much that he was willing to shed his own blood come on he and paul said it like this i believe he said be careful of how you handle the flock of god come on which the holy ghost has made you oversee as he said because god has purchased them come on with his own blood hallelujah god thought she was worth it didn't he he thought she was he you were so valuable to god that he says how much is the cost hallelujah nobody couldn't pay the cost but he said that he the only one he the sin demanded justice come on but god had the answer god paid the price didn't he come on you was that much you was that valuable to god that god paid the price for you come on and then he he give him a charge and say touch not my anointing come on do my prophets no harm hallelujah they belong to me they're mine oh jesus come on oh thank the lord hallelujah aren't you glad tonight that god purchased you with his own blood come on you are valuable to god i said a lot of times the thing is as we talking about value tonight come on a lot of times you know like he says you paying money for that that don't satisfy you laboring for that ain't satisfying you know he says but come you know a lot of times we pay a lot of money for a lot of things but it don't mean nothing does it but but salvation is free tonight you know salvation is free god ain't charging you a dime for it is he he's saying come ye without money and that's what you try to convince people come on the devil beating you down ain't the devil beat you enough come on ain't you been bound enough come on you know we can't say that that seeing ain't pleasures because the bible says that moses chose not to enjoy the pleasures of sin i mean he chose to be called a not be called a son of pharaoh's daughter come on but to go out there and be with those that were slaves or whatever they call it because he chose not to enjoy the pleasant sin for a season didn't he come on because it's joyous it's pleasure just for a season though come on but what comes in the bible says that the wages of sin come on sin got value to it don't it the wages of it is death i don't know i don't care how many times you know you see that people walk down the same path we know what the end is going to be don't you because you've seen it over and over and over again but what it is is things that entices people you know i was listening to something probably god was talking about how you know people were born when you're born into this world you you the nature that's in you is is the world and it loves that the nature that your nature has seen you loves the world the things the world is be appeasing to you because that's the nature that you were born with come on no matter how good you try to raise that child no matter how you raise that child and keep them away from certain things the things of the world always appeal to them because that's the nature that they were born with but god knows that you know and that's why he says you must be born again until they get the new nature things of the world gonna always appeal to him so that does more than all of our talk and all of our restrictions and all those things come on it's going to always be appealing to them the only time that those things won't appeal to them come on is when they when they get that born again experience when the holy ghost comes in and that means you know a lot of times i say that today people don't talk about that no more all they say come on but have you been born again come on you got to get to that place the way you ain't worried about the world and those things don't entice you because you got something better than what the world has to offer you taste it and you saw that the lord was good hallelujah y'all feel all right tonight come on i don't know about you i said but i tasted it come on and saw that the lord is good i was sharing sunday how the boys at work one of the guys friend of mine say earnest it's my birthday come on i want you just come out and we're going to be down at the pool hall come home you know we know you don't drink we know you don't do none of that come on just come out just have a good time with us come on you ain't going to do nothing but go home and sit on the porch or maybe go take a nap come on i says but the thing about it is i got something greater than the pool hall greater than sitting around talking about yeah when i sit on the porch that's when i'm meditating with god come on that's when god comes down to speak to me and i can hear him say i knew you hallelujah oh jesus you can't hear that in the pool hall can you [Laughter] god is so good amen i said value i know getting all over myself said what it is come on you asking us to come you know it says without money without price come on everything in this world today is dictated by money come on you get treated a certain way when you got a certain money certainly you get treated a certain way you get better service when you got more money come on you get access look like to to better things when you have more money but it's something about it you know money money is is something that you know the love of it is the root of all evil it ain't money but it's a love of it right so we find today everything is dictated by money come on i was speaking at my dad's name i was telling him he was like man gas five dollars a gallon i said good we about to save money well how you gonna save money cause we ain't gonna be just out there riding around we're gonna be at the house now right spending some family time together praying meditating on the lord because we can't afford to just ride around now get in the car and go there but what it is i ain't worried about that everything's dictated by money come on got to work a little extra got dudes right here now to pay these bills but you know the price is going to keep going up not just with gas food everything price is just going to keep skyrocketing come on we're looking at it today on the job things that you could use to get overnight you can't get it overnight now four weeks six weeks and it's ten times more than what it was come on but what it is squeeze coming on the whole world but what is it doing it's pushing us i don't know about you but it should be pushing you that closer to god we ain't concerned about these things because we know that our god come on our father owns every cattle on the hill he ain't dictated by money come on without money without price hallelujah oh jesus i said what it is value come on we look at it we can look at it from so many different angles i said the thing is a lot of things that we count valuable don't really mean nothing come on it's going to be ashes after a while come on ain't going to be nothing but what's value what's the real value tonight real value is in your soul where you going to spend eternity at come on you can't value in this life come on hear the day gone tomorrow friend of mine now in the hospital you know having some issues and he knows he's afraid and all these things but what it is you might value your life but tomorrow you might wake up something else something wrong come on so what it is where is it where is the real value what means more to you than anything come on i said your soul out to me more than you than anything come on we all walked that way we've been teenagers before all these things and look look what happened time goes on come on and it's gonna keep going on you ain't gonna be able to get that one day back but it's a blessing when you can look back at your youth and say i thank god that i gave him my life when he called on me i didn't understand it even right right then right away but i'm glad that i had the ability to hear that call i'm glad i had the courage to walk away from everything else that people are picking at you laughing at you i'm glad i had the courage god gave it to you amen me and brother damon was telling my son moses the other day how how rough i had it when the lord called me and how the people picked at me and laughed at me i said but god gave you the courage to stand i didn't even know what it was all about but something greater was calling on me come on god just allow you to see your life and where it was going the path that it was headed down but he gave you an option he gave you a choice hallelujah and i'm so glad tonight that i made the right choice and that's what we try to tell people today that's what all our minister and crying out is about make the right choice make god your choice don't be like the young rich ruler come on he wanted eternal life but he didn't want to give up what he thought was valuable he didn't know what real value was hallelujah but maybe he found out one day when he lifted up his eyes come on oh jesus i said god is good tonight value come on i said what what's what's the real value come on i was thinking about you know like i'm saying on sunday i said the thing is we don't we as as a people sometimes we don't know what real value is i liken it to a carpenter that says or some remodel or something might look at old house beat down flow falling in ceiling falling in and all these things and then he might somebody might say they want twenty thousand for it you say it ain't worth twenty thousand it depends on who looking at it to what the value of it is because the person that's looking at it got to have a vision for it come on got to know what the potential of it is and that's what it is when it comes down to you and in our lives come on the world i don't know about you but they throw me away long time ago you didn't have no value when you couldn't give to them no more when you couldn't uh support them no more come on when you didn't when you wasn't worth it come on because you washed up somebody else new on the scene now come on they got a new friend now you lost your value come on but it ain't so with god hallelujah even with him his value he gets better all the time he never loses his value come on but i said that the right person looking at it he can see the potential in it can he come on now he might have to rip the floors out the remainder that's left the little that's left he might have to rip that out come on but he gonna start over new the roof that's leaking somebody said well we can just patch it up come on but i don't believe god does no patch up work come on you tear that roof out and put a new one down come on all things become new right god don't do patch up work he don't just put you on a new leaf but when god get done with you you brand new come on you might have been one thing one day but tomorrow you brand new because god's gotta hold to you hallelujah you're walking in newness of life you walking with your head up because you know where you had it at that's because god doesn't gotta hold to you hallelujah oh jesus i thank god you know i said what it is value come on you got to realize the value come on what real value is come on you got to realize what real value is what the potential is come home what you living for now is it going to be worth it remember everything gets old everything starts to fade away come on but with god he get better all the time don't he a reminder stirred up i was sharing with my grandma and i closed i didn't want to be long tonight about sharing my grandma we went up to the mountains i said grandma show you these pictures we went up to the mountains and uh so i pulled the pictures up and i began to show her i said we up on the mountaintop right here she looked at the pictures and and the first thing she said while that lady ain't got no clothes on [Laughter] she let woman had all shorts she said they do that up there in the mountains too and that's all she talked about that lady she said how she gonna get to heaven with no clothes on i said grandma you know one thing you might say you old and you you're tired you're sick and you're weak i said but one thing you never lost and that's your religion you know what she said i ain't gonna lose how could i lose that she said i'll never lose that you know so she began to stir me up why because that's one thing in her life that never got old that's one thing in her life that never got boring that that she never got tired of come on that makes her stronger every day she might be talking about how her knees hurting her leg hurt but then you begin to talk about the lord and she'll she'll lift up right here and say oh glory come on come on she come on my wife though she's she'll she'll be sitting there talking about her needs but you get to talking about the lord she'll say oh thank you jesus she'll be getting to wave in her hand and say thank and then the quickening power might hit her and she just getting moving and jerking i said that's one thing that didn't get old that's one thing that the devil can't touch he might touch your life i said god if you if you spare my life for you terry that long i want to be that same way god if i'm 90 years old don't let it get old lord hallelujah oh jesus the bones might start hurting but when the quickening power comes hallelujah i believe in that my grandma she had her hair done all up i said grandma you looking body good she started laughing she said my dad said she was moving the freezer the other day say she had them move a chair and then she didn't like the way it looked over there so she told them to move it over here and they said they my dad and my my cousin started going back for a widow you just told us to move over there and say she told get out the way i'm moving myself [Laughter] she got behind that chair and started moving then she talked about moving the deep freezer she told y'all take it too long i'm gonna move it and i said grandma that's how you was gonna move and she said i don't know but i was gonna move it come on but what did i say you feeling mighty good but i believe i believe in the power of god do you believe that i believe god stirs you up come on oh hallelujah i said that's one thing about it and i i say you know tonight you know it stirred me up when i went up there to the mountains i got a whole sermon i was going to preach it last week on the mountaintop as soon as we got out the car and got to walking brother simmons called us and i was talking to him he said wait he said get out of bed i said i ain't in the bed all right i tried to go up the mountain i couldn't hardly breathe he said well how far is it so only about a mile he said y'all like to be able to do that i said we tried but one thing he said to me say y'all you got to be conditioned come on but you know the lord was speaking to me said on this journey you got to be conditioned on this journey you ain't going to make it any kind of way but as we were walking you know going on up the mountain the ladies say come down she said it's benches all up down here she said about every so many feet you need to use them i didn't know what she was talking about till we got a little further down that i had to sit down but the lord began speaking to me he said you know whoever created this path they knew it was gonna be a hard path they knew you weren't gonna be able to walk it all in one stroke so they made provision for you to sit down and rest a little while and i started thinking about this journey come on that we on going to glory hallelujah come on god i was speaking to me going on up the mountain i said god know we're going to get tired sometime he know we going to get weak god no you got struggles in battles he don't ask you to run it all in one stroke so every now and then he'll give you a place to wrestle a little while come on hallelujah get your wind back up oh jesus hallelujah come on on this journey well we started going on up and you know people coming down we you know about i'll tell you it's uphill climb and somebody walked by me and this guy that was walking they say y'all they didn't have her there yet so i began to say to myself i said you know that's how people discourage you on this christian journey you start having battles and trials come on even a person sit beside you in church sometime might discourage you come on oh jesus but nevertheless i come too far to turn around now oh jesus you won't know what the top is like unless you get there oh jesus come on so we're going on up the mountain i tell you the lord gave me a whole sermon i had the whole spiritual experience i shared with my grandma she said you need to come down to mueller's and preach it i said we're going up and uh you know somebody people coming around the corner they begin to tell me and the guys walking with they say y'all keep on going it's right around the corner come on i begin to say lord i can hear the saints of old come on calling out to us don't give up hallelujah it's right around the corner don't you know that it's right around the corner you're right around the corner might be tomorrow but if you give up now i don't care how tired you are come on oh i was stirred up hallelujah right after the people told us it's right around the corner another man said yeah but when you get around the corner you got a steep climb up to the dome i say ain't that the devil so ties come on come on so i said i stopped and sat down the other guy i told him i ain't gonna hold you up you keep on going come on so he left me come on but i got my wind back up come on oh i thought about turning around hallelujah but i said if i turn around come on all of my other running gonna be in vain come on ain't it hallelujah i asked my grandma the other day i said i wonder why people run for the lord 60 years then decide they want to go out there come on go into wearing pants drinking all these other things and you don't ran for the lord 50 to 60 years why'd they turn around you know my grandma said they ain't had it right come that's the on though ain't it come on after god that brought me through this i'd have made it through that come on i don't been through the storms in the rain and i'm

zion god tonight as we read from first corinthians 13 i mean 11 23. we appreciate the lord appreciate the word savage is going to have communion feet watching we're just going to have communion tonight but we thank god for you coming it says here for i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remember to me after the same matter also he took the cup and when he had sucked sand this cup is the new testament in my blood this new year is often as you drink it in remembrance of me as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drank up that cup for he that eaten and drank and unworthy eaten the drinking damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body but this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together until condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come we thank the lord the lives we sing in him we get prepared thank god for you by the grace of god the blood brother going sing or something god is good amen you know one one person said you said you're damn if you eat unworthy and you're damn if you don't eat so there's no getting away from him we aren't to take communion and if we don't take communion he said you have no part with me isn't that right so what happens is people try to escape it and there are others that don't deserve the law of the body but what we got to realize that we make a a commitment to christ and we dedicate our lives to him communion is showing the lord that i've done that i've given my life to you and i come to recognize his dying because i've died to myself also are you with me so we're fellowshipping with him and remembering what he did for us are you with me and god bless you again get ready oh the blood of jesus oh the blood of jesus amen [Music] was
