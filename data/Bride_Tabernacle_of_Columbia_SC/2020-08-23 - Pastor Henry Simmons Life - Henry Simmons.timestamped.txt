[38:42] any pulse or not
[38:44] so we think life is having pulse and
[38:48] breathing and so forth and uh
[38:51] a lot of times when your hearts stop
[38:53] they meant
[38:54] then folks say well you're dead and
[38:56] sometimes when your brain
[38:59] stops functioning we call it brain dead
[39:02] so uh there's many appointed amen that
[39:06] determines whether or not in the nature
[39:09] what are you living
[39:10] or what do you do amen but well i
[39:14] i i'm saying this morning are you
[39:17] dead or are you alive do you have
[39:21] life or are you dead so
[39:24] i want to talk about life
[39:27] and eternal life the greek word for life
[39:31] is
[39:31] zoe that means god's own life
[39:35] amen and then that that that's a love
[39:38] they meant that we call feeling your
[39:41] love and that's a love
[39:42] for one's uh uh a wife
[39:46] and feeling your love and that's the
[39:49] love that only god
[39:51] can give and that is a god pay love
[39:53] that's god's love feeling your love
[39:57] that love that you have for your wife of
[40:00] somebody treats her wrong you might
[40:04] amen uh uh uh uh try to abuse your wife
[40:07] you might kill him whether god pay love
[40:10] that you have you'll forgive that person
[40:14] that
[40:14] insults your wife are you with me
[40:18] you pray for their soul that god will
[40:21] have mercy on them
[40:22] are you with me but uh uh feeling your
[40:26] lover calls you
[40:28] amen uh uh it's a jealousy
[40:33] amen it can produce that's human love
[40:37] amen and you can be jealous and so forth
[40:40] whether god paid love you passed the
[40:42] stage of
[40:43] jealousy and all of that amen so by the
[40:47] grace of god god wants to take you to a
[40:49] higher form
[40:50] amen uh of life uh zoe
[40:54] it's god's own life it's eternal life
[40:56] amen
[40:58] eternal life means you have no beginning
[41:00] and you have no
[41:01] end amen but that's that's the kind of
[41:05] life that's only
[41:06] god can give you that kind of life amen
[41:09] but we find that that was a a
[41:13] a separate let's go to john 5 and 24
[41:16] amen john 5 and 24.
[41:20] so by the grace of god we we come to
[41:23] stages
[41:24] with with uh man we we're talking about
[41:28] life and we're talking about when we
[41:30] talk about
[41:31] life and we talk about uh love
[41:35] amen because you can't talk about life
[41:38] and not
[41:39] intertwine it with love because amen
[41:42] because
[41:43] when we talk about real genuine life
[41:46] that's only god it comes from god and
[41:48] god is
[41:49] love are you with me
[41:53] so as we think on that amen
[41:56] we think on love that's like like i say
[41:59] there's a
[42:00] video and there's a god pain and then
[42:03] there's another type
[42:05] of what we call love and that's what
[42:08] most people and young people
[42:09] especially are caught up in lust
[42:15] and they call us a form of love i
[42:19] love you because i love how you look
[42:23] and not love amen uh
[42:26] uh because a person does not have their
[42:29] god pay love
[42:31] then there's another kind of love that
[42:33] takes over
[42:34] it meant because a man thirsts for the
[42:37] living god
[42:38] and not in the inside it's a it's a
[42:41] thirst for god
[42:43] amen and and if you don't uh
[42:46] have god's love there then there's
[42:49] another type of love
[42:51] amen that takes the place that we try to
[42:54] fill
[42:54] that void and we're trying to fill that
[42:57] thirst
[42:58] with lust and not because
[43:02] uh the love of god is not in you amen
[43:05] and then there's an emptiness there amen
[43:08] then we try to feel
[43:09] that desire amen that thirst
[43:12] amen with the pornography and all kind
[43:15] of stuff because of the empty place
[43:18] because agape love is not there
[43:21] and god's love is not there amen
[43:24] so we began to engage in all kind of uh
[43:28] essential things and lust
[43:31] for things and amen we got to begin to
[43:35] try to fill
[43:36] they met the void and the thirst that's
[43:39] in the inside of us
[43:40] because amen we won't let god take his
[43:43] right place a position in our lives
[43:47] and if god is not taking that place then
[43:50] it gotta
[43:51] amen you gotta try to feel
[43:54] that thirst and that desire with some
[43:57] kind of
[43:58] event a love but it's only imitation it
[44:02] will not last it will not hold up it
[44:05] will not
[44:06] satisfy you are you with me
[44:10] the soul will never the thirst and the
[44:13] soul will never be satisfied
[44:15] amen just what feeling yo amen just with
[44:18] a
[44:18] lust for tight love it would not be
[44:22] satisfied so it will fill
[44:25] amen with that god paid love and amen
[44:28] with the life
[44:29] that only comes from zoe god's own life
[44:33] if we have that kind of life down inside
[44:36] of us
[44:36] amen then amen brothers and sisters we
[44:40] can
[44:40] go forth amen but we got to have that
[44:44] zoy tight life the life of god
[44:47] down in his side and jesus said
[44:51] amen i won't quote saint john 14 but
[44:54] jesus said
[44:55] i am the way the truth and the life
[44:58] and that is eternal life that's god's
[45:01] own life
[45:02] amen i am the life amen
[45:05] so jesus offered us amen i go to prepare
[45:09] a place for you
[45:11] there is a place for you in that place
[45:14] that
[45:14] god has prepared he said i will not
[45:18] amen let not your hearts be troubled
[45:21] amen don't be troubled amen we're
[45:23] trouble and be perplexed about many
[45:25] things
[45:26] amen but god said don't let your heart
[45:29] be troubled
[45:30] amen because we're troubled amen and
[45:32] we'll burn them and
[45:34] and we're trying to understand life and
[45:36] they're trying
[45:37] they meant to we'll make it through life
[45:40] and and life has its ups and downs and
[45:42] it's disappointments amen
[45:45] but amen but this life
[45:48] you'll never be disappointed with jesus
[45:51] christ
[45:52] in who is our life golovkin said christ
[45:55] who is our life
[45:56] when he shall appear amen and i want the
[46:00] love of god
[46:01] the life of jesus christ to appear to
[46:04] you and i that's what took away that
[46:07] voidness that emptiness that thirst
[46:09] that life even jesus christ in our life
[46:13] has appeared to us we have seen his
[46:16] love for us amen
[46:21] so by the grace of god it says here in
[46:24] uh
[46:24] saint john 5 and 24 he says
[46:30] verily verily i say unto you he that
[46:33] hears my word
[46:35] and believing on him that sent me has
[46:39] everlasting life are you with me
[46:45] if you believe the word of god
[46:50] amen i i want you to know that you
[46:53] have everlasting life
[46:56] amen and that life amen
[46:59] produces a character
[47:04] the way you know that you have that
[47:07] eternal life inside of you amen
[47:11] it's identified by its own
[47:13] characteristics it's
[47:14] action your emotion prove that there's
[47:17] something inside of you
[47:19] that can forgive those that uh persecute
[47:23] your speak
[47:24] all manner even against you falsely
[47:27] you can have something down in the
[47:29] inside
[47:30] that would say father forgive them
[47:33] because they don't
[47:34] understand what they do amen because you
[47:38] got something that proves
[47:40] they meant that you have another nature
[47:43] another character
[47:45] you don't have your own life you have
[47:48] his life
[47:52] amen believe on him shall not come into
[47:55] condemnation
[47:58] on judgment but his past from what
[48:02] your past from death to life amen we
[48:06] were all dead
[48:07] and trespassing our sin
[48:10] as i said on yesterday the bible says in
[48:13] adam all
[48:14] died amen every one of us that we're in
[48:18] adam amen
[48:20] all died in adam amen and we find
[48:23] in romans uh five it says
[48:26] that uh for by one man disobedient many
[48:31] were made
[48:32] sinners they met because adam and eve
[48:35] amen
[48:36] because when adam ate up the tree of
[48:38] knowledge and good and even he
[48:40] ate up the tree amen they died
[48:44] because jesus god said the day you eat
[48:46] of the tree
[48:47] they meant that day you'll die they made
[48:50] they didn't physically die
[48:52] that same physical day but that same
[48:55] spiritual day with god for one day with
[48:58] god is that a thousand years
[49:00] and a thousand years there's one day no
[49:02] man has never lived one day in god's
[49:05] sight
[49:06] they meant but look methuselah lived 969
[49:10] years but he died amen
[49:12] so no man lived a thousand years what
[49:15] god promised
[49:16] amen that there will be a day amen that
[49:19] the children of god will be reconciled
[49:22] back to god
[49:23] and there'll be a day amen called the
[49:26] millennium rain the 1 000 years
[49:29] rain that will reign with him a thousand
[49:31] years
[49:33] they meant we'll live a thousand years
[49:35] amen
[49:36] so here god is gonna renew amen
[49:40] because amen when adam and eve sinned
[49:43] amen god put
[49:45] cherubim to amend to keep them from the
[49:47] tree of life
[49:48] amen he said at least they come and eat
[49:51] of the tree of life
[49:52] and live forever so he put them out of
[49:54] the garden amen
[49:56] and god he meant put amen his divine
[50:00] for living creatures amen and he put uh
[50:04] matthew mark luke and john
[50:07] he put the amen the lion amen he put he
[50:10] met the
[50:11] ox he put the man and he put the eagle
[50:15] there
[50:16] he meant to protect the way to the tree
[50:18] of life
[50:19] and that tree of life was the book of
[50:22] acts
[50:23] amen where the holy ghost fell and where
[50:25] the power was so
[50:27] that we can eat of the tree of life amen
[50:30] the tree of life
[50:31] is the gospel of jesus christ amen
[50:35] jesus said i am the bread that came down
[50:38] from heaven
[50:39] if a man eat of this bread he'll never
[50:42] die
[50:43] amen he said except you eat my flesh
[50:46] and drink my blood you have no life
[50:50] whatever you eat amen he said now
[50:54] amen i don't want you to think he meant
[50:56] this physical thing
[50:58] the amen but i want you to know uh amen
[51:01] the word
[51:02] is spirit and the word is life
[51:06] amen eat the word of god
[51:09] amen and you live forever amen
[51:12] you don't have to die if you eat this
[51:15] bread
[51:16] you'll never die if you eat the flesh of
[51:20] the son of man
[51:21] amen you never die
[51:24] amen hallelujah
[51:28] we're not feeding on a man
[51:32] amen but we're feeding no none by
[51:35] the word of the son of man it's the word
[51:38] of god
[51:39] that we're feeding on and where the
[51:42] is is
[51:42] that where the eagles be gathered amen
[51:45] this
[51:46] is fresh manner for you and i this is
[51:49] the eagle age amen
[51:51] and this eagle age is to come back the
[51:54] pale horse rider of death and hell
[51:56] are you with me oh you eagles
[52:00] amen that you mine up your wings amen
[52:03] and realize
[52:05] amen that you have an obligation and a
[52:07] job to do
[52:09] amen this amen when death is riding
[52:12] through the land
[52:13] amen now also there's an eagle anointing
[52:16] and that eagle anointing has given life
[52:19] to the bride of the anointing
[52:21] that's on the people of god and not
[52:24] anointing
[52:25] or the holy ghost caused the eagle so do
[52:28] they fly
[52:29] above all the winds and stones of life
[52:33] amen and to be able to exemplify and to
[52:37] manifest
[52:38] amen what a son or daughter god is
[52:42] we are the overcomers in the sage
[52:45] we can walk in victory we can conquer
[52:48] our doubts
[52:49] we can conquer our field we can walk
[52:53] and be holy holy unto the lord
[52:57] are you with me god is calling amen holy
[53:00] ghost filled people
[53:04] i want you to see your past from death
[53:07] to life
[53:09] so as that separation and many times
[53:13] in terminology we said death is to be
[53:16] separated from god
[53:18] and man by sin was separated from god
[53:22] and because of sin we were separated
[53:25] from god and we needed to be united back
[53:27] to god
[53:29] amen uh sin separates but
[53:32] love amen unites
[53:35] amen the love of god jesus came
[53:39] amen to the chasma and the separating
[53:43] amen that we couldn't get back to god we
[53:46] couldn't eat of the tree
[53:47] of a life eternal life amen but god
[53:51] made a way through his son through jesus
[53:54] christ that we could get back
[53:55] to the tree of life and amen so jesus
[53:59] christ said
[54:00] amen if a man believe on him for god
[54:03] so loved the world that he gave his only
[54:05] begotten son
[54:06] the whosoever believe in him should not
[54:09] perish but
[54:10] have eternal life have everlasting life
[54:13] are you with me so god made a way
[54:16] that you can get back to uh amen
[54:19] that what separated us amen
[54:23] would not keep us separated from him
[54:26] amen sin
[54:27] will keep you separated sin will keep
[54:30] avoid there
[54:32] but love in that praise god the love of
[54:35] god would bring us
[54:37] back bring us back into fellowship
[54:40] bring us back into unity bring us back
[54:42] into oneness

[54:54] don't have to worry about getting up
[54:56] out of the grave amen but we can rest
[54:59] in peace then the resurrection morning
[55:02] when death
[55:03] prison bars are broken we shall rise
[55:06] hallelujah
[55:07] we shall rise amen there's gonna come a
[55:10] time amen
[55:11] when the chains of death we don't have
[55:13] to fear anymore
[55:15] we don't have to be afraid anymore amen
[55:17] because why
[55:18] amen but he said in revelation 21 and 8
[55:22] but the fearful and abominable
[55:24] amen and adulterers and fornicators and
[55:27] all liars
[55:29] going to be thrown in the lake of fire
[55:32] amen
[55:33] which is the second death are you with
[55:35] me praise god amen
[55:37] but here god amen through jesus christ
[55:41] amen came amen what death calls
[55:44] sin calls the death amen and because of
[55:47] what that called
[55:49] amen god came he meant to die
[55:52] amen for our sins he met the bridge the
[55:55] cap
[55:56] he met he come to amen uh abolished
[56:00] enmity it meant oh he come to take care
[56:04] amen and to be that lamb that sacrifice
[56:08] amen
[56:08] to bring us back to god to pay the price
[56:12] amen uh amen that adam amen
[56:15] lost amen holy god became
[56:18] a flesh they meant to die on the cross
[56:21] he that knew no sin was made sin
[56:25] for us that we might be made the
[56:28] righteousness of god
[56:30] in him amen god has made you
[56:33] righteous god has sanctified you holy
[56:37] god has took taking your place he took
[56:40] our place
[56:43] oh yes it is oh hallelujah
[56:48] what uh what a people we ought to be
[56:52] so as we look at the aspect amen
[56:57] the agape love the different types
[57:02] of of love and life
[57:06] i want to say life is what
[57:10] controls uh life is what controls our
[57:15] emotions
[57:19] life is what gives you your emotions
[57:26] because then you are known
[57:29] amen everybody know you by your emotion
[57:32] by the way you act
[57:37] the way you act the people say i know
[57:39] you
[57:41] amen what what your life is manifesting
[57:45] that
[57:45] and what they see you what what and what
[57:48] you saying amen
[57:49] people begin to know you by your
[57:52] emotions
[57:55] not only that but
[58:00] your emotions make up what you
[58:03] are and is your life
[58:07] and what kind of character should be
[58:10] we be if we claim
[58:13] to have eternal life what kind of
[58:16] character should we have if we claim we
[58:18] got eternal life
[58:19] what kind of character should we have
[58:25] now there's only one type of eternal
[58:28] life
[58:29] and that is god life
[58:35] that was the great spirit in the
[58:37] beginning
[58:39] the seven spirits of god
[58:43] like seven rainbow colors
[58:48] each spirit comes off of it
[58:52] perverts and come down
[58:56] are you with me so
[59:01] that great fountain of love
[59:05] that seven i i wonder why some folk want
[59:08] to use the rainbow
[59:10] knowing that that's god covenant knowing
[59:13] that that
[59:14] great fountain of love you know
[59:17] sometimes the devil would pervert what
[59:20] god
[59:21] has but god nevertheless
[59:25] the foundation of god's standards issue
[59:29] having the seal the lord knows them that
[59:32] are his
[59:34] god knows his own children
[59:38] as i conclude this morning it's very
[59:41] short
[59:42] so as i conclude i want to go to romans
[59:45] 8.
[59:49] romans 8 and um
[59:53] life and i want to say
[59:57] that first corinthians tells us 15 and
[1:00:00] 21
[1:00:01] right around there says for in adam all
[1:00:03] died
[1:00:04] even so in christ shall all be made
[1:00:06] alive
[1:00:08] are you with me so brothers and sisters
[1:00:11] if you're not in christ you're dead
[1:00:14] i was dead but what makes me alive
[1:00:19] is jesus christ in the inside
[1:00:26] everybody that's born of a woman was
[1:00:28] born in sin
[1:00:29] shaped it in the nicotine and the bible
[1:00:31] said the wages of sin is death
[1:00:37] so you were born still born you're born
[1:00:40] dead that's why you needed life
[1:00:44] and jesus come to resurrect us from the
[1:00:47] dead
[1:00:48] that's why in ephesians said you has he
[1:00:50] quickened you had been made alive which
[1:00:52] was dead
[1:00:52] and trespassed in sin
[1:00:56] david said i was born in sin
[1:01:00] i was shaping an iniquity and then
[1:01:02] saying that my mother conceived me
[1:01:06] that's why he said a man that is born of
[1:01:07] a woman that's why he said in me
[1:01:10] paul says it mean that is in my flesh
[1:01:12] dwelling no good thing
[1:01:15] i was corrupt but through jesus christ
[1:01:19] he wants to give us
[1:01:20] make us incorruptable formulating
[1:01:24] immortality
[1:01:26] are you with me but we got to let him
[1:01:28] feel that void in that place
[1:01:30] but are we still lusting after evil
[1:01:33] things and after the world
[1:01:35] he said if any man loved the world amen
[1:01:38] there's a lot of pledge out if any man
[1:01:39] love the world
[1:01:40] the love of the father is what not in
[1:01:43] him
[1:01:44] so if god is not in you because you love
[1:01:47] the world you love
[1:01:48] pornography you love all kind of filth
[1:01:50] and all kind of fornication and adultery
[1:01:53] the love of god is not in you don't fool
[1:01:55] yourself
[1:01:57] are you with me the love of god is not
[1:02:00] in you you still need god in you
