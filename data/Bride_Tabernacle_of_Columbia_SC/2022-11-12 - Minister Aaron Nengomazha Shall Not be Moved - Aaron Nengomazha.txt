[Music] thank you [Music] uh shall we pray and if you have a need you can show by raising your hand God no God sees those hands and he sees the desire that is behind those hands let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this evening Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy that Lord we are able to gather together in your house oh god father for we are told that the richest place is the grave because there are many people that have regrets there are people who wish they could have another chance here on Earth just to have another service in the house of the Lord but we are so thankful father that whilst we are on this part of Eternity you have given us the opportunity Lord to be able or God to hear your word father for you say the blessed is he that heareth the words of this book we thank you Father for being counted among the Blessed tonight father we ask that your Holy Spirit may come and minister to your people that father you may open the the ears of your children Lord for you said unless a man is born again he cannot see he can understand the kingdom of heaven we thank you Father we pray for the hands that have been raised up Lord God that you may meet each and every need Lord it could be sickness it could be finances it could be marriage issues father may you visit them and meet them Lord grant it to them in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may have your seats for a few moments thank you so much musicians I always enjoy the saxophone that's uh and the music is really really wonderful so um note that I don't enjoy uh brother same ones as preaching but I show you I so enjoy the six of them so much I feel like it's too late for me to start learning it but I believe on the other side I'll be able to do it that's one of the things that I'm looking forward to and you're happy to be in the house of the Lord I would like to thank a pastor for giving me this invitation he's an elder and he's a man that we we really learn a lot from and we thank God for giving us pillars that we can look up to praise the Lord so if if we can stand and open our Bible in the Book of Psalms chapter 18 verse 32 this is a midweek service so um we don't want to take a lot of time I have a few slides here so um try to be as quick as possible but doing Justice to what the Holy Spirit wants us to do Psalms 18 verse 32 if you have it it reads in this wise in my Bible it is God that girdeth me with the strength and make it my way perfect he maketh my feet like hints feet and said with me upon my high places may God bless the reading of his word you may have your Sith today we want to talk about for uh a little time we want to talk about I shall not be moved I believe that it's every Christian's testimony to say I shall not be moved not brother sorry so he's a strong brother or this sister is a strong sister yourself as a person you have to have your own testimony where you can say I shall not be moved and the reason why you are not moved David here is saying that the Lord he makes my feet like the Hindus feet now if if if you know anything about you know these animals like a mountain deer right it is special feet I don't I don't have time to talk about that you can go and Google when you get home uh if you have Wi-Fi uh I'm sure you do so it is a special kind of feat because these deers they actually run in the mountains and they can stand on very precarious uh places and they are not able to fall because God has given them specially designed feet and hear the Bible David is saying God has given me feet like the hints feet and he has set me upon the high places so God does two things he gives you the right kind of fit and he sets you on the right kind of plateau praise the Lord you can have the right kind of feet but if God does not set you on the right place you're going to have problems and even if you have you can you can be set on the right place but if you don't have the right kind of fit you're gonna have problems so this tonight you want Christians that have the right kind of feet and whom God can take and set them on a high place because a deer when it's on the high place it's safe from from from from from uh from from from the the Lions it's it's safe from the you know the wild bears it's safe from all these things that try to kill the deer when it's on the high place so when we are on the high place in Christ Jesus we are safe from serpents we are safe from the devourers we are safe from the things that fly under Earth praise the Lord some of the things that trouble us is because of our Dimension we need to come a little higher the Bible says that John says I Heard a Voice say to me come up higher sometimes you just have to come up higher sometimes you need to come up higher higher than the gossip you need to go a little higher than the last of this world when you come up higher in prayer in Christ Jesus the Bible says in the book of Ephesians that we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus our mindset is not here on Earth our mindset is set on things above our thinking our hearts is not here on Earth our hearts and our minds are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise be to God when we come to church we are not looking at the next outfit that the brother is wearing when we are coming to church we are not thinking about the natural things that we are thinking about Jesus Christ we are thinking about the rapture we are thinking that one day in a moment in the trickle of an eye we shall be changed praise be to God that's where our affection is we are not in a competition who is driving the best car we are not looking for the best uh uh you know level right who has a Gucci all those things are fine but we are not setting our minds on those things our minds are in Heavenly places praise be to God if if a man buys a nicer car I say I bless God for giving that brother a car if God gives my sister a beautiful wedding I bless God for giving my sister a wonderful wedding I am not competing with anyone I am competing with myself because I have to die in Christ that I may live together with him praise be to God we have seen so many people fall in these last days and indeed we keep we keep seeing them falling I was you know looking at the news they say Carson has fallen to the Russians you know I I I don't uh Donetsk has fallen to the Russians people falling in other words the city has been has been besieged it has been taken over and and here to everything that God makes my feet like that like the deer to the extent that I am not easily shaken I can make mistakes I can have problems but I stand in Christ and In Christ Alone praise be to God there are winds that come upon the Earth there are wings that come in our lives but those winds are not meant to move us from our place as Christians we have to be established in Jesus Christ the Bible says in Psalm chapter 1 amen that delighted himself in the law of the Lord he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water you are planted in Jesus Christ you are not easily shaken by the things that fly in the world you are not shaken by things that happen on the outside because you are Faith you are planted upon the solid rock Hallelujah because that therefore what he tries to do is to shake you from your place remember the devil is out there to shake you from a place let's read a scripture here the Bible says in Acts chapter 20 verse 22 now this is Paul saying he says Now Behold I go Bound in in the spirit and to Jerusalem so Paul was going to Jerusalem he says not knowing the things that shall come as that shall befall me there save the Holy Ghost witness in every city saying that bones afflictions abide me supposing that the Holy Spirit testifying through the gifts of the prophecies remember agap when he when he when he found Paul and he bound him by by a bell by his belt and that's the owner of this bear shall be bound in Jerusalem so this was not the enemy talking about the troubles that Paul shall face it was the Holy Spirit that was telling Paul the troubles that he is going to face praise God and sometimes we think that if the holy spirit is there it's just going to tell us wonderful things that's not always the case sometimes the Holy Spirit testifies of evil things that shall come before us but one thing that I love about the Holy Spirit is that he will be there with me Hallelujah David says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil because thou art with me praise be to God verse 24 he says but none of these things move me tell your neighbor none of these things move me sickness doesn't move me finances doesn't move me temptations that doesn't move me I am standing on the rock of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Paul was not the kind of man if he's given a prophecy you're going to be bound in Jerusalem he starts to think about his calling he starts to doubt himself he starts to doubt his experience he's a man who says None of these things move me sometimes you need to look at your situation and prophesy I'm saying none of these things shall move me sometimes you see your children going back to the world the devil is after your faith the devil is after you experience but you must be able to say none of these things can move me Hallelujah sometimes you see bills piling up upon your door sometimes you've seen it notifications from your back saying your credit score has gone down your credit score has gone down you must be able to say none of these things above me because I have my trust in Jehovah I don't trust in horses I don't trust and Cheerios I trust in Jesus Christ Hallelujah from whence cometh my help my help comes from the Lord God is able to do that's what she said he will do he's gonna fulfill it Paul says I know that my God I know that my God he is able to fulfill what I've committed unto him against that day Hallelujah these were testimonies that were not given by someone who was in a palace these were statements that were spoken by someone who was in a Roman prison and people when they read post letters they thought he was a fanatic imagine someone who is bound and is in prison and he says None of these things move me I'm not worried we are more I'm we are more than conquerors people think that thoughts Powers lose his mind imagine a man who had no family he had left everything he was in a Roman prison he had nothing and one quote and he was writing beautiful letters we are more than conquerors through Jesus Christ who loved us we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the love of God he was talking about the love of God he never moved from his testimony praise be to God and Abraham despite all the challenges that he went through the Bible says that he stuck at not at the promise of God through unbelief no matter what you got through my brother hold on to the promise of God Hallelujah Hebrews chapter 12 verse 27 the Bible says and this word yet what's more signifies the removing of things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain so God was prophesying through Paul that he was going to shake the heavens again remember before you harvest your wheat it has to go through threshing it has to go through sifting when it's being sifted the chaff will go by the window but the seat will remain When Trials Come praise be to God they make believers they leave the church they will live the word of God they live the message of the hour but the sons of God they remain with the word of God no matter what the situation might be they stand with the promise of Jesus Christ Hallelujah one time Jesus Christ said unless a man eat my flesh and drink my blood he has no life and multitude left him and he tempted to the disciples he says do you want to live also and Peter says to whom shall we go oh Lord only you have the words of eternal life Jesus stated say the statement and he did not explain it if he did it that time he can do it again wash because he is not interested in in multitude he is interested in the seed that was planted before the foundations of the world are you a seed tonight are you a seat tonight saying none of these things move me praise be to God think of Paul when he was when he was two weeks on the sea and you know the Shipwreck and there was there was no light there was Darkness you know a shipwreck is something that is very bad you know if you have a car wreck you know that maybe someone someone another car is gonna come through maybe someone will see your lights you know but in shipwreck you're in the middle of nowhere there is zero out of a hundred chances that someone is going to come by your way that's how bad a shipwreck is but Paul says fear not says be of good cheer the Angel by whom I stand stood with me this night Hallelujah what am I saying I'm encouraging you to to prove to to testify and say none of these things move me I shall not be moved because the devil wants to move you from your position our position is in our testimony remember the Bible says in the Book of Revelations they overcame the beasts by the blood of the lamb and the testimony of their mouth the devil wants you to change your testimony but you must keep your testimony say I believe God I believe Jesus I am going in the rapture Hallelujah there's an old song that we used to sing I'm going up yonder I'm going up yonder I'm going in the Rapture I'm going in the rapture praise God the Bible says which cannot be shaken May remain therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved we cannot be moved by covet we cannot be moved by Wars or rumors of wars we cannot be moved by fine by recessions we cannot be moved by by the Fashions of the world we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken Peter says we are born of an Incorruptible seat there are no amount of drugs that come in the streets that can corrupt a Son of God they are no amount of challenges that can come that can corrupt a Son of God you may have your ups and downs you can make your mistakes but you will still come back to Jesus Abraham light any state of ability that Sarah is my sister but God did not look at that when the Divine account was being written in Hebrews he says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through through unbelief when you come to the end of the journey he will understand and say Well done my faithful servant you understand it say Well done my sister you will understand and say Well done my daughter praise God our mistakes mean nothing before the Lord when we love with all our hearts don't say well I've made a mistake therefore I'm going back to the world forever it just shows that you always love the world if you make a mistake you make it right you come back to church and you continue walking with Jesus praise be to God even when you are married you can't make a mistake and say okay I'm I'm getting a divorce you you probably had your preconceived ideas if you make a mistake in marriage you sit down you talk it over you pray and you move forward that's the same way in church you make a mistake you talk it together with the Lord and you move forward and when God looks at your record he doesn't look at your ups and downs praise be to God you know it's like I I I I'm not a football fan but you know when they talk about things that happen they say okay this team won the championship this team is the champion no man talks about wow how they almost lost that game no one talks about how they had those injuries during their season no one talks about some of the little mistakes that they did it all comes down to a championship at the end of The Journey God is not going to look at your mistakes God is not going to look at your problems he is going to Crown you as a champion Hallelujah and the Bible says that we shall receive a reward if we faint not the goal is to come to the end of the journey the goal is to finish the race it's not how fast you can run it's not how slow you are going it's are you able to finish the race Paul says I fought a good fight I fit race and there lays for me a crown that the Lord the righteous Church shall give me Hallelujah he had come to the end of his journey it's not he that believes it's he that endures to the end so the test is on endurance praise God I've I've I I ran through in a marathon one time and when he was in high school so when you start there are some who go very fast but guess what they're not gonna go very far because they lose all their energy right if you find people sometimes they come to church they are obsessed with oh the pastors say this about me oh this brother did this you're not gonna go far because you are losing out your energy you must endure to the end keep your your focus on the goal keep your focus on the goal you know they will be when you are running through a marathon there will be arrows saying 10 left 10 right 10 left that's where your focus should be but if you see a man who is running a marathon and then they go outside this way they're not gonna make it just know for sure they're not gonna make it but if you keep your your eyes steady on Jesus then you will reach the goal remember Peter as long as he was looking at Jesus he was walking on top of the water but the moment he started to look sink praise God let's keep our eyes on Jesus let's keep our eyes on Calvary Matthew chapter 16 verse 7 Jesus Christ said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah the word bar it means the Sun Jonah son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto you thou Arts Peter and I point this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it in other words we are set upon a rock we are a holy building sitting upon a rock the Gates of Hell will come shaking this way they will come check in that way but we shall not be moved Hallelujah because we are built upon the rock of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ not the revelation of a church but the revelation of Jesus of the denomination to fail all the churches who fell but Jesus never fails Hallelujah even if your husband goes back to the world you are not built upon your marriage you are built on Jesus you can't stop coming to church because your husband is no longer coming to church you shall not following your husband you are following Jesus sir you can't stop coming to church because you lost your job you don't worship your job you worship Jesus Hallelujah in the sun in the rain we worship Jesus Worthy is the Lamb that was slain there is no one that drives for you except Jesus there is no one that saved you except Jesus not even your neighbor not even your children Jesus died for you you come to church for Jesus I lost my brother like my sister but I can't what Jesus show me Jesus Hallelujah the grace unto Jesus and says yes we would see Jesus Hallelujah I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus if Jesus I really want to see you oh I want to see him look upon his face sir there to sing forever Hallelujah praise be to God are you plotted in Jesus Christ tonight or you are looking at circumstances around you look to Jesus look and leave my brother look and leave praise God there's an old song that we're used to sing he says lift him up lift him up lift him up for the world to see amen don't exalt the preacher don't accept the put the Pew leave Jesus Christ the Savior for everyone to see that's what we want that that's that testimony the Bible says that testimony that there's testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy that's why Elijah when he came in our day the thought that they found in him they said you break too much on Jesus they said you break too much on Jesus every prophet testified of Jesus Christ and if we are a true church tonight we have to show Jesus because we are married to Jesus Christ when we say we are the bride we are the bride of Christ and Christ is the word of God the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail like it is this church they can Prevail against the denomination but they shall not Prevail against the individual that is Faith a revelation of Christ praise God now this Revelation does not come from flesh and blood it's not the bishop of the president that can explain it to Israel it has to be revealed to you to to your to your heart by Jesus Christ himself praise God Luke chapter 21 verse 25 the Bible says they should be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars upon the Earth distress of Nations look at what we have today we have you know UK they say our inflation is 10 you know there's a global financial crisis we have we are facing the longest recession Europe they say well our currency has been disseminated by by the strong dollar you know we are suffering from the war in Ukraine Nations shall have perplexity amen that's a Bible that's what Jesus Christ said in the seas and the way of the Roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and you know what when this scripture was written people thought how is this possible but now today you read the medical journals they say that one of the biggest problem is anxiety and what is anxiety is the fear fear of things that that can come the fear of losing your job the fear of not finding the right partner in marriage the fear of just there is a lot of depression and anxiety in the world the Bible says men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken covet shaking the Earth you know there is distress and politics and you know meat terms and red waves Blue Wave all kinds of things that are affecting people and man ah people you know they're just anxious do I have enough money for retirement if I served enough for my children will I ever be able to to to to finish my mortgage what if my house my house is taken men's Hearts failing them for fear but let me tell you something Jesus Christ is the cemetery today and forever those that trust in him shall find refuge in him the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and they are safe amen Luke chapter 22 31 Jesus Christ said and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan his desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you now notice here he did not pray that Satan doesn't come no I have prayed for thee that Satan should not touch you no I prayed for you that you uh you rebuke the devil and he's destroyed no I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and when thou art converted strengthened thy brethren offenses will come the enemy will come the devil will come to sift you like wheat but I'm glad that though he was sifted but he was with if you are a chaff if you are sifted whether you are look no I I don't care how the devil will sift me that will never change my nature if I am with I am with in Jesus Christ said I've prayed for thee that your faith fell not so which means that there is a possibility that it cannot fail but guess what the elect cannot be deceived praise be to God is that what the Bible says Matthew 11 verse 6 the Bible says and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitude concerning John what went he out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the Wind but what went out to see a man clothed in soft Remnant behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but but what went he out to see a prophet here I say unto you and more than a prophet so Jesus Christ is saying John was not a man who was shaken by the wind like a reed he was a prophet and more than a prophet and I want to say to you tonight let let know the devil Shake You by every wind of Doctrine let not the enemy Shake You by every wind of Temptation let not the enemy Shake You by every wind of doubt stand in the Lord stand up stand up for Jesus stand In Christ Alone he is I'm aware stand and stand until you we see him coming in glory praise be to God we have so many weak Christians today because they are not properly born by the Holy Spirit and by the word of God that's why when you know it's like uh Broiler chickens I don't know what you call them here you know there's a free-range chicken or a pasta raised raised chicken if you try to catch it it's not easy you know it's always running you know it can survive but a broiler chicken it's hatched by a hand of man you have to feed it you have to put the light you have to make sure there's the best atmosphere you have to control the temperature because if it gets a little bit cold they can die if it gets a little bit warm they can die you can kill hundreds dozens and the others will be looking they can't run away because they are weak they are born by the artificial hand of men but a pasture-raised chicken what is she he sends his danger brother you can you can catch him he will run because there's something in this life in him if you are born by the word of God not born by a denomination not born by man's ideas you can stand and stand in Christ despite the situations that may come praise be to God are you here tonight are you here tonight they say brother Aaron I've been shaken too many times I want to stand for Jesus Christ I want to take a stand for Jesus Christ amen Ephesians 4 14 the Bible says and we henceforth be no more children tossed to and from and carried about with every wind of Doctrine everything that comes you know takes people away you know every little thing you know false Doctrine if you read galaxian the Bible says and the works of the flesh are these and they list them last and these days and it says and and heresies so heresies and false doctrines they are also a work of the enemy how many knows that but here Paul is saying it in Ephesians you know I love the book of Ephesians because it's a balanced book the book of Ephesians if you read chapter one it talks about you know be in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh this great Mysteries and you come to the last chapter it goes to the basics husbands love your wives wives honor your husbands children obey your parents so the book of Ephesians is one of my favorite books so here is saying that that will be no more children you know one thing about children is that they are immature and because they are immature they are slaves to their emotions if a child wants something they will cry for it they are slaves of their feelings you can't say no to a child because they are immature in their children they are they are bound by their flesh they are bound by their desires because they are children if they want fries or McDonald's she will cry and kick and you know do everything I want McDonald's says no no no honey we're gonna We're not gonna have McDonald's today if if that's what if if she wants a toy she will do everything that's a baby and poisons be no more children tossed back and forth carried with every wind of Doctrine you know a child has no restraint if something if you drop a spoon she wants a spoon if she says something she wants that she says this she wants this she is just you know up and down because she is a child but when we come to maturity in Jesus Christ we are able to say no to ourselves we are able to say not to our bodies we are able to say not to essential desires we don't just give in to our desires oh brother I'm a man of Flesh what am I supposed to do you are a son of God oh brother what you expect me to do it was too much upon me no you are supposed to be a mature Son of God like Joseph he had been away from home he was not married he was like any other young man he had all the passions that come with a normal human being yeah he could have said oh what am I supposed to do you know the woman praised me I couldn't do anything if it means you have to kick the door you have to do it that's maturity but today we don't have that today I'm not coming to church I've got a little headache I'm not coming to church my dog is sick I'm not coming to church it used to be back in the day when someone is sick they say I'm going to church I want to be prayed for it used to be that when people had problems they would come to church but now when someone is sick they stay away from church because they find their healing somewhere it used to be that when someone has a problem or a weakness they come to church they say this problem I'm going to Jesus this addiction I'm going to crush but today people will be like I'm gonna come to church after I quit my smoking how can you do it how are you going to do it without the power imagine if you are sick and you say you know what I'm gonna get healed and then I'm gonna book my appointment with the doctor does it make sense imagine you're in you're in an accident and you say you know what I'm gonna come out of this and then I'll call 9-1-1 as soon as you are in trouble Siri call 9-1-1 praise God in the days of the prophets when he was preaching there will be Wheelchairs and the clashes here on the on the altar because people trusted in Christ they said if I'm going to die I'm going to die in church but today just just a little just just a little I don't know how to describe just like my little finger hurts I'm not going to church just the slightest excuse they won't come to church why is the love of many has washed cold the love of many has waxed code but praise God you have managed to come to church and God will give you the blessing of coming to church praise be to God I don't believe in a I don't believe that apps will solve all of our problems you know people become so reliant on the internet they want an internet religion they want their food from the internet advice from the internet until they are obsessed with the internet but guess what the internet is not going to solve everything Jesus Christ is still the answer to all our problems First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 38. I'm winding down all these Men of War that could keep their rank these are the men the Mighty Men of David that are being described here the Bible saying that they could keep their rank they they were not people who were just you know flip-flopping there are a lot of people who were just you know like politicians today they are saying these tomorrow they are saying that no these were warriors that could keep their rank if he's a deacon he's going to be a deacon if he's an usher is going to be an usher if he's a minister he's going to be a minister if he's a Believer he's going to be a believer today is a not today you are a Christian tomorrow you are in the pub and then the next day you are these and then the next day you are that the Bible says that they could keep their rank they came with the perfect heart to Hebron to make David the king and you know what we are doing tonight we want to make Jesus Christ the King we are not we are not interested in making Joe Biden the king we're not interested in making Donald Trump the king we are interested in making Jesus the king of the Earth Hallelujah there is nobody there is no party that shall solve The World's problems you go to Africa they are complaining oh they did this to us you go to Jamaica they're complaining I come to America I thought that everything everyone is complaining you know what only Jesus Christ is going to solve all the problems praise God I saw folks yesterday they were disappointed yeah on the client of mine they are holding their phones and they were disappointed they were like ah and I was hoping that things would go this way nothing would change until Jesus Christ comes let's read uh in Jude chapter 1 verse 6. I like what the Amplified version says here it says and the angels who did not keep their rank who did not keep their own designated place of power but abandon their proper Dwelling Place he has kept in Eternal chains the thick Gloom of utter Darkness for the Judgment of the great day these angels they are fallen angels they did not keep their rank like today men don't want to be man they want to be women leaving their ring their place of power when God made the man to be a father of the house when God made a woman to be a mother of the house and raise children that's your place of power but they've left their rank they want to be men also I I identify as these and these I identified and start in that living their rank but I'm glad tonight that we have sons of God who will keep their rank we have got Daughters of God who keep their place praise God so the men of David they kept their Rank and these Fallen Angels they lose their destinated place of power and I want to tell you something your position is your superpower if you take a fish from the water you have taken it from its place of power should make it powerless and if you take a Believer from the word you make him powerless remember when the enemy came to if and Adam only he had to do was to take them from the word once he took them from the word then they were finished they were no longer equal with God they were omnipotent because they had left their place of power but tonight I want you to say I shall not be moved from the word of God I shall not be moved from my rank I shall not be moved from my place of power Hallelujah I'm gonna suffer but I'm gonna be a Son of God if I have to lose my job I will lose it but I'll keep my word the word of God I remember one time I got a job I was desperate in Africa and the man says hey look you're you're a CPA we like we laugh you know what you do I want you to you know do this work but you know part of we have we have another company that deals in liquor so we want you to be able to go there visit look at the inventories I said you know what as long as once you say liquor I can't I can't I can't touch I can't handle that especially me myself I'm a minister says but you know we'll pay you good money so that I said you know what I'm going to lose the money I want to keep my place of power if I if I have to suffer I'll just suffer belief in the word of God I'm not gonna be working in a bar or just doing all kinds of things if I want a job it has to come from the Lord remember Cain Eve went to the Bible says in against that Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord but that was came and guess what Cain gave them troubles remember Abraham when he couldn't wait upon the promise and he had Ishmael that was a testimony but it gave them problems and right now what's giving Israel problems is the ishmaelites praise God so you can have something that is outside of the word of God and it can look like a testimony but it's gonna give you problems you say you know what I'm not going to wait for a sister from church or her brother from church I'm just gonna pick from the world yeah you can have a wedding and give a testimony but you're gonna have problems praise God because the Bible says that don't be an equally yoked with unbelievers Proverbs chapter 22 first credit is this too is this too hard I should have not said that Proverbs 22 verse 28 we have to say these things to our young people they have to know that we're not playing games here we are standing for the message of the hour Proverbs 22 verse 28. do not remove the ancient landmark a boundary of property which your fathers have set that's why Elijah when he comes Malachi chapter 4 he would tend the heart of the children back to the fathers he is not coming to introduce a new doctrine he says I preach what Paul preached he is coming to restore us back to the boundaries that were given to the forefathers Hallelujah we were not going God is not going to compromise and say ah these people you know they lived in 2022 what were they supposed to do God says don't remove the ancient landmarks that your fathers have said the landmarks was set by Paul it was said by Peter and the disciples and the Bible says we are built upon the foundation of the prophets and the apostles Luke chapter 9 verse 16 62 Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand onto the plow and looking back his feet for the kingdom of God in other words if you begin with Jesus you have to keep continuing with Jesus if you stand with Jesus stand In Christ Alone Matthew chapter 24 verse this is the second from last maybe I think I've got two more slides and then you know we are done Matthew 24 verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall Works code but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 for which cause we faint not but thought out what we perish yet in what men is renewed day by day though outside we perish though we might lose some some opportunities though we might lose some some some some some some friends so outside we perish but inside we have we are being changed to be like Jesus must Jesus bear heal the cross alone there is a cross for me there's a cross for you Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31 my last scripture but they that wait upon the Lord how he knew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as the egos are they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not fade teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait Darkness shall cover the Earth in Gross Darkness shall cover the people
