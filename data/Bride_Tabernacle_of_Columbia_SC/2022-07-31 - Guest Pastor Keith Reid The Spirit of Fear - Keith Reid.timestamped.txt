[18:55] i can't wait till
[18:57] my day is done and
[18:59] it's all over
[19:02] but coming from the scriptures according
[19:04] to colossians if we could just stand for
[19:05] a moment
[19:07] [Music]
[19:15] when you know where you come from
[19:18] and you know what you could have been
[19:24] you know just how god saved you
[19:29] i wasn't looking for him
[19:33] but he came to me
[19:36] and all i could think about is
[19:39] how unworthy i am of it
[19:44] but i want to thank him
[19:46] with all my being
[19:49] if you got the scripture colossians 2
[19:51] and 9
[19:52] and 10.
[19:55] it says for in him
[19:58] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[20:00] bodily
[20:03] and ye are complete in him
[20:06] which is the head of all principalities
[20:10] and powers
[20:11] let us pray heavenly father we come
[20:14] before you lord
[20:15] we thank you for your goodness
[20:18] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[20:20] for everything that you have done for us
[20:23] and lord god you have been better to us
[20:25] than we have been to ourselves
[20:27] father we pray lord god that you anoint
[20:29] the words lord
[20:31] may it fall on good ground this morning
[20:34] oh god our father we pray lord god that
[20:36] you continue to bless the entire service
[20:39] lord we realize oh god that the fire
[20:41] that you kindled in us oh god no man can
[20:43] put it out
[20:45] we thank you father god for giving us a
[20:47] vision to let us see oh god where we're
[20:50] headed and oh god i'm so grateful for
[20:52] that
[20:53] lord bless the service bless the hearer
[20:56] bless those who god hallelujah that
[20:58] stand in need of prayer and those that
[21:00] need to the deliverance if they could
[21:02] just hear the word the bible said by his
[21:04] word they healed them and i pray god of
[21:07] that this morning there will be many
[21:08] that that will be healed just by the
[21:11] preaching of the word bless us now in
[21:13] your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[21:15] amen and amen you may be seated
[21:19] my little thought this morning it's a
[21:21] little different than where the way we
[21:23] were going but i believe with all of my
[21:25] heart that this bible that we we worship
[21:28] god through and with amen is the very
[21:31] essence of his thoughts
[21:33] and we know by god's grace that these
[21:36] these these words were written first in
[21:38] heaven and then god
[21:40] made a way that they would be printed on
[21:42] pieces of paper pages
[21:44] but we understand that the word is not
[21:46] just a word but the word it must become
[21:48] a living word
[21:50] and we understand by god grace that
[21:52] we were written in this book
[21:55] amen
[21:56] and we're great grateful that our names
[21:58] are written in heaven
[22:00] but i there's something that took place
[22:02] in our day that i'm not sure that
[22:04] everybody realized
[22:06] uh we're beyond by god's grace the uh
[22:09] seven church ages
[22:10] and you know we were in the seven church
[22:12] ages and now we were ruled by law
[22:15] we were ruled by touch not taste not
[22:17] hand or not
[22:19] and of course law can never perfect you
[22:21] it took the grace of god
[22:24] to come down in this age
[22:27] no no no no it's not him that will it
[22:29] nor he that run it but it's god who
[22:31] shows mercy
[22:32] and you and i must understand that god
[22:35] vindicated amen this message
[22:37] and so now the move is on the bride
[22:41] hallelujah what god did yesterday is
[22:44] yesterday but he said he's the same
[22:46] yesterday today and forever
[22:48] he does not change his nature he doesn't
[22:51] change his character hallelujah he may
[22:54] change his mask but he's still god
[22:58] hallelujah
[22:59] often time when god comes and he
[23:01] enveloped himself in the human flesh men
[23:05] seem to miss him hallelujah but he
[23:08] purposely do it does it because we
[23:11] realize that he hides himself from the
[23:13] wise and the prudent but he reveals them
[23:16] to the babes and those amen who would
[23:18] love to learn and understand
[23:20] hallelujah i'm glad that god ordained me
[23:24] in this day to be a nobody hallelujah
[23:27] because being a nobody god was able to
[23:29] make me somebody hallelujah amen and you
[23:33] and i must understand that this is not
[23:35] some kind of riddle this is not some
[23:37] kind of rhyme amen but this is something
[23:39] that god has ordained and it must and it
[23:42] will come to pass there will be a bride
[23:45] there is a bride there is a people that
[23:48] will take on the nature of god and that
[23:51] will do the works amen that he said they
[23:54] would do hallelujah i hear the word of
[23:57] god when the bible said that god never
[24:00] left himself without a witness i don't
[24:03] know about you
[24:04] but i'm a witness of this malachi 4. i'm
[24:08] a witness of revelation 10 7. i'm a
[24:11] witness that god has moved amen into a
[24:15] multi-uh body people that's called the
[24:18] bride of jesus christ
[24:20] hallelujah
[24:22] amen and what we must understand is that
[24:25] this bible is the nature of god
[24:28] a letter form and we must understand
[24:31] amen that god is moving into a people
[24:34] that's going to change from glory to
[24:36] glory
[24:38] hallelujah into the very image and
[24:41] likeness of god hallelujah is that right
[24:44] this is why
[24:46] that you and i must understand our focus
[24:49] must change
[24:52] hallelujah
[24:53] our focus must change to a place lord
[24:58] let your nature
[25:01] live in me
[25:03] is that right
[25:05] because remember amen the bride can do
[25:07] something that jesus could not do
[25:11] and let me explain myself
[25:13] jesus said
[25:16] i am the vine
[25:19] and you are the branches
[25:21] see the vine doesn't produce the fruit
[25:25] it is a branches
[25:27] that produces a fruit
[25:30] but we must understand the branches
[25:33] can't do nothing without the vine
[25:36] hallelujah because it is a life of the
[25:39] vine
[25:41] that's in the branches
[25:43] but it's the branches that produces the
[25:45] fruit
[25:47] somebody help me here
[25:49] we must understand we are here to
[25:52] declare that jesus christ is the same
[25:56] yesterday today and forever
[25:59] and for every branch that will not bring
[26:02] forth fruit
[26:04] god declare i will what
[26:07] i will what
[26:09] cast them away
[26:11] hallelujah so we must press
[26:14] into this mark
[26:16] hallelujah you say well where where do
[26:18] we where do we go from here into the
[26:21] shekinah glory
[26:24] hallelujah we must be go go beyond the
[26:27] veil
[26:29] see human ability can't do this
[26:33] your works can't do this
[26:35] hallelujah we're preaching this whole
[26:38] week repentance repentance change your
[26:41] mind let god change your mind
[26:45] hallelujah because you cannot change
[26:48] your mind
[26:49] it takes the mind changer
[26:51] it takes jesus christ himself to come
[26:54] down into you
[26:56] hallelujah to change your mind
[27:01] hallelujah
[27:03] is that right
[27:07] the nature of god is this existing in a
[27:09] person
[27:11] or a person we call the bride
[27:13] you may never do a miracle
[27:16] god may never
[27:17] work a miracle to through you
[27:19] but you you must be like stephen
[27:22] stephen never did do a miracle
[27:24] if he did it's not recorded
[27:26] hallelujah but he knew that god was
[27:29] still a miracle worker
[27:31] hallelujah you say well what do you mean
[27:34] brother brooks listen when they stoned
[27:36] stephen
[27:38] stephen's nature
[27:40] was just like jesus christ
[27:44] so much so
[27:45] he uttered almost exact words
[27:49] when he was being persecuted
[27:51] jesus said father forgive them for they
[27:55] know not what they do
[27:57] and stephen said lord hold these things
[28:01] not to their charge
[28:03] hallelujah what was it it was the christ
[28:06] it was a holy ghost it was god in him
[28:11] don't tell me you can't come to that
[28:13] place
[28:14] because we must come to that place
[28:16] because they without us
[28:19] is not completed
[28:22] we can't just preach the old message i
[28:25] know you're tired
[28:26] i'm sorry i'm not
[28:34] i'm not tired yet
[28:37] so anyhow we look at this thing you and
[28:39] i must understand what god is doing for
[28:42] us
[28:43] we used to fear
[28:45] bondage unto fear
[28:48] bondage did you know that every time
[28:52] you move as a christian you have to be
[28:53] careful of the bondage
[28:55] of fear
[28:58] hallelujah paul was talking to the
[29:01] church
[29:02] bondage by what bondage by fear
[29:06] that's why we don't see miracles
[29:09] people are in bondage
[29:12] they fear
[29:13] that god can't do it
[29:18] but i'm a witness
[29:20] what god can do
[29:23] hallelujah
[29:24] i'm a witness i had cancer god delivered
[29:27] me i know what he can do
[29:30] hallelujah i've got a little testimony
[29:32] for over a year and a half i've been
[29:34] getting injections in my eye
[29:38] hallelujah it's a long story
[29:41] but nevertheless amen one injection put
[29:43] me in the hospital and i almost died
[29:46] hallelujah because i was allergic to the
[29:47] medication
[29:49] and so can you imagine getting
[29:51] injections in your eye
[29:54] yes it was a mental battle
[29:58] glory to god
[30:00] but just the other day
[30:02] i went to the doctor
[30:04] here in in colombia
[30:06] and they scanned my eyes
[30:08] and the doctor said the leakage is over
[30:14] hallelujah
[30:15] he said you won't have to get another
[30:17] injection hallelujah
[30:20] now i don't know what my doctor in iowa
[30:22] gonna feel ab you know me about it
[30:25] cause every injection costs about two
[30:27] thousand dollars
[30:30] hello somebody
[30:31] sorry for him
[30:32] [Laughter]
[30:34] but my god is still god
[30:38] hallelujah
[30:40] listen people i can't belong
[30:43] but the bible said we know that this if
[30:45] our earthly house
[30:47] of this tabernacle be dissolved
[30:52] we have a building of god
[30:54] a house not made with hands
[30:58] eternal
[31:00] in the heavens
[31:01] and when you heard from this you've
[31:03] heard this message you've heard from
[31:05] your theophany
[31:08] that's your building
[31:10] hallelujah you understand what i'm
[31:11] saying
[31:12] so i want to say it like this we were
[31:14] born into this third dimension
[31:17] hallelujah but the birth here amen only
[31:20] was leading us to death
[31:25] so you had to be born again
[31:28] and being born again god burst you into
[31:31] another dimension
[31:33] oh we live right we're in the third but
[31:36] once we realize amen that we're sitting
[31:38] in heavenly places in christ jesus our
[31:42] mindset changes
[31:45] hallelujah the impossible become
[31:47] possible hallelujah god becomes real why
[31:51] because your mind becomes his mind
[31:56] and as long as you stay with the word of
[31:58] god you and his mind god's mind and your
[32:01] mind will be the same
[32:05] [Applause]
[32:07] i don't know about you
[32:09] but i've grown
[32:11] hallelujah i'm sick and tired of this
[32:13] world
[32:15] hallelujah i'm sick and tired of all of
[32:17] the things of the world i'm sick and
[32:20] tired of seeing those who say they're
[32:22] christians being defeated by the devil
[32:25] hallelujah we need somebody hallelujah
[32:28] to raise up and say i am one of them
[32:32] hallelujah being filled with god so much
[32:36] so you don't have to speak all you got
[32:38] to do is lay hands
[32:41] touch them
[32:42] is that right that woman said if i could
[32:44] just touch the heaven this garment i'll
[32:47] be made whole the virtue of christ was
[32:50] so powerful it even flowed into his
[32:52] garment
[32:53] hallelujah come on somebody so was it
[32:56] with the prophet of god the virtue of
[32:59] god was so powerful in him it flowed
[33:02] into his garment
[33:03] it doesn't stop there
[33:06] the virtue of god can be so powerful in
[33:09] you that it'll flow into your garments
[33:13] is that right
[33:14] it goes beyond that
[33:16] the people said if i could just lay
[33:19] into the shadow of peter

[40:01] [Music]
[40:06] may god bless everyone
[40:10] brother henry done did it to me
[40:13] i told them last april i i didn't want
[40:15] to speak to
[40:16] to the ministry
[40:18] i hope this is not not scandalous what
[40:20] i'm about to say but um
[40:24] you know it's it's hard to preach to
[40:26] sinners
[40:27] let alone preach preachers
[40:32] and i just wasn't interested in doing
[40:34] that
[40:37] over the years i've
[40:40] it's been a long time now
[40:43] that god came down and touched my life
[40:46] and
[40:49] i told the ministry yesterday
[40:51] i can't talk about it without crying
[40:54] it's just as real today as it was 38
[40:57] years ago
[41:00] just it has to stay that way
[41:03] and
[41:04] i heard someone say years ago that
[41:08] they were asked a question
[41:10] they said brother
[41:12] what can you give me to guarantee that
[41:15] i'll be in the rapture
[41:16] and and this builder responded and said
[41:18] well the rapture is the absence of sin
[41:22] just keep your life absent of sin
[41:27] just keep your life absolute sin and
[41:29] you'll be there
[41:30] see because god god's presence is the
[41:32] absence of sin and the rapture is the
[41:34] presence of god
[41:36] so it's it's simple it really is and we
[41:39] want to make things
[41:40] uh more difficult than they actually are
[41:44] i appreciate the preaching last night
[41:45] because it was simple brother cliff it
[41:47] was simple it's something anyone could
[41:50] understand and anybody could receive and
[41:52] i think that's the way it's got to be
[41:55] and i keep hearing this this subject
[41:57] brother isaiah over
[41:59] today he said it and
[42:01] you know this word has to become flesh
[42:04] this message we've got is is
[42:07] you know uh this argument that we have
[42:10] in the message of the hour that's been
[42:12] going on for years and years now about
[42:15] what what is the absolute is the message
[42:17] the absolute is the bible the absolute
[42:20] is the prophet an absolute
[42:22] you know and i i i just want to share a
[42:25] little bit with you uh what god has
[42:27] showed me
[42:28] see truth comes in three different forms
[42:33] and every form is an absolute
[42:35] all right truth the written word is an
[42:38] absolute
[42:39] and then the revealed word is an
[42:42] absolute
[42:43] and then what god wanted to do is become
[42:45] the living word
[42:47] and all three are an absolute and it's
[42:50] the same thing with the message
[42:51] the written message is an absolute
[42:54] amen but that will not bring you into
[42:57] revelation god must come down and reveal
[43:00] that
[43:01] to you see
[43:02] and if he reveals it will never
[43:03] contradict any of the absolutes
[43:06] the absolutes can't contradict
[43:08] themselves
[43:10] and so when people say the message is an
[43:12] absolute yeah that's true
[43:15] but that's not going to help the people
[43:17] god has to come down and reveal that to
[43:20] them
[43:20] and and they want us to well we look at
[43:22] paul
[43:23] right there as an example he had the
[43:25] absolute which was a written word
[43:27] see but it was never revealed to him
[43:29] until he met it on the on the road to
[43:32] damascus and and then once he met christ
[43:35] then he became the living word
[43:38] see
[43:39] it's simple it really is and people have
[43:42] made it complex that people are always
[43:43] looking for preachers especially
[43:46] preachers are always looking for a mark
[43:48] of distinction
[43:50] to make them different from everybody
[43:52] else
[43:54] you know that's the truth
[43:56] and i told the ministry yesterday you
[43:58] know the people will make you an
[44:00] absolute
[44:01] the people will do that to you
[44:04] and you as a minister you must be
[44:06] careful
[44:07] to maintain your humility and understand
[44:10] who you you're a grain of sand
[44:12] that's all we are as a grain of sand
[44:15] i tell my church i'm just a grain of
[44:17] sand on a beach in the bronx new york
[44:18] city but i'm an elected great in sand
[44:22] god god put me there
[44:25] see
[44:26] and you know
[44:27] just like brother branham said one drop
[44:29] of water contains everything the ocean
[44:31] contains
[44:32] and so we don't have to be anything big
[44:34] we just got to be who we are
[44:36] that's all
[44:37] and i i tell you this
[44:39] uh
[44:41] this camp meeting has just kind of
[44:43] revived me
[44:45] we've had so many trials
[44:47] i've got a granddaughter back there that
[44:49] had brain surgery a couple of months ago
[44:52] and
[44:53] she was born and there was a hole in her
[44:55] cranium here behind her eye she was born
[44:58] that way and nobody knew it
[45:00] and as her brain began to grow it
[45:03] started pushing into that hole
[45:05] and it was ended up in her in her sinus
[45:07] cavity so she started having trouble
[45:09] with her sinuses
[45:11] and you know leakage and all these these
[45:13] things were happening and the doctors
[45:15] kept giving their antibiotics and and
[45:18] giving her pain medication giving her uh
[45:21] allergy medications and and my my wife's
[45:23] a nurse you know
[45:25] thank the lord my wife recognized that
[45:27] that wasn't really her place
[45:30] 38 years ago she she quit that and she
[45:33] became a christian mother which is a
[45:35] higher calling than nurse
[45:37] and um
[45:39] praise the lord for that
[45:41] i i don't know i i don't mean to
[45:44] knock you down if you're working as a
[45:46] woman and working as a nurse that's not
[45:48] my intention but in our case we just
[45:51] felt like immediately that you know i
[45:53] had i had money
[45:55] i was i was a great white hunter i loved
[45:58] the hunt with a bow and an arrow and i
[46:01] was a fisherman and i did all these
[46:02] things and one of the things i didn't
[46:04] want to do was serve god because i knew
[46:06] he'd take it from me
[46:09] i just knew it right
[46:11] so i finally surrendered to god and just
[46:14] to be sure the next year i went hunting
[46:17] and i shot me a buck there with a
[46:18] shotgun and and i thought maybe maybe
[46:21] it's all right with god maybe i'll be
[46:23] able to hunt it'd be all right and um
[46:26] one morning i woke up i had a jeep back
[46:28] then with a trailer made just for
[46:30] hunting and i woke up that morning and
[46:32] started my my jeep up and i turned on
[46:34] the windshield wipers and cleaned off
[46:36] the snow and i looked and there my
[46:38] garage door was wide open
[46:41] and i saw these steps
[46:43] in footsteps in the snow going over the
[46:45] fence
[46:46] and i went in there and god sent a thief
[46:49] and stole all my hunting equipment
[46:56] took my arrows he took my practice
[46:58] arrows he took my pride my my
[47:00] my hunting uh points and and my target
[47:03] he took everything
[47:05] and i walked in i said lord i guess you
[47:08] don't want me to do that no more and
[47:10] it's okay
[47:13] you know um
[47:14] i hope i'm not going on too much but i i
[47:17] i i
[47:18] you know to get into this
[47:20] it takes more than just a confession
[47:24] it takes more than that
[47:26] you know we and before i knew that
[47:28] martin luther luther did this
[47:30] i remember
[47:33] i think it was maybe
[47:34] 1987 i was
[47:36] in my bedroom praying and i just felt so
[47:38] useless
[47:40] you know i wanted to do something for
[47:41] god so i thought maybe i'll i'll play
[47:44] guitar took guitar lessons for a while
[47:46] and and i seem to have a little talent
[47:48] for it but i just it was like a dead
[47:50] thought it wasn't the right thing so i
[47:52] was praying and praying
[47:54] and i get in my bedroom on my knees and
[47:56] i get to praying
[47:58] you don't have to do the same thing
[47:59] because people want to imitate one
[48:01] another right
[48:02] don't think you have to do the same
[48:03] thing but in my case i i know how i am i
[48:07] got on my knees and i'm praying and
[48:09] praying i said lord i i want to give you
[48:11] everything
[48:12] and i said lord tell me what it is that
[48:14] i'm holding on to
[48:16] and i'll let go of it i promise i'll let
[48:18] go of you and i'm praying and praying
[48:21] and and the lord began to
[48:23] ask of me my job
[48:25] my pension my children
[48:28] and my my wife and my house and my money
[48:31] and my cars and
[48:33] every time i felt like maybe i was
[48:34] trying to hold on to it i'd take a strap
[48:37] and i hit myself with a strap
[48:40] and so i beat myself with a strap in my
[48:42] bedroom
[48:43] years later i found out martin luther
[48:45] did the same thing
[48:48] i didn't know but i just wanted to beat
[48:50] it out of me because i wanted to serve
[48:52] god
[48:53] i wanted to do i wanted to do whatever
[48:55] he wanted me to do
[48:57] you know and i have preachers come to
[48:59] visit us in new york and and they say
[49:01] well brother ivan i'm sure glad it was
[49:02] you and not me
[49:04] and i said shame on you
[49:07] you're there's something lacking in your
[49:09] experience
[49:11] i said because i never chose new york
[49:13] city
[49:14] preachers in this message they choose
[49:16] where they're going to go preach
[49:18] they go look for a place with palm trees
[49:20] and a hammock hanging in the tree
[49:22] somewhere
[49:24] i said but i never did that i said lord
[49:26] send me the timbuktu i don't care where
[49:27] you send me
[49:29] lord i want to serve you lord
[49:31] you know and and
[49:33] brother isaiah's he's told me believe on
[49:36] when when god sent you to new york city
[49:38] he sent the right man i said no brother
[49:40] there's nothing special about me
[49:43] you know i'm just a boy from northern
[49:45] ohio a buckeye i grew up in the woods
[49:47] playing in the river
[49:49] there's nothing special about me the
[49:51] only thing i did was i surrendered it
[49:55] i surrendered that ride
[49:57] and people people want to serve god but
[50:00] they don't want to die out
[50:02] i know what it took for me
[50:04] and i know what the holy spirit listen
[50:06] there's things the holy spirit doesn't
[50:08] allow you to do
[50:09] he doesn't allow you to say
[50:11] he's i call it an emergency break
[50:15] you know you're you're driving down the
[50:16] hill and and the car starts getting out
[50:19] of control god pulls the emergency brake
[50:22] on you
[50:23] that's what the holy ghost is he doesn't
[50:24] let you do that he doesn't let you say
[50:27] those things he doesn't give you a right
[50:29] to choose your life and do what you want
[50:31] to do with your life
[50:33] see
[50:34] i i do believe in repentance i believe
[50:37] that's the key
[50:39] that's the key i told the ministry
[50:40] yesterday that i was in the church three
[50:43] months paying my tithes and offerings
[50:45] thinking i was a message believer
[50:47] and then the lord one day spoke to me
[50:49] and told me i was a sinner
[50:51] and i was so angry with the catholic
[50:53] priest and with my parents and my
[50:55] in-laws because everybody had told me i
[50:57] was a good man
[50:59] and god told me the truth i was a sinner
[51:02] and it changed my life
[51:04] it gave me power to forgive if you can't
[51:07] forgive you're not a christian
[51:11] you're you're lying to yourself
[51:14] hell hell was made for the unforgiving
[51:18] hell was made for the unforgiving
[51:21] if you if you don't have the power to
[51:23] forgive it's because you have not been
[51:25] forgiven
[51:27] yeah and i think we need to preach more
[51:30] on that right go go back to the basics
[51:33] because people are you know i had a
[51:35] preacher one time
[51:36] he come to my my to my church to preach
[51:39] and he had this grandiose idea about
[51:42] about building big churches real fast
[51:44] you know and and building reputations
[51:46] and he said brother ivan listen he said
[51:49] i know how to make your church grow real
[51:51] fast
[51:53] i said is that right
[51:55] he said yeah brother yvonne he could
[51:56] have a big church real fast you know
[51:58] there's five
[51:59] five little cities in one city
[52:02] five boroughs in new york city so what
[52:03] you need to do is have a a service on
[52:06] wednesday and one on sunday and then the
[52:08] other five days have a bible study in
[52:11] every one of your burls and the people
[52:14] that live in your city uh or your church
[52:16] that live in brooklyn gather them
[52:18] together with their friends and their
[52:19] family and and workmates and and and
[52:22] give them a bible study and then invite
[52:24] them to church on sunday and and you
[52:26] know
[52:27] and i said well brother you can't do
[52:28] that he said why not i said well brother
[52:32] what you want me to do is the prophet
[52:34] said
[52:35] that the the statue of a perfect man was
[52:37] like a like a pyramid
[52:39] and that would be like that
[52:42] i said see the foundation is very very
[52:45] wide it takes a long time to put a
[52:47] foundation down
[52:49] i said
[52:50] you can't build it fast now what you
[52:52] want me to do is you want me to build
[52:54] the church this way
[52:56] [Music]
[52:57] very quickly
[52:59] and when you do that any any any little
[53:02] wind of doctrine
[53:03] blow it over
[53:05] i see see the foundation of a church
[53:08] is the is the the family life
[53:11] and i said if i do what you want me to
[53:13] do and i occupy another day of people's
[53:16] time then the father can't be a father
[53:18] the mother can't be the mother
[53:21] see the husband can't be a a husband to
[53:24] his wife there's no time because we're
[53:26] occupying all their time
[53:29] and i said no brother i said the way to
[53:31] build the church is slow and steady
[53:34] and deal with the families and with the
[53:36] children and bring them up and nurture
[53:38] them in the word of god and and i said
[53:40] besides that i don't see the scripture
[53:42] where a pastor gender sheep
[53:46] that's kind of a perversion in it
[53:49] it's sheep that gender sheep
[53:52] see it's a denominational idea
[53:55] thinking that prosperity is big numbers
[53:58] see
[53:59] and brother branham said the
[54:01] prostitution increased 25 percent that
[54:03] doesn't mean that god is blessing
[54:05] prostitution
[54:08] see
[54:09] you know you know what he told me that
[54:11] this message preacher you know what he
[54:13] told me you know what you want to know
[54:15] what i think i said what's that he said
[54:17] i think you're lazy
[54:19] that's what he told me my wife was
[54:21] sitting right there next to me
[54:23] and i said well brother god time will
[54:25] tell
[54:26] tell me time will tell whether you're
[54:28] right or whether i'm right i have no
[54:30] desire
[54:32] to have a reputation i don't have any
[54:33] desire to have a big church i just want
[54:37] the people god sends me that song i see
[54:39] a shepherd
[54:40] a shepherd all he does is take care of
[54:42] the sheep that are born by sheep
[54:45] it's sheep they're gender sheep it's
[54:48] your job to bring somebody into the
[54:50] kingdom
[54:51] and then the pastor takes care of those
[54:53] people see he feeds them the green grass
[54:56] of the pasture
[54:57] and takes care of him that way see so
[54:59] you know that preacher that told me that
[55:01] he rejected the message he left the
[55:03] message three or four years ago okay he
[55:06] never had a clue of what this message is
[55:09] he was just using it to make money
[55:13] drive around the mercedes benz and got a
[55:15] great big mansion
[55:16] see because of the you know what if that
[55:19] were ever to happen to me may god help
[55:21] me to give back everything the message
[55:23] ever gave me
[55:26] i mean it's just dishonesty
[55:29] see you better know who your pastor is
[55:33] i want to finish with this i want to
[55:35] finish with this in your entire life
[55:38] i don't care who you are
[55:40] you may have one man that god sends you
[55:43] as a teacher
[55:44] one man maybe two if god blesses you and
[55:47] you better sit at his feet and you
[55:49] better learn all you can learn
[55:51] because god will hold you responsible
[55:53] for it on the day of judgment
[55:55] you better know who who your pastor is
[55:58] and who that person is in your life
[56:00] timothy understood it was paul and he
[56:02] sat at paul's feet and listened and
[56:05] learned from from timothy and i i've had
[56:08] one or two of those people in my life i
[56:10] feel that way about your pastor here i
[56:12] just need to sit down and listen to
[56:14] brother henry and learn from brother
[56:16] henry you know i'm in a 66 year old body
[56:20] but i still feel like i'm 18. on the
[56:22] inside the inner man never gets old
[56:27] the inner man no get old it's the old
[56:29] man that gets all creaky and noisy and
[56:31] makes makes you feel all that pain so
[56:34] may god bless you we love you with all
[56:36] our hearts and boy i sure wish i could
[56:38] have a me like this in the bronx
[56:41] turn just turn the bronx upside down
[56:45] if i decide to have that would you all
[56:47] come down and
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:55] who knows maybe maybe gotta let us do
[56:56] that i i i have thought about doing it
[57:00] we have two little storefronts that's
[57:02] where we worship we we've uh we've been
[57:05] there 23 years
[57:06] brother gordon was there last year
[57:09] just a little place that's all we got
[57:11] and we've been trying to find a building
[57:13] to buy or lease or do something we just
[57:16] it's just almost an impossibility for
[57:18] churches that don't pool for money
[57:20] and we don't do that right
[57:23] but
[57:24] the reason i haven't had this tent
[57:26] meeting
[57:27] uh and i thought about it over years
[57:29] is because you know i'm sure that if we
[57:32] start playing that music and worshiping
[57:34] god and preaching the way brother keith
[57:36] was preaching brother cliff i will fill
[57:38] the place up but we we have no room for
[57:41] anyone else
[57:43] so you know why have a tent meeting and
[57:45] fill up the church when we don't
[57:47] last year we had over 200 people in that
[57:50] little space and we had 15 or 20 sitting
[57:53] out outside on the sidewalk
[57:55] on metal chairs we just don't have any
[57:57] anywhere to put anybody anybody else so
[58:00] maybe after we get another building
[58:03] maybe we'll do that we'll
[58:04] we'll have a temp meeting there's a
[58:06] little park just just maybe two blocks
[58:09] from my church it's called claremont
[58:11] park and it's right in the middle of the
[58:13] bronx and it's a great big huge park and
[58:15] people fill it up on on the weekends and
[58:18] boy i could just imagine having the temp
[58:20] meeting over there and brother gordon
[58:22] playing his guitar and just oh my
[58:25] goodness we just turned the place upside
[58:26] down
[58:28] and so let's pray for that and you you
[58:30] pray for us
[58:31] uh i've been revived
[58:33] uh it started with brother larry's song
[58:36] on thursday
[58:38] you know we need jesus
[58:40] and i i just was so touched by that i
[58:42] just weeping like a baby i said lord
[58:45] just you know i could i could sit and
[58:47] talk to you about all my problems lord
[58:49] but that's really what i need
[58:51] i need the comforter
[58:53] i need the healer in my life i need
[58:55] christ in my life more
[58:57] it just revived me that song god bless
[58:59] you brother
[59:00] we love you all and pray for us and
[59:04] pray for my granddaughter she's still
[59:05] recovering from that surgery god did a
[59:07] miracle for her
[59:10] they
[59:11] you'll see
[59:12] her hair is real short they had to cut
[59:14] her hair and they cut her open like that
[59:17] and and cut her cranium and they went
[59:19] down in there put a patch
[59:21] in that hole to stop the leakage and
[59:23] push the brain back up where it's
[59:24] supposed to be
[59:26] and um but god brought her through it
[59:28] she couldn't walk she couldn't see out
[59:30] of that eye she couldn't hear she
[59:32] couldn't walk for 30 days
[59:34] but god brought out of it i had brother
[59:35] henry praying
[59:37] and god is a healer
[59:39] i believe that
[59:42] you know they let me just say this
[59:45] i know she my granddaughter is very shy
[59:48] she don't like any kind of attention but
[59:50] i told my church the night before the
[59:52] surgery i said my granddaughter is
[59:54] perfect
[59:56] and if your grandfather you understand
[59:58] that i can't find any any defects in my
[1:00:02] granddaughter she's just perfect child
[1:00:05] you know and uh
[1:00:06] after a week or two after the surgery
[1:00:08] they come in with psychiatrists and they
[1:00:10] gave her all kind of tests and they were
[1:00:12] amazed to know this little 17 year old
[1:00:15] girl
[1:00:16] knows five languages
[1:00:18] she taught herself mandarin chinese
[1:00:22] she taught herself
[1:00:24] she writes it she reads it and she
[1:00:26] speaks it perfectly she speaks the sign
[1:00:29] language she speaks spanish and she
[1:00:31] speaks english and
[1:00:33] and uh just
[1:00:34] she's just a perfect child and she's
[1:00:36] probably angry right now
[1:00:38] because she don't like any kind of
[1:00:40] attention at all
[1:00:41] but uh we love her and i told you know
[1:00:45] sometimes you get a burden like that
[1:00:48] and you don't even know how to pray
[1:00:51] you know i i said i would nail down the
[1:00:53] prayer and say lord i can't even talk to
[1:00:55] you about it
[1:00:56] i can't talk to you but if i talk to you
[1:00:58] i'll just break up or fall apart
[1:01:00] but you know the hurt that i have in my
[1:01:02] heart father
[1:01:04] you know you know all about it
[1:01:06] you just take care of it i'm just
[1:01:08] trusting you lord
[1:01:09] sometimes you don't have to talk to pray
[1:01:14] sometimes you just need to be quiet and
[1:01:16] let him talk
[1:01:19] just just be quiet
[1:01:21] the old pentecostal peoples you know
[1:01:23] what they call it getting quiet
[1:01:26] just get quiet with god sometimes it
[1:01:29] takes two hours to get quiet with god
[1:01:32] your
[1:01:33] your mind stops running
[1:01:35] your mind and your heart is you know
[1:01:37] running constantly 100 miles an hour
[1:01:39] just sit still
[1:01:41] let that all quiet down
[1:01:44] and then something will happen and
[1:01:46] you'll begin to pray and you know god is
[1:01:47] listening and you know he's present
[1:01:50] may god bless you we love you with all
[1:01:51] of our hearts brother henry thank you
[1:01:53] father and and the brothers here to all

[1:08:15] go you can't come again
[1:08:17] praise god i'll bring you greetings
[1:08:19] again from our church in lindstead the
[1:08:21] spoken word tabernacle
[1:08:23] and from our ministers uh
[1:08:26] my former pastor brother brady
[1:08:28] and just like you to remember him in
[1:08:30] your prayers his
[1:08:32] short-term memory is really going and he
[1:08:35] it's difficult for him to preach as a
[1:08:37] matter of fact he he doesn't want to
[1:08:39] preach he doesn't want to pray because
[1:08:41] he'll step from there and step here and
[1:08:43] he don't remember why he's here
[1:08:46] and so you know um just remember him in
[1:08:48] your prayers i i say he has laid the
[1:08:50] foundation for us
[1:08:52] and so we take the mantle and move on
[1:08:55] to the coming of the lord
[1:08:57] amen praise god
[1:08:59] and um after this meeting i'll be going
[1:09:01] to the camp meeting in ruth north
[1:09:04] carolina
[1:09:06] then uh just remember my family
[1:09:08] my daughters are in
[1:09:10] uh kind of moved to canada and so i've
[1:09:13] got to go to see them they move there in
[1:09:15] the during the pandemic and i haven't
[1:09:17] seen them in two years
[1:09:19] where we talk every day
[1:09:21] might be many times for the day but i
[1:09:22] haven't seen them in person
[1:09:24] and i i figured sometimes that is all
[1:09:26] right but with them it's not all right
[1:09:29] praise god so
[1:09:30] amen and you pray especially for them
[1:09:33] too because i i tell them i said listen
[1:09:36] i want to see my grandchildren when i
[1:09:38] can still run around
[1:09:40] and sometimes you know
[1:09:43] they're concentrating on their career
[1:09:45] and everything really
[1:09:47] but i i tell them i said after i i
[1:09:49] school you
[1:09:51] i want you to move to the next level

[1:10:16] strength
[1:10:18] aiming to minister the gospel
[1:10:20] and
[1:10:22] you know to
[1:10:23] i think every pastor need to have that
[1:10:26] evangelistic pulling in him
[1:10:28] because i said sometimes we're going to
[1:10:30] evangelize our church
[1:10:32] amen

[1:46:33] stop talk
[1:46:37] they're not trying to make it right
[1:46:39] they're trying to carry a spirit aiming
[1:46:42] around in the church they're trying to
[1:46:44] bring confusion
[1:46:46] and if there's one thing that david want
[1:46:47] to do in every church he want to bring
[1:46:50] confusion he want to turn bridges
[1:46:52] against brethren you want to turn pastor
[1:46:54] against the member and the member
[1:46:56] against the pastor how do you want to
[1:46:58] turn people against people i want to say
[1:47:00] he do everything in his power he means
[1:47:02] to cause you to disagree with one
[1:47:04] another remember the bible said resist
[1:47:06] the devil
[1:47:07] and he will flee from you

[1:47:17] and i don't like the way you set your
[1:47:18] shirt maybe i tell you i don't like your
[1:47:21] long tongue
[1:47:26] oh hallelujah
[1:47:28] jesus had to look at simon peter the man
[1:47:30] he gave the key and he allowed himself
[1:47:33] to be used by the devil and jesus looked
[1:47:36] him in the face and said get me behind
[1:47:37] me satan for thou art an offense unto me
[1:47:40] israel and love him anyhow
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:44] hallelujah
[1:47:45] oh you know i tell a brother i said
[1:47:47] listen brother he said i love you and i
[1:47:50] don't care
[1:47:51] hallelujah love has
[1:47:53] no limitation
[1:47:56] whether you do right or you do wrong i'm
[1:47:58] still going to love you
[1:48:00] it's a wrong
[1:48:02] or somebody said well i don't believe
[1:48:03] the message no more you hear them like
[1:48:05] out to your guts
[1:48:07] that's the devil
[1:48:08] it's the wrong you never love them with
[1:48:11] any gap in love in the first place
[1:48:13] i love you
[1:48:14] and my desire is that you come to the
[1:48:17] word of god
[1:48:19] are you telling me
[1:48:21] oh hallelujah amen somebody sees
[1:48:24] something different from the way you do
[1:48:26] it and you hit them
[1:48:28] and people that you walk past each other
[1:48:31] in walmart
[1:48:32] and it's as though you never see anybody
[1:48:35] people who used to have communion with
[1:48:37] her that's the spirit of the devil but
[1:48:39] god said i've not given you the spirit
[1:48:42] of fear but i've given you a spirit of
[1:48:44] power
[1:48:46] no that power is to love your enemy
[1:48:49] and if you can love your enemy what
[1:48:52] about brother and sister that sometimes
[1:48:54] for a little while they walk off
[1:48:57] the trodden path
[1:48:58] love them in the hour because it's your
[1:49:01] love that is driving them back to the
[1:49:03] house of god oh jesus my lord
[1:49:07] hallelujah
[1:49:08] amen that's in instances
[1:49:10] aiming a young person marry a young girl
[1:49:13] get pregnant and she was in the church
[1:49:15] and it seemed like she's falling away
[1:49:18] and we push off way off to the side
[1:49:22] and you don't talk to her
[1:49:24] you condemn
[1:49:26] you know some of you the same thing that
[1:49:28] befall them today
[1:49:30] oh if you should open the pages of your
[1:49:32] life when you were young
[1:49:34] you will be fallen by the same demon
[1:49:37] but you'd be as though you were perfect
[1:49:38] every day of your life
[1:49:40] so you push them out in the mouth of the
[1:49:43] land amen that's the time hallelujah
