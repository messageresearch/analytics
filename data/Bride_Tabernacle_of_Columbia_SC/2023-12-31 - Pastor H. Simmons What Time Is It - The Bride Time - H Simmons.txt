that have needs Lord that you'll meet the needs Lord May there be Souls that would dedicate their life to you oh God that would give you their all in all father we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 13 we I was out here this morning and just praying I got excited I got excited because I was just laying I I said I I probably need a rest so I just kind of rested a couple of days and I said Lord you know I feel I'm taking life more serious you can have one bad day just one bad day one day day of sickness and one day of to bring you back to reality that when you're feeling good and you're doing good then you ought to be thankful but one day of pain and one day of sickness then you you kind of re evaluate life so simple so fragile it can go in any time so Romans 13 and 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the arm of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness and in chambering and wantedness not in strife and envy but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof God bless you Read's word you may be seated God is good amen what time is it and we said this the bride time what time is it what time is it you believe that it's the bride time now I want to just look for a moment back at and knowing see often times if you don't know what time it is then how you going to get up you know for work or whatever he said knowing the times I remember the other morning I told Josh I said Josh know what time it is he didn't know what time it was I said you got to work today he said oh oh it's almost 7:30 or something I said yeah and you got to go to work you see and when he realized it was hard time did he get up out that bed I mean it was time to really get up and he had to rush to get to work are you with me and I said well often times we're sleeping when we ought to be woke okay so he he says it's high time it's a critical time that we're living in the day and hour that we're living in what time is it the prophet of God said what time is it sir sir is this the time at the end I believe this is the time all the events that are taking place when I saw you know the floods over in California said the waves was going up 40 feet I said oh goodness I said is this the time that California going to go sink in the ocean and the waves is just I said oh Lord could it be I said I said this thing is getting it's getting tight it's getting close I mean the whole the whole world you know it's it's getting if you look at it it'll get pretty scary it really would shake you up if you look at just a little bit of the news and see what's going on around the world it's is scary and they trying to do all they can to do to keep the movement of the ships going through over there by Israel and all of that and and then uh people are just it's just so chaotic I mean if the ships were are not able to flow through that sea what sea is that black sea or whatever if they're not ready able to flow then economies of the world is going to be in chaos so what happens they we're depending on and the the people are shooting missiles and trying to attack those ships the cargo ships and so forth that they not be able to transport the cargo everything Israel and Under Siege and I mean they uh I mean the world look like they turning against Israel and if the world turn against Israel then where are we the Gentile times will be ending and the Jewish time will set in for the 144,000 the Great Tribulation period to set in we'll see the last part of Daniel 70 weeks and if we're not in Tribulation time or we're not in the Millennium time and we're not where are we what time is it see the Bible said when the fullness of the Gentiles come in that it's going to be a time when the Gentiles space is going to end and God going to return back to the Jews so our time is running out as it is in the world on the world stage time is right rning now when we said if all these events and all these things are occurring then he said look up for your Redemption draweth n the bride so let let me go back here it says and knowing the time it is high time to what to awake out of sleep right to wait you remember in Matthew 25 five virgin was wise five are foolish right and then they heard the bridegroom is coming isn't that right and when they heard the voice the cry that the bridegroom was coming all those virgins Rose and trimmed their lamp and some five of The Virgins all ran out now he says it's high time and I I you know it's a it's a time of the morning sun and the Sun get brighter and the when it get high noon and all of a sudden the sun is getting ready to go down and we're at at the going down of the Sun the evening time the sun is getting ready to go down that means we're getting ready to go into darkness the tribulation period we're right at that particular cycle of time the Great Tribulation is right is it it's it you can see the fuse I mean it's it's it's been Ed and it's going to explode after a while the Bombs over there in Russia the nuclear bombs and stuff it's been shook up as I said the other night the volcanoes are erupting Iceland full of ice but what happened all the fire shooting up all over the world Things Are crucial times so he says it's hard time to what wake up isn't that right it's high time it's it's it's a serious time that we should wake up I'm saying don't let 24 catch you like it caught you in 23 2024 because I believe in 24 it's a crucial time that you have to be ready so he says here for your salvation he says is near than when we believe your salvation is near you know I was excited I mean this morning I I I got pretty excited I got excited because I says if we knew what time it was the bride would be excited about her time it's not what she FES what she's getting ready to do see the bride been waiting on a uh her season to shine and to do the Greater Works she's been waiting on that but there'll be some that don't know what time it is it's time to go to work Josh amen but it's time for you and I to rise he said arise Shine for the light is coming the glory the Lord has risen upon thee it's time to wake up now what are we waking he said for the night is what the night is far spent amen the day is at hand I believe that the day is at hand we believe that what God has sent by the prophet the message of the hour but the day is at hand amen what you going to do the we know what the bride should be doing but is the bride doing what she's supposed to be doing we can hear good great messages and let a pump people up and make them shout and dance well where is the vindication not looking at somebody else but my life it where am I am I awaken do am I stirred am I ready am I on fire is it individual thing yes you can look around waiting on others to get ready but am I ready for the God has made herself ready amen is is you as an individual wake up the bride those that hear the Cry The Voice amen they wakes up the others still sleeping tell you I look at my Christian walk I tell you what I ain't satisfied you satisfied I'm not satisfied and I thought people were asking me to come here and come go

you see what I'm saying you you got to be real you know you got strength you got health and God is calling you into this Kingdom to work at your soul salvation with fear and triing amen it's time to wake up amen I'm going to tell you brothers and sisters and I you know I admire those brothers that know how to do the mechanical work know how to do the carpentry know how to do this know how to do that you know and I said oh boy at least I know how to paint that's what I do know how to do but am I painting you know the thing that you're good at you sat back and relax but I'm saying I want to be about my father's business if I come short in some areas I don't want to come short in my prayer life are you with me I don't want to be come short in my faithfulness to God I want to be able to hear his voice and know what he will because I missed out on some of these things in this life here I don't want to miss the kingdom a fall shot shot in a lot of areas you know what I'm saying but if I want my boys to learn one thing I want him to pray and seek God I want him to be filled with the Holy Ghost that's my number one thing I I want my daughter the same way filled with the Holy Ghost fill with the power of God that's what I want if it takes extra time to to get on your knees and to cry out to God and say Lord I I I want this house where the Holy Ghost has filled this house that's what I want I want I want us to be able to pray till something happen I want this church you know I thought about I was apologizing to mik and I said you know I thought about she had hung up I said to m i love you I said I thought about that I said we don't say we love you it's hard it's hard to say I love you and some you need to tell the church every now and then you love them need to tell the people you love them cuz sometime people don't know that cuz the devil mess with people mind you need to tell your wife I love you you need to tell your husband I love you may not feel too good prove it prove it you know what I'm saying no come on don't give us a hard time when we tell you we love you just said thank you I love you back isin't that right but sometime sometime we don't you know it's hard to it's hard to let our emotions go as it is in the natural sometimes it's hard to let go in the spirit sometimes it's hard to tell God God I love you because if you start honestly uh from your heart telling God I love you things going to happen in your life and you're going to find your life all changed amen you're going to find that it his anointing going to come and his presence going to come when you tell God you love him it's going to take some action it's going to take something out of you when you start telling God I love you Lord amen Jesus I love you he's going to say how you going to love me if you don't love one another you got to love one another in order to love me you got to love one another are you with me and if you don't love one another you can't you don't love me amen so you got to care you got to show that compassion one towards another because it's hard time to awake out of sleep some I don't know why somebody says I'm not going to B on but backwards for nobody you know I ain't going out my way to show nobody no love my love is distance I love you from a distance not close up but we need love with some affection to it some feeling to it and I'm saying it's time to wake up and love God with some affection some feeling in it that we can feel the spirit of God we can feel the love of God we feel it inside of us and we want to give out what we got but if we don't have it in the inside we can't give it out to nobody but we got to feel the embracing of God's arms and we're in his arms we're in his care and he loves us and he cares about us and you want to love him back and tell him I appreciate it I appreciate what you done for me Lord I appreciate you know laying there in the bed and then getting up said Lord thank you I I I'm feeling better thank you God feel good so I got a traged of moments when I when I feel good and realize that I could have been in the bed feeling bad can't walk looking at my brother I was down there preaching thsy he wasn't feeling too good I prayed with him he said I feel bad I looked at him I saids you know just the other day I said bro how you feeling said I said you looking good he said he I feel all right and he did a little jumping y'all know how it is when you get 70 in your 70s and you can jump around a little bit feeling good amen but I looked at him when he I said you know life is so short life is so short but the time that we have and we're spending here let's wake up am 40 foot waves hitting California Co line T down buildings and Los Angeles and all of that supposed to sink in the ocean and America is supposed to have such an earthquake that the country would never be able to overcome that are we at that Verge are we there you can't tell me that these T these big waves hitting like that is not going to affect uh uh a place that's having earthquakes every day look how much of the population how many millions of people would go when California go and what would you do then will you wake up then or will you wake up now and be ready so when if that happens I will be ready if the Lord will come oh Lord I want to be ready if the nuclear warheads begin to go you know somebody going to get tired of those people Israel might get a little tired or tired of all of those countries round about and threaten in them and coming at them they already mad they went in there and they're you know they they're upset what happened you see what I'm saying the world Amen is in chaos they fighting I'll tell you something if if I saw that and I I know what what M foret about the bride then the bride should just oh Lord let me let me get on fire for God cuz it look like this thing coming to an end let me let me pray let me pray through let me get a breakthrough let me get a hold of God instead of set now I'm say well I'm looking forward to the next day next day it ain't the same this world won't be the same just like Israel is not going to be the same over there the world ain't going to be the same in 24 things are changing will it be Biden will it be Nicki Haley will it be Trump whatever it's going to be it's going to be chaos thousands of people coming across the border every day flooding the country what is the American going to look like brother and sister South Carolina is the number one state that people are moving into so things are going to Rocket Sky High how you going to make it brother and sister let's wake up will it's later than you think it's later than you think all that we are saying let let me just read Thessalonians here first Thessalonians 5 I got to close but I thought about my New Year's message and to prepare us for the oncoming storm to get us ready for 24 and what would your theme be for 24 I was telling the church early that there'll be a lot of things exposed God's going to take the cover off a lot of stuff and it's already began to take the cover off a lot of things secrets of men Hearts is going to be made manifested if you're walking and you got dark things and things coming it's going to come to the light let's get it right now because things will come into the light some things going to be very painful it's going to hurt but you need to come on in the light now cuz if you don't do it God going to do it 5 and 12 1 Thessalonians 5 and 12 says I beseech excuse me I beseech you Brethren to know them which lab among you you know something to know them that labor among you and are over you in the H in the Lord to admonish and to esteem them very what highly in love for their Works sake and be at peace among yourselves I'm trying to get somewhere but let me go back to Ephesians 5 Ephesians 5 excuse me and 12 it says for it is shame even to speak of those things which have done in to them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifested by the light for whatsoever does make manifest his light wherefore he says what awake thou that sleepeth and what and Christ shall see then that you what walk circumspectly not as fools but what doing what for the what the days of evil you believe that now let's go back to Thessalonians five and three Thessalonians 5 and3 good I'm having a a time here it says for when they shall say what peace and safety sudden what as travail of the woman with a child and they shall what but ye Brethren are not what that that day I'm telling you it's getting it's getting pretty serious and I thought that these scriptures would ankle down inside of me that these that day would not catch you as a thief but I'm afraid that the spiritual condition of most when I look at myself and I say God where am I where am I this where I want to be is this the spiritual condition I want to be in I know some people jump shout and put on the big front a big show like they got it all but honestly I don't want the talk to talk but I want to walk to Walk I don't want I thought about there there they're great preachers who can really really know how to give good speeches and people they know how to articulate they know how to say words and make things sound so impressive and inspiring and people get it caught up in the the Charisma uh how they speak they wonderful this blow you away and they anointed but yet God does not come down and vindicate what they saying the people feel excited they feel happy they excited but their lives are not changed they live no better they on fire but what kind of fire they stir they excited but their lives are not changed brothers and sisters don't get caught up and excitement something from God where God would come down in Simplicity but he changes your life not that you under some exciting preacher who can say oh God enticing words of men's wisdom but don't have the power of God to come and back it up brother and
