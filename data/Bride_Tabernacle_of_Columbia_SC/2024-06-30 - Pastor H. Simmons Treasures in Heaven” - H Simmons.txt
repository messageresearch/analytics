the if you don't know how to shake just look ugly okay some folks they looking at me I'm mad what you mad about God is good a amen you didn't have to be here this morning but God is good to us thank you Jesus let's go to Book of Matthew 6 and 19 I was addressing just one individual in here with a frown on their face it was just one little young person in here had a frown on their face I don't know who heard him but that's a smile cuz you're on the camera okay God is good 6 and 19 it says lay not up for yourselves what Treasures upon Earth where moss and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and what steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures where where neither Moss nor rust do corrupt nor will thieves do not break through and steal for where your treasure is there will your what also God bless you read this word you may be seated now on last week we were talking about looking to the what unseen look to the Unseen right and we said the world that is not seen is more real because uh Second Corinthians says while we look maybe we'll look that again just for um to bring those that were wasn't here up to part because we uh like continuing where your treasure is there will your heartbe we want you to think on the thought Treasures in Heaven now you can look at somebody and says Treasures Treasures in Heaven in heaven Treasures in Heaven I want Treasures in Heaven amen so uh that was U second Corinthians four let me just oh she got it for me I don't have to go he says for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet our en man is what renewed day by day next for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a for more and what Eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which what seen are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are what temporal temporal but the things which are not not seen a etal Eternal so everything that you see is temporary amen are you with me amen and we said look to the Unseen unseen look to the Unseen now we saying Treasures in Heaven as a continuation Treasures in Heaven because if this world that we see is just a temporary thing then would you like the Eternal Treasures Treasures in Heaven now we were bought with a a decision that a young man made uh some time ago in Jesus day he um Luke 18 for a minute Luke 18 a young man made a decision I think Caleb touched on it on on um Friday night 18 18 1818 Luke 18:18 it says and a certain ruler asks him somebody call him a certain Young Rich ruler okay and a certain ruler asks him good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call thou me what there's none good say one that is what thou know the Commandment do not what do not commit adultery do not what do not kill do not steal do not bear false Witnesses honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these things have I what kept from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said un him yet what one thing he says what s all that thy has in what and thou shallal what trees in heaven I'm talking about this morning Treasures in Heaven amen but you got to sell out to get them amen now which one would you rather have the the treasures here or the Treasures in Heaven see because uh uh most people I don't know whether they realize that there is a heaven because they Treasures that they're trying to uh accumulate not knowing that those Treasures are going to they're just temporary things those things are not Eternal am so a lot of times uh people spend all their life building up a treasure here and I said it's not worth it look to he said the world that we see now it's a world that's going to burn it's going to fade away but the Unseen World is more real than this one praise God but it takes you to have faith that it exist amen that there is a world that exists as we said on last week though our outward man perish the inward man is renewed day by day amen amen if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle where it's all we have a house of building amen a house not made with hand Eternal in the heavens amen the outward shell that you looking at that you tried to it's it's getting old it's I don't care what you do to it it's still going to fade so as as job said naked came outto this world naked shall I return this thing going to go I don't care how much you love it it's going amen you have pains you have sickness you have all kind of stuff in the treasures in heaven so as we look at Luke here uh 12 Luke 12 and 22 Luke 12 and 22 it says and he said unto his disciples therefore I saying to you take no thought for your life what ye shall what eat neither for your what what you shall what you know it it's something about Jesus really getting down to hey the the the very principles of Life of sustaining ourselves don't take no thought of it and that's all you know we here we we're trying to live he said don't take no thought of of it amen sometimes we like to dress we like to you know when I was a young fell I I like to to go to Britains I probably can't go there now I went in Britain's and a tie cost about $100 a a pair of socks cost you about $50 I say oh God and they gave me a coupon cuz I was an old customer I said what can I get only thing I can get with my coupon was a PIR socks I say I I can imagine I I I didn't have time to look at the suits that I used to wear I said because my suits is going to cost me $2 or $3,000 are you with me but by the grace of God but sometimes you should treasure you know you know you want to dress you know uh Dress for Success you want to look like you're somebody amen but doesn't mean anything it is that's where your Treasures is your heart's going to be there too the thing that you're mostly concerned about he said don't take no thought uh uh what you what you wearing but I'm going tell you something folks are labeled they they they they spend all their money I just spend most of my check on what I'm doing where work hard over time and every time all kind of time just to dress to impress somebody say oh I like that you know what I'm saying but it's it's a time that where your treasure is that your heartbeat Treasures in Heaven I'm not worried about about this one right here this life here no more I'm not worried about amen whether I got on a a a a a $500 $1,000 suit wasn't my shoes cost so much whether I look like this or that whether my ring on my finger is so much money see folks are caught up in that kind of stuff amen Treasures in Heaven that's that that's what we thought about before you got saved but when you get saved that stuff don't mean nothing because why amen you're looking at the things which are above amen not on the things of the earth amen I don't know y'all all right amen Treasures in heaven let me look back here and see where your body or is more than REM the life is more than meat the 23rd verse and the body is more than remit consider the Ravens the 24th verse for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouses nor bars and God what feeded them God feeded them how much more are ye better than what the fouls fouls and which of you taking thought can add to his statue one one cubid and if ye then if you then be not able to do that that thing which is least why take ye thought for that for the rest amen now let me get where I want to go maybe he says let's just go to the 30th verse for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that you have need of these things but rather seek ye the what and all these things will what it says fear not little flock for it is your father what give you the kingdom you got to sell what you your way of thinking what you feel like what you caught up in you got to forget about all this stuff forget about this world because this world it's not here it's it's it's only here for a little while the life that you have that you live God's going to have you're going to have to give account for what you done with it the life that God gave you you're going to have to give a count what did you do with the life that he gave you oh I got some money and I got a nice house I got a nice car you can't take it to Heaven it'll never get to heaven I don't care what kind of house you got how much money you got in the bank somebody go spend it you're going to leave it here oh but I want to leave my children something oh praise God I told told my children on Father's Day He said dad what what you want I said y'all gave me more than what I could ever want for y'all to serve the Lord and me in the house of the Lord I said that mean more to me amen amen you could have went out and bought me a nice house a nice uh uh Mercedes or something but that wouldn't mean nothing to me amen if you're not serving the lord what did that mean amen amen you know all of you all y'all went to school got college degrees but that don't mean nothing if you're not serving the lord that means nothing are you with me amen I still be sad and down and our fathers they don't mean nothing to me are you with me but to see y'all serving the lord that means everything amen amen are you with me amen so the father going to look one day God's going to look he told a young man the the Bible said a young man want to away sorrowful when he said I want you to sell all you got that you can have Treasures in Heaven are you with me but the young man went away sorrow you think I'm going give it up and some folks have that mindset now you think I'm going to give it up no I'd rather have this for a little while than to have Treasures in Heaven amen because the question was uh what can I do to inherit eternal life I want eternal life but I'm not willing to give a this one up I I I want to have everything I can get now I want mine now and some people you know I I look at some of the you the people that call themselves successful maybe the pro vasal football players and all of them and all the you know uh Prince and Michael Jackson all man these people di trying to get a high you know what I'm saying they just wanted some peace wanted some happiness they wanted some relief so the people that the world look at Oho look at them they got money they got Fame they got this they got that and people Tre seek after it but Treasures in Heaven folks you mean to tell me you talking about something that I can't see you talking about something that I uh I I don't see that man the Jesus that you talk about the kingdom that you're talk about I can't see it so I don't want it because I don't see it people don't want a God that they can't see they want a God that they can see but the Bible say he that cometh to God must first of all believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that de seek him I said look to the Unseen amen because this world that you're looking at it will blind you amen amen amen I was looking at that in 2 Corinthians 4 this world that you see now it would blind you 2 Corinthians 4 and three it says if our gospel amen 2 Corinthians 4 and three uh you know but if our gospel be hid is what it h to them that are lost it said in whom the God of this world has blinded the mind of them that what believe not see he that cometh to God must first of all believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that deing to seek him but the God of this world will blind your mind amen he would keep you from see amen that invisible world that is more real than this world amen amen it's a kingdom amen Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world my kingdom was of this world and my servants would fight amen but my kingdom is not of this world am well we're talking about a kingdom that's what oh Hallelujah I'm telling you it's worth living because this these are Treasures that God's going to give you amen with raw moss and uh rust and all of the things the thief can't steal it from you you can't kill it the the enemy is a thief the Devil is a thief he come to kill to steal and destroy but Jesus said I come that you might have life and life more abundantly the devil will try to take your Joy from you try to take your peace from you but he can't have it no sir he can't have it and I'm not going to give it to him are you with me hallelujah it's a joy it's a peace that God gives you amen he said the Kingdom of Heaven is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost let me keep on on this amen Our Gospel be here is here to them that the laws whom the God of this world blinded the mind them to believe not least the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine into them isn't that right go ahead the next he said for we preach what not our not ourselves to Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for Jesus sake go ahead for God for the God who commanded the what Shine the Light to shine out of Darkness amen has shine in our hearts to give the

well I got a couple thousand in the bank I'm talking about money your treasure you know I got 401k and I I got $100,000 in 401K I'm tell you you buy a car you can't get no house with 100,000 now if you want a nice house you got to pay at least about 300 and something thousand 400,000 are you with me not unless you get a super deal right so we're talking about Treasures Treasures means the accumulation a store of wealth in the form of money precious metal or jewelry are you with me to Value greatly Treasures something that you value greatly are your charries I remember I was working for this millionaire and I was cleaning out a garage so I was just throwing and all of a sudden I came to some parts of a car and I I junk to me no don't do that why she treasured that it was one of those what back in the T Fords or something and they just had to put it back you can't throw these parts around the they were very valuable very expensive parts so sometimes people value certain things people value certain anti things people value things that are very pricey they valued and see what I'm saying but at the same time we're talking about Treasures in Heaven what your V what what your value what do you value more most of all what what what's most important to you you know is it this world and what you achieve some some people value you know and they think I've achieved so much that I'mma hold on to it but Jesus told I go s all all that you got and I'm saying to you again if you ever received the baptism with the Holy Ghost you had to surrender what you had to surrender all because God speaks to you I remember certain things I had to come to grips with you know I didn't have to get up off my knees and and go back and say I had to stop doing this and stop doing that had to give up this and that it just came to my heart when I was seeking the Lord for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I it just came to me you got to give up this and I know I had to be willing to say yes Lord you got to give up that yes Lord you got to give up everything yes because I wanted I Valu the Holy Ghost more than all of that and I wanted the Holy Ghost more than anything that I had and I know without the Holy Ghost I couldn't live right amen so I said I I I need the Holy Ghost more than anything because that's the only way I'm going to be able to live a Christian Life I need the Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen but sometime people just say well I just want to accept Christ and that that that their form of accepting Christ is just going through a ritual going through a formality but not really in their heart they really sold out that I want Christ in my heart because I need him in my life amen amen I said TR Treasures in Heaven amen Treasures in Heaven now in Hebrews I didn't get there Moses came to reality and you got to come to that place you got to come to this place here esteeming the reproach of Christ greater what greater riches than the what I don't know what what you're treading greater riches what do you what what what do you want in this life that if God was offering you eternal life that you didn't want to give up for eternal life I know what I know I know what's the problem is we don't believe that this is the word of God we don't believe that God is real we don't believe that God will do what he said he'll do if he said I give you Treasures in Heaven somebody said well I want it but we got folk that come to church that all they about is church we got folks that say I'm a Christian but all they're about is what they can get from God not what they can give to God Amen are you with me but it's God don't want what you got because he already got all he needs but God wants you to have what he greater riches amen amen he wants to give you something amen try just in heaven but in order to get it he said let this go amen let this world go let this life go Paul Moses I got a chance to be pharaoh I got a chance to rule the world I got a chance to

I looked at that I said that's hard that's a that's a hard saying but what why we want why you want to serve the Lord why why you don't you know God is calling you to serve him I'm not this ain't
