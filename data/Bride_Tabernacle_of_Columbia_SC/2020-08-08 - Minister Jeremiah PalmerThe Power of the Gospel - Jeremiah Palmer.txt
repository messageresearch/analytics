the name of jesus christ amen amen amen amen appreciate the lord amen have your bibles tonight if you turn with us to the book of saint luke it's good to be in the house of the lord amen really appreciate the lord jesus christ and saint luke the ninth chapter one through six and then romans one saint luke 9 1 through 6. then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them power in authority over all devils and to cue diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither styles nor script neither bread neither money neither have two coats of peace and well silver she enter into they abide and this depart and whosoever will not receive you when you go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere the book of romans the first chapter romans 1 and 16 paul here was saying i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god until salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek father bless your word tonight in jesus name amen amen may be seated i want to use for a little thought tonight as i was reading something this morning in uh as i was reading my little morning uh devotional and in the family alter book uh it came out with what paul here was saying in the book of romans 1 that i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god amen and as i looked at that and it did something to me and as i began to search it out in scriptures and things began to come to me and i began to look at the word i began to look at the disciples here that even before the holy ghost even was given to him in luke it says that then he called the disciples together and gave them power in authority god gave them something because of the gospel of jesus christ it has power in it and i believe if it had power then i believe it got power now but notice that the people has to have faith that what god gave them that it hasn't changed so many times we theological try to take that part of the scripture out and say that was only for back then but my god in hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is not was but is the same yesterday today and if it is then is doing it right now again let me read something book of hebrews i got a little stirred about it because i believe that the hebrews the fourth chapter i realized that we have heard great sermons and we've heard preaching of the word and god first commissioned that he gave the disciples in matthew 10 was to go ye out and heal the sick see god just didn't give him just the letter of the gospel but the word had something in it to do something and that gospel that they had and the gospel that we got it's the same gospel it's not another jesus that we are preaching but it's the same jesus we all the time like to say quote the scripture but i wonder sometimes do we really believe that he is the same can the word still produce the power that it did in the bible days well no we're not just living in a historical time that what god used to do and and what god used to can do no i'm living in a right now present tense yes so right now god god that is more than able to still heal the sick we are witnesses and we have testimonies that what god has done in our own very life that we can testify that i know he is a healer yes i know he is a provider i know he'll make a way when there isn't no way god does the impossible things that doctors can't even imagine and after they ran out of all of their resources god said don't worry about it my resources never runs out i'll make a way for you when when you can't even make a way for your own self that's the kind of god i'm talking about i'm talking about a supernatural god that does supernatural things oh yes there's no time now to just sit back and wonder uh whether he can do it no no no i believe he can do it amen the book of hebrews it says something here hebrews 4. four and two it says for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it amen in other words uh when you hear the gospel you've got to believe it by faith you've not only you act on what you hear because faith come by hearing and hearing come by the word but the bible says here that the word didn't profit them in other words they didn't really get the full benefit from it because it wasn't mixed with fancy and the bible said faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen see so faith the bible says it's impossible to please god without faith come on don't don't just get have a word just laying there and you don't apply faith to it amen i mean faith acts faith moves it moved because god said so not because of a certain preacher saying but god your word declared that you are more than able to do it and i'll believe it amen see it takes a odd person to to believe the word amen i want to go to another place here first corinthian oh my i'm telling you something i'm telling you if this word is not being activated uh in our own life i wonder sometime what word that you're listening to amen god word wants to do something amen it wants to root out amen those things amen that don't belong to you amen god wants to deliver you from every a habit and whatever the devil have been trying to hold you captive with come on god wants you to be loose but you get applied by faith first corinthians one oh my paul said here for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ shall be made of none effect 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god amen see it seems odd to preach the cross and to preach amen the thing that jesus and man had done but to us it is the power of god amen god not only he has it but god gave it to us he gave it to the church to do something with it not not just a word and paul said that uh i didn't come to you with excellent speech or men wisdom he said no no but he said but i come to you in demonstration and power of the holy ghost what kind of a church don't have no power in it i'll be the prophet of god say god hates a powerless church come on god want a church a man that knows what he wants done with the word amen you got to understand what is that in your hand oh and then you got to use it it'll do you no good to have something and it just well i i got the message and yet you ain't doing nothing with it come on the message if it's really if you really have it within you it'll cause you to react it'll cause you a man to begin to use what god gave you come on you got situations and you got conditions and and you ought to know what you got in your hands see you got beginners brother ernest was saying begin to let the world be getting inspired and you start speaking no time to cry now come on we don't cry long enough come on we don't been church long enough we didn't hurt preaching long enough come on let's use it now let's take these things that we've heard all these years now and let's get really beginning to move with it we don't want to be like they were that it didn't profit but we wanted to profit us so we want to mix it with faith and say lord here i am god let the word materialize in my life break these demon powers oh yeah even sisters you can lay hands on the sick oh yes that's the commission you don't have to be a preacher it's to the believers let's go there book of mark i i looked and i said you know in matthew 10 and in luke uh uh how that jesus gave them that authority and gave them the power to cast out devils before the holy ghost was even given and i began to say if they could had that kind of a authority meth mark 16 15 if they could have that kind of authority and power before uh the holy ghost came what kind of people we ought to be with the holy ghost see come on the holy ghost ain't weak god ain't never lost his power god just needs somebody to activate their faith begin to step out and say lord i believe your word oh no when are we going to get up about our father's business are we going to wait i believe we're in the hour now that these devils that been lurking around us and these devils of sickness and these devils of of frustration and depression and all of these demonic forces that coming against us and we just sitting there allowing these things come on no no no you got to get up out of that situation you got to fight your way out you got to understand that i'm not just some idiot church god no i am a son and a daughter of god i am who god say i am and i take authority over these demon powers devil lose him oh yeah you sit there and just play with it and i like i don't know what to do oh i understand so much going on come on what you crying for come on know that i said that brother and i said again it's time to speak it's the hour that we've got to begin to move out you know and and stop this uh uh abounding also being limited to our own circumstances come on you can have authority over that because i heard all pastors saying that but you know out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak it see what's in you is going to come out and that's why he's saying if my word abiding you amen and you about it then you can ask what the preacher will no no ask what you will see you've got to understand we've heard and we've read it and we have you know heard it like an old proverb but it got to still it got to do something on the inside of us i mean you just can't just sit let the word just lay there say well i know yeah that is what the bible said and that is what jesus said oh no you just don't want to be that kind of christian see that the word didn't profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith see faith don't look at symptoms faith don't look at how i feel because these five senses and what really paralyzes us we're living on in this outer rim and we should be living in the interim we should be a man in heavenly places and understand that no weapon form against you shall prosper he didn't say it won't come but he said it won't prosper so if it won't prosper then there's something that god has given us amen that we can come out of this situation how long do you want to stay in it oh brother shelly say lives ago when do you want these frogs to leave somebody said well maybe when the doctor give me the right medication and i can't get the right shot did i no no no no no come on god got a real shocked come on god got a pill hey man as i look on these uh uh hand sanitizers and they said it kills 99.9 but come on we got something that kills a hundred come on these demons of sickness come on god don't do 99.9 no he do a hundred percent god don't halfway deliver you but god gives you total deliverance oh yes i'm telling you uh i i don't know about you amen but but i feel we ought to be in revival mode not cooling off mode yeah i know we this country and what all is going on and the news and all of these report come on dumb report saying about me that that's not my report i got a good report i see it like no spy seven they came back in that land or they said oh there are giants and there are walls and and them other two sat there and said come on what y'all looking at they're saying we're more than able to take it yes there are walls yes there is cropper 19 yes there's arthritis yes there's high blood pressure but we are more than able yeah i i feel a little crazy but it feel good yeah because i know whom i believe come on i realize this church that if we don't get up out of this rut that the devil is trying to put on us we'll just wither right out and die oh no but not god's church come on they may even fall but they'll get back up come on you might be down today but you got to fight your way through as our brother and god will say press my way through and the servant of god said you ain't gonna get nothing except you fight for it every itch or ground you get you are not going to get in a victory crying about it stop our crying get about your father business look at your situation and say you devil in the name of jesus i take authority over you yeah see the devil know you when you're playing or not yeah but we sit there and say i don't know whether it'll happen oh my i believe now we have seen too much we've heard too much about what god can do now it's time for us to see god do it the problem is when do you want him to do it you want to wait another epidemic hit come on we we got to understand that this ain't nothing here we realize it's going to get even worse than this the world is panicking they're shook up there just uh going all out with all kind of lies and dramas and stories and philosophies and no real answers but here god got the answer god said i got the remedy god said i gave you the best weapon there is they can ever have that is the word you know thinking about you know the opening of the book you know but when the book was became open the power came with it come on that was the restoration of the word god said i was gonna i'm gonna restore and saith the lord and when he restored the truth of the word back to the believers it brought a power with it the same power that the early church had in the book of acts come on that church and the servant of god said we are the continuation of the early church of the book of acts church he said that acts church was a church that moved in power he said all else is false he said mark 16 let's read it let's go ahead and read it i know y'all know it sometimes i wonder as we read as things that we hear it so much but it has a clicked see the word has to be a quicken we need the holy ghost to quicken the word we need a revelation that's why the servant of god said revelation to the true church means more to you than what you think because if not we just have letter we have a lot of information that was stored up but what are we doing with it what is it doing in our lives the word oughta have preeminence the word is quick it's powerful it's sharp that a two-edged sword it's a discerner it goes down to the deep part of our thoughts it root out amen the powers of the devil is beholding us captivity and it sets us free oh my lord have mercy mark 16 servant of god said the last commission that god gave to the church 16 and 15 said he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel in other words to demonstrate it that's what we need not just a letter of it but we need the demonstration of it you know we witness the people about how good god is and what he's able to do and you uh sometimes even forget the television that my god can deliver out of every situation no no no there ain't no limit don't limit god to to to your standard take your limitation off of god and let god get loose let your faith loose and say god whatever that you doing in the season lord don't do it without me oh yeah but the enemy have us looking at what's going on in america oh how many cases they're going up and they're going up and they're going up but you failed to see how good god is you failed to see how god uh uh he didn't camp his angels about you come on god amen got his angel dispersed amen and won't let things go uh come to you and if he does allow it then god say i'm still the healer come on you might get sick but then you would know that god is still a healer yes he heals me god want to give you a testimony that where you can run and tell somebody there ain't nothing too hard for god to oh do that's why we don't have to panic and get all worried up you know about what's going on yes this thing is very deadly but come on god is our keeper god promised i'll keep you in the day of temptation i'll keep you in the darkness of the hours upon the earth i'll be your light come on when the whole world is going to gross darkness and and and earthquakes and storms and everything just seem to be coming from all over you know the place in in the economy is broke i mean there is such a turmoil that with money and how to get it back running again and we sitting here threatening about what that's why we got to understand the word didn't profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith i believe the bible said when the son of man cometh shall he find what faith on the earth see i believe paulden was saying that contend for the faith see this uh a church that god had called she's a church that's gonna uh walk and live by faith her faith is going to cause her to do exploits that's the church faith i saw something earlier peter but i'm not going to read that let me finish this here in mark it's like mark 16 fish reading it it said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe you know so many times even around the message they want to downplay that these things ought to be operating in our lab because they said that's pentecostal yeah pentecost it's pentecostals all right it's pentecostal experience god never took those things away from the church but because a lot of times that day don't i can't produce it or because it's not activating in their life then they say well we got the perfect word now so we don't need those things yes the word just brought uh us back to god and uh give us the understanding how to use these things correctly and to place it in order that these things ought to be operating not just in the preacher lives because it says here to him that what believeth how many believers we got if you are a believer then these things here are part of your promise it should be a part of your christian life not to wait to somebody else do it you do it see too many times we we're laying waiting on somebody else but activate your faith you know the more you begin to activate what you believe then god got something to work with oh my he said the 17 indeed signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall it cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they should take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord has spoken unto them he will receive up into heaven and set on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them income what confirming the word with signs following see god set them even out amen and god they went everywhere preaching the gospel and the law was confirming what he said see god confirmed the word because he the one gave it but they had to believe the word and they believed it and went out preaching it and god was working with them confirming the word and signs and one to follow them i wonder sometimes what's wrong with the church the bride's so-called say the the people that call themselves uh in the message yes plenty of them from plenty of letter oh plenty of good sermons plenty of deep mysteries plenty of uh tying in the loose ends and all of those things but where is the power of the word where is god confirming the word with signs and oneness come on because the word should have the same effect as it did back then it should be doing the same thing right now not just uh something we are saying and then nothing happens come on the word of god wants to move down in each and every one of our lives i'm going to read something i might already quoted it but let me just read it anyhow first thessalonians you know if god can just only get somebody brother keith said i wish somebody sold wood catch on fire amen that's what we need we need fire we need the dynamics not just the mechanics first that's going on one in five for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in what power and in the holy ghost any much as shown as you know what man of men we were among you and ye became followers of us and of the lord have received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost see paul said it came not in word only but in power and demonstration of the holy ghost servant of god said here when he sent his disciples out he told them healed the sick cleanse the leper raise the dead freely as we receive freely give he said that was his first commission matthew 10 in mark 16 last question he said go into all the world and preach the gospel he that believed in the baptist i already quoted that in my name he said what's the matter is we christians get too weak when it comes to the showdown when it comes to us applying what we've heard it when it comes time for us acting every on what we have heard then we begin to want to back down off of it when sickness come upon you or when something happens i mean even your home you got to understand that's the time for you to activate the word in your own life come on it'll do us no good it it'll be just like it was them it did not profit them not being mixed with faith faith activates the word because god said so that's why abraham uh could believe god like he did uh it said that abraham got stronger in faith don't tarry he wait for it he knew that it was impossible for god to tell a lie do it might tear it to you amen you got to understand that it got to happen because god said so that's the kind of church we ought to be that's the kind of people amen that we ought to be a people that's gonna not just uh are taken as a social a word but take it as as something that you know that what god's saying he's able to do it and he want to do it through you you are the one that the promises of god has been given to amen let's take god in his word tonight god bless you thank you jesus amen god is good appreciate the word today amen the power of the gospel the gospel has power to heal to deliver to set free we thank god for brother palmer the bible said the word didn't come with in word only but in power and demonstration and god is always identified by his own characteristics jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did then if he's jesus in you than what he was when he walked on the earth over 2 000 years ago that same jesus if he's in you he'll be identified by his own characteristics he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater works in these shall you do amen it's just whether or not we recognize who's in us and because we recognize who's in us then god is able to do the greater works but we have to allow him to do it because if we get in the way we interfere with what god is doing we don't want to interfere with the what the lord want to do in our lives because we realize we can do nothing he said without me you can do nothing so it takes god doing the work amen the bible says we are his workmanship created in christ jesus so it's him that worketh in us both the will and to do of his good pleasure it's not what we can do it's what god is doing amen so as we can get ourselves out the way we can allow the spirit of god to achieve and accomplish what god has promised in his word to do in this day and how we live in so we can look to the promises of god and say god you promise amen and you hold god to his promise you say god this is what you promised and we know that god cannot lie and all we got to do is stand on the promises of god and knowing that the promises that god has come to pass we got to have patient enough to wait and trust god to bring it to pass in our lives if he said with the stripes we heal amen then god don't go back on his word but god gave us his word if he tells you with his stripes you're healed then we got to stand on the promises of god and say god you said it lord and you keep your word i know i can depend on god's word and we can't depend on god's word what word we're going to depend on who amen if we can't trust what god said and his word said who we're going to depend on who we're going to trust in amen so what happens what we we that believe god's word we act on god's word that's why we're here tonight he said when two or three are gathered in my name he said forsake not disassembling yourself together isn't that right so we're acting on what god's word said now we got to know amen whatever we can do for the lord time is short and the time is at hand they meant when god reckoned with you in that day
