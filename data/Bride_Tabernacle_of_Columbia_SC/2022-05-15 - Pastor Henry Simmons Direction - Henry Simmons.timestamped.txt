[42:26] you toward you may be seated
[42:29] praise god
[42:31] if you ever needed to trust the lord
[42:34] the hour is now
[42:38] praise god
[42:41] trust the lord
[42:43] and leading
[42:44] not to thy own understanding
[42:48] amen god's servant spoke a message on
[42:51] lean not that i want understanding
[42:55] and today we want
[42:57] to talk to you
[42:58] concerning direction
[43:04] we need direction
[43:05] [Music]
[43:07] we need guidance
[43:10] direction
[43:11] when we speak of direction
[43:14] what are you really saying
[43:17] instructions on how to get someplace
[43:23] we need instructions of how to get some
[43:26] place
[43:32] how to do something
[43:35] most
[43:36] the things you order now
[43:39] they come in a box
[43:41] and they give you direction how to put
[43:43] your table together how to put this
[43:45] together
[43:46] so you have to put it together
[43:49] but you need directions
[43:52] sometimes it has 50 75 parts
[43:56] you know it looks pretty
[43:59] on the picture
[44:00] but when they send it to you in the box
[44:02] [Music]
[44:04] it's all in pieces
[44:07] praise god
[44:08] and we need direction
[44:10] sometimes uh our lives look like it's
[44:13] all in pieces it's like a puzzle we got
[44:16] to put it together
[44:19] and sometimes we're left with
[44:24] some folks have no directions
[44:30] sometimes we're put on a path
[44:33] and sometimes nobody really puts us on a
[44:36] path sometimes parents
[44:38] just have children
[44:40] they just have them
[44:42] and they don't put them on a pathway
[44:46] they just
[44:47] whatever or
[44:49] life dictates they just
[44:51] go with the wind
[44:53] go with the flow
[44:55] [Music]
[44:56] but their other says well i want my
[44:58] child to be
[44:59] a tennis player i want my child to be a
[45:01] football player i want my child to be a
[45:04] golf
[45:05] i want to tiger woods i want to serena
[45:08] williams i'm on a
[45:10] lebron james and they'll put them on
[45:12] that path
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] and
[45:17] the child has nothing to do with it they
[45:19] just on that path and ah sometimes
[45:22] they're usually
[45:24] very successful on that path
[45:26] and sometimes folks are put on a course
[45:29] and pointed in a direction that they
[45:31] don't want to go
[45:33] and they find out when by the time they
[45:36] they're struggling they're battling and
[45:38] parents sometimes push them and
[45:42] and then they
[45:43] tall with them because they're trying to
[45:46] point them in a direction that
[45:48] they just don't want to go
[45:51] are you with me
[45:53] and a lot of times in those directions
[45:56] that we push and pump
[45:58] ah them push them when they get there
[46:00] they just sometimes they get
[46:03] to the pinnacle of whatever you wanted
[46:05] them to be and they find out this is not
[46:07] what i wanted to be this is what mama
[46:09] wanted me to be this is what daddy
[46:11] wanted me to be and i don't want to be
[46:14] there
[46:17] and sometimes it's later on in life
[46:20] when we spend all our effort all our
[46:22] time
[46:24] and
[46:25] money and everything
[46:27] the point
[46:28] one in a direction that they don't feel
[46:31] led to go in
[46:35] life is like that we can make
[46:38] some
[46:38] investments that
[46:41] we make
[46:43] and those investments that we invest in
[46:47] and the time that we invest in certain
[46:49] things
[46:50] we wish sometimes that we could take
[46:52] back our investment
[46:55] because it did not draw any dividend
[46:59] matter of fact it was a waste of time
[47:03] so sometimes we invest and we uh point
[47:07] in directions
[47:09] now it's another thing
[47:12] about directions
[47:14] it's the point to watch something
[47:18] you know it's the point towards
[47:19] something
[47:21] and i'm gonna tell you
[47:22] the quicker now how do i find what
[47:25] direction
[47:26] uh
[47:27] my life is to go in how do i find it
[47:31] because i i believe it some folks are
[47:34] 50 60 years old
[47:38] and their lives are like going with the
[47:39] wind
[47:41] they're tossed to and fro
[47:43] they haven't found themselves so how can
[47:46] they direct their children
[47:49] are you with me
[47:51] have become grandparents and they don't
[47:53] know where they know and they just
[47:55] go with the flow whatever life
[47:57] you know
[47:59] but it's good to have
[48:01] somebody that's anchored
[48:06] it's good to have somebody to help
[48:08] that's deep rooted
[48:12] that the winds when they blow they
[48:14] cannot toss you away from
[48:17] amen because you know
[48:19] amen what you're in the earth for
[48:23] sometimes that is a natural cause
[48:26] and also there's a spiritual cause
[48:31] we start in grammar school
[48:34] oftentimes said rachel knew
[48:37] that she wanted to be a teacher
[48:40] as far as i can remember
[48:43] almost
[48:44] three four years old
[48:46] she wanted to be a teacher
[48:49] that's all i mean that was her goal
[48:53] and then she had a cousin that
[48:56] was going through some things and
[48:59] one time she says i wanted to work with
[49:00] the deaf and the dumb
[49:03] and
[49:04] and then she
[49:05] i said well rachel you know
[49:08] why don't you just try
[49:10] special education because there are more
[49:12] colleges often than that
[49:14] and there's only a few often
[49:17] and so i said why don't you do that and
[49:19] then you can gravitate over there
[49:21] if you wanted but you it's still in the
[49:24] teaching profession
[49:26] and so by the grace of god
[49:28] sometimes
[49:30] there are others that
[49:33] what you want to be caleb made up in
[49:35] mind
[49:36] i think one of the
[49:38] working with the orchestra one of the
[49:40] teachers on the officer said why don't
[49:42] you go in the map son
[49:45] and he says oh
[49:47] sound good to me
[49:50] and so he went to man
[49:54] they wrote joshua from a lot of
[49:56] different colleges and all of a sudden
[49:59] usc wrote him come to business
[50:02] dollar more school of business
[50:04] come down there
[50:06] so
[50:06] he says okay
[50:08] he went down for summer camp and all he
[50:11] said i want to be a business
[50:14] i want to go to dollar more school of
[50:15] business
[50:16] so
[50:17] out of all the choices
[50:19] you made a decision
[50:21] to go to dollar more
[50:24] and uh
[50:25] your children are faced with situations
[50:28] some of don't know where they wanted
[50:30] what they want to do and there's others
[50:34] like rachel they know
[50:36] and there are others that undecided
[50:39] come late but hopefully it'll come
[50:42] because if it don't come
[50:44] that you know it's life is
[50:47] it's very chaotic when you have no
[50:49] direction
[50:51] it's very
[50:52] confusing when you have no direction
[50:56] some folks have changed from one job to
[50:59] another job from one thing to is the
[51:02] when you find you know i often times
[51:05] in passion
[51:07] for almost 50 years
[51:09] i
[51:10] oftentimes i
[51:11] was teach the young people sunday school
[51:14] and i'll try to find out
[51:16] you know where you want to go what you
[51:18] want to be what you want to do
[51:20] you know because the sooner you find out
[51:23] you can start working towards that goal
[51:26] but if you still trouble in them
[51:29] i don't know
[51:30] oh no
[51:31] and when they get around 17 18 they're
[51:34] still saying um
[51:36] oh god that's difficult because you
[51:39] could have built
[51:41] an elementary school
[51:44] and junior high school
[51:46] and you could have advanced you could be
[51:48] advanced but when you did not build
[51:53] it's difficult
[51:56] if you don't set certain goals and try
[51:58] to reach those particular goals
[52:02] it's difficult now
[52:04] what it does
[52:07] it causes you
[52:09] to be
[52:10] one that's
[52:12] unsuccessful
[52:15] in life
[52:17] you struggle with life
[52:21] because you did not make a decision soon
[52:24] enough
[52:26] and because you're not making a decision
[52:28] soon enough you may have a child
[52:32] and you may marry early or whatever
[52:36] but if you have an
[52:37] uncertainty about your life
[52:40] then all of a sudden you're raising
[52:42] children in uncertainty
[52:46] because they don't have
[52:48] because you don't have it
[52:51] so a lot of times i find those to
[52:54] work hard
[52:56] i mean they go to work every day hating
[52:59] it
[53:00] it's not something that they enjoy doing
[53:03] they don't love what they're doing
[53:06] and then there are some that
[53:08] enjoy the job
[53:11] but they're on the lowest totem pole
[53:14] and they just valley
[53:16] can
[53:17] get food on the table and paid iran
[53:23] you see what i'm saying it's because why
[53:28] you know the bible said godliness
[53:31] with contentment is great gain
[53:34] but you'll find that many people are not
[53:36] contented
[53:38] neither do they have god
[53:41] are you with me
[53:43] but when you got god
[53:46] and you're contented
[53:48] it doesn't matter if you just making
[53:51] ends meet
[53:52] god takes care of you day by day
[53:55] as long as you're happy
[53:57] and you got god
[53:59] are you what man
[54:01] direction
[54:03] which direction are you headed okay
[54:07] i was in prayer this morning and i was
[54:09] talking about direction and i said you
[54:11] know i was going to hold down a
[54:13] different direction in mullins i was
[54:15] talking about your inheritance and so
[54:16] forth on thursday night and i thought oh
[54:19] boy we was excited down to mullins and
[54:21] we had a wonderful time and i was i mean
[54:24] people shouting and we were shouting
[54:27] you know i was short you know but i
[54:28] thought
[54:29] you know i believe i shared with
[54:31] columbia amen
[54:32] but when i got here this morning and
[54:35] got out on my knees and started praying
[54:37] to god and
[54:38] it's just direction
[54:40] you know because i wanted what god
[54:42] wanted me to speak to you all about
[54:45] direction
[54:47] and i said huh
[54:49] and then
[54:52] which way is your life pointing
[54:56] is it up or is it down is it left or is
[54:59] it right
[55:02] so your life is pointing in a certain
[55:05] direction
[55:08] okay when i speak about pointing in a
[55:10] certain direction
[55:13] is your life taking you towards
[55:16] heaven
[55:18] or is your life taking you towards
[55:21] hell
[55:23] are you with me
[55:25] is it taking you up or is it taking you
[55:27] down
[55:31] are you with me
[55:33] left
[55:34] the goats on the left the sheep is on
[55:36] the right
[55:38] are you with me
[55:39] is it taking your left or taking your
[55:41] right
[55:44] are you going in the right direction or
[55:45] you're going in
[55:48] are you with me
[55:49] are you going into what
[55:51] wrong direction i don't think about it
[55:54] what
[55:54] what direction are you headed
[55:58] which direction are you going
[56:02] okay
[56:04] which direction
[56:06] do you want to go in
[56:10] are you up there
[56:12] which direction do you
[56:14] as an individual want to go in
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] you know what
[56:21] i have about
[56:22] five to ten percent
[56:24] of the people in here this morning
[56:26] especially young people
[56:29] you know what they're saying
[56:32] to me
[56:33] leave me alone
[56:38] leave me alone
[56:40] in other words i don't want to hear it
[56:46] we're trying to tell you something to
[56:48] help you but they said
[56:50] just leave me alone
[56:53] have you heard that before parents leave
[56:55] me alone
[56:58] you're trying to help them to make
[57:00] decisions and they're going the right
[57:02] path and they just saying leave me alone
[57:06] but one day they wish they would have
[57:08] given you the opportunity to hear what
[57:11] you had to say
[57:13] are you a man
[57:15] it's not leave me alone can you help me
[57:17] mama
[57:18] can you help me daddy
[57:21] when you're reaching out for help
[57:26] then mama said leave me alone
[57:30] daddy said leave me alone
[57:33] grandma i'm gonna leave leave me alone
[57:37] now you need help
[57:41] you don't want to hear them say leave me
[57:42] alone
[57:44] because you were
[57:47] hard-headed
[57:49] and you didn't want to listen
[57:53] and now you're in a condition where you
[57:55] need help
[58:00] and sometimes you know what what
[58:04] the older people used to say and i'm old
[58:06] now
[58:07] if you make your bed hard what
[58:11] lay in it
[58:13] are you with me
[58:15] so some people make their bed hard
[58:18] and they want you to soften it up for
[58:22] are you a man
[58:24] they they they they
[58:26] they point them lives in a situation in
[58:29] a way that they're gonna have a hard
[58:31] time
[58:34] they're gonna have a hard life
[58:38] because they made no preparation
[58:42] for the future
[58:45] you must be pointed in a direction that
[58:49] your future could be better
[58:53] than others that are surrounding you
[58:57] you can have a better future a better
[58:59] life
[59:03] i know all parents want their children
[59:06] to have better than what they had
[59:10] not saying our lives were bad but we
[59:13] want our children to have a better life
[59:15] than we
[59:17] you always want them to excel you
[59:20] they have more than what you ever had
[59:23] because you want to give them all you
[59:25] got
[59:26] amen to make them better
[59:30] amen
[59:31] so by the grace of god as we look at
[59:33] that
[59:35] i want to um focus our attention a
[59:37] little bit on um first chronicles 28
[59:42] first chronicles 28.
[59:45] god is good amen
[59:48] we'll
[59:49] it won't be long and i i thought about
[59:52] when the lord was dealing with this is
[59:54] around graduation time and
[59:57] you know
[59:58] some are graduating from college some
[1:00:00] are graduating from high school and some
[1:00:02] are going from uh
[1:00:04] uh elementary to middle school and some
[1:00:07] are
[1:00:07] going from middle school to high school
[1:00:09] and they have different things that
[1:00:11] they're going through
[1:00:13] and i want to say
[1:00:14] value where you are
[1:00:18] and do
[1:00:20] the best
[1:00:22] that you can you know
[1:00:24] sometimes in school i was just
[1:00:27] you know my focus is more on sports than
[1:00:30] on the books
[1:00:32] you know what i'm saying
[1:00:33] and a lot of times
[1:00:36] you know
[1:00:36] we we need to focus in on
[1:00:39] you know let's apply ourselves because
[1:00:42] you know it's not many that's going to
[1:00:44] make it the sports wise
[1:00:49] like they said education to take your
[1:00:51] long ways
[1:00:53] okay so you it'll take you a long way in
[1:00:55] this life
[1:00:57] and we want you to you know to focus in
[1:01:00] and get the help and the tutoring and
[1:01:02] whatever you need
[1:01:04] to be what where you want to go
[1:01:07] because if you don't know where you want
[1:01:08] to go you're not going to get no help
[1:01:11] if you don't care about your what you
[1:01:14] eating up
[1:01:16] see if you don't care about what you end
[1:01:18] up but when you end up you may not want
[1:01:20] to be there
[1:01:22] amen if if you're 25 and
[1:01:26] and you're still home with mama
[1:01:28] come on i know my son's still home
[1:01:30] [Laughter]
[1:01:33] but you
[1:01:34] you you know what i'm saying
[1:01:37] but
[1:01:38] don't have to be you know what i'm
[1:01:40] saying when you in a place where you got
[1:01:42] to be there
[1:01:44] are you a man
[1:01:46] so it is it's a thing you're in a place
[1:01:50] where you've got to but you're in a
[1:01:51] place where you don't have to be but
[1:01:53] you're just waiting on things to you
[1:01:54] know try to get some things together
[1:01:57] that's all right but here we were in a
[1:01:59] place where you can't help yourself
[1:02:04] are you up man
[1:02:05] i'm talking about direction
[1:02:08] i'm talking about you have left with the
[1:02:10] situations in life where you cannot
[1:02:14] progress
[1:02:16] because you have been
[1:02:18] ah goodness rachel i don't know how to
[1:02:21] put it in words you tell me don't say
[1:02:23] certain things
[1:02:26] see so you can't say certain things
[1:02:28] daddy that's not professional
[1:02:31] you're not handicapped
[1:02:33] maybe
[1:02:34] but you put yourself where you you made
[1:02:37] yourself
[1:02:39] you know
[1:02:40] ah
[1:02:41] i hope that'll pass
[1:02:43] okay
[1:02:45] you you because you can put yourself in
[1:02:47] a a way that
[1:02:50] you're going to hurt your own self
[1:02:54] she got to teach me some more you know
[1:02:57] because i you know i'm trying to do my
[1:02:59] best
[1:03:01] but by the grace of god
[1:03:03] you can put your life in a situation
[1:03:06] that you've already started your own
[1:03:10] growth
[1:03:11] your own development
[1:03:13] you made yourself a
[1:03:15] victim of circumstances that you cannot
[1:03:19] be developed
[1:03:21] because you don't have the tools anymore
[1:03:24] at your disposal
[1:03:27] when you had the tools and it was
[1:03:30] available to you you made no use of
[1:03:33] those tools
[1:03:35] now you've gotten on the road and you
[1:03:41] want to be developed but you waited
[1:03:45] too late
[1:03:48] oh you hooked me
[1:03:50] so now you're trying to hey i'm gonna do
[1:03:53] you're not
[1:03:54] come on
[1:03:56] it's just like i've i find many times on
[1:03:59] music teachers
[1:04:00] when adults come in and they're about 50
[1:04:03] years old 60. i want to learn how to
[1:04:05] play the piano
[1:04:06] most of the teachers look at and say
[1:04:11] they they don't believe you really
[1:04:13] serious
[1:04:15] but there are some that
[1:04:16] you know they're really serious
[1:04:19] and i know this the teachers
[1:04:22] they don't want to they don't want to be
[1:04:24] bothered
[1:04:26] and that's that sometimes in life we try
[1:04:29] to
[1:04:30] somebody says well you can go to college
[1:04:32] free
[1:04:33] you know when you get a certain age i
[1:04:35] don't know but anyway a lot of things
[1:04:38] pass you by
[1:04:40] opportunities pass you by when you're
[1:04:43] young you're strong and you can think
[1:04:45] good amen now you you're not as keen and
[1:04:49] thinking you don't have the strength in
[1:04:51] the willpower that you used to have
[1:04:53] because you've gotten older
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] so brother and sister i'm saying to you
[1:05:01] as young people take advantage of the
[1:05:03] opportunity that god has given you
[1:05:09] let me see what solomon here says
[1:05:12] uh ii chronicles 28-5 he said david
[1:05:18] and a sodom assembly gives counsel to
[1:05:21] israel
[1:05:22] and the solemn
[1:05:25] david giving counsel to israel and the
[1:05:28] solomons
[1:05:30] in the 5th verse
[1:05:31] 1st chronicles
[1:05:33] 28 and 5. and he says
[1:05:38] and all
[1:05:39] and of all my
[1:05:41] my sons
[1:05:44] for the lord has given me
[1:05:46] many what
[1:05:48] many sons i'm gonna tell you something
[1:05:50] it may be many many christians and many
[1:05:54] folks that say i'm saved
[1:05:58] the lord has given me many sons
[1:06:01] i'm gonna tell you the reason why you're
[1:06:03] called the bride of jesus christ because
[1:06:05] you are elect and you are chosen
[1:06:09] are you with me
[1:06:12] god has purposely
[1:06:14] by the message of monocot 4 call you out
[1:06:19] as he did david did solomon
[1:06:23] so god
[1:06:25] threw
[1:06:26] the seven angel
[1:06:28] messages called you out
[1:06:33] and he made
[1:06:34] note that you have been chosen
[1:06:38] out of all my sons david said
[1:06:42] and that's what god said out of all
[1:06:44] those christians god chose you to be his
[1:06:46] wife the bride
[1:06:50] are you with me
[1:06:51] he chose you to be the bride
[1:06:54] you could chose somebody else but he
[1:06:56] chose you
[1:06:57] you're special you are the bride
[1:07:01] if he wanted a wife he saw you and he
[1:07:03] made his decision
[1:07:05] i want you to be my bride
[1:07:08] are you with me
[1:07:11] so he
[1:07:12] says
[1:07:14] give me many sons
[1:07:16] he has chosen what
[1:07:19] he's chosen solomon
[1:07:21] he has chosen solomon
[1:07:24] brothers and sisters don't don't try to
[1:07:26] be like the rest of them
[1:07:28] you know israel wanted to be like the
[1:07:30] rest of the nations
[1:07:31] don't try to be like the rest of the
[1:07:33] people that call themselves chris god
[1:07:35] has made you special you know i don't
[1:07:36] want you to be like the rest of the
[1:07:38] nations
[1:07:40] denominations you with me
[1:07:43] because i call you as he said israel and
[1:07:47] solomon

[1:07:54] i made you for this hour i've chosen you
[1:07:57] out

[1:08:05] mystery babylon god chose you to come
[1:08:07] out

[1:08:12] separate saith the lord
[1:08:14] are you with me god calls for
[1:08:17] separation
[1:08:19] god calls you to be separate
[1:08:23] special
[1:08:24] are you with me
[1:08:26] well god did not want israel to be a
[1:08:29] part of those nations

[1:08:34] people

[1:08:59] so he says

[1:20:06] he said they imagined every imagination
[1:20:08] and thought a man's heart was
[1:20:10] continually evil
[1:20:12] and as a man thinking then it's hard so
[1:20:14] is he
[1:20:16] are you with me i'm gonna tell you guys
[1:20:20] oh god now he's talking about a perfect
[1:20:22] heart and he didn't talk about a foolish
[1:20:24] heart but a perfect heart

[1:20:32] understanding
[1:20:34] oh god it's good
[1:20:36] imagination
[1:20:38] he knows our imagination and the
[1:20:40] thoughts
[1:20:41] and the tense of the heart he knows us
[1:20:43] the word of god can discern that
[1:20:45] if thou seek him you see what i'm saying
[1:20:48] if you what
[1:20:50] that's what i'm saying we got to take
[1:20:52] time out
[1:20:53] while you're pointing people in
[1:20:54] direction and your children and god no
[1:20:56] no take time to seek god's advice
[1:21:01] seek counsel from god
[1:21:04] talk it over with jesus
[1:21:07] jesus is just your will and his mind
[1:21:11] am i dreaming my dreams through my
[1:21:13] children
[1:21:16] what i wanted to be i want my children
[1:21:18] to be that for me because i did not
[1:21:20] achieve it
[1:21:23] are you up man
[1:21:27] don't let your children fulfill your
[1:21:29] dreams
[1:21:31] are you with me
[1:21:34] but you want god's perfect will for
[1:21:36] their lives
[1:21:38] do you want what's best for them or
[1:21:40] what's best for you
[1:21:43] are you a man
[1:21:46] see sometimes we struggle we want to
[1:21:48] point our children in a direction and
[1:21:50] they don't want to go to that direction
[1:21:52] and so they struggle
[1:21:54] they're trying to be what you want them
[1:21:56] to be and not what god intended for them
[1:21:59] to be from the beginning
[1:22:02] and sometimes the fight against you
[1:22:05] and to resist you
[1:22:07] sometimes the devil take them on a
[1:22:09] terrible spin through life
[1:22:13] the devil take them through some chaotic
[1:22:15] things
[1:22:16] because they're rebelling against you
[1:22:20] why because you
[1:22:22] wanted them to be something that they
[1:22:24] wasn't certain or sure of
[1:22:26] instead of being patient and praying
[1:22:29] god direct me
[1:22:32] that i can give them a thing
[1:22:34] point them in a direction that they
[1:22:36] could flow
[1:22:38] you know when they flowing
[1:22:40] and everything is just going peaceful
[1:22:42] and flowing
[1:22:43] amen you got them in the right path
[1:22:46] the right pathway amen
[1:22:49] but when they're struggling and battling
[1:22:50] and fighting and
[1:22:52] huh trying to get it and can't get it
[1:22:54] and you're still pushing them pushing
[1:22:56] you can do it
[1:23:00] take it easy it's gonna come to a
[1:23:02] breaking point sometimes
[1:23:04] and sometimes
[1:23:06] those breaking points
[1:23:08] and sometimes they come to a point and
[1:23:10] they just
[1:23:11] flat-out rebel
[1:23:13] because they got to the breaking point
[1:23:14] you broke them down
[1:23:17] and they couldn't take it no more are
[1:23:20] you with me
[1:23:21] so i'm saying don't push him to a
[1:23:23] breaking point
[1:23:25] pray
[1:23:27] get with god
[1:23:29] talk it over with jesus
[1:23:31] are you with me
[1:23:34] if i seek him
[1:23:37] he will will be found of thee
[1:23:41] are you with me
[1:23:43] but if thou forsake him
[1:23:46] are you with me but if god forsake him
[1:23:50] he will what
[1:23:52] he will cast thee all forever
[1:23:56] take heed now he says
[1:23:59] for the lord has what
[1:24:03] what the lord has chosen thee
[1:24:06] to build and house for
[1:24:09] the sanctuary be strong and what
[1:24:13] be strong and do it are you with me
[1:24:18] god has chosen you you
[1:24:21] to those that have an ear to hear
[1:24:23] god chose you
[1:24:25] to build his house
[1:24:27] amen those that have an ear to hear
[1:24:30] hear what the spirit says to you as an
[1:24:32] individual
[1:24:34] if he didn't say anything to you then he
[1:24:35] wasn't talking to you
[1:24:37] but if he did
[1:24:39] then you must be special to him
[1:24:42] are you with me
[1:24:44] now whether we listen to him today
