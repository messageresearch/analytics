[36:57] of god
[36:59] i mean the lord allow us to see another
[37:01] day
[37:02] amen and it's a reason for us being here
[37:06] amen we um
[37:09] our hearts and our prayers go out to our
[37:11] precious brother
[37:13] uh i know here within the last
[37:17] few years you all have experienced you
[37:20] know
[37:20] some loss it's not just you but you know
[37:23] all over
[37:24] you know though it's just the timing of
[37:26] god is ticking around
[37:29] you know when i was much younger you
[37:31] know i didn't experience
[37:33] many deaths that were right around me
[37:35] like within my own family and
[37:37] things of that nature you know
[37:39] especially when you're young you just
[37:40] kind of
[37:41] your mind is it's like people are going
[37:43] to live on forever you don't think about
[37:45] death but then as time went on
[37:47] you know my uncles and my aunts and you
[37:50] know my grandmother and everybody just
[37:52] started fading off the scene
[37:54] you know when i realized the older i get
[37:57] the more of that i see
[37:59] it's just it's just the timing of life
[38:02] you know you know the way that god has
[38:04] his appointment said
[38:06] amen it's just the timing that just
[38:08] takes place but
[38:09] uh that was a a wonderful homegoing
[38:11] service on yesterday and i thought it
[38:13] was real timely
[38:15] and a blessing just how brother simmons
[38:19] was expressing in the beginning
[38:21] you know how he had desired for the
[38:22] family to be able to hear her last
[38:24] testimony and a word
[38:26] in a song and they wasn't able to get it
[38:29] quiet together and what have you and his
[38:31] you know to to to him not knowing as
[38:34] soon as he finished ministering
[38:36] they were able to put it on and i felt
[38:38] like that was just
[38:39] a right placing for that you know seeds
[38:42] were being planted
[38:44] how many believe that amen and
[38:47] we don't know you know god is the
[38:49] gardener
[38:51] isn't that right he's the one that tends
[38:53] after his seeds
[38:55] so wherever he plants it a man he takes
[38:57] care of the ground and he
[38:59] he makes sure that it brings forth he
[39:01] brings forth the increase so we just
[39:03] keep everyone that was here in prayer
[39:06] uh and and just believing that that god
[39:08] is going to have his way and and you
[39:10] never know what's going to come out of
[39:12] that
[39:13] amen but god knows you know we thank god
[39:16] for brother simmons i know he's not here
[39:19] um with everything that's been going on
[39:23] uh you know uh fellowship hadn't been
[39:25] able to take place as often i believe is
[39:27] in our
[39:28] hearts we would desire for it to be but
[39:31] i know here a few weeks ago
[39:33] i think he and brother ernest was riding
[39:36] together and they stopped by my house
[39:38] when i wasn't there and they told my son
[39:39] to ask me to get in contact with him
[39:42] and so i just went ahead and stopped by
[39:44] his house i hadn't been over there in so
[39:46] long
[39:47] and then we stay right around the corner
[39:49] for one another
[39:50] but i i just be gone
[39:54] work church family and then traveling as
[39:57] much as i've been traveling lately so it
[39:59] was good to be able just to sit
[40:01] and fellowship with him for a while amen
[40:04] and uh
[40:04] and so we're here now by the grace of
[40:07] god and
[40:08] i just believe god has times and seasons
[40:10] for everything
[40:13] you understand what i'm saying you know
[40:15] whenever god brings ministries through
[40:18] i i don't want it i don't i don't want
[40:21] to believe it's just by the
[40:23] ordaining of man and the appointments of
[40:25] man
[40:26] i believe is it's god that knows when to
[40:29] bring
[40:30] what's needed in the right seasons
[40:33] and so i don't know how long it's been
[40:35] since i've been in
[40:38] i just know that god got seasons so we
[40:41] just pray his will be done this morning
[40:43] it's good to see everyone that's here uh
[40:45] some new faces
[40:46] you know a lot of familiar faces uh
[40:49] seeing the young people growing on up
[40:51] man
[40:52] i see it in my own family you know my

[43:17] their husband their god

[43:37] as it says in your word lord is
[43:40] is precious to you lord god the taking
[43:42] home of your saints

[43:47] joined with you lord and she's in a
[43:48] better place than us right now

[43:54] was looking for healing
[43:56] father she's received her ultimate
[43:58] healing lord
[43:59] [Music]
[44:02] father she wouldn't come back here if
[44:03] she had to
[44:06] our prophet lord god his wife was
[44:09] brought back temporarily lord and she
[44:11] questioned why it was that she was asked
[44:13] to come back

[44:53] part of your service we just pray that
[44:54] you would help us
[44:56] help your people father god have your
[44:59] way we ask
[44:59] in the name of our lord and savior jesus
[45:02] christ we pray
[45:03] amen amen
[45:06] you know our bible saying let's turn to
[45:08] uh
[45:16] we thank god for the musicians it did a
[45:19] great job and even in yesterday how the
[45:21] lord used them to be able to
[45:24] to just use their gifts to give glory to
[45:26] him and and the comfort to the family
[45:28] you know at that time it was real real
[45:30] good
[45:32] i used to play the violin
[45:37] you wouldn't never guess that
[45:40] i played for a few years
[45:43] and i don't remember nothing about it
[45:45] now i was in middle school
[45:48] and i enjoyed it then but i got away
[45:50] from it and i just forgot everything
[45:52] so the lord knows amen all right let's
[45:55] go to the book of james saints chapter
[45:57] 3.
[45:59] thank god for brother ernest and his
[46:01] wife he mentioned to me that they having
[46:03] their anniversary
[46:05] amen may the lord continue to bless them
[46:08] in every family
[46:09] and every couple james chapter 3
[46:13] starting at verse 1.
[46:18] it says my brethren be not many masters
[46:20] knowing that we shall receive the
[46:22] greater condemnation
[46:24] for in many things we offend all
[46:28] and i don't want to read over this too
[46:29] quickly saints let's just
[46:31] really think about what's being said
[46:33] here because god is communicating
[46:35] something very important
[46:37] he says for many things we offend all
[46:41] if any man offend not in word
[46:44] notice he says the same is a perfect man
[46:50] so of any man offend not in word
[46:53] the same is a perfect man
[46:57] and able also to bridle the whole body
[47:02] so now he's taking the bridling of the
[47:04] tongue
[47:06] meaning your speech being controlled
[47:09] right and he's linking it to something
[47:14] he's showing he's kind of pointing us to
[47:16] something a little deeper
[47:19] so even though he's talking about the
[47:20] broader length of the tongue there's
[47:22] something else that's deeper that he's
[47:24] really pointing to
[47:26] because now he's saying if that tongue
[47:27] can be bridled
[47:29] that same person he said is a perfect
[47:31] man
[47:32] and is able to bridle the whole body
[47:37] meaning all of his actions and his
[47:40] thoughts are controlled
[47:44] he says behold also the ships
[47:49] i'm sorry verse three behold we put bits
[47:52] in the horse's mouth
[47:53] he says that they may obey us and we
[47:56] turn about their whole
[47:57] body that's true right
[48:01] it's big and you know some some horses
[48:03] weigh tons
[48:06] and a little bit in that horse's mouth
[48:10] and you can turn this whole body amen
[48:15] he says that they may obey us and we
[48:17] turn about their whole body behold
[48:19] also the ships which though they be so
[48:22] great
[48:23] and are driven of fierce winds yet are
[48:26] they
[48:27] turned about with a very small hand
[48:31] wither so ever the governor the governor
[48:33] listed he says
[48:34] even so the tongue is a little member
[48:37] and boasts of great things
[48:39] behold how great a matter a little fire
[48:42] kindleth
[48:43] notice how he says this saints and the
[48:45] tongue is a fire a world of iniquity
[48:49] he says so is the tongue among our
[48:51] members that it defileth the whole body
[48:56] and setteth on fire the course of nature
[49:00] and it is set on fire of hell
[49:05] so he's saying that
[49:09] the tongue he says can be set on fire of
[49:13] hell
[49:14] what does that mean saints meaning the
[49:16] inspiration and the anointing of demon
[49:19] powers
[49:23] can control a person to a place to where
[49:26] they can use that person's tongue
[49:28] to speak the desire of satan
[49:36] that's heavy amen
[49:46] matthew 12.
[49:59] matthew 12 starting at verse 30.
[50:05] it says he that is not with me is
[50:09] against me and he that gathereth not
[50:11] with me scattereth abroad
[50:13] wherefor i say unto you all manner of
[50:15] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven
[50:17] unto men but the blasphemy against the
[50:19] holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto
[50:21] men
[50:22] he says whosoever notice how he says
[50:24] this now
[50:26] and it's tied again to the mouth death
[50:28] and life is in the power of the tongue
[50:32] he says verse 32 and whosoever
[50:36] speaketh a word against the son of man
[50:39] it shall be forgiven him
[50:41] but whosoever speaketh against the holy
[50:43] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[50:45] neither in this world neither the world
[50:47] to come
[50:48] either make the tree and the fruit and
[50:50] his fruit good
[50:51] or else make the tree corrupt and his
[50:53] fruit corrupt for the tree is known by
[50:56] his fruit
[50:57] o generation of vipers how can ye notice
[51:00] how he says this now
[51:01] how can ye being evil speak good things
[51:06] for out of the abundance where of the
[51:08] heart
[51:10] the mouth speaketh a good man out of the
[51:12] good treasure of his heart bringeth
[51:14] forth good things and the evil man out
[51:15] of the evil treasure
[51:17] bringeth forth evil things he says but i
[51:19] say unto you that
[51:20] every idle word every word
[51:28] no matter where it's spoken or who is
[51:29] spoken to
[51:32] he says every idle word that men
[51:35] shall speak they shall give an account
[51:37] thereof in the day of judgment for by
[51:39] thy words thou shalt be justified
[51:42] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[51:47] so it's a lot of weight that god is
[51:49] placing upon
[51:51] what we say let's pray
[51:54] lord jesus please have your way
[51:58] lord we love you you love your people
[52:00] you love us all
[52:02] share with us your desire in jesus
[52:04] christ's name we ask it
[52:05] amen god bless you saints sorry to have
[52:08] you standing so long
[52:18] i haven't been able to get away from
[52:19] this for quite some time now
[52:23] and even though i've been led to
[52:26] minister this
[52:27] in different different locations and
[52:29] things of that nature
[52:31] even though i was coming when i was
[52:33] asked to come here which was on
[52:35] yesterday
[52:38] i didn't just want to speak on this
[52:40] because it's something that i've been
[52:41] speaking on
[52:43] we don't want to just speak things out
[52:45] of convenience
[52:46] we want to be able to speak according to
[52:48] god's will
[52:50] and so i was after i was asked i just
[52:52] kind of
[52:53] began to become prayerful and i asked
[52:56] god to help me
[52:57] because there's many different things
[52:59] that could have been spoken on
[53:01] and as i was just praying and yesterday
[53:03] i found myself fasting
[53:06] and uh now just praying and just kind of
[53:09] going about my day and
[53:11] he brought something back i started
[53:14] listening to
[53:14] a particular sermon not knowing
[53:17] what was going to be the contents of it
[53:19] and he brought something back and as
[53:22] soon as
[53:23] it hit a certain part this just kind of
[53:26] it just came to the forefront of my
[53:28] heart and just stayed there
[53:31] and over the years i've just kind of
[53:33] learned i don't know at all i'm still
[53:35] learning i'm still a child
[53:38] you know but i've learned to just kind
[53:41] of
[53:41] sense when the lord is leading in a
[53:44] certain direction
[53:46] don't don't always get it right but it's
[53:48] just i don't know it's becoming more
[53:50] familiar to me now
[53:53] so then this particular subject i felt
[53:55] like was his will
[53:56] for me to share with the church uh it's
[53:59] not a rebuke
[54:00] so you know i pray that the enemy don't
[54:02] bring that across to anybody's mind like
[54:05] that
[54:06] but i believe it's something that god is
[54:08] sharing with with
[54:09] us to help us to come up higher uh
[54:12] because he's a father and as a father
[54:15] you
[54:15] you know i'm a father i got five
[54:17] children and i've
[54:19] i'm still learning my children helped me
[54:21] to learn so much
[54:23] they've helped me to grow so much over
[54:24] time you know god has used my family
[54:28] and uh but but you you have to deal with
[54:30] things at times
[54:32] that are needful but not pleasurable
[54:36] meaning it's not pleasing to the ear
[54:39] it's not anything to make you laugh
[54:40] like that you know what i mean but yet
[54:43] it's needful for the soul is needful
[54:46] for the building of the right things so
[54:48] that we can have a more victorious walk
[54:51] you know in this life so as a subject
[54:54] this morning i want to share
[54:55] uh just as the lord would help me a
[54:58] portion of what i
[54:59] have on my heart concerning a perfect
[55:01] man
[55:03] a perfect man as we've read saints it
[55:07] matters to god
[55:08] how we speak
[55:12] not just how we speak to saints in the
[55:14] church
[55:15] but how we speak to anybody
[55:19] and i say that and i want to point you
[55:20] back to himself
[55:23] in the scripture look at how he
[55:25] conducted himself
[55:28] the bible says the common people heard
[55:30] him gladly
[55:31] the bible says republicans and sinners
[55:35] they felt comfortable enough around him
[55:38] to want to join themselves with him
[55:40] wherever he was just to sit down
[55:43] even though they were in the condition
[55:45] that they were in they man they didn't
[55:47] feel intimidated
[55:49] by christ but i believe in my heart by
[55:54] the scriptures
[55:55] what they felt saints was a love
[56:00] and because he was who he was he knew
[56:02] all things right
[56:04] amen so so he understood every one of
[56:07] their conditions
[56:11] even when they were wrongly accusing him
[56:16] i pray the lord help me not to keep you
[56:18] long this morning but
[56:19] lord just guide my words because this is
[56:22] very important
[56:23] even even when they were wrongly
[56:25] accusing him right
[56:27] and had a wrong mind toward him wrong
[56:30] attitudes toward him
[56:35] look at how he handled them
[56:38] on the cross right
[56:41] on the cross they were crying out for
[56:44] his blood
[56:44] they placed him up there isn't that
[56:46] right they placed him up there
[56:49] he didn't deserve to be there we know he
[56:52] was fulfilling scripture
[56:54] it was for our good but he didn't
[56:56] deserve to be there
[56:58] and and they were shouting around him
[57:00] crucify him
[57:03] put him through great torture and pain
[57:06] and he had done no wrong the question
[57:10] was that
[57:11] for what what did he do what did he do
[57:14] to deserve this he didn't do anything
[57:17] but even in that state when they were
[57:20] wrong and he was completely right
[57:21] and innocent saints look at what came
[57:24] out of his mouth
[57:28] looking upon the crowd beating up
[57:30] hurting
[57:31] pain in his body
[57:35] looking upon those that did him that way
[57:38] and out of his mouth from his heart
[57:40] because he was god
[57:44] he said father forgive them for they
[57:47] know not what they do
[57:53] so the bible says he's the same
[57:54] yesterday
[57:56] today and forever
[57:59] so when he's in us
[58:03] he's no less than what he expressed when
[58:05] he was walking on the earth in that body
[58:08] he's the same person and that person is
[58:11] trying to bring us somewhere
[58:14] he's trying to bring us to a maturity
[58:17] sense
[58:18] a spiritual maturity but we can rise
[58:22] above
[58:23] what i would call human foolishness
[58:27] gossiping backbiting
[58:31] amen carnal divisions
[58:34] amongst people amongst churches
[58:38] now we understand
[58:47] the people of god the children of god
[58:50] the true children of god
[58:53] you're called to a higher place
[58:56] because of who you are everybody's not
[58:59] called to that place
[59:03] so it doesn't matter how many people
[59:05] around you
[59:07] are acting in whatever kind of a way
[59:11] god is his god's eyes on you
[59:16] he's expecting he's expecting something
[59:19] more
[59:20] from us he won't allow us to act like
[59:24] everybody else
[59:33] can we say praise the lord
[59:40] this ain't an easy way
[59:44] when it comes to human ability
[59:47] isn't that right because the because
[59:49] based upon how you're treated like right
[59:51] now in this room right here
[59:53] there are wounds spiritual and
[59:57] spiritual i was about to say mental but
[59:59] it's connected
[1:00:00] it's the spirit of your mind because
[1:00:02] your spirit controls your thoughts isn't
[1:00:04] that right
[1:00:06] there are spiritual wounds that people
[1:00:08] have
[1:00:09] hurts things that have taken place over
[1:00:13] time
[1:00:14] that's been caused by the devil
[1:00:18] and in our weakness listen and in our
[1:00:20] immaturity
[1:00:24] we we we adopt certain ways of thinking
[1:00:27] and viewing
[1:00:28] people we come to church
[1:00:31] and we hear all about the devil but
[1:00:34] can't recognize the devil
[1:00:38] when he's in our own minds
[1:00:41] causing us to look at people in a wrong
[1:00:43] way
[1:00:44] listen now causing us to put our mouths
[1:00:48] on people
[1:00:48] in a wrong way and somehow we think we
[1:00:53] special at times
[1:00:54] and we think that because it's us and
[1:00:56] our thoughts and our words
[1:00:58] that god somehow is condoning us and
[1:01:01] saying that's right son of child you
[1:01:02] writing your thoughts you
[1:01:04] know son james and john
[1:01:07] came listen it wasn't even near battle
[1:01:11] but jesus was going to jerusalem
[1:01:15] but he was going to stop by samaria and
[1:01:17] the samaritans wouldn't
[1:01:19] wouldn't receive him because it looked
[1:01:21] like he was going to jerusalem
[1:01:23] and they had a little division amongst
[1:01:25] them right and james and john
[1:01:30] they saw that listen this is real
[1:01:33] important his sins
[1:01:35] that was their friend christ was their
[1:01:39] friend
[1:01:40] you know how people get you know how
[1:01:42] friends get if one friend don't like
[1:01:44] somebody all of a sudden
[1:01:46] well i don't like them either
[1:01:50] that's okay it ain't okay never but
[1:01:54] amongst the world that's common
[1:01:56] but in church
[1:02:00] we got to be able to stand with christ
[1:02:03] it don't matter who it is in my own
[1:02:07] family if daddy is wrong
[1:02:09] children wife you follow christ
[1:02:15] isn't that right so it ain't no no of
[1:02:18] you against that oh you know i'm against
[1:02:20] them too uh
[1:02:20] you know because i know you got
[1:02:22] something against him now i got a little
[1:02:23] funny feeling i don't want him to do
[1:02:25] with him either now that's foolishness
[1:02:26] man
[1:02:27] god ain't pleased with that
[1:02:31] how are we gonna listen all of us have
[1:02:33] our weaknesses
[1:02:35] we have our times of failure huh
[1:02:39] how does he handle us
[1:02:44] huh we working against him hurting him
[1:02:47] in his heart
[1:02:48] does he put us away from him how
[1:02:52] welcoming is he
[1:02:53] amen listen now at the end his
[1:02:56] face we sin against him
[1:03:02] how welcome is he to us
[1:03:07] see the natural man can't handle these
[1:03:09] kind of things
[1:03:11] it takes the spirit of god upon a heart
[1:03:13] and a mind
[1:03:14] to bring a man subject to his spirit and
[1:03:18] to his will listen now
[1:03:20] that's why there is no real
[1:03:24] victory outside of the baptism of the
[1:03:26] holy ghost
[1:03:30] god is the one that gives us what we
[1:03:32] need to be
[1:03:33] able amen to conduct ourselves listen
[1:03:36] to bride of the whole body
[1:03:40] without him saying that we can't control
[1:03:43] our
[1:03:44] tongue because whenever you're hurt
[1:03:46] listen like i said there's
[1:03:47] wounds in here right even though i'm
[1:03:50] preaching this
[1:03:51] sometimes some people still have a hard
[1:03:53] time letting stuff go
[1:03:55] so and so did you just don't know
[1:03:57] brother so and so did me like that
[1:03:59] you will see him again and the devil now
[1:04:01] the devil will work through your memory
[1:04:04] your emotions huh those inlets to the
[1:04:07] spirit
[1:04:09] your consciousness the devil will work
[1:04:11] through those things as soon as you see
[1:04:13] a person
[1:04:13] he'll be right there to try to
[1:04:15] reactivate
[1:04:17] those thoughts and those connected
[1:04:19] feelings
[1:04:20] that keep us bound because whenever
[1:04:24] we're like that now the holy spirit
[1:04:26] can't truly come and rest upon
[1:04:28] us we got to be like lambs
[1:04:37] he said we are counted as sheep for the
[1:04:39] slaughter
[1:04:41] slaughter of what slaughter of ourselves
[1:04:44] a killing of ourselves
[1:04:47] i'm talking about a perfect man now
[1:04:52] see because where do your words come
[1:04:53] from your words come from thoughts
[1:04:58] isn't that right how many can say amen
[1:05:01] today
[1:05:03] your words come from thoughts it's not
[1:05:04] just your mouth your mouth just don't
[1:05:06] run by itself
[1:05:10] nobody's mouth just runs by itself it's
[1:05:13] the communication
[1:05:15] and if you listen real carefully if
[1:05:17] we're in the right place
[1:05:19] because jesus when james and john called
[1:05:22] out like that that was their friend
[1:05:24] and they felt like they were standing up
[1:05:26] for their friend
[1:05:28] but even though jesus was their friend
[1:05:30] and their husband and their lord
[1:05:32] he wasn't with them in their era
[1:05:38] so when he saw they got off track with
[1:05:41] his mind
[1:05:43] and his way he looked at them
[1:05:47] knowing they were trying to stand for
[1:05:48] what's right but he had to call it out
[1:05:51] he said you don't know what spirit you
[1:05:52] are
[1:05:56] where i'm at right now i didn't come to
[1:05:58] destroy men's lives but to save it
[1:06:02] they're acting like that now but they're
[1:06:05] still
[1:06:05] amongst that group because the woman at
[1:06:07] the well
[1:06:11] listen the woman at the well
[1:06:15] and then when she went back and
[1:06:16] testified the people of the city came
[1:06:21] of samaria
[1:06:25] you understand what i'm saying
[1:06:29] so saints this thing is set in such a
[1:06:31] way the only
[1:06:32] real safe plot for us to be the only
[1:06:34] real safe frame of mind for us to have
[1:06:36] is that of a child
[1:06:39] you can't trust how you see things
[1:06:44] because you can look at something and
[1:06:45] see absolutely wrong
[1:06:49] no matter how many experiences you've
[1:06:50] had with god amen
[1:06:52] god got to continue to lead us
[1:06:57] i'm no authority on nothing lord i need
[1:06:59] you for everything
[1:07:02] if i see a situation i can't come to a
[1:07:04] conclusion
[1:07:06] lord i don't know what to think he asks
[1:07:09] ezekiel
[1:07:10] son of man can these dry bones live
[1:07:14] ezekiel saw all them bones
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:18] and he did the safest thing that he
[1:07:20] could i ordered
[1:07:22] he said lord thou knowest
[1:07:26] because to him and his mind i know
[1:07:28] humanly speaking
[1:07:30] from a natural mind it didn't look
[1:07:32] possible
[1:07:34] but ezekiel knew that god was far above
[1:07:37] man's ability he said thou
[1:07:41] knowest lord and that's how i feel
[1:07:44] i see things i see mistreatments listen
[1:07:48] the lord has allowed me to go through
[1:07:50] many things
[1:07:52] people look at you from the outside and
[1:07:54] think they you know it's like
[1:07:56] they're too quick to to assume things
[1:08:04] we're going to get into something here
[1:08:05] in a moment matthew 5
[1:08:08] he says in verse 43 ye have heard that
[1:08:11] it hath been said thou shalt love thy
[1:08:13] neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:08:15] he says but i say unto you love your
[1:08:17] enemies
[1:08:19] think about that somebody you actually
[1:08:22] consider to be an enemy is somebody that
[1:08:24] you feel like obviously has done you
[1:08:26] great harm
[1:08:28] or is against you in an extreme way
[1:08:34] maybe you don't know why do we realize
[1:08:37] things that god will allow those kinds
[1:08:39] of things to or rather do you realize
[1:08:41] that god has allowed those things to be
[1:08:43] placed in your course
[1:08:46] in your course of life he's allowed
[1:08:49] situations and people
[1:08:52] to come into your life to cross your
[1:08:54] path
[1:08:56] listen and to you in your mind you're
[1:08:59] probably like man i wish i would have
[1:09:00] never met this person
[1:09:03] but in god's mind he's saying that's the
[1:09:06] right kind of a person you needed in
[1:09:07] your life
[1:09:09] because there is something imma work
[1:09:10] with you on
[1:09:13] the focus ain't them yeah they acting
[1:09:16] like they acting and whatever but i
[1:09:18] i allowed that to happen because it's
[1:09:20] something i want to deal with you on
[1:09:24] sometimes we don't see things in the
[1:09:26] right way
[1:09:33] verse 44 but i say unto you love your
[1:09:35] enemies bless them that curse you
[1:09:39] that's not what's in our minds is it
[1:09:42] somebody cursing you and speaking bad
[1:09:44] about you
[1:09:45] and you hearing about it from other
[1:09:46] people
[1:09:48] huh that's not the normal reaction of a
[1:09:52] man
[1:09:53] or a woman
[1:09:56] amen the mindset is what hurt feelings
[1:10:00] now that's where the enemy slips in
[1:10:02] right there why they talking about me
[1:10:05] like that
[1:10:05] and guess what what happened saints if
[1:10:07] you're not careful that anointing comes
[1:10:09] upon you
[1:10:10] and you know what you do you begin to go
[1:10:12] back and talk about them
[1:10:22] bless them that curse you
[1:10:25] do good to them that hate you
[1:10:29] it's very contrary to the way the world
[1:10:31] operates
[1:10:33] but it's well within how god operates
[1:10:39] see the world ain't going in a rapture
[1:10:43] who's going in the rapture raise your
[1:10:46] hand if you believe you're gonna go in
[1:10:47] the rapture
[1:10:49] huh
[1:10:52] those that are going in a rapture guess
[1:10:53] what the requirement is saints to be
[1:10:55] just
[1:10:56] like him the bible says it does not yet
[1:11:00] appear
[1:11:00] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:11:03] he appears
[1:11:04] we shall be just like him
[1:11:07] in every way not just in
[1:11:11] the laying on of hands to heal the sick
[1:11:13] and things of that nature that's all
[1:11:14] well and fine
[1:11:16] but people anointed by wrong spirits can
[1:11:18] do that
[1:11:19] isn't that right amen
[1:11:23] but satan can't be the holy ghost
[1:11:27] huh he can try to put on an image he can
[1:11:30] try to act
[1:11:31] throw a facade out there but you listen
[1:11:34] real carefully and you watch the actions
[1:11:37] it'll begin to show itself it will begin
[1:11:40] to bleed through
[1:11:42] the smoke screen
[1:11:50] he says and pray for them which
[1:11:51] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:11:53] that ye may notice how he says this now
[1:11:55] that ye may be the children of your
[1:11:58] father which is in heaven
[1:12:00] why because that's how he was
[1:12:03] the bible says the rich young ruler even
[1:12:06] though he was turning them down the
[1:12:08] bible says
[1:12:09] jesus looked at him and loved him
[1:12:14] isn't that right those that were
[1:12:17] crucifying him again
[1:12:18] he says father forgive them for they
[1:12:20] know not what they do
[1:12:21] and then when the same spirit came upon
[1:12:25] a man listen
[1:12:26] there wasn't a virgin born but that was
[1:12:28] sin born
[1:12:30] stephen
[1:12:34] with that same spirit on the inside of
[1:12:36] him
[1:12:37] it caused him to look upon his killers
[1:12:44] and that same one that spoke on the
[1:12:46] cross that same one was inside of
[1:12:48] stephen now
[1:12:50] and even though his life was being taken
[1:12:53] he was able to beat listen he wasn't
[1:12:54] just saying that because he was well you
[1:12:56] know people
[1:12:57] people are going to come behind and read
[1:12:59] about what happened to me so let me just
[1:13:01] say the right thing so that they'll be
[1:13:02] able to have something positive to hang
[1:13:04] on to
[1:13:05] no sir by nature
[1:13:09] it was a part of who he was
[1:13:13] and in that kind of a moment saints out
[1:13:15] of that man's lips
[1:13:17] he asked for forgiveness of those that
[1:13:19] were killing him
[1:13:21] with the last few breaths he had in his
[1:13:24] body
[1:13:30] just think about what are some of your
[1:13:32] thoughts and your feelings about those
[1:13:34] in your life that the lord is allowed to
[1:13:36] cross your path
[1:13:37] what are your thoughts and your feelings
[1:13:39] toward those individuals
[1:13:46] and just understand that it must be
[1:13:48] brought into a place to where it matches
[1:13:50] the word
[1:13:55] your words come from thoughts
[1:13:58] and your thoughts come from your heart
[1:14:02] and whatever inspiration is upon a
[1:14:04] person
[1:14:05] that's what determines how they'll think
[1:14:07] and how they'll speak
[1:14:10] that's why the bible says that a tongue
[1:14:13] if a person is not careful
[1:14:15] it'll be set on fire of hell
[1:14:18] who wants that to be their case
[1:14:24] i'ma touch upon a few things here saints
[1:14:32] everybody all right praise the lord
[1:14:40] notice here in james chapter 1 and verse
[1:14:43] 26
[1:14:46] it says if any man among you seem
[1:14:51] seem to be religious
[1:14:56] you know we come to church or whatever
[1:15:00] you know uh we learn
[1:15:04] we learn through the word of god how god
[1:15:07] is and what god's expectations all right
[1:15:10] and it's only right that we try
[1:15:14] to live better than before right
[1:15:18] and that's what our journey has been
[1:15:20] it's not
[1:15:21] that every time you went to try to do
[1:15:23] what was right
[1:15:25] it was easy for you you know for
[1:15:28] whatever growth we've seen
[1:15:30] over time up to this point it's been
[1:15:32] purely by the grace of god
[1:15:35] it's not been it's not been due to how
[1:15:37] hard we've tried
[1:15:39] but at the same time when we hear the
[1:15:41] word of god when we
[1:15:43] for true bride members now when you hear
[1:15:45] that word of god
[1:15:46] and it touches upon your life and you
[1:15:48] feel that prick
[1:15:49] there's something in you that wants to
[1:15:51] what wants to give god his desire
[1:15:54] you don't want to be displeasing to him
[1:15:55] isn't that right
[1:15:57] that's why we come to church right
[1:15:58] because we want to be better
[1:16:00] and god is here to make us better but
[1:16:03] it's a struggle at times
[1:16:05] it's a struggle it's many struggles that
[1:16:07] we must go through
[1:16:10] we struggle within ourselves with
[1:16:12] ourselves
[1:16:15] so in that in that time and that process
[1:16:17] saints we try to act right we try to do
[1:16:20] what's right
[1:16:20] amen which is good we ain't gonna say
[1:16:23] nothing against that
[1:16:24] but there is something that's very real
[1:16:26] that once
[1:16:27] it comes in you're able to rest
[1:16:31] you cease from your own works
[1:16:36] you understand stephen was resting
[1:16:40] he wasn't trying to work up anything
[1:16:43] it just flowed from that brother's heart
[1:16:45] it flowed from his heart
[1:16:47] into his mind and out of his mouth it
[1:16:49] wasn't fake or put on
[1:16:55] it was the genuine moving of the holy
[1:16:57] ghost
[1:17:00] and i know that's our desire we know
[1:17:03] that god has given us many victory
[1:17:05] saints
[1:17:06] but this right here
[1:17:10] at the end of the service i'm gonna
[1:17:11] share something with you
[1:17:14] we're right there we're right at a major
[1:17:18] junction right now
[1:17:19] listen i don't care how you feel
[1:17:22] i don't care how you see yourself i
[1:17:24] don't care what you got going on in your
[1:17:26] life right now
[1:17:28] that does not change or or stop or alter
[1:17:31] in any way
[1:17:32] the movement of god and the timing of
[1:17:35] his plan
[1:17:36] the rapture is gonna listen the rap god
[1:17:39] knows what day what hour what year what
[1:17:41] have you the rapture is gonna happen
[1:17:43] right now
[1:17:44] isn't that right we don't know it but he
[1:17:46] knows it but guess what
[1:17:48] whenever that time comes everyone that's
[1:17:51] supposed to be in that rapture no matter
[1:17:52] what condition they're in they're going
[1:17:54] to be ready
[1:17:56] it's going to be by the power of god
[1:17:59] that's why our faith has to rise
[1:18:02] to such a place in god to where we can
[1:18:05] believe him for anything
[1:18:06] we don't care about the symptoms that's
[1:18:08] why listen you you
[1:18:10] i understand we all got problems we all
[1:18:12] got things going on even in me preaching
[1:18:13] what i'm preaching right now
[1:18:15] even if it's touching upon your life
[1:18:17] okay that's good okay repent
[1:18:20] put forth the best step you put forward
[1:18:22] and say go tomorrow
[1:18:23] take the bet you know put forth a good
[1:18:25] effort to make another step that's a
[1:18:27] better step than what you did yesterday
[1:18:29] right try your best but that faith
[1:18:33] lord i believe i see my inadequacies
[1:18:37] i see my failures i see my weak areas
[1:18:40] lord you know all about me
[1:18:42] but lord i believe and i trust in you
[1:18:45] to make me into what you desire for me
[1:18:47] to be
[1:18:48] he's the potter listen he can do it
[1:18:53] in a second
[1:18:56] do you believe that in your sight you
[1:18:59] might say man i got so much good brother
[1:19:01] i hear you preaching right now bro
[1:19:02] that a lot of that apply to me
[1:19:06] god can change it before the service
[1:19:08] ends
[1:19:11] where's your faith
[1:19:16] it's that simple now don't don't don't
[1:19:18] don't don't
[1:19:19] don't let it go over your heads
[1:19:23] that faith is already with us
[1:19:28] amen all we have to do is release it to
[1:19:31] god
[1:19:33] and in that atmosphere of faith he'll
[1:19:35] drop down saints and he'll do
[1:19:37] he'll he's god it
[1:19:43] it goes so far beyond us
[1:19:48] see for sister beverly it was her time
[1:19:50] to go
[1:19:51] that's why even though the prayers were
[1:19:53] offered up and then even she was
[1:19:54] believing
[1:19:55] it was it was just her time you
[1:19:56] understand that
[1:19:58] but until we knew it was her time we
[1:20:01] believed god for the miraculous
[1:20:04] and even though the lord allowed her to
[1:20:06] pass guess what we don't care if
[1:20:07] somebody else rise up with the same
[1:20:09] situation
[1:20:10] we're going to believe god that's how
[1:20:13] god designed for it to be
[1:20:14] that's what he's looking for in his
[1:20:16] church saints
[1:20:17] to believe him regardless
[1:20:25] i got needs right now
[1:20:28] i got serious situations surrounding me
[1:20:33] but by the grace of god i'm in a better
[1:20:35] place
[1:20:38] we're human and the enemy knows how to
[1:20:39] try to pluck out our streams
[1:20:42] because we're still in a fallen body man
[1:20:45] in a human spirit
[1:20:46] you know our spirit you know even though
[1:20:48] it's anointed by the holy spirit yet
[1:20:50] is able also to be receptive to evil
[1:20:53] spirits
[1:20:55] you can have the baptism of the holy
[1:20:57] ghost in the soul and still entertain
[1:20:59] wrong spirits
[1:21:03] but because god is where he is remember
[1:21:06] a big ship is turned about by a very
[1:21:09] small hymn
[1:21:11] brother branham as he spoke about the
[1:21:13] holy ghost coming into his life
[1:21:15] he said it was about the size of a
[1:21:16] fingernail
[1:21:20] that light coming down into that soul
[1:21:23] amen and moving a whole man about
[1:21:27] controlling his thoughts controlling his
[1:21:29] words
[1:21:30] bringing him subject that's what the
[1:21:32] holy ghost is doing inside of us right
[1:21:34] now saying he's giving us victory over
[1:21:35] ourselves
[1:21:37] can we say praise the lord to that he's
[1:21:40] leading us into battle within ourselves
[1:21:43] he ain't needing you to be in a battle
[1:21:44] with somebody else's life
[1:21:46] god's causing you to focus in on you
[1:21:49] he's building us up as individuals
[1:21:52] getting us individually ready for a
[1:21:54] rapture
[1:21:55] and he's there i believe he's there
[1:22:01] praise the lord notice how he says this
[1:22:04] though
[1:22:05] if any man among you seem to be
[1:22:07] religious he says
[1:22:09] or not bridleth not his tongue
[1:22:13] it says but deceiveth his own heart
[1:22:16] this man's religion is vain
[1:22:23] isn't that something
[1:22:26] got all the right acts come to church
[1:22:29] worship all that stuff
[1:22:30] pay tithes seem to be faithful
[1:22:34] but quick to say any and everything that
[1:22:36] come to his mind or her mind
[1:22:39] you know how people sometimes say i got
[1:22:40] to just tell it like it is brother
[1:22:42] that's just how i am
[1:22:43] well make sure how you are is the way he
[1:22:45] wants you to be
[1:22:48] cause in his word
[1:22:52] said be therefore perfect
[1:22:55] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:22:58] it spoke about him
[1:22:59] loving his enemies those that persecuted
[1:23:03] him and came against him
[1:23:06] how did he conduct himself from his
[1:23:09] heart
[1:23:11] because he's a god of love he's not
[1:23:14] willing to and it should perish
[1:23:17] but it all should come to repentance
[1:23:21] amen saints i don't want to vain
[1:23:24] religion
[1:23:27] though i give my body to be burned very
[1:23:30] helpful everywhere to do all kind of
[1:23:32] things for anybody
[1:23:34] and you have not charity all your works
[1:23:39] all of your good deeds the bible says
[1:23:42] means
[1:23:42] zero to god
[1:23:46] i'm talking about a real place
[1:23:51] this is what all this was about this is
[1:23:53] this is why the this is what god sent
[1:23:55] elijah
[1:23:56] this is why god opened the seven seal
[1:23:58] saints it all draws down to what i'm
[1:24:01] talking about right
[1:24:02] now god having full control
[1:24:06] inside of a people that's ordained
[1:24:09] to unfold his person in these last days
[1:24:14] and i believe we are that people and
[1:24:17] what is god doing says he's operating on
[1:24:19] us
[1:24:21] we're on the surgery table right now and
[1:24:23] the holy ghost with his word
[1:24:25] he's cutting down to those needful areas
[1:24:28] to do what saints to heal us
[1:24:32] amen to uproot the devil amen to cut out
[1:24:35] bitterness and malice and strife
[1:24:39] took a reader to create an atmosphere
[1:24:41] saints
[1:24:43] that he can really step down in hey man
[1:24:46] the bible says god want to walk in us
[1:24:54] we ain't got to toot no horn all we got
[1:24:57] to do is humble ourselves
[1:25:00] and just go about everyday life
[1:25:04] and let you just
[1:25:07] ministering for popularity
[1:25:10] ministering for money ministering for
[1:25:14] the building of any kind of a reputation
[1:25:19] any minister with any any one of those
[1:25:21] things that's predominant in his mind
[1:25:22] and heart
[1:25:24] you need to do all of us a help and sit
[1:25:26] down
[1:25:28] because he ain't useful he's wasting
[1:25:31] time
[1:25:36] that word preeminent it means
[1:25:41] having rank listen having rank
[1:25:45] dignity or importance that's supreme
[1:25:49] to all others
[1:25:56] the bible says saints that god is called
[1:25:59] for us to love him
[1:26:00] with all of our mind all of our heart
[1:26:05] and all of our strength but the brandon
[1:26:08] said god wants to have the preeminence
[1:26:12] he want he wants to be the supreme thing
[1:26:15] in each one of our lives
[1:26:16] that carries the most importance to us
[1:26:19] because when he's in that rightful place
[1:26:21] in our lives
[1:26:22] that'll control and dictate how
[1:26:24] everything else flows from our life
[1:26:28] and it doesn't matter how pleasing we
[1:26:30] can be to another person
[1:26:33] it's how pleasing we can be to him and
[1:26:36] when we're pleasing to him
[1:26:37] everything else will fall in his
[1:26:39] rightful place
[1:26:41] all right i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try
[1:26:42] to wrap this up because i'm just feeling
[1:26:45] i'm feeling like you know it's it's just
[1:26:48] i need to kind of draw it down
[1:26:50] ecclesiastes chapter five
[1:26:53] starting in verse one because notice
[1:26:56] this now our prophet told us that our
[1:26:58] thoughts
[1:26:59] are heard louder in heaven than our
[1:27:02] words are upon the earth right
[1:27:05] so it's not just the speaking that's one
[1:27:07] it it goes all the way down to the soul
[1:27:09] because when your soul is right
[1:27:12] then and god listen and when we we begin
[1:27:15] to die
[1:27:15] and to yield to god more and more when
[1:27:18] our soul is right amen
[1:27:20] our spirit will be right because he came
[1:27:22] he he also is
[1:27:23] is helping us in our spirit isn't that
[1:27:25] right he's telling us from the control
[1:27:27] tower
[1:27:28] what things are wrong and how he wants
[1:27:30] things done
[1:27:32] when our soul is right then our thoughts
[1:27:34] will become right
[1:27:35] when our thoughts are right then our
[1:27:36] words have become right
[1:27:38] so the whole focus is the soul
[1:27:42] even if we've had experiences with god's
[1:27:44] sayings how many realize we need
[1:27:46] more we need we we we need to we we need
[1:27:49] a refreshing
[1:27:51] so much is going on say we need a
[1:27:53] refreshing i need a refreshing
[1:27:55] i need a fresh refilling of the holy
[1:27:58] ghost
[1:27:59] amen stephen the bible said
[1:28:02] was full of the holy ghost
[1:28:07] it don't really don't matter if the
[1:28:08] whole church is there whatever let us
[1:28:10] individually be there
[1:28:14] it ain't about my family i love my
[1:28:16] family
[1:28:17] right but what the lord has been helping
[1:28:20] me to see
[1:28:21] look you come into your place you yield
[1:28:24] to me more you die
[1:28:26] you you you give me my desire and let's
[1:28:29] listen now he'll display himself
[1:28:34] in such a way that it'll bring forth
[1:28:37] such a witness
[1:28:39] you talking about a revival it's more
[1:28:43] than just words
[1:28:45] speaking intellect we can learn a whole
[1:28:47] lot and speak a whole lot
[1:28:49] but people want to see something they
[1:28:52] want to see a living god
[1:28:54] they just want to hear the words of a
[1:28:55] living god they want to be able to see
[1:28:57] him
[1:28:59] amen
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:06] ecclesiastes 5 starting at verse 1
[1:29:08] saints it says
[1:29:10] keep thy foot when thou goes to the
[1:29:12] house of god
[1:29:14] and be more ready to hear than to give
[1:29:17] the sacrifice of fools
[1:29:19] he says for they consider not that they
[1:29:20] do evil
[1:29:22] verse 2 says be not rash with thy mouth
[1:29:26] that means don't be quick amen be not
[1:29:30] rash with thy mouth he says
[1:29:32] and let not thine heart listen now
[1:29:35] the prophet said our thoughts are heard
[1:29:37] louder in heaven and our words are upon
[1:29:39] the earth
[1:29:39] he says and let not thine heart be hasty
[1:29:42] to utter anything before god
[1:29:46] when jesus went to the house of simon
[1:29:50] the bible says simon stouk's word
[1:29:54] if he knew what manner of woman that was
[1:29:57] who touched him if he was a prophet he
[1:30:00] would know that
[1:30:02] he didn't open his mouth but yet he
[1:30:04] opened his heart
[1:30:06] and even though his lips didn't move god
[1:30:09] heard every word
[1:30:11] and jesus turned and addressed him based
[1:30:14] off of his thoughts
[1:30:17] sometimes we come to church and we get
[1:30:19] real good at not saying something
[1:30:22] but you're thinking a whole lot he says
[1:30:25] how can you being evil
[1:30:27] speak good things
[1:30:31] all kind of activity in the inside
[1:30:35] but yet oh praise the lord hey how you
[1:30:38] doing brother branham said in his own
[1:30:39] church people walking by
[1:30:41] telling them he loved him and everything
[1:30:42] and he said you know you don't
[1:30:48] but guess what that didn't stop him from
[1:30:49] loving them
[1:30:51] and desiring to see them changed
[1:30:54] isn't that right so god don't want
[1:30:57] something else to be in our hearts and
[1:30:59] we saying something else with our mouth
[1:31:01] he wanted to match he want the heart to
[1:31:04] match the mind and the mind to match the
[1:31:05] words of the mouth
[1:31:09] he wanted all to come on to come from
[1:31:11] him
[1:31:13] amen so he's telling us how we should be
[1:31:16] careful now
[1:31:18] let not thine heart be hasty to utter
[1:31:20] anything before god
[1:31:22] for god is in heaven and thou upon the
[1:31:24] earth therefore let thy words
[1:31:26] be few for a dream coming through the
[1:31:30] multitude of business and a fool's voice
[1:31:32] is known by multitude of words
[1:31:35] many times when i'm around people i
[1:31:37] don't know or whatever that well i just
[1:31:39] listen
[1:31:42] i ain't got to say a whole lot even if
[1:31:45] i'm around ministers a lot of times i'm
[1:31:47] just quiet
[1:31:49] because i just listen you just hear just
[1:31:51] kind of hear what's going on
[1:31:53] sometimes if you talk too much you miss
[1:31:55] things anyway
[1:31:56] you know how sometimes you you you can
[1:31:58] talk to somebody they just talking
[1:32:00] talking talking talking
[1:32:02] talking talking and you try to say a
[1:32:03] little something but they got the next
[1:32:04] thing they want to say in mind
[1:32:06] so then when you say what you say it's
[1:32:08] almost like they ain't even hear you
[1:32:10] so usually having a conversation by
[1:32:12] yourself
[1:32:15] uh amen but listen the bible tells us
[1:32:19] amen just just to listen
[1:32:21] watch this now come into a close saints
[1:32:27] i think that was in james also if i'm
[1:32:29] not mistaken
[1:32:34] anyway you know the scripture the bible
[1:32:35] says let us be quick to hear
[1:32:38] slow to speak and slow the wrath
[1:32:42] what is god doing just don't be so quick
[1:32:44] to say whatever's on your mind
[1:32:47] just don't be so quick to receive every
[1:32:49] thought that comes to your mind
[1:32:51] the bible says we we we need to take
[1:32:53] into captivity what
[1:32:54] every thought to the obedience of christ
[1:32:59] anything that tries to exalt itself
[1:33:01] above the knowledge of god
[1:33:03] the word of god listen how you gonna do
[1:33:05] that you gotta consider your thoughts
[1:33:08] just because your thoughts come to your
[1:33:10] mind that don't make it right
[1:33:13] but that's how we feel many times
[1:33:15] brother i'm thinking it so it must be
[1:33:17] right
[1:33:18] we don't even question where it's coming
[1:33:20] from
[1:33:24] there's a way that seemeth right unto a
[1:33:26] man
[1:33:27] it seems but the bible also
[1:33:30] our hearts is very wicked and deceiving
[1:33:34] oh we all over the place saints
[1:33:40] lord have mercy where are we at here
[1:33:43] in psalms 19 verse 12 it says who can
[1:33:47] understand his errors
[1:33:51] if i ask the question who in here knows
[1:33:53] themselves
[1:33:56] we all like right now we ain't gonna
[1:33:59] raise our hands
[1:34:01] but many times we feel like we know
[1:34:03] ourselves you know
[1:34:04] if anybody know me as me
[1:34:07] right how many realize the bible lets us
[1:34:10] know different
[1:34:12] you can think you know yourself but not
[1:34:14] even know yourself
[1:34:18] says in psalms 19 12 who can know who
[1:34:20] can understand his errors
[1:34:22] this is david now david understood oh i
[1:34:24] don't know me
[1:34:25] there's things inside of me i'm not even
[1:34:27] aware of but when i find myself in
[1:34:29] certain situations and places
[1:34:31] i see things come out to my surprise
[1:34:38] who can understand his errors cleanse
[1:34:40] down me he says from secret faults
[1:34:43] keep back thy servant also from
[1:34:45] presumptuous sins
[1:34:46] let not let them not have dominion over
[1:34:49] me
[1:34:50] then shall i be upright and i shall be
[1:34:52] innocent from the great transgression
[1:34:55] notice how he says this saints
[1:34:59] he says let the words of my mouth
[1:35:03] and the meditation of my heart
[1:35:06] be acceptable in thy sight
[1:35:10] not in my sight because i don't
[1:35:12] understand my own
[1:35:13] errors but in thy sight
[1:35:19] isn't that where the focus lies
[1:35:22] not how i look at somebody else's sight
[1:35:26] the lord in thy sight let the words of
[1:35:28] my mouth
[1:35:30] and the meditation of my heart be
[1:35:32] acceptable
[1:35:36] there's a place saints that god want to
[1:35:38] bring us up to
[1:35:42] i'ma share this one portion of this
[1:35:44] quotation with you
[1:35:48] brother branham was forewarned by god
[1:35:51] to be careful what he said he said satan
[1:35:54] has a trap set for you
[1:35:57] that trap involved other people
[1:36:01] a couple that god was uh was allowing to
[1:36:03] be anointed by
[1:36:04] demons they were already given to that
[1:36:07] lifestyle
[1:36:08] obviously but god let them feel the
[1:36:11] liberty to be able to come into that
[1:36:13] service at that time
[1:36:15] and in the service act out in a very
[1:36:17] wrong way
[1:36:20] and as i was considering this i realized
[1:36:23] you know they had deacons in that church
[1:36:27] they should have been put out right
[1:36:29] somebody should have slipped up in on
[1:36:31] that couple and say
[1:36:32] come on come on and they should have
[1:36:35] been gone
[1:36:36] but do you realize god didn't even let
[1:36:38] the deacons move
[1:36:41] you want to know why it was a
[1:36:42] predestinated trial
[1:36:46] it was something that god had
[1:36:48] established he he listened
[1:36:50] it was purpose by god for it to happen
[1:36:52] and here they come in a
[1:36:54] service and listen brother branham
[1:36:57] sitting there preaching
[1:36:58] and they're acting out and he sees he
[1:37:01] says please
[1:37:02] don't do that in church he goes as far
[1:37:05] as saying if you want to make love to
[1:37:06] the young lady go please go out
[1:37:09] and i notice how he was talking he
[1:37:11] wasn't fussing
[1:37:13] you see because the devil wanted him to
[1:37:15] get into another spirit
[1:37:16] watch this he's asking calmly
[1:37:20] he's asking calmly he said and it got to
[1:37:22] a point where something came to him and
[1:37:24] said
[1:37:25] ask what you will
[1:37:28] if you say blindness they'll be blind
[1:37:32] if you say death they'll take them out
[1:37:35] of here dead
[1:37:36] ask what you will
[1:37:40] but prior to the trial the lord told him
[1:37:42] be careful what you say
[1:37:45] now by how they were acting that was
[1:37:47] very provoking
[1:37:49] especially to a minister children wasn't
[1:37:52] there
[1:37:53] huh disrupting the service of god
[1:37:57] so now he's standing there and the lord
[1:37:59] has said what he said
[1:38:00] and it was in his mouth he had the
[1:38:03] listen
[1:38:04] god said whatever you say
[1:38:07] why are you going over this brother
[1:38:08] mcbride because i said we're out of
[1:38:09] place right now
[1:38:11] worldwide we can see the conditionings
[1:38:13] getting ripe
[1:38:15] is getting ripe isn't that right china
[1:38:18] is getting ripe
[1:38:20] the world stage is getting right the
[1:38:22] weather patterns are getting ripe
[1:38:24] the people the conditions among the
[1:38:25] people are getting right
[1:38:27] the conditions among the churches
[1:38:29] massive churches
[1:38:30] it's getting ripe in his right place
[1:38:34] everything is falling in his place right
[1:38:37] but the church is getting ripe
[1:38:40] it's a uniting time the church is
[1:38:44] becoming one with her lord
[1:38:47] there is a power a third pool
[1:38:51] which involves the that union that
[1:38:53] oneness the third pool is nothing more
[1:38:55] than the oneness between christ and his
[1:38:57] church
[1:38:58] is the person of god in full control
[1:39:02] not us speaking our mind but god having
[1:39:05] the control to bridle our tongue
[1:39:08] the bride of our whole body subject to
[1:39:12] jesus christ
[1:39:13] and now we're walking as he walked he
[1:39:15] said i do nothing except my father show
[1:39:17] me first
[1:39:21] and here it is god knowing and it's time
[1:39:23] now for this ministry to be introduced
[1:39:25] to his prophet
[1:39:27] he let that stage be said and he said
[1:39:29] it's in your hands now whatever you say
[1:39:32] and the prophet he sat there like a
[1:39:34] child he was like lord i don't know what
[1:39:36] to say what shall i say what shall i say
[1:39:38] what and that was the right frame of
[1:39:40] mind he was to be in
[1:39:42] because right when he didn't know it god
[1:39:44] came right down he said i found myself
[1:39:47] saying i forgive you of your act
[1:39:53] who was that that was god almighty god
[1:39:57] who who angels were even dirty in his
[1:39:58] sight
[1:40:00] a couple acted immorally in his service
[1:40:03] and god's mind toward that couple was
[1:40:06] i forgive you what about when people
[1:40:09] have issues in the church and people
[1:40:11] hear about it
[1:40:14] they get to talking about people oh you
[1:40:16] know so and so look at so and so and so
[1:40:18] and so and so and so
[1:40:20] where's the heart of god at just because
[1:40:23] we're in church and they're not are we
[1:40:25] seemingly not having issues but how many
[1:40:27] realize all of us got issues
[1:40:29] you might not be having the same issue
[1:40:31] with somebody else but you got issues
[1:40:33] that's equal
[1:40:40] then he said i must have said the right
[1:40:41] thing watch this now
[1:40:50] he says and it must have been just the
[1:40:51] right thing to say it was god
[1:40:53] trying a reaction to an action
[1:40:58] so you mean to tell me god will allow
[1:41:00] people to come to you and do things to
[1:41:02] you and provoke you
[1:41:05] just to try your reaction to an action
[1:41:09] but please understand this right here
[1:41:12] god was actually introducing this new
[1:41:14] ministry to his prophet
[1:41:17] this was the stage that god used to
[1:41:19] bring him higher
[1:41:22] for him to be tried in his speech
[1:41:27] to display how much he had grown
[1:41:30] in the things of god
[1:41:34] ah you can start playing brother i'm
[1:41:37] getting ready to wind this thing all the
[1:41:38] way down
[1:41:41] he says it was god trying a reaction on
[1:41:43] an action he says that night it was
[1:41:45] revealed to me that i
[1:41:46] said the right thing i know it was i
[1:41:49] know it was
[1:41:49] all leading to something but what was it
[1:41:52] what to do
[1:41:53] he says you know you have to watch that
[1:41:56] divine gift what you do with it
[1:41:58] remember what moses did so i must have
[1:42:01] said the right thing i forgive you
[1:42:03] for he says for you know john young john
[1:42:05] wanted to burn up samaria one time
[1:42:07] because they wouldn't feed them
[1:42:09] jesus said you don't know what kind of
[1:42:11] spirit you are
[1:42:12] the son of man came to save life not
[1:42:14] destroyed
[1:42:15] them scriptures just keep pouring over
[1:42:17] all night
[1:42:18] i didn't sleep he says but that was a
[1:42:21] trap set
[1:42:21] that satan would get me all worked up
[1:42:24] and then make me
[1:42:26] say the wrong thing
[1:42:30] you may have somebody that seems to be
[1:42:32] contentious in your life
[1:42:34] very argumentative you may even find
[1:42:37] yourself being like that at times
[1:42:41] if you find that you're that that you
[1:42:43] are the one that's being very
[1:42:44] argumentative
[1:42:45] and being provoking you you got to be
[1:42:47] able to be open with yourself
[1:42:49] who knows their own errors
[1:42:52] that's just how i am brother it needs to
[1:42:54] go
[1:43:01] satan trying to get us worked up to say
[1:43:03] the wrong thing to get us in the wrong
[1:43:04] spirit
[1:43:05] to cause the dove to lift up to lift off
[1:43:08] of us
[1:43:09] we need him we need to stay humble
[1:43:12] submissive
[1:43:13] isn't that right by his grace
[1:43:17] but notice this now he says don't you
[1:43:19] fear church of god
[1:43:20] i know you've got a lot of scruples
[1:43:22] among you you've got
[1:43:24] a lot of upsets and down and down sets
[1:43:26] and everything else
[1:43:27] but still you are the church of the
[1:43:29] living god do you believe that
[1:43:31] amen he said still you are the church of
[1:43:33] the living god by the grace of god you
[1:43:35] are
[1:43:36] no matter what you've done or how you've
[1:43:38] done god forgive you of your sins
[1:43:40] he wants a consecration i believe that
[1:43:44] the church of the living god is moving
[1:43:46] into a sphere i believe that
[1:43:48] no matter how you feel right now what
[1:43:50] you think of how you see things i
[1:43:52] believe this is happening right now
[1:43:53] among us
[1:43:54] this morning i believe is moving he says
[1:43:56] i believe that the church of the living
[1:43:58] god is moving into a sphere
[1:44:00] now that's going to shake the whole
[1:44:01] world that's the first time it's been
[1:44:04] since the days of jesus
[1:44:06] of nazareth to a human being talking
[1:44:08] about sister had it right
[1:44:09] ask what you will and it shall be given
[1:44:11] you anything you desire
[1:44:13] don't you see the words of jesus being
[1:44:15] fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass
[1:44:17] pretty soon
[1:44:18] i'm looking forward to happen in this
[1:44:21] meeting i'm i'm wanting to see
[1:44:23] i'm wanting it to happen now he says
[1:44:25] that that anointing will strike the
[1:44:27] whole
[1:44:27] church of the living god and she'll rise
[1:44:29] to her feet like a mighty marching army
[1:44:32] the sick will be healed by a word
[1:44:35] amen i'm talking about you now the sick
[1:44:38] will be healed by a word
[1:44:39] the blind will see the death will hear
[1:44:42] the dead will be raised up
[1:44:43] and the power of god will shake the
[1:44:45] world with the church of the living god
[1:44:47] we're in the process of it now
[1:44:50] i believe it's soon coming to pass i
[1:44:52] believe it will be just
[1:44:53] exactly like that i believe i believe
[1:44:56] it's going to strike the church of god
[1:44:58] soon and it's going to start a revival
[1:45:00] that'll shake the world
[1:45:04] things are not dying down saints things
[1:45:07] are just getting started
[1:45:09] there's a squeeze that's coming huh
[1:45:12] there's a religious persecution that's
[1:45:14] coming and guess what god is getting us
[1:45:17] ready
[1:45:21] so i pray that we'll pray for one
[1:45:24] another
[1:45:25] because we all need it amen
[1:45:28] i need it we all need it god is among us
[1:45:32] saints
[1:45:33] whether you feel him or not
[1:45:36] i want to make sure that's clear whether
[1:45:38] you feel him or not
[1:45:40] he's still here and he's still moving
[1:45:44] what is he looking for what is he
[1:45:45] calling for a deeper consecration
[1:45:50] without the raising of hands how many of
[1:45:52] us know we need a better prayer life
[1:45:55] many times our failure to respond to
[1:45:58] situations right
[1:45:59] is due to us not being in that sweet
[1:46:01] place
[1:46:04] when we pray and we spend time with god
[1:46:06] like we need two saints there is an
[1:46:08] anointing that that's just upon us
[1:46:10] i know you've noticed it whenever you
[1:46:12] got those times where god has had you in
[1:46:14] that place
[1:46:15] you can come in contact with anything
[1:46:17] amen and this your mind is in a whole
[1:46:19] nother place it's in another realm
[1:46:23] you're more peaceful more relaxed
[1:46:26] more passive but when we fail to give
[1:46:30] time to those important
[1:46:32] ingredients of our daily lives that we
[1:46:34] should be incorporating amen
[1:46:36] we see something that we see a sharpness
[1:46:38] or edginess
[1:46:41] more able to just let your thoughts go
[1:46:44] you ain't you ain't thinking about
[1:46:45] taking no thought in captivity
[1:46:49] thought's just been led out of jail and
[1:46:52] running all over the place
[1:46:54] amen hey man but we're drawing down to
[1:46:58] that real place things that real union
[1:47:00] that real oneness that's where i
[1:47:02] am right now that's what i feel like god
[1:47:03] is doing i'm not where i need to be
[1:47:06] i i'll say by a long shot but i thank
[1:47:09] god for the things he allowed to be
[1:47:10] spoken in the message
[1:47:11] because brother branham said i believe
[1:47:13] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:47:15] that sometimes god will allow things to
[1:47:17] seem a million miles away
[1:47:20] that's a long distance isn't it he said
[1:47:23] and then in a moment
[1:47:24] bring it to pass
[1:47:30] can we say praise the lord to that
[1:47:33] have faith in god church god bless you
[1:47:36] amen
[1:47:37] [Applause]

[1:47:48] of god just been ministering as he would
[1:47:50] have for me to minister

[1:47:54] don't know if i just get so wound up and
[1:47:56] caught up or whatever i know but i
[1:47:57] forget to pray
[1:47:59] and i go back in the back and i was like
[1:48:01] lord i forgot why i forgot to pray
[1:48:05] we ain't bound to a program like that
