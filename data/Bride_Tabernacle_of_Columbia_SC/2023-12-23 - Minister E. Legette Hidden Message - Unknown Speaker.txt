love you we appreciate you and for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen want look at the Book of Luke by the grace of God Luke the 10th chapter and read from two places Luke 10 and and then we'll go over to 1 Corinthians 2 by the grace of God Luke 10 and we'll begin here at the at the 13th verse if you got it say Amen Luke 10:13 and it reads woe unto thee corrosion woe unto thee Bethesda Betha for if the mighty Works had been done in tyan Saturn which had been done in you they had a great while ago repentant repentant sitting in cclo and Ashes but it shall be more tolerable for t and sidon at the Judgment then for you and thou cernium which art exalted in heaven shall be thrust down to hell he that heareth you heareth me and he that despises you despises me and he that despises me despises him that sent me you may be seated read down a little further and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give you behold I give you give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed for so it seem good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him we want to turn over to 1 Corinthians 2 and 6 got it say amen that's 1 Corinthians 2 and6 and it reads how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of of the world this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God have ordained before the before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of men the things that God which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God no man knoweth knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we haveed not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we may we might know the things that are freely given to us of God may God a blessed reading of his word just for a moment tonight by the grace of God I want to minister on a little something the Lord put on my heart and I entitled it hidden messages amen hidden messages you know it was something that Jesus over in Luke was saying you know he was uh calling out to the cities woe unto them he was saying unto them if the great things that's done unto you had been done unto Sodom and all all these other cities he said they would have repented but you see the thing you seeing things they haven't seen and yet you still won't repent he was saying W unto them but then he be to you know the disciples at that time 70 of them came back rejoicing because the Devils were subject to them but he was saying unto them Rejoice not because the devil's subject to you but Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and then I like how the Bible says he you know in his Spirit began to with joy began to rejoice in the spirit he been saying he was saying Lord thank you because you know you hid these things from the wise but you revealed them unto babes and you know so then you know we we we see that you know even though the mighty works and the things were happening you know in the midst of the people and it's always been that way you know people can look right at it look right at the signs and W look right at the scriptures being fulfilled look right at prophecy look right at it and still don't understand it still don't don't believe it they don't either don't believe it or they can read the Bible come to church every day and it happens right before them but they miss it when it happened but God reveals it to a special group of people and that is his select so I thank God today you know sometimes you know I look at I I said hidden messages because you know I was looking at some things and I said a hidden message is isn't is is when you're looking at a hidden message is is not what it meant to appear what it really is a lot of times you look at something and you know it appears a certain way but it's got you know a hidden a hidden message behind it it's got a hidden message behind it so you can't really see it and that's what you know all throughout the the ages the the the the the church world or the the the priest and stuff of that day reading the scriptures and all but it was veiled to him they reading it but you know we know that God he Reveals His Secrets the hidden things the mystery the the hidden things he reveals them the word come to the prophets he reveals the secrets to the servant of prophets and so the prophets them being able to look at the hidden look at the hidden things of God and bring them to the people but even though they might bring them to the people and preach it it's still you know uh people might be following the ministry following all that but still can't see it because as Paul was saying you know it's got to be the spirit in you that revealed that reveal the things so a lot of people can be following quoting even what the the prophet has said and all those things but yet they have no Revelation those those Pharisees and Sadducees and all even in that day they were quoting the scriptures Moses and Abraham and all these things but yet the the very word was manifest before them and they couldn't see who it was even John the Baptist they said are you the one he said no I'm just the voice of one crying in the wilderness now no doubt they was they could read the Bible see it and see uh the prophecy coming and and how uh the prophecy of the Forerunner to come but yet and even when John told him who he was they still was confused at who he was because in reading the Scriptures it was still hidden to them it was still veiled but but it took God God has to take a a a special group of people I say a special group because they're are his elect they're the they're his chosen group that out of out a a a group out of though many are called but few are chosen out of the whole group it's only a Chosen Few that's going to actually see it for what it is look be able to look at it and and and I I know it's it'd be kind of long if I try to go over everything but I just kind of just go over a little bit tonight but I said what it is because you know we can look at it from two ways you know I was looking at this hidden messages I I and I was looking at some of the simple things it just caught my attention where they was looking at or they was showing you certain logos you know from companies or certain uh things you know that that that they project but they were showing you the hidden messages behind those logos you know and all of them aren't saying like demonic but it's certain it's it's certain like they was talking about basking Robins Amazon pointing out just little things in their logo that wasn't by coincidence Apple but this was engineers and people like that that were gifted got together and they were able to design a certain thing that when you saw it it's certain things that was fed into your spirit without you even knowing things that and they gifted to do that they have teens that do these things so and then I begin to looking at that and I said you know that that's just on the on the simple scale so I got to really looking in into it more and I know we've heard it many of times but they were saying hidden messages can not only be visual but you know in audio and they showed how people uh uh devis lyrics in songs and you might say cu the music is good the music sounds good but the words make no sense when they sing in the the the the lyrics of the song they just look like they just throwing sentence together but it's the music the music is so good you listen to the music but the the words itself make no sense but a lot of it is hidden messages behind it they were saying how how it's I forget what they call it but you can take it and slow it down and play it backwards and they pointed several songs that this is what they're saying this is what they're saying hidden messages and what it would do they was saying you know by by um you know uh looking at it looking at it they could see how certain people would go out and there one song about one song it they was saying it had nothing to do with smoking marijuana but behind the hidden message was uh I feel good smoking marijuana or something like that and it it was a study that you know people would start smoking marijuana people would have things in their Spirit they would they didn't know but it was a hidden message behind it so you know I got to looking at and and and looking at this thing I said you know it it it's real scary it is because that that's just on a small scale but you might say oh people don't do that or they ain't it was just coincidence this is this is a coincidence they have teens and things that do this the people that get you to go out and buy stuff get you to go out and do stuff those are just hidden hidden like I call them hidden messages behind that and then you wonder you don't you don't know but you unwillingly the television internet all those things you unwillingly uh uh uh receiving things into your spirit you don't know what's wrong with you you don't know why you got certain Cravings certain desires spirit all throw off you can't get a prayer through can't get this because of the hidden messages because of the things that's back there and and and you know we living we're living living in a perverted World we're living in a world where the people that's doing these things they're they are perverted they're not saved they got hidden messages hidden agendas because of perversion in their life some they they create like the Bible says and the Bible Can't Fail that's why the Bible say to be they'll be maker of evil things creator of of evil things you know all that when they talk about the repivate mind and all because that's what that's what the word is going to so we can't get away from the scriptures the these you look at certain things people were perverted that created that people were perverted that came up with that idea oh and it looked like it might help Millions thousands Mass but the person that created it got some something backwards some perversion behind it right so I says but what it is it's it's and that's what the world we live in we'll go in we'll go into things follow after things run behind things not knowing what the what the foundation of it is what the background what what's all behind it that's that's the way the world is going today but I said you know hidden messages we we find that and like I said you you don't uh you don't want to believe it sometimes but I say to the full extent you know we'll we'll never know never know to the full extent of what to the depths that the people are going to the companies are going to the organizations we'll never know to the full extent of what they going to but it that's why I was I was praying last night even studying this I said Lord it's going to take the Holy Ghost in This Hour to divide between the right and the wrong like it said to be so close to deceive the very elect but the elect can't be deceived it's going to take I like how Paul was saying uh here in the um scriptures he was saying how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect perfect it's going to take the Holy Ghost it's going to take like it says you you uh uh make obtaining that Perfection but he said we speak it among them the rest of the world can't see it the rest of the world can't understand because it's hidden to them this is hidden wisdom this is hidden wisdom they hearing it but they can't they have eyes but they can't see it they got ears but they can't hear it they read the same Bible you read come to the same uhhh Fellowship you come to do the same thing but yet they can't see it yet it's not reaching them they reading the same books but they ain't hearing the voice you hearing they ain't seeing the hidden message that you seeing you know I know the prophet of God I was looking at something he was in in desperation and how he was saying these things that were hidden he was and he talking about the seals and how God revealed them he says that that out the right now that the things that God has revealed that was hidden he said that out to throw the whole church world into desperation right now because it it should have showed you just how close we are to the coming of the Lord it exposed Satan and who he is and the plan so that should have throw the whole church World in desperation everybody should have been on their knees wanting to get closer to God he said but it didn't reason why it didn't because even though it was revealed and people say oh the Seal's been revealed and all those things but yet it's still hidden to them why because by intellectual knowledge you can never understand it it takes like he says no man ain't going to know it but except for the spirit the spirit got Jesus said nobody no man ain't know the father but the son no man don't know he said but who the son reveal unto him so even though you had all those walking around Jesus and they didn't know who he was still doubting still you know all this things because if they did they would have never sh him but just like here in the scriptures he said had they known they wouldn't have crucified him he worked all the Miracles they saw the it was Dove tell together scriptures coming but they couldn't see it because it was hidden it was hidden from them you know but I thank God today just as it was then it was it's always been that way you look at throughout all the scriptures it's always been that way God sends a word sends a opens the the scriptures and reveal the word for your day and a lot of the people rally around it come out but yet they don't see they they perish they still stumble they still why they rallied behind sometimes the signs and the Wonders they rall behind the good time they rall behind you know uh uh just something something new but really getting down to it I and I get all over myself I says you know today I said it's hard it's hard today to to find to find the people you know uh that really really want to really want to want to know what God has for want them to do really want to know what their purpose is and in in the kingdom of God is a lot of times you know you get saved people get saved and all they happy they're rejoicing the Lord saved them brought them out of a bad condition or whatever condition they in and they worshiping the Lord But as time go on things get easy look like the devil let up then they it's like they just go through the motion you just go through the motion then come to church you know day in day out you just going through the motion but really to have a burden in your heart to to find out what the purpose that God saved you for to find out Lord what what am I what what part am I to play in the kingdom of God you know we are we are a house we're we're the house of God and fitly framed together God is God has fitly framed us together to make up the house of God you got a you when you saying fitly frame every block ain't the same you got a part you got to play God didn't just save you for not but you got a position God saved you for something so I says Lord where where are the people that that's really looking not just to say going to church not just because of our Duty or or just to goal just per form of fashion but the the people that really look and say God like Paul says what will you have me to do Lord what part do you want me to play Not only that God where where do you want me to be at a lot of times you say like you say that you know I don't I don't know about you but I want to know where where are we in time I want to know you know uh oh where are where are we where where what what's next Lord what what is what what am I to be under expectation for we know that we say we know that course scripture and all the things but I want to say Lord the Lord has got to reveal to you it'll cause your life to change it'll cause your walk to change it'll cause your your appetite your daily it'll cause everything to change because you want to find your place you want to find your place your place your position and that's for every individual not just in the ministry but every individual God saved you for a purpose you want to find out what that purpose is but I says you know we find that a lot of times and like I says you know we when we talking about those hidden when we talking about those hidden messages it could go both ways we're looking at how you know uh uh in the word like I said people reading read the word but in inside of the word is some things hidden in there that God want to reveal to you that you are are not just you're not just like like was reading the other day you're not like them you're not just an ordinary group but you are the bride of Christ you are called out God has called you out come on to take the Rapture God has called you out to be the difference may God has called you out as the elect and so you got to you can't be like them you got a part you got to play you got a position that God has called you to but how many are really seeking that how many are really looking you know and really praying for what the will of God is for their life you know I certain things dawned on me when I was uh looking at but I says really praying because the devil can get you all throw off but really praying for what the will of God is for your life and what because you said Lord things are happening so fast things are moving moving so fast god I want to be in your will what is your will where do you want me at what do you want me doing what what my role God where do you want me that's where I want to be at what's next what am I looking for come on but many of people as as I like I said this it would be kind of long to try to go over over it all but many many people don't look for prophecy they just look for good sermons good jump shout God going to bless you but prophecy prophecy being fulfilled prophecy of your day prophecy they don't look for that a lot of times they just want to just but you know it it's times you know I can see them going all those years you know and and the lamp of God went out but then all of a sudden Samuel came God spoke I mean God spoke to Samuel didn't he all right now it's no time we're just going in and out things about to change word is being fulfill now I come to open the book all through the scriptures you find that so it say okay you know the Prophet come he come and he gone now we're going on and on but it's still a happening what are you looking for what are you waiting what is a sign what are you what are you seeking after Hallelujah but I I begin looking at that I say but what it is people say we thought it was going to come but it but you know you missed it it was right there among you right there saw it but you couldn't see it why because it was a hit it was hidden to you Hallelujah but when when the word is revealed to you when God in your spirit begins to do something the Bible becomes a new book you can't you can't stay away from the word because it's something in there that draws you to it life is in it you can read the word and just be intellectual and don't do you no good but when when the Holy Ghost will begin to reveal things to you of of where you are in time you just start I was sharing with Charlotte last night I was saying you know sometimes you know you could do a lot of study study studying but that ain't nothing like the Holy Ghost just dropping things on you I says you can't explain that that's what I was sharing with Charlotte last night you can't explain you can do a lot of study study studying and people can show you how much they study cuz they can you know however they do it but I says it's nothing more precious than you can be walking along and it happens all the time or just going about your daily and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost just drops things in your spirit and scriptures start coming together and then you take that and you begin to write it down sometimes or you stop what you're doing and begin searching the scriptures and it be just as what the Holy Ghost revealed to you then you take it you know and see what see what the prophet of God was saying about it but what it and then all of it seems to come together but it's nothing more that that's what I says that I was sharing with Charlotte last night for a while talking to her I said that's the that's the thing that we love that God because why God do does certain things and it's not out of season God is always in season he's he's not out of season he's always when when when the Holy Ghost is revealing something or or saying something he's always in season why because he already knows what's going to happen tomorrow he already knows what's coming up the road so he begins putting things your spirit revealing things to you or you might be about to make a decision and the Holy Ghost comes by and he drops things in your spirit and tells you to stay away from it leave it alone you might not understand why but what it is you you you learn uh how how to be in tune with God you learn the voice of God you learn when God is speaking to you and you learn to obey it too you from at one point of time early in your Christian Journey you might have didn't always obey it but you learned how to obey it you learned to obey it because of the things you suffered for not obeying it sometimes but you count it as a blessing that's what I don't know I said that's what I look for you know it's been many of times but I says you know it it's it's hidden like was saying hidden message out I can't go over scripture scripture like I want to cuz it's just the Friday night but I was thinking I was like you know uh I tell a little testimony I don't know if I told it here but at work once you know was going through the day and it's having having a little rough day and everybody's telling me Ernest man you you've been uneasy today cuz it was breakdown after breakdown machines and hard problems hard hard situations erest you you you you need to get the devil off your back so one of the guys he said Ernest what is that what's that on your back he said you got a a three-headed uh three-headed uh wolf on your back a three-headed wolf and I said man you know I thought they was just joking around but he said no and I took the vest off off I just got the vest out of the machine at work took the vest off it was an emblem with a three-headed wolf on it and had a long tail and I was like man I was like what in the world I I ripped it off but in the in the sticker in the sticker it was a three-headed wolf I I said what y'all trying to do out here so the plant manager come in I said man what y'all selling in that machine and then one of the young guys he's 20 20 or 21 years old Ernest when he came to work you don't know what that is I said what he said man come on you you uh uh love history and and and and and uh Greek mythology and and and all this thing cuz you know talk about the Bible and stuff but get Greek mythology yall mixed up with that that's what you know some people do but I he said you don't know what that is I said what he says that's so and so he said he he's the one that guards the entrance to the gates of hell I said wow and if somebody else came in and said yeah you ain't never I for get what the name of it is I start to look them up but I said I ain't want to get into that I'm not even going to bother I'll just take their word for it they say yeah they that he guards some creature that guards the the gate to the entry of the Gates of Hell to certain a certain real in hell so I said Lord I I took the whole vest and threw it in the trash so the plant manager he's he he he come out there he's like Ernest I heard about what you doing what you saying he went and got it out of the out of of the trash he's sitting there holding he says I don't feel no different he said I don't I don't and I said yeah I said see I be talked to him a little bit I said see everybody thinking these people didn't just create these things or just imagine these things right I said these creatures and all I said but one day I hope you be on the other side but one day you going to find out these things weren fairy tale one day you gonna find out I was telling them at work they ain't imagining I said you think these people just go on these these these Hollywood people just imagining these people demon possessed they seeing things in reals and they bringing them back to us and showing you what they seeing over there everybody laugh Earnest I know you don't believe that I said one day you'll see it one day you'll understand that that it ain't it ain't no joke right so we had a couple of the The Other Guys in there they were was with me on it but that's that's probably cuz they've been raised by their grandma or somewhere down in in you know somewhere in the South put it that way and they believe in those spirits and stuff that but I says that what it is what was the purpose of of of whoever created this vest for you to wear a safety vest to put that emblem on there you say what what's the purpose of that being the logo of your company come on and that's just a safety vest imagine all the clothes we wear the certain things you know he says but what it is that's just on and I said that's just the tip of it that's just a tip I said God it's going to take the Holy Ghost exposing things revealing things to us unwillingly things get in your spirit unwillingly things happen but God got to do something in our lives but just as the world is using that in in in that realm they using that but God you look at his word even the spiritual people they can't see it why because it's hidden to them ain't it but and it takes a a a gifted person it takes an elected person it takes a Spirit-filled man to be able to look and see what the hidden message is and I thank God today that that you and I he has chosen us not by our our own choosing but God has chosen us like Paul was saying before the foundation of the world before the world God chose us in him I'm glad that God did that and I'm glad that he desired like he says to hide it from the wise and reveal it to the bab such as would learn I'm he thank God for that because he said no man ain't going to know itless L the father L I let the son reveal him no man ain't going to know it God got to reveal it God got to do these things why because they hidden God got to do these things it's more than just coming to church it's more than just singing It's more than just getting happy and just oh God saved me I got a great testimony he brought me from a mighty long way he did but it's more than that it's going on to Perfection it's it's I I was preaching here the last several weeks I've been saying and I said many people going to die and not make it with a powerful testimony you don't think the children of Israel they had a real powerful testimony didn't they how God brought them out out of Egypt through the Red Sea and all that but they didn't make it over they didn't cross over did they they died in the wilderness because of unbelief they made it out but they didn't never go in and they we've been given that warning today right God has called you come out of her whether it's come out of the the organization or come out of the world anyway you came out didn't you but you got to go in you got to go in you got to go your soul got to be hungry to go in behind the veil go into that place God I came out and I thank you for bringing me out I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world but God I want to get closer to you I want to go be I need to that that to be your your your desire take me behind the veil God let me be in that place where I ain't affected by the W the rain the wind the weather take me in that place and let me stay in there let me remain in that place because some storms are coming out they're coming fires are coming floods are coming storms are coming out but behind the veil the glory of God is back there you don't know whether what's going on on the outside because you in there where the glory of God is and in there is righteousness peace and joy every day in there there's hidden manner come on people reading the book but they can't they this is hidden manner that we eating we reading they say we reading the same Bible yeah but we we eating the same word yeah but we eating the hidden manner you behind the veil that's where you eating that behind the veil behind that that Mana don't get old that Mana don't get stale that Mana don't get worms in it but back there that manner is fresh every day that's why you can't help but to stay in it you got to you you can't help but to stay in it you can't help but to read your Bible you can't help but to pray you can't help because why it's fresh back there you love it it's it's new every morning but you know you find that I says where where are the people that's really seeking God what do you want God what is my position where are we you know you riding you might be riding down the road or your car GPS especially the children how long we got where are we are how much long have we got want to know you don't you don't never ride down the road and not know where you are are that's a bad feeling sometimes you may get that way but you you want to know where you at how long how you know God where am I at check me up come on search me search my heart David always had that Lord search my heart and try my Reigns why because he wanted to be right with God but you find today people they s coming in and up and out but I want to checkup come on I want a refilling I want a checkup I want it God check me up where am I am I fit am I ready Hallelujah am I I don't want to get out there in the battle and I ain't ready I thought I was ready but I ain't been I ain't trained enough come on those boxers those Fighters you know they trainer going to tell them you ain't ready you got to train a little harder you ain't ready to fight yet come on because why they already know what it takes for you to go out there and we stand the round somebody say I just going to knock him out the first round that might not come you might have to go five 10 Rounds they used to say that a lot about some of those Fighters getting there and used to knocking people out they might be 30 and 0 30 Knockouts first second round but they they mess around and fight somebody that's going to Bob and weave or can withstand a punch then they get to the fifth and sixth round it's going to be going to be rough on them ain't it because they a they ain't never fought that long they ain't trained it they thought they had no need they was you know sa I'm ready but they got into a fight that didn't that didn't go away right quick it was a long endured battle and they couldn't hold on to the end you look at that I say that in the natural but just looking at in a spiritual fight God check me up you know how God going to check you up through the man of God preaching through the word coming forth oh he shouldn't have said it that way he shouldn't but was it the Bible was it the word come on God God don't do nothing out of season does he so I say oh that was just him God don't say nothing how many people when Elijah come and prophesy ain't going to be no R oh that's just Elijah but after 6 months and a year they know it wasn't just Elijah then wasn't it after so many a long while go find him hunt him down he was the most Wanted Man on Earth probably at that time wasn't he cuz then they realized it wasn't just him was it come on God is so good to us I said hidden messages tonight I know it would be real long to try to even go you know where I want to go at but I said just think about that hidden messages come on it's on both sides I believe that [Applause] amen praise the Lord amen I was just looking back and seeing most of the mom and pop bookstores sold out to the big book stores because they had all the information and exposing what was going on thought about the little book let brother Ernest whole termo in the toy box and I guess you can't find it nowhere you been able to find it he said I'll bring it right back is those little messages the people used to come on the radio and and so forth and they used to teach about what's going on with the young people and um about the songs with the Beatles and all and they showed you that you can play it backwards and see how to be worship and Satan and calling on Satan and all of that and different ones they used to show all of that and show you how to check this out the the little advertisement on television to show all of that expose all of that stuff you don't hear those voices no more Jimmy schwier used to come on and preach about Mr Babylon and you know who it was Revelation 17 and all you don't hear that no more you see I'm going tell you something once you start exposing the devil you know I I had a uh what you call it one of those DVDs that uh let Brothers brother Jer saw it on on the Messi Mason showed how it was Witchcraft and the luciferian doctrine and and so forth you can't see that no more you start talking that kind of talk you're in trouble you know what I'm saying so to expose Lucifer and expose the devil in all those areas you you people almost you can't you start doing that you're in trouble are you with me so people a lot of times young people are in sorties and in these things they drawn up with that's why they call them the dogs and different things like that Q dog and this and that so they they they get into demon worship without even knowing they into that demon worship they get in you know what do you desire light the light that they talking about is Lucifer you know what I'm saying so a lot of things people get into they don't know that they're involved into they way up the road in it and locked in it till they become deceived in it and they think that they're doing because you can do good things you know we can do we can do some nice things like you know things that in the community things that would make society and life better but at the same time people don't know it's contr control Power things that control you things that bring you into subjection so by the grace of God we thank God now when they saw Jesus they called Jesus what Bible because even though he had the right spirit and he was actually delivering people but all the church world came against him because they say he was bezug because he was really exposing the deception I I believe there were good people people that mean the right thing and tried to do the right thing but at the same time Jesus came on the side on the on the scene they didn't want to believe that amen this Pharisee religion and this SED religion and all of these herodians and stuff like that they didn't want to believe that hey we're right we know we're right my father talking about my great granddaddy my granddaddy you know so actually they thought they were talking about the God that they were serving in the Bible that they had they thought that that's what uh Jesus was coming against them but he's actually coming against them because they do error not knowing the scripture though they read it though they believe supposed to believe it and I'm I'm saying they believed it but they were twisted and believ in it amen uh with a little twist to it and that's all the devil amen uh the the eve might have beli what God Said but Satan just Twisted a little bit nowed you should not die and that's all the devil has to do is just twist the word a little bit amen and people get just go on and the devil knows he got you if he can get you to dot one word that God said there one thing in the Bible the devil can twist you up with that's all he got to to keep you out of the Kingdom to keep you out of Heaven all he got to do is Twist you you up in one area so man should not live by bread alone but by every word we said the elect cannot be deceived why amen praise God said Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression isin't that right praise God you got to be in this the second atam last Adam you got to be in Jesus Christ in order not to be deceived the only way you won't be deceived you you amen you got to be in Christ praise God and he is the word are you with me so thank God for the word tonight praise God sometimes these sublim messages that's why you got to be careful how you hear and what you hear because those things are injected in your spirit we ought to feed on the word we ought to want that more than anything see because sometimes those things begin to come into our spirit man unconsciously unaware as he said certain men crept in unaware certain Spirits amen deceiving deceptic Spirits can get hold to you and you what without you even knowing that these Spirits are controlling your life demons out of the pits of hell they just wiggled themselves in and made you believe a lie and think it was the truth but they just wiggled themselves in unaware why it's because we didn't surrender all to God we didn't say God I want all I God I I want everything on your word Lord I want every I want to live right right I want to do right I want to I I I want to please you Lord you got to you got to it it's a lot of people don't come to that point that they want to go all the way 100% with God see sometime you know I was looking at that I said sometime people think that they they going to get at the end of the road I told my wife today I said people going to get out all the little scheming preachers know they ought to be sitting down somewhere in the corner I mean I I I don't count myself to be so this it's just by the grace of God I am what I am but people living a kind of crooked lives scheming for money and position and power and they're scheming and yet they're going to stand up before God and they GNA have to stand before God say I scheme I wanted to be a pastor because I want money I wanted to do this because I want wanted to be big and God going to look at your heart and he going to know that he going to know when you scheme he going to know amen every little trick and every little thing you pull to get what you got are you with me so in your heart he said well I'm innocent God going to Know You're Not Innocent you can't fool God you can't lie to God I know I had the right Spirit no you didn't you schemed you tricked and you made yourself believe that you were right when the word declared you to be wrong amen but I you you try to twist the word where could please you and justify your wrongdoing and a lot of folks have Justified themselves they just the Bible say deceivers and being deceive we deceive ourselves are you with me and I said one day I wouldn't want to face God knowing that I've schemed I scheme you know I don't want to scheme and get a whole lot of folks in the church and you sitting in the church because I done scheme you in and you on my side this ain't no side we ain't youing side if God didn't lead you and God didn't guide you oh no it's got to be God you and God lord I I want you I don't want no scheming no playing games I want the Holy Ghost and I want it real I don't want nothing else I want God you know I know I'm not the prophet of God but I I I think God for the little spirit that he gave give me you know what I'm saying to let me see things and sometime folks say you but Sim so so so I said Lord let you see something things and people think you can't see and you you blind and they they'll tell you uh well you this and you that I'm going to tell you something God with at the end of the road he's going to vindicate are you with me and you don't have to prove nothing to anybody anytime you find yourself trying to prove to somebody amen your godliness and how good you are how holy you are it it's something wrong Jesus said you go tell John what you saw you go back and you tell John come on follow me and you go back and tell him what you s are you with me let your life speak for itself amen don't never try to prove to Men Let Your Life speak for you the way you live what you stand for praise God sometimes you can stand and don't even open your mouth amen you ain't got to say nothing just folks feel condemned in your presence why because they know you're not of The Same Spirit some folk will a pat you on the back and tell you you all right just to for favor are you with me yeah and they'll point out all the fault in somebody else to justify amen yeah you can do what you do cuz uh you know brother Ernest got faults too and brother sister song got faults and uh you know and and so it makes you feel comfortable because the Bible said don't measure yourself you know you know don't look at others amen you got to stand before God they got to stand before God I don't know why I'm saying these things but it's really been in my spirit because sometimes there's spirits that come in and he said in the sublim Hidden Spirits they come in and they manipulate maneuver and people are actually subjected to spirits that they say wellow I'm going tell you anytime you find yourself got to compromise and got to make yourself feel like yeah it's all right and you know it ain't after a while you start believing it you start giving into it and you know you're wrong I pray God that that this year coming up that those Spirits be lifted and people that's Godly and want to live for God we giving their all I believe this is the the Lord spares this is the year of that God would expose spirits and this is the year that the hammer is going to fall God is really going to move if you ain't right get right cuz it's coming I don't know whether that was the right news that I saw it was talking about the some planes from yam went over and hit in Israel and I said and now might we pulling in the Muslim Nation into the wall and they telling them everybody to wish y'all Y restraint and let's try to get this a peaceful solution to stop the wall over there for this thing break out if it break out American trying to hold fast what what you going to do isra said we going

said I got to go some some got on my spirit and I'm G I'm g go to a certain place and try to get some of that old material and I'm hoping they got it all a lot of it anyway and where I can start showing y'all what and they said the children way back when we studyed back in the early 80s and in the 70s the children because of the computers and the games they were having seizures and in the different countries that I was in children was getting seizures so they ban different games because those games were giving the children seizures could your children get a hold of some of these games and stuff they give they they baned them over in China over in different countries a lot of those gam I had all of that information I had all of that stuff we should we should teach on that stuff and try to make the parents conscious and aware now everybody got all kind of games and so when the sicknesses and stuff the children start acting strange it's because of you know they it's demon powers these people are inspired to do these things and we I wish I had those those sisters that come out of Witchcraft they were they were telling you that people were doing those things to actually get you witches in charge of all of this Hollywood fashion witchcraft out of the pits of hell every everything everything is coming from that's why brother Ernest talking about the those things we should tell you about I'm going tell you something once you start exposing things like that you can't expose it on the internet you got to cut off the internet you know why I'm going tell you things start happening people start coming from their headquarters sitting in the church tell tell yourself people just was you know they were just talking about the material we had come out of books and with this message people thought the people were so stirred up and on fire with this message to people thought we was coming against these big companies and all but it wasn't that we just so they started checking you out I'm going tell you brothers and sisters you're going to be under serious attack if you really take a stand for God are you with me people going to look at you strange think you

demon power before they even become teenagers with all kind of gimmicks and gadgets and father even the educational system Lord God sometimes it's very destructive father I pray God that you give your people the spirit of wisdom and understanding that you put a hedge around about them to keep them keep their minds and keep their hearts don't let their Spirit get throwed off Lord but Lord that they
