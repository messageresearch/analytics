what happens when all the money runs out what happens when all your friends walk away and it feels like God is far away also look to your neighbor and say neighbor neighbor it's only temporary it's only temporary say neighbor neighbor but God is eternal but God is eternal when I think on the story of David and Goliath and how David was able to over overcome Goliath because it wasn't a problem that he was a giant oh it was a he was able in the eyes of God Goliath was just a small problem he knew that God already bought him through temporary situations before with the lion and the bear and he believed that God was going to do it again someone may ask me how do you know that God is real and I tell him I've seen him work time and time again in my life when I was in the dark and when I was deep in sin and I God told me it was only temporary but he is eternal always providing always saving always delivering and being a friend when no one else is how many want him to be with you always am please stand to your feet and if you want God to be with you always and not just temporary ask him to come into your heart today after the service we catch up with our money man let's listen in hey

amen if you have your Bibles tonight [Music] amen ask that you turn to the book of Lord Mercy the the book of mm second Corinthians that's it amen second Corinthians chapter 10 10 and verse three is where we'll start tonight amen if you got it say Amen amen and it reads for though we walk after In the Flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not conal but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all obedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen God bless your reading of this word you may be seated tonight amen amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little short topic that I entitled an invincible Army an invincible Army and as you read here in second Corinthians and it says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen sometimes every day you wake up it's a fight sometimes every day that you get out of your bed it's a struggle every day that you you get up and there's breath in your body you have something to fight it may not be my situation but you got your own and you realize that God has created us in such a way that we have an answer for every battle we have an answer for every fight that we face and God has created us into an invincible Army and I I looked up the the word invinci it says it's too powerful to be defeated or overcome see when God created you he created you in His image and God he said that he created his word that you would be able to feed every stronghold that may come against you every demon and devil that may come against you you'll be able to feat them with one thing God's word that's all you needed to defeat every devil that may come your way every sickness every disease that's all you needed was the word of God he went to Calvary to shed his blood but he put it in his word so that we can read it and be reminded of what he did he said if you the prophet of God said if you want to grow closer to him each and every day all you have to do is read your Bible and pray that's all you have to do cuz when you read your Bible you're reminded of what God has done you're reminded of how God far God has how many things he's given you and how many blessings he's given you see God's word is too powerful to be defeated it's Invincible it's the only thing that you can has tried and true and has been tested and it will always work no matter you can try many things but when you try God there's nothing else that you need need he said everything that I need he's already provided and he has created each and every one of us to be a part of this invincible Army that that's are God's troops as the young people said I'm a Christian Soldier marching on the war with the cross of Jesus going on before see God is creating You In His Image he's doing a thing that he's doing a work said the song says something on the inside is working on the outside and oh what a change in my life see when God changes you nobody can turn that around all it takes is one word and God can do the rest all you have to do is say Lord I Surrender and that's all you need to do God to show up and do everything else that you need and he will make you so that you will be invincible so when the Devil comes your way you said uh-uh I got something for you he said when the weakest Christian get on his knees when the weakest one you said maybe I ain't pray in a long time all it take is one prayer to change your life all it takes is one time you getting down on your knees and say Lord I need help Lord I I come before you it's not my sister not my brother not my mother or my father but Lord It's Me Oh Lord standing in the need of prayer and said God he gave us the greatest weapon which was his word and as long as you have faith in his word you cannot be defeated as long as you have faith in the Lord that I trust your word is true then you know that all things are possible you know that everything that you ever wanted is possible if you go to God and he said if you ask it shall be given to you but he said you don't get what you ask cuz you ask a miss so you got to ask for the right thing but I tell you you'll never go wrong if you say Lord I want your will to be done you'll never go wrong if you say Lord I want you to take control you'll never go wrong if you say Lord I want you to lead and guide me you'll never go wrong you'll be a part of that Invincible Army cuz God will be in you and God said I he has to receive his own see he he'll receive you because you you are in the image of him and in his likeness in Ephesians it says Ephesians chapter 6 and verse Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 it starts all says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil he said put on the whole armor see when you in this Army you got to put on something you got to put on this armor and that you may be able to stand against the wise of the devil see you won't stand otherwise you won't stand otherwise for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of darkness in this world against spiritual wickedness in high places see some of your battles ain't even people it ain't even your sister or your brother it's things that you cannot see it's things that are hidden from you unless God open your eyes to see like he did to Elijah servant you won't be able to see what you're fighting but you have to get down and said Lord you can take care of the battles that are unseen you can take care of the things that I cannot see and he said wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may may be able to withstand in the evil day how many know that we in an evil day it's evil everywhere that you turn and having done all to stand done all to stand stand therefore sometimes you got to take a stand I was working with a little thought and I called it compromise I said sometimes we get the situations where we compromise and said I ask you have you compromised but sometimes it says here you got to stand you got to take that stand you got to stand up and said I know what's right and I'm going to do what's right it's one thing to know it but it's another to do it see you got to follow it with some actions you might have been taught it all your life but you got to do something with it you said Lord I need you and see if you go to him he'll help you stand see it's not you standing by yourself said he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you always even to the ends of of the world see God will always be there right there with you that's why he told you to stand he wouldn't have told you to stand if he wasn't going to be there said there was said God will always be there with you he said stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the Blessed pray of righteousness and his feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace say sometimes when you walk into places you want peace but you got to have the gospel with you said Prat sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you may able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked said all you need is facei he said it'll be a shield for you said if you have the shield of Faith it'll quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God see with this sword you can defeat every devil with this sword you can walk into places that you never thought and God will give you dominion over them you can walk in there and say Lord I need peace in my workplace Lord I need peace in my school Lord I Want Your Presence to be with me but see you got to have God in you first you can't go into place and say I want peace and God ain't with you you got to have them in you amen and he said take to in the sword of the spirit which is a word of of of God in verse 18 He said praying always with prayer and supplication in the spirit that's how you get stronger each and every day it's praying always he said in the scripture one of the most powerful verses it's only three words he said pray without ceasing said you want to be a part of that Invincible Army are you praying are you are you getting to it and he said the reason I said I think about Jesus when he went and he was tempted he said the reason why the devil could not be defeat could not defeat Jesus was because he used the word see he he was a part of that Invincible Army and he had the tools to defeat the devil and he used the word and all he said was it is written said he he might not have known exactly where it said God knows all things but sometimes you may not know exactly where but if you can quote the scripture and say by your stripes I'm Healed I believe something that happened for you if you go around on your knees and say Lord by his stripes I'm Healed Lord your promise did not put more on me than I can bear I believe godov some things in your situations he said it is written that even death could not hold death couldn't hold him because it was written that death had to go away it was written that death would be defeated so everything that you think about and you go through it is written that God has given you the answer to he has given you the key to unlock lock every door he's giving you the key to walk out of situations that you thought you couldn't walk out of he's giving you the key to say by a strikes I'm here he's giving you the key of deliverance we have testimonies that can tell you what God has done we have testimonies and I look back even in my own life and I seen how God has allowed me to do allowed me to open doors for me I said I prayed a prayer this year and I seen I said many years ago and this is happened this year I prayed a prayer and I said Lord I I finished University and I said I'll only go back if it's it's somebody's paying for it I prayed that prayer and some people don't know the first time I went it was by a prayer when I told the Lord I got down on my knees I said Lord I don't have the money my parents don't but Lord you provide away well he did in end they paid me to go to school that was the first time so then I said well if God did it once can he do it again and I said sometimes you might pray the prayer and it take years to see the fruition of that said I went and I some things happened in my life and things changed and I said you know what I'm going to have a conversation about some information and when I went and talk to the person they said let me let me see what we can do for you and we can do for you and I went and I talked to them and they said well I was looking at one program and they said well let me see and I said I'm not doing it if it's not funded they said okay we understand and then God worked out a way that they found a scholarship to cover all my tuition for two years and see God is able to do exceedingly abundantly more than you can ever ask or think said when you you got to have faith in it though you got to when people tell you ah just go ahead and let somebody else pay for it or let this happen or let this happen you got to have faith and believe in what you prayed for and nobody can persuade you otherwise you got to believe that if you quote the scripture Lord by your strikes I'm heal I believe healing will happen you might have to wait on it but God he always has the right timing it's not your timing or your sister or your brother it's his timing and he knows exactly when to do it he said and that and that's what God is doing he's creating a people that will be an invincible Army said God's word it exposes Satan it revealing his Works attempt the destruction of God's people and and discrediting of God's word right down to the T to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire see he fights that he cannot understand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and and that she can do the Great Greater Works amen he promised that you would do Greater Works and he said she will be an invincible Army he said if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her so you got to understand who you are you got to understand what day and time that you're living in and you got to understand that once you have that understanding you can be an invincible Army you can be an invincible Army that can withstand all the Ws of the devil once you understand it and you can go into deeper and understand it that God has done greater he has done and given you the power to to withstand in this evil day you can you can go on and you can shout and you can thank God because you know where you stand it's not a mystery to you what where your name is written it's not a mystery to you will will you find out he said if he said in Acts 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and once you have the Holy Ghost he'll lead you to all truth he'll lead you into everything that you're supposed to know some people you got to you got to lay by the wayside because it wasn't meant for them you had to go on and say Lord I want what's for me Lord if you got it for me it said what God has for me it is for me so I can step on and be a part of this invincible Army cuz God created me to be this I it's not it's not out of my normal it's not something that I'm trying to put on it's who I am it's not something that I'm trying to be it's who I am see I I I can be a conqueror because God made me that way I can step in the room with Victory because God Made Me Victorious I can step in the room and say God is a provider because that's what he made himself to be to me say he might not have Prov provided but for you but he provided for me said he healed me when I was sick he was a lawyer as they said in the courtroom see some people have that testimony that God will get you out of situation when there is no help that God will do things that are unseen behind the scenes and people will speak for you when it when when when you thought they might have been your enemy see God will do the unthinkable because he's creating an invincible Army one that'll step forward and say by that a step forward and say God I know that all things are possible God I know that all things are possible say God I know that all things are possible if I only believe so are you believing tonight do you trust that God can do the impossible do you trust that God I don't know what you what your situation is or what you may go through but do you trust that God can do it God God can fix it God can turn it around and it may be just like the children was saying in your homes sometimes it takes the children to pray for parents sometimes it takes the children to pay for the grandparents to pay for the ones that they want to see saved it can start in you it can start in you it can start in you it doesn't have to be someone grown sometimes it's by the child that shows the leadership that shows the parents hey I got to get myself together cuz this child wants to go to church this child wants to be in the house of the Lord so I got to figure out a way to get there because they want to be there see I got to figure out a way to be on time to be early cuz they want to be there they're excited about what God is doing said are you excited about what God is doing see but when you get that hunger and thirst you you don't want to be there nobody is convincing you that you got to go nobody is telling you I got to go yeah we going to church uh we going to we got to go to church tonight see sometimes when when God has placed it in you that hunger and thirst and you become part of that Invincible Army you will be excited to go to church you want to go you're happy to go because God has done the work in your life and all you have to do is say Lord I Surrender and when you surrender sometimes he going to take you down paths that you didn't think you was going to go he going to take you places that you didn't think you was going to go and it's going to be because you said Lord not my will but yours be done and he going to put you in places that you never thought you would be and you might have said I don't even want to be there I'm one of those people when I was growing up I said I don't want to do that that's not for me but that's not is different when God has placed that calling in your life it's different when God has and said it doesn't matter what position it is if you are in your position it's valuable it's valuable you may said well I I I want to be this or this but if God got you here there's a reason God has each soldier in an army has his thing that he has to do everybody can't be on the front line everybody can't be in the back there's people in the middle everybody has a role that they have to play and it's only if the if the if everyone does their role correctly maybe you'll end up going out of there and being successful sometimes it's not cuz the enemy is too great but there's no enemy that's greater than that can that can go against God and win God has the answer and he has the key to unlock every door because you are a part of an invincible Army amen it was a song that came
