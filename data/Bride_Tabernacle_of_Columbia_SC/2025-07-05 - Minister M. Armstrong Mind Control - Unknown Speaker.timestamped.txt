[32:30] Beloved now we are
[32:35] the sons of God
[32:41] adopted by his blood. We've been
[32:46] redeemed.
[32:49] We've been
[32:52] made joiners with Jesus
[32:56] to reign as priests and kings.
[33:01] Tell me now, what do we say
[33:06] to these things?
[33:10] If God
[33:12] is
[33:14] for
[33:16] us,
[33:18] [Music]
[33:19] tell me now who can be
[33:23] against
[33:26] us.
[33:30] If God
[33:33] is
[33:34] on your side,
[33:40] how can you
[33:42] be denied?
[33:51] In all these
[33:55] things we are
[34:01] more than coner
[34:04] through Jesus
[34:07] Christ
[34:09] our Lord.

[34:15] nothing
[34:17] can say
[34:20] parade us
[34:22] from the love
[34:25] of God.
[34:30] We're told that God is working
[34:35] everything out for our God.
[34:40] If we love him, then we're called to do
[34:46] his will.
[34:48] And though the enemy tries to stop us,
[34:56] still the song our heart still sings.
[35:01] Tell me, what do we say
[35:06] to these things?
[35:09] If God is
[35:13] for
[35:15] us,
[35:19] tell me now who can be
[35:23] against
[35:25] us.
[35:29] If God
[35:32] is on
[35:35] our side,
[35:39] tell me now, how can we be denied?
[35:50] In all these
[35:54] things I am
[36:00] more than a coner
[36:03] through Jesus
[36:06] Christ
[36:08] my Lord.
[36:13] And
[36:15] nothing
[36:16] can say
[36:19] parade me
[36:22] and
[36:25] nothing
[36:27] can separate
[36:30] me
[36:32] from the love
[36:36] of God.

[43:53] here. They had some uh previous
[43:55] obligations that they had to commit to,
[43:57] but the Lord is here and we are grateful
[43:59] to be here. We appreciate Pastor
[44:00] Simmons. I know he's out today and
[44:02] appreciate the ministers, our brother
[44:04] Ernest and brother Caleb. Uh I am
[44:07] nervous so I'm going to jump right back
[44:09] right into the word of God here. Our
[44:10] pastor Palmer in the back. Amen. Let's
[44:13] give him a hand clap of praise. A
[44:14] brother I hold in very very high regard.
[44:17] He's a brother. I I just remember
[44:19] growing up and I remember when he had
[44:21] first married sister uh sister Palmer
[44:25] and we had been used to calling him
[44:27] brother Jeremiah.
[44:29] And I walked up. She probably don't
[44:30] remember this, but I walked up. I think
[44:31] they were engaged at this time. And I
[44:33] walked up to him and I said, "God bless
[44:34] you, Sister Palmer." No, Sister
[44:36] Jeremiah. That's what I said. God bless
[44:38] you, Sister Jeremiah. Cuz we had gotten
[44:40] so used to calling him that. My mom, she
[44:42] said, "Brother Matias, no, that's Sister
[44:44] Palmer now. that brother Jeremiah is his
[44:46] first name. So, we're glad to have them
[44:48] in the house. Good to see, brother Josh.
[44:51] I saw him outside. Good to see you, man.
[44:53] Amen. Let's jump right into the word
[44:55] here. 1 Peter chapter 5:8. I won't be
[44:57] before you long. I just want to share a
[44:59] few few thoughts here, uh, that I have
[45:02] been kind of meditating on here in the
[45:03] past few weeks. I've shared it with the
[45:04] church, uh, the home church, and
[45:07] hopefully it can be a blessing to you on
[45:08] tonight. Amen. 1 Peter chapter 5 and
[45:11] we'll start reading at verse
[45:14] verse 8.
[45:17] It says very familiar passage says be
[45:19] sober, be vigilant because your
[45:22] adversary who the devil, how many the
[45:25] devil don't care how old you are, how
[45:26] sick you are, how young you are, he's
[45:29] going to be your adversary. Amen. To
[45:31] Jesus come or to death do you part? He's
[45:34] your adversary. So Peter is telling us
[45:36] here be sober and be vigilant. That
[45:39] means stay spiritually alert and always
[45:43] stay watchful and be ready. Amen. He
[45:47] says because the devil as a roaring lion
[45:49] walketh about. This is not some past
[45:52] tense thing to where the devil walks
[45:53] today and then takes the rest tomorrow.
[45:55] How know he don't take no vacation.
[45:57] Amen. He don't take no PTO. Matter of
[46:00] fact, we take more vacation than he do.
[46:02] Amen.
[46:04] We feel like I had a good day at church
[46:05] Sunday morning. So, I'mma get out here
[46:07] and enjoy myself. And the devil be that
[46:09] right there waiting.
[46:11] So, he says he's walketh about right
[46:13] now. He's walking around thinking of
[46:16] what ways can I trip brother Matias up.
[46:18] Amen.
[46:20] Walkth seeking whom he may devour. Let's
[46:23] turn to um
[46:26] 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter
[46:29] 10:4-5.
[46:30] You know, I think about Jesus on Mount
[46:32] Transfiguration. Bible says he took
[46:34] Peter and James and John up the mountain
[46:37] and they had a good old time. As soon as
[46:39] he came down from that mountain, what
[46:41] was waiting on him? A devil. Confusion.
[46:44] Devil don't take No, he don't care
[46:45] because you had a good time in church.
[46:47] He don't care because you was slain in
[46:49] the spirit. He's going to be waiting for
[46:51] you. Why? Because he's your adversary.
[46:55] His purpose is to to to mess our lives
[46:57] up. But God has given us the victory.
[47:00] Amen. So 2 Corinthians chap 10 4:4-5.
[47:04] Here's Paul saying, "For the weapons of
[47:06] our warfare are not carnal." Amen. But
[47:09] they are mighty through God to the
[47:11] pulling down of strongholds. Paul is
[47:13] telling us here that people are not your
[47:14] problem. Your job is not your problem.
[47:16] That boss on the whatever that people
[47:19] circumstances are not your problem. He's
[47:21] telling us that for the weapons of our
[47:22] warfare are not carnal. We can't attack
[47:24] the enemy from a carnal perspective.
[47:26] Then he tells us how we overcome. Amen.
[47:29] Verse 5, he says, "Casting down
[47:32] imaginations,
[47:33] and every high thing that exalted itself
[47:37] against the knowledge of God, and
[47:40] bringing into activity, every somebody
[47:42] say every every thought, not just the
[47:45] bad thoughts, even your good thoughts
[47:48] that you may think sound good, may may
[47:51] feel good, but he's telling every
[47:53] thought, whether good or bad, you take
[47:55] it to the captivity
[47:57] through the obedience of Christ. So I
[48:00] want to take from a a a thought here
[48:01] from that pastor scripture. Mind
[48:03] control. Amen. Mind control. May the
[48:06] Lord add blessing to the reading of his
[48:07] word. You may be seated.
[48:09] Thank you.
[48:12] Father God, you preached a message uh
[48:14] the greatest battle ever fought. I know
[48:16] many it's a a message that is very
[48:18] familiar. A lot of us has probably read
[48:20] it or listened to it. But it it it is a
[48:23] place to where he lays out to where the
[48:24] first battle that was ever fought began
[48:26] in the heaven. And then he says Satan
[48:28] was cast down from the heavens into the
[48:30] earth. And then he outlines where the
[48:32] battle is today. And he says that battle
[48:34] is where? In our minds.
[48:37] Um he says here when when this great
[48:39] battle started on earth, he says the
[48:41] battlegrounds begin in the human mind.
[48:43] Decisions are made from the mind ahead.
[48:45] The battlegrounds where you've got he
[48:48] didn't say maybe. He says the
[48:49] battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[48:52] the enemy is in your mind.
[48:56] Come on. But he wants us to think it's
[48:58] uh brother Matias he talked about me so
[49:00] I got to give him a piece of my mind.
[49:02] Matias ain't your problem. You got to
[49:05] make sure your motives and your
[49:07] objectives are right because the enemy
[49:08] is very crafty. He came to Eve not with
[49:11] some oh you go rob a bank. He's not
[49:13] going to come to us with these obvious
[49:15] stuff. He's going to try to twist the
[49:17] word up to make you think you're right.
[49:20] Amen. Right. Here's the definition of
[49:22] the mind here. The mind is the human
[49:24] element part substance or process that
[49:26] reasons, thinks, feels, wills,
[49:30] perceives, decides, and judges. Most
[49:33] people have a mindset. You can be
[49:37] absent-minded.
[49:39] You can be open-minded.
[49:42] You can be narrowminded or close-minded.
[49:45] And you can be out of your mind. And you
[49:48] can be in your right mind. Amen. Amen.
[49:52] Uh Aristotle uh I found this quote um
[49:55] everybody know who Aristotle is right he
[49:57] I found this quote that he he said he
[49:59] says happiness is a state of mind he
[50:02] says we are shaped by our thoughts we
[50:06] become what we think
[50:09] he says if you don't mind it doesn't
[50:12] matter now I want y'all to catch this is
[50:14] Aristotle he says it is the mark of an
[50:17] educated mind to be able to entertain a
[50:21] thought without accepting it. Amen.
[50:25] Amen.
[50:27] It is the mark of an educated mature
[50:30] mind. He's this Aristotle. He ain't
[50:31] believe. I don't believe. But he says it
[50:33] is a mark of an educated mind to be able
[50:36] to entertain a thought without accepting
[50:39] it. Amen. Prophet God says it. But when
[50:41] it comes to reality, your mind opens up.
[50:44] Your mind either accepts it or rejects
[50:46] it. It is your mind that opens up the
[50:50] door or closes the door.
[50:55] Thank you, let's go to 2 Corinthians
[50:57] chap verse 11. Why is the mind so
[50:59] important? Why is it the devil's
[51:02] playground, if you will?
[51:09] Paul says here 11:3 but I fear lest by
[51:12] any means as the serpent begaled Eve
[51:15] through her through his subtlety so your
[51:17] mind should be corrupted for simplicity
[51:20] that is in Christ. I want Paul talks
[51:22] about the mind more than anybody else in
[51:25] the Bible. Anybody else in the Bible,
[51:28] Paul hits it hard. Why? Because he
[51:30] understood that real transformation
[51:33] don't begin with your feet. Don't begin
[51:35] with your actions. It starts in your
[51:37] mind. Yes. Yes. He understood this is
[51:40] where transformation starts. He was
[51:42] deeply aware of strongholds. He talks
[51:44] about uh uh uh the Gentiles being
[51:46] surrounded by pain. He understood that
[51:48] the concept of how to overcome in this
[51:50] day and age, it starts in your mind. He
[51:53] himself battled with the internal
[51:55] thoughts and contradictions. Romans 7:23
[51:57] says he was waring against the own law
[51:59] in his mind.
[52:04] You know, a few weeks ago, maybe it was
[52:07] last week, Trump fired some rockets uh
[52:12] to Iran. And that night a few brothers
[52:15] called me
[52:18] and believers and they were calling me
[52:20] manas tell me what do you think man
[52:22] what's going on you think the world
[52:24] about to come to an end you think we
[52:25] need to what what we need to do this
[52:26] we're panicking and I said what y'all
[52:28] worrying about
[52:30] this stuff's supposed to happen we
[52:33] should be rejoicing because the time is
[52:35] at hand if your life ain't right
[52:39] if you know you got things you need to
[52:41] clean up then you should be fearful but
[52:42] if you know you've serving God and you
[52:44] see these things being manifested, Trump
[52:46] can do whatever he want. I got nothing
[52:48] to worry about. Before one rocket hits
[52:51] the United States, church, we out of
[52:53] here. Amen. Bless. I say this stuff
[52:56] shouldn't drive you out of fear. It
[52:58] should drive you to your knees.
[53:00] Praying for your family members, praying
[53:02] for yourself.
[53:04] [Applause]
[53:07] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[53:09] Don't worry about what's going on down
[53:11] here in this world. drunk can do
[53:12] whatever he got to do. He holds my life
[53:15] in his hand.
[53:18] Go ahead. Amen. Amen. Sister, if you can
[53:20] if you could pull that slide up, Sister
[53:21] Abigail, it says, "Why does the devil
[53:22] choose the mind as his starting point?"
[53:25] I use this slide. I taught a series on
[53:28] uh character development.
[53:30] And it it is a very powerful slide
[53:33] because it it it shows outlines we
[53:35] understand that character is not a gift,
[53:36] it's a victory. But if you understand
[53:39] why the devil uses our mind to to to
[53:42] impact us. It's because our mind
[53:43] controls every aspect of it. Amen. I
[53:48] She says not working. Let's give our
[53:49] sister Abigail Hancock a praise. She's
[53:51] having some technical difficulties.
[53:53] Amen. But until she finds it, I want to
[53:55] I want to read something here. The Bible
[53:56] says the prophet God said in that same
[53:58] message, the greatest battle of all. He
[53:59] said, "Decisions are made in the mind."
[54:01] That's your head. And here's why. Here's
[54:04] here's a fact here I want to read to
[54:06] you. The human mind has about 6 to 8,000
[54:09] thoughts per day.
[54:12] That's a lot of thoughts. Some of you
[54:14] probably thinking right now, right? So 6
[54:17] to 8,000 thoughts per day. According to
[54:20] research, up to 80% of our thoughts are
[54:25] negative.
[54:27] 80%
[54:29] of that 6 to 8,000 thoughts are
[54:32] negative.
[54:34] And as you can see from this slide here,
[54:36] this is why Satan because your thoughts
[54:39] dictate your words because before we do
[54:41] anything, before we say anything, it
[54:43] starts with a thought. That's right.
[54:44] That's right. It starts in your brain.
[54:46] It starts up here. Before you say
[54:48] something, you thought it first. Before
[54:50] you do something, you thought it first.
[54:52] Amen. So your thoughts drive your words.
[54:54] Your words drive your actions. Your
[54:56] actions create habits. Your habits drive
[54:58] your attitude. Now it it develops your
[55:00] charact when people say that's just the
[55:01] way that I am. Yeah, that may be true,
[55:03] but that's not where the way God want
[55:04] you to be. He said from whom he forneew
[55:07] he predestinated to be conformed.
[55:12] So you can't just use that. That's just
[55:14] the way that I am. If I keep upsetting
[55:17] you, you just got to take it the way it
[55:18] is. That ain't why God went to Calvary
[55:20] and died. Amen. Amen. That's right. We
[55:23] can't fix this flesh. But God gave us
[55:24] the power to overcome.
[55:27] Amen. Amen. So when the people say that,
[55:30] I say, don't accept that. Amen. That
[55:33] starts with that's your reasoning.
[55:35] That's your justification. That's you
[55:37] trying to justify what God is saying. I
[55:39] come to fix that. Amen. Amen.
[55:42] Hallelujah.
[55:44] Just accept it and say, "Lord, fix me.
[55:46] I'm the potter. You are the what?" Clay.
[55:49] Amen. Just say, "Lord, mold me." Amen.
[55:53] Amen. Yes. Hallelujah. So, it starts
[55:56] with our thoughts. Your character is a
[55:59] victory. So, guess what? You got to
[56:00] overcome. You've got to overcome your
[56:02] thoughts. You've got to change your
[56:03] words, change your actions, change your
[56:05] habits. Amen. It's a fight. And it
[56:08] starts in your mind.
[56:11] Come on.
[56:13] A 2005 study, sister, if you can leave
[56:15] that up there, by the National Science
[56:17] Foundation found that thousands of
[56:19] thoughts that people have daily,
[56:22] approximately
[56:23] 80% are negative. And I want y'all to
[56:27] catch this. 95% are repetitive
[56:32] from day to day.
[56:35] I'm going tell you, the enemy don't take
[56:36] no time off. Same thought you had
[56:39] yesterday, you going to wake up, same
[56:41] thought again. But so you got to be
[56:42] ready. Be sober. Be vigilant because
[56:46] your adversary. That's right. The devil
[56:48] is looking for a small crack to slip in
[56:53] for you to reason and accept that
[56:55] thought. We just read once you accept
[56:57] that thought, you've allowed Satan to
[56:59] start building a stronghold in your
[57:01] mind. Amen. That's right. The average
[57:05] person has about 6,000 8 4,000 thoughts
[57:08] of Neville. Then the battlefield of our
[57:09] mind is not a maybe. Church, it is a
[57:12] guarantee. Amen. This is where it
[57:15] starts. Starts in your thoughts. Your
[57:18] thoughts will drive your words. This is
[57:19] character development. This is how you
[57:21] do it. God is coming back for it. Not
[57:23] your body. He coming back for your
[57:25] character.
[57:27] So if your mindset is God made me this
[57:29] way, you was born in sin, shaped in
[57:32] iniquity. That's right. He came and died
[57:34] to fix you.
[57:38] That's right, church. We're not perfect.
[57:41] Amen. Filled with the Holy Ghost. We
[57:43] still got flaws. Yes. Yes. We still have
[57:46] errors of our ways. But the Holy Ghost
[57:48] on the inside of you in action causes
[57:51] you to want to fix that.
[57:54] Amen. Here's Peter on the day of
[57:56] Pentecost, part of the 120, filled with
[57:58] the spirit. Amen. But when pressure
[58:00] came, those thoughts came in his mind.
[58:03] Guess what? He was a little he was a
[58:04] little prejudice. Since I'm around my
[58:06] Jewish buddies, I'm I'm I'mma I'm I'm
[58:09] not not associate myself with the
[58:11] Gentiles.
[58:13] Filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen.
[58:15] So, here's another Holy Ghost believer.
[58:17] Paul comes up to him, confronts him to
[58:18] his face. Now, I want y'all to think
[58:20] about Peter in this moment. In this
[58:22] moment around all these people that that
[58:25] esteem him to highlight, think about the
[58:28] mind battle he's having at this very
[58:30] moment. Paul confronted him to his face
[58:32] around all these people. Amen. You going
[58:36] to let Paul talk to you like that?
[58:39] Who does Paul think he is? You're the
[58:40] elder here. Paul should have pulled you
[58:43] to the side. But something on the inside
[58:45] of Peter realize that's the Holy Ghost
[58:49] responding in action. You know what? I'm
[58:51] wrong. That's right. Lord, help me.
[58:53] That's what the Holy Ghost does.
[58:57] Comes to to give us the power, church,
[58:59] to fix ourselves cuz we can't do it. He
[59:02] does. Amen. Let's give a little hand
[59:03] clap of praise. Amen. All right.
[59:07] So, the devil chooses the mind as a
[59:09] starting point because it is the control
[59:11] center of a person's life as we see here
[59:13] spiritually, emotionally, and
[59:15] behaviorally. It influences our thoughts
[59:18] and he can if he can influence our
[59:19] thoughts, he can influence our life.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:24] So, I want to I want to break down three
[59:26] aspects here
[59:28] and how we win this battle of our
[59:31] thoughts. And there's three pieces I
[59:32] want to talk about. Renew, capture, and
[59:35] guard. Amen. Let's turn to Ephesians
[59:37] chapter 4:23.
[59:39] Everybody good? Amen.
[59:44] So, you can't fight uh effectively on a
[59:48] battleground you're not prepared for.
[59:50] Amen. You go through history, look at
[59:52] all the wars, civil wars, the battle of
[59:54] Gettsburg, battle here, the these people
[59:56] sent scouts out. Okay, if this is where
[59:58] the battle is going to be, let's figure
[1:00:00] out how we can get the upper hand.
[1:00:01] Where's the high ground? Where's the low
[1:00:03] ground? So, we got to understand if this
[1:00:05] is Satan's battleground, as the prophet
[1:00:07] of God puts it, we got to know how to
[1:00:08] fight him in that area. The Bible says
[1:00:11] here in Ephesians 4:20 to see, and be
[1:00:13] renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[1:00:17] What does that word be renewed mean? It
[1:00:19] means a continual and ongoing process.
[1:00:23] This is not like a you go renew your
[1:00:25] license once every what 10 years. This
[1:00:27] ain't what that scripture talk about.
[1:00:29] That's the wrong type of renewal. This
[1:00:30] is something that is continually and
[1:00:32] ongoing. That's right. It's about a
[1:00:34] total renovation. And he says it's in
[1:00:37] the spirit. It's your inner attitude. So
[1:00:40] Ephesians 4:2 says, "Let God continually
[1:00:42] renovate the deepest part of our thought
[1:00:44] life." Romans 12:2 says, "And be not
[1:00:47] conformed to this world, but be ye
[1:00:48] transformed by the what? Renewing of
[1:00:52] your mind." It's like sleep.
[1:00:54] We all need sleep every night. Some of
[1:00:56] you probably thinking about it right
[1:00:57] now. I need sleep. I'm tired. I had a
[1:00:59] long week. That's your body telling you
[1:01:02] you need to renew. Amen. The process of
[1:01:04] renewal when you sleep, what does it do?
[1:01:06] It it it resets your nervous system. It
[1:01:08] cleans your brain. It processes memory
[1:01:11] and emotion. And it prepares you for a
[1:01:13] new day.
[1:01:15] You ever didn't have enough sleep? Your
[1:01:17] your next day probably not going to be
[1:01:18] very well. You're going to be
[1:01:20] short-tempered. You probably going to be
[1:01:21] highly aggravated because your body is
[1:01:23] telling you you need sleep. Amen. And
[1:01:26] it's the same way in the spirit. We have
[1:01:28] to renew our mind daily. The prophet uh
[1:01:31] uh uh uh the Lord's prayer says it's a
[1:01:33] daily bread. Give us this day our what?
[1:01:35] Daily bread. I need you every day. Amen.
[1:01:39] So to renew spiritually is mean to be
[1:01:41] made new again in nature. Strength and
[1:01:44] purpose especially in alignment with
[1:01:47] God's will. It involves restoration. It
[1:01:50] involves transformation. And it involves
[1:01:53] a daily cleansing. Yes. Yes. The Greek
[1:01:56] word for renewed is ano. It implies a
[1:02:00] continuous. I want y'all to catch this.
[1:02:02] And progressive
[1:02:04] change, not a one-time event. Amen.
[1:02:07] Amen. Oh, I came to the altar. I got
[1:02:10] prayed for. I'm renewed. It don't stop
[1:02:11] there. Amen.
[1:02:15] Why is having a renewed mind so
[1:02:17] important, brother Matias? Our renewal
[1:02:19] has to be constant because the I said it
[1:02:21] in the beginning. The devil don't take
[1:02:23] no time off. Amen.
[1:02:26] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Be sober. Be
[1:02:30] vigilant. He's giving you He's giving
[1:02:31] you instructions of how to combat. Be
[1:02:34] sober. Be vigilant. Because your
[1:02:37] adversary, the devil, is right now
[1:02:40] walking around thinking of ways. Brother
[1:02:42] Matias been reading his Bible. Oh, I can
[1:02:44] get him now. Let me have somebody cut
[1:02:46] him off on the street today and see how
[1:02:49] he respond.
[1:02:50] Blessing Jesus.
[1:02:54] The devil knows. He knows where when we
[1:02:56] at our weakest. He He'll get you at a
[1:02:57] point you didn't have your coffee that
[1:02:59] morning. You didn't have sleep last
[1:03:00] night. That be that one day he anoint
[1:03:02] your boss to just drive you crazy.
[1:03:05] That be the day your boss get on your
[1:03:07] nerves. That be the day everybody want
[1:03:08] to cut you off. That be the day
[1:03:09] everybody driving slow. I got to get to
[1:03:11] work. And you find yourself getting out
[1:03:14] of character. Amen. Amen. But when you
[1:03:17] start your morning with a prayer, Amen.
[1:03:19] When you start your morning with a
[1:03:20] devotional, it prepares you and it
[1:03:23] resets your mind. Amen. Says, "Lord, get
[1:03:26] me ready for this day cuz I know the
[1:03:27] devil's waiting to trip me up." Amen.
[1:03:30] Amen. Renewing your mind in the spirit
[1:03:34] of your mind. Amen. Because this nature
[1:03:37] is corrupt. Amen. Paul said, "In this
[1:03:39] flesh dwelleth no good thing." You can't
[1:03:42] fix this flesh. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:03:46] Cuz how much you come to church, you
[1:03:48] can't fix it. You were born in sin,
[1:03:49] shaped in iniquity. That's right. Amen.
[1:03:52] You need the Holy Ghost. Gmen.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. The flesh
[1:03:57] still wants to do what it wants to do.
[1:04:00] And here's here's the warning. If you
[1:04:02] don't renew, you will revert.
[1:04:05] Yes. Yes. Come on. I'll say that again.
[1:04:09] If you don't constantly renew this mind,
[1:04:12] you will find yourself doing the things
[1:04:14] you used to do. Bless. Bless. You know,
[1:04:18] I I shocked my parents one time when I
[1:04:19] was preaching and I told them that when
[1:04:22] I was in high school.
[1:04:24] I I used to cuss real bad.
[1:04:27] My mom sitting over there. I never
[1:04:28] forget. She's like shocked cuz I didn't
[1:04:30] cuss naturally. I wouldn't cuss when I'm
[1:04:31] at the home or at the church. But when I
[1:04:34] was in that school, I tell you what, but
[1:04:36] God delivered me from that. Right? So,
[1:04:38] so the power of the Holy Ghost, he
[1:04:40] delivered. So, I don't cuss. Don't even
[1:04:41] think to cuss. But here's what I won't
[1:04:42] do. I won't go hang around people who
[1:04:44] cuss. I won't go watch movies with
[1:04:46] because I know that thing that's on the
[1:04:48] inside is waiting for the opportunity to
[1:04:51] rise back up again. Why did Paul say, "I
[1:04:54] have to die." What? Daily.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] Yeah. Yeah, I'm crucified with Christ,
[1:05:00] but that don't mean that flesh trying to
[1:05:02] wiggle off that cross waiting for an
[1:05:04] opportunity. Let me get let me squeeze
[1:05:05] off this cross a little bit. We have to
[1:05:07] die daily, church.
[1:05:10] Amen. Amen. You can't you by yourself
[1:05:12] can't overcome. That's why the Bible
[1:05:14] gives us scripture. Forsake the very
[1:05:16] presence of evil. Keep the company you
[1:05:18] keep. They they can distract you. They
[1:05:20] can they can influence you. Amen. You
[1:05:23] can't. There's a brother that I've been
[1:05:24] witnessing to and and he's um he always
[1:05:27] tells me, "Man, I want to get my life
[1:05:29] right." And I know he's not ready. And
[1:05:31] he said, he told me one day, he said,
[1:05:32] "Man, I'm going to go up and I'm going
[1:05:33] to get baptized Sunday." And I said,
[1:05:36] "Man, let me I want you to be honest
[1:05:37] with me." I said, "Because baptizing is
[1:05:40] not something you check a box for."
[1:05:42] Amen. You want to get baptized and you
[1:05:44] want to give your life to Christ, you
[1:05:46] got to repent. And that word repent,
[1:05:48] that's not saying, "I'm sorry, Lord,"
[1:05:49] because you feel bad. That means you
[1:05:52] made a decision to turn away. And I
[1:05:55] said, if you have not made in your heart
[1:05:56] right now the decision to forsake all
[1:05:59] your friends, all this other stuff, then
[1:06:02] don't waste your time.
[1:06:05] Cuz in your heart, you still want to do
[1:06:08] what you want to do. Amen.
[1:06:13] I I'm I'm all about church. I'm I'm not
[1:06:15] I'm not waste I don't want to waste
[1:06:17] people's time. You got to make people
[1:06:18] sure people's hearts are right. Amen.
[1:06:20] Cuz it starts with the heart. When God
[1:06:22] convicts the heart, he breaks the heart.
[1:06:24] The heart pulls you up. Not off no
[1:06:25] emotions. Not off I feel bad for what I
[1:06:28] did. Yes, that's a part of it. But God
[1:06:30] God draweth. There has to be something
[1:06:32] pulling you. Not getting baptized
[1:06:34] because mama don't want me to get
[1:06:35] baptized. Or daddy, there's something
[1:06:37] tugging on the inside. And you have to
[1:06:39] make a decision to forsake all.
[1:06:42] Amen.
[1:06:44] Amen. Go ahead.
[1:06:47] You You got to be willing to give up
[1:06:49] something. Amen. Cuz it ain't going to
[1:06:51] be convenient. Amen. Go ahead, Jesus.
[1:06:55] Amen. I don't know why I went there. All
[1:06:57] right, let's go to chap Romans chapter 7
[1:06:59] 21.
[1:07:06] This is Paul here. What I said before,
[1:07:08] Paul talks about the mind so much during
[1:07:10] his ministry. He says here in Romans 7
[1:07:12] chapter 21, this is Paul the first
[1:07:14] messenger to the to the first church
[1:07:15] age, right? He says verse 21 says, "I
[1:07:18] find then a law that when I would do
[1:07:20] good, what evil is present with me." Why
[1:07:24] I'm doing good?
[1:07:27] For I delight in the law of God after
[1:07:29] the inward man. But I see another law in
[1:07:32] my members, waring against the law of
[1:07:35] the mind of my mind, and bringing me
[1:07:38] into captivity to the law of sin which
[1:07:42] is in my mirrors. Even though Paul wants
[1:07:44] to do right, M even though his mind
[1:07:48] delights in God's word, there's still an
[1:07:51] old pattern, an old law of sin still
[1:07:56] trying to rise back up.
[1:08:00] And where does that war take place,
[1:08:01] church? In his mind, because
[1:08:04] unfortunately, church, we have a memory.
[1:08:08] And the devil will always try to bring
[1:08:11] back into remembrance the things you
[1:08:13] used to do. Bless the things you used to
[1:08:16] say, that music you used to get with in
[1:08:18] the club, he'll try to remind you over
[1:08:21] there. But it starts with the thought
[1:08:23] that don't make it a sin. When that
[1:08:26] thought comes in there, you have the
[1:08:27] power to either accept that thought.
[1:08:30] That's right. Or take it into captivity.
[1:08:32] That's right.
[1:08:35] Paul here, he he wasn't a sinner, but he
[1:08:38] was a sanctified man with a memory. He
[1:08:41] was filled with the Holy Ghost. But that
[1:08:43] old man kept trying to rise back up.
[1:08:48] Romans 7:15 says, "For that which I do,
[1:08:51] I allow not. For what I would, that I do
[1:08:54] not. But what I hate," he says, "that I
[1:08:58] do." Paul is here admitting that the
[1:09:00] things I still hate, he's trying to rise
[1:09:02] back up. I hate it. But why won't it go
[1:09:04] away?
[1:09:07] Because the old nature does not die
[1:09:10] easily. And the first place it'll try to
[1:09:12] resurrect itself is where?
[1:09:14] In your mind.
[1:09:18] Our minds have to be renewed just like
[1:09:20] you changing oil in your car. You drive
[1:09:23] around for 5 years with that same oil in
[1:09:25] your car if you want to. You'll be on
[1:09:27] the side of the road. It's not a one
[1:09:29] time event. It's something you have to
[1:09:31] constantly get changed. Why? Because the
[1:09:33] the the oil collects dirt. It collects
[1:09:35] all of these things. And you got to
[1:09:37] change it out. Amen. It's the same day.
[1:09:39] It's not something you do once a month.
[1:09:40] Renewing your mind. It's not something
[1:09:42] you do on a Sunday, but it's something
[1:09:44] we have to do every day. Second
[1:09:46] Corinthians 4:16 says, "Throw our
[1:09:49] outward man perish. Yet the inward man
[1:09:52] is renewed day by day.
[1:09:58] Brother, how do I renew my mind?" I
[1:10:01] found this quote here in the greatest
[1:10:03] battle. Very powerful message. And I
[1:10:05] hate to to to keep going back to that,
[1:10:07] but it is a message that answers every
[1:10:08] question when it comes down to
[1:10:09] overcoming the enemy in your mind. He
[1:10:11] says, "Now, if you sit down when you get
[1:10:13] home and draw three little rings," he
[1:10:15] says, "You'll find out that the outside
[1:10:18] body has five senses is contacted by,
[1:10:20] and that is see, taste, feel, smell, and
[1:10:22] hear." That's the five senses that
[1:10:24] control the human body. He says, um,
[1:10:27] inside of the body is a soul. When the
[1:10:29] soul is controlled by imaginations, your
[1:10:32] conscience, your memory, your reasons,
[1:10:33] and your affections,
[1:10:35] that's the thing that controls the soul.
[1:10:37] He says, "But the spirit, it only has
[1:10:39] one sense."
[1:10:42] The spirit, oh, let's get it. The spirit
[1:10:44] has uh uh one sense, and that sense is
[1:10:48] either dominates it is faith or doubt.
[1:10:53] He says that's exactly and there's one,
[1:10:55] he says there's one avenue to it. Y'all
[1:10:57] catch this. He says that's free moral
[1:11:00] agency.
[1:11:02] You can accept doubt or you can accept
[1:11:06] faith. Amen. Either one you want to work
[1:11:09] on. Therefore, Satan begin at the
[1:11:11] principal part to cause the spirit of
[1:11:13] man to doubt God's word. Amen. So, how
[1:11:17] do you renew your mind?
[1:11:21] Amen. Through the word of God. True.
[1:11:23] Amen. Lord, sanctify them through thy
[1:11:26] truth. Thy word is what? Truth. It's
[1:11:29] truth. God's word washes the mind from
[1:11:31] lies, from fear, from doubt. Amen. They
[1:11:36] say your family ain't going to make it.
[1:11:38] God washes that away. I'mma always be
[1:11:41] broke. God washes that away.
[1:11:45] Amen. You got to renew your mind,
[1:11:48] church.
[1:11:51] Doctor says the doctor report says this,
[1:11:54] by his stripes. Yes sir. Hallelujah.
[1:11:57] Daily you got to remind yourself
[1:12:00] encourage yourself in the Lord.
[1:12:05] Seem like things are getting worse
[1:12:07] instead of getting better. David found
[1:12:09] himself in that place. He says many are
[1:12:11] they that rise up against me. Those are
[1:12:14] thoughts in his mind. But he finds
[1:12:16] himself and says thou, oh Lord, are my
[1:12:18] shield.
[1:12:21] Hallelujah. Yeah. Those m those thoughts
[1:12:24] happen.
[1:12:25] David is in distress. He's running for
[1:12:27] his life. Amen. But he finds himself
[1:12:30] having a a a mind battle. And he has the
[1:12:34] power to say, "But thou, oh Lord, Amen.
[1:12:37] are shield for me." Amen. You're my
[1:12:40] glory. And you lift my head up when I'm
[1:12:42] down. When I don't understand it,
[1:12:45] hallelujah. You're still there. Glory.
[1:12:49] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:12:52] Thank you, Jesus. But his delight is in
[1:12:55] the law of the Lord. And in his law
[1:12:59] he meditate day and night. Amen. Day and
[1:13:05] night. What's the purpose of you getting
[1:13:07] into this word? It's not to check a box
[1:13:09] and said, "I did my devotional today."
[1:13:11] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:13:13] My phone popped up said, "Hey, listen to
[1:13:15] your devotional." That ain't the
[1:13:17] purpose, church. That becomes a routine
[1:13:20] and you missed. That's what the John
[1:13:22] writes the letter to to the Ephesian
[1:13:23] church age in Revelation 3. He says,
[1:13:25] "You're doing all of these things you're
[1:13:27] coming to church to." He says, "But you
[1:13:28] left your first love." He didn't say
[1:13:31] they didn't love him. They just didn't
[1:13:32] love him first. Your driving factor to
[1:13:35] getting into this book should be your
[1:13:38] love and relationship for him.
[1:13:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[1:13:44] Jesus. If you want to transform life,
[1:13:46] you have to have a renewed mind. Amen.
[1:13:50] Let's go to Isaiah chapter 26 and 3.
[1:13:55] World right now is looking for peace.
[1:13:57] Things are going crazy politically.
[1:13:59] Things are going crazy financially.
[1:14:00] Things are going crazy all over the
[1:14:01] world. So people are looking for peace.
[1:14:04] But the peace God gives ain't an outward
[1:14:06] peace. It doesn't start from anything
[1:14:08] out there. Starts on the inside. And how
[1:14:11] does the Bible says we get this perfect
[1:14:14] peace? Thou will keep him in perfect
[1:14:17] peace whose mind is. You got to stay
[1:14:20] there. Amen. Amen. Not a place you can
[1:14:24] visit periodically. Amen. This ain't no
[1:14:27] work visa. This ain't a place you can
[1:14:29] come and say, "I'm only here for a
[1:14:31] period of time." He said you have to
[1:14:33] stay there. Not a place you visit on
[1:14:35] vacation. It's your legal residence.
[1:14:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. Who's that? David
[1:14:41] said, "I would uh uh get surely goodness
[1:14:43] and mercy. Follow me all the days of my
[1:14:45] life. And I will dwell in the house of
[1:14:48] the Lord. Not just on Sundays, not just
[1:14:50] on Wednesday nights, not just on
[1:14:52] Fridays, but every day. Amen. Cuz he
[1:14:56] follows me. Amen. Amen. I think it was
[1:14:58] in Moses in Exodus chapter 33. God tells
[1:15:01] him, "I'm going to send an angel before
[1:15:03] you." Uh, and Moses tells God, he says,
[1:15:05] "Man, if you don't go with me to face
[1:15:07] these people, I ain't moving. I'm going
[1:15:09] to stay right here." That's right.
[1:15:11] Because I need your presence every day.
[1:15:13] Not just on Sunday morning. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:18] Amen. Not not just a place that we visit
[1:15:21] church. All right. So, let's go to uh 2
[1:15:23] Corinthians chap 10:5. Let's give the
[1:15:25] Lord a hand clap a praise. Amen. I'm
[1:15:26] almost done. I want to keep you long.
[1:15:30] All right. So, this is a big one. So,
[1:15:31] after you've renewed your mind, you've
[1:15:33] done your pre-work, you've done your
[1:15:35] workout, you've done you've gotten ready
[1:15:37] for the big game, you're prepared,
[1:15:39] you've watched the film, you're
[1:15:40] prepared, you've you prophet God said in
[1:15:42] the message this year in the church age,
[1:15:43] he said, "No believer is either
[1:15:44] spiritually strong or alive than his
[1:15:46] knowledge of the word of God and his
[1:15:48] adherence to it." Like what we have a
[1:15:52] lot today is a lot of knowledge. Amen.
[1:15:55] But no adherence. Amen.
[1:15:58] All right. So it says here, for the
[1:15:59] weapons of our warfare are not what
[1:16:01] carnal, but they are mighty through God
[1:16:04] to the pulling down of strongholds. Here
[1:16:07] we go. Casting down imaginations and
[1:16:10] every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:16:12] against the knowledge of God and
[1:16:14] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:16:18] the obedience of Christ. That word
[1:16:20] capture means to seize, control, and
[1:16:23] command your thoughts before they
[1:16:25] control you. Amen.
[1:16:27] Uh it it's not something that is gentle.
[1:16:30] It is a violent spiritual warfare
[1:16:32] language. Paul here is painting a
[1:16:35] picture of you arresting your thoughts,
[1:16:37] handcuffing them. This is not like you
[1:16:39] get stopped on the side of the road for
[1:16:41] speeding and the policeman gives you a
[1:16:42] warning. You don't give the devil a
[1:16:44] warning. You going to jail. That thought
[1:16:47] you just gave me. Don't you ever
[1:16:50] give me this thought again. You got to
[1:16:51] take it. You got to capture it. You
[1:16:53] don't play around with it.
[1:16:56] Amen. And he says all your thoughts
[1:16:58] because every thought, not just the
[1:17:01] sinful thoughts, because of course,
[1:17:02] brother Matias, you got fired on your
[1:17:03] job. Devil ain't going to come and say,
[1:17:04] "Go rob that bank." Cuz I know that's
[1:17:05] why would I do that? That's crazy.
[1:17:08] What he'll do? He'll play mind battles.
[1:17:11] Okay. There's a job opening. Brother
[1:17:12] Matias. Yeah. To keep you out of church
[1:17:14] three or four Sundays, but as long as
[1:17:16] you pay your tithe, the Bible says if
[1:17:18] you pay your tithe, put it in the
[1:17:19] storehouse, he'll bless you.
[1:17:22] What that brings? Reasoning. Yeah.
[1:17:27] But if I take it captive and says, "Seek
[1:17:30] ye first the kingdom of God." Devil, you
[1:17:33] a liar. I will not take that job because
[1:17:35] my job, my God is Jehovah, Gyra.
[1:17:40] Isaac tells Abraham, "Daddy, where's the
[1:17:42] sacrifice?" We we going to Abraham
[1:17:45] didn't reason. He had no answers. But
[1:17:47] what did he say? God will provide. Don't
[1:17:49] know how. Don't know where, but I know
[1:17:52] he's going to provide. That's a thought
[1:17:53] he took captive. He had the opportunity
[1:17:56] to reason. Amen.
[1:18:01] Says every thought, not just sinful
[1:18:04] thoughts, not just lustful, not just
[1:18:06] fearful, anxious, prideful, but also
[1:18:08] your self-righteous thoughts, your
[1:18:11] assumptions, your justifications.
[1:18:14] Even though your ideal may be a good
[1:18:16] idea, it may not be a God idea. Because
[1:18:19] what's driving your thought? Amen.
[1:18:21] Jesus. Just because it's a good thought,
[1:18:24] did it come from God? Amen.
[1:18:30] Some of our good thoughts can be rooted
[1:18:32] in pride. Amen. Selfishness,
[1:18:36] ambition, Amen. The lust of the flesh,
[1:18:40] the lust of the eye, and the pride of
[1:18:42] life. Amen. They can be good thoughts,
[1:18:45] good ideas, good things, but if it
[1:18:48] contradicts this word, That's right. You
[1:18:51] have to take it captive.
[1:18:54] Amen. Why? Because James tells us that
[1:18:57] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:18:59] away from what? His own lust. Amen.
[1:19:04] No exceptions. Every man, he says it
[1:19:07] must be accepted in the mind and is
[1:19:09] believed with the heart. Then the word
[1:19:10] of God becomes a reality. Then every
[1:19:13] senses of our soul and body is scored
[1:19:15] out with the Holy Spirit. Then your
[1:19:17] sense of God, your conscience of God,
[1:19:20] everything that's godly flows through
[1:19:22] you. 1 Peter 1 and13 says, "Wherefore
[1:19:26] gord up the loins of your mind." Here's
[1:19:28] that word again. Be sober and hope to
[1:19:31] the end for the grace that is brought
[1:19:33] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ. Jesus uh why is Peter saying
[1:19:38] gird up the loins of your mind? Because
[1:19:39] he knew trouble was coming. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:42] And holiness and all those things that
[1:19:44] starts in the mindset, right? It starts
[1:19:45] here. Um, gird up the loins of your
[1:19:48] mind. Paul pulls in an example here of
[1:19:50] how back in those days when when they
[1:19:53] would go running around, they would have
[1:19:54] to pull up their loins of their their uh
[1:19:58] clothes so they wouldn't trip. So, he's
[1:20:00] saying you have to be prepared here.
[1:20:02] Just like a soldier wouldn't run into
[1:20:03] battle with his rope dragging behind
[1:20:05] him, Peter is saying a believer can't
[1:20:07] run this race with loose thoughts just
[1:20:10] hanging around everywhere. True. Amen.
[1:20:12] Fear, distraction. The Bible says, "A
[1:20:15] double-minded man is what?" unstable.
[1:20:18] Not in some, but in all of his ways.
[1:20:24] But here's the I want I want to share
[1:20:26] this scientific uh fact because the the
[1:20:29] devil's
[1:20:31] how should I put this moments where he
[1:20:33] would try to attack you is when you're
[1:20:35] at your weakest. He came to Jesus in the
[1:20:38] wilderness when Jesus was at his weakest
[1:20:42] fleshwise.
[1:20:45] And the the things that he came to Jesus
[1:20:49] at church were legitimate needs. Was
[1:20:52] Jesus hungry? Yes.
[1:20:54] But what did he do? He took that
[1:20:56] thought, that emotion, and he took it
[1:20:59] captive to what? The obedience of
[1:21:00] Christ. Man shall not live by bread
[1:21:02] alone. Here's a scientific fact here
[1:21:04] about your brain, your mind. I want y to
[1:21:06] I want y'all to really catch this. This
[1:21:07] is why we have to be ready and prepared.
[1:21:10] He says it says every time a problem
[1:21:12] arises
[1:21:14] your brain
[1:21:16] anytime a problem arises your brain is
[1:21:19] designed to automatically go into
[1:21:22] problemsolving mode.
[1:21:25] You get a text right now from somebody
[1:21:26] and say the roast is burn at home.
[1:21:29] Immediately your brain is trying to
[1:21:31] figure out what I need to do by dinner.
[1:21:33] Do I need to go to Publix? Do I need to
[1:21:34] go to KFC? Do you get fired on your job?
[1:21:36] The immediately your brain starts to
[1:21:38] work in what you going to do? How you
[1:21:40] gonna do it? This is the part of its
[1:21:43] survival design. It is called the
[1:21:46] preffrontal cortex which controls
[1:21:50] decision making and reasoning. And your
[1:21:53] brain starts analyzing the issue almost
[1:21:56] instantly. That's right. To try and fix
[1:22:00] it, to try and make sense of it. This is
[1:22:05] called the problemsolving reflex. The
[1:22:08] brain, the mind hates uncertainty.
[1:22:14] So it constantly works to bring things
[1:22:17] into mental order or resolution.
[1:22:22] Let me catch. It will use the first
[1:22:24] thing it can grab. It will use fear.
[1:22:27] It'll use assumptions. It'll use your
[1:22:30] imagination. Somebody walk by you, they
[1:22:32] don't speak to you. The first thing your
[1:22:34] brain going to tell you, she got a
[1:22:35] problem with you.
[1:22:37] She didn't speak to you today. What is
[1:22:40] that? Church thoughts, assumptions. She
[1:22:43] may not just was thinking about it.
[1:22:47] How quickly does the brain try to solve
[1:22:48] a problem? Almost instantly the brain
[1:22:51] begins problem solving within
[1:22:54] milliseconds.
[1:22:56] As fast as 0.2 to 0.5 second after it
[1:23:01] detects a problem or an unexpected
[1:23:04] stimulus. This rapid reaction is handled
[1:23:07] by the preffrontal cortex. It is
[1:23:11] responsible for decision making and
[1:23:13] reasoning.
[1:23:16] Is this dangerous?
[1:23:18] Should I do this? What if God don't show
[1:23:21] up in time?
[1:23:24] My children get worse instead of getting
[1:23:25] better. Maybe they won't be saved.
[1:23:29] Trying to fix the problem. The Bible
[1:23:32] says take no thought for your life. That
[1:23:37] does not mean you can that thoughts
[1:23:38] won't come. But the Bible says don't be
[1:23:40] anxious about it. Don't worry about it.
[1:23:43] Amen. Because the Lord is my shepherd.
[1:23:46] The shepherd is responsible for who? The
[1:23:49] sheep. Amen. Do y'all realize if the
[1:23:51] sheep the shepherd don't feed the sheep,
[1:23:54] they will die.
[1:23:56] They not going to have the understanding
[1:23:58] if the shepherd ain't here, we got to go
[1:24:00] find us. They will sit right there and
[1:24:02] starve because they understand my
[1:24:06] dependence is on him. They don't be
[1:24:09] thinking in their mind what we going to
[1:24:10] do y'all. We ain't got no food. The
[1:24:11] shepherd gone. They'll sit right there.
[1:24:15] And that is where God wants us to be.
[1:24:16] Church never anxious about things. Amen.
[1:24:20] Because And that that is hard to do
[1:24:22] because your brain is wired to try to
[1:24:24] figure it out on your own. Amen. How I'm
[1:24:27] going to fix this. And it's hard to let
[1:24:29] go. Amen. It's hard to surrender all.
[1:24:32] It's hard to move yourself out of the
[1:24:33] way because of this brain, this mind.
[1:24:37] Amen. Amen. Amen. That means the moment
[1:24:41] a problem enters into your awareness,
[1:24:44] your brain automatically starts looking
[1:24:46] for solutions, explanations,
[1:24:49] patterns, past experiences, emotional
[1:24:52] responses. That's what happened with
[1:24:54] Eve. She started to use her brain.
[1:25:01] She started to reason. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:05] Instead of taking that thought captive,
[1:25:07] what did God tell you, Eve? Amen. Jesus.
[1:25:10] Thank you. She start remember what I
[1:25:12] said before.
[1:25:14] When you entertain that thought, in that
[1:25:17] moment, you accept it. That's right.
[1:25:18] That's right. But here's the trick. You
[1:25:21] don't you're not going to know what to
[1:25:23] capture that thought with if you ain't
[1:25:24] in this book. M when Jesus was in the
[1:25:27] wilderness, he didn't have to go, "Well,
[1:25:28] let me go back to church and ask the
[1:25:29] pastor. Let me go back home and study."
[1:25:31] It was immediate. He didn't have to
[1:25:33] think about it. Soon as the devil came
[1:25:36] with him, he knew man should not live by
[1:25:38] bread alone.
[1:25:40] He wouldn't it wouldn't it wasn't a back
[1:25:41] and forth. That's why renewing your mind
[1:25:43] is essential. Getting into this book
[1:25:45] because you the Bible said the prophet
[1:25:47] of God said you got to know the enemy
[1:25:48] and his tactics. All he gonna do is
[1:25:51] contradict this word.
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:25:55] That's all he going to do. Amen.
[1:25:57] Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] All right. That's why we we understand
[1:26:00] that our confessions have to be always
[1:26:02] positive and ne and never negative.
[1:26:03] Amen. Amen. Um does this thought agree
[1:26:06] with the word of God? That's should be
[1:26:07] the question we ask ourselves. Hebrews
[1:26:09] 4:12 says and we are discerner of the
[1:26:11] thoughts and intents of the heart. Once
[1:26:13] you identify it don't line up with the
[1:26:14] word of God. Don't negotiate with it.
[1:26:16] Don't reason with it. You do what? Take
[1:26:18] it captive. Amen. Just like the TSA,
[1:26:21] right? Uh, anybody who flies, you got
[1:26:24] something that don't belong on that
[1:26:25] plane and they don't negotiate.
[1:26:27] You can't take this bottle on that
[1:26:30] plane, but I'm thirsty. We don't care.
[1:26:33] Amen. So, your this Bible church is your
[1:26:36] TSA. Amen. Don't negotiate. The rules
[1:26:39] are there. You capture it to the
[1:26:41] obedience of who? Christ. What did God
[1:26:44] say about that? And a lot of times the
[1:26:46] the devil, what he'll do is he'll he'll
[1:26:48] use conflicting scriptures, right?
[1:26:50] Somebody does you wrong. I'll use this
[1:26:51] as an example. Somebody does you wrong
[1:26:54] and the devil will come to you, you mad,
[1:26:57] right? He come to you and say, "Oh,
[1:26:58] don't you worry. The Bible says that uh
[1:27:00] fret not when when evildoers do wrong
[1:27:02] against you because he'll cut them down
[1:27:04] like grass."
[1:27:06] Yeah. God get him.
[1:27:10] Bless.
[1:27:12] God get him. Touch not my anointed.
[1:27:15] Then you miss the scripture in Proverbs,
[1:27:17] I believe, where it says, "Rejoice not
[1:27:19] when your enemy falleth."
[1:27:23] Just because it's right, don't mean it's
[1:27:25] the right spirit behind it. The letter
[1:27:28] kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Life.
[1:27:33] What's your motive? You shouldn't be
[1:27:35] feeling good because your brother over
[1:27:36] there lost his job. That's what he get.
[1:27:39] You reaping what you sow.
[1:27:42] [Laughter]
[1:27:46] church. Sometimes God will use the wrong
[1:27:49] in other people to help you see the
[1:27:51] wrong in you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:55] Amen. And I'm guilty of that. Sometimes
[1:27:57] I have to take a step back and say,
[1:27:58] "Lord,
[1:28:01] is my spirit right?" Yeah, they were
[1:28:02] wrong for what they did, but is my
[1:28:04] motive to get them to feel like how they
[1:28:06] made me feel?
[1:28:07] Amen. Because if that my motive, I need
[1:28:10] to be at the altar with them. Yes,
[1:28:13] that's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:17] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[1:28:20] obtain
[1:28:21] mercy.
[1:28:24] You know, I was uh
[1:28:26] on my job. This year has been a uh very
[1:28:29] trying year and I found myself in a
[1:28:32] place to I was having a uh a very bad
[1:28:35] week
[1:28:38] and um I got a got a phone call from my
[1:28:42] boss
[1:28:45] and uh
[1:28:47] he said uh he said man I'm looking for
[1:28:50] uh he was looking for a report or
[1:28:52] something around that and I as one of my
[1:28:56] employees employees I had sent an email
[1:28:57] to and I hadn't gotten the email yet.
[1:29:00] Now, I was having a bad week. I was not
[1:29:02] in a good spirit. Let me just put it
[1:29:03] like that. I was having a bad week, bad
[1:29:05] day. I was not not in the best of moods.
[1:29:08] And he called me. He asked for uh you
[1:29:10] know, where's this project results that
[1:29:12] I've been asking for? And uh the day
[1:29:15] before he had put me in his office and
[1:29:17] says, you know, Reggie, you're going to
[1:29:18] be doing a lot of traveling. Uh you're
[1:29:20] going to be all over the country
[1:29:22] basically. And I wasn't happy about
[1:29:23] that. Didn't seek God that morning.
[1:29:25] didn't pray like I was just just very
[1:29:27] disgruntled.
[1:29:28] And he called me, asked for the email,
[1:29:30] and I went to uh I stormed out of my
[1:29:33] office, went down to my my uh my
[1:29:36] employees office, and his door was shut,
[1:29:38] and I have keys to it. I didn't knock,
[1:29:41] didn't do anything. I didn't care.
[1:29:45] Stuck my keys in the door and I open it
[1:29:47] up and he's sitting there on his laptop.
[1:29:50] And I called him by his name. I said,
[1:29:51] "Mike," his name was uh Micah Cameron. I
[1:29:53] said, "Micah, hello. that email I sent
[1:29:56] you last week. Uh, what what's going on
[1:29:58] with it? In the middle of him giving him
[1:30:00] response. And I said, "Well, where is
[1:30:02] it? Why I ain't got it yet?" He says,
[1:30:05] "Mr. Armstrong, I'm sorry. I'll send it
[1:30:06] to you right now." Didn't say nothing. I
[1:30:08] walked out and shut his door. Walked
[1:30:10] down to another office and uh came back
[1:30:14] and he he opened his door. He said, "Mr.
[1:30:17] Armstrong, can I speak to you for a
[1:30:18] second?
[1:30:25] church. I'm If I can be real, we all be
[1:30:28] there. We all, but how do you handle
[1:30:30] those situations? Amen.
[1:30:32] He came to conform us. We're not
[1:30:34] perfect. Amen. Amen. So, I walk in his
[1:30:38] office
[1:30:40] and he said, "Rie, I want to tell you
[1:30:42] something, man." He said, "I could tell
[1:30:42] you're having a bad day, uh, a bad
[1:30:45] week." He said, "I've been noticing a
[1:30:46] change in you this year." And he says,
[1:30:50] "But you, the way you came in my office,
[1:30:52] that's not you." And let me tell y'all
[1:30:54] this. In this moment, there's a there's
[1:30:55] a battle going on in my brain. Amen.
[1:30:58] There's two dogs fighting one another.
[1:31:01] One dog is saying he deserves that. He
[1:31:04] should have sent you that project. He
[1:31:06] works for you. Who is he to tell you
[1:31:08] what you should or shouldn't be doing?
[1:31:10] And here's another dog that is saying,
[1:31:13] "Let your light show shine before men
[1:31:16] that they might see your good works and
[1:31:17] glorify your father in heaven." Amen.
[1:31:20] Amen. Let your light so shine before men
[1:31:23] so they might see your good works and
[1:31:25] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[1:31:28] You are written epistles. That's right.
[1:31:30] Read and known before men. These are the
[1:31:32] things that are fighting right now in my
[1:31:34] brain. Why he's talking to me.
[1:31:37] But as we know, when you've been
[1:31:39] studying and feeding on the right stuff,
[1:31:41] that dog you feed the most, is the one
[1:31:45] that's going to overcome. Amen. Amen. So
[1:31:47] in that moment, he tells me, he's
[1:31:50] pouring himself out. He said, man,
[1:31:51] because the person that we know, that's
[1:31:54] not you right now. He says, don't you,
[1:31:56] he said, Reggie, don't allow what's
[1:31:58] happening around you change who you are.
[1:32:03] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] Amen. In that moment, church, I had a
[1:32:09] decision to either reason and justify my
[1:32:12] actions or capture that thought to the
[1:32:16] obedience of Christ.
[1:32:18] Amen. I'm not perfect. But in order for
[1:32:21] me to grow, I have to realize like Peter
[1:32:24] did, Paul, you are right. I'm not gonna
[1:32:27] fight it. Amen. I'm even though I may be
[1:32:30] right in my standing, yes, Paul, I'm the
[1:32:32] elder here, but still the Holy Ghost on
[1:32:34] the inside of me won't allow me to to
[1:32:37] let this thing go. And I sat there. I
[1:32:39] said, "Mike, you right." Amen. I
[1:32:41] apologize. And I I thanked him. I said,
[1:32:43] "Thank you." Amen. Because sometimes
[1:32:46] God, we use other people, church,
[1:32:47] heaven. We can't have this mindset. I'm
[1:32:49] Holy Ghost filled, fire baptized. Who is
[1:32:51] he to tell me I'm wrong? If you wrong
[1:32:53] and it contradicts this word, say,
[1:32:55] "Lord, thank you.
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:01] That's why he came and he died and
[1:33:03] filled you with his spirit. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:08] Sometimes we have the mindset that soon
[1:33:10] as we filled with the Holy Ghost that we
[1:33:11] automatically conformed into his image.
[1:33:13] No, the potential is there you but you
[1:33:14] still got to work on that. Amen. God has
[1:33:16] given us the power to overcome. Let's
[1:33:18] give Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen.
[1:33:21] So renewal trains your discernment.
[1:33:23] Capture is your instant obedience. The
[1:33:25] split-second arrest keeps hell's lies
[1:33:28] from renting space in heaven's temple.
[1:33:29] If you ever applied for a apartment uh
[1:33:32] application or maybe you rent your home
[1:33:34] out to somebody, there's an application
[1:33:36] that you have to fill out. And if they
[1:33:38] don't meet all the standards, guess what
[1:33:39] you have to tell them? Thank you for
[1:33:41] coming, but you can't live here. Amen.
[1:33:43] That's exactly what you got to do to the
[1:33:44] devil. You you capture it. You analyze
[1:33:47] it with this word. And if it don't
[1:33:48] believe, if it don't line up, you tell
[1:33:50] it thank you, but you can't stay here.
[1:33:53] Keep it moving. Amen.
[1:33:55] So is it a sin to have a bad thought? I
[1:33:57] think we all know the answer to that.
[1:33:59] No. Right. So it it temptation is not a
[1:34:01] sin because the Bible says for we have
[1:34:03] not a high priest that cannot be touched
[1:34:05] with the feelings of our infirmities.
[1:34:07] But in all points God was what? Tempted
[1:34:09] like as we are but it was yet without
[1:34:11] sin. The same thoughts you have today
[1:34:13] that you're fighting with, Jesus had it
[1:34:15] but he did not sin. Amen. So that means
[1:34:17] he's given you the power to do the same
[1:34:19] thing. Right? So you're responsible for
[1:34:21] how you respond to your thoughts. Sin
[1:34:24] begins when you agree with the thought.
[1:34:27] That's it. That's all sin is. Once you
[1:34:30] agree with that sin, that thought, now
[1:34:32] you've sinned. Amen. That's what that's
[1:34:35] what Eve did. The first sin in the Bible
[1:34:37] started in the mind and she agreed with
[1:34:39] it and she started the reason. She held
[1:34:41] the conversation.
[1:34:44] All right. Um,
[1:34:46] where can I go here? I mean, let's go
[1:34:48] praise. I don't want to be long. I want
[1:34:49] to wrap up here. Um
[1:34:52] let's go to
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] let's go to uh Philippians 4 and 7. Let
[1:34:59] me skip around. So maybe I can finish it
[1:35:01] another time. So we understand that the
[1:35:04] the three concepts of of mind control is
[1:35:07] renewing the mind, capturing every
[1:35:09] thought. And my last point here as
[1:35:11] brother Ernest comes up is guarding your
[1:35:13] heart. Thank you. Or guarding your mind.
[1:35:16] Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of
[1:35:18] God which passes all understanding
[1:35:20] should keep your hearts and minds
[1:35:21] through Christ Jesus." When your mind is
[1:35:23] renewed and your thoughts are aligned
[1:35:25] with the truth, the enemy will try to
[1:35:28] come back and plant doubt, fear,
[1:35:32] bitterness. He will come back, church,
[1:35:33] and try to fight you. He came back to
[1:35:34] Jesus two times after the first time.
[1:35:36] Kept coming back trying from a different
[1:35:38] angle. That's right. Amen. Right. But
[1:35:40] here here is here is how we guard our
[1:35:42] heart tonight. Verse eight says,
[1:35:43] "Finally, brethren,
[1:35:46] Whatsoever things are what? True.
[1:35:49] Whatsoever things are what? Honest.
[1:35:51] Whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[1:35:54] things are pure, whatsoever things are
[1:35:57] lovely, whatsoever things are of a good
[1:35:59] report. If there be any virtue in you,
[1:36:02] if there be any praise, what in your
[1:36:05] mind, think on those things.
[1:36:07] That's right. I was telling the church,
[1:36:09] I said, a brother comes in and and you
[1:36:11] know, he may be late all the time,
[1:36:13] right? He coming to church, man. That
[1:36:15] brother always late. But at least he in
[1:36:17] church.
[1:36:19] You have to switch it up like that cuz
[1:36:20] the devil tried to you to dwell on that
[1:36:22] thing. And the only thing you'll see in
[1:36:24] the person is what they doing wrong.
[1:36:26] Amen. So this is how you guard your
[1:36:28] heart. You can call it your filter.
[1:36:30] Whatsoever things are true, is it real?
[1:36:32] Is it factual? Whatsoever things are
[1:36:34] honest? Is it sincere? Honorable.
[1:36:37] Whatsoever things are just, is it
[1:36:39] righteous? Whatsoever things are pure,
[1:36:41] is it clean? And is it holy?
[1:36:45] That's right. I'm going to keep moving
[1:36:46] from that. Whatsoever things are lovely,
[1:36:48] does it promote love, peace, unity, and
[1:36:52] brotherly kindness? Amen.
[1:36:55] I'm going to leave that alone, too.
[1:36:56] Whatsoever things are of a good report.
[1:36:59] Would this be pleasing to God if you
[1:37:01] repeated or shared it?
[1:37:03] If God was in your group chat, would he
[1:37:06] like that text you just sent out? Thank
[1:37:08] you. If God was in your conversation
[1:37:11] with your sisters and your brothers,
[1:37:13] would he be uncomfortable in that
[1:37:15] conversation? Thank you, Jesus. You have
[1:37:18] to ask yourself those questions. Amen.
[1:37:21] Because if you're not, church, that
[1:37:23] means that maybe the devil has caused
[1:37:25] you to build a stronghold in your life
[1:37:27] that where you've reasoned and
[1:37:29] justified. Amen.
[1:37:32] He cannot build strongholds in our mind
[1:37:34] until we give him permission to do so.
[1:37:35] Amen.
[1:37:37] You have to give him permission by
[1:37:39] reasoning. Amen. By justifying. Prophet
[1:37:41] God talked about when the lawyer called
[1:37:43] his uh IRS or somebody called his phone
[1:37:46] and his wife or answer the phone and he
[1:37:48] he says, "I'mma step outside, tell him
[1:37:50] I'm not there." And he steps outside
[1:37:53] and she answers the phone. He's not
[1:37:55] here.
[1:37:57] Next time he tries to heal a child, God
[1:38:00] corrects him. You told a lie. That's
[1:38:02] right. You got to fix that thing. He
[1:38:05] didn't make no excuses. He didn't say,
[1:38:06] "Well, I did step outside. God, I was
[1:38:08] outside." He knew immediately it was
[1:38:11] wrong. Amen. And he had to go make that
[1:38:14] right. Church, don't justify. Don't
[1:38:17] reason. If it contradicts this word, the
[1:38:19] flesh will want to say, "No, this and
[1:38:21] that." That is the devil trying to build
[1:38:24] a stronghold.
[1:38:25] And once you build that stronghold, you
[1:38:27] get delivered from certain things like
[1:38:29] maybe cussing or or lust. You're
[1:38:31] delivered. But when you walk outside and
[1:38:33] you justified, it's okay if I watch that
[1:38:35] movie. It won't bother me. Bless it.
[1:38:38] That stronghold is still there. Amen.
[1:38:41] And until you tear that stronghold down
[1:38:43] by taking every thought captive to the
[1:38:45] obedience of Christ, you give the devil
[1:38:48] free reign to wreak havoc on your life.
[1:38:50] He don't own this up here. Amen. He
[1:38:53] fights you there. But church, he don't
[1:38:55] have to dwell here.
[1:38:57] This is how we guard our heart. Amen.
[1:38:59] Let's give Lord clap a praise.
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:02] All right. Come on, brother Ernest. I'm
[1:39:03] going to close out with this with this
[1:39:04] quote here. So, but when the mind, this
[1:39:06] is from the uh greatest battle of the
[1:39:08] prophet God says, but when your mind
[1:39:09] closes itself to these things, he says,
[1:39:11] "And let God, the spirit of his word
[1:39:14] come in, it blows the rest of the stuff
[1:39:18] out." Amen.
[1:39:20] I'm going to read that again. But when
[1:39:22] your mind closes itself to these things
[1:39:25] and you let God and the spirit of his
[1:39:27] word, when the spirit of truth has come,
[1:39:30] spirit of his word come in, he says it
[1:39:32] blows the rest of the stuff out, every
[1:39:35] doubt is gone, every fear is gone, every
[1:39:38] sensation of doubt is gone, every
[1:39:40] feeling is gone. He says there's nothing
[1:39:42] standing there but the word of God. I
[1:39:45] want y'all to catch this. And he says,
[1:39:47] Satan cannot battle against that.
[1:39:51] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:39:52] praise. Amen. I'm going to go ahead and
[1:39:53] close here. Hope this was a blessing to
[1:39:56] you. Little quick thought, quick lesson.
[1:39:59] Um I trust it was a blessing to you. May
[1:40:01] learn with a hand clap of praise. Amen.
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] Church, take your mind back. We're
[1:40:08] living in a world today where people are
[1:40:10] people are going crazy. The time is
[1:40:13] filled with swift transition, but God
[1:40:14] has given us the victory on tonight.
[1:40:16] Amen. That's the word of God. Amen.
[1:40:19] Glory. Amen. You appreciate the word
[1:40:22] tonight. Amen. Mind control. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:26] Mind control. Amen. Let's give the Lord
[1:40:28] a hand clap of praise. Amen.
[1:40:31] Amen. Amen. So many things were said
[1:40:33] tonight. You know, I was thinking about
[1:40:35] how he was saying, you know, um, God
[1:40:37] come to fix you. Amen. And I was always
[1:40:41] go back in my mind to when the Lord
[1:40:43] first was dealing with my life. And I
[1:40:46] remember praying. I said, "Lord," I
[1:40:48] said, "I I need you to to help me." I
[1:40:51] said, "God, I'm afraid of myself because
[1:40:53] I don't know what I'm capable of." Cuz I
[1:40:56] know my grandmother used to always make
[1:40:57] a statement said, "A a man that don't
[1:40:59] fear God will do anything. And a man
[1:41:02] without the Holy Ghost will do
[1:41:03] anything." All it is is the mercy of
[1:41:06] God's hand on your life. Amen. And if he
[1:41:10] was to take his hand off of you, where
[1:41:12] would you and I be tonight? Amen. So, we
[1:41:14] always think that way. You know, a lot
[1:41:17] of times, you know, you look in in life
[1:41:20] and and like he says, the devil, your
[1:41:22] adversary, he's fighting you every day,
[1:41:23] every hour, trying to find a little way
[1:41:26] to get in. Amen. To knock you off of
[1:41:28] your place where you are. And then you
[1:41:30] can't pray like you are. Amen. You can't
[1:41:33] stand in the gap. You can't seek God as
[1:41:35] as you ought because you let the devil
[1:41:37] get in. Right. That's right. But one
[1:41:38] thing about it, I thank God for his
[1:41:41] spirit. Amen. because he'll help guard
[1:41:43] those areas, right? You know, the
[1:41:46] prophet of God, one thing he said about
[1:41:48] Eve, he was saying that that Eve her
[1:41:50] greatest mistakes was when she stopped
[1:41:52] to listen to cuz when she stopped to
[1:41:55] listen, he walked right into her mind.
[1:41:58] And you don't have to stop to listen to
[1:41:59] the devil tonight. Amen. You can keep on
[1:42:02] going by the grace of God. Amen. I thank
[1:42:05] God tonight. It was so many so many
[1:42:07] wonderful things that was said tonight.
[1:42:09] And and you know those things that help
[1:42:11] you. Amen. Get through the day. How many
[1:42:13] believe that tonight? How many was
[1:42:15] blessed by the Lord tonight? Amen.
[1:42:20] It starts in the mind. Amen. I was
[1:42:23] sharing with the church the other
[1:42:24] Sunday. I says, "Why we worried about
[1:42:27] this storm and and the wind and the
[1:42:29] waves?" I said, "Jesus out there walking
[1:42:30] on them."
[1:42:32] So, while we worried about them, Jesus
[1:42:35] out there walking on them. Amen. And
[1:42:37] then we would only stop to look up for a
[1:42:39] little while. Amen. and see what Jesus
[1:42:42] is is because what is he's telling you?
[1:42:44] He's bidding you to come. Amen.
[1:42:46] If he he's out there, he's letting you
[1:42:48] see that come on. You belong to me.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] You are in my hands, right? I'm in your
[1:42:55] heart. As long as I'm there, the ship
[1:42:57] can't sink. Amen. No matter what. But it
[1:43:00] takes your faith. How many believe that
[1:43:02] tonight? Come on. This is bringing out
[1:43:04] by faith and doubt. It takes your faith
[1:43:07] to rise to the occasion, right? Just
[1:43:10] say, "Lord, I believe you even though I
[1:43:12] don't see it." That's what faith is
[1:43:14] about. I don't see it. Come on. I don't
[1:43:17] feel it. I don't even hear it, but Lord,
[1:43:20] I believe it anyhow. Because God, you
[1:43:22] promised us that way. You stand tonight.
[1:43:24] Amen. Thank the Lord tonight. God is
[1:43:27] good. Let us bow our heads in a word of
[1:43:28] prayer. Amen.
[1:43:31] Jesus.
[1:43:33] Mind control.
[1:43:35] Hallelujah.
[1:43:37] God is good tonight.
[1:43:39] How many thank the Lord tonight? Oh yes.
[1:43:42] Did you get a word from God tonight?
[1:43:46] Oh Jesus.
[1:43:48] That's where it starts in the mind. Yes.
[1:43:50] Lord has a stronghold built up in your
[1:43:53] life. Oh Jesus. God I pray Lord tonight
[1:43:57] Lord as our brother poured out his
[1:43:59] heart. Lord God so many golden nuggets
[1:44:04] Lord passed out God. I pray Lord that we
[1:44:08] can see our faults, see our wrongs,
[1:44:12] God and Lord, move on from this place.
[1:44:16] Is that what you desire tonight,
[1:44:18] brother, sister? Come on. Is that what
[1:44:21] you desire? God wants to take your fear
[1:44:25] away. Hallelujah. And put faith in that
[1:44:28] place. Yes, Lord. The way you can say,
[1:44:30] "God, I believe." Yes, Lord. The devil
[1:44:34] shooting all kind of fiery darts, but I
[1:44:37] won't hear them tonight. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:44:39] going stand in the word of God. Lord, I
[1:44:43] believe you. Yes, Lord. Your word left
[1:44:46] your mouth and it shall not return unto
[1:44:49] you void. Lord Jesus. Yes, God. Casting
[1:44:52] down fear. Yes, Lord. Casting down
[1:44:55] doubt. Yes, Lord. Casting down
[1:44:58] everything that telling me I can't make
[1:45:00] it. Oh Jesus, I can make that.
[1:45:05] Because you made it. Oh Jesus, I'll
[1:45:08] overcome because you overcame. Lord, and
[1:45:11] my life is in your hand. Yes, Lord. You
[1:45:14] called me. Yes, Lord. And I'm still
[1:45:17] standing by the grace of God. Lord,
[1:45:20] Devil, get away from me. Get away from
[1:45:22] my mind. Get away from my home. Get away
[1:45:25] from my children. Get away from my job.
[1:45:28] Let hold my finances. Oh Jesus. Lord,
[1:45:34] you got to put it in God's hands.

[1:50:24] us tonight. Amen.
[1:50:29] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It is
[1:50:33] okay. Praise the Lord. I just wanted to
[1:50:37] testify.
[1:50:39] Um,
[1:50:41] last year I had been diagnosed with um,
[1:50:45] hypertension.
[1:50:47] I never had this problem in my life, but
[1:50:50] last year after I lost my mom, I think
[1:50:53] it was maybe the stress from that or
[1:50:55] what have you, but the doctor was like,
[1:50:57] "Okay, your blood pressure is really
[1:50:58] high and I know how I am." Okay, I know
[1:51:03] I know how I did you all hear me. Okay,
[1:51:06] sorry. I know how I am. I don't like to
[1:51:09] take medicine, but my blood pressure had
[1:51:12] gotten out of out of um whack. And he
[1:51:16] was like, "Okay, I'm put you on
[1:51:18] medication." Well, part of me was like,
[1:51:21] "I'm just not going to take it." But
[1:51:23] then I I had to humble myself cuz I know
[1:51:27] I said, "Lord, I know I serve a God that
[1:51:29] can heal." And it runs in my family. All
[1:51:33] my brothers and sisters are on
[1:51:35] medication for hypertension. So, I was
[1:51:38] like, "Okay, the devil thought he had
[1:51:40] me." So, I said, "I'm gonna I'mma take
[1:51:43] it. I'mma be obedient this time."
[1:51:45] Normally, I would just not take the
[1:51:47] medicine. So, I I I started taking I've
[1:51:50] been taking it for a year, but I said,
[1:51:52] "Lord, I know that you are my healer. I
[1:51:55] know that you are able to deliver me
[1:51:57] from this condition cuz many are the
[1:51:59] afflictions of the righteous." So, I
[1:52:01] went on and I was like, you know, this
[1:52:04] is supposed to just leave me. I didn't
[1:52:05] pray the prayer of faith. this demon has
[1:52:08] to leave out of my body. And so I made a
[1:52:12] deal with the doctor in December of last
[1:52:14] year. I told him, I said, "Well, I told
[1:52:17] him, I said, I don't want to be on
[1:52:19] medication anymore." And he said, "Okay,
[1:52:21] if you lose the weight, since I'm
[1:52:23] overweight, if you lose the weight, then
[1:52:26] you can get off of the medicine." And I
[1:52:28] was like, "Okay." So that was December
[1:52:30] of last year, knowing that I'm not good
[1:52:34] at losing weight. I didn't want to take
[1:52:36] Ozimpic. I didn't want to do any of
[1:52:39] that. And I knew I said, "Okay, I gotta
[1:52:42] do this." So, I prayed and I said,
[1:52:44] "Lord, give me a revelation to lose this
[1:52:47] weight so I can make the devil a liar
[1:52:51] because I am over I'm more than a
[1:52:53] conqueror over hypertension. I don't
[1:52:55] want to be on medicine." So, I said,
[1:52:57] "God, can you please reveal to me, you
[1:53:01] know, something about how to lose weight
[1:53:03] without making me sick? I don't want to
[1:53:05] be sick. Lord, let me be specific in my
[1:53:07] prayer. Amen. I'm not trying to be sick,
[1:53:10] but give me a revelation to overcome
[1:53:13] this weight and put the doctor out of
[1:53:15] business cuz I'm tired of going to the
[1:53:17] doctor. So, in January,
[1:53:22] miraculously, I just saw this app. I was
[1:53:24] like, I'mma try this app. And it it has
[1:53:27] some great recipes on it. So I started,
[1:53:30] you know, changing my eating habits and
[1:53:32] got a divorce from sugar and all of a
[1:53:35] sudden the weight came off. So fast
[1:53:38] forward to two 3 weeks ago, I went back
[1:53:42] to the doctor for my 6 month checkup.
[1:53:46] And it was like he came in the room and
[1:53:48] he was like, "Miss Nobles, you look
[1:53:49] totally different." Of course, I've lost
[1:53:51] 53 lbs by the grace of God. Who did it?
[1:53:54] Jesus did it.
[1:53:56] Because everybody in here can testify
[1:54:00] when we have events. Sister Kesha the
[1:54:03] first thing she eat is dessert. But I
[1:54:06] got a divorce from desserts and all of
[1:54:08] that. And that weight came off 53 lbs.
[1:54:12] The doctor said, he said, "You don't
[1:54:14] even look the same." I said, "I don't
[1:54:16] feel the same." And so I said, "By the
[1:54:18] way, doctor," I said, "I came here today
[1:54:22] to ask you, will you please let me off
[1:54:24] of the medicine?" I came went to the
[1:54:27] doctor's appointment expecting to be off
[1:54:29] of the medication. My blood pressure was
[1:54:32] 133 over 88. And he was like, "No,
[1:54:35] ma'am. You can't get off the medicine."
[1:54:38] And I said, "Wait a minute." I just said
[1:54:40] in my heart, I said, "God, I came
[1:54:42] expecting to get off the medicine. I've
[1:54:44] lost the weight. I came to get off of
[1:54:47] this medicine. And so he said, "Well, I
[1:54:50] tell you what, I'mma take your blood
[1:54:52] pressure manually and let's see if it
[1:54:55] has changed." So he took my blood
[1:54:58] pressure manually and all of a sudden my
[1:55:00] blood pressure went down to 116 over 88.
[1:55:03] So he was like, "Ma'am, you don't have
[1:55:05] to be on the medicine anymore."
[1:55:08] He said, "I'm done with medication and I
[1:55:13] am just so excited to God because you
[1:55:16] all know how it feels to have to get up
[1:55:18] and take a pill every day for those who
[1:55:20] know. But I just felt like I wanted to
[1:55:24] share this testimony because I know that
[1:55:27] sometimes when I rebuke spirits and
[1:55:29] stuff off of myself or go up for prayer,
[1:55:32] it's a time period. This took a year,
[1:55:35] almost over a year, but I am delivered
[1:55:37] and I'm just so thankful. And I wanted
[1:55:40] to share it not because I'm it's
[1:55:42] anything about me, but I just wanted to
[1:55:45] be an encouragement to anybody else
[1:55:47] who's on hypertensive medicine that God
[1:55:50] can still heal hypertension.
[1:55:55] Amen. God is good. Amen. My come closer
[1:55:59] out. Amen. God is still a healer, ain't
[1:56:01] he? Amen. Y'all feel all right tonight?
[1:56:04] I I know. I wish I could lose 53 lbs.
[1:56:09] 43. I'm going to take it captive. We
[1:56:11] going to take it captive tonight. Amen.
[1:56:13] I'm going to lose 53 lbs. 33 at least.
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:27] And we let us stand tonight. How many
[1:56:29] you enjoy the word joy and testimony?
[1:56:32] Amen. Really appreciate brother
[1:56:36] watch. We will do this series back.
[1:56:38] Amen. On captivity of the mind. Amen. So
[1:56:41] you give us some more info. Amen. To
[1:56:44] keep on. Amen. But God is good. Amen.
[1:56:47] Let us just bow. Heavenly Father,
[1:56:51] Lord, you're still proving and showing,
[1:56:55] Lord God, that you never lost your
[1:56:57] power.
[1:56:59] Lord, the word God has the same effect
[1:57:03] if we only can apply that, Lord. God, we
[1:57:07] want to take these things in, Lord God.
[1:57:10] And we want to take back, Lord, what the
[1:57:13] devil has stolen from us, Lord. You
[1:57:16] stole our confession,
[1:57:20] Lord God. Whatever we speak, Lord, out
[1:57:23] of our mouth, Lord, and we want to have
[1:57:26] positive thoughts and positive word,
[1:57:30] Lord. So help us, oh God, to be
[1:57:32] obedient, oh God, to the word. And we
[1:57:35] heard tonight, Lord, and bless, oh God,
[1:57:38] the people of God everywhere as we leave
[1:57:40] this place, Lord, but never your
[1:57:41] presence, God. Bless our pastor, Lord,
[1:57:44] and keep him, Lord. We ask these
[1:57:46] blessing upon brother Matias and family
[1:57:49] Lord God in the ministry Lord we ask
[1:57:51] these things in Jesus name and the
[1:57:54] church said amen.
