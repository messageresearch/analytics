[36:24] the book of Exodus the 12th chapter
[36:27] began to reading at the 12th through the

[36:32] we read the 13 together
[36:35] amen
[36:40] the prophet said when the bride
[36:42] recognized who she is then the Rapture

[36:50] amen you can't get to heaven
[36:52] unless and you recognize you're in
[36:55] Heavenly places now
[36:57] you would never make it there until you

[37:01] as those that can identify themselves
[37:05] with the word
[37:06] praise God when the Bible you know many
[37:10] times we say when we get to heaven we're
[37:11] going to sing and shout if you don't do
[37:13] it now you ain't gonna do it then
[37:15] praise God you wouldn't know what to do
[37:17] in heaven if you don't know what to do
[37:19] now
[37:20] praise God if you don't praise him now
[37:22] you won't praise him when you get to
[37:23] heaven
[37:25] if you don't lift him up now you won't
[37:27] lift him up then

[40:43] pass over you and the plague shall not
[40:46] come upon you to destroy you when I
[40:50] smite the land of Egypt my god let's
[40:52] read this words you may be seated
[40:55] um
[40:57] we're living in the evening time
[41:01] in the evening light messages come
[41:04] as a token to you and I
[41:07] so by the grace of God
[41:10] there was a message that came
[41:13] in the evening time of The Exodus out of
[41:18] Egypt
[41:20] God sent a messenger with a message
[41:23] are you with me
[41:25] and that messenger Moses was sent
[41:28] to get the people out of bondage
[41:32] are you with me
[41:34] and it was going to be quite a task
[41:37] because
[41:38] this was the greatest
[41:41] oh world power
[41:45] on the earth at that time the Egypt
[41:48] the Egyptians
[41:51] they ruled the world
[41:54] but yet God did not use the military
[41:57] force
[41:58] but he used a one-man invasion
[42:03] he told Moses I want you to go down to
[42:07] Egypt
[42:08] and I want you Amen to tell pharaoh to
[42:12] let my people go
[42:16] you know we are in sin is the type of
[42:19] Egypt
[42:21] and sin is a type of bondage
[42:24] and all the demons in hell in the
[42:27] spiritual realm are holding people in
[42:30] sin and in bondage
[42:33] and those demons amen they will not let
[42:36] you go free
[42:40] except God's sin
[42:43] of Moses
[42:45] God sent a angel with a message
[42:50] a message of Deliverance
[42:53] so God sent Moses but
[42:57] God that sent him God in him
[43:01] when God sent you he got he gets in you
[43:06] an authority that you have
[43:09] praise God is the authority that heaven
[43:13] is backing you up
[43:16] and if you got all Heaven on your side
[43:18] then all hell hell can be against you
[43:22] amen by the gates of hell should not
[43:25] prevail
[43:27] are you with me
[43:28] because your backing is all Heaven is
[43:31] with me
[43:32] amen if God be with us
[43:36] then who's favorable now
[43:38] well all the Demons of Hell cannot
[43:42] withstand
[43:44] and this morning I talked about the
[43:46] blood is the token
[43:49] the blood is the token
[43:52] and I want you to I want to remind you
[43:54] that the blood will never
[43:57] lose its power
[44:01] the blood will never
[44:04] lose its power I don't care amen
[44:08] what comes what goals and what is and
[44:10] what has been the blood will never
[44:15] lose its power
[44:17] praise God it's power
[44:20] in the blood
[44:22] in working power
[44:24] in the blood
[44:27] praise God thank God for the blood
[44:30] Hallelujah y'all don't want to get too
[44:31] excited ahead of myself but it's Power
[44:34] in the Blood
[44:37] God in my spirit as we were in prayer
[44:40] yesterday at the church and I I wanted
[44:43] to write but I had left my pen somewhere
[44:45] in the back and I said let me just pause
[44:49] for a moment that the blood has never
[44:53] lost his power
[44:55] praise God I thank God for the token
[44:58] this morning
[44:59] amen the token that has been applied in
[45:02] the evening time
[45:04] praise God Amen the prophet of God
[45:06] talked about the water age and praise
[45:09] God then he talked about the blood age
[45:11] and then he talks about amen
[45:14] the token age amen the Holy Ghost
[45:19] talking age the Holy Ghost is applied in
[45:22] this age amen
[45:25] praise God we had the water in the days
[45:27] of Noah we had the blood that Jesus
[45:29] shared now we have the Holy Ghost age
[45:32] amen
[45:33] so the token must be applied in this age
[45:38] praise God I thank God that we're in the
[45:40] time where the token can be applied
[45:45] amen I I'm so glad that amen the blood
[45:48] has never and will never lose its power
[45:52] and that's what happens to folk when
[45:55] their minds amen they don't have
[45:57] confidence in this sacrifice
[46:01] when you amen bring your sacrifice for
[46:05] sin they bought amen their sin sacrifice
[46:09] and they put their hand on the head of
