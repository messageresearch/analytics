[19:00] second peter the third chapter
[19:03] we thank the lord
[19:09] it won't be long and soon we'll be
[19:11] leaving here
[19:15] second peter the third chapter
[19:21] it says in the third verse ii peter
[19:24] three
[19:25] and three says
[19:28] knowing this knowing
[19:32] this verse that there should come in the
[19:35] last days
[19:37] scoffers walking after their own
[19:40] lust and saying where's the promise of
[19:44] his coming
[19:45] but since your fathers fell asleep all
[19:47] things contingent
[19:49] as it were from the beginning of
[19:51] creation
[19:53] for this they're willingly ignorant of
[19:55] that by the word of god the heavens were
[19:57] of old and the earth standing out of the
[19:58] water
[19:59] in the water whereby the world
[20:03] the then was being over flooded with
[20:05] water perish
[20:07] but the heavens and earth which are now
[20:11] by the same word are kept in store
[20:13] reserving the fire against the day of
[20:15] judgment and prediction of ungodly men
[20:18] but beloved we're not ignorant of this
[20:21] one thing
[20:23] one day is with the lord it's a thousand
[20:26] years and a thousand years is one day
[20:29] the lord is not slight concerning his
[20:31] promises
[20:33] some as some count slightness but is
[20:37] long-suffering to us one not willing in
[20:40] any should perish but that all should
[20:42] come to repentance
[20:43] but the day of the lord will come as a
[20:46] thief in the night
[20:48] in which the heavens shall pass away
[20:51] with the great noise and the elements
[20:53] shall melt with the fervent heat
[20:56] and the earth also and the works
[20:59] that are there in shall be burned
[21:04] up sin that all these things
[21:07] shall be dissolved what might a person
[21:09] ought we to be in all holy conversation
[21:12] to god
[21:13] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[21:15] of the day
[21:16] of god when the heavens being on fire
[21:19] shall be dissolved
[21:21] the elements shall melt with the fervent
[21:23] heat nevertheless we are calling this
[21:25] promise look for a new heaven
[21:27] and a new earth when dwelleth
[21:29] righteousness
[21:30] god bless you in this word may be seated
[21:35] today we want to talk about the coming
[21:37] of the lord
[21:38] as we go to matthew 24 the coming of the
[21:41] lord
[21:42] surely that has
[21:46] been it has been sounded out that
[21:50] god the lord jesus is coming
[21:54] then it's been sounded out this morning
[21:58] that the day of the lord
[22:02] and sometimes we have a little trouble
[22:04] hearing
[22:05] i hope you can hear all right
[22:10] because i'm not really uh
[22:14] raising my voice too loud
[22:17] sometimes they say i overdo it
[22:20] so by the grace of god i hope you can
[22:23] hear all right
[22:28] matthew 24
[22:32] and 3 says
[22:37] and as he sat upon the mountain of olive
[22:41] the disciples came to him privily
[22:45] saying tell us
[22:48] when shall these things be what shall be
[22:52] the sign of thy coming
[22:55] and of the end of the world
[22:58] and jesus answered and said unto them
[23:00] take heed that no man deceive you
[23:03] for many shall come in my name
[23:07] saying i'm christ and shall
[23:10] see many and you shall hear
[23:14] of walls and rumors of walls see that
[23:17] you'll be not
[23:17] troubled all these things must come to
[23:20] pass but the
[23:22] end is not yet for nations shall rise
[23:25] against nations and kingdoms against
[23:27] kingdoms
[23:28] and there shall be famines and
[23:30] pestilence and earthquakes
[23:33] and diverse places all these
[23:37] are the beginning of sorrow
[23:41] we look at the disciples
[23:45] wanted to know when to end what's going
[23:47] to come
[23:49] lord the coming of the lord
[23:54] as we look at it today
[23:57] is that that we are resting upon a
[23:59] promise
[24:01] that jesus christ
[24:04] will come again in his corporate body
[24:09] the bible talks about the lord
[24:11] descending
[24:13] from heaven the people
[24:16] of god that are believers
[24:20] are trusting that one day
[24:24] this world that's full of turmoil and
[24:26] trouble and chaos
[24:30] talk about the earthquakes and the
[24:32] pestilence and
[24:33] the different things that will take
[24:35] place
[24:38] when they ask what be the signs of your
[24:40] coming
[24:43] all these things we are experiencing now
[24:48] and because we are experiencing all
[24:50] these things
[24:54] but i want to use a little sub
[24:57] topic today as we go to thessalonians
[25:02] 1 and 5 as a thief
[25:06] in the night he's coming
[25:11] but i'm afraid that many
[25:14] will recognize it too late
[25:19] many will wake up
[25:22] out of their sleep
[25:25] and it'll be too late
[25:28] brother and sister
[25:32] may i have your attention
[25:36] see the word of god is trying
[25:41] to tell us something
[25:44] but i'm afraid that
[25:48] as one writer said i is a dull
[25:53] of hearing
[25:57] jesus told the jews you have eyes to see
[26:00] but you see not is to hear but you don't
[26:04] hear
[26:08] brother and sister takes a born again
[26:10] believer
[26:14] as he told nicodemus except the man be
[26:16] born again
[26:18] he cannot see cannot understand the
[26:20] kingdom of god
[26:24] brother and sister the bible says in the
[26:26] last days men will be lovers of
[26:28] themselves
[26:32] i believe we're more concerned about
[26:34] ourselves
[26:37] then we're concerned about the kingdom
[26:40] of god
[26:45] i heard the word of god says that
[26:49] in ii corinthians 13
[26:52] examine yourself see whether or not
[26:56] you're in the faith or not
[27:00] brethren says it's time for us to take
[27:02] an examination
[27:05] because the lord is coming
[27:08] and if he's coming brother and sister
[27:12] have we examined ourselves
[27:16] take a good look at yourself where are
[27:20] you
[27:22] if he should come today
[27:26] am i ready to go with him
[27:30] brother and sister i want you to take
[27:34] an earnest and sincere
[27:37] examination
[27:40] but as i was praying
[27:45] sometimes we have our pity parties
[27:50] sometimes we go through
[27:53] our journal for tree experience
[27:58] and we're more concerned about our
[28:01] feelings
[28:04] we're more concerned about our problems
[28:06] and our conditions
[28:09] and what we have been through and what
[28:12] we are going through
[28:15] our minds are being confronted
[28:21] and we seem as though we're living in a
[28:23] world
[28:25] what we're reaching out and you join to
[28:28] be loved
[28:31] and we wonder if anybody cares about us
[28:34] as individuals
[28:37] but our focus should be on the coming of
[28:40] the lord
[28:43] for he'll come and i hold that to think
[28:46] not
[28:48] he'll come in a time when you
[28:53] a sex senator
[28:56] so much concern about you
[29:00] your feelings what you're going through
[29:07] rather than sister if jesus would have
[29:10] took
[29:10] time out to care
[29:14] about what he was going through and
[29:18] the pressure that was on him
[29:22] but brother and sister he saw something
[29:26] he saw amen you and i and
[29:29] one day we would need a savior
[29:34] we would need healing
[29:37] we would need peace
[29:41] he knew that he was the bridge
[29:45] that would bring man and god back
[29:47] together
[29:52] and if he did not come and do
[29:57] what god had ordained for his life
[30:02] he knew that he had a purpose for coming
[30:06] and that was to do the will of god
[30:11] so he was more concerned
[30:15] about the purpose in which he was born
[30:19] and what he came to do
[30:24] i'm saying brothers and sisters let's
[30:27] keep
[30:27] focus our lord is coming
[30:32] back again
[30:35] he's coming to get us out of this
[30:38] pet's house but you and i
[30:42] must look at the condition of the world
[30:46] and say lord
[30:50] who has done me wrong
[30:54] i want to know why am i going through
[30:56] the things that i'm going through why
[30:58] the world
[30:59] in the condition that is in
[31:04] what about these pestilence what about
[31:07] this uh uh a virus and what about
[31:10] amen all the chaos that are happening in
[31:13] the cities
[31:14] and then in the area amen all of the
[31:17] division and all the devices
[31:21] brother and sister
[31:25] we got to look beyond
[31:29] what's going on in our physical realm
[31:34] for that is the spiritual realm that we
[31:36] must embrace
[31:40] they are the place that god wants you
[31:43] to enter into that you might have the
[31:46] mind of god
[31:48] and know the will of god for your life
[31:53] yes there are pressures that are
[31:56] crushing you
[31:58] yes there are obstacles that are in your
[32:00] way
[32:03] and you can't seem to break away
[32:06] from whatever you're going through
[32:10] they're family problems
[32:14] there's a war going on within the inside
[32:17] of you
[32:21] but brother and sisters
[32:24] god wants to take you out of that
[32:28] frustration and that aggravation
[32:31] and bring you the place of peace
[32:36] coming of the lord first thessalonians
[32:40] 5.
[32:43] he's coming and it's coming
[32:48] the bible talks about as a thief in the
[32:51] night
[32:54] he said but this but of the times
[32:59] and seasoned brethren
[33:02] you have no need that i write unto you
[33:07] for yourself know perfectly that the day
[33:10] of the lord
[33:10] shall cometh as a thief in the night
[33:16] for when they shall say peace and safety
[33:21] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[33:24] as travail upon a woman with
[33:27] a child and they shall not escape
[33:32] but ye brethren
[33:36] are not in darkness that that day shall
[33:39] overtake you as a thief
[33:44] we must understand that
[33:47] the day it's coming the day of the lord
[33:50] when judgment will strike the earth
[33:55] where the elements gonna melt with the
[33:57] firm and heat
[34:00] but that day should not overtake you
[34:04] they meant as a thief
[34:08] god amen said it won't take you like a
[34:11] thief
[34:13] the coming of the lord the lord gonna
[34:15] come and he's gonna judge
[34:17] the world in righteousness
[34:21] but that they should not take you as a
[34:23] thief
[34:27] there must be a people on the earth
[34:31] that are exemplified and they meant that
[34:34] i'm
[34:35] manifesting them that are chosen amen
[34:39] and ordained amen to go through their
[34:42] trials and detach
[34:44] amen and the face cycles circumstances
[34:47] and condition
[34:49] and come out victorious
[34:53] by the people that are made and ordained
[34:58] for this day
[35:01] that would be real soldiers of the cross
[35:05] and real warriors
[35:08] that know what god wants to do with the
[35:11] word
[35:13] they know their place in their position
[35:17] to understand amen what god has obtained
[35:21] and called them for for the
[35:25] hour is late but we're in
[35:28] translation time
[35:31] they make the shout has come forth
[35:35] they meant the force had called us
[35:39] to resurrection power for
[35:42] seven thunders out of their voice
[35:45] and when the seventh thunder's out of
[35:47] divorce
[35:49] john didn't say i sealed it up at the
[35:52] time of the
[35:53] until the time of the end but the time
[35:56] of the end has come
[35:58] and it depended again and the condos
[36:02] amen of the opening of the word
[36:06] it's here the book is open
