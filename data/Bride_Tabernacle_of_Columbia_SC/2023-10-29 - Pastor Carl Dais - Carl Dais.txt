every visitor and friend saints of God come to hear your word I pray you feel their needs this morning and their desires for we love you now in Jesus name amen as we stand the book of Romans 10 Romans 10 try not to be too long this morning Romans 10 and N if you have it say Amen the scripture says that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of where you may be seated I thought this morning have faith in God have faith in God now we know faith is a funny thing cuz sometime people think they got faith and they don't have it and sometime they have faith and they don't have it so when you look at Faith it's a firm persuasion the scriptures that you read and that you study and you pray it confirms your ID ity in God so when your faith is tested is tested to a point where God said I'm going to see whether you have faith today so he'll sent a sickness or sent a situation and he'll see what you got now Romans 10:9 said if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth confessing with the mouth and believing thine heart so the confession that you make with your mouth you must believe it in your heart heart so you just can't be just saying something there must be faith in what you say it must go deeper and penetrate into the heart because the devil is going to try you he's going to test your faith in what you believe if you say I got faith in God and I said Lord you know you got faith he's going to test it amen he's going to test your faith St John 1 St John 1 and 43 and it says the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and sa unto him follow me now Philip was a Bethesda the city of Andrew and Peter and Philip finding nathon said unto him we found we found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth and the son of Joseph the son of Joseph Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth and philli said unto him come and see and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said unto him behold an Israelite in whom there's no God so Nathaniel began to say some things about Jesus and didn't know Jesus was in his midst and Nathaniel said unto him which knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee how about this morning God sees every one of you and I when we got up to put on our clothes God knew that we whether we come to church for Faith or whether we come to church for to cause confusion or we come to church to be the same or we come to church because we got something nice to wear a nice hat or something but he knows these things so he begin to talk to Nathaniel and begin to Nathaniel didn't know that Jesus knows everything as you sitting in your seat this morning Jesus knows your heart he knows your motives and objectives for being here this morning am whether I want to come and hear what the preachers say oh sin born man from remit preaching in Camden ain't much I got to say with what Jesus tell me see what I'm saying you come to see Jesus and I believe you'll get what you expect if you come to see him this morning amen I had Bible study with my mom last night about 2 hours I couldn't make it to the service brother what's brother Armstrong I said M I can't make it cuz I got to be with you tonight so we going to have Bible study we went over about 10 chapters in Proverbs then I begin to take over my sermon last night she said Son you don't W me out and I pray for us and our faith is the substance of things hope for us the evidence of Things Not Seen I said now your sickness can be brought subject to Faith I said all it take is a combustion chamber of anointing and you can walk out of your condition but it takes real Faith see Faith knows no defeat Faith Knows No Death Faith overcomes when we can climb down in faith faith knows no defeat Faith knows no enemy why because Faith overcomes amen now look what Nathaniel said Nathaniel verse 48 Nathaniel said unto him which knowest thou me Jesus answered and said him before Philip called thee when I was under the Fig Tree I saw thee and naani answered and said unto to him Rabbi th the Son of God th the king of Israel and Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these and he said unto him verely very I say unto you Hereafter you should see Heavens open and the angel of God ascending and descending upon the son of man so now Nathaniel said one thing and he said Rabbi now Jesus begin to tell him some little deeper things see Jesus want to take our faith into some deeper things he let sickness come he let all these troubles come in our life that Faith to rise up and say Lord I'm taking you at your word I'm taking you at your promise amen amen amen acts 4 acts 4 and seven now we know faith faith is right there it's now Faith is now for you and I that's so right now when you hear the word faith is now yes and you grab hold of that one word appreciate Wayne being here this morning now Faith it's Faith right now I said Ma just catch hold to one word amen one word that I'm saying and you ain't caught hold to your son you caught hold to Faith amen it's just one word in that scripture will ignite your faith and you can move into the promises of God one word catches your faith and ignites you and now you can walk out of your situation you can walk out of your condition it just take one word but it takes meditation and thinking on your mind just can't be everywhere you know some people come in church in their mind everywhere snap out of it you in the presence of Jes Jesus Christ you're in the presence of the mighty king this morning we all eyes no big eyes and little you we are all on this road as brother Dwayne said two weeks ago it's a way it ain't a highway it's a way that's called Holiness and the way should be called Holiness Holiness or I won't say the other part acts 4 and S and he says and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this Oh Glory to God by what power or by what name have you done this what did they do let's look at it what did they do then Peter filled with what the Holy Ghost he had done got his faith to the point where God recognized his faith and filled him with the Holy Ghost see you ain't even a Christian until you you feel then you on your road to fight see the devil got you until you're filled with the Holy Ghost he and then say then he said uh then Peter filled the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of what Israel so he was talking to everybody now now let's backtrack just a little bit before Jesus left he cursed and swear that he didn't know Jesus the lady said you was with the Jesus and the disciples he said I I wasn't with him Bo he was in a terrible shape but now over here when the day of Pentecost come look what he's saying this look what he says Israel and the name of Jes for be it known unto you all and all the people of Israel that by the name of who Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doeth this man stand before youold this is the stone which was set at not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there's none other name under heaven give among men whereby you must be saved see that's why I was telling my mom last night I said the name of Jesus that's when you calling on the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus there's victory in the name of Jesus and if you got faith this morning you'll call on the name of Jesus and say Lord I'm looking for a blessing this morning I'm looking for something this morning and Lord it can't be straighten except it be accomplished in my life I'm looking for Faith this morning and the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I need it here with me this morning I need the supernatural to take place I need the power of God to take place I got conditions I got situations I got problems I need Jesus to come on the scene and meet my request and you stay there until it's conquered under you that's the kind of faith it is the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God he wait 25 years for the promised son and the Bible said he staggered not as he grow older he got stronger in faith he got stronger in faith so sometimes your condition might get worse your situation or diabetes or heart trouble might get worse it doesn't show that God ain't with you it just shows he's looking at your faith and seeing where you can go I want to trust God amen the Bible said they were well old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be after the manner of six amen but the Bible says in Romans 4:19 he staggered not at the promises of God Amen but was strong in faith giving glory to God Abraham called those things as though they were and what happened they walked into their body change why we know that cuz aex said I want her amen she the most beautiful woman in any country the king wanted her so this morning your faith can walk you out of your condition into the very Promises of God faith knows no defeat it know it don't even know death why because Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead even if you dead God can bring you back glory to God and you ain't dead you just sleeping then he says crucified whom you whom God raised from the dead even by this man stand here before you hold this is the stone which is set at all of you Builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other but there's none other name under heaven whereby you must be the saved now let's go back to acts three almost the same page 3 and 12 he said when Peter saw it and answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel you at this or why you look so earnestly on us as though by our own power or Holiness we've made this man to walk the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of our fathers have glorified his son Jesus whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of pilate I'm wondering this morning is anybody denying him you might say in your heart I'm not denying him but your actions prove that you're denying him your actions prove that you're living just like the Dev you're the devil's brother or the Devil's sister you living just like him but you want the pre the blessings of God glory to Jesus I told the guys at work the management and everything in the managers meeting I said let me tell you something there's two things that I don't agree with if you doing the same thing you doing every day and you're looking for a different result it ain't going to work am you come in his job and do the same thing and you looking for a different result you're living like the devil and you say Lord I need your healing I got diabetes I got heart trouble I got all this but you're still watching more TV than the television sometimes it's watching you at night I go upstairs and turn my son on all his is watching him am I wake him I said you you watching the TV said yeah Dad I said no he watching you you see we doing everything and we asking for God to do something for us we ask him for faith in our lives but we want to run up and down to every store instead of get on our knees and pray and call on the name of God but still yet at the end of the day we said Lord it a't I still got this situation I still got this condition you know sometime people stay in the barber shop in the hapl longer than they pray that's what it is we got to examine what we doing we got to examine what we're doing the Lord got me you in the you in you in you in the garden long than you praying had to cut my time back said God some the God and have a lot of problems in you know a lot of weeds got to get them out but I got to pray more than what I mean to God see if you're doing anything that you're doing more than God then you got a problem I don't care what it is where it is how you doing it if you're doing that more than you doing God then you got a problem now look what he says you have denied him in the presence of PID when he was determined to let him go the Prince of Life and the prince Prince of death they denied the Prince of Life which was Jesus Christ and they took Barabas a murderer and he killed he he he was put in jail cuz it was a robber and then in jail he killed someone in the Insurrection you see they chose the Prince of Life and this morning if your prayer life ain't where it's supposed to be you you choosing the prince of death cuz Faith is the victory the Bible say you can't even please God without faith that's that's what Romans 10:9 say if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shal be saved so with the heart man believeth and with the heart confession is made unto salvation glory to Jesus when your feet climb down into the promises of God and grab a hold of Faith you can say Lord I got you Lord I got faith now deceptions of things H for I got deceptions of faith and you can walk out knowing that it's conquered under you amen yes you've denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but ye denied the Holy One the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of Life whom God raised from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses and his name and through faith in his name has made this man strong when ye whom you now see and hear ye the faith which by him which given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all amen see God will give you soundness he'll give you peace amen he'll give you what you desire this morning but it must be according to his Scriptures it must be according to his word am John 4 and 11 see sometimes we can do things the Bible said that Peter them after they took Jesus they went fishing and the Bible say they tall all night and taking nothing see sometime we can pray all night but we don't let Jesus come in cuz we doing it on our own ability yes we can pray but Esau prayed too and find no way for repentance even though he sought it carefully the Bible says with tears yes he prayed and he had tears but he didn't sort it carefully you see what I'm saying he did not enter into that realm and when your prayer life get to a point you enter in I told the Saints in Canon I when you enter into that presence in prayer you ain't praying no more amen it's what worship you're not praying anymore once you have entered in through your prayer it's not prayer no more it's worship now cuz now you've entered into a real as they call it the most holy place you've entered there now and it's worship he's speaking to you and you speaking back to him so now you've create a spirit of worship that now God has honored your prayers he pulls you into the Shak Glory of worship yes amen see anybody can pray for hours but when you enter in when you get to a place you can enter in that's what they did at the day of Pentecost they was in one card in one mind and they entered into true worship amen so why did Esau he sought it carefully with tears but he couldn't enter in Judas he cast out Devils he done all these things but he couldn't enter in what was going on it was representation by predestination you've been predestinated before the found found of the world to enter into the most holy place and that's what produces perfectness that's what produces perfect Faith that's what I'm working with the church on the position of a Believer see the position of a be justification you still in the outer courts sanctification yes you moved into the inner court with the Brazen ARA and the lava but now we're going into the most holy place and the Bible says in Hebrews 10 Jesus rented the veil in TW from top to bottom Glory so now the most holy place is not where Israel is it's where you are going amen when you go in prayer and you enter that place you are entering in as a priest a king glory to God why the Bible says in Hebrews in Revelation he now made you you Kings and Priests the Bible said he rent the veil in from top to bottom so now you don't need the priest to go into the holy place with you the most holy place you can enter there by your prayer into that most holy place and how do you enter that by continual consecration dying out to self don't let the devil use you anger beig backbiting hatred jealousy you enter in there by the blood of Jesus and the blood of Jesus not the chemistry but the life that was in the blood changes your nature and now you are the presence and walking Tabernacle manifestation of Christ Christ means the anointed one and you are the anointed one why cuz he's made you Kings cuz you got a dominion and he made you priests cuz you tired at the paps for service the priest is tied for service and what service you are in your prayer life ushers you in into the presence of the mighty king we'll get into it hold on glory to God John 4 And1 now this lady in John 4 she went from justification a sinner to justification into the most holy Place why cuz the Bible say she run in the city and told all that told her come see this man she was a prostitute so I wonder what nature she had I wonder what nature she had being a prostitute five six husbands and the one she met Jesus he changed her nature watch the scriptures watch the scriptures unfold for this woman that was predestinated by God in the kingdom of God 10 Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that said to to me give me a drink th would have asked of him and he would have given the living water thank you Jesus the woman said unto him sir thou has has nothing to draw with with the wh is deep and whence hast thou this living water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle he never said anything to denounce Jacob's will cuz he know there's still people going to Jacob's wh that was going to be Conor that's going to need a caror drink but look what he said Jesus said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen the woman sth unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither cometh here to draw Jesus said unto her go called thy husband and come hither see the prophet already showing the prophetic sign he already know what her condition was he contacted her spirit and he knew he had told the disciples go in the city and go bu meat cuzz he knew they wasn't converted yet and they would say something with him talking to a illan woman that all she was after somebody else husband now watch Jesus said un her go call thy husband and come hither the woman said the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou H has had five husbands and whom he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in thou sest truly so she told the truth the woman said unto him sir I perceive the thy Prophet see she's never saw this man but he contact her speed he know where she was coming from now but she had gotten put out of the mestic church cuz she was a prostitute she had gotten put out to domestic Church to Baptist Methodist message she got put out because she was a ill Fame woman now look what happened our fathers Worship in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem this is a place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither Worship in this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what for we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth see in spirit and in truth in spirit and in truth amen the pastor can pray for you but it's your own faith the Bible the prophet said it doesn't make a difference how well favored the man is before you he might can be a apostle of the ministry a bishop or whatever you want to call him he might be a great man LED of God and anointed of God but it's your faith we know some people that had gifts the prophet just had a special gift that was going to be expressed in some people like the Mexican lady baby died and the baby was brought back that was special gift but your faith this morning it's your faith this morning when you climb down in faith no matter how great the man standing before you that anoint you with all it is your faith all the glory go to God no man can get God glory this morning it's your faith if you healed no matter how many preachers go by the hospital and pour all on you it is your faith that heals you I'm believing in seeing now that when that person climb down in God and they take God by faith uh all we doing is Oh Glory to God uh Power meet power the power of the pastor the preacher and your power of Faith meet and damus is taking place damus that's power that's the power of God so don't never think no preacher can lay hands on you and you heal that's that's a lie that ain't even scripture if that's the scripture then the Bible said God get God don't get no glory because the glory go to the man all of us been born in sin shaping in iniquity come out from my mother speaking lie but God honors his life when he prays for you and preaches the gospel to you his preaching of the Gospel that's why the Bible say how are the Feats of them that preach the gospel of peace so they bring Glad Tidings they bring the word to you that your faith can be lift up by the word of God which is Jesus Jesus I share my glory with no man all the glory go to Jesus uh and if you believe in him this morning your faith has ignited and tooken Place uh and you now ready to lift off uh not an airplane not a jet but an astronaut you ready to to lift off and going to the places uh where nothing can follow you but believing and children of Faith uh the Hulk can only follow Oh Glory to God the eagle me and a guy was talking the Hulk can only fly follow him maybe about 200 feet but the eagle go up to 6 700 feet why cuz his feathers was prepared for it his feathers was prepared to go up into the Unseen he can go up there the Hulk can't see that high he'll disintegrate if he tried to get up there with that eagle why the eagle is a prothetic anointing and your faith has a prothetic faith this morning and you can reach into the promises of God and pull out every golden nugget that'll take you into the promises of God and cast out every devil every sickness every condition of Mind battles every persecution that comes upon your life you can cast it out by the blood of Jesus the blood of Christ can take it out of your life right now why because it's the minister of the sanctuary and the sanctuary is the true Tabernacle you have a true Tabernacle this morning that the Lord pitching not man his Tabernacle wasn't pitched by man it was pitched by God and the Bible says in Hebrews glory to God H the tri came out and the Tabernacle was it called of Judah in which the tribe or priesthood was not called why did he say Judah cuz Judah is worshiped as you worship Jesus you walk into your blessing you walk into your healing you walk into your PR why because you're a priest I can't preach like this in cam cuz I ain't got but a little spot I got I got be preaching against the wall amen God bless you but look what he says look what he says acts three I think I'm on ask three four and Jesus said un Her Go okay father verse 23 but the hour cometh now when the true worship shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now watch what the lady did play close attention what the lady did see I told my mama it only one word that I'm preaching to you having Bible study you you grab a hold to one word and you ignited see e took one word and throwed all of us into sin job 14:1 said everyone that's born of woman is full few days and full of trouble come forth from his mother speaking lies she took one word and thr us into sin now this woman took one word and brought her into her body change into her nature her nature was changed cuz everybody in the community know she was a prostitute so she had a prostitute nature but now let's look at what happened to her the Bible said she got converted the whole city off of her testimony the prophet said it too in having faith in God and he said in Jezebel spirit and different messages he showed the woman nature was changed by one word she entered into the holies of holies by the spirit cuz Jesus said I had to go by Samaria because it was somebody there that predestinated that woman was predestinated no matter what she did she was predestinated now she said you a prophet K and all of them said he was beur he was a prince of devils he was gluttonous all this stuff that said about Jesus and and John the Baptist but now watch what this lady say showing that you can take one word and walk out of your condition you can take one word and denounce every Spirit that's against your life you can take one word and cast cast out the jealous demon one word and cast out the backbiting demon one word and cast out amen vile conversation on the phone with other people one word and walk out your condition except you love that Spirit the Holy Ghost don't love that spirit it's to heal it's to crush and take away and bring you into the presence of the mighty king amen that's what he come to do that now Paul said I walk from glory to glory even by the spirit of God and Paul was a great Apostle so I told the guys there was only one man in the Bible that was ordained Apostle we can ordain anybody we want as an apostle but truly are they Apostle they not and the only apostle that I know is is Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ and when he got to the end of his ministry he said I'm a prisoner of the Lord he said I count it all Philippians 4 I count everything as D so his ability 20 years in the Roman prison he said I'm a prisoner of the Lord he was even saving people in prison I bet if some of us get throw in jail right now we'll lose our Christianity Oh Glory to God Paul said I'm sinning oh GL to pH Phil himon I'm sending him to you who he was y'all know who he was glory to God he said I'm sending to you this man that was your slave and he robbed you he took everything you got glory to God I'm sending him to you that he not only be a brother not only a servant but above a brother that's what Paul said Paul witnessed to him and ministered to him and converted him him in prison and when he got out of prison Paul told filimon to accept him as a brother in The Gospel this woman said unto him the Messiah is coming which is called the Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I am I that speak unto thee am he see he told him now look what he say and upon this came his disciples and marveled as he talked with the woman and yet no man said what seekest thou or what why talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and said to the men said to men now glory to Jesus come see a man which told me all things that I ever did is not this the Christ come and see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this to Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him so she converted the whole city off of her testimony in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying Master eat but he said unto them I have meat to eat that you know not of Romans 3 and come to a close being I'm too long up here Romans 3 and 25 3 and 25 Romans 3 and 25 whom God have set forth for to be a perpetuation through faith in his what blood to declare his righteousness from the for the remission of sins that is passed through the forbearance of God yes so now what Jesus done for you and I that word propitiation is to conciliate an atoning sacrifice so whom God has set forth to be a atoning sacrifice through faith through faith his blood was to conciliate your unrighteousness through the forbearance of God and that word forbearance mean to hold up hold up this person that's a sinner until God Saves them hold them up bear with them glory to God if they a sinner bear with them cuz you were saved by the same Grace that they need to come by so hold them up don't talk about them don't say bad things about him that's Glory see when you see who God has set forth to be a per situation he was the atoning sacrifice for you and I and until you get the Holy Ghost it's still an atoning sacrifice for you and I am and atoning Sack sometime we take the vice versa path when we figure we a Christian and we message Believers and we think we got the Holy Ghost then we get mean and arrogant and all kind of other spirits on us amen but I tell you it don't make no different if you're a mess believer or you're a sinner if you need to be conncted I'm going to give it to you and my wife has been helping me to give it to you with so much sugar and Grace that I have no other choice but to do it that way honey you shouldn't have talked to him like that I said well thank you Jesus you got to give them with so much love and grace or you can cut them up with the gospel and with the knowledge but that's won't save them you must bring them because you have have been saved by that same Grace the perpetuation through faith and the forbearance of God Amen bear with them hold them up Ure with your brothers and sisters that's still a sinner that still might not look like a Christian glory to God see we work on so much of looking like a Christian instead of acting like one and living like one see we put on a dress or nice suit and tie but we so far away from Christians Jesus called them white ex suppers full of dead men bones but act like a Christian look like a Christian glory to God Lord have mercy I got so upset with the guys at work I came in at 7:00 said y'all acting like the devil today you must be born again went ready in office as you must be born again now and stop all this foolishness CU Jesus is right here ready and if they say Lord I need you God would have feel them right there but sometime the heart get hard and then you have to beat them to submission amen but see God's Grace has to be with us and that what brings complete love and forbearance to endure with the sinner even our children we have to have complete love for our children amen I said Lord if I have learned this 10 years ago CJ he you have to love him it's hard to go beyond that but Jesus loved that sinner lady to the point that he had to send his disciples away cuz they were Halfway Christian they ain't had the Holy Ghost yet so God is teaching us to love your your children love your brothers and sisters and when you think you above them then you have great love for them amen cuz that's what draws them into the presence of the shakana glory amen and that is the power of the Resurrection through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness so when you doing you're declaring his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus see you believe Jesus to get saved you believe Jesus for your healing believe Jesus to save your brother and your sister in the church right beside you believe Jesus to save your children you have to believe but you think once you get saved and everything's over that's when the trouble start where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of Works n but of law of faith Psalms I'm Psalms 37 I could have quoted but I said let's read it Psalms 37 and four Delight thyself in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart commit thy ways unto the Lord commit that word commit means to surrender it means to relinquish all authority and power to Jesus relin wish surrender commit thy ways unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth his righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noon day amen faith is based on conviction faith is based on conviction and when the the conviction of God strikes your heart he gave one man one Talent gave another one two and he gave another one five it's according to what God saved you from if he save you from a condition of sin you was a rank sinner that woman at the well and that woman that was caught in adultery I was just witnessing the other day some people at the church at the hospital I said now Jesus they caught that woman in adultery and the reason that those men were mad I believe is because they weren with him I said Jesus wrote down the ground he probably was writing the name of the initial and he stood up and she said where your accusers she said I have none she said he said neither do I condemn you so if you got a sister or brother in the church that you want to hold something over their head in condemnation look at your sins and once you see your sins as Scarlet he'll make you white as snow she Jesus said go s no more he said where your accusers she said I have none she said he said neither do I accuse you so everything was white clean from that point on so why you holding something on somebody else head God bless you musicians if Jesus bear the cross along and all the word Go free there's a cross for you there's a cross for me I went to Camden to preach the gospel and to save them that is desire to be saved me and the brothers go to prayer on Saturday from 10:30 to 12: every Saturday and our prayer is add to the church Lord such as should be saved I'm wondering this morning if anyone would desire to be saved my coworker sent something to

pastor or a good Bishop get me off the cross with you but one said Lord smoke his chest remember me when you're coming to your kingdom amen he knew he was a sinner so he's asking for God who is rich

Resurrection which is Jesus Christ in you God sent me something and I'm going to read it to you he said the aircraft carrier Geral Ford in the Mediterranean for Israel Dwight isenhower in the Persian
