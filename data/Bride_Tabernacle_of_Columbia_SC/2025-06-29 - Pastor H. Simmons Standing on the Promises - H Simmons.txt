Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

We want to talk about the promises of God and standing on those promises that God promised you and I. Amen. Amen. You know, I I I was thinking this morning. I I thought about the kingdom and I says the kingdom of God and I said, you know, it's I was just praying yesterday. I think I started I says, what kind of people we ought to be. You know, God promised the children of Israel when they were in Egypt and in bondage and Pharaoh had them all in bondage and and God promised that he's going to deliver them. Amen. Amen. So all their life for 400 years they were looking Amen. for a deliverer to come. They would get out of that bondage. Amen. When they arose of Pharaoh that knew not Joseph. Amen. And he began to put hard taxes on them and make their bondage rough. Amen. This world is getting pretty rough to live in. Amen.

There must be an escape, a place that we can hide and shelter from all this that's going on in the world. The Bible say we in the world, but we're not of the world. Amen. So we come to a place and God has a provided place for worship. God has provided us. Amen. In this day, Amen. Praise God. God has given us a safe place that we can hide. Amen.

Amen. Praise God. A shelter from the storm. Amen. So I thank God that God has provided he he revi He provided an ark for in the days of Noah for Noah's to escape in. Now Jesus when he's coming he he started saying he sent John the Baptist said repent for the kingdom of heaven is what at hand. God's kingdom is has come. And I and I I want you to recognize that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but is righteousness, peace and joy in the in the Holy Ghost.

He promised them and the children of Israel promised them a land flowing with milk and honey. Amen. After all their going through, all the slavery and all the bondage, all the hard task masters, God said, "I I'm going to give you a promised land." Amen. Praise God. And I'm going to give you uh I'm going to give you rest. From your labor. Amen. You They They They had you working and they had you in bondage and in slavery. And we all were in bondage to sin.

Be baptized. Every one of you in the name of what? Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. And what? For the remission of your for the remission of your sin. And you shall what? Do you want it? Shake somebody hand and say, "Do you want it?" Do you want it? See, cuz some people get God got something he want to give you, but do you want it? Amen. What do you say? Take somebody else saying, "Actually, do you want it?" Amen. God, you know, you know, you try to give somebody something and they don't want it. Huh? You try to give them they Let me see. I Let me see what I got in my pocket. Oh, I ain't got my wallet. Let 20. Let 20. You ain't got 20. I don't want you to give me no 100. Now you got a 20. I don't care. God tried to give you something. Here's a little daughter uh that come for the first She ain't come for the first time. I ain't seen her in a while. Come little daughter. I want to give you something. I want to give you something. Don't. Amen. See, you got somebody want to give you something and you don't want it. See, she don't mind getting you don't mind it. Bless you. God bless you. Thank you. You see, somebody want to give you something, you got to receive it. Amen. Well, you know, uh, you know, we can give out everybody in here a $100 bill. And you probably say it's all right. And you say, "Everybody can go get a $100 meal." You know, if I had my wallet, I might give out a hundred if I got one and let you go get your meal. Amen. Right. Everybody want to receive it cuz they know the value of what? a $100 bill, right? But when it comes down to receiving eternal life or receiving the kingdom of God, the promise of God, you shall receive the gift of the what? Holy Ghost. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. But everybody don't want it. Amen. Because the reason why they don't want it because they don't know how valuable it is. Amen. Amen. What What can I get with this? If if I'm going to get it, what it going to do for me? Amen. And what can I do with it? That's right. Amen. I'm talking about standing on the promise that God promised that you shall, he said, the promise is to you, to your children, and to them that are what? Even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And look what Isaiah said. But who has believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. Isn't that right? Oh, he was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. And we hid as where our faces were. Amen. He was a rejected king. Is that right? Folks, the king was rejected, but we don't know. This is the king that come to give us a kingdom. Amen. Amen. A kingdom. Amen. Amen. So, you have an opportunity to come into the kingdom. But, you know, if you got to think about it, I got to think about this. Oh, if I had $100 bill and you had to think about it, I just keep my $100. Some of y'all $100 don't mean nothing. I had to go up to $500 for some of y'all cuz $100, it's like giving a child a dollar. Y'all got so much money to $100 mean a lot to me, but I mean it ain't valuable to y'all. Y'all got so much. But $500 might might make you more. But anyway, yeah, I was over in uh Jamaica, over in Africa sometime, and I would give them a $100 bill. Oh Lord, you ought to see the line waiting outside. I said, Lord have mercy. Oh think I'm rich. I mean, they be waiting because it's all in the value of what you have given. Jesus said, "I'm going to take you out of Egypt and I'm going to take you to I mean, uh, God said, I'm going to take you out of Egypt and I'm going to take you out of bondage, but I got something I'm going to replace it with." God. Amen. Amen. If he he wants you to give up sin, he wants you to give up the things of the world. Well, God has something better than what you Amen. holding on to. God got something better for you than what you're holding on to. You don't have to keep holding on to something. Amen. Praise God. That ain't going to do you good, but it's going to cause you to get worse. Are you with me? But God got something better for you. Amen. Glory. Y'all keep your eyes open. You might get the $20. Not talking to the children now. Amen. Cuz sometime y'all don't listen with. But it's got to be valuable. The word of God has to become valuable to you. Amen. It has to mean something to you. Amen. Cuz you know, it might be one of the billionaires of the world. Uh Eli Musk or somebody. I know you don't want to say that. Well, somebody Gates. Okay, I say something cuz sometime it becomes controvers but he's he he's promising you know I'm going to give somebody a million dollars. Amen. So you look at hey it's a possibility that I can get this million right. But here God is offering you something worth more than a million dollars. He said if you repent and be baptized in Jesus Christ's name that you shall receive the gift. Amen. You don't have to work for it. I'm going to give it to you. Amen. Amen. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And when I get baptized, I repent and get baptized in Jesus Christ's name. I want Amen. Amen. Amen. You know, if they said, "I'm going to give it to you," then Amen. Amen. And mom or daddy said, "When you finish high school, when you get out of high school, I'm going to buy you a car." What are you doing? Where the keys? That's right. Cuz you said that if I you complete high school, I'm going to get you a car. So what happened? Where the keys? But when you finish high school, something might happen. And they can't can't give it to you at that time. Ain't that right? Amen. But you said, "Well, you know, you can hold God to his promises." If God promis you something, he going to what? He going to keep his promise. God going to keep his promise. And you can say, "God, you promise it." Thank God.
