Hebrews 11. and 30. Hebrews 11 and 30 it says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after the working past about seven days by faith the ray the Holland rehab perished not with them they believe not when she had received the spies with peace may God blessed to read those words you may be seated in Jesus Christ's name thank God we wanted to talk this morning about Women of Faith Women of Faith amen women that allowed themselves to be used of God women that sacrifice their life for the purpose and the will of God and they understood that that God had a purpose in their lives so rehab the Harlem out of all the places in Jericho God sent despised to rayham it says it specifies that it was Rahab the Holland something that we were meditating on God doesn't care Who You Are away you are I want you to know he's mindful of you doesn't matter the condition that you're in God sees you and God knows how to find you doesn't matter where you are no matter what you've done Women of Faith you know God makes certain choices in this decisions he wants to find somebody that he wants to use and to be a light and sometimes the places that God goes to find these individuals it it just started the mind and I said sometimes when we call it thinking with outside the box God does you know we have a box so that we put God in sometimes God moves right outside the box and not the way you think he said your thoughts are not my thoughts so God can move outside of you oh the way you think and the way you will look at where God want to use the Women of Faith what kind of women are Women of Faith what kind of women did God choose and that seems as though those that things that those those things that are despised those things that seem to be rejected and those individuals that seem to be amen something that the you know the world will look down on God moves on past that and he sees amen he sees it real women now faith that can be used of God so on this mother day we thank God for my mother and amen she's going on but she set an example amen and we thank God for my wife and I look at the children and I oftentimes say thank the Lord for my wife you know because the prophet of God said a wife will she is a manifestation of who you are she would represent you so by the grace of God I look at the children and see the fruits of her labor and I thank God for her and this is our 29th anniversary and I know many folks take off and go brother Max sitting there and said some wonderful the anniversary too I don't know if Sister Lois and Pete had to work or whatever but that's it's their anniversary too foreign but thank God for God blessing the folks to stay together thank you brother Mike and running for 47 years and and uh 45 thank Peter Lord I mean feeding Lord's got y'all no they're getting about 40 something anyway 42 42 okay good morning too amen they beat me right and I ain't gonna never catch up with y'all the light and grace of God we thank God now Women of Faith we said look like God just thinks what's outside of the box and your choice is not God's choice and he said your ways are not my ways your thoughts they're not my thoughts so we want to go Mike here to when we look at rehab out of all the people that were in Jericho God sent them by a place of a woman that was you know you know no way a Godly person a Christian person a man a reputable character and supposed to be let's say he's a Believers Church goals are living Believers of the true Living God here they are going in to search out the country the spot and then God's Providence sent them to the right place at the right time send them to a woman or that's a Harlem and she amen she hid them stood in the Gap and then she began to talk to them about amen that she knew that they were gonna conquer the city and they were gonna amen destroy the city and so forth and she had confidence in them amen not knowing of strangers but yet she knew that their God was with them amen so even beforehand she amen she didn't see it but she heard about the God that they served and she heard about the God that was with them and she believed amen even in her condition she believed amen so she was able to amen uh because of her believing she put her faith in action amen she put our faith in action because she hid them amen and she protected them while they were in the city amen so by the grace of God sometimes our faith has to move out and just not saying I'm believing but I want to be used when I said Women of Faith the Bible tells us faith without works is dead amen so Rahab was used amen and I said if I had to put a little bit Women of Faith I said Use Me Lord Lord I want to be used by you amen so as we move on along we want to look at Luke 4 Luke 4. and I said thinking sometimes without the box and thinking God goes beyond the way we think and how we look at things and he just chooses whom he will does what he want to do uh Caleb you got it uh Luke 4 and 23 so by the grace of God look forward 23 God is good amen go right ahead and he said unto them you will surely say unto me this proverb Phoenician heal thy physician heal thyself amen whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy country he said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country but I'll tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was the life Elias sent saved unto servata a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in the time of this woman the god went all of Israel sometimes we need to look at different ones in them we said Lord use me why didn't you use me let's go to first king 17. why did why did God bypass me and go use somebody else that I you know look like I was in better positions he said many widows was in Israel but God didn't go to none of them are you with me but he went out to another country looked like a gentile country sometimes God will bypass what we think and what we was doing but he's he knows how to find who he can use you find somebody that he could use for the need for the purpose of the moment of the hour he finds somebody that want to be used even though she didn't even know what was in her until the prophet revealed to her that God wanted to use her are you with me so God wanted to use this woman and let's look at First Kings 17 and 9. kill him arise which belonged to Zion and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee look at God look at God I I commanded a widow woman to sustain you a prophet a man but I'm gonna let a woman sustain you God thinking without look like him your man but I commanded this with a woman to sustain you but I'm gonna command her to sustain you it's a famine in the land you know it had go ahead and read so he arose and went to verify and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me and I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called her and said bring me I pray the immortal bread in thine hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake nor a handful of but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks now I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we made it and die you know I'm asking you to do something you know most of us how we think God how you you gonna use me God's gonna take my last the prophet is asking for my last and I'm gonna I'm talking about Women of Faith it took faith for that woman to hear the prophet him what thus said the law it took faith for her to move you know if we we we're reading about things that happen in Bible days and then time passed but these things are written for our example amen that when we see scriptures that it might build faith in us that we said God if you did it for them you can do it for me if you use them in the condition that they were in can't you use Me Lord I want to be usually but this woman okay God is asking you to do something that most of us would question a man or woman but these are we talking about Women of Faith Mother's Day happy Mother's Day to everybody but this that's why we're talking about Women of Faith you know but it would be very questionable that we would even question God why you're gonna send this Prophet this man of God here at this particular time knowing that the condition that I'm in you know sometimes the condition that folks are in they choose rather you know I'm saying that I I I I it's me and my son and you asking for my last uh-uh see some of us make decisions based on Amen what we see and not what we say we believe see if you're going to have faith is the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things you want not seen it took amen this woman amen having enough faith I can't see it but yet I'm gonna believe it I don't understand where you're going with this but it's something not in our heart amen says you know he said thus said the Lord I I believe that this is something I I believe she believed that that was a man of God and you know he don't come all the way over here in this Gentile land which he's a Jew and he's over here with me and asking me to do something that seemed to be impossible see when God Moves In The Impossible and he wants to do the impossible for you God Moves In The Impossible and he wants to do that for you but yet sometimes because we question whether God is the god of the impossible and God want to use amen you for his purpose and for his will but many of us are not available there's no room I can't understand how I can even serve your purpose and your will in my life Lord what can I do most of the time we we're kind of you know reserve and so God has to bypass all of those that uh seems to be uh reserved and stuck up on themselves amen but God want to use somebody that's willing somebody that's willing to Amen to God used Me to Your Glory the event somebody that's gonna think without the box I'm not gonna be closed-minded I'm going without I'm gonna have faith I'm gonna trust God beyond the circumstances condition I know the payment is in the land and I know the amen the spirit of God is not moving like it used to move and amen we're not experienced amen wave after wave and the power of God look like it's not moving like it ought to move but God comes in a famous time a time of Fame and when amen it hadn't rained for three and a half years but yet God says to Elijah goes to that woman amen I'll be surprised as the Lord put these things in my heart it'll be surprising that God will bypass you know a lot of widows and go and find somebody amen that's out there amen that's wondering amen what am I going to do with my life what's my next step my life seems like it's perishing I'm down and out and I don't know what to do with myself that God will bypass amen those that were in Israel to go over here to this woman and ask her to do something that was very difficult amen would God speak to us and access to do some difficult things the Bible said he said I'm the same yesterday in the day and forever I'm God and I change not so if we understand how God worked yesterday and we know how God works today because he's the same God if he did it that way yesterday then God would deal with us in a spiritual Manner and he asks us about doing things that seem to be a little against the grain amen praise God these things amen we're going against the current amen you know Bishop Washington used to say any dead fish can go Downstream but it takes a live fish to go against the current are you with me so uh a lot of times amen we we can go with the flow but when you're going against the floor you gotta you got to have something to do that and I'm saying you got to be able to turn against the crowd against those that are all flowing in One Direction and you got to go against your grain you got to go against your current amen but you got to be alive amen you got to have faith to do that praise God you got to have I'm talking about Women of Faith amen that's going to look Beyond amen where everybody else is going and what everybody else is doing amen but they're going to take amen that's straight and narrow Women of Faith where did you stop it and die 13 13 and the largest settlements of her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me there for a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son okay I'm gonna tell you something things are gonna happen for you if you put God first things are going to happen seek ye first the kingdom of God his righteousness and things are going to happen things are going to get better but we take Women of Faith it takes somebody amen that's going to believe God somebody who's going to trust God things are going to get better but you got to do what God Said first praise God you've got to do what God Said first and then you watch God what he does for you once you do what he says First Watch what he do does for you amen but you gotta it I mean can you see yourself battling with it because you can't this is hard this is hard and I know God spoke to us in many occasions about different things in our lives but we struggle with amen I can't do that I ain't no ah that must be did not hear right no no he couldn't he couldn't have told me to do that no no no no no no no not me not that because he know if I do this then I'm gonna have he said it's not gonna run out amen amen things are going to work to your good amen listen to my voice and hear my word and things are going to work out till you're good it ain't what you can see it's what you can believe and things are going to work till you're good praise God you don't know how many blessings are waiting on you only if you would hear God only if you would listen to him amen you sometimes we want what we can see to bless us but you got to look beyond what you can see but what you can believe God wants to bless you but you gotta look beyond that amen but it takes faith it takes Women of Faith amen so Elijah told them what to do amen and and then then he was confident Elijah was confident and what he said he said y'all gonna have something to eat don't worry about nothing just just give me first but y'all gonna have something to eat do what God Said first and God gonna take care of Amen your knees go ahead on next verse but thus saith the Lord God of Israel the bearer of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent us rain upon the earth I want to reiterate the story of a sister over in India she was a little woman and she had ran out it was faming over there and she just had a little flower and all and and she prayed to God I'm that with a woman and for years the brothers the different missionaries going into you and they just go by that woman house and her flyover and all did not run out and they would eat one they wanted to eat one of those Supernatural cakes and it was I heard brother after brother said I went by there and I was able to eat one because see God is a present tense God he did it in Bible days but he did it in this day are you with me and that woman got a testimony today that God didn't there were Women of Faith in this age that was able to say the right thing as had the right sin ain't nothing but the truth Women of Faith amen there are people of Faith amen praise God so many things amen that my mom said I can see it happened boom boom boom amen and now Women of Faith that I I was thinking amen as I was I was thinking about the old sanction uh not in Maryland sister Lewis uh thinking about you know the Saints around here you know people that uh help you grow sister Johnson amen Storm Out on the Ocean she was and then Afflicted and amen they had to put a trach in but she kept on people that were pressed the battle you know what I'm saying press the battle don't matter what the circumstances sister may say then nothing can keep her from coming to church almost I mean she you know they're trying to doctor said no no no she wanted to come people of Faith they're gonna press the battle for people don't no matter how sick they were amen they want to praise God they want to give God glory they're not going to give up the fight they got enough fight in them to keep on fighting are you a man Women of Faith amen amen there are people that are setting example the stage for you right now women that are oppressing the battle your mothers that uh mothers that are a Sanctified mothers mothers that even live their life before the children they never seen them drink they never seen or smoke they never seen them to do certain things amen they set a good example for the children amen they're setting the stage that you got to Pat them so and they they they they're praying and brother Gordon said somebody prayed for me amen praise God I I saw mother Tate with her mind I mean oh I wasn't calling uh Alzheimer's or whatever you call it amen but she every time I was quoting scripture she was quoting right along she knew the song Amen why she had something down deep she had something on deep it was inside of her everything that's gone but I still got that word I'm holding on to amen I still remember that I remember the songs of you know are you up man see something you know people that uh uh caught a hold of something and they're holding on to them amen it looked like it's impossible but they they held on you those old soldiers that have said a good example amen Women of Faith Use Me Lord and these young people and young sisters uh amen you maybe you're not a mother yet but you want to be a woman of faith amen I I I've seen others that go forward I want to be a woman of faith I want to amen I want to be one that you're going to serve the Lord I don't want to never smoke I don't want to never drink I don't want to never curse I don't want to never do these things I want to be a woman of faith amen I'm gonna choose amen I want to be like Mama I want to be like Grandma I want to you know a person of faith are you up here Women of Faith that won't give up amen they won't give up on you let's go on to the next version Lord and she went and did according to the sin of Elijah and she and he and her house to eat many days the 16th versions in the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fill according to the word of the Lord which he spanked by Elijah I'm gonna tell you something God Will Never Let You Down um Ruth the first chapter God Will Never Let You Down it doesn't matter how long amen the famous last God had enough to take her through the fame because she put him first and I'm gonna tell you no matter how much trouble and how many storms coming in life if you just trust God put him first he'll sustain you he sustained you when the doctor shake the head God still sustain you you know if somebody says you know the women amen they had the children ripped from their stomach and all of that and they were killed they were so on the Sunday but they stood the test they were able to stand up for God regardless of the price of the cause amen they were put to death because they took a stand for God amen and I'm gonna say something about those women that that have been a faithful examples amen maybe they didn't look like amen we look today and maybe they didn't have amen but I think they the battles that they have faced is the same battles that we face but they're just spiritual battles and those spiritual battles that we Face we got to be mindful amen that there's no temptation taking you but such is common to man but God would with the Temptation he'll make a way of Escape for you so what you go into and what you've been through God is mindful of that and God knows how to make a way of Escape for you and you got to be well grounded to believe that amen God I want to amen take you at your word and I want to just be like them and I want to obey your word and I want to be like Sarah I want to be like uh Rebecca I want to be like those women in the Bible that I read about about Hannah and different ones they meant that could not have a child but God let them have a child think about sister Betty 10 years but God gave her a child amen Faith amen I'm going to keep on serving the lord God came by amen and do something for you amen God will do things for you in your life if you're just to believe I look at amen sister William and down there Mullins uh deep over there in Darlington amen wife was Barren for I don't know about 20 years and God gave her three children amen God is God you know a brother told me his wife had a uh but the Geo wife had something like a hysterectomy or whatever and somehow God replaced the organs and so forth and she had a child are you a man that's what that's the kind of dog we serve a God that does those things now I'm not talking my way back in the Bible days I'm talking about this thing I'm talking about things that God does for women now amen God does the impossible God can do it amen what it looked like is all over with God comes by 25 years had passed Sarah was old dried up but God let her have a child amen the amen God he's mindful of your circumstances he's mindful of what you've been through and what you're going through and he still says I'm gonna bless you amen if you just hold to God's unchanged in hand if you just wait on the Lord amen praise God God's gonna do what he's saying if you trust him and knocked down he will surely bring you out yes he will roof one and one in a reason I came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was payment in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judea went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and his wife Naomi in the name of his two sons Mylon and chill on Carol go ahead foreign and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and eliminate Naomi's husband died and she was left in her two sons and they took them wise of the women of Moab the name of one was Oprah in the name of the other Rule and they dwelled there about 10 years a mile on in China died also both of them and the women were left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return into the country of Moab from the country of Moab where she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people and given them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughter-in-laws with her and they went into the way to return into the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to their mother's house the Lord did kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grants you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me other than yet any more signs in my womb that they may be your husband turn again my daughters go your way but I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name our daughters for it is for grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and what again and over kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her she said behold thy sister-in-law is going back into her people and unto her God and to her what God's gods go ahead return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou go as I will go excuse me hold it now Naomi had a testimony you see what I'm saying when you got a testimony and that testimony is anchored you see what I'm saying Naomi had a testimony and her testimony was Amen exemplified in her daughter-in-laws but one of them she just you know didn't have it deep enough amen so she said Return to your gods but that was Ruth that she held and she cleaved are you a man I'm gonna tell you something if you ain't got it deep enough you might do lack awful and you might go back and serve amen the gods of the world Amen but if you got it deep enough you said uh you know I I'm Not Gonna Let You Go amen because I've seen in you now oh man I got confidence in you I'm talking about Women of Faith I believe that Naomi had exemplified faith I believe that she had testified of a God Amen that was in Israel and she had told them uh Ruth about this one God are you and the rule favor it must have by Revelation and anchored in her it's something about well you we're talking about women of God Women of Faith this morning uh women that would hold out don't matter what Women of Faith so she said uh it's almost like Jacob said I ain't gonna let you go till you bless me I'm gonna wrestle with the angel I'm not gonna let you go to your blessing and she saw something in her mother-in-law amen because and she saw something in her mother-in-law God go ahead don't read and she said where did I go as I would go and where the largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God might see that she didn't say that what God she said what God thy God will be my what my God read on with our Dias will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if art but death part thief in me and when she saw that she was dead fastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her once you've been introduced to the true and living God nothing else going to satisfy you once Jesus said really come in and anchored himself nothing else going to satisfy you she couldn't see that amen I can't stay over here what will happen to her Amen to roof to cause her to have enough faith that I'm gonna leave my kinfo my people and I'm gonna go into a country I've never seen or never visited I'm gonna tell you something brother and sister it takes Faith Amen to want to go to heaven regardless praise God a please set amen praise God you perhaps said I've never seen heaven but I I know that amen that doesn't happen for me The Women of Faith it took women that amen hatched something down inside them that believed that God believed his word amen that was embedded down in her by revelation praise God I believe that Ruth amen represented the Gentile bride and Naomi represented the Jews amen praise God and as Naomi represented Amen to Jews amen and uh Jews represented Gentile bride amen praise God and we know about the kingdom the Redeemer and all of that amen but by the grace God I'm talking about the women right now amen God established inside of rehab the Holland to put her in the genealogy of Jesus Christ and here we're talking about the genealogy amen and Ruth and Boaz and so forth and how amen Jesus Christ come through the lineage amen so by the grace of God these women that uh were sack of feists themselves in their life amen to go with the words praise God it's something about praise God once you by Revelation have seen the word you make a sacrifice I'm going with the word praise God I I know folk might take something wrong with me but I'm going with the word praise God no folks not going to understand that but I'm going with the word praise God there's something about when you got a revelation praise God is the word that I'm looking at them praise God it's it's the god amen amen of the Bible even Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah praise God I believe well amen God had revealed himself to her and it was worth her leaving everything everybody that she loved and was dear to her but I'm leaving them they don't understand why I'm leaving I believe in their thoughts and I'm coming to believe only one God and that's the god of Abraham Isaac and then Jacob I'm I'm trusting him it takes a revelation brother sister that God is God he's the creator of the heavens in the room I'm leaving everything to fall of God give it up all talked about the widow woman this morning amen that she left everything she believed the word here this woman I'm gonna tell you God will reward you you make the right decision and put God first he will reward you and you cannot beat God given praise God you don't know how many blessings you're missing by not believing his word if you would believe his word I'm just not talking to the the women or the sisters this morning but Brothers you included amen but you gotta trust God amen I'm talking to sister this morning but brother still listening it's for you too you can get the crime to fall from the table let me talking to the sisters this morning amen women now of Faith amen so if there's any crime or any leftover you get it to okay so the body great to God now I I said we are we're thinking without the Box God Choice amen and look at the roof as she Journey over there with her mother-in-law not knowing that God was going to use her see God sees your sacrifice God saw the decision that she made amen and Boaz heard about it amen don't you know amen the decision that you make out of a Boaz amen Our God Jesus Christ sees our decisions that we make in our hearts are you up there and when he sees our decision that we make again then I'm gonna trust that one God and I'm gonna go with the word the God got a blessing Hallelujah you know right now I can just see blessings of flowing like a river praise God I I can see God just pouring out the blessings praise God see because I believe that somebody's getting the message I believe that somebody's saying hallelujah praise God I believe there's something to this amen it's something that in this for me praise God I'm gonna get my blessing Women of Faith and I'm saying for a little side topic use me use me I hope every sister in here and every young person young lady young sister would say use me Lord if you use them use me Lord I want to be a sacrifice they made sacrifices I want to sacrifice my life I want to sacrifice in my life use me I gotta move on to the next story in the that's John 4th I don't want to bypass this one and then I'll close hopefully John 4 I know we heard the story but nevertheless the 13th verse John 4. and 13. Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinking of the water that I shall give thee shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into Everlasting he met a certain woman at the well you know I said God makes a decision and chooses I I say he chose somebody that wasn't even in Israel with a woman in another country Gentile chose her he took rehab to Holland and he chose her amen so sometimes God thinks without the Box because some folks don't want to be used some folks are saying hey I'm too obviously I'm you know they got their mind even if God would have came to them and asked them they wouldn't uh uh not me I know no no but these women was able to make the right decision and said use me okay go ahead woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come either to draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither go ahead the woman answered and said I have no husband and Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom down now has is not thy husband and that says Thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I proceeded thou art a prophet our father's worship that woman didn't say stay out of my business leave my business alone what are you doing messing with me you know what I'm saying the Pharisees are up in here and told Jesus you know what you did in the other country come here and do it for us you see what I'm saying but this woman she wasn't picky and going on like you know some folk will say you know she was Meek and humble are you picking on me you know what I'm saying see because what the Jews call invisible Prince of devils isn't that right but this woman here that was in the condition that she was in yet she was in the right place at the right time and God knew where she was he knew all about her all about her past all about what she was going through yet he chose her uh-huh that's what he does who you think I I you know how did this point that one would probably went through a lot of stuff in the church for doing all kind of stuff amen should I met through a whole lot of stuff but she and she couldn't even get water with the rest of the women she had to go there alone by herself sneak and get us some are you with me but here you know sometimes we feel like amen I I I I can't be around the rest of them are you up but God knew that that woman needed something I'm gonna tell you something you know me going through this message I said God knew she needed something and God knew when we need something amen God knew when we need a word from him we needed encourage men we need to know that God understand the seeds what I'm going to understand my problems God God look at me now so the woman here at the well and he's telling her amen I'm gonna give you some water amen that you're never thirst again go ahead on Brett kill our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman believe me that our cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father he worship ye no not what we know what we what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the our cometh and now is when the true worship pressure worship the father in spirit and in true for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth she said he had enough time to go by and deal with that woman needs and speak to her concerning things that he couldn't tell them about are you with me because they would they didn't want to hear him because they call him visible amen they they didn't you know the folks in the synagogue they didn't want him folk in the church they didn't want him he came into his own his own receiving not but this woman this woman was listening to him and she said you know I'm on some of that water you know it's something about folks that got a little time amen praise God other folks amen he's not asking me amen what other men was interested in he was talking about my knee down in my soul died in my spirit of the men they come for all other things but I need something in my soul it meant something that was I'm thirsting for something that my deep call to the deep I need something from God praise God it wasn't just water here that he was concerned that was about spiritual water he knew that's what she needed and I said God knows our needs this morning God knows how what's deep down in our hearts God knows what's going to take us to the storm I'ma say this woman amen she amen said sir I proceeded you a prophet amen and you know I'm gonna tell you something praise God this woman had the right kind of spirit in her even though she had amen looked like she was in bad condition according to the Natural Eye according to the Natural mind but God saw something different I said God saw something different about this woman praise God that sometimes we need to leave folks alone praise God our opinion doesn't matter it's What God Says it's God opinion what he's saying praise God sometime we need to have more grace because sometimes we don't think like that praise God we're thinking hey Noah with God this woman was a woman of faith and proved to be one of God's children that he could use amen this woman had Revival in her spirit and inside of her she was like a fireball she ran through the city and told them to come see a man she had such a fire inside of her she stirred up the whole city and they come running are you up man I'm talking about God oh Lord have mercy she could have passed away and said look at me but she forgot about me what she was but she knew what she wanted to be praise God and she knew that the answer to her Souls cry praise God what she wanted all the time I had come to the police praise God hallelujah I tried to get in other places but Jesus found me I didn't find him he saw me [Applause] praise God she perhaps knew how folk felt about Jesus amen but she said he's the real thing the Messiah they may have found the Messiah praise God hallelujah she had a revelation God was able to tell him I'm he isn't that right and she didn't doubt it amen like the rest of them amen they didn't want him to be the
