[37:15] special needs Lord we do ask you to
[37:18] touch heal in the liver
[37:20] Lord may you set free by the power of
[37:22] the Holy Ghost save such as should be
[37:25] saved those that attain ordained to
[37:28] eternal life God you said they received
[37:31] the word father May there'll be
[37:34] individuals in here those under the
[37:36] sound of my voice that ordained to
[37:38] eternal life that will receive the word
[37:40] Lord and father that they might live
[37:43] eternally with you Lord so father I
[37:46] thank you Lord for the blessings upon
[37:49] your word in Jesus name amen
[37:54] Hebrews 12 and 22
[37:58] it says but you're coming to Mount Zion
[38:02] unto the city of the Living God
[38:05] the Heavenly Jerusalem
[38:08] and to an innumerable company of angels
[38:10] to the general assembly the Church of
[38:13] the firstborn which are written in
[38:15] heaven and God the judge of all and the
[38:18] spirit of just men made perfect and to
[38:21] Jesus the media of the New Covenant and
[38:25] to the blood of spring that speaks
[38:28] better things than that of Abel
[38:31] seeing that even see that ye refuse not
[38:36] him that speaketh for if they escape not
[38:41] who refuse him that speaketh on Earth
[38:45] much more shall not re-escape if we turn
[38:50] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[38:54] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[38:57] he has promised sin yet once more I
[39:02] shake not the Earth only but also the
[39:05] heavens
[39:06] and this word yet once more signify the
[39:11] removal of those things that are shaken
[39:15] and as of the things that are made that
[39:19] those things which cannot be shaken May
[39:23] remain
[39:24] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[39:28] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[39:32] whereby we have
[39:35] we may serve God acceptable as
[39:40] acceptably with relevant and godly fear
[39:43] for our God is a consuming fire may God
[39:47] bless you read this word you may be
[39:48] seated
[39:53] it says that we may
[39:56] wherefore we receive a kingdom that
[39:59] cannot be moved
[40:00] let us have Grace whereby
[40:03] we may serve God acceptable bully
[40:09] with relevance and godly fear
[40:13] and I said
[40:15] I should not be rude
[40:17] the reason why because we have received
[40:22] a kingdom
[40:23] that cannot be moved
[40:27] you know
[40:29] it does not speak of each and every
[40:31] individual in here this morning or those
[40:34] that understanding my voice
[40:37] but those that understand by Revelation
[40:39] and by faith that
[40:41] you have received the kingdom that
[40:44] cannot be moved
[40:46] and having received a kingdom it becomes
[40:49] personal
[40:50] so you said I shall not be moved
[40:56] now
[40:57] for a subtop it I chose to subtopic uh
[41:02] fighting for survival
[41:05] we're fighting to survive
[41:10] you know it's not many that's going to
[41:13] stand
[41:15] at the end
[41:17] the age that we're living in will
[41:20] recombinant Christians are becoming
[41:22] extinct
[41:26] and at the end of the road they're not
[41:28] going to be many standing
[41:33] everybody that goes to church
[41:36] that say that I believe the gospel
[41:40] everybody that say I love Jesus
[41:44] at the end of the road
[41:47] we're fighting demons and Devils that's
[41:49] been let loose out of Euphrates
[41:54] and yet the people fail to understand
[41:58] that we're in a spiritual war
[42:02] and the spirits if it was possible
[42:05] there's deceived even the very lay
[42:10] but because of the unseen Realm
[42:16] folks
[42:18] don't realize the reality
[42:21] the spirit world is just as real as the
[42:24] things that you see
[42:27] that I actually are angels in the
[42:30] invisible Realm
[42:32] fallen angels and the angels of God
[42:37] will be an influence
[42:40] from beneath our form of love
[42:45] they're spirits that speaks to us that
[42:48] try to penetrate in control and press
[42:53] themselves into men flesh
[42:57] those Spirits when they press themselves
[43:00] into you
[43:01] they manifest themselves in diabolic
[43:05] ways uh and godly ways
[43:11] they is the spirit of God that will
[43:14] manifest itself in godliness
[43:19] and now demon spirits that will respond
[43:22] and react causing you to do things
[43:27] usually you look like the spirit that's
[43:29] in you
[43:32] and that's why we see people
[43:35] that do all kind of things to their
[43:37] flesh because they're trying to manifest
[43:39] the power that's in them
[43:42] so when they look in the mirror the
[43:44] spirit says
[43:47] I'm well pleased
[43:49] and they begin to smile because the
[43:51] spirit that's in them began to want to
[43:54] look a certain way
[43:58] the spirit that's any individual wants
[44:01] to act a certain way
[44:04] and nothing you can do
[44:07] to show that person because the spirit
[44:10] has possessed them and it's taken
[44:14] control of them
[44:17] and when the spirit has controlled them
[44:19] and they don't even understand they
[44:22] think that I'm walking in the knob
[44:26] everything is normal
[44:30] but as they began to drift farther and
[44:33] farther
[44:35] into the darkness
[44:37] of this world
[44:40] into the kingdom of darkness
[44:45] there's a kingdom of darkness as a
[44:47] kingdom of light
[44:52] we have received a kingdom that cannot
[44:56] be moved
[44:59] but the kingdom in which
[45:02] men are pressing themselves into
[45:05] is the kingdom of darkness
[45:09] it's like going into a deep pit going
[45:11] into a hole
[45:13] and they won't know until
[45:17] they find out that it's the bottomless
[45:19] pit
[45:22] that it does not have a foundation
[45:26] it cannot survive it cannot stand
[45:32] said about the serpent the serpent does
[45:34] not have backbone he cannot stand
[45:38] that's why on his belly he went once he
[45:41] had a backbone but now he don't have any
[45:43] backbone
[45:45] so the serpent cannot stand on this
[45:47] belly he went
[45:49] are you with me
[45:51] some folks amen when they began to be
[45:55] seduced
[45:57] and controlled by demon power
[46:00] Amen on their bellies shall they go
[46:06] man does not let any longer act like a
[46:10] human
[46:11] a son or daughter of God but he began to
[46:14] manifest
[46:16] the serpent seed
[46:21] and he began to produce
[46:24] the serpent
[46:26] and all his utility
[46:30] and what is happening with man
[46:34] they don't know
[46:36] the satility of the serpent
[46:39] how subtle the serpent is
[46:45] we have received a kingdom that cannot
[46:49] be moved
[46:51] we are fighting for survival
[46:57] you asked me will the world survive the
[47:01] earthquakes the storms the Hurricanes
[47:05] where the Earth survive
[47:10] the floods and
[47:13] all the trauma that has gone on in the
[47:16] earth will the world survive it
[47:21] the bombs that have been dropped in the
[47:24] shells at the people are shelling one
[47:27] another killing one another murdering
[47:29] one another shoot now one another will
[47:31] the young people survive
[47:36] what is going on will we survive
[47:40] will we be able to make it through
[47:45] this growth stock since that has covered
[47:48] the Earth will you survive
[47:51] you cannot tell me you're not being
[47:54] affected by
[47:55] the darkness of this world and things
[47:58] are not happening in your home and in
[48:01] your life and in your surrounding that
[48:04] you're not being
[48:07] touch
[48:11] you must know that these things these
[48:13] powers that are penetrating
[48:20] you asked me
[48:22] will the church survive
[48:27] and I'll tell you
[48:30] there won't be many survivors
[48:34] there won't be many that would say that
[48:38] I made it
[48:42] you asked me about a church that came
[48:44] out with two million out of Egypt
[48:47] how many survived the wilderness
[48:51] and I'll tell you there was only two
[48:53] standing when it was all over
[48:57] I'm gonna get ahead of my story but you
[49:00] asked me about the days of Noah
[49:04] and how many survived and I'll tell you
[49:07] that it was only eight
[49:11] you asked me about the Deeds of Sodom
[49:14] and tomorrow and the things that
[49:16] happened in the cities around about how
[49:19] many survive
[49:22] that was full but one looked back and
[49:25] turned to a pill of salt
[49:28] how many will survive in this day
[49:34] the Bible tells us as it was in the
[49:36] Deeds of Noah
[49:37] and as it was in the days of Sodom thus
[49:41] shall it be when the day when the son of
[49:43] man is revealed
[49:46] I wonder will you be a survivor
[49:50] who shall be able to stand
[49:53] the single song My Lord getting us ready
[49:56] for that great day
[49:59] and tell me who shall be able to stand
[50:03] will you be standing
[50:07] will you be able to stand
[50:12] I find out that
[50:14] the Bible says before he's coming that
[50:17] there would be a great fall in the way
[50:20] first
[50:22] and that the man of sin shall be
[50:24] revealed
[50:27] and I wonder if
[50:29] when we speak of the church surviving
[50:35] the church looks like it's growing in
[50:38] many places
[50:41] but in many times the church has been
[50:44] blind and deceived
[50:47] because the devil has come in the church
[50:51] and I thought one day I would preach
[50:55] worshiping Satan in the church
[51:00] worshiping the devil in the church
[51:05] people don't know what they worship
[51:08] now let me
[51:10] as I was on my knees praying this
[51:13] morning
[51:14] and I began to go in a route that I
[51:18] just trying to make it clear to you
[51:21] because so many people are confident in
[51:24] their walk with God and they're so
[51:27] confident and they're so sure that they
[51:30] have
[51:32] the right Jesus
[51:35] not knowing that there's other Jesus
[51:39] I hear
[51:42] some people are confident that they know
[51:46] the god of the Bible but
[51:50] I want to know how many survived in the
[51:53] Old Testament Saints when Jesus came and
[51:56] how many was there on the upper room it
[51:58] was only 120.
[52:02] doesn't matter how what how many
[52:03] miracles they saw and how much they said
[52:06] they believed and it was only 120 that
[52:09] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:14] so you can tell me that you have the
[52:17] correct Spirit you have the the correct
[52:21] Revelation you can tell me many things
[52:25] you can tell me that I I genuinely know
[52:28] where I stand I know I don't believe
[52:31] that there was one of them amen that was
[52:34] uh in the world and Jesus did that
[52:37] didn't weren't confident that they knew
[52:40] God but they couldn't see a
[52:41] dispensational change
[52:44] they couldn't see a dispensational
[52:46] change they could not recognize their
[52:49] day in this message
[52:52] they didn't know they they thought they
[52:55] had it all together but it was a change
[52:57] of dispensations Amen it was changing
[53:01] from law to Grace but they failed to
[53:03] recognize that the kingdom of God was
[53:06] being preached
[53:08] but they instead of coming into the
[53:11] kingdom they were holding on to the law
[53:15] and I believe that
[53:18] Through The Eyes of our
[53:21] our religious spirit
[53:25] we think that we have come to a place
[53:27] religiously that I really have Jesus
[53:32] I really know him
[53:36] so is the rest of the world
[53:39] we're coming until a time where
[53:43] everybody is saved and everybody's all
[53:46] right that's all right if that's what
[53:49] you want to believe
[53:52] everybody's going to heaven
[53:55] if that's what you want to believe
[53:59] there's not many that want to take a
[54:02] solid stand and understand
[54:05] what truth is all about
[54:09] Jesus said I am the way
[54:11] the truth in the life
[54:14] and no man can come to the father
[54:17] except he come by me
[54:21] let me just
[54:23] take you somewhere that
[54:29] I went this morning
[54:32] and then maybe a little difficult
[54:36] Galatians 1.
[54:39] you cannot tell me that God's chosen
[54:42] people that really had the bible really
[54:45] thought that they knew scripture
[54:48] and perhaps know the Bible better than
[54:51] you think you know it
[54:53] I'm not getting on you this morning but
[54:55] I just want you to think about it and I
[54:57] want you to uh just think about what the
[55:00] word is saying to you
[55:04] now you said if anybody should have
[55:07] known God it should have been the Jews
[55:11] after all that God had
[55:14] been with them for all that time and it
[55:16] was special and they were chosen and
[55:19] they were God's chosen people and I
[55:21] believe that's the way the church World
[55:23] believed today
[55:26] they're so confident that because they
[55:29] are the church
[55:32] and because they are supposedly to be a
[55:35] Christian
[55:36] Paul message was not a popular message
[55:38] he said he's not a Jew
[55:41] there's one I believe
[55:43] neither is the circumcision is that
[55:46] which is outly
[55:49] he's a Jew that was one inwardly in the
[55:52] circumcision is that of the heart and of
[55:54] the spirit
[55:56] so don't you rest in your fleshly amid
[56:01] recognition amen but to recognize that
[56:04] there has been a change
[56:10] and I believe that the church World
[56:12] failed to recognize that there is a
[56:15] change
[56:18] yes people say they preach the gospel
[56:21] yes they say they preach Jesus yes they
[56:25] say that but are they really preaching
[56:27] Jesus
[56:30] which Jesus are they preaching
[56:33] which gospel are they preaching
[56:36] yet they say I believe in a prophet I
[56:39] believe the message yet they say I
[56:42] believe I'm a this or that
[56:45] but what Jesus are they preaching
[56:50] we're so confident that we have arrived
[56:54] that we got something that nobody else
[56:56] has I all believe that
[57:01] no matter what persuasion they are they
[57:04] all believe the same thing that they got
[57:06] some and they are happiness shot in
[57:10] their prison God because they got
[57:12] something special
[57:17] feeling to recognize
[57:21] the god of the Bible
[57:24] the Jesus of scripture
[57:27] are you with me
[57:29] the Jesus that they have is
[57:33] they don't look like the Jesus that I
[57:36] see in Bible
[57:40] it don't look like the gospel that I see
[57:42] in the Bible
[57:47] it's strange to me but maybe you see
[57:51] that they believe in the same Jesus that
[57:53] you believe in yeah that's right they
[57:56] believe in the same Jesus you believe in
[58:00] but not to Jesus the Bible speaks of
[58:04] oh they believe the same now sister I
[58:07] believe but not the one
[58:10] that Paul preached
[58:14] not the one that Paul preached
[58:18] are you with me
[58:20] I wonder is it the one that Paul
[58:23] preached
[58:24] of one that they says that the prophet
[58:27] preached in this age
[58:29] is that the same one that it sounds a
[58:32] little different to me
[58:34] but you are succumbed by a spirit that
[58:39] everybody that believes that God sent a
[58:42] prophet is preaching Paul's gospel the
[58:45] gospel that Paul preached that Jesus
[58:48] that Paul preached
[58:52] I'm persuaded that
[58:54] I
[58:56] let me see let me examine and see
[59:00] whether or not everybody that says
[59:03] Lord Lord
[59:06] do they really believe the Lord is the
[59:10] Lord of their life
[59:12] because many shall see in that day Lord
[59:16] then I cast out Devils did not do this
[59:19] and that in your name but he's going to
[59:21] say depart from me
[59:26] you might say within your spirit who Do
[59:28] You Think You Are
[59:32] who do you think you are brother Simmons
[59:35] who do you think you are Pastor Simon
[59:37] who do you think you are Bishop Simmons
[59:39] or whatever you want to call me
[59:41] you know what I'm saying but who do you
[59:44] think you are it's not about me
[59:46] it's not about you
[59:49] it's the gospel it's the word that I'm
[59:52] concerned about
[59:55] the titles and the names or or who you
[59:59] say you believe or what you say you
[1:00:01] believe is the word
[1:00:04] are you with me
[1:00:07] I didn't come to introduce you to me or
[1:00:11] some man or some gospel that I you know
[1:00:14] I it's the Bible
[1:00:16] it's the Jesus of the Bible
[1:00:20] but do you know who the father is do you
[1:00:24] know who God is
[1:00:26] it's another thing to say you know and
[1:00:29] to think that you know
[1:00:32] God gotta do something inside your
[1:00:34] spiritual world
[1:00:37] he's got to shake your very spiritual
[1:00:39] world
[1:00:40] and let you know that you don't know as
[1:00:43] you ought to know you think that you
[1:00:46] know God but you don't know God
[1:00:52] is the god of what you perceive by your
[1:00:57] spirit
[1:01:00] you said oh you're talking to somebody
[1:01:02] I'm not talking to you don't receive
[1:01:04] that
[1:01:05] but if I'm talking to somebody let me
[1:01:07] talk to that somebody
[1:01:11] I'm not here to be analyzed
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:16] I'm talking to you about this Bible
[1:01:20] this Bible that we say we believe I want
[1:01:23] you to believe that
[1:01:26] believe what God Said in his Bible
[1:01:29] not all the hooping and hollering and
[1:01:31] getting all the emotion and all excited
[1:01:33] by something
[1:01:36] that don't mean that you know him
[1:01:39] I don't care how large your child and
[1:01:41] how much you dance that don't mean you
[1:01:43] know him
[1:01:46] whether or not you have the life
[1:01:50] the same life that was in Jesus Christ
[1:01:52] that life in you
[1:01:55] is that Jesus in you
[1:01:58] okay let me see what Paul preached
[1:02:00] because
[1:02:02] he wasn't talking to somebody that
[1:02:04] wasn't saved or or wasn't uh Holy Ghost
[1:02:08] Field or whatever he was talking to
[1:02:10] people that's supposed to hide it the
[1:02:12] Holy Ghost people that's supposed to be
[1:02:14] saved and if you could talk to them like
[1:02:16] that then how come we can't talk like
[1:02:19] you talk
[1:02:21] and we preach the same gospel
[1:02:25] okay
[1:02:27] and that's what happens
[1:02:30] he said in the sixth verse
[1:02:32] he said I Marvel that you know what
[1:02:37] so soon remove
[1:02:39] he said I shall not be removed
[1:02:44] I'm Marvin at you so soon removed
[1:02:48] the Bible said certain men crept in
[1:02:50] unaware
[1:02:54] you allow spirits to creep in unaware
[1:03:00] men to come in unaware
[1:03:04] they're not worried about you
[1:03:07] they're worried about how much money and
[1:03:09] how much time you can pay how much money
[1:03:11] you can give they ain't worried about
[1:03:12] your soul
[1:03:14] look at them they go right after the
[1:03:16] money
[1:03:18] they're concerned about what you can
[1:03:20] give them and what you can do for them
[1:03:22] how many more people they can add to the
[1:03:24] church they're not worrying about your
[1:03:26] soul
[1:03:30] so they won't tell you the truth they'll
[1:03:32] Pat you on the back and tell you as well
[1:03:34] when they know you're on your way to
[1:03:36] hell
[1:03:38] they'll patch on the mat back and make
[1:03:41] you feel good make you feel like what
[1:03:44] you believe and what you were doing is
[1:03:46] all right even though it's contrary to
[1:03:48] the word
[1:03:52] and that favorite saying of those
[1:03:55] unbelieving devils
[1:03:58] ain't nobody perfect
[1:04:01] there ain't nobody got it all
[1:04:06] the excuse
[1:04:08] that we make when God show us his word
[1:04:13] yet we don't want to believe it we want
[1:04:16] to make excuse because we cannot fulfill
[1:04:20] the word god interprets his word by
[1:04:22] fulfilling it
[1:04:24] by manifesting it
[1:04:27] and when God's word begin to be made
[1:04:29] manifested we say I don't see it
[1:04:34] in other words you said I don't want to
[1:04:36] do it
[1:04:38] I don't want to do it and no excuse said
[1:04:41] I don't want to do it is I don't see it
[1:04:44] yeah you see it
[1:04:46] you see it but you don't want to do it
[1:04:49] and because you don't want to do it you
[1:04:52] don't believe it
[1:04:54] I see something different yeah you see
[1:04:56] something different
[1:04:59] he said I Marvel that you'll so soon
[1:05:01] removed
[1:05:03] from him that call you
[1:05:06] unto the grace of Christ until what
[1:05:10] y'all say it's not another and if I want
[1:05:12] Jesus we all serve the same law another
[1:05:14] gospel
[1:05:16] if it was one then how about now
[1:05:20] look like it was about a thousand
[1:05:22] different ones
[1:05:23] maybe a couple thousand
[1:05:26] are you up there
[1:05:28] it don't seem to be the same gospel
[1:05:31] okay which is not another
[1:05:34] but there'll be what
[1:05:36] y'all can't say it again but that'd be
[1:05:39] what
[1:05:43] some that trouble you
[1:05:46] y'all better stop patting folks on the
[1:05:48] back telling them they all right
[1:05:53] oh I know she made it I know he made it
[1:05:55] I know you you don't know yeah you know
[1:05:58] just like you making it
[1:06:02] you want to call that love
[1:06:05] call that clothes in your eyes
[1:06:08] I want to call it love
[1:06:12] I'm gonna tell you something you better
[1:06:14] stop loving what God don't
[1:06:18] he said if you love me you're what
[1:06:20] keep my commandment isn't that right
[1:06:23] you better stop talking my uh yeah you
[1:06:27] may love the person but
[1:06:29] if it's another gospel it's another
[1:06:31] Jesus don't don't just say they believe
[1:06:34] the same Jesus no they didn't
[1:06:37] they didn't believe the same Jesus I
[1:06:39] believe in
[1:06:40] they didn't believe the same gospel that
[1:06:43] I'm talking about
[1:06:47] amen other than that everybody just be
[1:06:49] going just do anything and and say you
[1:06:52] love Jesus and preach oh come on
[1:06:56] which is not another
[1:06:58] but there'll be something to trouble you
[1:07:00] and would what
[1:07:03] preserve perverted somebody is reverting
[1:07:06] the gospel
[1:07:09] but though what
[1:07:11] we are what
[1:07:14] come on I don't I don't I don't say an
[1:07:17] angel from heaven didn't speak to them
[1:07:18] and didn't tell them amen
[1:07:21] just like the women that preach I don't
[1:07:23] say an angel didn't come from Heaven
[1:07:25] told them that the preach Angel could
[1:07:28] have come from heaven and told them
[1:07:31] but he said though we are an angel come
[1:07:34] from Heaven does what
[1:07:37] preach any other
[1:07:39] are you with me
[1:07:41] I don't care who it is
[1:07:43] what does brother Simmons a brother
[1:07:46] whoever
[1:07:48] You Gotta Be You Gotta stick to this
[1:07:51] word
[1:07:54] because I said it you said well I I got
[1:07:56] confidence in him
[1:07:58] your confidence should be in this word
[1:08:03] are you up man
[1:08:05] well I know it right because brother
[1:08:07] Simmons said because there's a minute to
[1:08:09] say or because of my pastor say ah it's
[1:08:13] what the Bible says
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:18] well I thank the Lord
[1:08:22] just because
[1:08:24] a spiritual man said it don't mean that
[1:08:27] the spiritual man sometimes can make a
[1:08:30] mistake
[1:08:32] it wasn't be a prophet was it being a
[1:08:36] angel that come from Heaven you can't
[1:08:38] you got to stay with what
[1:08:40] what's written
[1:08:43] are you up now
[1:08:45] this is a hard saying but people are
[1:08:48] just so caught up that ah I know it
[1:08:51] right because what
[1:08:53] laughs
[1:08:56] the prophet that God said I preach what
[1:08:58] Paul preached
[1:09:00] isn't that right
[1:09:02] and uh we're responsible for preaching
[1:09:05] what he preached and so we preach what
[1:09:07] Paul preached
[1:09:09] are you up man
[1:09:11] are you a man
[1:09:13] if he said I preach what Paul preached
[1:09:15] and we're responsible for preaching what
[1:09:17] Paul preached
[1:09:22] tell me you're not responsible for
[1:09:24] preaching what Paul preached well Paul
[1:09:26] didn't know this Paul didn't know that
[1:09:28] okay
[1:09:30] okay you know
[1:09:33] all these big explosive men that you got
[1:09:38] to hear and you can't hear what the
[1:09:40] Bible's saying

[1:09:44] word
[1:09:47] are you with me
[1:09:49] praise God
[1:09:51] the reason why I believe what the
[1:09:53] prophet said because I see that he's
[1:09:55] preaching what Paul preached
[1:09:58] that's why I believe it
[1:10:00] you wonder why why are you believing
[1:10:01] because he preaching what Paul preach
[1:10:04] and I believe what Paul preached
[1:10:07] are you with me amen
[1:10:08] amen you said well I ain't got no ain't
[1:10:10] got no trouble with what Paul priest
[1:10:13] are you with me
[1:10:18] he said though we an angel come from
[1:10:20] Heaven preach any other gospel then that
[1:10:22] which we preached let him be a woman
[1:10:26] why you fussing at me I ain't fussing at
[1:10:28] you
[1:10:30] I'm mad at the Devil
[1:10:32] are you up man
[1:10:34] what you fussing about today
[1:10:36] I'm mad at the Devil y'all ought to be
[1:10:39] mad at the governor too
[1:10:41] that goes about to deceive folk and try
[1:10:44] to
[1:10:45] um take people mind away from the word
[1:10:48] of God you ought to be upset with the
[1:10:51] Devil
[1:10:52] no no no no no so I'm trying to you know
[1:10:55] let you see that there has been an
[1:10:58] invasion of demon power to come to try
[1:11:02] amen to destroy the Church of the Living
[1:11:05] God
[1:11:07] are you a man
[1:11:09] but you didn't come to you know you you
[1:11:13] you come to Mount Zion
[1:11:16] amen you come to the Church of the
[1:11:19] firstborn written in heaven
[1:11:23] are you with me
[1:11:25] you come to a kingdom that cannot be
[1:11:29] moved
[1:11:30] that will not refuse this to be moved
[1:11:36] Hallelujah
[1:11:38] let me show let me try to close quickly
[1:11:42] but before I do that second Corinthians
[1:11:45] 11.
[1:11:48] it's so many places I would like to go
[1:11:51] but I I don't have time
[1:11:53] but I want you to I want to come into
[1:11:57] some clothes you hear because
[1:12:01] you allow yourself
[1:12:04] just because you said in church just
[1:12:06] because you say you're going to have to
[1:12:08] seek God to the Holy Ghost begin to
[1:12:10] reveal the word to you
[1:12:13] you're gonna have to get on your knees
[1:12:15] and you say God
[1:12:16] open the scriptures to me not just a lot
[1:12:19] you open the scriptures to the prophet
[1:12:22] Lord you're on the scriptures as a
[1:12:23] pastor but I need you to open the word
[1:12:25] to me
[1:12:29] I believe it because my paths are
[1:12:31] blessed I believe because the prophet no
[1:12:33] you've got to know it because God has
[1:12:35] revealed it to you
[1:12:39] your Revelation is personal
[1:12:42] your Revelation causes you not to bow
[1:12:46] that you stand for the word
[1:12:49] you'll stand up for Jesus because you
[1:12:53] know who he is
[1:12:55] come on somebody
[1:12:57] said in the beginning was the word
[1:12:59] and the Word was with God and the word
[1:13:04] we're talking about the word of God
[1:13:07] we're talking about God's word that's
[1:13:10] what I'm talking about
[1:13:12] I'm talking about the word of God
[1:13:18] you'll stand for the word of God
[1:13:21] are you with me
[1:13:23] somebody said well
[1:13:24] I'm standing on the word
[1:13:27] is it the word is this the Bible
[1:13:30] are you with me
[1:13:32] you got to stand on the Bible That's the
[1:13:35] word of God
[1:13:37] praise God anything else might fail you
[1:13:41] are you with me
[1:13:43] anything else might fear you
[1:13:46] it will fail you
[1:13:50] are you with me
[1:13:52] the only thing that will not fail you is
[1:13:54] the word
[1:13:56] in the beginning what the word the word
[1:13:58] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:14:00] Word was what
[1:14:02] made flesh
[1:14:04] are you with me
[1:14:06] the word was made flash into all the
[1:14:09] models so the Jesus that I'm preaching
[1:14:12] and the Jesus that Paul preached he was
[1:14:15] the word
[1:14:17] and he's the word now he was the word
[1:14:20] dead and he'll be the word tomorrow
[1:14:24] he's the one
[1:14:26] all the investor was the name written
[1:14:30] Lord of lords king of King the word of
[1:14:33] God
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] he's the word of God
[1:14:37] when it's all over it's going to be the
[1:14:39] word of God
[1:14:41] not man world is going to be the word of
[1:14:44] God
[1:14:45] as you're going to be judged by anything
[1:14:47] you're going to be judged by what's
[1:14:49] written in the book
[1:14:51] are you
[1:14:53] it ain't gonna be what Brother Sam was
[1:14:55] saying what somebody man said it's going
[1:14:57] to be the word of God
[1:15:00] are you up there
[1:15:01] so don't get upset with me because I
[1:15:04] believe the Bible
[1:15:07] are you a man
[1:15:09] supposed to get mad at you
[1:15:12] they get upset
[1:15:14] because they got more confidence
[1:15:19] in
[1:15:21] what somebody else said
[1:15:24] then they got confidence in what the
[1:15:25] Bible said
[1:15:27] oh you look man
[1:15:29] we got more confidence
[1:15:32] and how they believed and what the word
[1:15:35] said
[1:15:36] the word is the word of God Is Right
[1:15:41] okay
[1:15:43] so
[1:15:45] a second Corinthians
[1:15:47] 11 and 4 it says
[1:15:50] for if we pre if he
[1:15:53] that Comet preached what
[1:15:57] whom we have not what
[1:15:59] uh if you receive a what
[1:16:04] which we have not what
[1:16:06] uh another what
[1:16:09] which ye have not what
[1:16:13] you might as well bear with him amen
[1:16:17] now you tell me how can you
[1:16:20] equate uh how can you separate
[1:16:24] the Jesus of the Bible from the word of
[1:16:26] God
[1:16:28] the gospel amen should be Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] and he's the word
[1:16:34] are you with me
[1:16:36] why come people amen think they got
[1:16:38] Jesus and they amen and they don't bleed
[1:16:41] the word
[1:16:44] oh God Jesus I know he died for my sin I
[1:16:47] know but I don't believe what he said in
[1:16:49] the word
[1:16:52] are you a man what's Jesus is it the
[1:16:57] Jesus of the Bible it is the Jesus that
[1:16:59] you've conquered up in your mind and you
[1:17:02] receive another Spirit or is it the
[1:17:04] Jesus of the Bible
[1:17:08] tell you something
[1:17:10] things might have happened to your life
[1:17:11] things might have happened in in your
[1:17:14] walk things about to happen in the
[1:17:16] church let things might have happened to
[1:17:18] your preacher things might have happened
[1:17:20] all kind of ways but I want you to know
[1:17:22] one thing
[1:17:24] when it all bows down amen I want to
[1:17:28] know who's going to be able to stand
[1:17:31] who what what he said you did run well
[1:17:35] who didn't hinder you
[1:17:37] amen what do you did you run away when
[1:17:40] you're when you hurt in the water what
[1:17:42] made you run
[1:17:45] the Bible says right division make it
[1:17:48] plain he didn't read it
[1:17:50] that you may be able to run
[1:17:53] are you with me but a vision is for a
[1:17:57] point in time
[1:17:58] I believe this is the time to run
[1:18:01] if you're ever going to run this is the
[1:18:04] time you ought to be willing to run
[1:18:07] I believe that
[1:18:10] it's another gospel it's another Jesus
[1:18:14] because when you look in the word and
[1:18:16] you see what the word is saying about it
[1:18:18] and you look at what the church is
[1:18:19] saying about it or what some preacher's
[1:18:21] saying about it I say Amen it's just not
[1:18:24] because hey I I believe that God sent a
[1:18:28] word in our days to reveal a word of God
[1:18:30] but it hasn't been revealed
[1:18:35] but is it revealed to you
[1:18:38] no we're good God said a reveal word he
[1:18:41] said the word in the power of those days
[1:18:43] but it wasn't revealed to those Jews he
[1:18:46] said it to them he came into his own his
[1:18:48] own receiver this is in whom is the arm
[1:18:51] of the Lord
[1:18:53] Who Shall Believe
[1:18:55] I report isn't that right
[1:18:58] but who God has to reveal itself to you
[1:19:01] as an individual
[1:19:04] are you with me but you're interested
[1:19:07] what are we gonna reveal whether I have
[1:19:09] all I can do say what he say come on
[1:19:11] brother sister you gotta see this word
[1:19:13] be revealed to you
[1:19:16] just by revelation
[1:19:19] upon us right now build my church in the
[1:19:22] what
[1:19:23] the Gates of Hell shall not what
[1:19:25] Prevail amen by Revelation the rock of
[1:19:29] Revelation got to be revealed to you as
[1:19:31] an individual it can't be a collected
[1:19:34] thing
[1:19:36] it's an individual
[1:19:38] God revealing himself to you that he
[1:19:41] died for your sin
[1:19:42] he's shouting this Precious Blood for
[1:19:44] you
[1:19:45] until you believe Jesus did it for you
[1:19:49] amen and he has a kingdom that you can
[1:19:52] come into
[1:19:53] and he wants to deliver you from the
[1:19:55] power of Darkness and he wants to
[1:19:58] translate into his kingdom
[1:20:01] hey God do it for me
[1:20:04] oh God miss somebody see the other
[1:20:07] Kingdom in invisible Kingdom that God
[1:20:09] wants it to be visible to you
[1:20:13] God wants to show you his kingdom
[1:20:16] God wants to reveal his kingdom to you
[1:20:19] God wants you to see his glory
[1:20:22] amen God wants you to see his power
[1:20:26] Hallelujah
[1:20:29] yes it's an individual Journey brother
[1:20:31] sister
[1:20:32] going to church hooping and hiding but
[1:20:36] God hadn't spoke and revealed himself to
[1:20:38] them
[1:20:41] another just sitting around and don't
[1:20:43] know why I'm here while I exists
[1:20:46] and they'll continue to do that they may
[1:20:48] get 60 70 years old and they just
[1:20:52] around
[1:20:54] become religious
[1:20:56] never have revelation
[1:20:58] never walk in the power of God never
[1:21:01] amen receive the blessings that have
[1:21:04] been given to them by inheritance
[1:21:07] through the blood of Jesus Christ never
[1:21:10] taking full advantage of the glory that
[1:21:13] has been revealed because it hadn't been
[1:21:15] revealed to them as individuals
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] this Bible amen when Paul began to open
[1:21:23] it up the Old Testament amen it was
[1:21:25] minutes that was a trouble and some was
[1:21:28] moved amen but there was others that
[1:21:31] said amen I'm gonna take a firing stand
[1:21:34] even Peter said Paul spoke things hard
[1:21:37] to be understood but you know one thing
[1:21:39] I'm gonna do I ain't gonna wrestle
[1:21:41] against him and I'm telling you don't
[1:21:43] wrest against those things that Paul
[1:21:44] said
[1:21:45] to your own destruction
[1:21:47] amen Paul said Peter said I'm backing up
[1:21:51] Paul I might have the keys but Paul got
[1:21:54] Revelation that amen looked like a lord
[1:21:57] hi for me but one thing's about it I
[1:22:01] know God is speaking and God is
[1:22:03] revealing
[1:22:04] amen the Holy Ghost is bad witness with
[1:22:07] what Paul preached amen
[1:22:09] praise God and the Holy Ghost if you
[1:22:11] receive the right Spirit you'll receive
[1:22:13] the Holy Ghost it's going to be our
[1:22:14] witness to what the Bible says
[1:22:18] my last scripture was in uh uh Matthew
[1:22:22] 24 and I'm and that's it Matthew 24 35.
[1:22:29] it says here he says Heaven and Earth
[1:22:33] shall what pass away but my what
[1:22:37] my words shall never pass away
[1:22:40] oh you would be
[1:22:41] I shall not be moved
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] it's the word of God
[1:22:48] are you with me
[1:22:49] if you're not going to pass away he said
[1:22:51] you abide in me what
[1:22:53] my word abide in you then you can walk
[1:22:57] acts what you will and not doing
[1:22:59] praise God I'm telling you it's not
[1:23:01] about coming to church and not about
[1:23:03] locking brother Simmons and not a lot of
[1:23:05] blocking Brian Tabernacle it's about
[1:23:07] Jesus Christ
[1:23:09] amen do I'm talking about the Jesus of
[1:23:11] the Bible here's the word
[1:23:13] and when you find people preaching
[1:23:15] another gospel preaching that is all
[1:23:17] right for this and all right for that
[1:23:19] and telling you everything gonna be all
[1:23:21] right all you got to do just believe in
[1:23:23] Jesus but the Jesus that they believe in

[1:24:55] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:24:57] amen and they're the full living
[1:24:59] creatures God in the book of Acts and if

[1:26:17] preaching what Paul preached
[1:26:19] amen folks don't like you
[1:26:22] because you preach what Paul Frees Pope
[1:26:25] to turn away from you because you preach
[1:26:27] what Paul preached
[1:26:29] praise God
[1:26:31] you preach the Bible
[1:26:33] praise God there's not many Gonna Stand
[1:26:36] there's not many some
[1:26:39] if God don't reveal itself to you
[1:26:41] that he is the word
[1:26:43] you'll never see
[1:26:45] all you see is he's Jesus he's my savior
[1:26:48] but he's not my law
[1:26:50] that's what they see so the Lord rules
[1:26:54] amen you bought with the price in you
[1:26:57] not your own you can't do what you want
[1:27:00] in that praise God you've been involved
[1:27:02] with the price
[1:27:03] the church that he's purchased with his
[1:27:05] wife
[1:27:06] own blood
[1:27:08] it was his blood not yours but it was
[1:27:11] his blood

[1:27:39] blood test was proven
[1:27:41] and the blood were proven amen and
[1:27:44] that's why he wrote your name on the
[1:27:46] land book of life before what
[1:27:49] the foundation of the world it sounds
[1:27:51] good to a Believer it sounds good to
[1:27:54] somebody that it means something to do
[1:27:56] but others It Don't Mean a Thing to them
[1:28:01] Jesus died don't mean a thing to them
[1:28:06] Jesus blood don't need a thing to them
[1:28:09] why because they don't believe it
[1:28:13] and they don't want to receive it so no
[1:28:15] matter how much and how loud you holler
[1:28:17] and how much you tell them Jesus loves
[1:28:19] you they don't believe it
[1:28:22] they want nothing to
[1:28:25] they'll come to church
[1:28:27] they'll be faithful paying their tithes
[1:28:29] and their offering and they'll never be
[1:28:31] able to live nothing
[1:28:34] that's why they all twisted up tied up
[1:28:36] tangled up doing all kind of crazy stuff
[1:28:39] and talking about they believers
[1:28:44] see what the word said it won't can't
[1:28:46] manifest it why because they all messed
[1:28:50] up
[1:28:51] takes full of repentance
[1:28:54] pick somebody to Humble themselves and
[1:28:56] say Lord I want to
