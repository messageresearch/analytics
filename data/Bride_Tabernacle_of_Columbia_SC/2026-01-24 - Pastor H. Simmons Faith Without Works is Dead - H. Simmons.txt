Lord, be merciful to him, Lord. and we're not oh Lord and different ones Lord praying oh GOD FOR DENISE LORD ALL THOSE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS LORD FATHER HELP THEM now in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. The question is why? Why won't we serve? And the prophet spoke a sermon. Why? I don't know what's wrong. The book of James, the 2 chapter, the 14th verse. We thank God again for his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May his word have preeminence tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "What does it profited my brethren? Though a man say he has faith and have not works. The question is can faith what? &gt;&gt; Save him. &gt;&gt; Can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warm and filled. Notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body, what does it profit? Even so faith if it has not what &gt;&gt; it is what &gt;&gt; being alone. Yay. A man may say that thou has what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; And have not what? &gt;&gt; Words. &gt;&gt; Show me thy faith without what? &gt;&gt; And I will show thee my faith by what? &gt;&gt; By works. &gt;&gt; Thou believeth that there is one God. Thou doeth well. The demons are the devils believe also. And what? Tremor, &gt;&gt; tremor. But will thou know, oh vain man, that faith without &gt;&gt; faith without what? &gt;&gt; Works is dead. &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. May be seated. God bless the word. Faith without works is what? &gt;&gt; Dead. &gt;&gt; Dead. Amen. Praise God. Do you want a dead faith? You know, sometimes we we simply just says, "I'm a believer." But there's no action. Faith has action. Faith produces works. So, uh, we'll go to Romans 3. Here he says in 28, therefore we conclude that a man is justified by what? &gt;&gt; Faith without the deeds of the what? &gt;&gt; Law. Without the deeds of the law. It says, "Is he that is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, the Gentiles also. Seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid. We establish the law. So here we have James speaking and we have Paul speaking. Paul speaking. He says a man is justified by faith without the what? The deeds of the law. Without the deeds of the law. And James says faith without works is dead. So by the grace of God, we want to look at it from the perspective that as we going on back to James, we want to look on faith without works is dead. A lot of times people when they get saved, they just sit back and relax. They get saved, said, "I gave Jesus my life, my heart, and they just sat back and relax, and they want to ride on into heaven. Let's just go to heaven. You know, I'm justified by faith. I got peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. I can go into heaven." But we had those that Excuse me. I I better stay in Galatian. Galatian uh for a moment. Galatians 5. There was a question with those Jews and Paul was dealing with the Jews that have come out of Jud Judaism under the law and come into grace. And he was dealing with those folks and to deal with them because a lot of those people were leaning back to put upon the Gentiles. They wanted them to be circumcised because the Jews had to be circumcised and they had the law of Moses. And having the law of Moses, they wanted the the Gentiles to come under the law. And the Gentiles had come to God through faith. And they had to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and the redemption that was through the cross. That's why Paul says, "I come knowing not nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified." And he was saying that uh he was preaching that Christ was crucified for us. Then he was talking about receive you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith. So it was faith. He put a lot of emphasis on faith where the Jews in turn had put a lot emphasis on the law. The law of Moses. Amen. And so James was talking about the faith were not works. So he was talking about not the works of the law, but he was talking about the works that followed of faith of the gospel. So we're looking at the law of Moses and we're looking at the gospel. We're looking at the law of faith. Amen. That it produces if we really believe God, it will produce works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here are people who say, "Well, I believe THE GOSPEL. THAT'S IT. Simply we find that uh that the Lutheran and the Reformation they believe because they had come out of Catholicism and they had justification. The just shall live by faith and they thought that that was it. So there was no further. They didn't go on to sanctification and they didn't go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They just stop with the just believing and accepting Jesus Christ. I think a lot of people in their journey they use the gospel for law. They use the gospel of Jesus Christ and a a lot of people feel like they've been in bondage. So he says here, "Stand fast in the liberty where Christ has be made you free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage." So he was talking about the yolks of bondage. So what yoke of bondage? He says, "Behold uh Paul, I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you what? &gt;&gt; Nothing." &gt;&gt; Nothing. So in other words, h the the people believe that we're serving God and we going to be justified by the law. And if we do what and a lot of people come to church, you can't do this, you can't do that. And if you do this, you you're not uh saved, you're not a message believer, you're not a Christian. And and and they look at you like that. And a lot of people look at the dos and don'ts, the dos and don'ts of right sometimes even in the gospel. But it must be something that uh is activated in you. Not because the church what the church stand for, what the message stand for. It's something that what the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; see if I I I said if you ever get if the people ever get the love of God in their heart, you won't have to worry about telling them how to dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Hey, you know that dress too short. That dress too tall. that dress got to split up too high. That's just you got to tell them all that kind of stuff. Hey, what you doing? You know what I'm saying? You got to all that correction. But if they get the love of God, the spirit will lead them. &gt;&gt; It will bring conviction and condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not the law that we talking about under the gospel is a law of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you love God. that you've come into a personal relationship where you can be led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here, Amen. It it it becomes a law. Amen. If you leave this church, you're going to hell. That's the nicolating spirit. I if you walk out of here, something bad going to happen to you. And you know that that's the kind of nicolate. Once you hear that and once you hear the control of the people, you know that's the doctrine of the nickel. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It ought you ought to serve God with a freedom with a liberty. &gt;&gt; And that liberty ought to be love. &gt;&gt; But when you become fearful and scared if I leave the church, I might get a heart attack. I might get sick. Something bad going to happen to me. You know you the church physically, the building, the preacher. Amen. I'm scared of that preacher. He might say something. Oh, come on. It ought to not be a fear that I'm scared of God. I'm scared to go to hell. But I got a relationship. I fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people said, "I'll leave that I leave my husband, but I can't leave him because the law said, you know, I got married and I said do the law the death do, but I don't love him no more. So I but I'm bound by the law that stay here and to tough it out because I I I don't love him no more. I don't love her no more. But I'm bound by the law." It ought to not be a law that holds you together. It ought to be love that holds you together. &gt;&gt; It ought to not and see uh um that's what people Amen. You can preach the gospel and you can preach it in a way that people become in bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or you can preach the gospel where the people know that I'm free. Amen. Okay. He said, "Stand fast in the living where Christ has made you free. And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Be behold I Paul saying unto you that if you be circumcised, Christ should profit you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law." Some people they're scared, you know. I I think the church would have been how I mean filled up with people if I just told all the sisters, y'all wear a hat on your head. Y'all just put a hat on and y'all keep that hat on for the It's a group of people. The only reason they ain't coming to this church cuz you ain't got no hat on your head. But if you put a hat on your head, we can win a whole lot of people because you put a hat on your head. Cuz they believe that that hat is almost like uh uh uh it it's going to make them holy. It's a law that you got to do that. You see what I'm saying? And they believe they got it's almost like it put power in you. So I I I I'm saying don't let a doctrine issue uh uh even though if even though if if it was Bible but we know our hair is given to her for a covering and if she have long hair it is glory to her. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So so by the grace of God we we you if you know the truth the truth will make you free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; But I you know the gospel is going God going to give you the opportunity. Amen. If you say you have the love of God in your heart, he's going to give you the opportunity to display and to manifest. That's why James says, "Show me your faith and I'll show you my works." &gt;&gt; Amen. The way I walk, the way I live, the way I conduct my life, I'll show you. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know uh uh many times people amen are trying to live the life of a Christian without the love of God dwelling in them. &gt;&gt; Until Christ get inside of you. That's what gives you the liberty. &gt;&gt; When the love of God comes in your heart, it gives you a liberty. And it's not a a a a duty. It's not a work. It's it it's faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your faith. Amen. Is is not only it's his faith and it's a gift that God gives you. It's one of the uh fruits of the spirit is faith. &gt;&gt; Okay, I got to get down to the verse I was trying to get to, but it says in the fourth verse, and Christ has become of no effect to you, whosoever of you are justified by the law, you have fallen from what? &gt;&gt; Grace. You're falling from grace. Now, we're talking about the law of Moses back then, but we're just talking about the law of the church right now. You can get in, you can get in a church that's supposed to be a gospel believing church, but yet you got so many laws and dos and don'ts that the young people never knew that I I I'm living this life because of Warner. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And until you fall in love with God, you going to always believe that you you walk out of here and they had me where I couldn't do this and I couldn't do that. And and they had me in bondage. And and you know, you're raised in the parents, you're not you're not going to do this in my house. You're not going to do that. If you go you do that now, you getting out of here. You know, it's real strict. It's real teachers and, you know, real hard and tough. Amen. So the children live, Amen. They live under insecurity. Their security is not with God. Amen. It becomes their security becomes their parents. It becomes the church. It becomes the preacher. But your security ought to be I'm secured in the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I know he loves me and I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know he died for my sins and Amen. And he set me free from the sin and bondage. Amen. and his love. Amen. I receive the love of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when it becomes a dos and don't salvation. Amen. Not that some you ought not to, you know, you ought to not lie. You ought to not steal. You ought to not commit adultery or fornication. You ought not to do those things, right? &gt;&gt; Because if you got the love of Christ in your heart, you don't &gt;&gt; you don't desire to do those things. It's a because of a lack of the love of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you really love your husband and love your wife, you just wouldn't do those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you love her, you don't wouldn't want to hurt her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because of you know once Amen. the love of God constrains you. Once the love of God is in you and you have that relationship with him and that confidence and the trust. Amen. I trust in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though I cannot keep myself, even though I don't have the ability to save myself, he saved me and he's the one that's keeping me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't save myself. Neither can I keep myself. BUT I'M KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And because of his power, I'M KEPT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE OF his love, I'm saved. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HIS LOVE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he loved me. How about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad he cared about me. Praise God. When I didn't care about him, he cared about me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you walking by sight and not by faith, you don't understand the love of God. Because all you seeing and once you uh once you uh counterminded and once you Amen got a mind of the world and it might be intellectual and you know how to reason with the uh gospel of Jesus Christ reason why you don't do this and why you don't do that and and you know we don't we don't want to take your liberty away from you. We want you just to get deeper in the love of God. I says, you know, we've been preaching hard against this and hard against that. It comes to just about war. The prophet said, I go through the country and I preach against this and preach against that and come back and it's worse than it was. And I I said, you know, I said, I understand him good. You can preach your heart out against all kind of stuff and you're still dealing with the same thing. And I come to the conclusion, you got to love God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to stop sinning and stop doing the things of the world, you got to love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and if you love God, we ain't got no trouble with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you don't love and you say, "Why I can't do this? Why I can't do that? Why I can't go here? Why I can't do that?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can. God didn't never keep you from doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you choose. I set before you life and death. You make your own decisions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Still ain't got there. But I get back over here. Amen. You're fallen from grace. Fifth verse. For we through the spirit waited for the hope of righteousness by what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; By faith. We through the spirit waited for the hope of righteousness by faith. He became sin for us &gt;&gt; that we might be made the righteousness of God through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's not our own righteousness. It's what? The righteousness that he gave us that's only in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how do we get in Christ? by one spirit or we baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; We're children of God by what? By faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of us have been baptized into Christ have what? &gt;&gt; Have put on Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you put on the Lord Jesus Christ, it's not you no more. Amen. For Paul says, I I I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but what? &gt;&gt; Christ. Christ liveth in me. So the one that's supposed to be living is not you anymore. You have a struggle as long as you living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the struggle is over when you become dead. &gt;&gt; Colossians said I when we become dead in Christ and our life is hid in what? &gt;&gt; Christ in God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the life that I now live I live by the faith of son the son of god who gave himself what for me &gt;&gt; so here is amen and the kind of faith now you you don't have the the faith the h the law what the laws require you you have the faith of the son of god &gt;&gt; amen that's the kind of you have Jesus kind of faith &gt;&gt; it's Jesus in you &gt;&gt; it's Jesus in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the Jesus that's doing it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I'm walking. Amen. But I'm walking in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise. I'M WALKING BY FAITH, &gt;&gt; NOT BY SIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S THE GLORY GOD. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST MOVING. &gt;&gt; UNTIL THE HOLY GHOST CAN TAKE A HOLD OF YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T GET THE HOLY GHOST UNTIL YOU FALL IN love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can feel good and you can Amen. FEEL EMOTIONAL THRILLS. AMEN. BUT SOMETHING GOT TO HIT DOWN DEEP IN YOUR SOUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S GOT TO GO DEEP ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF GOD GOT TO COME. AMEN. SO DOWN IN YOUR SOUL THAT SOMETHING RISE UP IN YOU. AMEN. AND IT'S A POWER OF GOD &gt;&gt; THAT TAKES OVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And to that power.

Praise God. I I wonder why sometimes the church is dead. Wonder why the spirit of people ain't happy. Don't have joy. Don't have peace. Faith without works is what? &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "Ye are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus under what? Good works." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're workers together. What? With him. Are you with me? So, it's got to be something inside of you, Lord. Amen. You call me into the kingdom for such an hour as this. Amen. You save me for such an hour as this.

HALLELUJAH. CAN GOD COME IN? &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AND LIFT YOU UP ABOVE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE, ABOVE YOUR SITUATION, ABOVE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, ABOVE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; HEY, GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I want that agape love in me. &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to have preeminence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, you speak what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If your heart can't love your brother, your you it it'll come at you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You say, "Oh, who that she thinks she is? Who you think he is? Where L?" Well, when the love of God comes inside of you, you way above that. You don't even think like that. &gt;&gt; You don't even worry about those things. Why? You're setting your affection on what? &gt;&gt; Things above. Amen. I got to get wrapped in faith. I got to get out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. set my affection on things above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm out of I'm out of kindergarten, man. We got it going on in college and get our PhD. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Folks want to stay in elementary school. Amen. But it's time to get your PhD. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You come and get your doctrine from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you. It says here in the verse I was trying to get to sixth verse for for in Jesus Christ neither what &gt;&gt; availth anything nor what &gt;&gt; Amen. But what &gt;&gt; faith workketh by love. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see faith really work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't forgive nobody till you love them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you don't love them, you won't forgive them. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You hold a grudge and hold a grudge. He said, "Well, I done forgave them." Amen. But I never sat down beside them. And I shake their hand, but I I know they know something wrong. You got to love your enemy. Amen. You can't do that. What you want to do? You know the fruits of the spirit and the works of the flesh and the fruits of the spirit. How the fruits of the spirit going to be activated in a life that don't have the love of God in it? &gt;&gt; You got to get the spirit before you have the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God. So we we're coming somewhere and we're getting somewhere. Amen. A lot of people, is your faith alive or is it dead? Look at somebody. He said, "Don't shake hand now." Look at somebody. Your faith alive or is it dead? &gt;&gt; See, cuz faith without works is what? &gt;&gt; Dead. &gt;&gt; Dead. He said, "And if it's dead, that mean you ain't got it." Because he said the body without the spirit is what? &gt;&gt; Dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if the body without the spirit is dead, then you have faith without the Holy Ghost. Without the spirit, faith workketh by what? &gt;&gt; Love. And the Holy Ghost is the love of God shed abroad in your heart. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. You got to have love to overcome these things. He said, "Well, brother, I know I love God, but let's go back to James." And I I closed. I said I was going to be short tonight. I told Rachie those I'll be very short tonight. Lord's willing. Faith workketh by love. I I hope you work out your soul's salvation with fear and trembling. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a love and a trust to God that I fear. I don't I'm not afraid of going to hell, afraid of being lost. Amen. The fear I have is the love and the reverence I have for him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the fear that you have for God should be a love and respect and a reverence for God. But if you don't have that reverence and that love, the love is made perfect and perfect faith. Your faith is made perfect through work how you respond to the word, how you act upon the word for your works. Let's let's read it. Okay. Uh, I'll pick back up to 20 verse 2 and 20. It said, "But will thou know, oh vain man, that faith without works is what?" &gt;&gt; Was not Abraham our father justified by what? &gt;&gt; When he had offered up Isaac at his son upon the altar. Amen. The Bible says Abraham was the father of faith. Ain't that right? Seeing thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith what &gt;&gt; prophet of God spoke the message perfect faith praise God faith that's perfect faith amen see God wanted to perfect the captain of our salvation made was being made perfect through what the things he suffered isn't that right Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. People look like they suffering if they come to church. Man, it was cold outside. Man, it was raining. Oh, I'm suffering. Suffering. Oh, man. Oh, I'm suffering. Oh, that was I'm suffering. If somebody said they don't like you or somebody the boss man give you a hard day, I'm suffering, man. And these people is getting their head chopped off, cut off, putting it burnt up to the stakes, doing all kind of stuff to them. And you suffering. Oh, I'm going through. Oh, Lord, you're going through mind battles. Amen. Praise God. But he said, "Let this mind be in you with also in Christ Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he he said, "Oh Lord, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God." Amen. And he said, "No, don't be conformed to this world, but be you what?" &gt;&gt; By the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable in what? &gt;&gt; Perfect will of God. You want to you you want the perfect will of God. You want perfect faith. You want, Amen. to walk in a perfect faith. Amen. Then you know the perfect will of God is his word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now hear the word. It ought to not be a strain on us. Amen. to to live a godly life and to walk amen godly and be holy. He said, "Be holy if I am holy." But he gives you holy the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you can be holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not something that's unattainable, but it's attainable. Why? Because he gives you his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. So by the grace of God, hallelujah, he says, "And by works was faith made what?" Perfect. Amen. For the scripture was fulfilled which said, "Abraham what?" &gt;&gt; Believe God. And it was &gt;&gt; imputed unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; It was imputed. God, hey, don't worry about a thing. If you believe God, God says, hey, it's imputed. I Yeah, I look at it and God says, you're righteous. Amen. All you got to do is believe. He said, well, okay. But Abraham faith that he had was an evident proven by him offering up Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because the way we live, the way we conduct our lives is a manifest token of the life that's inside of us. The faith that we believe, the faith that we have received. Amen. Our life is a manifestation of the faith of God and our walk and our talk. Amen. We're working out our soul salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That our lives is Amen. is manifesting the works of the I mean the the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's Christ that's working in us. It's not us just doing the work. It's the working of the spirit. The Holy Ghost is working &gt;&gt; by the law is the dos and don'ts. Amen. And they had to do it by the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a spiritual thing. It was a fleshly thing. &gt;&gt; The law of Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the law of faith. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God &gt;&gt; and it was imputed in him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you believe God, you don't have to worry about a thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I get some somebody to believe and accept Jesus Christ. It's easy to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But what happened to a person that comes and get baptized in Jesus Christ's name and does not believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They haven't repented. &gt;&gt; Amen. They haven't accepted him. &gt;&gt; What happened to the people that received the message? Amen. By intellectual knowledge but not but not by revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sooner or later they think they in bondage. Praise God. Because they got a Amen. They were born in it. Praise God. And this is the way you know this is this becomes traditional worship. &gt;&gt; We don't want a traditional worship. We want a life living worship. &gt;&gt; We want a living God. &gt;&gt; We want to know him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want the power of this life. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; I WANT GOD TO BE MADE MANIFESTED. I WANT HIS POWER TO BE ACTIVATED in my life. &gt;&gt; Your faith to have action, &gt;&gt; your faith to have works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all don't know where where I'm at, y'all. Y'all don't know. It says it was 23. And the scripture was fulfilled which said Abraham believed and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a what? &gt;&gt; A friend of God. &gt;&gt; He said I'm a friend of God. Amen. The song says I'm a friend of God. Amen. You call me friend. And you see then that how by works a man is justified and not by what? &gt;&gt; Faith only. &gt;&gt; And not by faith only. Amen. Cuz a lot of people believe the devil. It says up ahead, the devil what? &gt;&gt; The devil believe in what? &gt;&gt; He ain't got no work. He can't live this life, can he? And he he won't live it. Amen. He believe it. He know it right. &gt;&gt; But he'll never be able to live it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So you got a lot of people Amen. They say, "I believe. I believe. I believe." But they never be able to live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because just believe in the devil do that. &gt;&gt; The demons do that. They believe, but they tremble. But it's when the love of God gets mixed up with your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you want hence wills to be done. &gt;&gt; God, I want to do your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to have your way. I want to surrender all to you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want you to live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot. Amen. Did I skip something? Okay. the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way. See some don't don't just sit around and come to church and don't never want to do nothing for the Lord. Don't even want to clap your hand. Lord have mercy. That's that that is a believer ain't it? I believe in God. Somebody got to tell you clap your hand. Everybody stand up and praise THE LORD. EVERYBODY, WELL, LET'S WORSHIP GOD. OH, GOODNESS. SORRY. SORRY. Dead faith. You got to be compelled to worship God after all he done for you. &gt;&gt; And somebody got to pump you up to worship him. Somebody got to Amen. make you feel bad if you don't worship him. It ain't about making you feel bad or trying to pump YOU UP. JUST LOVE the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I love you. &gt;&gt; This is what I want to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I want to worship you. I want to praise you. I WANT TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU. I THANK YOU. WHEN I COME INTO YOUR COURTS, I COME IN WITH thanksgiving on my heart. I COME IN WITH A PRAISE ON MY HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

People that love the devil, they show can praise him IN THOSE BALL GAMES. GO CAROLINA. Go Clemson. Go this that because they love that. They get all their joy out of that.
