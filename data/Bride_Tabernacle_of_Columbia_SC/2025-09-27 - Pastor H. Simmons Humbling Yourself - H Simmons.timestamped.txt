[34:55] [Music]
[34:58] James 4
[35:00] and 6.
[35:02] James 4 and 6.
[35:06] But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he
[35:08] said, God resists the proud and giveth
[35:11] grace to the humble.
[35:13] Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[35:16] Resist the devil and he would flee from
[35:18] you. Draw nigh to God and he would draw
[35:21] nigh to you. Clean your hands, ye
[35:24] sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
[35:26] doubleminded.
[35:29] Be afflicted and moan and weep. Let your
[35:33] laughter be turned into morning and your
[35:35] joy into heaviness.
[35:37] Humble yourselves in the sight of God,
[35:41] and he shall what?
[35:43] &gt;&gt; He will lift you up. God bless the
[35:45] reader's word. You may be seated.
[35:49] It's very important
[35:51] that we humble ourselves.
[35:54] That was a requirement. That's what God
[35:58] uh first Peter uh 5 and five
[36:02] and I'll read the fourth verse while
[36:04] you're turning. And when the chief
[36:06] shepherd shall appear,
[36:09] ye shall receive a crown of glory that
[36:12] fadeth not away. Oh, you're looking
[36:15] forward to it, brother, sister.
[36:18] sheep shepherd shall appear. Wherefore
[36:21] likewise ye younger submit yourselves
[36:24] unto the elder. And yay all of you be
[36:30] subject one to another and clothed with
[36:33] what?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Humility. For God what?
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Resists the proud.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; He resists the proud but giveth what?
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Praise to the humble. Then he says here
[36:44] in the sixth verse, humble who
[36:46] &gt;&gt; yourself
[36:47] &gt;&gt; therefore under the what?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; God
[36:50] &gt;&gt; that he may what?
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Exalt you.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Cast all your cares where?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Upon him.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; For he what?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Cares for you.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; He says be soful, be viligent because
[37:06] your what?
[37:09] as a roaring lion is not one but he as
[37:13] one walketh about seeking whom he may
[37:18] what
[37:19] &gt;&gt; whom resists steadfast in the faith
[37:24] knowing that the same afflictions
[37:26] are accomplished in your brethren
[37:30] that are in the world
[37:33] but God but the God of all grace
[37:37] who has called us unto his eternal
[37:41] glory. Are you with me?
[37:44] &gt;&gt; He called us to his eternal glory by
[37:47] Christ Jesus.
[37:49] The after that ye have what?
[37:53] &gt;&gt; It's very difficult to understand that
[37:57] God has a way of strengthening us.
[38:01] God's blessing sometimes is in our
[38:05] suffering.
[38:07] He says,
[38:09] "But after you've suffered a while, make
[38:13] you what?"
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[38:17] The captain of our salvation made
[38:19] perfect through what?
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Suffering. After you suffered a while,
[38:25] sometimes people run because they don't
[38:27] want to go through nothing.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. That's right.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; But we consider the adversary the devil.
[38:35] The devil will be around to
[38:38] come against you and cause things to
[38:42] happen cause you might look at one
[38:45] another and and might be thinking that
[38:49] your problem is in one another. But the
[38:52] problem is that the devil will Amen. get
[38:55] inside of anybody at any time. If you
[38:59] have a door open, a gate open in your
[39:02] spirit.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; But you must be
[39:06] not ignorant of Satan devices. You must
[39:09] be wise enough to understand that the
[39:14] devil is just Amen. God is allowing the
[39:17] devil to do certain things, to say
[39:19] certain things. Amen. Just Amen. for you
[39:23] to be an overcomer and be victorious.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; And we know that all things will work
[39:28] together to the good
[39:30] &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; And because you love him, Amen. that
[39:35] there's no temptation taking you. But
[39:37] such is common to man.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; But God will with the temptation make a
[39:42] way of escape.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; So you must understand that, Amen. that
[39:47] God wants you to humble yourself. Amen.
[39:50] that he might exalt you.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's difficult for to be
[39:56] exalted. Amen. Because God resistes the
[40:00] proud, but he gives grace to the humble.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet God was talking about real
[40:08] power. Amen. Is not so much as the gifts
[40:12] and the healings and miracles and stuff,
[40:14] but a real power is to be able to humble
[40:18] yourself.
[40:20] Be able to humble yourself. That's real
[40:22] power. If you want to see real power,
[40:25] humble yourself.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the mighty hand of God and let
[40:30] God exalt you. That's real power. Being
[40:34] humble.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; It says
[40:38] God make you perfect. After he makes you
[40:41] perfect, he establish you. Some people
[40:45] are unstable.
[40:47] But if you humble yourself, God will
[40:50] and allow yourself to suffer something,
[40:53] to go through some things.
[40:56] And we don't know how to take when when
[40:58] when God taking us uh through certain
[41:01] trials and tribulation, we don't know
[41:03] how to take it.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to humble ourselves.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; He make you perfect. He establish you.
[41:16] Then after he established you, he'll
[41:17] what?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; He'll strengthen you. And after he
[41:21] strengthen you, he'll what?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Settle you. See, God got a way of doing
[41:27] things if we allow God to do. Amen.
[41:31] After you suffered a while.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then this is where God is bringing
[41:37] you into the stature of a perfect man
[41:40] where God is working on you, bringing
[41:42] you into maturity after you suffered a
[41:45] while.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] Then God makes you perfect, establish,
[41:51] strengthen, and settle you. And then he
[41:54] says, "To him be glory and dominion
[41:57] forever and ever." Okay. So by the grace
[42:00] of God uh
[42:03] let go back to the sixth verse. Humble
[42:05] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[42:07] hand of God that he may what?
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Exalt
[42:12] &gt;&gt; exalt you and
[42:15] &gt;&gt; it's coming.
[42:17] As long as you stay humble, he he come.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Hum
[42:23] yourselves is simply sometimes just
[42:26] waiting on God. Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Waiting on him and uh a a and knowing
[42:34] that God hadn't forgotten about you.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; It's very
[42:42] real to see uh somebody going through a
[42:46] trial and how they cannot be patient
[42:49] enough
[42:51] to wait and see the Lord deliverance.
[42:57] But instead of waiting, they get
[42:59] impatient.
[43:01] But God is doing something in your
[43:04] trial, in your test.
[43:07] He resistes the proud, but give grace to
[43:09] the humble. If you can just say, Lord,
[43:12] oh, you know, God just working on you,
[43:15] beating. I mean, in other words, he he
[43:18] he's beating all the all the pride out
[43:21] you, all the self-confidence, all your
[43:23] ability, all your Oh, you just want to
[43:27] take matters in your own hand. Oh, can
[43:30] you see Jesus? Oh, I got power to call
[43:34] 12 legion of angels. I I y'all don't
[43:38] have to take this.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he knew that, Amen. that he's
[43:43] the captain of our salvation. Yes.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew I'm going through this.
[43:48] Amen. That others might Amen. might be
[43:51] have the ability and have the strength
[43:54] to be able to overcome the trials and
[43:57] testes of life.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; So I I I'm taking it.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] He beared
[44:06] our sins and our sicknesses in his own
[44:10] body. He went through for us. Okay.
[44:13] Let's go to Romans
[44:15] uh I mean excuse me Philippians 2
[44:18] Philippians 2
[44:23] and five it says
[44:26] let this mind be in you let this mind be
[44:30] in you. See
[44:35] sometimes we got to see whether or not I
[44:39] we have the mind of Christ or not.
[44:42] He says,
[44:44] you know, be not conformed to this
[44:47] world, but be ye transformed by the
[44:50] renewing of your mind that you might
[44:53] prove what is that good and acceptable
[44:56] and what?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Perfect will of God.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] And the mind of Christ, Amen. He said in
[45:05] the world you going to have you going to
[45:06] go through some stuff. It's it's
[45:09] impossible that offense will not come.
[45:11] So you gonna go through some stuff. It's
[45:13] how you handle it.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Whether you take things in your own hand
[45:18] or whether you allow God to move.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I fix it? Can I I I'mma do
[45:25] something about it. I'll show you who I
[45:27] am. We don't want to see you.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; We want to see Jesus.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus, what? How do I handle this
[45:36] situation, God? If I don't know what I'm
[45:38] doing, then let me get out the way and
[45:41] let you do it.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; See, because often times I didn't know I
[45:46] I I come up with solutions and I try to
[45:49] handle situations sometime, but
[45:52] sometimes humbling yourself and
[45:55] realizing that you don't know what
[45:56] you're doing.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; A and if you Amen. just do something
[46:02] because you know often times you know
[46:04] it's all in protection and protecting
[46:07] our image.
[46:09] Amen. Making us feel I'm a man, I'm a
[46:12] this and you know how we getting macho.
[46:16] Amen. Ain't nobody going to do me like
[46:18] this. You know what I'm saying?
[46:20] Sometimes Amen. parents have to prove to
[46:24] the children
[46:26] I'm daddy here.
[46:29] Mama, you going
[46:32] you you going to respect me. Sometimes,
[46:36] you know, when they get up to an age of
[46:38] teenager, they going to show out.
[46:41] They going they going to do some stuff
[46:43] and say some stuff
[46:46] that you like to. But you got to pray.
[46:51] You got to pray hard, don't you? Yes.
[46:54] Lord have mercy. And don't just don't
[46:56] just be fussing. Get some wisdom. God, I
[46:59] it's some fasting and praying going to
[47:02] take me because I can't beat it out of
[47:04] them cuz it ain't coming out that way.
[47:07] So, I'm going to have to pray. I'm going
[47:09] have to seek God. I'm going to say,
[47:11] "Lord, they in your hand. Give me wisdom
[47:14] to deal with these situations."
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Often times we need wisdom and we have
[47:22] to pray for wisdom. Sometime God gives
[47:25] us wisdom when we can handle God ain't
[47:28] going to release us the wisdom until we
[47:31] actually take our suffering
[47:34] &gt;&gt; until we go through some things. Then
[47:36] God releases to us. Amen. His perfection
[47:40] and he shows us how to handle situation
[47:43] because you're in the way.
[47:46] Amen. You're in the way. God can't do
[47:48] nothing until you get out the way. Amen.
[47:52] As long as you in the way. Amen. God
[47:55] cannot bless you because you in the way
[47:58] of the blessing.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us die to ourselves. Let us
[48:03] resist the devil and he will flee from
[48:06] us.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes, Amen. Amen. We're not
[48:10] resisting the devil. Amen. We actually
[48:13] being like the devil.
[48:20] But we got to resist the devil and he'll
[48:23] flee for from us. We say what we know we
[48:27] shouldn't have said and do what we know
[48:29] we shouldn't have done. Amen. And what
[48:32] happened? Then you real
[48:35] now who we didn't resist the devil.
[48:39] Amen. The resisted devil. Humble
[48:41] yourself. Resist the devil here. What?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Flee.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil ain't going nowhere when
[48:48] you in the way.
[48:50] Amen. Because you you you you're no
[48:53] match for the devil. Amen. But God
[48:57] bringing us to the statue of a perfect
[48:59] man. So we got to have temperance. We
[49:01] got to have patience, right? Because
[49:03] that's what God is bringing us into.
[49:06] Amen. But we we lack temperance. We lack
[49:09] patience because in all of that
[49:13] experience working patient and oh
[49:17] goodness we going to have to experience
[49:19] certain things. We have to go through
[49:20] certain things.
[49:26] But we don't wait.
[49:28] We just got to I got to be patient. I
[49:31] got to be patient. Talking it ain't
[49:34] going to get no. You just got to do it.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; And how do you do it? Resist the devil.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; How you resist the devil? The devil
[49:42] trying to get keep you from being
[49:44] patient.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; The devil trying to keep you from being
[49:47] tempered.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Your temper,
[49:51] you start shaking
[49:59] and you're trying to hold back, but you
[50:01] got to resist the devil
[50:04] that you don't have to shake no more
[50:07] because Amen. God doesn't give you
[50:09] victory, overcoming power.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; But what? Why? Amen. You're humbling
[50:14] yourself. Said that's all the devil want
[50:17] to do. Get me upset and get my pressure
[50:18] up and do this and that and get me all
[50:20] worked up and say something that I
[50:22] shouldn't have said. Do something. Well,
[50:26] you didn't resist the devil.
[50:29] You let the devil have his way.
[50:32] But let us not do that.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. Jesus, you know, he was tempted to
[50:40] all
[50:43] just like we were. Five, he said, "Let
[50:46] this mind be also in you that was in
[50:48] Christ, which is in Christ
[50:50] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[50:54] thought it not robbery to be what?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; But made of himself of no reputation,
[51:00] and took upon him the form of a what?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Servant."
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Servant. and was made in the likeness of
[51:07] men.
[51:09] Mhm.
[51:13] Sometimes God God want us to be bold. He
[51:16] wants us to use the rod of correction
[51:20] and in that but God wants you to use it
[51:25] with wisdom.
[51:28] Don't use it and that that you use it
[51:32] like the flesh would use it. God gives
[51:35] you more wisdom, give you more grace. He
[51:38] gives us more grace. And if God gives
[51:41] you grace, you got to be able to uh uh
[51:44] you give grace.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God gives you more grace, you
[51:50] give grace.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] Then he says,
[51:57] "He thought it not robbery to be equal
[51:59] with God and made of himself no
[52:01] reputation."
[52:03] Right?
[52:05] And being found in the likeness of men,
[52:11] I mean, and was made in the likeness of
[52:15] men. Amen. And being found in the
[52:17] fashion of a man, he what?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Humbled himself. And I said, "If he
[52:22] humbled himself, you and I got to what?"
[52:24] &gt;&gt; H ourselves.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Humble ourselves. We got to
[52:28] He said, "Well, Lord,
[52:31] I'm doing the best I can."
[52:34] And each time you overcome one thing,
[52:37] then there's another test up ahead.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And when you overcome that test, there's
[52:41] another one. Why?
[52:44] You climbing the l Jacob's ladder.
[52:47] every round go.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; But but if you don't never climb the the
[52:52] first step ladder, the first step,
[52:55] you'll never get to the top.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; You you start off with patience.
[53:02] Amen. And then you go to virtue. But if
[53:06] you don't climb the ladder, you you
[53:08] still ain't got faith.
[53:10] And then you ain't got virtue.
[53:13] Amen.
[53:14] and you keep climbing.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God gives you knowledge, gives you
[53:20] temperance, give you patience. A he
[53:23] comes up to brotherly kindness and then
[53:26] he comes up to charity.
[53:28] Amen.
[53:30] Godliness.
[53:32] Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be like God.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; But uh it it takes something. It takes a
[53:41] round by round.
[53:43] God letting different things come into
[53:46] your life because he knows what it's
[53:49] going to take to for you to come into
[53:51] maturity cuz God allows certain
[53:54] different things, certain different
[53:56] tests, different trials, different
[53:58] temptations. God allows those things to
[54:01] come against you and to come at you and
[54:05] then you Amen. how you handle that then
[54:08] that uh whether you passed the test or
[54:11] not. And then if you fail then you say
[54:15] why did I fail? Because I failed to be
[54:18] patient.
[54:20] I failed to be temperance.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I failed to be godly.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I should have handled in a godly type of
[54:30] way.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; But because I didn't humble myself, God,
[54:35] I didn't handle it with godliness.
[54:39] But I handled it as I was handling it
[54:42] like the flesh. I Amen. Because even my
[54:45] words were not with grace seasoned with
[54:47] salt. My words were
[54:51] in the flesh words.
[54:55] You see what I'm saying? So what
[54:58] happens? Godliness is he he brings you
[55:02] into a a very kindness.
[55:05] Amen. where it's gentle.
[55:09] Oh, you said, "Well, that's what how how
[55:12] do God handle uh uh sheep? How do you
[55:15] you know, how do how do God handle the
[55:18] shepherd handle the sheep?
[55:21] The sheep shepherd when he appears, how
[55:25] does the chief shepherd handle the
[55:28] sheep?
[55:30] And and sometimes we have to see how the
[55:34] chief shepherd handles sheep.
[55:39] And we got to handle Amen. situations as
[55:44] the sheep shepherd handles the bride.
[55:48] Amen. Y'all know I got trouble with
[55:50] saying it, chief.
[55:53] But I got taking my time to say it.
[55:57] might not sound so right, but the best I
[56:00] can do.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let him, you know, be careful
[56:06] that the mind that was in Christ, let it
[56:09] be in you.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "What? Well, how do I know uh
[56:13] I'm humbling myself that, you know,
[56:16] whatever you do in word or deed, do it
[56:18] all in the name of the Lord." And what
[56:21] is that saying? How would h how would
[56:23] Jesus handle this situation?
[56:26] Do you think Jesus will handle it like
[56:28] I'm handling it? If he's not handling it
[56:31] like I'm handling it, then God, I I want
[56:34] to humble myself and I want to handle
[56:36] this situation like you would handle it.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; It's it it's it's very
[56:46] needful that we pray that God would give
[56:50] us wisdom.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] that we come to maturity. Like I say, he
[56:58] ain't coming back for babies.
[57:01] We got to come to maturity, right?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And then in the fashion of a man, he
[57:08] humbled himself and became obedient.
[57:12] Humb himself and became obedient to
[57:14] what?
[57:15] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul says. I'm crucified
[57:18] with Christ.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm crucified with Christ.
[57:22] Nevertheless, I live
[57:25] yet I not I but Christ.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes dying out. Amen.
[57:33] We got to die to ourselves.
[57:36] And and if we die to ourselves, then
[57:39] Christ can be magnified in our bodies.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; We want Christ to be magnified and to be
[57:47] glorified. We want to see the power of
[57:51] the love of God and the wisdom of God.
[57:54] And Amen. We want God to establish us.
[57:57] He want us to We want him to make us
[58:00] perfect, establish, strengthen us, and
[58:02] settled us.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I'm Praise God. I God
[58:08] has done this work in my life.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want him to do a a complete
[58:14] work.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want him to finish what he
[58:18] started.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he when he wanted a bride, he
[58:22] wanted a masterpiece. And when he wanted
[58:24] a masterpiece, he he had to keep
[58:26] chipping at it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And God is chipping. Amen. To make a
[58:31] masterpiece.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. When he can say speak,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have the spoken word
[58:38] now.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] The masterpiece is coming to the
[58:43] fullness. Amen.
[58:48] So by the grace of God
[58:54] even the death of the cross. Amen.
[59:01] Wherefore
[59:04] wherefore in the ninth verse wherefore
[59:06] God also has what?
[59:10] You know that's a you know the people
[59:12] that have overcome and gone through
[59:14] something and the bride talk about
[59:17] taking off in the rapture. Those folk
[59:19] was taken off in the rapture. But I
[59:22] wonder what those folks to uh walk in

[1:26:27] that the word, oh God, might find a
[1:26:30] resting place. And oh God, might
[1:26:32] produce, Lord, that which you sent it to
[1:26:34] do. Lord, we thank you. Bless your
[1:26:37] children now, Lord, as we depart this
[1:26:38] place, but never your presence. We pray
[1:26:41] God that your spirit might be with us.
