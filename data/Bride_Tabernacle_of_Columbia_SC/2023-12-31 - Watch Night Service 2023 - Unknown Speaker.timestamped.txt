[31:43] now thinking that this time last year we
[31:45] was sitting here and praising God and
[31:48] and what God have done for me personally
[31:50] I I share it with you
[31:52] tonight going on 50 years ago I was just
[31:56] in the same neighborhood here on Monella
[31:59] Road where a man witnessed to me and let
[32:01] me know where I was and that was on my
[32:03] way to hell I was a lost soul and
[32:06] knowing about Jesus Christ but did not
[32:08] know him as Lord and Savior and God
[32:11] blessed me that day that day not in his
[32:16] house there I was standing there he and
[32:17] I went to school together here in
[32:19] Columbia I was still fresh out of high
[32:22] school and attended college and he was
[32:25] going to college on the GI Bill was a
[32:27] veteran and he and
[32:29] I worked together at UPS part-time and
[32:33] went to school fulltime together and and
[32:36] parted as young people did as I did I'm
[32:40] confessing and God's been good to me and
[32:43] allowed me to come on along this way but
[32:45] that particular day I'll never forget
[32:47] God allowed this man who I had gone to
[32:50] school with and after graduating part of
[32:53] company and decided to come back and
[32:57] look him up and see what was going on
[32:58] and in that point of time that he and I
[33:01] was separated from each other we he had
[33:05] accepted Christ and he shared with me
[33:09] his testimony and in his talking he said
[33:12] to me de if you continue on living the
[33:14] way you're living you going to burn in
[33:15] hell one day talk on a while longer and
[33:18] remember him telling me if you continue
[33:20] on going like you're going you going to
[33:21] bust H wide
[33:22] open not in know ugly like way but no
[33:25] one kind of life that he and I lived
[33:27] when we were in school
[33:29] together The Parting and the drinking
[33:32] and just going about carousing and doing
[33:34] whatever we thought we were big enough
[33:35] to
[33:37] do I left out of his house convicted but
[33:40] hadn't made my made my mind but on my
[33:43] way back to something that afternoon I
[33:45] always remember that spot in the road
[33:46] where I came to accept Jesus
[33:49] Christ going across that Old Bridge some
[33:53] probably know about it it's down now
[33:55] they replaced it but but it had a gir of
[33:57] beam across the top I don't mean to take
[33:59] so much time but God has been good to me
[34:01] and I share this with you because it's
[34:03] real it's true and going across that
[34:05] river that afternoon I remember
[34:08] saying to Satan because he was saying to
[34:11] me if you make this Choice what the guys
[34:12] is going to think about that you party
[34:14] with and carry on with and all that but
[34:16] about you a Christian what what they
[34:18] going to think about you and I remember
[34:20] going down the road and making my mind
[34:22] up and saying let them think what they
[34:23] want I'm going to Christ I thank God 4 I

[50:29] me and I will say with it and effecture
[50:33] will fervent prayer of the righteous
[50:36] availeth
[50:37] much so God is looking for us to put on
[50:42] as the elect of God he's already made
[50:44] you the elect so now he's telling you
[50:47] not just put it in your spirit but put
[50:49] on your flesh when your flesh don't want
[50:52] to praise God when it don't want to get
[50:54] along with the neighbor the the
[50:55] classmate or the coworker put on as the
[50:58] elect of God holy bows of mercy so you
[51:02] got to put on kindness when you don't
[51:04] feel like it you got to put on kindness
[51:06] when you don't want to as the elect of
[51:09] God put on holy vows of
[51:12] Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind see
[51:15] that's what's wrong with some of us we
[51:17] figure we somebody but when God begin to
[51:20] show you his Mercy in your life and
[51:22] where he brought you from you can be
[51:24] humble and say God I thank you God I can
[51:28] thank you for your mercy you could have
[51:30] left me on the pool table you could have
[51:32] left me at the rra but your Sovereign
[51:34] Grace tonight and your mercy brought me
[51:38] here and it's about love the prophet of
[51:41] God said The more one that just love you
[51:43] know they rais in the
[51:45] church they love little but God brought
[51:49] you out the streets he brought you from
[51:51] the deepest of the sins and the pits of
[51:54] hell then he said one one that lovees
[51:56] little worship little but the one that
[51:58] be brought him from a muck and a myir he
[52:00] said they got great Praise And now when
[52:02] we get in a atmosphere of desperation we
[52:05] can praise God and say Lord I come to
[52:08] thank you I come to create an atmosphere
[52:10] that I can set the whole church on
[52:14] fire amen and above all these things put
[52:18] on charity sometime we don't want to
[52:20] love our neighbors but God said love the
[52:23] ones that hate you love the one that Did
[52:26] You Wrong amen as I was telling the
[52:30] church on this morning I said my
[52:33] niece my sister's
[52:36] daughter I got on her pretty
[52:39] hard living shacking up like people
[52:41] doing these
[52:43] days and I got on her so bad on the
[52:46] phone Ste spot andberg she started
[52:48] crying and she called her
[52:50] mom and my mama said you your brother
[52:54] your uncle my brother is
[52:56] right and for all these years I've been
[52:59] trying to talk to her and she been
[53:00] shunning me away and the Holy Spirit
[53:03] said now it's time to check let's get it
[53:07] right and I called and
[53:10] apologized if I did anything wrong I
[53:12] love you
[53:14] niece except my apology I called and
[53:17] left a voice message and I text her and
[53:21] the Holy Spirit came and said that's
[53:23] what I'm talking about
[53:26] you've made it right with her I might
[53:28] have not been wrong and sometimes the
[53:31] devil say you ain't did nothing wrong so
[53:32] you don't have to apologize but I'm
[53:34] telling you now this is Harvest Time and
[53:36] God is looking for Perfection and he's
[53:39] looking for divine mercy he's looking
[53:41] for humbleness in your heart and you
[53:43] can't think you somebody you're proud
[53:45] who you are or what you are you got to
[53:47] get to the point where God can be
[53:48] glorified and he want that thing fixed
[53:51] and he want it fixed by you other than
[53:53] that you can't go no further
[53:56] prophet of God went to pray for a little
[53:57] girl angel of God said no you can't pray
[54:00] for her go back and make it right you
[54:01] told her lie he went back and made it
[54:04] right and went and prayed for the young
[54:06] girl if God won't let him buy he's not
[54:09] going to let you and I
[54:11] buy so Church to continue to be
[54:15] humbleness of Mind see we can't think we
[54:18] somebody GRE Paul was the greatest
[54:20] Apostle in the Bible but yet he said I
[54:23] count all that I've want
[54:25] or all that I've learned as nothing I
[54:28] counted as dong that I might win Christ
[54:31] so ain't nothing going to hold you if
[54:33] you've been predestinated seed as the
[54:35] prophet said nothing's going to keep you
[54:37] from repenting and getting closer to God
[54:39] why because you was ordained before the
[54:41] foundation of the world you was in the
[54:43] mind of God and all God's thoughts are
[54:44] Eternal so repent and let's go on with
[54:47] God in 2024 that the power of the
[54:49] Resurrection might be in your ministry
[54:52] God bless
[54:54] you

[1:05:40] amen God is good amen we just want to
[1:05:43] read a little scripture then we'll get
[1:05:45] out of the way I told Brother Carl
[1:05:47] Pastor days he went real went real quick
[1:05:51] but God is good amen I want to look at
[1:05:53] Isaiah 60 it's something that been on my
[1:05:55] heart the last uh couple of weeks I was
[1:05:59] preaching on warning signs and then I
[1:06:03] went to the anointing false
[1:06:05] anointings and then we went to hidden
[1:06:07] messages but it was back at the the
[1:06:09] anointing this morning amen just looking
[1:06:12] at the Spirit that's the spirits that
[1:06:14] we're dealing with today the the the
[1:06:17] anointing is and the things that's on
[1:06:18] this age you know that Jesus said if it
[1:06:21] were possible to deceive the very elect
[1:06:23] right that's how close it'll be so you
[1:06:26] know it causes each and every one of us
[1:06:28] to check ourselves up daily right
[1:06:32] because the only thing that's going to
[1:06:33] going to help us to escape the wrath to
[1:06:35] come will be God and His Spirit alone to
[1:06:38] lead us through amen Isaiah 60 by the
[1:06:41] grace of God you got it say amen and it
[1:06:45] reads arise and shine for thy light has
[1:06:49] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:06:52] upon thee for behold the darkness shall
[1:06:54] cover the
[1:06:55] Earth and and gross Darkness to people
[1:06:59] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[1:07:02] His glory shall be seen upon thee and
[1:07:05] the Gentiles shall come to thy light and
[1:07:09] the Kings to the brightness of thy
[1:07:11] raising may God a bless the reading of
[1:07:13] his word I like here we'll talk about
[1:07:16] just a little bit about gross Darkness
[1:07:18] amen I like how he was saying arise and
[1:07:20] shine for thy light is come and the
[1:07:23] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee cuz
[1:07:26] he was saying here he was saying and His
[1:07:29] glory shall be seen upon thee so you
[1:07:33] know I was thinking about the the the
[1:07:35] the hour that we live in the gross
[1:07:36] Darkness I was thinking what sister
[1:07:39] Tasha was saying about how you know you
[1:07:41] get cursed out and and then people say
[1:07:44] well how do you let that see the glory
[1:07:46] of the Lord is going to be seen upon you
[1:07:49] because the more you got to realize we
[1:07:51] live in we live in a real Dark Age
[1:07:54] real it's dark out there y'all I
[1:07:57] remember we was coming back from uh
[1:07:59] somewhere once me and uh charlot and I
[1:08:01] flickered the lights was on one of those
[1:08:03] back back back roads so what I did I
[1:08:06] just flicked the lights just to see when
[1:08:08] those lights go out man it's oo it's
[1:08:12] scary back there when those lights go
[1:08:14] out I said you imagine could you imagine
[1:08:16] car breakdown and brother jald you might
[1:08:19] know what I'm talking about especially
[1:08:20] if the sun the moon and stars ain't out
[1:08:22] man it's dark back there
[1:08:24] but I says but you know out of all out
[1:08:27] out of all that Darkness just the little
[1:08:30] the little lights from your headlights
[1:08:32] you flicker them on it lights up
[1:08:34] everything around you right so you can
[1:08:36] see your way and I begin to just look at
[1:08:38] spiritual aspect of thing I said it's
[1:08:40] it's dark you know and we approaching a
[1:08:42] new year I was saying this morning you
[1:08:45] know God brought us through this year
[1:08:47] brought us through some trials each and
[1:08:49] every one of us through trials some pain
[1:08:51] all but I was telling the church this
[1:08:53] morning I said but I still feel like
[1:08:55] going on I know that the new year come
[1:08:59] we say we we we wish the world will get
[1:09:02] better but the Bible declared that they
[1:09:05] was going to wax worse and worse but
[1:09:08] even in that we going to rise and shine
[1:09:10] because our light has come the darker
[1:09:13] the world gets that's the more that
[1:09:16] you're going to shine the those that are
[1:09:18] living in Christ why because you know
[1:09:20] Darkness and Light they don't mix they
[1:09:22] don't have no Fellowship right and God
[1:09:25] said let there be light you know and
[1:09:26] then he divided the two because they
[1:09:28] they can't mix can they but so the
[1:09:31] darker the world get the more you going
[1:09:33] to
[1:09:34] shine but and the world going to look at
[1:09:36] you like you're the Oddball you're crazy
[1:09:39] but in all reality they lost their minds
[1:09:42] y'all believe that I was I was telling
[1:09:45] uh Charlotte the other day I wasn't we
[1:09:47] was on a little taking a little vacation
[1:09:49] on her birthday so
[1:09:52] uh was in I was in the mall I went to go
[1:09:56] to the Bass Pro Shop but then went to uh
[1:09:58] use the restroom in the bathroom and uh
[1:10:02] somebody come in there with with black
[1:10:04] hood on all black on and they was
[1:10:07] listening to this rock music like heavy
[1:10:10] metal rock or whatever it was and they
[1:10:12] had it blasting and they must have been
[1:10:14] on the phone in their pocket but it was
[1:10:16] so demonic I mean it was like I told
[1:10:20] Charlotte they were saying in a song
[1:10:22] something about sacrific and I'm going
[1:10:24] make sa they was saying they were saying
[1:10:27] all kinds of stuff in the song I said
[1:10:29] Lord I started getting
[1:10:31] nervous guy had to hood on I told charet
[1:10:34] I was like man I had to hurry up get out
[1:10:35] that bathroom my spirit got all messed
[1:10:38] up but I says that I had to shake that
[1:10:41] thing off me you know that you know you
[1:10:44] you cuz what it is we dealing with
[1:10:46] Spirits ain't it gross Darkness I I
[1:10:49] thought about how I was preaching on
[1:10:50] hidden messages I was saying but in that
[1:10:52] music he was listening to that wasn't
[1:10:54] hidden they telling you what they what
[1:10:56] they about right but I says that I was
[1:11:00] telling charlat I got back in the car
[1:11:02] cuz it Vex you it Vex my spirit now and
[1:11:04] that's what it says you know things the
[1:11:07] way the world going it Vex you don't
[1:11:10] it and it's like the uh sister I think L
[1:11:14] Willie was saying our children got to
[1:11:15] live in this world so how can you not
[1:11:18] pray for them right when the things they
[1:11:21] got to contend with right the demons I
[1:11:25] mean just demonic right the the the
[1:11:28] spirits they got to contend with how can
[1:11:30] you not pray for them and cry out to
[1:11:32] them I mean cry out to God for them that
[1:11:35] that God will have mercy on them and
[1:11:37] protect them and keep them because you
[1:11:39] know the world the world is I was
[1:11:41] telling uh charlet you know she wanted
[1:11:44] to go to the a Jamaican restaurant so we
[1:11:47] we found one but I tell I don't think
[1:11:50] that was the best
[1:11:52] neighborhood and and but just while she
[1:11:55] was in there picking the food up I told
[1:11:57] her I was the the things I
[1:11:59] saw just while she was in I said you
[1:12:02] know we living in a dangerous
[1:12:05] world the things I seen taking place
[1:12:08] just why she was in there I don't know
[1:12:09] if it was just God dealing with us
[1:12:11] Opening Our Eyes just just so we we cry
[1:12:14] out to him more that God we need your
[1:12:16] protection it's it's borderline
[1:12:19] sometimes you know the Bible say
[1:12:20] Darkness was going to cover the Earth
[1:12:22] but gross Darkness to
[1:12:24] people it's dark out there ain't it it's
[1:12:27] dark but I thank God that he still give
[1:12:31] give us the light he still put it in our
[1:12:33] heart to want to serve him you know
[1:12:35] everybody going one way and they oh you
[1:12:38] should do this you that or there but
[1:12:40] it's still in your heart to want to live
[1:12:42] right it's still in your heart to want
[1:12:44] to be holy still in your heart to not
[1:12:46] want to cheat not want still in your
[1:12:48] heart to want to please God you know
[1:12:50] only God can put that in your heart
[1:12:52] because a lot lot of times you know we
[1:12:55] think you know oh we just God will
[1:12:58] understand but if he'll keep those that
[1:13:00] want to be kept do you want to be kept
[1:13:03] because God will keep you if you want to
[1:13:05] be kept you know I was sharing with um
[1:13:08] with uh the church this morning we was
[1:13:10] talking about uh Israel and the moabites
[1:13:12] I say you know they they went and up to
[1:13:15] the feast and they joined up with them
[1:13:16] didn't they and God didn't like that I
[1:13:19] says you know God calls us out to be
[1:13:22] separate I says we don't have to join up
[1:13:25] and and or make uh you know compromise
[1:13:29] and all that for strength I said because
[1:13:31] we already blessed God brought us out he
[1:13:34] brought us from a mighty long way too
[1:13:36] didn't he I said we already blessed I
[1:13:38] don't know about you but I said I'm
[1:13:40] already blessed I don't have to
[1:13:42] compromise to get blessings compromise
[1:13:44] that I'm already blessed and the trials
[1:13:47] and the things that God take us through
[1:13:49] we look at them as as as helping us to
[1:13:52] gain a um wisdom not only wisdom but
[1:13:56] also to gain more faith in him and also
[1:13:58] character it's a character building
[1:14:00] process you go through these trials say
[1:14:02] Lord you know I don't know what the
[1:14:04] trials that you've been through that
[1:14:06] we've been through this year you out to
[1:14:08] had come out stronger than you did then
[1:14:10] before you went in you came out you look
[1:14:12] at the things you've been through you
[1:14:13] say Lord I trust you now more than I did
[1:14:16] at the beginning of the
[1:14:17] year because you brought me through this
[1:14:19] and you brought me through that come on
[1:14:22] and even right now situations might look
[1:14:24] like they're still uh uh unfinished but
[1:14:27] nevertheless I know one thing god holds
[1:14:30] tomorrow now he does don't he I'm
[1:14:33] learning right now to put everything in
[1:14:35] God Hand I'm learning to trust in him
[1:14:39] and let him do the work come on all I I
[1:14:42] I was praying uh yesterday I said Lord
[1:14:45] what I want to do you know we don't make
[1:14:47] resolutions but I just want to get
[1:14:49] closer to you that's what I want to do
[1:14:52] the year coming I want to get closer to
[1:14:54] you I thought about how you he talking
[1:14:57] about repairing the altar the altar torn
[1:14:59] down you got to repair the altar come on
[1:15:01] you got to get down back down on your
[1:15:03] knees more go back to where you started
[1:15:05] at where did you start you if you was
[1:15:07] started right you was down on your knees
[1:15:09] somewhere crying out to God depending on
[1:15:11] him from everything I said God take us
[1:15:13] all back I I definitely want to go back
[1:15:15] to that because as the world is going
[1:15:17] one way God I want to draw closer and
[1:15:20] more nigh to you so what I want to do
[1:15:23] this this year coming I was I sharing
[1:15:25] you know as God been dealing with our
[1:15:27] hearts see what we got to do as
[1:15:29] individuals we got to we got to ask God
[1:15:32] to quit us like men right and not look
[1:15:36] so much to the carnal things and begin
[1:15:38] to allow allow God to allow you to look
[1:15:40] at spiritual things because you know
[1:15:44] Jesus when he was talking about the the
[1:15:46] parable of the sword soaring seeds the
[1:15:48] one I always that always stuck out to me
[1:15:50] was the one that was sown among thorns
[1:15:53] and
[1:15:54] thistles that's the one always stuck out
[1:15:56] to me because he says that they
[1:15:59] represented the cares of this life that
[1:16:01] when the seed begin to grow up the
[1:16:03] thorns and the represent the cares of
[1:16:05] his life choke the word out of them and
[1:16:06] they become unfruitful come on I said
[1:16:10] Lord that's that's what I what I want I
[1:16:12] don't want nothing to choke the word out
[1:16:14] of me I don't if I got to get something
[1:16:17] where I got to work twice as hard do all
[1:16:19] here and and miss out on you just to
[1:16:21] keep it I don't want it right
[1:16:23] I only want the the blessings that that
[1:16:25] that's going to bring me closer to God
[1:16:28] right but we find that I say one thing
[1:16:30] and I'm going to say this I'm going sit
[1:16:31] down tonight but God is God is bringing
[1:16:35] us to some things you know what was on
[1:16:37] my heart and I shared a little bit this
[1:16:39] morning I says you know uh cuz my dad
[1:16:42] was telling me about somebody that
[1:16:43] passed away and I was saying you know
[1:16:45] they lived a hard life man they lived a
[1:16:48] real hard life my dad say yeah they
[1:16:51] drunk their s to death
[1:16:54] that's what they did I said man that was
[1:16:56] hard but I it it it did something to my
[1:16:59] heart I said because what happens is
[1:17:02] don't people people are searching for
[1:17:06] something people have things they got
[1:17:08] something it all that all that drinking
[1:17:11] all the drugging all the the women the
[1:17:13] men all that stuff they doing they they
[1:17:16] trying to satisfy something that's
[1:17:19] missing now sometimes stuff happen to
[1:17:22] people and only God can take them back
[1:17:24] to help them deal with that
[1:17:26] situation but they use all these other
[1:17:30] substitutes to try to drown out to to to
[1:17:34] drown out what they really I I says that
[1:17:37] person I was sh I was sharing my wife I
[1:17:39] says people just be wanting rest
[1:17:42] sometimes they that's what they
[1:17:44] searching for they searching for rest or
[1:17:46] they searching for peace or they looking
[1:17:49] for
[1:17:50] Joy but they don't know where where the
[1:17:52] real peace is or where the real Joy is
[1:17:56] or where the real rest is so they use
[1:17:58] all these other things to substitute it
[1:18:00] right and it don't last long it's just a
[1:18:03] sub it's a quick fix it ain't going to
[1:18:05] last come on it's just going to bring
[1:18:07] more sorrows and more Sorrows upon you
[1:18:09] and tear you down in the end ain't it
[1:18:12] but like I was sharing with uh Charlotte
[1:18:14] and I was telling the church this
[1:18:15] morning I if if they would only
[1:18:18] know that Jesus is the answer if they
[1:18:23] would only know that all they searching
[1:18:26] the rest that they they trying uh to get
[1:18:29] the rest that they Desiring if they
[1:18:31] would only know that Jesus is that
[1:18:34] rest I was saying if they would only
[1:18:36] know that peace that they looking for
[1:18:39] God on God knows the hand you was dealt
[1:18:41] in life God knows what you're going
[1:18:43] through God know what you've been
[1:18:44] through God know you need peace but he
[1:18:46] said the peace I give you ain't like the
[1:18:48] peace the world can give you I said if
[1:18:50] they only knew that he was the real
[1:18:53] peace they was looking for if they only
[1:18:55] knew he was the real JY that they was
[1:18:57] looking for if they that's why I believe
[1:18:59] David said taste and see that the Lord
[1:19:01] is good if they only knew Hallelujah but
[1:19:05] I'm glad I found out one day you know
[1:19:08] I'm glad that in all of my carrying on
[1:19:11] Deon walk was saying I'll tell everybody
[1:19:14] I hit rock bottom at 19 years old
[1:19:17] searching but I'm glad in and at my rock
[1:19:20] bottom I found something I found a real
[1:19:23] rock is what I found come on but it
[1:19:25] wasn't that I found him but he found me
[1:19:28] and I'm glad that he did because that's
[1:19:29] where the real rest is you say you
[1:19:32] resting yes I'm resting because I'm not
[1:19:35] worried about what's going to happen
[1:19:36] tomorrow I Know Who Holds Tomorrow I
[1:19:38] know who's taking care of every
[1:19:40] situation I'm resting yes I'm resting on
[1:19:43] what his word said cuz that can't fail
[1:19:46] Hallelujah he said I'll never leave you
[1:19:48] nor forsake you but I'll be with you and
[1:19:51] I believe it too
[1:19:53] that's why I serve him the way I do
[1:19:55] because I believe what he said and I
[1:19:57] ain't afraid brother Caleb to remind God

[1:25:08] year in October um I was having really
[1:25:10] bad chest pains so I ignored it which
[1:25:14] was the wrong thing to do um I was
[1:25:17] taking Molin and Tylenol just thinking
[1:25:19] it would go away um did not go away so I
[1:25:22] drove myself to the hospital and um I
[1:25:26] told them when I got there I said I need
[1:25:27] a CT scan with contrast cuz something's
[1:25:30] going on and I didn't know what it was
[1:25:32] and so they were like um no we can't do
[1:25:36] that and I told them no I know what I
[1:25:38] need so they did a d dier which is a
[1:25:40] blood test to look for blood clots and
[1:25:43] my D dier was elevated so they
[1:25:45] immediately um did a CT scan with
[1:25:47] contrast so they did that the results
[1:25:50] came back I had a Mass above my heart
[1:25:54] the size of a bar soap and the thickness
[1:25:57] of a bar soap so I had to go to um
[1:26:03] several um surgeons to try to see um how
[1:26:07] they were going to get this Mass out
[1:26:09] because I was having a lot of pain a lot
[1:26:12] of shortness of breath um just really
[1:26:15] tired just exhausted so I finally found
[1:26:19] a surgeon at Prisma health and I had to
[1:26:21] have open heart surgery in March of this
[1:26:24] year um I want to thank the Lord he
[1:26:27] brought me through that um
[1:26:30] also when my followup was in March no
[1:26:34] yeah it was the end of March when I had
[1:26:36] to go back to my surgeon um he told me
[1:26:39] he said well this when we took out that
[1:26:41] Mas it was a tumor and he said that they
[1:26:44] found cancer cells so um it say so you
[1:26:49] need to go to South Carolina on ecology
[1:26:51] um you know and get checked out for
[1:26:53] further testing so I went there and um
[1:26:58] my onocologist that I talked to she said
[1:27:00] well we don't have the results right now
[1:27:03] of your test and everything so she said
[1:27:05] we're just waiting and um and she began
[1:27:08] to talk about me having radiation done
[1:27:13] and um she was just talking about
[1:27:15] radiation she was talking about chemo
[1:27:18] possibly chemother therapy to kill these
[1:27:21] CS to kill the sales and so when she was
[1:27:24] talking I was paralyzed with fear I was
[1:27:28] I was I was cuz I began to think about
[1:27:31] everybody else you know the um brothers
[1:27:33] and sisters that were in church that may
[1:27:35] have passed away and I was thinking Lord
[1:27:38] is this the way I'm going to go um with
[1:27:40] chemo
[1:27:41] radiation and I heard a still Small
[1:27:45] Voice that said say how what you want
[1:27:49] done and so while the doctor was talking
[1:27:54] I said I will not have to have
[1:27:58] radiation I said you you guys will not
[1:28:01] find cancer cells I said you will not
[1:28:04] find cancer cells when the results come
[1:28:06] back and I said that's what I believe
[1:28:09] and she kind of just looked at me like
[1:28:12] yeah right so um I had to wait two weeks
[1:28:16] to get my results back and she didn't
[1:28:19] call me so she sent me an email and and
[1:28:22] she said um she said Miss red you we did
[1:28:26] not find any cancer cells she said you
[1:28:30] will not have to take radiation or chemo
[1:28:33] um we're just going to do just a six
[1:28:35] Monon followup um for year and then come
[1:28:39] back every other year um and I thank the
[1:28:42] Lord for that I thank the Lord that you
[1:28:45] know for that comfort and um you know in
[1:28:49] just for in listening to the voice of

[1:28:52] and being bold enough to speak in that
[1:28:55] doctor's office you know and let the
[1:28:57] doctors know you know you're not going
[1:28:59] to find this you know is not going to be
[1:29:02] there and I believe that and I just want
[1:29:06] to let everybody know you know keep your
[1:29:08] promise to God whatever you say to God

[1:30:11] always moved in unexpected ways um a
[1:30:14] couple years ago maybe about about four
[1:30:16] or five years ago um I was what you call
[1:30:18] wild turkey hunting and um I was going
[1:30:21] to a certain area you know from the from
[1:30:24] the forest to the to this big power line
[1:30:27] and I kept asking myself say what's I
[1:30:29] said Lord why why aren't you like moving
[1:30:31] in my life like um supernaturally and
[1:30:34] whatnot so I kept asking them so um as I
[1:30:38] kept walking something said look down
[1:30:41] and when I took my when I took one of my
[1:30:43] four steps I stepped on a huge rattle
[1:30:46] snake and it was like about maybe about
[1:30:48] six seven feet long so when I stepped on
[1:30:51] it it was dead thank God so when I
[1:30:55] backed up I kind of like observed it and
[1:31:00] um found out that I think one of the
[1:31:02] hunt club members probably killed it a
[1:31:04] couple days prior so I took my knife out
[1:31:07] cut his rattles off and it was like
[1:31:08] eight rattles so meaning that that was a
[1:31:11] old very old snake so the Lord told me
[1:31:14] that
[1:31:14] um you ask me to move and I'm
[1:31:18] moving maybe not in the way that you
[1:31:20] wanted me to move but
[1:31:22] you know it just always expect God to
[1:31:24] move in unexpected ways and I'm looking
[1:31:28] forward to 2024 God moving in my life
[1:31:32] maybe not like that but
[1:31:35] um um expecting great things amen amen

[1:39:44] Mercy for his grace for his kindness for
[1:39:47] his longsuffering just for salvation I
[1:39:50] thank him for his death on calvary's
[1:39:53] Cross I thank him because you know
[1:39:55] Salvation is something that we can't
[1:39:58] earn we're not good enough to get it
[1:40:00] there's nothing we can do to earn it we
[1:40:03] cannot work for it but it is a gift of
[1:40:06] God I thank him for the blood of Jesus
[1:40:09] Christ that washes away our sins that
[1:40:12] has washed away my sins I thank God just
[1:40:15] for all that he has done I thank him for
[1:40:17] through the year how he has blessed and
[1:40:20] I was a person who never got
[1:40:22] sick who was always well and I guess I
[1:40:26] kind of took a little bit of pride in
[1:40:27] that and then all of a sudden it's like
[1:40:30] Satan just started attacking my body it
[1:40:32] was this it was that it was some of
[1:40:35] everything but one thing that I found
[1:40:39] out is that God is faithful by his
[1:40:42] stripes we are healed by his stripes I
[1:40:45] stand here tonight to say that God's
[1:40:48] word is true that he is faithful that he
[1:40:52] will prove himself that he is who he is
[1:40:55] and as I was listening you know to the
[1:40:57] young people testify about college you
[1:41:00] know it kind of made me reminisce a
[1:41:02] little bit and I thought about it
[1:41:04] because you know when I was going to
[1:41:06] college that was when I really gave my
[1:41:08] life to Jesus Christ and at that
[1:41:10] particular time my family told me we
[1:41:13] don't want to go that way we don't want
[1:41:15] to choose you other way so you have to
[1:41:18] make a choice you either choose us or or
[1:41:21] you choose to serve the god that you're
[1:41:23] going to serve cuz we're not going to
[1:41:25] serve him but you know I got on my knees
[1:41:29] and I prayed and I said God you know I'm
[1:41:31] going to have to walk you know this road
[1:41:33] alone but one thing I found out is that
[1:41:35] I was never alone he proved he has
[1:41:38] proved himself faithful year after year
[1:41:42] after year after year and sometimes I
[1:41:45] look back and I look at the times that
[1:41:48] when I was in school that I didn't have
[1:41:50] a where to anywhere to go I didn't have
[1:41:52] any money anything but every time God
[1:41:56] provided every time he made a way there
[1:41:59] was always someone there to um provide
[1:42:03] you know what I needed and I found out
[1:42:05] that God is faithful he's a good God I
[1:42:07] just thank him for all that he has done
[1:42:10] Saints we serve a mighty God don't we
[1:42:13] amen I bless his name tonight and just
[1:42:16] continue to pray my strength in the
[1:42:19] Lord
[1:42:22] well I wasn't going to say anything
[1:42:24] tonight since I said something on Friday
[1:42:27] but I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:42:29] just bringing us through another year
[1:42:31] for just providing for my family and
[1:42:34] just being My All In All and I just pray
[1:42:37] going forward that he just continue to
[1:42:39] use me in a mighty way um I want to do
[1:42:41] more for his kingdom in 2024 and I just
[1:42:45] pray that he use me lead God and direct
[1:42:48] me I love God and I love all his people
[1:42:50] thank
[1:42:53] you I thank God for protecting me every
[1:42:56] day and I pray that he can help me to
[1:42:58] find a good college and to start my
[1:43:04] career I thank God for my family and for
[1:43:08] keeping me this
[1:43:09] year I thank God for my family and my
[1:43:14] friends and hope he bring me to another
[1:43:19] successful
[1:43:32] I thank God for my family and for
[1:43:35] protecting me this
[1:43:39] year I thank the Lord for bringing us
[1:43:42] through another year um this is my
[1:43:45] second year of teaching and I'm kind of
[1:43:49] trying to decide is that really what I
[1:43:51] want to do with my life at this point
[1:43:53] but I also remember that that's
[1:43:55] something I've always wanted to do and
[1:43:58] the Lord made a way that I did pass the
[1:44:01] test to be able to do what my heart
[1:44:04] desired so I'm just asking the Lord just
[1:44:07] to lead and guide me in that and just
[1:44:09] keep us through this another
[1:44:16] year Well I want to thank all my brother
[1:44:19] for Year brother Ernie and brother Carl

[1:54:23] that I felt come Lord was dealing with
[1:54:26] me with and asked asked a
[1:54:29] question asked a question um and I was
[1:54:32] thinking and praying about it and the
[1:54:34] Lord came down and said are you
[1:54:37] fulfilling your
[1:54:38] purpose and I said in this new year I
[1:54:41] said I want to take the time the Lord to
[1:54:43] make sure that even if I I know what you
[1:54:46] want me to do Lord how can I do your
[1:54:48] will better how can I go on and Lord do

[1:54:58] you to do more Lord I want to see you in
[1:55:00] a greater way in my life I said I can't
[1:55:03] speak for anybody else I said but that

[1:55:07] you Lord so the things that I need to do
[1:55:10] Lord I want to be a doer of your word
[1:55:12] not just a hearer I don't want to come
[1:55:14] to church and that's where I leave God I

[1:55:21] down on my knees and have that personal
[1:55:24] relationship with you that Lord you can

[1:55:34] day every day that I walk every day that
[1:55:36] I breathe Lord speak to me Lord I want
[1:55:39] to be in tune that I can hear what
[1:55:41] you're saying to me I said that's what I
[1:55:43] I want to be a doer of your word not
[1:55:45] just a hear Lord if you say go I want to
[1:55:48] go said the song writer said I'll go if
[1:55:50] I have to go all by myself and sometimes
[1:55:53] you have to go by yourself but then you
[1:55:55] say Lord Lead Me Guide Me all along the
[1:55:58] way Lord if you lead me I'll go wherever
[1:56:01] you may lead me Lord that's the way I
[1:56:03] want to go I said this year Lord I want
[1:56:05] you to Lead Me Lord I want you to guide
[1:56:08] me Lord I want to be a doer of your word
[1:56:10] not just a hear Lord I want to fulfill
[1:56:12] your purpose for my life and said that's
[1:56:15] all that matters when it comes down they
[1:56:17] said May the works that I've done speak
[1:56:19] for me said you may not know how much
[1:56:21] longer you got on this Earth You may not
[1:56:24] know how many more years you may get to
[1:56:26] see but may The Works that I done may
[1:56:28] they speak for me I said that these Lord
[1:56:31] I want to make sure that I'm doing your
[1:56:33] word if you say if you leave me Lord I
[1:56:36] want to make sure that I follow where
[1:56:37] you lead me to go Jesus even came to the
[1:56:40] point he said if this cup may pass but
[1:56:42] then he said Lord not my will but thy
[1:56:44] will be done says sometimes thy will be
[1:56:47] done may be a hard path may maybe going
[1:56:50] through some things that you didn't
[1:56:52] think you wanted to go through or you
[1:56:54] didn't foresee that you would go through
[1:56:56] but it said when he say thy will be done
[1:56:58] God will take you where you need to go
[1:57:00] God will take you and make you realize
[1:57:03] things that you never knew that you had
[1:57:04] in you that sometimes he got to bring
[1:57:06] out so that you can fix him and that he
[1:57:09] can work in you further say Lord I want
[1:57:12] that you may do this work inside of me
[1:57:14] said Lord I want to see you moving each
[1:57:16] and every day I don't want to go a day
[1:57:19] pass and I see the Lord do something for
[1:57:22] me I said Lord I want to go grow so
[1:57:24] closer to you that Lord when you speak
[1:57:26] and I read your word that I can be a
[1:57:28] doer of your word not just a hear and I
[1:57:31] was thinking I said Lord that that's you
[1:57:33] said may not make a resolution but
[1:57:35] that's my goal that's my goal is Lord to
[1:57:38] see you moving to see you moving
[1:57:40] everywhere I turn Lord I Want Your
[1:57:42] Presence to be with me that when I walk
[1:57:45] in the room that people know it's not me
[1:57:47] but it's the one that sent me it's the
[1:57:49] one one that that made me the one that
[1:57:51] created me gave me life health and
[1:57:52] strength the one that's there and will
[1:57:54] always be there cuz he said I'll never
[1:57:56] leave you nor I'll forsake you see
[1:57:58] that's the God that I serve and if he's
[1:58:01] the God that I serve and he's the god
[1:58:03] that said he'd always be with me so when
[1:58:05] I look over and I see things and maybe
[1:58:07] going through a test or a trial cuz this
[1:58:09] year I said everyone can attested you go
[1:58:12] through some ups and some Downs some
[1:58:15] hills and some valleys and some things
[1:58:17] where I found out this year there's some
[1:58:20] times where they say that people may
[1:58:21] talk about you I had that happen I had
[1:58:24] some people do some things in school
[1:58:27] that I thought I'd never I never
[1:58:29] experienced that but God brought me
[1:58:32] through that and I looked back and I
[1:58:34] said well if he if he's already done
[1:58:36] this even though the test may get harder
[1:58:39] he's the same God he's the same God that
[1:58:41] can bring you through and when you get
[1:58:43] done with it you can only say that was a
[1:58:45] testimony I can go and encourage
[1:58:48] somebody else that people make talk
[1:58:49] about you but God will work it out in
[1:58:51] the end people may go behind your back
[1:58:54] but God will work it out in the end you
[1:58:56] don't even have to go and defend
[1:58:58] yourself God will take other people to
[1:59:00] defend you for defend for you and I said
[1:59:04] that's the God that I serve said Lord I
[1:59:06] want to be a doer of your word and not
[1:59:09] just a hear and then this new year I
[1:59:11] said Lord we I think everyone Lord we
[1:59:14] want to see you work Lord we want to
[1:59:16] grow closer to you cuz we might not have
[1:59:18] that much more time
[1:59:20] when we look at the world and we see
[1:59:21] what's going on in the world and rumors
[1:59:23] of wars and Wars are breaking out you
[1:59:25] don't know if the economy is stable
[1:59:27] tomorrow or not all it takes is someone
[1:59:30] to do something out of the ordinary and
[1:59:32] that's it what you what your normal is
[1:59:35] no longer normal everything that you
[1:59:37] thought you would be able to do you may
[1:59:39] not be able to do but God is the god
[1:59:41] that said I I will provide for you he
[1:59:44] said I'll heal you I'll move things and
[1:59:46] you can ask what you will and I will do
[1:59:48] it and I said said sometimes you got to
[1:59:50] stand on and say as the sister said many
[1:59:53] people have said tonight you just got to
[1:59:54] believe God that's it you got to trust
[1:59:57] him and believe that Lord you said I
[2:00:00] asked you said ask and it shall be given
[2:00:04] and that's that's why I'm standing you
[2:00:06] said Lord I believe and I'm not wavering
[2:00:08] on this Lord I'm not leaving to Lord I
[2:00:11] know that you going to do it Lord I'm
[2:00:13] standing right here and I'm not moving
[2:00:16] cuz Lord I know that you will do it cuz
[2:00:18] you're the god that I serve and you said
[2:00:20] that your word can't come back to your
[2:00:22] Void and so you gave me this word that I
[2:00:24] can use it you gave it to me that Lord
[2:00:27] that I can go out and I can defeat the
[2:00:29] Devil I can go out and I can speak
[2:00:31] things and they shall return I can go
[2:00:33] claim things cuz you told me to claim
[2:00:35] them I wouldn't be able to do it if you
[2:00:37] didn't tell me to but since you told me
[2:00:39] to Lord I'm going to use it I'm going to
[2:00:41] use this word that you gave me come on
[2:00:43] use the things that you gave me Lord cuz
[2:00:46] this is the weapon that I need to defeat
[2:00:47] the Devil this is is the only weapon
[2:00:50] that I need to defeat him and if the
[2:00:52] devil is he's already defeated cuz you
[2:00:54] already did that 2,000 years ago and God
[2:00:57] you defeated I'm so all I got to do is
[2:00:59] walk in Victory I ain't even got to
[2:01:01] worry about him coming against me cuz I
[2:01:03] know that he's defeated he ain't nothing
[2:01:05] but a bluff so if he come at me I can
[2:01:08] walk go on and say Lord you already did
[2:01:10] this I ain't got to Struggle No More
[2:01:13] Lord I ain't got to worry about this no
[2:01:14] more Lord you took care of this and I
[2:01:17] ain't got to worry about it coming back
[2:01:18] at me cuz when you said that you throw
[2:01:21] it all into the sea of forgiveness and I
[2:01:23] know that you do a mighty and a
[2:01:25] wonderful work and I said Lord I I'm
[2:01:27] looking forward to what you going to do
[2:01:30] I'm looking forward for God moving in my
[2:01:33] life I'm looking forward to God moving

[2:01:38] moved I'm looking forward to see God
[2:01:41] redeeming people and looking forward to
[2:01:43] hearing the testimony of how God went as
[2:01:46] the brother said and he brought him out
[2:01:48] and he delivered and he set free and he
[2:01:50] did a mighty work not because of
[2:01:52] anything we may do but because God is
[2:01:54] God and he changes not and he'll do
[2:01:57] exactly what he said do
[2:02:00] [Applause]
[2:02:02] [Music]

[2:02:29] you for taking me through another year
[2:02:32] you got a chance to tell him how much
[2:02:33] you appreciate him doing that so I'm
[2:02:36] going to read the scriptures I want to
[2:02:39] ask brother the M the ministers to get
[2:02:43] ready deck Walker and come with them and
[2:02:47] get ready for the communion tonight
[2:02:49] tonight the 1 Corinthians 11 and
[2:02:56] 23 it says for I have received of the
[2:02:59] Lord
[2:03:01] also for I have received of the Lord
[2:03:05] that which also I delivered unto you
[2:03:09] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:03:12] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:03:17] when he had given thanks he break it and
[2:03:20] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:03:25] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:03:28] me and after the same manner also he
[2:03:31] took the cup and when he had sck saying
[2:03:36] this cup is the New Testament in my
[2:03:38] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[2:03:41] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[2:03:46] ye eat this bread and drink this
[2:03:51] cup ye do show the Lord's death till he
[2:03:56] come
[2:03:57] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:04:02] and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy
[2:04:06] shall be guilty of the body and the
[2:04:10] blood of the
[2:04:11] Lord but he says here but let a man
[2:04:15] examine himself and so let him eat that
[2:04:18] bread bread and drank of that
[2:04:23] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:04:26] unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:04:29] to himself not Discerning the
[2:04:32] what see it's very
[2:04:35] important that we take
[2:04:38] communion but it's very important that
[2:04:41] we take it
[2:04:43] worthy see we're identifying with his
[2:04:46] death and his barrier
[2:04:51] and we want to identify with
[2:04:53] him in that we have taken on a Christian
[2:04:58] Life by the grace of God that this is
[2:05:00] the life that I chose to live so I want
[2:05:03] to have when I take it I don't want to
[2:05:06] just take it and like people
[2:05:08] traditionally just take communion and
[2:05:11] they don't have
[2:05:13] no sense of Anam in themselves and see
[2:05:17] whether I'm taking it Worthy I'm taking
[2:05:19] it
[2:05:20] unworthy so by the grace of God we take
[2:05:23] it and we want to take it
[2:05:26] worthy people they go out and party and
[2:05:29] do all kind of stuff and they come and
[2:05:32] take
[2:05:33] communion and that's
[2:05:36] wrong this is communion you have
[2:05:40] communion with him fellowship with Jesus
[2:05:44] Christ so by the grace of
[2:05:47] God
[2:05:49] it says for this cause many when they he
[2:05:54] says let me read the 29th verse again
[2:05:57] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[2:05:59] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[2:06:02] not Discerning the Lord's body 30 verse
[2:06:04] for this cause many are weak sickly
[2:06:09] among you and many
[2:06:12] sleep for if a man were judge for if we
[2:06:18] would judge ourselves we should not be
[2:06:21] condemned with we should not be judged
[2:06:23] excuse
[2:06:25] me but when we are judged we are chasen
[2:06:30] of the Lord that we should not be
[2:06:32] condemned with the world wherefore my
[2:06:35] brethren when you come together to eat
[2:06:38] ter one for another If any man hunger
[2:06:41] let him eat at home that ye come not
[2:06:43] together unto condemnation and the rest
[2:06:47] will I set in order when I come God
[2:06:50] bless you the reading of his word and
[2:06:52] we're going to ask everyone to just
[2:06:54] stand if they come and
[2:06:59] um sure you don't have another brother
[2:07:02] help you amen but we God is good
[2:07:06] amen we're going to get ready for the
[2:07:11] communion and I want you if the Bible
[2:07:14] says if we confess our faults he's
[2:07:17] faithful and justif forgive us of all
[2:07:19] our
[2:07:20] sins
[2:07:22] so together we want to go to the Lord in
[2:07:25] prayer as anything we've done said or
[2:07:28] thought is not pleasing in his sight
[2:07:31] want to ask God to forgive us that when
[2:07:33] we
[2:07:35] come with our hearts and Minds Lord I
