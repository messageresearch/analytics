[38:05] as we stand for the reading of the word
[38:07] the book of
[38:08] second timothy
[38:10] 1
[38:12] second timothy is kind of rebounded
[38:18] ii timothy 1
[38:25] and 6 it says wherefore i put thee in
[38:27] remembrance that thou
[38:29] stir up the gift of god which is
[38:33] in thee by the putting on of my hands
[38:38] for god has not given us the spirit of
[38:41] fear
[38:43] but of power
[38:45] and of love
[38:47] and of a sound mind
[38:51] be not down therefore ashamed of
[38:55] the testimony of the our lord
[38:58] not me his prisoner
[39:01] but be thou partakers of the affliction
[39:05] of the gospel
[39:06] according to the power of god
[39:09] who has saved us
[39:12] and called us with the holy calling
[39:16] not according to our works
[39:19] but according to his own purpose
[39:23] and grace
[39:25] which was given us in christ jesus
[39:28] before
[39:29] the world began
[39:31] but is now made manifested by the
[39:34] appearance of our savior jesus christ
[39:38] who has abolished death
[39:41] and has brought
[39:42] life and immortality to the light
[39:45] through the gospel
[39:47] god bless you read this word you may be
[39:49] seated
[39:54] we were dealing with quickly in power
[39:56] since
[39:58] uh
[39:59] around the easter time and
[40:01] we were continuing on
[40:04] death
[40:04] is defeated
[40:09] and then we
[40:12] your enemy is destroyed
[40:16] amen
[40:17] so this morning we're talking about
[40:22] death has been abolished
[40:26] he abolished
[40:28] death
[40:30] so why should we pay
[40:32] i mean put special emphasis on
[40:35] death has he has he has not he will do
[40:39] it he has abolished death
[40:43] are you with me
[40:45] that means something to you and i as
[40:47] believers
[40:49] the death has been
[40:51] abolished
[40:53] but to the unbelievable
[40:55] amen
[40:57] praise god
[40:59] they are still dead
[41:03] amen
[41:04] but to the believer
[41:07] death has been abolished
[41:11] in the that death has been abolished
[41:14] he says
[41:15] he brought life and immortality to light
[41:20] through the gospel
[41:25] and the bible says if our gospel will be
[41:27] heard it is hidden to them that are lost
[41:30] on whom the god of this world has
[41:33] blinded the mind of them that believe
[41:35] not
[41:37] least the light
[41:38] of the glorious gospel of christ
[41:41] who is the image of god shall shine unto
[41:44] them
[41:45] praise god god wants to shine to
[41:48] somebody this morning
[41:51] amen god wants to sow somebody's delight
[41:55] praise god that's what the gospel
[41:56] brought life
[41:58] and immortality to the light
[42:01] praise god that you can live everybody
[42:04] you praise god nobody wants to die
[42:07] amen everybody wants to live
[42:10] because they
[42:11] value life
[42:14] praise god
[42:15] sometimes folks say well i just want to
[42:17] die
[42:18] but in reality
[42:20] amen they want to escape
[42:24] the bible says the corruption that is in
[42:26] the world amen
[42:29] it's not about dying it says
[42:31] they want to escape they want to rid
[42:34] themselves of
[42:35] what's going on in this world
[42:39] somebody says that
[42:43] death has become our friend
[42:47] to the believer amen death is a friend
[42:51] it's the gate by which
[42:53] we pass
[42:55] out of
[42:56] troublesome vexation of sinful world
[43:01] amen
[43:03] we've had this world is full of trouble
[43:07] a man that is born of a woman a few days
[43:09] and full of trouble
[43:11] trouble all around us amen can't get rid
[43:14] of trouble
[43:16] but death is
[43:18] a gateway
[43:20] amen that we can pass
[43:24] amen
[43:26] to that place
[43:29] of the sixth dimension
[43:32] amen
[43:33] we don't die we go into
[43:36] a better place
[43:39] it's talked about
[43:41] into a world of perfect peace
[43:45] and purity
[43:50] and the powers they all were broken for
[43:53] death
[43:54] does not trump over us but we drop over
[43:57] it
[44:00] amen
[44:02] death does not trump over us but we
[44:04] trump over
[44:06] it are you with me
[44:09] so it's very important that we
[44:11] understand that god
[44:13] amen puts us in position that we can be
[44:16] uh
[44:18] victorious
[44:20] amen that death does not
[44:22] make us afraid
[44:25] we're not scared
[44:27] amen it's only
[44:29] amen our friend to take us where we want
[44:31] to go
[44:33] into that place where god says i've
[44:35] prepared a place for you
[44:38] the way i am that you may be also
[44:41] amen this troubled world and folks are
[44:44] they men are unhappy they're not happy
[44:47] they they living but
[44:49] it's almost like they don't know why
[44:51] they exist
[44:53] why am i here why you know in some folks
[44:56] it's not taking advantage of god's grace
[44:59] and god's mercy because they don't want
[45:01] their eyes to be open they don't know
[45:04] why should my eyes be open i i i think
[45:06] sometimes the christian
[45:09] amen sometimes there's a stumbling block
[45:11] in front of the unbeliever because they
