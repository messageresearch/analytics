[34:19] 17.
[34:28] First Kings 17.
[34:36] we got to say man
[34:38] and it reads and Elijah the Tish bite
[34:42] who was of the inhabitants of Gilead
[34:44] said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel
[34:49] liveth before whom I stand there shall
[34:52] not be due nor Reign these years but
[34:55] according to my word may God of the
[34:56] bless the reading of his word may be
[34:58] seated
[34:59] want to go a little further down
[35:01] here to
[35:03] we'll start here at the eighth verse and
[35:07] the word of the Lord
[35:09] came on came unto him saying arise get
[35:13] thee to zero seraphim which belongeth to
[35:16] zidan and dwell there behold I have
[35:18] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[35:21] thee so he arose and went to Zara Zara
[35:24] and when he came to the gate of the city
[35:27] Behold a widow woman was there Gathering
[35:30] of stakes and he called her and said
[35:33] fetch me I pray be a little water in a
[35:37] vessel that I may drink and she was
[35:39] going to fetch it he called and as she
[35:42] was going to fetch it he called to her
[35:44] and said bring me I pray thee and morsel
[35:47] of bread in thy hand and she said as the
[35:50] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[35:53] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[35:55] little oil in a cruise and behold I am
[35:58] Gathering two sticks that I may go and
[36:01] dress it for me and my son and they and
[36:05] that we may eat it and die and Elijah
[36:07] said unto her fear not go and do as thou
[36:10] has said but make me thereof a little
[36:12] cake first and bring it unto me and
[36:15] after mate for thee and for thy son and
[36:18] for thus saith the Lord a god of Israel
[36:20] the barrel of meals shall not waste
[36:22] neither shall the crews have all fell
[36:25] until the day that the Lord sinneth rain
[36:27] upon the Earth and she went and did
[36:30] according to the saying of Elijah and
[36:33] she and her house did eat many days and
[36:36] the barrel of meal wasted not neither
[36:38] did the crews have all fell according to
[36:41] the word of the Lord which he spake by
[36:43] Elijah let me God bless the reading of
[36:46] his word again tonight by the grace of
[36:48] God just for a moment I want to I want
[36:51] to talk to you just for a moment just on
[36:53] a little
[36:54] something that the Lord put on my heart
[36:56] and I've ministered on it about a week
[36:58] ago but I I entitled it you know what is
[37:01] Faith and will you trust God Amen
[37:05] what is Faith and and will you trust God
[37:07] you know I was at thinking once the
[37:11] scripture came to me about casting your
[37:14] bread upon the Water you know in
[37:15] Ecclesiastes 11 and and you know he's
[37:18] talking about casting your bread upon
[37:20] the water and it'll return to you says
[37:22] you know when I was thinking about that
[37:24] and thinking about you know I was just
[37:26] started looking at that and just just
[37:28] start thinking about you know giving you
[37:30] know without worrying about how you're
[37:32] going to get it back or given without
[37:34] worrying about the gain you're going to
[37:36] get from it because you know when when
[37:39] you give and you can't beat God's given
[37:42] you know I thought about you know start
[37:45] thinking about some things and that's
[37:46] you know like I said we was looking at
[37:48] this and and will you trust God and what
[37:51] is Faith and you know I began to look at
[37:54] sometimes you know what faith is you
[37:56] know faith faith stands alone
[37:59] Faith stands alone by itself
[38:02] they don't need no no help from anybody
[38:05] right or faith doesn't need the five
[38:08] senses to see it or to uh uh feel it or
[38:12] any of those things because it's not
[38:14] governed by that realm but what faith is
[38:16] Faith is a revelation
[38:18] faith is something that God you know
[38:20] reveals to you by his spirit and and you
[38:24] know you you count it like it says
[38:25] Abraham believed God and he counted you
[38:28] know those things that were not as
[38:30] though they were right it was it was
[38:32] counted to him for righteousness he
[38:33] called those things as though not that
[38:35] we're not as though they were because
[38:37] Faith had revealed it to him that no
[38:40] matter you know and as I said it stands
[38:42] alone it stood alone even with what his
[38:45] body was saying it rejected what his
[38:47] body was saying it rejected you know
[38:50] Faith rejected what his body was saying
[38:52] what the situation looked like Faith
[38:54] rejected all of that because it didn't
[38:56] recognize nothing but what what the
[38:59] voice of God had told him you know you
[39:01] know the Bible says faith cometh by
[39:03] hearing and hearing the word you know
[39:05] hearing isn't what isn't what uh makes
[39:08] produce I mean makes the faith but
[39:11] hearing it it produces you hear the word
[39:13] of God and then something inside of you
[39:16] just says I believe that
[39:18] you know I heard the word and and
[39:21] something's just just clicks in you you
[39:24] know that's why it's always good to read
[39:25] the words you know many times trials
[39:28] storms or something that might have come
[39:30] in your life and all of a sudden like we
[39:32] said a scripture come the word of God
[39:34] will come to you and then it comes so
[39:36] clear but what it is and then you you
[39:39] look at that whole situation and God
[39:42] gave you a scripture God gave you
[39:43] something to uh uh and what it did you
[39:46] know that it produced a faith in in you
[39:49] and then you said though everything else
[39:51] was was totally against it you know the
[39:54] God give you faith and your faith
[39:56] rejected it your faith rejected all of
[39:59] that and it held on to what the word of
[40:01] God Is So I said I said what is Faith
[40:04] come on so you know we're looking we're
[40:06] looking at a lot of things I said Faith
[40:07] stands alone you know it's God revealing
[40:09] to you you know I was thinking about you
[40:11] know what is Faith I said Faith looks at
[40:14] hopeless cases
[40:18] and they don't even worry about the hope
[40:20] faith looks at hopeless cases
[40:24] and it knows that what the word of God
[40:26] said about those hopeless cases
[40:28] you know I was saying that God
[40:30] Specializes in things that man can't do
[40:33] faith faith what is faith faith looks at
[40:35] hopeless cases
[40:37] Faith looks at hard situations you know
[40:41] they got these little videos Mission
[40:42] Impossible Faith looks at The Impossible
[40:45] don't it
[40:46] Faith looks Faith goes beyond you know
[40:49] they can only dream of fairy tale things
[40:51] like that but Faith brings those things
[40:53] to you to reality
[40:55] even though everything says no faith
[40:58] faith looks at at hopeless hard cases
[41:02] right Faith looks at Lazarus being dead
[41:05] in this great in the Tomb for four days
[41:08] stinking already right
[41:10] but what did Faith do it brought him out
[41:13] didn't it you know even even though when
[41:16] Jesus came and and they were saying he's
[41:18] dead and all they still had to have
[41:20] faith to roll away the stone didn't they
[41:22] come on they still had to somebody still
[41:24] had to go and move that stone away to
[41:26] just take God at his word and sometimes
[41:29] that's what it is I look at it I says
[41:31] Lord what is Faith you know what I'm
[41:34] gonna roll away the stone
[41:36] God Jesus is here see the thing is when
[41:39] we're looking at our own ability that's
[41:41] when we we the situation looks worse the
[41:44] situation looks hopeless the situation
[41:46] looks bad when we're looking at our own
[41:48] ability but when we get away from that
[41:51] when we start thinking or start looking
[41:54] at it as it's not my ability anyhow
[41:57] it ain't what I can do but it's what God
[41:59] can do
[42:01] and there's nothing there's nothing too
[42:03] hard for the Lord there's nothing
[42:04] impossible there's nothing too hard for
[42:06] the Lord and that's more than something
[42:08] that we just jump and Shout about
[42:11] but that's something that we look at
[42:13] from day to day we look at from
[42:15] situation to situation from trial to
[42:17] trial we look at that that ain't I was
[42:20] saying just something we shout about on
[42:21] Sunday morning but when we face those
[42:23] trials that's what we look at
[42:25] that God I believe that you're gonna
[42:28] you're gonna bring me out of this
[42:29] situation Lord I'm not looking at my own
[42:31] ability
[42:32] because my ability I'm already it
[42:35] already I can't do it already
[42:37] I'm I'm I can't make a way for myself I
[42:39] don't know already so I'm already failed
[42:42] uh you know looking at myself we like
[42:44] grasshoppers
[42:45] looking at ourselves it's all we already
[42:48] failures but what faith does we ain't
[42:51] looking at ourselves
[42:53] I couldn't save myself you couldn't save
[42:55] yourself but it was God that done it we
[42:58] look into a a what Christ did for us and
[43:02] that's what I'm standing firm on even
[43:04] here tonight that's what I'm standing
[43:06] firm on
[43:07] God it was you that saved me it was you
[43:10] that brought me it was you that kept me
[43:12] yesterday and I'm looking for you to
[43:14] keep me today and I'm looking for you to
[43:15] keep me tomorrow no matter what comes my
[43:18] way I didn't save myself God you saved
[43:21] me
[43:22] no matter what trial what no matter what
[43:24] come Faith stands alone you know David
[43:28] was in a rough situation one time and
[43:30] where their wives got taken and
[43:32] everybody was upset and they were talked
[43:35] about even stoning them but what he did
[43:37] the Bible I like how the Bible says but
[43:39] he encouraged himself in the Lord
[43:42] come on if nobody else ain't gonna go
[43:44] I'mma inquire of the Lord and if he tell
[43:47] me to go if nobody else don't go
[43:49] if God told me to go
[43:51] you know I like that about David he
[43:53] always brought the uniform and all that
[43:55] in in front of eford and all he would
[43:58] always inquire Lord should we go up
[44:00] and that's what he based it so if the
[44:02] Lord said go up you're going to Prevail
[44:04] then nothing couldn't stop him
[44:06] half of the army could have stayed
[44:08] behind but David was gonna go because
[44:10] God told him he said without surely
[44:13] without fail you're gonna you're gonna
[44:14] overcome
[44:16] on but if God told him don't go he
[44:18] didn't go but what it is no matter what
[44:20] you know when God says yes
[44:24] when when God gives you the okay or when
[44:27] God speaks nothing can't stop that
[44:31] nothing is nothing that could stand
[44:33] before that when God whatever God spoke
[44:35] his promises ain't nothing can stand
[44:37] before that and you start looking at
[44:39] that like Lord we are more than
[44:41] conquerors
[44:42] sicknesses trials all these things he
[44:45] said that with his stripes we are healed
[44:47] right he said I'm the Lord thy God that
[44:49] healeth all those disease he talked
[44:51] about you know I'll bring healing I'll
[44:53] bring it and the Cure come on but what
[44:56] it is you say what God got the cure for
[44:59] every disease
[45:01] every sickness all of them God got the
[45:04] cure for every one of them what's the
[45:06] cure here's the word what's the cure he
[45:09] is the cure you know I was thinking
[45:11] about it I says that you know uh uh
[45:14] looking at some hard situations I said
[45:17] well you trust God I was looking at uh
[45:19] last week you're talking to some people
[45:21] at the job and one of the co-workers or
[45:24] son got killed you know and he was only
[45:26] 22 years old so it was a hard situation
[45:30] for her but I began to talk to her and I
[45:33] began to say you know don't let this
[45:35] situation break you
[45:36] she said Earnest it's real hard she got
[45:39] five other Sons let's say it's real hard
[45:40] she says real hard because he got killed
[45:43] and I could see the the the the hurt all
[45:47] over and all that but I told her I said
[45:49] you know even in all of this it's still
[45:52] healing there and I thought about you
[45:54] know the Lord was dealing with me on a
[45:56] little sermon the healer is here
[45:59] in that hurt in that pain even in in
[46:03] your worst hurt and your worst pain the
[46:06] healer is here
[46:08] he knows how to heal those wounds those
[46:11] those cuts those scars those those deep
[46:14] slashes because you know the devil do
[46:16] that wounds you in the place you know
[46:18] the Bible said a wound the spirit is
[46:20] hard to Bear the devil got a way of
[46:22] doing that don't he putting you know
[46:24] weights on you wound Ninja
[46:27] hurting you so bad the way you can't you
[46:31] don't have the joy no more
[46:33] you can't smile it's hard to get up in
[46:36] the morning
[46:37] even it's hard to get out the bed
[46:39] because of the hurt and the pain
[46:41] but the healer is here
[46:43] the healer is here to heal all wounds
[46:46] he said the spirit of the Lord is upon
[46:48] me because he has anointed me to preach
[46:51] the gospel come on
[46:52] preach Deliverance to the captives
[46:54] Hallelujah you know what I say is that
[46:57] the Healer I start thinking about the
[46:59] healer is here I start I start thinking
[47:01] about that little scripture to cast all
[47:03] your cares upon the Lord because he care
[47:05] for you I started thinking about how he
[47:08] says come unto me all ye that are heavy
[47:10] laying with burden and I'll give you
[47:12] rest
[47:14] heavy Birds
[47:16] you know it's some heavy burdens out
[47:18] there ain't it I was telling them last
[47:20] night as my family I was saying you know
[47:23] sometimes you think you you you had it
[47:26] bad you had a bad situation you gotta
[47:28] you come out of something real bad or
[47:29] you had hard trials
[47:31] wait till you heard the next Man story
[47:34] it's always the next man's story then
[47:38] when you hear their story you start
[47:40] saying thank you Lord
[47:42] the little trials and you start calling
[47:44] them little trials and little situations
[47:46] because now when you heard the next Man
[47:49] story you can glory for the little
[47:51] trials and the little situation that you
[47:52] had because it could have been worse you
[47:55] know could have been way worse than what
[47:57] it is right now but God didn't suffer it
[48:00] to be so
[48:02] he know how much you can stand how much
[48:04] you can bear
[48:05] so he just let the little wind blow a
[48:07] little bit
[48:09] and he brought you out of it so I looked
[48:12] at that I says Lord you know I'm gonna
[48:15] trust you
[48:16] In This Storm imma trust you
[48:18] and the wind the rain I'm gonna trust
[48:21] you everybody turn around I say will you
[48:24] trust God I'm gonna trust you yes that's
[48:27] that's easy sometimes when everybody
[48:30] when family and everybody's going with
[48:32] you but if they turn around will you
[48:34] trust God
[48:35] come on let's talk to job about it
[48:37] job lost his children didn't he lost all
[48:40] his friends
[48:41] then even his wife came to him
[48:44] curse your guard and die but job did
[48:46] what he trusted God didn't he
[48:49] I said well you trust God I'll trust him
[48:51] when everybody else is gone
[48:55] when y'all when your pillar like I was
[48:57] saying the other week sometimes uh we
[49:00] got a crutch something to help hold us
[49:03] up but God gonna take away the crutch
[49:06] when he take away what's holding you up
[49:09] will you still trust God
[49:12] are you to the point in your life the
[49:14] way you say God I'ma love you no matter
[49:16] what I'ma serve you no matter what come
[49:19] today come tomorrow God I'ma trust you
[49:23] I know that this you know you look at
[49:25] lives you look at your own life you know
[49:28] the footsteps are the Righteous they're
[49:29] ordered by who by the Lord right
[49:32] so your path has already been cut out
[49:35] God is ordained you to walk that walk
[49:37] now some things we put on ourself but in
[49:41] a faithful in a righteous life God is
[49:44] our danger to walk that walk so when you
[49:46] on that Journey you know you're looking
[49:48] at that that Journey but you can say
[49:51] like David yeah though I walk through
[49:53] the valley in the shadow of death
[49:55] I don't fear no evil thou art with me I
[49:58] know that God your words is a lamp to my
[50:02] feet and light to my path this is my
[50:04] path and your word is leading me down
[50:07] this path
[50:08] your word is going to help me make it
[50:10] through this path hard cut paths you
[50:13] look at sometimes you might be on a
[50:15] trail or going out wherever and you come
[50:17] into some thick brushes
[50:19] so where you got to move back trees and
[50:21] you got to do all things to get through
[50:22] them sometimes you might want to turn
[50:24] around and go back but nevertheless your
[50:27] destination is on the other side
[50:29] I look at like Lord no matter what I got
[50:32] to go through the end of the story I
[50:34] want to hear you say Well done
[50:36] thy good and faithful servant I was
[50:38] riding on the road the other day and I
[50:40] was thinking no matter what happens in
[50:41] this life what you get what you don't
[50:43] get
[50:44] what comes and what don't happen
[50:47] what you don't achieve
[50:49] at the end of the story the greatest
[50:51] thing is to hear you got to hear them
[50:53] say Well done
[50:54] when you stand in there you got to say
[50:57] I'm hear him say enter into the joys of
[50:59] the Lord you've been faithful with the
[51:01] little you've been faithful come on now
[51:04] I'm Gonna Make You rule over man you
[51:05] gotta hear him say that that that's what
[51:08] matters God if I'm stripped of
[51:10] everything let me still have you Lord
[51:13] not just I have you but God you get you
[51:15] keep holding me
[51:17] and that's what you know that's what
[51:19] that anchoring is about in a time of
[51:22] Peace you know it's hard to get that
[51:24] anchor down on that rock when the storms
[51:27] and everything is tossing the boat's
[51:28] moving and oh it's hard to get anchored
[51:31] then but in the time of Peace that's
[51:33] when you anchor that ship you know that
[51:36] storm is coming so you make sure that
[51:38] anchor is down there you get down you
[51:40] get prayed up then hallelujah
[51:42] you get your breakthroughs then because
[51:44] it has come times where you can't pray
[51:46] like you ought to you can't break
[51:48] through like you ought to but in the
[51:50] time of Peace you got anchored
[51:52] so when the wind's blowing you say Lord
[51:54] I couldn't do uh what I wanted to today
[51:56] but that Anchor's down there something
[51:59] kept you and I know it was God I look up
[52:02] all the time I say God I know it was you
[52:04] I know it was him and you know what we
[52:08] ain't worthy majority of the time
[52:11] majority of the time we ain't worried
[52:13] that the grace of God we don't even
[52:15] deserve his Mercy but God is merciful
[52:19] you know the Bible talked about it he
[52:21] was rich in Mercy
[52:23] come on
[52:25] he was rich in Mercy I thank God because
[52:28] I said Lord we don't even deserve half
[52:30] of what you've done for us we don't
[52:31] deserve what you're doing for us right
[52:33] now we
[52:35] will Grace God
[52:37] come on
[52:38] but
[52:40] was to have fellowship with us for some
[52:43] reason God wanted fellowship with us I
[52:46] don't know why like they said he loved
[52:48] me but I'm so glad he did I don't know
[52:51] why God chose me but I'm glad he did
[52:53] Hallelujah
[52:55] by your own shoes and you wouldn't have
[52:58] chose God but God chose you
[53:00] and he drawn you with his love and
[53:03] kindness didn't he come on
[53:06] his loving kindness God draws you oh
[53:10] sometimes we have that pity partner
[53:12] those things for ourselves don't you
[53:13] know God draws you with love and
[53:15] kindness don't you know that the half
[53:18] ain't been told as rich as his glory
[53:20] Untold waiting on you
[53:22] come on we ain't doing these things but
[53:25] it's things waiting on you it's a rich
[53:27] is Untold waiting on you Hallelujah and
[53:30] I'm excited about it are you excited
[53:32] about it come on but I said will you
[53:34] trust God come on we know that you know
[53:37] in in this we all just read the
[53:39] scripture and how you know in that time
[53:42] they had it was a trust Factor wasn't it
[53:45] you know it had rained and and in a
[53:48] while and everything dried up and the
[53:51] first thing he asked her for was to get
[53:52] him some water right now you know it's a
[53:55] drop and even if we did have a water we
[53:58] ain't got but so much it ain't raining
[54:00] and no do but the first thing the
[54:03] prophet asked this woman for was water
[54:04] didn't he
[54:05] but you know what she was going to get
[54:07] it wasn't she
[54:09] you think about that she was going to
[54:11] get that water and then he says well you
[54:14] know bring me back a cake and all that
[54:16] but then she began to say okay you know
[54:19] I ain't got enough
[54:21] right it's already a drop she she ain't
[54:25] thought about it she going to get the
[54:26] water now you want the cake and all this
[54:28] she says you know she hadn't told them
[54:31] that she had done accepted death
[54:34] come on out the Gathering sticks the the
[54:38] way it was so such a desperate time that
[54:41] she had already accepted death didn't
[54:43] she
[54:44] because she was gathering together to
[54:46] eat her last meal think about that that
[54:50] was a bad situation wasn't it to know
[54:52] that you know but you know it comes to
[54:55] that way she don't accept it death
[54:58] because the situation was that hard you
[55:00] know the devil can put things on
[55:02] people's lives or situations can get so
[55:04] bad in your life to where you want to
[55:06] die to where you accept death to where
[55:08] you say oh I'm ready to go Hallelujah
[55:11] the situation got that hard Hallelujah
[55:15] but God shows up every time don't he
[55:19] God ain't gonna never leave his people
[55:21] David said I've never seen the righteous
[55:23] forsaken nor is he begging for bread God
[55:26] ain't gonna leave his people
[55:28] situation get hard and you look like
[55:30] you're done giving up or ready to give
[55:31] up then God shows up
[55:33] Hallelujah
[55:36] God shows up don't he
[55:39] we're a word he says but now that's what
[55:42] I want you to do
[55:43] he says you make me make me first you
[55:46] know
[55:47] and and you know I can see her maybe you
[55:51] know thinking of mine I just told them
[55:53] we gonna gather this together and die
[55:56] and now he want that right but thus said
[55:59] if the Lord came forth didn't it
[56:01] so even even in that she still had to
[56:04] trust God didn't she I said well you
[56:06] trust God God coming for your last
[56:10] you don't think God coming for the last
[56:11] God coming for the last
[56:14] somebody says we already going through
[56:16] and he coming for the last he's coming
[56:19] for everything
[56:20] he want to see how much you trust him
[56:23] he want to see that will you go all the
[56:25] way with them come on because he don't
[56:28] really need it he owned every cattle on
[56:30] the hill
[56:31] you know he's a Creator he can do all
[56:33] things but he want to see if you're
[56:35] going to be faithful with the looter
[56:36] that he gave you
[56:38] come on
[56:39] sometimes you know looking at money and
[56:42] things all the times which is true but
[56:44] you know sometimes you're looking at
[56:46] your life your time your willingness
[56:49] your pressing I say as you know it's
[56:51] something about that faithfulness God
[56:54] wants you to be faithful
[56:56] you know I was thinking I said you know
[56:58] you're you're his bride come on you're
[57:01] Lamb's wife
[57:02] right
[57:04] and in relationships
[57:06] faithful mean faithfulness is a whole
[57:08] lot ain't it
[57:10] come on
[57:11] it hurts your heart find out the one
[57:13] you're in a relationship with ain't
[57:15] faithful
[57:16] going out running with another man or
[57:18] another woman
[57:20] that hurt real bad won't it

[58:14] him but then he said Lord not my will
[58:16] but let thy will be done he pressed for
[58:19] you and I didn't he because he know that
[58:21] if he didn't press we wouldn't be saved
[58:23] today all the goodness uh and the
[58:26] kindness that God has shown towards us
[58:28] wouldn't be here today come on that
[58:30] bridge wouldn't be Gap the way we can

[59:34] that didn't he you say well they had
[59:37] nothing to do with us if God wouldn't
[59:39] have had his mercy and Grace around you
[59:40] Woulda if the angels of God if the hand
[59:43] of God wouldn't have been on you would

[1:01:21] you serving
[1:01:23] you know that every time God's children
[1:01:26] was put in a hopeless situation
[1:01:28] or dire distress
[1:01:31] or desperation God came on the scene you

[1:01:37] word you know that just by looking back
[1:01:39] over your life you know that that God he
[1:01:42] never failed he always showed up didn't
[1:01:44] he all I got to do is stay faithful come
[1:01:47] on and stay the course
[1:01:49] God don't show up and take care of this
[1:01:52] situation I believe it come on no matter
[1:01:56] what it is I begin to uh and the guy was
[1:01:59] saying that and I you know I was able to
[1:02:01] help him out with his air conditioner
[1:02:03] but other little question problems he
[1:02:05] had but I said that's the thing about it
[1:02:07] when you like that

[1:02:11] help you and that's God
[1:02:14] because man I can help you
[1:02:17] through the grace of God with certain
[1:02:18] situations for this other situations

[1:02:48] he specializes in those hopeless
[1:02:50] situations them hopeless cases come on I
[1:02:52] said God coming for your last you gonna
[1:02:55] give him your last she had a decision to
[1:02:57] make didn't she but yet she still
[1:02:59] trusted God didn't I say well you trust
[1:03:01] God I don't know about you but I'ma
[1:03:03] trust him
[1:03:04] you know when she trusted God he never
[1:03:06] failed or did he come on you know Faith
[1:03:10] Like I said stands alone and they had to
[1:03:12] see it but something must have revealed
[1:03:14] to her that what thus saith the Lord was
[1:03:16] it was going to come to pass
[1:03:18] come on I had accepted death but I ain't
[1:03:21] got to die no more because the hill is
[1:03:24] here I had accepted my sickness but I
[1:03:27] ain't got to be sick no more
[1:03:29] because the hill is here I had accepted
[1:03:32] my situation
[1:03:34] but I ain't accepting it no more why
[1:03:36] because God is here now the healer is
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:40] I will wound it
[1:03:43] but the Healer here
[1:03:44] I got my joy back now come on I could

[1:04:02] start having church again they were they
[1:04:05] look like they was feeling good in those
[1:04:06] videos but you know what it is
[1:04:09] something about it I said will you trust
[1:04:12] God come on you know most of the time we
[1:04:14] Bound By by the situations and things
[1:04:17] that's going on in our life
[1:04:18] you know they dictate whether you're
[1:04:20] happy or not they dictate whether you

[1:04:37] that none of those all these things like
[1:04:40] I said it's a beating it's a path that
[1:04:41] God got you on when you realize that God
[1:04:44] is in control I was sharing that with a
[1:04:46] few people last week I was saying you
[1:04:48] know God is in control
[1:04:51] of every situation
[1:04:53] they was telling me about situations I
[1:04:55] said God is in control of every
[1:04:56] situation

[1:05:12] that stood up on that boat one night and
[1:05:14] said peace be still that's the same God
[1:05:16] if he had control of the wind and the
[1:05:18] storms back then what about now
[1:05:21] come on he didn't change and none of his
[1:05:23] power none of his statue did he he's the
[1:05:27] same yesterday to Dance Forever God is
[1:05:29] in control
[1:05:31] somebody's saying about this situation
[1:05:33] whatever I said yeah God isn't God is in
[1:05:35] control of that
[1:05:36] you just trust God I say well you trust
[1:05:39] him or will you draw back you know you

[1:05:44] rewarding drawing back
[1:05:46] no reward
[1:05:48] if the situation only get worse
[1:05:51] come on but if you trust God you say
[1:05:54] Lord come on that lady said if I could
[1:05:57] touch but the Hem of His Garment
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:00] I've been sick all this time spent all
[1:06:02] my money don't got no more money I could
[1:06:04] just accept it stay like this but she
[1:06:07] says that it was a crowd around him but
[1:06:09] I'm impressed if I can I believe if I
[1:06:11] can just touch to him
[1:06:13] something happened to me if I can get to
[1:06:16] him I I believe it
[1:06:18] come on
[1:06:19] and that's what it is even blind barter
[1:06:22] males they said don't cry cry the
[1:06:23] loudest crowd louder didn't he come on
[1:06:26] even out of all of that God heard them
[1:06:29] didn't it and what it is here's that
[1:06:32] Faith cry
[1:06:33] it was it was a cry that man that that
[1:06:36] normal I would say man can't produce
[1:06:40] that crime
[1:06:42] but
[1:06:43] the situation to stress the trial
[1:06:45] brought it on didn't it
[1:06:48] but that cry God heard it I love when
[1:06:51] God shows up
[1:06:52] I love when God shows up
[1:06:55] and you say Lord God tell you I know
[1:06:58] you've been you've been fighting all
[1:07:00] night I know you've been bottling I
[1:07:02] heard you the first day you was praying
[1:07:04] I was there the first night the first
[1:07:06] night the womb came I was still there I
[1:07:08] ain't left you because I promise you
[1:07:10] I'll never leave you nor forsake you but
[1:07:12] I'll be with you even then that's my
[1:07:13] word that's what I said I ain't went
[1:07:15] back on my word
[1:07:16] I was there the first night that you
[1:07:18] that you was in pain I was there that
[1:07:20] night
[1:07:21] and I was there like like that little
[1:07:24] song it's been a long journey and Jesus
[1:07:26] has been right here by my side he ain't
[1:07:28] left you he still he and then he shows
[1:07:31] up he says you know but what it did it
[1:07:33] brought care Dodge
[1:07:34] it brought patience out you it brought
[1:07:37] long suffers out you've grown now
[1:07:39] Hallelujah you learn how to trust and
[1:07:42] depend on Jesus
[1:07:44] you learned that you didn't just know
[1:07:47] that overnight or you heard somebody
[1:07:48] talking about that but God taught you
[1:07:50] that he taught you that if you hold out
[1:07:53] you'll be stronger in the morning he
[1:07:55] taught you that we couldn't do it for a
[1:07:57] night he taught you those things we
[1:07:59] quoted scriptures as a child but God
[1:08:01] tortured him didn't he through the
[1:08:04] trials of life God taught you what he
[1:08:06] meant by that right and you learned that
[1:08:10] if I can just keep it in God's hand
[1:08:13] if I can I just gonna trust in Jesus and
[1:08:17] I know that everything gonna work out it
[1:08:19] always has and it always will
[1:08:22] Hallelujah even in depth of the workout
[1:08:24] why
[1:08:26] because you've been born again you can't
[1:08:28] die Hallelujah go in the ground that's
[1:08:31] just the body of shell but you're going
[1:08:33] into your new body he says a new body
[1:08:35] I've prepared for you right
[1:08:37] at my father's house there are many
[1:08:39] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:08:41] told you come on and I believed that
[1:08:45] Hallelujah so when you come to that
[1:08:47] conclusion that not even death can stop
[1:08:49] you Hallelujah not even not even those
[1:08:52] things it's just helping you get the way
[1:08:55] you're going at and I'm trusting God God
[1:08:58] I'm gonna trust you with my life I'm
[1:09:00] gonna trust you with everything I got
[1:09:02] I'm gonna trust God I said will you
[1:09:04] trust God tonight
[1:09:06] come on I love the Lord I said God I'm
[1:09:10] gonna trust you you know and that's what
[1:09:12] it is we got we got to learn you don't
[1:09:15] want to belong tonight but we got to
[1:09:16] learn to trust God I thought about so
[1:09:18] many so many uh examples in the Bible
[1:09:22] and I said God coming for your last
[1:09:25] when God Isaac finally came God came for
[1:09:28] him didn't he
[1:09:29] didn't he
[1:09:30] see if we gonna give it up will you
[1:09:32] trust God but it's something about
[1:09:34] Abraham he was just he was trusting God
[1:09:35] wasn't he he told them he said you stay
[1:09:38] here me and the lad go on the sacrifice
[1:09:40] and we'll return right
[1:09:42] but his trust was there come on he
[1:09:45] trusted God you know sometimes we got
[1:09:47] trust issues don't we
[1:09:49] because so many times people let you
[1:09:51] down people ain't come through so you
[1:09:53] don't trust nobody
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] but it ain't a time that God ever ever
[1:09:57] promised that he ain't come through
[1:09:59] oh he wasn't there unless it was
[1:10:02] something you know you and I done maybe
[1:10:04] the hinder the move of God but other
[1:10:06] than that God God never failed he always
[1:10:10] did what he promised he'll do he always
[1:10:12] showed up come on but yet a lot of times
[1:10:15] we got trust issues but what God does
[1:10:18] what God does he lets it all fail you
[1:10:21] till you have no other choice but to
[1:10:23] trust him you have no other choice but
[1:10:25] to look to him
[1:10:26] come on
[1:10:28] then he shows up but what is he doing
[1:10:30] all that for to build your trust up
[1:10:33] you know I like how when when when Moses
[1:10:36] died and God told you know he brought
[1:10:39] him out to the land but before they went
[1:10:41] into the land you know God took Moses
[1:10:43] away that Mighty leader didn't he
[1:10:45] took him away looked like you know the
[1:10:47] mighty leader that brought us out now we
[1:10:49] got to go into land without him
[1:10:52] but nevertheless God wanted to build
[1:10:54] trust in them didn't he he told Joshua
[1:10:57] we know what the whole thing of what
[1:10:58] happened and how he he disobeyed God and
[1:11:01] I smote The Rock instead of uh speaking
[1:11:04] to it and all we know that but I'm just
[1:11:05] saying it looks something how you know
[1:11:07] what could have might have been on the
[1:11:08] people's heart that Moses led us all the
[1:11:10] way now we're here and what happens
[1:11:13] God shows God takes Moses off to see him
[1:11:16] come on but nevertheless I like how God
[1:11:19] told Joshua as I was with Moses
[1:11:22] come on
[1:11:23] I want you to trust me as I was with
[1:11:26] Moses so I'ma be with you I want failure
[1:11:28] nor forsake you come on he says but I
[1:11:31] want you to keep my word and he said it
[1:11:33] won't be an enemy that'll be able to
[1:11:35] stand before you our father be an enemy
[1:11:37] to your enemy I'll fight all your
[1:11:38] battles for you come on in every place
[1:11:41] that your foot touch it'll be yours as I
[1:11:44] was with Moses I'm Gonna Be With You
[1:11:46] come on but I want you to trust me you
[1:11:49] got to trust me
[1:11:51] come on you got to trust and believe
[1:11:54] that I'm gonna do what I said come on
[1:11:57] I wanna I wanna bring that trust to you
[1:12:00] I say well you trust God come on as I
[1:12:02] was with Moses he said I'll be with you
[1:12:03] that same way come on and even here
[1:12:05] tonight come on God don't got no respect
[1:12:08] to persons does he come on God hears
[1:12:12] that little one don't it God hears that
[1:12:14] little one God's here God hears that
[1:12:16] little one prayer and he comes to the
[1:12:18] rescue God hears that one nobody can
[1:12:20] remember their name prayer and he comes
[1:12:22] to the rescue God hears that one crying
[1:12:25] out and about because they can't even
[1:12:27] make it to the house of the Lord down
[1:12:29] Sick everybody forgot about him but the
[1:12:31] Lord hears them and he goes by and sees
[1:12:33] about them don't he
[1:12:34] Hallelujah I'm so glad he does that I'm
[1:12:38] so glad because sometimes people don't
[1:12:40] know what you're dealing with what
[1:12:41] you're facing with but God does and he
[1:12:42] shows up don't he you know that's one
[1:12:45] thing when the Lord first saved me and I
[1:12:47] was I got a lot of alone time and you
[1:12:50] know just being by myself but the Lord
[1:12:52] showed me that he's a friend to the
[1:12:53] friendless
[1:12:54] he shows me that's where you built that
[1:12:57] real relationship with God because what
[1:13:00] you normally would talk to your friends
[1:13:01] and your mom and dad and everybody else
[1:13:03] about now you on your knees talking to
[1:13:05] God about because nobody's there nobody
[1:13:07] there to hear about will hear but God
[1:13:09] always got an ear and you you learn to
[1:13:12] just talk it over with Jesus talk it
[1:13:14] over with God and then what it is God
[1:13:16] you know start answering your prayer God
[1:13:18] start moving he speak back to you it's
[1:13:21] just you and God come on develop I mean
[1:13:24] building that relationship
[1:13:25] come on God taking you into that place
[1:13:28] to trust then you know you start that
[1:13:31] Journey with you and him alone
[1:13:33] so if everybody else walk away then it
[1:13:36] was just you and him that started the
[1:13:38] journey right
[1:13:39] and I'm glad I'm glad of that that God
[1:13:42] does that I'm glad that God does that
[1:13:44] but I said will you trust God come on
[1:13:46] will you trust God tonight it don't
[1:13:48] matter uh you know whatever you're
[1:13:50] dealing with whatever situation where
[1:13:52] you trust God
[1:13:53] come on you know that work that they
[1:13:56] asked me to hang a light
[1:13:59] and I didn't hang that light
[1:14:01] I'm thinking to myself well it's real
[1:14:04] simple 30 minutes at the most I was at
[1:14:07] 12 o'clock man I hung that light and
[1:14:10] knocked out the lights in the court of
[1:14:12] the building
[1:14:13] I was like what in the world
[1:14:16] I couldn't understand it a simple
[1:14:19] single phase light brother Gerald LED
[1:14:22] knocked out a whole bunch of Lights in
[1:14:25] the building
[1:14:26] everybody come out the office in the
[1:14:28] office too yeah they covered office what
[1:14:30] what
[1:14:31] so I'm looking at it like I don't know
[1:14:36] I said maybe a break I see she listened
[1:14:39] to today
[1:14:40] I said maybe I'll break a trip we all
[1:14:43] over the place okay if I had to break a
[1:14:44] trip nowhere
[1:14:46] so I don't hook it we couldn't get them
[1:14:48] lights back over three hours that's the
[1:14:50] Lord knows so that the we had to make
[1:14:53] this matter to everybody out there he
[1:14:54] pulled off he found a receptacle in the
[1:14:57] ceiling
[1:14:58] with the wire nut burn up
[1:15:00] and we ain't even bother that
[1:15:03] so anyway we hooked it up and the lights
[1:15:04] and all come back on
[1:15:06] so I said okay
[1:15:08] so it's like Earnest you could probably
[1:15:10] hook it back in and I'll say hey messing
[1:15:12] with that circuit no more
[1:15:14] we'll try another circuit
[1:15:16] I went and hooked that thing up it was
[1:15:18] like a Roman Candle shout out
[1:15:21] Sparks everywhere
[1:15:23] Ernest you all right
[1:15:25] I said something is wrong
[1:15:29] four o'clock I mean almost four o'clock
[1:15:31] I said something is wrong the man is
[1:15:34] better looking at me said cut it Earnest
[1:15:35] cut it because they wanted me to hang it
[1:15:37] up because somebody like to fell down
[1:15:39] the stairs so now they want us to light
[1:15:40] this whole area up right so like
[1:15:43] I'm looking at it
[1:15:45] and I had not ordered something from
[1:15:47] Subway at 12 30 and told you know be
[1:15:49] there ready at one Subway calling me to
[1:15:51] go pick the food up
[1:15:54] I had nothing to drink in about three
[1:15:55] hours because you know up in the ceiling
[1:15:57] I'm like
[1:15:58] I couldn't understand it
[1:16:00] so I told him I said you know what
[1:16:02] I don't know that's why I tell them I
[1:16:04] don't know
[1:16:05] but I said maybe because I was thinking
[1:16:07] I ain't gonna be the you know writer you
[1:16:09] know God showed you that that oh it's
[1:16:11] real simple hey simple no more
[1:16:15] it's supposed to work but it ain't
[1:16:16] working
[1:16:18] because you know everything is moving by
[1:16:21] the power of God later
[1:16:22] it supposed to work but it ain't working
[1:16:25] side side know what well I'll tell you
[1:16:27] what I'm gonna do
[1:16:29] because you know they want you to be
[1:16:31] there to get the lights back on
[1:16:33] I said I'm gonna cut this thing out and
[1:16:35] I'm gonna hook it all back up
[1:16:37] you know when they throw that switch so
[1:16:39] I don't know what else to do
[1:16:41] hooked it all back up the same way and
[1:16:43] cut it on and come right on
[1:16:46] and the maintenance matter said cut it
[1:16:48] off let's try it again cut it off cut it
[1:16:51] on it came right back on flip it on up
[1:16:53] down so I looked at him and I said I
[1:16:55] don't know
[1:16:56] I have no idea I said but I'm about to
[1:16:58] pack my tools up go home
[1:17:01] but it shows you then I says Lord I'm
[1:17:05] worn out and uh come on got home what at
[1:17:09] some time after six o'clock got home so
[1:17:13] washed up because I had already said I'm

[1:21:08] what brother Ernest was talking about
[1:21:11] I believe I've witnessed that a hundred
[1:21:13] times
[1:21:15] in maintenance
[1:21:17] and I prayed to the Lord
[1:21:20] with the job
[1:21:22] I said Lord it's got to be a demon
[1:21:25] because it never happened until church
[1:21:27] night
[1:21:29] wait a minute and it still happens now
[1:21:33] so I changed our night of church
[1:21:36] and help me follow Thursday night too it
[1:21:40] followed me to Thursday night
[1:21:41] it is the devil
[1:21:44] because it tries to hinder you
[1:21:46] but I appreciate the Lord tonight and my
[1:21:48] brother Ernest brought out I mean that
[1:21:51] same area
[1:21:52] but I'm preaching
[1:21:54] faith is our victory
[1:21:57] and if faith is our victory
[1:22:00] than to get Victory you must have an
[1:22:04] angel
[1:22:06] the angel told the prophet to be more
[1:22:09] sincere
[1:22:11] and that angel tonight is with you is
[1:22:15] ushering you into prayer
[1:22:18] to reinforce the holy spirit in your
[1:22:21] life that you can be more sincere
[1:22:24] because the Angel takes you through
[1:22:28] the sickness
[1:22:31] problems
[1:22:32] because it ushers you into praying
[1:22:36] and I told the church
[1:22:38] if you got a problem
[1:22:40] where's your angel
[1:22:43] the angel told the prophet
[1:22:46] go back and make it right
[1:22:48] you told your wife to tell him you
[1:22:50] wasn't here
[1:22:52] you can't pray for this little girl he
[1:22:55] made it right that angel told him to go
[1:22:57] back when he went to pray for the girl
[1:22:59] and he went back and made it right and
[1:23:01] then he went and prayed for we must have
[1:23:04] an angel
[1:23:06] so we don't miss prayer we don't miss
[1:23:08] reading our Bible
[1:23:10] faith is our Victory God bless you
