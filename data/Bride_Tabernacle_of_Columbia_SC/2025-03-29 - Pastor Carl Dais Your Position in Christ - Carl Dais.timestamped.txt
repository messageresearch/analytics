[38:52] Tate someone is reading your life am and
[38:56] they're seeing your actions and how you
[38:58] respond and how you act to a situation
[39:01] or condition and you say you're a
[39:03] Christian amen amen amen you say you
[39:06] love Jesus amen you say you are part of
[39:11] Christ amen but sometimes our actions
[39:14] are not Christlike amen sometimes our
[39:18] actions are the farthest away from
[39:21] Christ amen is it because of what we
[39:24] looking
[39:26] at as making us act the way we act or
[39:29] what see what you are feeding on tonight
[39:33] is part of the position that you in amen
[39:36] but we're preaching tonight your
[39:38] position in Christ amen or your hidden
[39:41] life with Christ oh we just going come
[39:44] to church and just sing a nice song and
[39:47] go out and not be a Christian are we
[39:49] going to live what we singing am are we
[39:52] going to preach what we're preaching we
[39:55] we're going to live what we preaching
[39:57] amen
[39:57] are we going to do what we want to do
[40:01] act like we want to act and don't know
[40:04] that you're
[40:05] Christian don't know that you've been
[40:07] deceived by the world
[40:10] Amen Colossians
[40:15] 3 sometimes when we praying we have to
[40:17] look back and ask God what is really
[40:20] going on with
[40:23] me because sometimes we don't even don't
[40:26] even understand the spirit that is on us
[40:28] and why we act like we act amen and
[40:32] sometimes our fellow sisters and
[40:33] brothers or parents can't even discern
[40:36] and tell us the way we act because
[40:38] they're
[40:39] afraid or whatever the situation may be
[40:42] they afraid to tell someone what is
[40:45] going on with them because you want them
[40:48] not to tear them down but you want them
[40:49] to grow in Christ growth I found out in
[40:53] Camp then you got to go
[40:55] down I found out en Camp when you
[40:58] growing you're going
[41:00] down people hate you people dislike
[41:04] you but when you going down see Jesus
[41:07] said I must go down that I might go up
[41:09] amen amen see in the garden he went down
[41:12] and when he was resurrect they set him
[41:14] God set him on the right hand of the
[41:16] Throne of God in the heavens so
[41:19] sometimes when we go down it means we
[41:21] going up amen so when someone comes to
[41:25] bring correction to you in love take the
[41:27] correction with love am Colossians 3 and
[41:31] one he says forgot my glasses tonight
[41:37] amen if ye then be risen with Christ
[41:40] seek those things which are where above
[41:44] above are we seeking those things which
[41:46] are above where Christ seek those things
[41:50] which are above where Christ sth on the
[41:52] right hand of God set your affections on
[41:56] things of above and not on things of the
[41:58] earth
[42:00] and on the earth for ye are dead and
[42:03] your life is hid with Christ in God so
[42:07] when you in your position your position
[42:11] it puts you into a place of
[42:14] death no matter how somebody treat you I
[42:17] was ministering on last night and this
[42:19] I'm almost about the middle of the
[42:20] sermon now but when you're in your
[42:23] position it means you are able to take
[42:26] whatever someone brings to you that's
[42:28] right Jesus was in his position not even
[42:32] just The Garden of Gethsemane but all
[42:34] through the books J Mark Matthew Mark
[42:37] Luke and John but Jesus was in his
[42:39] position and he could handle whatever
[42:42] condition faced him amen thank you
[42:45] Jesus Jesus said one place he said
[42:49] before Abraham was I am they begin to
[42:51] call him a born in fornication and all
[42:54] that he never got angry because he knew
[42:57] his position amen and tonight if you
[43:00] know your position in Christ then you
[43:03] can handle any and every position thing
[43:06] that happens to you amen but now let's
[43:09] look at a Christian in their position
[43:11] you're
[43:13] professional it means you read your
[43:14] Bible every
[43:16] day it means you pray every
[43:19] day if God would hold us accountable
[43:23] according to the law is 2 hours and 40
[43:26] minutes a day that you're supposed to be
[43:28] doing spiritual
[43:31] things see God by Sovereign Grace and
[43:35] Mercy said I'm going to put you in your
[43:37] position but it's going to be a little
[43:39] bit of suffering going along with it
[43:41] it's going to be a little bit of Trials
[43:42] going along with people going to
[43:44] ridicule you sometime they're going to
[43:46] talk about you and your children
[43:47] sometime but guess what you know you in
[43:50] your position so it's all
[43:52] right see you must see the spiritual
[43:55] application of your position to know
[43:57] that's part of your growth and it's
[44:00] going to continue to come until you
[44:03] recognize this is a test of the American
[44:07] broadcast system this is only a
[44:10] test and you must pass it it's going to
[44:14] come around over and over again glory to
[44:17] God you must pass it and I know tonight
[44:20] by God's grace uh God said the test is
[44:23] upon you young people old people middle
[44:26] a people God said your test that you're
[44:29] going through preacher it's going to
[44:30] continue to come and it's going to be
[44:32] more intensified until you pass it I
[44:36] said Lord in Wrath remember Mercy amen
[44:40] help me to get through the test that I
[44:42] can show forth the very grace and mercy
[44:46] of Jesus Christ that now I can be
[44:48] cemented in my position amen amen amen
[44:54] go ahead amen talking to a young man
[44:56] that did at the job
[44:58] Rob begin to tell him about hydraulic
[45:03] concrete we ordered some and supervisor
[45:06] on the job say order some concrete we
[45:08] got to fix some patches in the Basin
[45:12] that's full of water the hole is rounded
[45:16] out so he wanted me to explain to him
[45:19] hydraulic concrete epoxy how it
[45:22] works you can buy it in five gallons or
[45:24] three gallons or one gallon but when the
[45:27] concrete is to the point the anchor
[45:29] can't
[45:30] hold that's where the hydraulic concrete
[45:32] comes
[45:33] in some of them is only a minute set up
[45:37] time sometimes they get hard in the
[45:40] bucket before it sets up and it gets 400
[45:43] degre but the concrete is that you put
[45:47] it in the hole and you got one minute 5
[45:49] minutes or 10 minutes working time to
[45:51] push the anchor in and when that minute
[45:54] is up or 5 minutes up then you can apply
[45:59] pressure we in Satan Eden amen Leia the
[46:04] pressure is not going to stop it's going
[46:07] to intensify upon your life to prove
[46:10] what position you are at whether you are
[46:13] a true Christian or whether you just one
[46:15] of the ones that's on the side that love
[46:17] to go to the church uh you know sometime
[46:19] we got people love to go to the church
[46:21] uh some people love the pastor some
[46:23] people just love to be in the church uh
[46:25] they don't really want to be a Christian
[46:26] CHR it is in the church but with the
[46:29] ones that want to be a Christian thou
[46:31] the Christ the son of the Living God for
[46:34] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[46:35] me but my Father which is in heaven and
[46:37] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[46:41] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[46:42] against it you got to come correct and
[46:45] right say God in Wrath remember Mercy

[46:56] through it

[47:00] react accordingly according to
[47:03] the position that's in amen amen thank

[1:21:57] Lord if you didn't want us to be here we
[1:21:59] wouldn't be here but you've called us
[1:22:01] Almighty father even before the
[1:22:02] foundation of the world you knew we'd be
[1:22:05] sitting in the places where we are what
[1:22:06] we're thinking you knew everything that
[1:22:08] we were going to be thinking and you you
[1:22:10] knew what the brother was going to
[1:22:11] preach tonight Almighty father and that
[1:22:13] hidden life Almighty father you said
[1:22:15] greater is he that is in us than is he
[1:22:17] that's in the world and he as born of
[1:22:19] God overcometh the world so we consider
[1:22:22] ourselves Victorious tonight Lord

[1:22:26] were above us you with us but now you're
[1:22:28] in US Almighty father and you said that

[1:22:32] in darkness and said we walk in the
[1:22:34] light as you are in the light we have
[1:22:35] fellowship with one another and the
[1:22:36] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:22:38] all unrighteousness from all sin we
[1:22:41] thank you for the bleeding bloody word
[1:22:43] that you've sent in this hour to cleanse
[1:22:45] us and to prepare us for your coming
[1:22:46] Lord and as we leave this place Lord we
[1:22:49] ask that the angel of your presence
[1:22:51] would go with each and every one of us
