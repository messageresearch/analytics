help us God to move out of your way that your spirit might have the preeminence oh God that your name might be praised Lord we thank you father for we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look tonight for a moment at Romans 8 by the grace of God Romans 8 and we'll begin here at the 20 27 verse very familiar scriptures Romans 8 and 27. we gotta say man and it reads and he that searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called who are the called according to his purpose you may be seated we'll read a little further down for him for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amongst many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called then we also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God before us then who can be against us he that Spirit not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea brother that has that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also making intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or perilous reward as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter name and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord may God bless you reading of his word again tonight by the grace of God I just want to minister on the topic and I entitled it overcoming amen overcoming is very familiar scripture and this you know very beautiful reading there and just talking about the things and the trials of this life and and how you know I like how Paul began to talk about it he says that he says that in all these things we're still more than conquerors you know you begin to talk about that you know uh here in the in the 28th verse that we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God so many times we say that scripture as we're saying on Sunday that all things are going to work together but it's only going to work together to the good for those that love God and I said though you know do you love God tonight you gotta love them if you love them you'll keep his Commandments if you love God you'll do whatever God asks you to do and that's the thing about it says why isn't it working for me you know but he says that all things will work together for the good of them that love God and I believe that Paul here tonight was talking with her to Surety with a where the um you know with an assurity in his Christian walk because of that he can look back at all of the trials and the situations and his struggles and his battles and even in all those things he knew that he was still able to stand and all those things he hadn't lost his testimony he still was uh holding that same testimony from the very beginning because that's why he can say these things and all these things he says I'm persuaded that none of these things ain't gonna move me he says you know because we are more than conquerors and one thing that we have working on our side tonight I says that we got election working on our side election and is working by grace So I says that what it is you we we realize sometimes you know you can go through life and look at the things you achieved I made these achievements I've done this I've achieved that so you might be afraid sometimes that you know you see people that they work all their life and do things and then when their achievements seem to crumble right before the eyes they might commit suicide or they might jump off a building they don't have nothing to live for because all they ever work for crumbled right before their eyes all their achievements but it's something about being saved tonight I says that you know it ain't what I achieve but it's what God did for me is not that I could work enough to obtain the grace of God but it was through election that God gave us tonight the only way I can be here the only way you can be here tonight is through election and that's why Paul can stand there assured knowing telling the people that those who God called he said who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect for those that he called he already uh it says here he says he says for them who he foreknew he also predestinated to be formed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother and more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and then we in whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them also have glorified so you know from the very beginning it was already a finished work God foreknew you that's what that's what we come into reckon with and you know the devil don't want you to realize that he wants you to stay at a place the way you're always battling him you're always struggling you're always fighting within yourself but to come to the knowledge of it that I was foreknown of God come on God foreknew me and one day he he just called my my name and not in the spirit and I had no other choice but to come forth he says them before predestinated for a new he already predestinated he already called us he called us come on and as he called us he justified us you know the life that you live you couldn't help but live that life because that was the spirit that was in you but when God came along come on and he called you right then things begin to work and in your favor no matter what condition you're at place you're at when God began to call you things already begin working in your favor and then why because that election took over he called you he justifies you you came to that point you knew you were rotten and all you knew that you didn't have a right to even stand in the congregation of God with the children of God but when God calls you come on he justifies you he brought you to that place and where you couldn't hold your head up but when you did hold your head up you saw Calvary you saw it with God yes you couldn't make it yes you wouldn't you you so filthy that you can't stand in the presence of God you were born that way you come in the world that way but when God called you Hallelujah and he lifted up your heads and you saw Calvary you saw a bloody lamb you saw your sacrifice you saw your way of Escape that now when you stand before God you ain't standing alone but you're standing and he's looking at you not book or where your life is but he's looking at you through the blood that he shed for you come on the devil don't want you to think like that he don't want you to he he that's what it is he'll hold uh things over your head he'll hold you uh uh in bondage the way you can't be free to worship God the way you can't be free to to serve the Living God he hold things over your head hold things over you come on but God through the word tonight want to break those chains off of you he want to break that thing off you so you can be free to worship God it's they talk about the Caged Bird he got those wings but he can't fly they can give him all kind of nutritious meat and all those things or whatever they might give them but yet he's still a caged bird those wings ain't doing them no good but yet when if you open that cage and he's able to get out there and flap those wings and fly come on then he know that God gave him those wings for a reason come on they get out there and use them to reach Heights that some of the other animals can't reach go in the Realms that nobody else can't go into and that's what it is tonight the Holy Spirit I believe that wants to set you free don't want you to be caged up come on I know we're talking about denomination organization realm you know the the cage of every foul and unclean hateful bird we know that but then yet the devil can have you caged up here tonight cage it up in your mind cage up in your situation come on yet God has given you the word to strengthen you he's giving you something the spirit in this age the sore above to Fly Above All your trials Fly Above All these Earthly things and situations come on but yet you still sitting in the cage Hallelujah I said but God what I want to do Give Me Faith but step out of that cage Give Me Faith God to fly high into the heavens high above all these situations how many want that tonight but I says that what it is you know Paul here can say those things and and many times we look at uh the the Christian journey and many people you know they want to be labeled to overcome or labeled you know he always in each age he gave a salutation out to him that overcoming come on he said to him that overcometh so each age had something they had to overcome you I was saying the other day like what's it what's with being a warrior but that but don't want to fight want to be labeled a warrior but don't want to fight we want to be labeled uh Victorious but you don't you didn't have no battles I was saying that you know I always tell the children that I'm a I'm a war veteran I'm a combat veteran you know and it's the truth you know I says that because they told us when I was in the military 911 uh when it happened it was an attack on American Saul so we all got combat veteran status you know so I said I could say I'm Overcomer I'm a combat veteran but it ain't the same as I talked to somebody that been in World War II or being out there in Vietnam that ain't the same somebody say I'm a I'm a combat veteran and you get amongst those boys that really been through something you get amongst those people that really had to deal with something and you hear them stories about those bullets and how they said they hit off the wall and they said the movies uh play it this way and you hear like a a zip or whatever he said but it ain't like that they said you hear a quick crack he quick crack so that's what you're hearing and says that you get so used to the sound that every time you hear that crack you realize okay it didn't hit me so they got stories they got the Tails they got battles and struggles that they went through Hallelujah and they can say that we overcame now brother Ernest how did you overcome but I say it's what it is you want to be labeled a warrior a combat veteran but don't want to fight don't want to get into battles but I want to say it ain't so with all the soldiers that's in God's Army the soldiers that's in his army everybody got combat experience and if you ain't got none it's on the way Hallelujah All God's Children Hallelujah got battles that they've been through we look at those Heroes of Faith what did they go through some thrown here some thrown there all that women you know uh had their babies taken away from them all those uh uh ugly things that might have happened in their life but yet they went down as Heroes they went down as War veterans they went down as soldiers of the Cross Hallelujah they've been through something but I believe the Bible says that God ain't forgot about them they gave up this life that they might be able to receive a better Resurrection they knew that like like like uh Moses he chose rather to suffer in Affliction with the children of God rather to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he knew that it was a battlefield it wasn't a picnic he knew that he had to fight he had to go to war Hallelujah so he went didn't he come on and God ain't forgot about him they overcame I said and that's what it is we can have claims you know I says that you know we can have all those claims but it never had a never had a fight never had a real challenge it's a difference when you meet a real challenge you know you can fight all the time and nobody's on your level but when you meet a challenge that's what's going to bring out the worry in you that's going to bring out the weakness in you that's going to bring out uh uh the side of you that you didn't know that existed but you need that side to be brought out that way you can deal with it that's what these trials and these tribulations he says uh I'm persuaded and none of these things is going to separate us from the love of God come on God ain't gonna let you go all the way down he got you he gonna hold you come on but you got to realize that God is doing something in me God is doing something with my life yes it's gold but it's being tried right now in the fire but when it come out Hallelujah I like that song they say please be patient with me God ain't through with me yet but when God gets through with me imma come forth as pure gold and I want to say that tonight just as I ask you to be patient with me Hallelujah I'm gonna be patient with you because God ain't through what you get oh that excites me to know that even though God has brought us through many trials many mountains many valleys guarding through with us yet Hallelujah bigger Trials come bigger mountains come bigger situations come but God ain't through with us yet Hallelujah I like the other other week in the little bible study I've been stirred up and I was saying how you know Charlotte was bringing out that you know they talk about overcoming but it ain't how it ain't what you got to overcome as much as you got to look at how you're going to overcome it you know in each age they had to overcome but the devil will have you looking at what you got to overcome instead of remembering how you're gonna overcome it Hallelujah you know the devil will do that morning I think about those 10 spies when they went into the land they was looking at what they had to overcome didn't they instead of how they was going to overcome it but Joshua and Caleb had a different spirit they weren't looking at what they had to overcome because they already knew how they've been overcoming they know that they've been overcoming through the blood by the by the blood Hallelujah they know they've been Overcoming By that great Jehovah that same one that brought him out of Egypt Hallelujah it wasn't how it wasn't what they had to face with or what they had to deal with but they knew how they were going to handle it oh Jesus I said that stirred me in my spirit to know every situation it's a challenge Hallelujah I'm not worried about what I gotta face with those 10 spots worried about the Giants they in the land yes we're in our own eyes as grasshoppers before them worrying about what they had to face but forgetting how they been overcoming Joshua and Caleb knew that he said yeah he says our guard is able we're more than able because they knew how they were going to overcome it they knew they didn't get themselves there by coincidence about it fighting Hallelujah but it was by faith that they got there and it was by faith that they was going to get on Hallelujah and I say that tonight I believe that with all of my heart every situation no matter how minor how major I'm not looking at it I know how Hallelujah I thought about David he wasn't looking at Goliath what he had to overcome but he was looking at how he was going to overcome it Hallelujah God brought me through so many times I'm not worried about the life today because he'll be just as one of them well what you gonna do Hallelujah I'm gonna do what I always done I'm gonna put it in God's hand Hallelujah I'm a trusting God that's what I'm gonna do Hallelujah it worked in times past and it'll work now oh Jesus y'all believe that tonight come on if it worked then it'll work now he never failed me yet oh David now said we're going to give you the arm and the sword saw on David told him I didn't even prove these I don't know how to use them Hallelujah take them away from me what you gonna use I'm gonna use what's already been proven hallelujah oh Jesus and that's what it is come on and that's I'm gonna say tonight no matter how big the situation is now no matter what you face with the word Can it can handle it the word can handle it you know we're starting another week in how Jesus talked about how Jesus he hid behind the word because he was a word but he hid behind it every time the devil came at him he had the word he hid behind the word he wouldn't come from back though come on it's written it's written because the devil couldn't do nothing with the word could he don't you know the word is your fortification the word is your absolute come on the word don't you know that it'll defeat the devil on every hand come on every circumstance spirit of God coming coming down anointing the word no matter what what it is God can handle it all you got to do is stay behind there don't come from back there now stay back there and watch what God do I said the word the word a handle every situation Wanted let's look at let's look at uh By The Grace God Hebrews 12. God is so good amen overcoming Hebrews 12. Hallelujah I says that we got to overcome but don't don't worry about what you got to overcome just remember how you're gonna overcome it so I asked you tonight how are you gonna overcome it come on you know like I said you don't want to fight but the Bible says many other afflictions are the righteous right but God check on the shall deliver them from some of them right from all of them every one of them didn't have no stipulation nothing it you know God ain't Bound By no restrictions none he says that many are the afflictions are the Righteous but the Lord shall deliver him out of them all come on it's a finished work you in the battle but the battle is already won you already got victory as long as you now now the righteous you got to live right now come on I got to say that you got to live right come on be right with God and remember the battle already won and they always talk about you know Alexander the Great and how I love historical things and and how he always faced the challenge the enemy sometimes was five six times more than what he was but he would push his people he would always tell his army y'all we The Immortals you know we're going to be down in history they used to call themselves Lions going after you know but he would have them so charged up that they would run hedge Steam on in front of in the face of people that was five times they match but yet they would come out with the victory come on now we know he was anointed the taking that age to take over but nevertheless I think I believe that just looking at that I say it's what it is he had more than just a motivation motivational speech but when he spoke it did something to revive the people hallelujah to get them to believe in the impossible and they made the impossible possible by believing in it oh Jesus the other side didn't have that so I say tonight by the grace of God we got so many clouds of witnesses come on I said you got to believe to make the impossible possible he says if you only believe all things are possible you got to believe to make the impossible possible come on you're gonna need it one day you're gonna need God to be real one day you're gonna need more than just church one day more than just singing and good sermon you're gonna need it more than that one day but you're gonna need because we're saying the other other day you know people use the the Holy Ghost so loosely as a term they got the Holy Ghost but where's the power come on he says he gonna he says when you receive the Holy Ghost come on you shall be Witnesses of me talked about enduring you with power power come on maybe you say well just use it at your own disposal no but when the trial comes when the enemy comes in like a flood you watch that power what is it gonna do Elevate you from this carnal realm Elevate you from your situation your trial what you're going through watch the Power when the squeeze come watch the Power that's what we want Hallelujah y'all believe that tonight come on I say it's overcoming come on you know something I was looking at here in Hebrews 12. and here at the first verse it's saying wherefore we are in the first verse wherefore scene we also Compass about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that door is such a contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds I said we're overcoming tonight a lot of a lot of that overcoming is going to come about what are you looking to I said we got to look to Jesus for every situation every circumstance but it's one thing I want to read here in the it's an amplified version in the 12th verse I just want to read it he says the same scripture it says therefore then seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance unnecessary weight come on we got a lot of unnecessary stuff don't we a lot of things that come on us come on our lives and trial situation was unnecessary carrying around a lot of unnecessary weight come on he said but let us strip that aside throw off everything that's unnecessary come on he says and that sin was so readily definitely and clearly clings to an inner entangles us and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us looking away and I like how it says here in parentheses from all that will distract come on when you look into Jesus when you're talking about overcoming you look into him you got to look away from everything that'll distract you come on you know bad things happen when you get distracted I thought about Peter here when he was looking at Jesus he was all right wasn't he the wind and the waves and all that stuff was still bolstering it was still going on but he didn't see it did it because he was looking to Jesus but when he got distracted come on when he looked away from Jesus what happened bad things happen when you get distracted come on I said God don't distract us I mean don't let us be distracted don't let us be distracted not now Lord not in this hour that we live in where things are breaking every day happening we don't know what's going to happen next Lord don't let us be distracted if there's any time we need to look to you let us look to you right now because any time we want to be locked in focused with our mind set on our Eternal destination God let it be right now and sometimes you got to get down on your knees and pray that God will stir up something in you come on we sang that song take me back to that place where I first believed you got to pray and ask God to take you back to that place the way you first believed where you had no distractions when you throw it away everything that was unnecessary out of your way because you didn't want no distractions Hallelujah and you made a lot of ground didn't you come on he says that here it says looking away from all this that will distract to Jesus who is the leader and the source of our faith given the first incentive for our belief and is also its finisher bringing it to maturity and Perfection he for the joy of obtaining the prize that was set before him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now seated at the right hand of the Throne of God and it says here in the third verse just think of him who endured from Sinners such Grievous opposition and bitter hostility against himself wrecking up and considering it all in comparison with your trials he said I want you in Amplified version he's just talking here breaking it down he says now I want you to think of Jesus and all the trials that he'd been through no the hostility and the things he had to face he says I want you to think about it reckon it all count it all up he says now I want you to compare them with your trials compare them with what you face with Hallelujah and see if there's even a comparison come on he did that he went the distance he made the way Hallelujah now he's asking you and I to come that way but he wouldn't ask you to come that way if he wasn't able to take you that way he wasn't able to keep you that way he wasn't able to bring you all the way he wouldn't ask you to come that way would he he said so when you think about hallelujah what you going through think about what he went through and compare it to yours think about what he gave up and compare it to yours think about his suffering and the shame the Bible say he ignored the shame think about that and compare it to your trials once you begin to think about that then you don't have no struggle going on you don't have no struggle because Lord hallelujah you went through it you did it just for me and guard it you asking us to come that way and God I'm willing to come that way my body might not be willing but I'm willing the spirit is willing I'm willing to fight I'm willing to go on you know a lot of times people did things that their body wasn't capable of doing but the willingness come on they call it adrenaline though the willingness brought adrenaline things happen they can't explain how it happened Hallelujah but something was in them that Rush that gave them adrenaline to do things that were impossible to make it through situations through trials and all these things that everybody else died around them but they lived how did you live adrenaline that's what they'll say International right but the same way in the spirit Hallelujah people are dying spiritually speaking all around you right the world is only getting you know was in our studying that in this age there was nothing good said about this age nothing good God's so wicked God said I'm done with them he put him out his own church now what he's doing knocking at the heart of individuals If any man have an ear or hear me open up the door come on I'll come in I'll sup with him come on he that happened here let him hear God knocking at the door of your hearts I'm done with the church what he said come on I'm calling out individuals that's where my bride gonna come from that's why I'ma show myself alive and well in oh Jesus come on it's an individual Affair God Knocking at Your Heart Let God In Your Heart come on people are dying around you all around you spiritually and naturally fade and ought to sing well how are you making it adrenaline hallelujah how are you making it the Holy Ghost in you keeping you in you driving you pushing you Hallelujah making you go on a little further you know the thing is it says this world ain't getting no better it was nothing good said about this world this age it's only getting worse and worse and worse but as the spirit of God gets greater than you it caused more of a discuss it calls you a long and a more to be with your heavenly father a long and a more to please God come on those things aren't appealing to you and they don't please you why because you have another Spirit how many believe that tonight but he says that you know here and I like that he says uh in the compare them with yours so that you may now grow weary that you may not grow weary or exalted losing heart and relaxing and fainting in your Minds come on he says I want you to I want you to we're talking about overcoming tonight so like I said we're in a battle spiritual war we're in a fight tonight but still yet you know you got to overcome How You Gonna overcome you got to get in there and fight now but not looking at what you got to overcome but how you gonna overcome it how we being overcoming the Bible says you know we should overcome by the blood of the Lamb they overcame by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony come on how you gonna overcome it it's already a finished work but what I'm saying you know even in that you gotta you gotta get in there and fight you got to put it all in God's hands I can't express that enough that God can handle every situation yep he can handle every situation but we don't give them the situation to handle so how can he handle

to overcome come on how you gonna overcome tonight Paul said in all those things we are more than conquerors come on he said I'm persuaded it was no situation no trial whole world could have fell down on him but he knew that he was in God's hand and that's what I believe we come into even within ourselves the whole world crumbled right before you your whole world fall down I know I'm in God's hands
