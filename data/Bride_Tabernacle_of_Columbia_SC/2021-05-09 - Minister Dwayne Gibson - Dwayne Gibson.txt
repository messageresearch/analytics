turn up to the book of matthew the 13th chapter and praise god matthew 13 and 44. amen you got it we'll read again the kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hidden a field the witch when a man hath found he hideth and for joy they of goeth and sell it all that he has and by that field so he found something that was precious more prayer than what he possessed and he went and sold everything he had and brought that field again the kingdom of heaven is locked unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and saw all that he had and brought a hickory another somebody he's seeking for pearls he found one of great price he would have sold everything he had to get that one amen let us pray gracious kind heavenly father we have read your word now lord we ask you to bless it lord let it find its place in the hearts of your children we thank you for this day may you bless us in jesus christ's name amen may be seated amen we're going to talk about selling out for jesus selling out for jesus christ here god said the kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure god has to be treasured to you if god is not like treasure to you then you won't seek him or you won't give up things that you think is treasure for him god has to become treasure to you the kingdom of god must become more precious than anything you own or possess and you must be willing to sacrifice or to sell or give up off a sick everything you got in order to get into the kingdom of heaven that why we're here this morning because we want to get into what the kingdom of heaven we want to be where god is we want to be in that new heaven and that new earth that new jerusalem that's we want to be so god's kingdom is like somebody's seeking something seeking treasure seeking something better than what they already possess you're seeking something better than what you already possess in this life this life right here we might possess things but are not more precious than the kingdom of heaven the things that we possess now don't compare with the kingdom of heaven y'all hear that it don't compare so we seek him with something better than what we already possess and when we find that something we are willing to sacrifice or give up or sell everything we got in order to get there now if you got that kind of attitude i believe you'll find god you're willing to give up sell out everything that you possess now i think you got a hold of you willing to give it up in order to get to the kingdom of god a lot of people sad to say i'm not reached that point you're not ready to sell out everything they got in order to get to the kingdom of god but you this morning you want you have to be ready now to sell out everything in order to get to the kingdom of god here's old man he's seeking pearl you know pearls people love pearls women love pearls hey man something to wear on their finger around the neck anything but girly pearl he's seeking something here the bible says seek ye first what the kingdom of god so we seek in god's kingdom amen so the man he's seeking these pearls and he found one pearl of great price how many you know jesus christ is that pearl of great price i said the lord jesus is that pearl of great price you got to recognize that he is so great he nothing can replace him nothing can take his value nothing can be more important than him that was when he found the pearl of great price he went and saw all that he had everything he possessed everything he could think of he went and gathered together and sold it and got that pearl of great prophecy jesus christ is that pearl of great price you got to be willing now to sell out everything you got everything you possess in order to get this pearl amen the kingdom of god thank god for coming to church amen thank god for all that but have you sold out to jesus have you sold everything amen that you think is important amen in order to get jesus christ amen praise god those that truly are walking with god they have sold out everything in order to hold on to jesus christ that's what you can tell the difference in a in a life a man of perth and just coming to church and a person that really sold out for god because they have given up everything that they thought was precious in their life into that to the time when jesus came into their life amen somebody been going for basketball some of them going for football or somebody going to a big protection school or something but then jesus came i said then jesus came amen and they and jesus they were willing to give all that up in order to get christ so they sold out their dreams sold out their desires sold out what they wanted to be in order to grab a hold of jesus christ i wonder if somebody this morning wants to do that want to sell out your dreams set out your desires in order to grab ahold of jesus christ i never live in a world now where people think having a bunch of materialistic things is being a christian because they've got all the materialistic things in the world they think they're christian my materialistic things don't make you a christian having the best house or the best call or whatever that don't make you a christian what makes you a christian is that you soul out to jesus christ and you're walking in god's word and doing the will of god did y'all hear that see that what makes you a christian thank god for the blessing amen i don't serve him for the blessing he promised to bless me if i put him first see that's how blessings come it didn't come because i ran after him or you ran after him it came because you served the lord and gave yourself over to god and because you did that god began to bless you he began to multiply you begin to do things for you amen all because you sold out you sold out thank god those you ever sold out that you sold out you sold out to jesus not to a church not to a building but your soul out to who jesus christ you got to recognize who jesus christ is he is what the word of god manifest for our day not another day for this day so you sold out to the word of god you've got to be sellout in this generation you got to be sell out in this age everything is contrary to god and submit yourself to god to jesus christ who is the word that's right the word for our day manifest for this deal right here so these examples here people are seeking god they're seeking something better jesus said the kingdom of god is likened under treasure and when you really found jesus he is treasured to you you don't want to let him go here man oh he's like tragic to me i will not let him go i don't found a pearl of great price and it means more to me than anything i won't let it go see when you find jesus christ like the bible said then it become like a pearl a great prize or a great tragedy that you've been seeking you found this treasure and you will never let it go no matter what the world brings no matter what the world said no wonder what satan tried to offer you you then found this pearl of great price and you won't let it go hallelujah the world will try to steal it from you though the world is trying to steal and then you're the devil come to kill steal and destroy so the devil will try to steal it from you don't you let them steal it from you but you know i'm still how important jesus christ is to you he's important to you look look at your life before christ came into it and look at your life now would you rather do better hold on to god won't you rather sell out everything you've got in order to hold on to god you will hold on to him cause you realize how precious he is to who to you now he's not precious to everybody everybody don't value him like he should be valued i might heard that see some people place a value on jesus and the value that some people place on him is not a high value judas iscariot plays a value of what 30 pieces of silver he sold the lord out see you can sell out for jesus or you can sell jesus out judah sold him out for 30 pieces of silver that's all he valued him oh lord this morning is he worth more than that to you thirty pieces of silver judah sold him out he thought back then that was a lot of money i think some people figured it out and it comes into the millions of dollars but jesus christ is worth more than a million dollars how much do you value him to smile you willing to sell him out for 30 pieces of silver are you wanting to sell him out for that big time job that you got he's worth more that big-time job worth more than jesus no nothing is worth more than him so some people sell them out for a little bit of money they sell the very most important one out they can ever meet the most important one you can ever come in contact with they're willing to sell them out for a little bit of muscle meat don't you sell them out this morning you sell out instead of selling jesus out you sell out selling everything that's blocking you from getting to god come on somebody sell it out give it up let it go whatever it is that's stopping you from grabbing a holy jesus i say let it go sell it out this morning don't hold on to it what's holding you back sell it out so many people let things hold them back from grabbing a hold of god god's 10 years tomorrow you need to sell out sell out amen and give it all and give it to jesus amen praise god they'll go to the book of romans amen the seventh chapter amen so we're talking about selling out for jesus christ who is the word we selling out for who jesus christ we're willing to give him everything in order to grab ahold of him amen make let make him real in our life not just a story that we heard other men of god talk about but a reality in whose life my life the living god that we're talking about that can do them impossible that can do miracles that can bring things to pass that's the kind of god i serve that's the kind of god i worship i worship a god that's living not dead no dead god a lordship of a living god amen praise god this god we serve is real amen romans the seventh chapter amen he does miracles he performed america he just didn't be doing some miracles around here lately the doctor then gave up when our sister bearded god came by and worked a miracle i said god came by and worked a miracle come on somebody god came by when the doctor said it can't be done all god came by and work a miracle turn back the hands of science let science know that there's a greater god than sign there's a god almighty hallelujah yes sir god see you'll miss god don't miss him don't miss god passing by amen don't miss god passing by amen god will pass right by and you'll miss him because you're not looking for him the right way amen you'll find him in his word amen praise god romans the seventh chapter amen so you're doing miracles things that doctors say can't be done god come by and prove the doctors they're wrong and they when the falls they acknowledge and education can take them and that's the fault that could have went we got a guard to go higher than that hey man we got to go go higher than education education don't mean nothing to god god will take the simple to backward and unlearn and make them bring those thoughts confound the scholars didn't god do what the apostles me agreed in the bible they were in ignorant i learned men didn't know the abc but when they met christ there's a difference coming inside their life see so you don't have to be a scholar to know christ you can be just as simple as simple can be but god comes over hallelujah he come down with simplicity and he will reveal himself to you oh he come by in simplicity and will reveal himself to who do you don't you want to know him oh hell i want to know him let me come by and reveal himself to you in simplicity amen praise god that's what god does you need high up amen that they're making us so pompous and high that the bible say the common people hurt them gladly they make them so pumped and high even the common people can but god wants so simple even the children can understand it that's right either fools should not hear everything he wanted simple enough that children can understand they can understand that something more precious amen than uh whatever a car a house or is that more precious than a new pair of shoes there's something more precious amen the new clothes that's jesus christ you might talk and understand that there's something more precious than that see thank god you got him and your mom and daddy can afford it for you but it's something more precious than that that's jesus christ and that's what you want to get to i believe the most greatest gift you can give your mother on mother's day is to give yourself to jesus christ you'll take away a lot of her worries you'll take away a lot of her pains if these children are just getting themselves over to god did y'all hear me this morning then when you got saved your mom and daddy had some rest i don't mind dead when i got saved my mama had some rest god put that woman through some trouble but when god got a hold of me boy i was a blessing to my mother not only my mother my grandmother i became a blessing where i go god can't come and change my heart see these children don't understand that not yet but i pray god they do see when god get a hold of your heart you would oh you'll be the best child it can ever be you'll never give mom another heartache another pain you'll be there for mom and mom what can i do for you mama how can i help you might want me to do this for you see your heart been changed until that heart get changed that's not in your heart what's in your heart is what selfishness what i want what i can have what i can do but when god come he changed that heart it makes our hearts soft as you know you recognize now see your mother amen praise god yeah people don't do good to their mother with the one time a year to do good for their mother gonna be the devil the rest of the year [Music] no no no no but see you can't do that until god changed your heart when god's truly saved you you will be a blessing to your mother 365 days a year you'll be a blessing will cause no grief no heartache no pain you'll be a blessing to him oh hallelujah they love you and still the same don't get me wrong they still love you they don't care about my pain you call it it's to love you hallelujah praise god let me move on okay roman the seventh chapter amen praise god amen romans seven amen amen romans 7 and 14. amen now notice the bible takes us back here to the beginning it says we know where we are the lord's spiritual about him carnal soul under sin adam sold us out adam sold us out eve caused the problem but adam sold us out did y'all hear that his soul is out to what to sin the bible said a man was not in the transgression but the woman was in the transgression eve listened to the devil that's right she taught paul took out a fruit boy adam did adam came and sold us out by he partaken of the fruit so he sold us out adam could have stealed another side of the line but there's another type inside there that god was working that christ had to die to redeem his bride that's right the adam was filling two sides there but he sold us out to sin that's why we're in the shape we're in today because adam sold us out it's all about the sin but thanks be to god we got another adam that came and sold himself out amen he saw himself out to get us out of sin we can read that to you by the grace of god amen jesus christ sold himself out give him everything to come down do what redeem me and you he gave up his throne in glory come on somebody sold out everything he had he was the god of heaven but he came down the earth amen inside the form of a man amen the god into a form of a man came to redeem man but he had to give up everything first he had to sold it out he had to leave it behind and come down here for me and you thank god he did it amen so jesus adam sold us out put us all in the shape that the world is in today all because he took side with his wife but only then that's a type how jesus christ whose love for his bride came and give his life for the world that's right so adam sold us out to what sin sold us out look everything adam's sacrifice in the god in the garden of eden the beautiful garden that god created adam could have still been here today if he won the soldiers out he had the spoken word which was the original seed he could have that that power that god gave him to rule over the earth when he sold us out he gave up all that look look what he lost by selling us out look what you will lose if you sell jesus out you sell jesus out all the blessing that god has given you usually what you're going to lose them you don't want to lose your blessings do you all the things that god has given you and done for you through the years and you decide one one moment i'm going to just give it all i'ma sell it out to go do what i want to do don't you lose your hallelujah i don't want to lose the blessing that the lord has given me i want to hold on everything that god has blessed me with i want to lose nothing i'm going to hold on to it see adam lost everything y'all know how to have it in the garden of eden adam was blessed in the garden had everything the trees will be in the animals have been the window beam everything was under his control and dominion but when he sold us out he lost it all that way you can't sell jesus out because you'll lose everything amen praise god judah sold them out for 30 pieces of silver he thought he was gaining something but he lost everything the bible said he went and hung himself but it was too late to end see once you sell jesus out it's too late you knock them might gonna be able to get back let's read that let's go to matthew 27 chapter amen judah sold them out for 30 pieces of silver they sold joel's about for 20. they didn't realize that he was going to need joseph you see they didn't realize that he was going to need joseph but to that point right there joe didn't mean nothing to them number the dreamer that daddy loved more than them but they can't recognize that god was working through that young man see that they missed they missed the blessings of god because of jealousy how many people were jealous of somebody today because what god is doing for them how many were jealous of somebody that god is blessing and and they're jealous of me and want to separate themselves from or put them out the midst of whatever they did joseph they were jealous of joseph and so jewels about for how many 20 pieces of silver that wasn't a lot of money but look what they did they sold jewels about but guess what they didn't realize they're gonna need joseph you're gonna need christ don't you sell them out for the world you're going to need them now they did not realize how important joseph was to them until the time came that they really needed him they needed to go down to egypt and get food they didn't recognize who was down there but god had sent joseph down here to provide food for them amen they needed joseph oh hallelujah amen what i said uh um matthew 27 amen they saw joseph alpha 20 pieces of silver sold out the one the very one they needed the one that was going to be the blessing to them they sold them out see you don't want to sell christ out christ is your blessing amen don't sell them don't sell your blessing out hold on to god amen praise god and there's evil time we're living in hold on to the lord jesus don't sell them out for nothing the world got to offer you amen matthew 27 and 3 then judah went which had betrayed him when he had saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver uh to the chief priest and elder but it's too late now it's too late to try to turn you then sold him out he want to try to come and make repentance but the bible says he can't find none he can't find and then sold out christ and now he's trying to find some repentance saying i have sinned and that i betrayed the innocent blood lord remember those wicked people here now these are these are religious people these are church leaders they say what is that i see all of that they don't care nothing about jesus they don't care nothing about um about judas here all they wanted them to do is sell jesus out the devil don't care nothing about you you know okay now all they want you to do is sell jesus out once you don't sell jesus out he gonna show you a time he gonna put something on you with all he wants you to do first do what sell them out all they wanted judas to do is do what sell them out let them deal you deal with the rest of this that and get them we won't hear nothing about that you don't sold them out too we don't got them now and that's the end of it see that what the devil will do he'll trick you in your mind and in your spirit to make you think something is better than jesus the lord jesus christ and try to make you give that up for jesus christ and once you do that you then lost everything and you're gonna come down oh why did i do that it's too late that's why you don't sell him out he's that pearl of great price he's that treasure the more precious than anything can get in this world don't sell them out oh hallelujah see this it sold him out amen and you can't can find repentance it was too late it meant hebrews it meant the sixth chapter amen uh hebrews 12 y'all know the story he saw he sold out something see you can sell the wrong thing which is jesus christ you can't you can't sell any more precious than anything you got to hold on to them with everything you got in your bible say fight the good fight of what faith you had to fight to hold on to this gospel you have to fight to hold on to jesus christ you got to fight 50 grand again that's right you got to fight and have your fight you'll win fight fight to hold on to god fight to hold on to his word fight to do that which is right fight in jesus christ's name don't let the devil steal nothing from you amen praise god the devil come to kill steal and destroy you steal everything from me if you let him you got to fight amen praise god look at hebrews 12 or 16. you all know the story about uh esau he's our soldier's birthright you all know that he's our soldier's birthright he shouldn't have did that he despised the bible he despised his birthright the birthright is the firstborn get most of everything the line they call it the lion's share he's the lion everything the father got amen he got hungry one day and thought that i'm failing to do him no good and he sold it to jacob amen for a bowling of beans see that his birthright didn't mean nothing to him right then because he was hungry care how hungry you get you hold on to christ god he might let you get hungry but you hold on to christ he might let you get down

to god shout out to god this morning in jesus christ's name amen let's go to uh luke 18. luke 18. you all know the story amen he came here looking for eternal life he had the right motive and the right objective but he didn't want to go all the way a lot of people come to church with the right motive and the right objective but they don't want to go out all the way you got to be willing now to sacrifice now remember you got to sell out everything in order to grab ahold of jesus the lord jesus christ and here now this young this young man this young rich ruler came up to jesus a good master what shall i do thou may have eternal life jesus told me you know the commandments he said yeah i know him all them i didn't care for my youth i never ran around i never was smoking and drinking and stuff like that i kept my commandment i kept them amen jesus said one thing you're lacking go sell all you got see you gotta sell out go say all you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow me you can't do that see he can do everything else keep the commandment for that day see he was doing that what he was doing what he knew for that day but when jesus came it was a new day come on somebody it was a new day now you gotta do more than just keep the law now you've got to follow jesus christ you got to follow jesus christ now that what you was telling him you oh you didn't do again but one thing you're lacking you were doing good for your day you had moses damn you kept more than what moses said but now you're in a new day you're in a new era you're in a new time now you got to follow me you got to follow me now and if all of me you got to tell all you got take up your cross and follow me the bible said he went away sad that was a hard saying many young people today can't give up everything to follow jesus many old people can't give everything to follow jesus they can come to church and all that but when it comes down to selling out and giving over everything that would he lack you like that one thing sell all you got sell your desires sell your ambition sell it all off for who for jesus christ and give yourself over to the lord that young rich ruler the bible said went away sag the bible he had great possession only if you had that revelation that if you have sell all those things for god god would have given many times more than that back did the paul just say lord what shall we have sinned we have followed thee we left houses and mothers and fathers and land for thy sake jesus knows no man that left anything would not receive a hundred full mole in this life and in what the world will come so if you sell out for jesus don't worry about it he's gonna bless you with a hundred times more than what you give up that way you shouldn't be worrying about giving them nothing for jesus did you give it up for jesus he gonna bless you with more how many of y'all didn't experience that you didn't give up for jesus and god didn't bless you with more you gotta have more than ever had in all your life why could you give it up you sold it out for jesus and god doesn't bless you with mo all of jesus that caught that revelation he had caught it he would have not walked away and turned away eternal life but because then he lacked that revelation that god will bless you whatever you give up for god god gonna bless you but he didn't he didn't catch the revelation of it and therefore you went away sad went away sad all because he didn't realize that you give about anything for god god is gonna bless you with a hundred more he's gonna bless you you sacrifice for him he's gonna bless you amen praise god that rich young ruler amen he he he did not want to sell out everything see jesus told him to do what he told them sell all you got sell your riches sell your property sell your cars sell all your god then i'm going to give to the poor give them to them then i want you to take up the cross real quick and call your food sell all your stuff all your stuff you had you done selling stuff man something wrong dude you crazy people do call you that when you serve jesus y'all know that right when you give up your ambitions when you give your desire man you could have been a football player man you you you did what you turn on that scholarship and do what you come to church oh you fool a girl you you crazy they'll ridicule you make fun of you because of your sacrifice but don't you worry god god still bless you man he gonna take care of you so take up your what your cross you gotta cross you're gonna have to bear because of the world they're not gonna understand you no more once you start serving jesus christ they gonna thank you food but we are fools for christ amen they can thank you food they thank you crazy and everything around with you so that's your cross you take that crown you buried it man you take that ridicule you take that scone whatever they put on you but no no don't say man you got eternal life amen hallelujah so you got to take up your cross and when you do sell out for jesus people will be able to kill you they will talk about you especially the people in the world that had great aspirations for you to be somebody in life the one that had that great aspiration oh i just know this person they're gonna be somebody there'll be somebody good and all of a sudden they found you serving the lord and you didn't become that great person they thought you was going to be that girl then i thought i brought down through their life away look at them going to church wearing them long dresses and and and all kind of stuff like they jump through their life away looking ain't never become nothing i'm what god wants me to be i'd rather be that than anything else in the world i'd rather be with god want me to be in anything else inside the world oh five oh um is god bless them to do that amen yes so god that's our example for us amen that god blessed him he left all that he had amen to fall of god you have to be willing to do the same thing today young people over whoever we are our stage of life when god comes to us we must be willing and ready to forsake everything the follow jesus the lord jesus christ when he calls your name when he calls you you must be ready right then about the dead when you hear his voice harden up your heart if you hang the voice of god this morning sell out sell out for who jesus christ when he calls you if you know he called you know he talking to you this morning then you should not hold back you should sell out for jesus christ thank god for coming to church but it's a deeper walk with god come on somebody it's a deeper walk than just coming to church it's a deeper walk with god you got to be willing to sell out to get it though amen praise god look at paul the apostle particle the philippians the third chapter amen praise god paul had to sell out you know his life paul was a pharisee a pharisee of the pharisees brought up under gamaliel one of the greatest teachers of his day he had all kind of credentials that he can hold on to but he meant jesus amen i said he meant the lord jesus christ hallelujah that changed everything for paul you're willing to give it all up in order to get christ that's what we have to do today we have to be willing to give it all up in order to get who the lord jesus christ amen let's go to philippians the third chapter you got a man that has scholarship you got a man that had the uh the the degrees and everything amen and could have been a great man but god changed and made him grateful god see i'd rather be grateful god and grateful man amen praise god hallelujah amen look what it says right here paul says but what things let me start from the beginning listen say uh philippians 3 and 4 though i might have confidence in the flesh i mean the other man think that he had wherever he might trust in the flesh i most he is his upbringing and his uh how he was brought up he gave him confidence in the flesh because of what he had what he didn't experience he he then been taught under uh he was he was a hebrew uh he was a pharisee he i mean he was uh he was just doing some great things see so he can be he could have been walking around proud that i'm somebody look at me i'm somebody and he was doing that to god got a hold of him god did god get a hold of paul paul have been lost y'all hear that if god didn't get a hold of paul paul would have been lost religious but lost on fire but lost and because you're doing it the wrong way second side is there the stalk of israel the tribe of benjamin and he brought the hebrews touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the rising within the law blameless can touch paul but notice what they would gain to me those i kind of lost for who christ he wanted to give all of that for christ for fallen pharisees and those religious leaders they love paul oh paul they're down here and the corner having a meeting go get him paul over here over there go get him paul they're over there go get him lord have mercy he had his last go get him on the road to damascus he a letter from the chief priest to go down and arrest him but jesus arrested him [Laughter] jesus arrested paul hey man paul's i'm i'm i'm copy i'm apprehended of christ jesus god came and locked him up lord lock me up make me a prisoner come to y'all i want to be a prisoner who of christ lock me up do what you have to do just keep me in christ keep me locked up and cried paul was a prisoner he's i'm a prisoner of who jesus christ why but god came and apprehended him god came and locked him up from his purpose and what he wanted to do what the chief priests and pharisees had him doing god came and changed that and then god changed him over to his purpose no more paul saw but now i'm paul amen was there and we found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that was to the faith of christ the writings which is of god by faith notice amen 12th verse not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which i was also apprehended see jesus caught him didn't y'all want jesus to catch you this morning let jesus catch up your life will be a whole lot better let jesus lock you up let jesus apprehend you you know where apprehend got to do a law see when they apprehend they got a they got a suspect running loose they said we got to apprehend that suspect and lock him up see jesus had to apprehend paul and lord about he locked him up paul even realized he said see now i'm a prisoner i'm a prisoner of jesus christ i can't even do what i want to do no more amen i'm i'm locked up inside christ i'm locked up i can't even do what i want to do no more i'm just locked up amen praise god never you know whatever how prisoners are when you're in prison i work in prison system they're locked up they can't do what they want to do no more you want to go somewhere you got to get a key and let them out you can't go nowhere you want to exercise you got a certain time you do that too you can't do nothing you're locked up paul was locked up i cried the only thing he can do what the spirit told him to do that's right well god led him to do he was a prisoner of jesus christ locked up amen brother saying the bounds of love locked up in chains of love he fell in love with jesus didn't want to let loose oh lord i'm in love with jesus and i don't want to let loose i don't want to let loose this pearl a great price that i found i want to hold on to it for the rest of my days i fell in love with jesus and then fell in love with his grace and i fell in love with his mercy and i fell in love with him i want god mercy to leave me i think i want god mercy and grace to leave my life no sir i never fell in love with this thing this thing is good i wanted all the days of my life i love the lord amen i love his mercy i love his grace i love his loving kindness i love him because i know how good he is i never want to lose never want to let go i'm not going to sell it all because god has been too good to me and the lord is good to me i'm never going to let him go i'm never going to sell them out never going to do it in jesus christ's name not selling this the lord the lord is too good the bible tastes and see that the lord here is good all people must be in taste because the law truly is good amen praise god the lord is good amen praise god notice look at moses amen moses had to give up some stuff didn't he moses had to sell out they go to the book of hebrews the 11th chapter moses had to sell out the man that had everything till they met god that's all all about when you meet god you're willing to sell out everything when you find that pearl of great price that's god when you find that treasure that you've been searching for that's god and when you finally found it then you're willing to sell out everything else for that you got to be able to get there amen most uh hebrews the 11th chapter hallelujah hebrews 11 and 26 amen praise god amen esteeming the reproach that choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god and to enjoy the pledges of sin for a season moses by faith he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter see that was a lie they kept him in power pharaoh's wife found them you know they tried to first of all they tried to kill him that's right the whole scheme was to cast them into the knob for the crocodile to eat them but god got hold of moses mama and daddy and it had some faith bob's because they saw he was a proper child and they placed him inside a bull or a basket and put him into the nile and thanks be to god god let him all the way down to the king house ain't got good you ought to let no crocodiles eat him gonna let nothing happen to the basket god let him scream on down to pharaoh's house straight down to the affairs i fear had a barren daughter couldn't have no children she found this her nurse and somebody found this little um thing in the in in in the now and she takes this child and makes it her child she said this is my son i call his name moses but that wasn't her child more than kind of bothering he was come to years he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter see what he did he denounced all that riches he's done all that fame he's not all of that in order to get god see when he come to years he was being taught by the mother anyway her mother would let them know who he was your mother let you know who you are if you only listen y'all hear that children your mother let you know exactly who you are if you just listen she'd be trying to tell you every day who you are moses mama taught him who he was what his purpose was amen what god had him there for and he would come to years he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter he threw it away choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pledges of sin for how long a season might know some seasons are long some seasons are short but he refused it see he could have been then joined all the pledges of egypt but he turned it down he sold it all out for christ amen by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible now he watched the ten commandments didn't make you think more than was afraid but the bible said he wasn't afraid bibles he feared not he forsaken not fearing the wrath of the king we endured seeing him who was invisible that's god that's right he wanted to see god he wanted to see god see that some got inside moses he comes he came to years he been to cast off the stuff for the world you know egypt represents the world lost that's right he began to cast off the stuff of egypt cast it all off amen now he wants to do what seek god lord have mercy we are in our spiritual egypt we should be casting off the things of the world and begin to seek who god there's a spiritual egypt amen had us in bondage go ahead and come deliver us out that's right we're in the spiritual bond we didn't know it though we were in spiritual bondage and god sent a deliverer to get us out of his bondage we was in amen casting off the things to the world amen praise god mother to cast it all off amen why he want to see god amen praise god look at another scripture let's go to the book amen of tim ii thessalonians i hope you are here this morning somebody need to sell out maybe somebody needs they have not fully sold out to god they come to church to get church members people calling members now but whatever you got to be born inside the body of christ amen you good church members good church people that's good but you got to go further than that you got to celebrate everything for god amen you got to make a sacrifice in the name of the lord jesus amen uh 2 thessalonians 2 amen praise god hallelujah 2nd thessalonians 2 and 1. now we will see you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ by gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor but letter asked from us ask that the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they come what are falling away first so many people are already selling out we don't we know that for a fact but what's going on in this last days around this message that god has sent us many people have done this fall back so loud they sold out their faith sold out their first confession say we don't believe this mess no more they call it a mess but it's a blessing to me see the great fallen away has come people are falling away from what the word of god is selling out and what are they doing they're going back to the very same thing that god delivered them out of that was going to happen when you sell jesus out where can you go back backwards you can go back to doing the same thing you used to do you was in the screech you go back to the street you're in the club you're going back to the club you just smoke and drink you're going right back to smoking and drinking you can't go number two directions either forward or backwards god said go forward god wants you to go forward not back when then god told the children it will speak unto the children to do what they go forward see you don't want to go back but that's why in these last days once we see so much going on around us we see this great falling away that has come inside the church you want to not fall you don't you don't want to sell out you want to hold on to god not to a man i'm talking about the god we know that god is just what is his word he is the word made manifest for this day this word that we got to this day is right how many of those words write this that said the law that god has sent us in the last day how many i know this right is that said the lord see so you don't want to sell out and all the uh the the the false persuasions and everything else people trying to say and all the things you can read and people can talk about you want none of that to persuade you ought to change your mind you want to hold on to god with everything that's inside you in these last days don't sell out sell off for god but don't sell god out amen somebody this morning they want to come to the lord somebody this morning want to just come and say lord i need to sell out lord that was for me amen praise god i mean god is able to bless you i mean we got to be honest with ourselves see and god can help us god can bless us see we gotta sell out for jesus amen let us pray lord jesus we thank you this morning for your holy word thank you for the people that patiently listen to your word oh god in the last days law many are selling out lord the lord you said uh the kingdom of heaven lagging to a man lord seeking gilly pearls and lord he found that one pearl a great price and went and saw all that he had they may buy that one lord that would you all to us you'd a pearl of great price and we have sold out everything god in order to grab
