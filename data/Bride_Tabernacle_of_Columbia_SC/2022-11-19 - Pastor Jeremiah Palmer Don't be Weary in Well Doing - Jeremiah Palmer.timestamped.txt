[33:52] [Music]
[33:55] if you have your Bibles
[33:59] should turn with me to the book of
[34:06] the Galatians the sixth chapter
[34:23] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[34:32] Galatians 6
[34:36] 4 through 10.
[34:42] but let every man prove his own work
[34:45] and then shall he have rejoiced in
[34:48] himself alone
[34:51] and not in another
[34:53] where every man she'll bear his own
[34:55] burden
[34:57] let him that is taught in the word
[34:59] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[35:03] all good things
[35:06] be not deceived
[35:08] God is Not mocked
[35:11] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[35:15] he reap
[35:16] for he that soweth to his flesh
[35:19] shall reap
[35:22] shall his flesh reap corruption
[35:25] but he that saw it to the spirit
[35:28] shall of the spirit reap life
[35:31] Everlasting
[35:33] and let us be not weary in well-doing
[35:37] for in due season we shall reap if we
[35:42] think not
[35:43] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[35:47] do good unto all men especially until
[35:51] them who all are the household of faith
[35:54] let us pray
[35:56] father God we
[35:59] want to thank you tonight God for
[36:02] your mercy and your grace Lord
[36:05] God I pray God for your people Lord that
[36:08] you
[36:09] look upon every situation and condition
[36:12] Lord and
[36:13] God we know God that your word is true
[36:16] father
[36:18] and we are so grateful God for your
[36:20] promises in this hour that you're given
[36:22] to us
[36:23] Lord we are holding fast to these things
[36:27] oh God our faith is anchored Lord in the
[36:32] things that you have given to a
[36:33] Hallelujah
[36:35] in this hour
[36:37] Lord your precious promises in Jesus
[36:41] name amen may be seated
[36:55] I want to speak just to you a few
[36:59] minutes and not mean to be long tonight
[37:01] at all
[37:04] on a little thought of
[37:06] don't be weary in well-doing
[37:11] don't be weary
[37:13] in well doing
[37:17] the scripture says that if you sow to
[37:20] the flesh
[37:22] you'll reap corruption
[37:26] so everything that you and I do
[37:33] we want to do it as unto the Lord
[37:38] I always say it and telling the church
[37:40] back home whatever you do for God let it
[37:42] be real
[37:47] let it come from your heart that that's
[37:49] what you really want to do for God
[37:55] you know sometimes
[37:58] sometime you know I think about a pastor
[38:01] and the laboring
[38:03] some things that we'll never know that
[38:06] he does
[38:08] but I say God sees
[38:12] the labor
[38:14] the love
[38:17] the sacrifice
[38:20] that one makes
[38:22] sometimes never even known by
[38:25] people but God sees
[38:30] and I believe God is just
[38:33] the scripture said whatsoever a man so
[38:37] he will reap
[38:40] I believe if I remember correctly at the
[38:43] end of every Church Aid there was a
[38:45] reward
[38:47] for those that the scripture said in the
[38:49] end of it he had an ear let him hear
[38:52] what the spirit is saying to the
[38:54] churches
[38:57] and church I want to tell you tonight
[38:59] don't be weary
[39:03] of what you may be doing and not seeing
[39:06] by men
[39:09] I believe what you do when you don't
[39:11] people don't see it's a greater reward
[39:16] because only God knows the things that
[39:20] one does and he knows the purpose and
[39:23] the reason why one does it
[39:28] understand one thing is that you do it
[39:33] uh for the wrong reason no profiting
[39:36] that because that's you
[39:41] but when you do it out of an unselfish
[39:44] thank you selfish motives and uh it's
[39:50] not about you
[39:52] I believe the everything that God did he
[39:56] did it for us
[40:00] when he gave his life he he did it not
[40:04] for a selfish reason but he did it
[40:06] because he loved us
[40:11] and one of the reasons he did it to uh
[40:15] bring us back to him again
[40:19] to reconcile us back to himself because
[40:23] we were a part of him
[40:27] and now the servant of God savior you
[40:29] wasn't a prayer to God then you won't be
[40:31] a part of God now
[40:34] we understand that we have been chosen
[40:37] and predestinated by God for this hour
[40:40] right here
[40:43] and God has chosen us the Bible said he
[40:46] chose us and we didn't choose him
[40:49] we only accepted what he had done for us
[40:54] and when we heard that word what did it
[40:57] do it did something on the inside of us
[41:01] and not really even knowing what we were
[41:03] doing really
[41:05] but God knew
[41:07] what he was doing he was a reconciling
[41:10] his family back to him again
[41:15] I I think about those things uh I tell
[41:19] you what this is the only thing y'all
[41:21] know he missed it all the time but when
[41:23] I think about it it makes me want to
[41:25] shout
[41:27] because I know that
[41:30] um that I'm not even deservable of of
[41:34] what he has done for me
[41:37] all of us and our own should have been
[41:39] dead
[41:40] we should have been cut off and lost but
[41:43] but God had mercy
[41:46] and I would say he had extended Mercy
[41:51] Oh my he had to go way down to pick us
[41:54] up
[41:56] but nevertheless how low you were God
[41:59] didn't look at that
[42:01] God said in spite of
[42:04] he said I'm going to get him anyhow
[42:06] because they belong to me
[42:10] Satan thought he had you but God said
[42:13] Mercy said no
[42:16] and he reached
[42:18] beyond all the boundaries and all what
[42:22] you were doing and what you were into he
[42:25] said ain't nothing too hard for me
[42:31] oh my
[42:35] God somebody said I don't know why
[42:38] Jesus loves me
[42:41] I don't know why he care
[42:44] but I thank you Lord
[42:48] and just that mental thing that I
[42:52] grasped me my mind you know as you look
[42:54] back at your life and and you realize uh
[42:58] what God done and how he done it and and
[43:02] let me tell you something we wouldn't
[43:03] even do that for our own self
[43:06] many of us didn't gave up
[43:11] we didn't count our own self as lost
[43:15] and cast away and then watch God
[43:21] that wasn't about to say you know
[43:24] um you know don't account nobody out
[43:28] and what don't judge nothing before that
[43:30] time because what looked bad now God can
[43:33] turn it around brother Marshall's thing
[43:40] the worst of the worst
[43:43] oh my I mean the loss of the Lost
[43:48] that destitute it that hopeless cakes
[43:53] that uncumer disease
[43:56] God
[43:57] specializes the song saying
[44:03] I like to say like this he just don't
[44:06] specializes in something he specializes
[44:10] in everything
[44:15] and the way he do it
[44:18] is beyond our comprehension
[44:21] always tell the people that come that
[44:24] God don't even need nobody permission
[44:26] how he do it
[44:29] he does it
[44:31] and people try to figure it out and God
[44:35] already doesn't work it out
[44:38] that's why I believe that a Christian
[44:40] Life ought to be a life of rest
[44:44] what are you going to worry about
[44:48] what are you worried about little bride
[44:51] you say fear not little flock
[44:55] come on God got you
[44:59] oh my
[45:00] God there is no sin that's worse enough
[45:03] there's no condition that's deep enough
[45:05] that God can go way down and pick you up
[45:09] and I believe we are eyewitness that God
[45:12] had to come pick us up
[45:16] I know where I was
[45:19] God came
[45:21] nobody came
[45:24] to do that work that he did but he sent
[45:28] his only begotten son
[45:32] and now here we are
[45:36] in the end of all things
[45:40] everything seemed to be
[45:43] chaotic
[45:46] everything seems to be out of control
[45:52] but I want to tell you God Specializes
[45:57] I'll be somebody say in the darkest
[45:59] hours that's when Jesus comes
[46:05] or the doctor that it gets
[46:08] then the light began to show a little
[46:11] more brighter
[46:15] you and I know we're living in a dark
[46:17] age
[46:20] very crucial very uh satanic power the
[46:26] diseases and all kinds of things on
[46:30] every hand seemed to be going on this
[46:33] way that way everything just seemed to
[46:36] be in a pure mess
[46:39] but tonight we got peace
[46:44] peace because we know that Jesus can
[46:48] calm the storm
[46:51] I'm reminded when he was on the ship
[46:55] in the bottom of it and the disciple was
[46:57] on top talking about the goodness of the
[47:01] God and all of a sudden the ship stopped
[47:05] rocking and blowing
[47:07] storm begins to come against the ship
[47:11] where they were at
[47:15] server to God so you think it's Jesus
[47:16] was really sleep
[47:18] you said no I don't think so
[47:21] but he was just resting
[47:25] they were up top testifying about the
[47:28] things and but when the storm came their
[47:31] faith got shook
[47:36] they begin to wonder
[47:38] the ship was about to be described where
[47:41] is Jesus
[47:43] you see he's on the bottom let's go wake
[47:46] him up
[47:49] I believe sometimes we got to go wake
[47:51] Jesus up
[47:54] when your ship began to rock in the
[47:57] winds begin to blow against your life
[47:59] you got to wake Jesus up
[48:05] and he's waiting
[48:07] sometime the way God does it he loud
[48:12] the storm to come
[48:16] you think he worried about the storms
[48:19] you think he worried about the storm
[48:21] that even coming against your life
[48:23] come on he wants you to know I'm on the
[48:26] ship
[48:28] and you got to stir up him and you again
[48:32] see
[48:33] yeah you got to know that no matter how
[48:35] low you get no matter how bad the
[48:38] situation is I'm there
[48:41] he said I'll never forsake you neither
[48:43] will I leave y'all
[48:45] not only will I be with you but I'm
[48:48] going to be in you
[48:52] everywhere you go he's there
[48:57] somebody said if you make your bed in
[49:00] hell he's there
[49:03] he's everywhere
[49:06] don't be weary
[49:09] in well-doing
[49:12] because we understand there is a reward
[49:17] there is a crown for those that endure
[49:23] many may have started out but the race
[49:26] not given to the Swift
[49:30] but can we endure whatever it is that we
[49:34] have to endure in this life right here
[49:39] you and I know that life don't come like
[49:43] we wanted to and things don't be like
[49:47] that God allowed to ship the Rock and
[49:50] the wind to blow
[49:53] what is it
[49:56] you want to see now can you still trust
[49:58] me
[50:00] can you still have confidence me in the
[50:03] midst of what you're going through
[50:06] what did he do he's pressurizing y'all
[50:10] he wants you to know you can't take more
[50:12] than what you think
[50:15] I've been about to say he don't put no
[50:16] more on you than what you can bear
[50:20] and I know it gets hard especially when
[50:24] it comes down in your own house
[50:26] oh you wonder sometime Lord Master do is
[50:30] not care rather be busy yes I care
[50:38] he said you just be still and watch the
[50:41] salvation of the Lord
[50:44] be still do don't worry you know how it
[50:47] gonna happen and you tell us because
[50:49] everything is in the Master Hand
[50:53] everything you do and everything you
[50:56] dealing with and going through it's in
[51:00] his hand
[51:04] God just didn't save you to lose you God
[51:07] ain't in that kind of business
[51:09] but we're going to do he said I'm going
[51:11] to prove those
[51:14] I'm going to prove my people he that
[51:17] that they are worthy of what I've done
[51:20] for them
[51:21] now see job had no idea that God in the
[51:25] Satan was talking about him down there
[51:28] he was going about his everyday life
[51:30] and doing everyday thing but but there
[51:33] was a conversation about Joel because
[51:35] you know God said you know you
[51:37] considered him
[51:39] he said yeah you got a hedger on him
[51:42] show he but remove it
[51:45] drove and had no idea
[51:47] what was going on in heaven
[51:51] and I know it I'm quite sure that thing
[51:53] going on about us
[51:57] and see God got more confidence in you
[51:59] that you got in your own self
[52:02] because he put something in Joy he put
[52:06] something in you and I
[52:09] that he understand listen they may Rock
[52:12] and they may lean but they won't deny me
[52:17] they even make you a little weary and
[52:19] little This and like that but don't
[52:22] worry they're waking up again
[52:26] so I'll see you tonight don't be weary
[52:30] you know well doing don't think that God
[52:34] don't see your labor
[52:38] of love that you have toward him not
[52:41] only him you know sort of God say in
[52:43] order to have the love to God you know
[52:46] he said to love his people
[52:49] he said you can't love God and don't
[52:51] love his people
[52:53] see because as you did it to the least
[52:57] one of them
[52:59] you've done it unto me
[53:01] and you don't know who that lease is
[53:05] sometimes there'd be angels unaware
[53:08] sitting right side the road
[53:12] and God allow you to pass by
[53:16] that burger that person who helpless or
[53:20] maybe uh you know not fortunate as you
[53:24] are
[53:26] and God allow you the opportunity just
[53:28] to show a little love to that person
[53:32] you see so you don't know who you are
[53:35] entertaining
[53:36] could be angels
[53:42] but if you misrepresent God the wrong
[53:44] way
[53:45] that's why I want to be careful what I
[53:48] do
[53:50] and I just don't want to mistreat
[53:53] anybody
[53:55] not intentionally no
[53:57] I'll be the Bible say here
[54:00] let me read that
[54:01] correctly
[54:06] tenth verse you say as we have therefore
[54:08] opportunity
[54:10] let us do good to all men
[54:13] and then he said especially
[54:18] unto them who are of the household of
[54:21] faith
[54:22] in other words especially
[54:26] for those who are like Precious saints
[54:30] of God
[54:33] I wonder sometimes we'll realize you
[54:36] know when we treat one another certain
[54:38] ways that you're treating God
[54:46] when we get conscious enough and
[54:48] reverence enough that I can't treat this
[54:52] one in any kind of way I can't just say
[54:54] anything that could because why because
[54:56] they are the household of faith
[54:59] he said especially in other words
[55:02] there's something special about those of
[55:05] the household of faith
[55:09] you know I really when I hear the things
[55:12] the servant of God said how he really
[55:14] treated people
[55:16] even those that didn't even agree
[55:20] with his men
[55:23] agree with what he was doing
[55:26] he still regarded them that's my brother
[55:31] that I've been listening to a message of
[55:32] the night and uh it was a debate and
[55:35] brother uh Bosworth I believe was on the
[55:38] platform with a guy that was trying to
[55:40] show brother ran him up and debate and
[55:42] all and he was an older man and he just
[55:45] sat there talked to the man coming in
[55:46] scripture and and then um the guy said a
[55:49] lot of ugly things you know about the
[55:51] servant of God and and brother Banner
[55:53] finally came down you know and you know
[55:55] he said he said listen my brother you
[55:58] got a right to disagree
[56:00] you know what he didn't treat him no
[56:03] different
[56:04] and not only him even just some of the
[56:07] vowel people that uh brought accusation
[56:10] and did all kind of things to him he
[56:13] still had enough wisdom you know I'm
[56:16] saying to treat them like a brother
[56:20] and I said you know it's a shame that
[56:23] the example he had it was the same it
[56:25] was down to that Christ had
[56:28] you know he loved the unlovable
[56:32] even those that didn't agree with him I
[56:36] mean
[56:36] always said it's okay to be disagreeable
[56:41] there's nothing wrong with that
[56:43] you know I mean this because we don't
[56:45] see eye to eye on everything they said
[56:47] that you know but that don't make us odd
[56:50] well in a way it might do but you'll
[56:53] peculiar in your own way
[56:56] I always tell you all the time what if
[56:59] God wanted to meet everybody just like
[57:01] you
[57:02] you wouldn't like that so God he said
[57:05] got a uh a variety
[57:09] flowers and bouquet and different
[57:12] countries different nationalities but
[57:15] with the same Spirit you still God
[57:20] I wanna
[57:30] be his first Corinthians
[57:33] 15
[57:36] don't be weary
[57:40] in well doing
[57:43] no sometime we to feel like you know
[57:47] nobody really care
[57:51] because sometimes the way people may
[57:52] handle things uh I treat you sometimes
[57:55] it's like sometimes they do have a maybe
[57:58] a nonchalant attitude toward it
[58:02] they don't really see the urgency that
[58:04] with the hour that we are in right now
[58:08] with so much going on and this new thing
[58:12] they got comment control
[58:15] cop 27 all kind of different things that
[58:19] they are trying to Institute and they're
[58:21] pushing talking reiterating into one
[58:24] world order system
[58:27] bringing everybody all the world
[58:29] religious leaders to a great Gathering
[58:33] to set some standards you know on
[58:36] comment control
[58:38] and things of that nature
[58:42] in First Corinthians
[58:53] 15 and 58
[58:57] therefore my beloved brethren
[59:00] be you steadfast
[59:02] unmovable
[59:03] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[59:07] for as much as you know that your labor
[59:10] is not in vain in the Lord
[59:15] you know that's why you know when we uh
[59:19] whatever we do you know we want to do it
[59:22] according
[59:23] to what God put on our hearts
[59:27] but we don't want to do it separately or
[59:29] grudgingly we ought to do it because of
[59:31] the love of God that's been shared
[59:34] abroad because
[59:35] everything you do for God you will be
[59:40] rewarded for it
[59:41] and if you decide to do evil you're
[59:44] going to rewrite be wrong for that too
[59:49] God is Not mocked
[59:54] someone said well I ain't gonna do
[59:56] nothing but then how do you expect to
[59:59] get a reward
[1:00:01] for nothing
[1:00:04] but everybody whether they know it want
[1:00:06] to believe it or not
[1:00:08] you were doing something
[1:00:11] but I want to do that which is right
[1:00:15] I want to do that with God had laid upon
[1:00:18] my heart and regardless if nobody know
[1:00:23] God knows
[1:00:25] if nobody sees there's nobody never you
[1:00:28] know yet sometimes say everybody love a
[1:00:30] little pat on the back but the detailing
[1:00:33] things that people do you know it don't
[1:00:36] have to be known
[1:00:42] maybe something you said here
[1:00:45] he said don't never be weary
[1:00:49] in well-doing
[1:00:51] for you will certainly reap in due
[1:00:54] season
[1:00:56] if you think not
[1:00:58] always do that which is right
[1:01:02] and whatever that God has said in his
[1:01:04] book The Bible
[1:01:06] you believe that
[1:01:08] where you can hang your soul on any
[1:01:12] phase of the word of God
[1:01:14] you believe that don't you now whatever
[1:01:17] he has promised in the word that God
[1:01:21] will do for God is under obligation to
[1:01:25] his word
[1:01:29] I like that
[1:01:31] he's on the obligation to his word
[1:01:34] that's why he said abide let my word
[1:01:37] abide in you
[1:01:38] see let the words stay let it remain
[1:01:43] let it remain in you'll see
[1:01:45] God got to have something to work with
[1:01:49] and that's why we you know austelli
[1:01:52] David said like he said Lord uh let me
[1:01:55] hear that word in our heart that I may
[1:01:57] not sin
[1:01:59] let me hide it in my heart that I mean I
[1:02:01] sinned against you
[1:02:04] see
[1:02:06] because God is the word
[1:02:10] he said look at this Junction
[1:02:13] between separation or right and wrong
[1:02:16] and Abraham what a Time Abraham seemed
[1:02:19] like and he got the Raw Deal
[1:02:22] it seemed like tonight because that you
[1:02:25] were separated yourself from the things
[1:02:27] of the world that you got a wrong deal
[1:02:30] don't be wearing well doing
[1:02:32] for in due season you shall reap
[1:02:36] he that endureth unto the end Jesus said
[1:02:40] the same shall be saved just looking on
[1:02:45] keep moving slowly God knows what he is
[1:02:51] doing
[1:02:52] we're the only one gets in a hurry not
[1:02:56] him
[1:02:57] he let the Hebrew children walk right in
[1:03:00] the fiery furnace before he ever turned
[1:03:04] a page
[1:03:06] over to about a new article sure God's
[1:03:10] in no hurry he know what he's doing what
[1:03:13] he's going to do we don't but we believe
[1:03:16] it by faith because he said
[1:03:19] he'll do it amen how many of you believe
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:25] God ain't in a hurry
[1:03:29] God sometime and let it get so bad
[1:03:33] so low
[1:03:36] he never get that way sometime as I've
[1:03:39] seen even in certain people doubt the
[1:03:42] case is helpless
[1:03:45] that they can't even find nothing to
[1:03:47] help the people with
[1:03:51] now it come the time are you going to
[1:03:53] trust God
[1:03:57] thank God for medical science I
[1:03:59] appreciate them
[1:04:01] but we understand the Medical Science
[1:04:03] can't go but so far
[1:04:07] and even beyond that even if they would
[1:04:10] have given you something to make it
[1:04:12] better for you he said God is the one
[1:04:15] who got to do the healing
[1:04:19] they can set a bone and they can break
[1:04:21] it but God has to heal
