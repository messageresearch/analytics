just kind of stopped things but we're still going on and thank god in jesus name praise god that we still can have service amen so we appreciate them amen and we appreciate all of you that have come i know i'll miss somebody but by the grace of god if i did that it wasn't intentionally the brothers coming from ohio where y'all stand for the inaudible praise god we appreciate them coming down from ohio it's a lot of saints i think we had about half of the not even half of the saints that usually come because of the the conditions amen i want you to pray for the sanction uh jamaica brother keith you know he was supposed to be preaching the meeting and uh because of the situation the covet and all we we said we put him off to a later date and hopefully later on this year brother keith from jamaica but pray for them they've closed down jamaica for now i think they got him to close down for seven days or something like that but pray for the saints over in jamaica amen things are getting hard over there and we're just trusting the lord god god to keep his people amen i don't know what else i'm supposed to say amen but god is good amen and we appreciate brother brooks and sister brooks will you stand again from damon ohio i mean demon iowa okay we appreciate them coming flying in from there helping us out every year we certainly uh our senator uh brother brooks i said i don't know

though the conditions are like they are you press your way and that means a whole lot that we just keep pressing on amen i know god sees our effort and god will be with us amen and give us victory every day may god bless you amen brother let's stand and i don't want to sing a song because i know brother brooks sing and so y'all don't want me to sing so pastor brooks from des moines iowa amen originally from columbia south carolina amen but he's there amen ministering in des moines and iowa city god bless you [Applause] well we give honor to our lord and savior jesus christ we thank the lord for being so good to us and it is a privilege and an honor to to be here this morning we've had a lovely word to come forth throughout the week i thank god for my uh precious brother simmons and his wife family they have been more than just a family to us and uh you know i can say that you may be seated just i can truly say that god is uh some friends are gifts from god and and that's what brother simmons has been to me a gift from god because it's really hard to find real friends and uh you know i just thank the lord uh for him and the church here basically have all grown up together my lovely wife who's with been with me and her coming here is a miracle and the lord uh blessed where we had a nice flight she just doesn't like uh flying so we had a good trip going and we had a and we're trusting the lord we're coming we have a trusted lord will give us a good trip going back she and i have eight children and about 18 grandkids or something like that but anyway she knows the exact number i don't but you know god is so good to us and i am the least of all and i don't say that to sound humble but if you know where god has brought me from and the many things that he's taken me through and i know some of you could relate to it many times you you thought you were about to lose your mind but god kept you and i can truly say that the lord has truly been my my place of worship and uh we're gonna sing and then we'll get right into the word of god i know this the last service and and i i hope you don't shut down on me i i think the last should be given the best amen amen amen surely god is good to us give me a key of c please i must acknowledge the lord first of all because he is my all in all ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention i'd like to introduce to you in this corner of the good and the is [Music] reaches everywhere [Music] [Music] hey help me sing it he's greater no one could ever take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns he's the all time undisputed undefeated champion of love [Music] he left his home to eat arena to raise his head in victory for you and me but you see there was an angry crowd that cried crucified he who wore their crown and they watched my champion [Music] but i will never count him out cause i'm a witness of that day he rose to proclaim the love he's higher than the highest he's greater than the great no one could [Music] is [Music] undefeated of love [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's my champion [Music] i'm just going to sing one little up tip one and we'll get right into the word of god and perhaps afterwards if the lord terry would allow we sing a little more day people ask me why you like to sing so much i can't help it amen amen amen i'm so glad i'm so glad i'm talking like oh oh yes i couldn't walk right through the garden [Music] jesus christ is the captain the word of god is not breathless the holy ghost will direct us and the sovereign spirit will us [Music] [Music] yes oh [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] right right i'm [Music] hallelujah [Music] i'm so happy tonight or this morning [Music] that god was gracious to me [Music] i think sometimes we take it all for granted the salvation of the lord but i'm trusting that god will do a great work in our lives today if you would turn with me to the scriptures we ask that you turn there's several things i'm trying to think of what to do and how to direct it but i know god is with us this morning there's a lot of thoughts that i like to bring this morning so let's just turn to isaiah 43. isaiah 43 how many of y'all really believe the word i know it's hot and i probably shouldn't have sang that fast song but i just kind of wanted to you know uh get the blood going in and by god's grace uh i just take my time here this morning when everything has that's been said uh i know that uh the lord is faithful let's go to isaiah uh 43 beginning at the first verse but now thus said the lord that created thee o jacob and he that created and see o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by my name and thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when thou walketh through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom in ethiopia and siva for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee therefore will i give thee give men for thee and people for thy life let us pray our gracious father we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being our all in all and we pray uh this morning that you have preeminence here lord destroy the works of the enemy opens our hearts and our minds to your word and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated on the last time i spoke i spoke of the urgency of how things is really urgent and i believe that oftentimes people don't understand that word urgent most of the time when something becomes urgent it produces like a desperation i got to get it done i got to get it done now uh just in in life we know how a bill may come and they say well if you don't get it paid by this time of the day we're going to cut your lights off or we're going to cut your water off and you know it's amazing because we find ourselves more concerned about what the neighbors are going to think when they see the water man or the electric man out there cutting our lights off it's it's a it's nothing but a spirit of pride hallelujah but the urgency should not come because we're concerned about what others think but you need your lights to be remain on or your water to remain on but nevertheless you do whatever you can do to get that done is that right and you and i when we talk about urgency i think in zechariah that tells us that when the vision has been made clear with made plain let him that readeth run because once that vision of the end time has made been made plain and clear to us a god amen will not tarry he's not going to wait on you right i mean the truth of the matter is god has a set time and an appointed time to do what needs to be done and god will send warnings he'll give us grace and then to hear the warnings and sometimes people just ignore the warnings for an example when pearl harbor when the japanese were going to bomb pearl harbor you know the american soldiers we had heard that the japanese were planning to bomb us but because of our pride because of our arrogancy uh we we ignored it we went on partying and having a great time but you see it never stopped the japanese from bombing pearl harbor yeah understand me it it was a time of urgency they heard the warning but they ignored it and anytime you hear an alarm go off on urgency something that's urgent amen you you you you have a right to to hear it and you have a right to ignore it hallelujah is that right now we know by god's grace when we see a fire truck or a police car or an alarm that goes off and then we know immediately to stop and to look around to see which direction that urgent vehicle is coming and we respect that right we'll pull over to the side and give that situation a man a priority but you still have a right you can take heed to it or you can actually ignore it and then when you ignore it you're bound to get in some type of accident hallelujah even because there's an urgency a situation going on that's how it was amen when the uh the the woman whose son died uh from a headstroke and elijah had given this woman it meant a son by way of of the spoken word right and this son grew up and perhaps what happened the father out in the field and then all of a sudden something happened maybe he had a sunstroke of some sort but nevertheless he fell dead and this woman who could not have a son told her servant said whatever you do don't you stop for nothing cause she hadn't tried everything elijah had left behind but she found out it wasn't working you see what i'm saying when you find out that you pray for something and it's not working it should produce an urgency somebody help me here see you and i must understand what we're talking about this morning is a matter of life and death huh and so what happens she tells her servant that's why i try to tell people when you're in a in a situation and you gotta run the red light don't stop right it's an urgency and you know time is not on your side hallelujah and in the word of god said elijah saw coming from a distance and god had not even shown him the situation oh but it's a wonderful thing when you know you got somebody you can turn to in a time of need hallelujah so what happens hey man she she says whatever you do wishing god uh saw elijah this is the thing when she saw elijah and elijah saw her he he he herald to her how you doing what's happening is everything all right she didn't say oh my goodness my son is dead and it looks like there's no hope you know what she said all is well y'all understand me your attitude in every situation must remain positive hallelujah why because out of your love our creed will perceive words of creation whether it's to destroy you or to build you up hallelujah oh god help us in so there's an urgency and i liken it to that time when this woman had to get to elijah stop for nothing we're talking about the resurrection this is what we're working with this morning because you and i must understand this message that god has brought to us in this day is different from the message of the lay of the seas this message amen ties into matthew 25 with ten versions a man heard a cry at midnight and they went to meet right the bible said they all had lamps and had all in their lamps but you see five of them were wise and five was foolish and the foolish virgins listened they were clean living people i'm not talking about belonging to a church and you're still living any kind of way but these people were clean living people y'all hear me so what happened here man these these virgins the five ran out of oil and right now this is what i see people either you're running out of oil running low on oil something is happening but one thing i could truly say to you this morning amen no matter what it is when you find your prayer life going down you see that the love that you have for god seem to be you know growing small you're not witnessing you're not praying you're not fasting that's when you get down on your knees somebody help me here that's the time you refill because we need refilling every day don't you let your oil run out i'm coming so we realized by god's grace these wise virgins had oil and they had extra oil hallelujah i'm just going to stop right there because we're living in if i could say it like this we're living in the day or the hour of the resurrection we've been promised a rapture and everybody's been somewhat looking for it but there are those who are losing the expectation of seeing a rapture because it's been spoken of for so long but what people do not understand is that this rapture is a secret it is not you're not going to find it on youtube you're not going to find it on facebook you're not going to find this rapture amen in the newspaper hearing itself the rapture will take place in 10 days and you know what the attitude of the people would be if they knew that that time and the exact date and the exact hour you know what they would say well i might as well party a little bit right now i got 10 days to work it you understand me you don't give people that kind of time because we weak within ourselves y'all hear what i'm saying oh it is just what we do if we do it on a common uh grounds we know a bill that needs to be paid 10 days and we see a little suit or a nice dress and we know the bill needs to be paid but i got 10 more days we do stuff like that it's just the natural it's what we do and god knows us hallelujah that's why he said be ready oh lord here i come i used to wonder how this thing was going to take place but let me tell you something god always announces it he announced the birth of jesus it may have taken a long time but it got here y'all hear what i'm saying and regardless of how long it took there was still a few people waiting for it there was some an expectation to see it see god has never left himself without a witness now i'm getting ready i'm going to say something now because the announcement of god translation is a revelation that's only given to the elected it's not given to everybody just like everybody don't see angels hallelujah see god is god is god is awesome i think about the economy of god let me stop that you know the economy god i said god is so awesome i just can't hardly wait to just stare in his eyes he's awesome think about this every generation has the supply of everything it needs to survive there are a certain number of doctors that are born every day to replace the ones that are now living there are a certain amount of musicians you know that's when people say you can be whatever you want to no you can't that's not true hallelujah you can only be what god has ordained you to be [Applause] is that right think about the people amen that what they could sing y'all know that's the truth and some people who think they can sing but that's a gift i didn't ask for it and those seekers that can't see they didn't ask for it we didn't have to work at it hallelujah think about the musicians you say oh i wish i was a musician that's about as far as it going to go if that if that gift is not there y'all understand me so you and i we must know understand that whatever we are ordained to be is what we're going to be there's no use or no need to get jealous of someone else you can do something they can't do and they can do something you can't do oh i think about all of the churches i said you know what that devil is a smart critter i said because if we could ever get on one accord we'll wipe his kingdom out within a second but he knows how to divide us and you know how he does it by jealousy it's all jealousy that's why we need the holy ghost that's why we need the power of god because wherever the spirit of the lord is there is liberty hallelujah and he whom the son set free is free indeed hallelujah is that right remember jesus disciples asked the question who's going to be the greatest and jesus said don't think like that that's how the heathens that's how the gentiles think hallelujah but i'll tell you the secret the greatest in my kingdom is the least is that right oh let's move on with this so you and i must understand that we're living in the age of the greatest mystery and that mystery is the coming of the lord oh come on somebody y'all got quiet on me that you see because then it's it's a mystery doesn't mean it remains a mystery a secret is not always a secret once it's told hallelujah but this is why it's so important to be in the spirit because it's in the spirit is when you receive things from the lord is that right i was thinking of this the other day and i've tyler told his testimony before amen y'all know about the life magazine and the cloud and all these things and i can remember the time when this white man came to the neighborhood and he was showing me this cloud or this thing that was happening in the night magazine and he opened it up he says the lord is soon to come he said can you see the face of jesus and none of the other boys could see it but when i saw it you know what he did he shut the book and walked away and i never seen that book again until i came to this message how many of y'all remember that one song that god gave me i'm gonna sing it at the end yes he descended in a cloud he gave his word with a shout time will be when no will never be right we're living in eternity right he's the one that called us out of satan's system you know i'm saying this thing and you know it's just like what in the world now things are beginning to open up to me so you said well what do you mean brothers remember one thing jesus said to martha and mary he said i am the resurrection hallelujah and they says well lord we know in that day see when they wanted to put it off and here was a resurrection standing right in front of him here was the seventh seal talking them and they couldn't even recognize it and he said unto them roll away the stone if you want to see the resurrection if you want to see the son of man word come to pass roll away the stone of unbelief roll away the stone of your denomination roll away the stone of your organization and you're going to see a miracle y'all understand me see the thing about the resurrection is it's so mysterious but we make it more mysterious it's something that you have to have faith in huh even coming even being raised from the dead you have to have faith in god that it can be done hallelujah think about it talk about the resurrection now and we know the resurrection is not getting something new and bringing it back up it's actually taking the old that which went down and bringing it back up that's the day we're living in and the bible says and i'm my scripture's there but i'm gonna go head on the bible says that the dead in christ should rise first we didn't know what that was until jesus raised himself raised from the dead right and the bible says many of the saints that slept rose hallelujah and walked around the city see when jesus got up everything that belonged to him that was ordained to get up got up y'all understand me you said oh brother yes i understand i you know i've got the holy ghost don't you know what the holy ghost is let me say it like this do you know who the holy ghost is hallelujah that's why the devil don't want you to get it because he knows if you ever get the holy ghost his battles are over he can fight you as much as he possibly can but he can never stop the journey hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying this morning he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you now this can't hardly stand people i'm so bored bored you hadn't prayed in a while bored but ain't nobody loving me what how can that be jesus said i'll never leave you i never forsake you somehow you got amnesia you've forgotten who's with you and you have forgotten who's in you hallelujah he said i'll never leave you neither will i forsake you oh lord i just feel so alone that's the devil's lie hallelujah i'm coming so what happens jesus says if you really believe you'll see the resurrection because i am the resurrection right now you think about it he told them to roll away the stones i still wish i was dead i wish i could have seen those two women roll that big old stone away i don't know whether they got help the bible doesn't say it just said that they rolled the stone away y'all understand me they weren't bodybuilders they were real women [Laughter] hallelujah they were real sweet and soft do we have any of those kind left i know i've got one over there now i feel i really wish y'all could get a wife like mine hallelujah but she's mine you know so anyway when you look at these things and you say oh brothers what is wrong with you what i'm trying to say let me hurry up because i'm going too slow you need to see that the light that this holy spirit is to give you is to bring a change if you have not seen a change in your life since you have declared that you have the holy spirit something's wrong oh come on somebody she because the holy ghost is not just the holy ghost but the holy ghost is holy ghost and fire and when that fire comes in you it burns the desire of the world out of you hallelujah y'all hear me i remember when i first got saved and and one of my sisters and her boyfriend had that big old colt 45. see that was my drink yeah i partied and danced like everybody else y'all hear me everybody in the neighborhood knew where to come i was a weekend man y'all hear what i'm saying but when god changed me let me tell you and when he changed let me say if he could change me he can change you i don't care who you are god can change you my family thought i had lost my mind put me to every test hallelujah hey that come right home from church and they had that big old coke 45 they're sweating i walked right by hallelujah why because when god took that from me he took it from me y'all understand me there's no desire he takes away the desire [Applause] hallelujah oh god help us here because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changed not you know what i don't care if i don't get your amen i got the amen in me hallelujah you understand me we are in a time that we must understand that the seventh seal is what brought the rapture on i know some of y'all don't know what i'm talking about in the book of revelation the seventh seal was opened and his ears opened hallelujah it was the resurrection seal y'all hear it that's how come we know the rapture is right now and believe you or not it's happening right now why because god has called the people out of laodicea and he's changing them from glory to glory it's not that you're going to be partying and all of a sudden the snap of the a twinkling of the eye and you in heaven no sigh you got to prove yourself here oh it's the truth hallelujah that's why i was silenced in heaven because nobody knew how he was going to do it when he was going to do it even the prophet god didn't know jesus said at that time he didn't know hallelujah but it was in the father's hand now y'all think i'm preaching two gods and i'm not there's only one god and that god is the lord jesus christ hallelujah but if he want to be president he's a he can that's right if he want to be a secretary he can if he want to be a judge he can if he wants to be a jury he can why he's a god of him are they he's a god that changes his mask oh lord help me here so let me move on he rolled away the stone they rode away the stone and jesus is something about jesus you know when he calls your name nobody else may not hear it hallelujah oh come on brethren you know it it's something about the way your wife call your name she doesn't have to say what's your name and you know what the rest is it can be sweet and it can be unsweet but just in the way they call your name you know whether something's good gonna happen or something's bad like that likewise with a man y'all know what i'm saying but it's something about the name of jesus when jesus calls your name it gets your attention wait a minute brother rose yes i don't know there's no scientific explanation he was a dead man dead and rotted four days don't know where he journeyed to but when jesus called his name hallelujah the science the cosmos everything had to obey and everything began to restore y'all understand me there's something that's happening in the pride that's restoring even though you can't see it the story when when lazarus come hopping out of that grave all jesus could say is loose the man and let him go because see once the word of god catches you by calling your name there's got to be somebody a ministry that can remove the grave clothes huh because what you don't understand amen that these organizations and nominations and things of that nature let me tell you something there are christians in all of them don't get me wrong but there are those who are wearing gray clothes and they don't even do it hallelujah but the message will cause those grave clothes to be taken away from you why because we're not living in a day of touch not taste not hand or not we're living in the day of election we're living in the day of god chose me chose you before the foundation of the world we're living in a day a predestination we have been predestinated here by his foreknowledge to do what live the world let me hurry by god's grace you love the lord hallelujah we we must understand like i said god in every type of the word every type is explaining and bringing revelation to us you know we saw those stories as stories right right we thought it was such good stories right you know we saw samson and and all he did and we thought wow that's wonderful but samson was a story of prophecy he was a character that god used to prophesy what was going to happen in this day y'all hear me in in samson we saw amen how samson was chosen he was what a nazirite and what is the bride a nazirite he was a nazarite he was ordained to do the will of god and his purpose was to kill the philistines hallelujah but just like some of us we go in our power and our strength how many y'all remember when you first got saved you could move mountains right the miracles the things that god would do for you amen you couldn't help but to tell it but guess what delilah started wooing you right the world started wooing you and all of a sudden your attraction to her made you lose the attraction from the purpose for which you were born help us somebody see the pride of jesus christ you're the light of the world oh that means wherever you go people should see who jesus is oh help us lord is this okay because i want you to understand the resurrection is on i haven't got to the way i'm going but i want you to understand all of these shadows and types because he was he was already blinded now then got caught by delilah the mystery of the seven thunders is gone the seven seals is gone right the hair was gone but the root was still there hallelujah is that right that's what makes you different because you're the seed with the root hallelujah that's what the bible says jesus was a root and offspring of david oh come on somebody and when you realize honey oh i love this i love this because i realize that nothing the devil can do to stop me nothing david amen i mean excuse yeah come to him and he's uh he remembers you know how bad it gets sometime we don't pray we don't study and that's why people can't rejoice when the word come because most of the time they don't study and they don't have well know what you're talking about especially when you preach it now if i taught it and gave you all the quotes and all the scriptures and you said why but you see you supposed to be the word by now huh that book you say i ate you become that book you understand me now the bible tells me that jesus he said he was a living waters and out of him he said it flowed living that's what he told the woman at the well if you take of me you'll never have to go to that denominational teachings anymore i'll give you rivers of waters that will flow up into eternal life i'm talking to everybody here who's married to a system you're supposed to be married to the world where brothers saw and saw a bishop so-and-so a deacon source or a pope so i don't care about stuff like that what'd the words say the word is your handship but let's go home i'm sorry but you look at this thing you say oh brother what are you saying here we come david this is the part i really like he said maybe there's a possibility there's a possibility that god will hear my prayer again y'all know what i'm saying how many you've done wrong so much and haven't felt god in such a long time to the devil tell you or you don't cross the line the devil is such a liar he's a liar as long as you have a desire to serve god god is still there he's still there i don't care how wretched you've been i don't care where how glow you going you're the kind god enough to raise up god don't come for the goody goods god comes for the trash he comes for the man and the woman who know they need salvation is that right he don't come to the religious kind because the religious kind feel like they don't need him but let me tell you something i need him i need him every day every hour every moment of the day i need him hallelujah and here he's david says well uh samson excuse me says maybe there's a possibility i love that that means it's possible and what do you got to lose right take hold of the possibility it says lord have mercy and do it for me one more time lord i need a revive out it's been a long time since i felt your presence it's been a long time since i prayed an hour come on somebody y'all know how it is it's gotten so difficult now you can barely pray 15 minutes hallelujah but god is a god of restoration hallelujah if i was you i wouldn't leave out here without god touching me oh i take that possibility and i run with it i don't have to feel it the feeling comes later hallelujah yes lord he said oh lord once more people say well oh he was talking to the nomination no he wasn't not in the message i'm talking about he was already kicked out of the nomination jesus christ was hallelujah when he said once more lord that means this old bride who he claimed to be bride was going to fall into a situation where she was going to have to cry oh lord once more that's what brother jackson were talking about talking about the glory of god you understand me the glory of god is god in you hallelujah it is just not enough to see it glorified in somebody else saint john 17. father the glory that you and i had together from the beginning i want them to have it who jesus i don't know about y'all but i i'm not gonna settle for what i uh uh i've seen religion too long everybody won't be i don't want religion i can't stand it i can't stand even when people act like they holding and then the moment you cross them they biting your head off something wrong with your holy ghost oh it's true yes you still got a temper you still got to pray that's got to go y'all understand me oh i hate oh i gotta i you know yeah yeah you know how people say oh i forgave him but i don't care if i ever see him again the devil just lied to you you still got a problem and can i say it like this no unclean thing i don't care if you got demons you say oh i've been baptizing the name of these guys and i've been filled with the holy ghost and you got demons hanging on you you need to get them off yeah oh my god no unclean thing is going to enter into that city that's why he said only going to be a few that's making it you know why because your religion has told you that you're okay that way because grace is sufficient god is calling for perfection and if the blood of jesus christ cannot destroy the devils in your life that same blood is not qualified to save you help us jesus you say he washes away all my sins that's exactly what he does and the holy ghost will burn every devil away from your soul i'm not saying that you'll never be tempted but understand whenever you are tempted the bible says you are drawn away with your own lust god didn't do that your lust did it you still got darkness that need to be getting gotten rid of oh god help us jesus let me hurry up by god's grace hallelujah god come down and and give goliath excuse me david samson i'm coming samson one more chance and guess what he's in the book the hall of fame according to hebrew god don't even talk about what he did he just talks about the victory you understand me you say well how can he doesn't do that because the blood of jesus christ washes it cleanses it it takes it back to wherever it was before it got here is that right the bible said abraham never staggered that used to make me stagger yeah because i know what abraham did it's written what abraham did he wasn't so obedient in the natural but what we failed to see is that god gave him an unconditional covenant hallelujah and who god justify is justified [Music] and god said as he did and judge abraham he judges abraham see just a lie let me hurry let me hurry i really appreciate your patience so amen you understand that where we are we are in a time of the resurrection remember the story remember the story when there were two women and it came to solomon y'all remember that story both of them had babies at the same time and those babies types out like revival but this one revival died the baby died and this this this woman tried to claim the others baby right right and and and and and solomon they went before solomon who was the judge solomon being a prophet he said bring me the baby since y'all gonna argue about it see that's what it is you know denominationals and like i said like this a lot of people don't care to have a halfway revival you know you feel good that's all no i come to revivals to be changed why do you go to church to be changed i want the washing of the water of the word i want it to change me that's why i go that's why i come to hear the word that's why i read the word i read the word so i can become the words right so anyway this other one says no uh yes kill it give her half and give me half but the real mom says nah you see i don't want half of the word [Applause] i want it all i want i don't want a dead letter i want something living y'all understand me i don't want half of it the bride don't want half of the message she don't want half of the revival she wants a whole revival that's where we are this yes morning i didn't come here to be a theologian i didn't come here just to be a christian i'm i'm beyond that i come here by god's grace amen to do what to be the bride of jesus hallelujah and this is what god wants he wants us to be the bride and it cannot come back void is that right i'm sorry i preached so long but let me just finish up quickly you and i must understand that the satan wants to destroy you he wants to destroy you now you know i know you're hot i'm hot too but let me say it like this you see sometimes it takes a long time for people to realize they're true sons and daughters of god but when it happens nothing can change and i'd rather see somebody you know all of a sudden 20 years or 30 years all of a sudden the light switches on you know what happens they get they get revengeful they they they want to to to uh redeem the time and they can become some of the greatest witnesses ever but the bible says you need to take heed to yourself let's at any time your heart be overcharged with suffering and that's the excess you know i gotta have more i i you know i just can't just work the normal time i gotta have overtime because i want over and then chess i gotta do this i gotta do that i gotta and see that's what happens you know the devil is smart he gives you we know about the tv and all of those things so he gives you a phone [Music] don't tell y'all know it the phone has become your god you hear the little d you wake up you answer it god say get up and pray you say five more minutes right that's the way we do god okay don't look at me like i'm crazy it's true that same thing with become will become a snare to you yes it will it's a trap it's to keep you from being consecrated it's a it's a thing that y'all know i hate the phone but at the same time you got to use it for business right there was a time amen that we used to have those phones and we had the message those machines people that leave the message on the machine as soon as the machine would cut on they would hang up they don't do that with the iphone no they gonna leave you a message and if they can't give you the voicemail they're gonna text it what is it the devil consuming our time it's the truth i don't know about facebook i'm not on there i don't condemn a lot you know everything is good and evil it's what you do with it but i find out that a lot of people don't do the right thing hallelujah and then you worry about the government with instruments in your house and you got facebook and you're telling it all right it makes no sense to me y'all understand me we are holy people if we're going to have a facebook let's face the book [Applause] let's tell it to jesus he's the one that can heal us he's the one that can deliver us he's the one that saves us hallelujah i didn't get a chance to go even where i wanted to go but nevertheless i want you to understand when god opened that seventh seal and those same angels come out of heaven and god put i know y'all have a problem with the crowd but the bible says he will appear to those who love his appearing you missed that you missed the rapture and i'm just going to voice this out because of my time but when jesus died and when he rose again from the dead the bible said that the saints rose with it right is that right i want you to think about mount transfiguration because mount transfiguration was a prelude to the rapture and there stood moses and elijah there that right all right so even at the grave site when jesus rose from the dead no no wrong nobody could roll that stone away that seal had to be broken by god himself why because he was that seventh seed y'all understand me he's the one he broke the seal hallelujah [Music] then as i said at the gravesite mary then all looking in there he says why do you seek the living among the dead hallelujah here he goes again here's the seventh seal here's jesus talking and and he's acting like a gardener at least that's what she thought he was and she turned because now she's looking into the grave she's looking into the tomb and she sees moses and elijah y'all something's being said hallelujah that's that wasn't where the light was the life had been resurrected then she turned and she saw a garden that the resurrection is over the resurrection is on and everybody that went to the tomb did not see jesus hallelujah but you see god gave her eyes to see i believe it's that mary who had seven demons who typed out the bride of jesus christ in seven church ages hallelujah she stood there she says revenue where did you lay him where is he [Music] and all he had to do was say mary something about that voice you see that's how the message call you when you hear it you may not hear your name isaiah or john or james but something in you that makes you know it's right something makes you want to follow it you can't even explain it hallelujah you say what brother brooks what are you saying think about it those peter james john and all of those who were fishing and jesus said come follow me quit their jobs left their families didn't even have an explanation and here was jesus who said foxes have holes birds have nests but i have no place to lay my head but yet these men followed him y'all understand me it's a predestinated situation it's an election situation we can't explain it [Music] hallelujah you understand what i'm saying when god calls you you've got to go [Music] that's the way it was with your salvation they call me crazy boy you crazy you could have been this you could have been that no i could not have been i'm exactly what god wants me to be so let's move on by god's grace and i'm almost done she saw the resurrection on the road to emmaus this is the message people [Music] but here was two disciples walking down till they rolled him on the road emails and here come a stranger see i love god the bible said he knows them that are his hallelujah you know when you were in that system something was telling you something's wrong you know what the devil told you that that wasn't the devil something was telling you something right and then something would make you look at the word and look at what the people were doing he says don't measure out you know the devil didn't tell you that that was him [Music] you didn't see him no more than rebecca saw him when rebecca was at that well perhaps a half hour before eliezer got there some inspiration told her there's coming some man and he's going to want you to water his men y'all understand me but in return don't just give the man water give his camels water too see you understand what i'm saying this message is not just written but it's revelation that the bride catches is what the prophet god said reading between the lies you know you you respond to what's in you and that's what people don't understand when god said eat the word you became those seven thunders [Music] oh yes sir see i know you don't know what i'm talking about but it's the life of christ living itself seven thunders is not a thing it's a person [Music] it's the nature of christ in you hallelujah and just closing i know you're tired but just closing looking back and seeing what malachi 4 did [Music] it's wonderful i see what moses did i've seen what david has done solomon all of them but this is your day [Music] hallelujah is not enough to say our message you must be vindicated and it's not by the knowledge you know [Music] it's about the quality of christ it's the christ that's in you that will vindicate you y'all know what i'm saying remember that woman amen that was out south there and she was waiting waiting because she had prayed all night she had a son that was sick [Music] god said i'm sending you elijah she prayed and the holy spirit nothing written nothing written nothing written summer she she seen a vision a dream whatever it was but the inspiration she stood there on the fence waiting for elijah you understand me she was some unwritten word standing there but now she's written hallelujah she's standing there waiting and then when he showed up says howdy parson how do you know i'm a person amen god doesn't show me have you ever heard of elijah knew but i'm kind of i'm not like that shooting my woman god gave me a son and he he went out and he had a social uh disease and now he's dying she didn't even care whether he got healed or not she just didn't want him so lost that's the way i feel about my children ah i want to see them say no matter what the cost see y'all got quiet because you don't know eternal life is far better than this little time vapor oh my god [Music] in closing that woman was in the land of goliath and she didn't even know about elijah until he showed up you understand me he said you he said her prayer causes goosebumps my hair to stand up on my head you can tell she had talked to god [Music] see it get rid of your these denominational issues if god people weren't in there he would never tell him to come out of [Music] y'all understand what i'm saying we are the bride we are the light of the world we have the commission amen to bring them out like like like david man made saul men come into davis kingdom and that's where we are resurrection must be seen in you not just your praise not just your thanksgiving everybody can do that and god said if you refuse to do that he can get the rocks to do it but there's got to be a life people of god i just want to say it's an urgent time we have been slack we've been slow we haven't been reading and studying so my brother will tell you know i i don't know but that's what the spirit of god is telling me and if he's saying it it's true [Music] this is the time ever to pray like you've never prayed before i didn't read all the scriptures but that god would cause you to escape he would count you worthy to escape nobody wants to go to hell and nobody want to be left behind you have no idea what it's going to be like think about the people of pompeii what happened to them you know they had a voice you know somebody had to tell them because god judgment comes warning comes before judgment hallelujah like in the days of noah they were told in the days of sodom they were told in the days of capernaum they were told but because they ignored the warning hallelujah but you remember when titus came through jerusalem there were those who heard jesus and they got out of the city but everybody that didn't get out of the city had to face the wrath of god by way of titus and the in the history tell us that it got so bad that the people in jerusalem was eating bark off the tree and when they couldn't do that they began to eat their children [Music] so america and the world is now coming into that place where you're gonna have food shortages and everything else y'all understand what i'm saying you're gonna need faith if you ain't got it now hallelujah right now to prepare yourself for what's to come we don't know how long the bride is going to be here before it all i i see things but i'm saying as a whole we must make ourselves greater now [Music] is it that's little song i was lost contrary to god's word but by his grace i heard the spoken word it quickened my soul and it gave [Music] he's the one that called me out of satan's [Music] he's the one time no more will never be living in eternity [Music] he's the one that gave his work with a child he quickened my soul and he gave me eternal life he's the one that called me out of state of system he's the one saying [Music] [Music] i just can't remember it the way it was but that was the essence of it i thank god for his goodness i thank god for allowing us to be here tonight if there'd be any questions anything that i said i'd be more than happy to explain it or tell it i know we have a different people here this morning but i'm gonna tell you something i gave the best of my years to a system [Music] a system of laws and rules oh yeah we had the shout we had the dance it was wonderful [Music] but in years time i began to lose i i found out that the shouting wasn't good sufficient enough even i spoke in tongues and you know god bless me with a little gift of interpretation but i found out that when i needed strength that wasn't good that didn't hold yeah y'all hear what i'm saying oh there was nobody who could dance like me matter of fact [Music] the funny part about this is that i danced when i was in the methodist church the only church i didn't dance in was the catholic danced in the apostolic church i hope this is okay i'm not trying to hurt anybody but i want you to search yourself i want you to look deep in your hearts and your mind and says lord if we're supposed to be the word and these things are supposed to be happening to us all the day i have miracles every day something god shows me that's not natural but supernatural almost every time all the time so what i'm trying to say is that if god is in me why why i can't love like i shouldn't why do i let these things bother me the way they do it lord when when fear why how come fear overtake me when those saints of old that had the genuine holy ghost didn't even fear the lions same holy ghost right searching your heart i believe brother simmons is a true man of god i know he is i don't have to believe that and i know one thing for certain he he has done a great work on earth here i i've i've seen his work i've seen what god has done through it or not i'm not boasting a man i'm saying what i'm seeing god do in him and to do what he's doing now that that's god because a lot of people would not have it but he's being led by god and all of us are here and why are we here not just to have a good time this is the age of the rapture this is a time to change this is the time for christ that you and i grow up into him this is what he wants if i were you i wouldn't let these moments pass me by but he's talking about my church no i'm talking about everybody's church because church is not the thing that saves you only jesus christ in the blood of the lamb you love the lord [Music] how we'll let you go after this song can i say thanks for the things you've done for me things so undeserved [Music] yet you get to prove your love to me the voices of a million angels cannot express my gratitude [Music] all that i am [Music] and ever hope to be [Music] to god be the glory let us [Music] [Music] just let me live my life and let it be pleasing lord today and if should i gain any praise let it flow together [Music] he [Music] oh be the glory to god be the glory to god be the glory [Music] always remember god interprets his own word and when god interprets his word it's not always the way you think it's going to be [Music] that's just the way god has always been they needed a savior he sent them jesus a baby in a manger they couldn't accept it but that was god's interpretation of isaiah's prophecy [Music] praise god god is good amen we appreciate the word we appreciate brother brooks in the slave of love praise god we know sometimes when it comes down to the end folks get a little tired a little weak but i thank god him and allowing the lord to use him thank god for everyone the pressure way the brothers that worked so diligent and so hard even before the meeting started and just working in labor and with the equipment and all that they do the sisters with the food we thank god for everyone um them that labor they meant to make these meetings possible and to help [Music] aid us in the gospel we thank god again larry is normal he always clothes us so by the grace of god we thank god for pastor larry nichols his wife amen raise your hand sister praise god thank the lord for her amen praise god we appreciate them amen appreciate them more than i can say amen but god knows amen we're going to brother uh nick pastor nichols to come he's going to bless the food and he's going to dismiss us in his own way amen so he has the liberty amen if you're not repented of your sins been baptized in water in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin if god touch your heart do you know if he dealt with your heart today if god dealt with your heart and you said i i i god spoke to me and you need that [Music] walk with god and you want to make that commitment to god you need to be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin you need the baptism of the holy ghost brother and sister amen as our pastor nicholas come in his own way i want you to know you could come and you won't pray you would need
