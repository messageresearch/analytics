[31:12] go to
[31:14] Romans

[31:26] and the last days
[31:30] well holy
[31:33] women holy
[31:36] women it's a it's a
[31:39] scarce amount of people that women that
[31:42] are
[31:44] holy but to them that are
[31:48] holy thought about
[31:50] proverbs maybe I I let let me
[31:55] just maybe I come back to Romans let's
[31:58] just go to Proverbs somebody just prayed
[32:01] hard that I didn't do
[32:05] that Proverbs
[32:12] 3110 Proverbs
[32:17] 3110 holy
[32:21] women which is a a round
[32:26] Bunch almost
[32:29] in holy women and holy men and but we're
[32:33] not talking about men this morning we're
[32:35] talking about holy
[32:36] women are y'all all
[32:39] right everybody feel all
[32:42] right praise
[32:44] God God is good
[32:47] amen don't be sad this is time to
[32:50] Rejoice amen you're not glad brother
[32:53] Frank good to see you
[32:56] brother thank you Jesus
[33:01] God is good amen
[33:07] amen Proverbs when we talk about
[33:13] um the natural types the spiritual we're
[33:18] talking about holy
[33:20] women when you talk about holy you you
[33:23] you really think think about people
[33:25] that's Sanctified for
[33:29] God said be holy for I'm
[33:32] holy you're talking about a a person
[33:35] that has been set
[33:37] apart not like the rest of the women
[33:41] we're talking about holy
[33:43] women amen we're saying Mother's
[33:47] Day amen we realize that every everybody
[33:52] that has children is not a mother
[33:59] that's why I said we're talking about
[34:01] mother
[34:04] nature and when we talk about Mother's
[34:07] nature we're talking about not made by
[34:12] man the natural of the nature a
[34:17] natural you're not trying to make
[34:21] something that ain't there
[34:24] there so by the grace of God we talking
[34:27] about something that you don't have to
[34:30] uh work up on you know you
[34:34] got natural plants that natural trees
[34:39] and then you got artificial
[34:43] flowers are you with
[34:45] me something that amen look real but it
[34:49] ain't
[34:52] real are you with
[34:55] me so we have artificial
[34:59] Christians and we have real
[35:02] Christians we got people
[35:07] that claim to be a mother but the
[35:12] nature is not
[35:14] there I was coming to church this
[35:16] morning and as I was coming I listened
[35:19] to the radio and preacher was
[35:22] saying and I didn't know how it would
[35:24] fit he said that uh there was a man had
[35:28] raised uh I guess sheep and he had one
[35:32] that
[35:33] always somehow stray away from the rest
[35:36] of the sheep always getting in trouble
[35:39] and I mean just getting just just won't
[35:41] stay with the rest of the flock and just
[35:44] always uh giving a whole lot of
[35:47] problem so he said he built a little
[35:51] thing to put him in and he put put him
[35:54] in there somehow the way he digged out
[35:57] and and get out of that so no kind of
[35:59] way he could keep the the sheep in the
[36:03] in the fold just give trouble all the
[36:05] time but he say something happened to
[36:08] that
[36:09] sheep some of y'all know the story said
[36:12] the Sheep got
[36:17] pregnant and when the Sheep got
[36:20] pregnant you know it probably had to
[36:23] hold up a little while but when she had
[36:29] the what you call the Sheep they had
[36:32] Lambs or
[36:34] what he didn't say that but we had a
[36:36] baby or
[36:38] whatever and uh but after
[36:43] that after having the
[36:45] CH the baby still couldn't keep the
[36:51] Sheep still running all on still going
[36:54] all about wow
[36:58] guess what happened he
[36:59] said the man couldn't handle the sheep
[37:02] and the Sheep wouldn't make a good
[37:04] mother got what he decided to
[37:07] do kill it she even e
[37:12] it so he said it just won't make no
[37:15] mother and it's a bag on the rest of
[37:17] them see what I'm
[37:21] saying
[37:23] now we have many stories
[37:27] but if we talking about holy women
[37:29] talking about a

[1:16:34] put inside of you and that is his holy
[1:16:38] spirit that will line you up with the
[1:16:42] word the holy spirit gives you the
[1:16:45] ability to live the word without the
[1:16:49] Holy Spirit you cannot be a holy
[1:16:52] woman are you with me
[1:16:55] and the Bible talks about holy
[1:16:57] Brethren considered the Apostle and high
[1:17:00] priest of our confession are you with me

[1:17:37] Sarah praise God the way she treated
[1:17:41] Abraham she obeyed him even in the
[1:17:46] midst of times that look like Abraham
[1:17:51] why you telling me to do this
[1:17:55] say that you're my
[1:17:57] sister you know
[1:18:02] H
[1:18:03] Abraham but she
[1:18:08] obeyed the Bible says who against hope
[1:18:11] believed in
[1:18:13] hope God gave Sarah a
[1:18:17] child
[1:18:19] amen 90 years
[1:18:21] old and God changed their bodies back to
[1:18:25] young are you with
[1:18:28] me what if she would have obeyed Abraham
[1:18:31] you think she would ever had an
[1:18:35] Isaac but because of her
[1:18:37] obedience God blessed
[1:18:40] her brother and sister CU of your
