the neighborhood and those that are classmates and everything pass away so it's so many bereaved families just thank you for coming and thank those that are listening in let's just keep pressing the battle it won't be long When the Roll is called up yeah now I'll be there songs I mean um Isaiah 32 and 1 it says Behold a king shall reign in righteousness Prince charul and judgment and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and I covered from the temptness and as the rivers of water in a dry place as the shadows of a great Rock and a weary land be God listen to each word you may be seated Psalms 18. I mean Proverbs 18 excuse me proverbs 18. proverbs 18. and 10. it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runeth into it and it's safe amen the righteous run into it and Save serving of God's spoken message on letting off depression I was just ministering uh on the precious the pressure of life you know the pressure of life life has this pressure amen you know sometimes people want to get around pressure and sometimes we look at precious sometimes it comes in the form of sometime trouble trouble isn't when you're in trouble it puts pressure on you you know I uh most everybody I mean even little children small children dealing with hypertension and high blood pressure and you see the that there are so many people that are dealing with high blood pressure and sometimes they tell you to don't eat pork and stay away from Salt and do this and that but same as though sometimes all that you do then pressure is still there because he meant there are so many things that of spiritually and physically cause pressure mentally cause pressure so we're dealing with pressure this morning how do we relieve the pressure how do we let off depression amen because it's very I can be less the pain I can we deal with the discomfort and we're in the calls pressure and you can't hardly find many people that's not worried about something if it's not one thing it's another the causes of folks to be weary amen but here the scripture says a rock in a weary land talking about we have a Rock Amen and it's very prevalent that we try to escape pressure we think that we can do something about it but brothers and sisters you're born in a world and coming and the mother goes through pain in childbirth and the Bible tells us man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble so how can you get around pressure when Trouble Comes amen we find yourself amen under pressure relieving the pressure the book of um Peter first Peter five first Peter 5. and seven God is good [Music] Hallelujah we'll in a very Tech Society world that's full of tension serving to God said you're going on the street and people are racing and people are going off somebody cut in front of them and they want nowadays he was talking about back then nowadays folks will shoot you they're going to kill you you cut it in front of them don't take somebody to Park Place a parking place and didn't see them you might be dead you said I I I you try to explain I didn't oh nope you can't even explain it I was waiting on that parking place and you got in there and you didn't see them you just came around the corner and when it didn't know the other car was waiting over your other side honey are you with me so people are under pressure pressure causes us to respond in certain ways it's causing them to do certain thing because of pressure saying that we wouldn't normally do but under pressure you know we say the Christian is built for pressure see uh you have a you know certain things that you have to pressurize in order for them to function properly and uh that's talking about the pro the brothers Gerald with his guns and those things in order to fire right is suppression but if it's not built right the thing can explode on you backfire it's something if they don't build it right the housing and so forth in it right that thing can backfire on you blow up in your face are you so Amen in order for things not to explode on you and blow up on you it's got to be pressurized right are you with me it's got to be built properly and right can no shortcuts about it are you a man praise God so a lot of things a lot of Christians amen they blow up under pressure praise God and we have a problem because people are blowing up and they're supposed to be built for the pressure are you with me can't deal with it so many Christians they own all types of medication because they can't deal with pressure they're with mental pressure all kind of pressure to take an appeal for this and appear for that and a Christian ought to be built for pressure you know subconsciously I told a young man the other day he's in the hospital and you know with heart attack and I said it's underlying issues sometimes pressure is on you you had a heart attack in his 30s and I said it's pressure on your young man he said physically everything starts our athlete and everything boxer and all of that wrestler or whatever but Prussia can cause heart trouble young people going out with heart attacks because of pressure you know some folk just can't be nice some folks are just built to be rugged and hard but sometimes you got to be let off that pressure be loving and kind and understanding and compassionate amen don't let other people problems become your problems see a lot of times we have pressure because we worry about all the folks family members and loved ones and that we got the pressure on us because we're so concerned and care so much about them and their problems till we are carrying their problems the Bible said value one another burden but you got to know amen be built to bear you got to know amen if there's a bottom you got to know where you can take your burdens take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there amen you got to know that I can take my burdens to the Lord amen knocking amen hallelujah I don't have to carry the Lord praise God when you're bad one another burdens you got something to Bear them with you're able to even have to bear one another burden here it says in First Peter 5 and 7. he said cast all your cares upon what him for he what he cares for you are you with me see we we the reason why amen we are under so much tense and so much pressure because we don't carry everything To God In Prayer amen we said he said cast all cast your cares upon him because he cares for you but the reason why we don't do it because we don't believe he can handle it if we know that he can handle amen then we can cast our cares upon them our problems our condition Our concern amen oh God our pains our trouble we can catch them upon him because he cares for us are you up man God can handle amen your condition your problem the thing that you can go into he can harm it all you got to do is trust him with it yes Lord but we won't trust him but we'll amen we'll take another smoke and we become chain smokers amen because we're dealing with something amen that causes us to smoke it's Amen pressured pressure cause you to smoke one cigarette after another pressure cause you to go get a drink when you don't need a drink you need to be able to aim it to trust the Lord let me trust in the Lord with all thy heart to say Lord I'll I'll take my problems to you I'm not I don't want to substitute I I know you're a rock it will relax I will trust the Lord I I'm taking my battles of taking my calves and I'm gonna say Lord I know you can I know you will handle my situation sometimes we we like doing that so some folks return unto the psychiatrists and the psychiatrists got problems and and the psychiatrist is tense and trouble and we'll turn Amen to the counselors and amen the people that supposed to be able to help us they need help return Amen to the medication and the medication the more you got the more you need and the more you want but it does not settle the problem this does not answer amen depression does not take away the pressure but I need something to relieve the pressure the pressures of life and these relief from the pressures of life God I need help somebody said he's the present here Amen in the time of trouble oh yes I can depend on God I can trust him now I know that he can help me now but I got to be willing to cast my cares upon Him I got to be willing to trust him with my situation Lord amen oh God I want my life oh God is in your hand and I want to say Lord I want to surrender my life to you I want to touch you with my life oh I can't handle I cannot bear these burdens alone amen I need you Jesus the Bible these burdens that I'm carving the Lord that you have it for me life struggles is too hard for me God I need relief God I need help help me Lord are you willing to let him know but you know the Bible says here in Peter we must humble ourselves before we can come to God he said humble yourself under the mighty hand of God amen see it takes a humility it meant that we can go to God and we realize that Lord and if I go to him I've got to humble myself down I got to admit that I need help lord I can't hand it but when you put your hand in God's hand you're gonna have to know that he can have this that you got to have enough faith and confidence amen amen in God that said God I tried to talk to her I tried the medicine but Lord I know that you were God you made me know all about me God you can help me I'm coming to you Lord amen I got pressure Lord the pressure of life little children on depression seem to be all tensed up the school got up under pressure life struggles family troubles in the home got the children in pressure sometimes uh amen there's one parent trying to reach children and that's pressure sometimes there's two parents but they're going

nest up and see on the pressure everybody's under pressure everywhere you turn this pressure people seem to be tense where's that calmness in that peace where can I find relief where can I find the calmness and atmosphere where I could calm down the place amen a safety for the Bible said the name of the Lord is a strong tower for the rights and run into it and they are saved we need to find a place praise God that we can get away from our troubles amen I'm so glad that there's a place that has a a a place I can go somebody said I can go to the Rock amen I can go to the Rock Amen because I

power in the name of Jesus I said Jesus Hallelujah I call Jesus somebody said we got to call Jesus on the scene amen we got to call him we got to wake him up you got to cry Jesus amen they tried to
