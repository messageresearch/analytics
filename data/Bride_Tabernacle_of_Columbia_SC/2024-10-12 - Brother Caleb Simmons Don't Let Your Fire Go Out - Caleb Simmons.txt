and your presence be in this place Lord and just continue to touch your people and Lord speak a word in the season of need in Jesus name we pray and amen amen if you got your Bibles tonight we'll turn to the Book of Leviticus Leviticus chapter 6 Leviticus chapter 6 and we'll start in verse I think they got it right verse eight and the Lord spake unto Moses saying command Aaron and his son saying this is the law of the burnt offering it is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night until the morning and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it and the priest shall put on his linen garment and his linen breaches shall he put upon his flesh and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the Altar and he shall put them beside the Altar and he shall put off his garments and put on other garments and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it and it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn the wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it and it shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings the fire shall ever be burning upon the Altar and it shall never go out amen God bless you reading of this word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled don't let your fire go out amen don't let your fire go out and you see here in the in the scripture you see that he commanded them in verse 13 and said the fire shall ever be burned upon the Altar and it shall never go out and I started thinking about a fire and how you go about building this fire and I and I thought about I said wrote something I said sometimes you can use the wrong fuel for your fire bless sometimes you can use the wrong fuel for your fire and when you use the wrong fuel it causes things to happen to your fire it causes things to happen to your fire if you go take some wet wood and put it on a fire Your Fire won't burn the same amen if you go to take some green wood that ain't dried out and you put it on your fire it won't burn the same so what are you using to build your fire what are you using to build your fire and I encourage you to not let your fire go out he said that's what they can they they com they the Lord commanded them to never let the fire go out so is your fire diming see when your fire starts to dim you can't see as well as you used to you can't you're not warm as well as you might have been when it was cold because your fire is dying out you're not the things that's keeping you from from from seeing what you need to see is no longer there cuz your fire is dying out the things that you that that wasn't attacking you before can come closer because your fire was is dying out the animals that was in the woods when you don't have a fire they can come right up to you and they may be there to harm you but when you got a big fire they not coming near because the fire is there the Bible says let your light so shine see when you got that light shining others ain't coming near because it might expose them but if you ain't got no light they can come right up next to you they can come right up next to you cuz they feel comfortable being next to you cuz there's nothing to deter them from being next to you cuz you don't have no light you don't have no fire that if they get close they going to get burned if they get close they going to realize it's not you but it's something that's greater than you it's something that's greater that than you that's standing next to you see that's what fire does it it illuminates you that's what fire does it keeps you it keeps you warn there's a presence when fire is there there's a presence when fire when you are near fire you can tell you can tell when you near fire you might say you know what I'm going to play with the fire I was telling someone I said you know what sometimes it may not be you playing with fire but it might be someone else would you stand next to someone that was playing with fire would you stand next to someone that was playing with fire but sometimes you do it every single day amen cuz you say that's my friend but you know that they playing with fire you might not be but you but you know that they are but you stand right next to them and sometimes and God sometimes he has to show you that listen where they going you don't want to go that's right you can have the fire in you or you can face it one day see which fire do you want cuz the fire that's in you can take you to a whole another place but when you got to face that fire there ain't no escaping it one way or another you going to touch fire one way or another and there's no escaping the fire that's coming the wrath of God that's coming and he said that you can go up or you can go down but one one of the ways you going to have to get some fire cuz fire is there to cleanse you the fire does nothing but cleanse you when they light when a wi fire comes it destroys everything it destroys everything that's in his path everything that's not rock or concrete and that's solid it destroys it and there ain't nothing that you can do about it when the Fire gets hot enough it'll destroy that see sometimes is your fire hot enough is your fire big enough that it can scare away the devil when he comes near if you just got a Candlestick that ain't scaring nobody sometimes you got to build a big fire but but but what are you building your fire work with sometimes your actions speak louder than your words that's right you got big words but you ain't got no actions behind them you say a lot and you say I believe this and that but you ain't got no actions behind them and the devil just sitting there watching you he said I hear you but he didn't move cuz there was no actions that you put behind the words that you spoke I said you might have been praying I said you might not have been praying like you used to see when the fire start dimming you got to ask the question what's wrong when the fire start dying you got to ask the question what's wrong in my life because when when you in tune with God your fire is bright and it's burning and you ain't got to tell other people that God is with me cuz he's right there with you and people know when they look at you they say yeah they know the Lord they ain't coming to you to talk about gossip they coming to ask for prayer so when the conversation changed what changed with you uhhuh cuz the person that came to ask for prayer is not talking about everybody which you something had to change something had to change was it because your fire got dim on was it because your light just got a D I didn't say it was gone but every now and again when you got a fire that's them you got to go poke the fire you got to go poke the fire and then you got to put a new log on it and you got to get that fire to burn it again so you can feel it again so that heat will come I said you might not have been fasting or reading your Bible as in times past see there's things that can help your fire build there's things that you can do to help your fire grow there's things that that you can take place where you know that that that those meetings and those times with God they real and you can see that fire burn you can see the effects of the fire say what is your fire affec cuz when fire is there it has an effect I don't care whe whether it's a small one or a big one you touch it it's going to have an effect if you get close to it it's going to have an effect I said and the small things that didn't bother you as much bother you more now when your fire get them those little small things that you thought that was over they come and they start bothering you that's right cuz that fire is no longer there to protect prot you that fire is no longer there to protect you and even when you getting close if the fire is small it's not doing the same thing so when you got a big fire you can stand way away from it and feel the heat if you ever l a grill and use the wrong um use the wrong thing when it when you light it and it jump off you jump back right why cuz that heat is intense I've done it before so yeah but the heat is intense and when the heat is intense you ain't got to be close to it to feel the fire but when it's a little small fire you got to stand right next to it and you got to hover over it and hopefully you feel something but then in that moment that's time to feed it cuz you never want the fire to die because it's hard starting a cold fire oh yes it's hard starting a cold fire when you don't have the ingredients that you need to start that fire it's another thing to feed the fire even if the fire Get Low I can feed it and I know it to jump back up I can feed the fire but when the fire die it's hard to start that fire it's hard to start a cold fire cuz you got to go against the elements you got to go against everything that is against you to light that fire again and to light that fire again I guarantee you once you get it lit you don't want it to go back out that that once you get that fire lit you don't want it to go back out because it took you too much to overcome to get that fire lit but if you got fire inside of you you got to feed that fire so that it won't die so that you won't have to go through the struggles and the battles to get that fire relit in your life if you're waning in your faith this is the time to pick it up and say Lord I Need My Fire to be rekindled I need you to put some accelerant on this fire amen so that I can feed this fire and this fire can continue to grow it's not a time to stop and slow down it's a time to build the fire cuz the bigger your fire eventually when I come into the house of the Lord with my fire and you got your fire eventually we can have a big old fire and the devil can't stand in the way of it but if you ain't got no fire now I got to try to light your fire with mine and you wonder why sometime the song leader struggle the Breer struggle is because you ain't have no fire thank you Jesus but when your fire is there and you walk in with your fire it's a whole totally different atmosphere cuz it doesn't matter what the preacher say don't matter what the song Leaders sing you going to enter into worship and say Lord I Thank you for lighting My Fire Lord I Thank you for building my fire and keeping me in tune with the fire that you gave me this week amen see God has a way to continue to build your fire he has a way of continue to make sure that your fire is growing amen amen but you have the authority and the power sometime to figure out whether you want your fire to die or not cuz you can stop your fire from growing sometimes you can go over there and say Lord I don't want you to illuminate this I throw some water on it Lord I don't want you to touch tou this I'm going to throw some water on say God don't leave you but you can leave him amen and sometimes it's real strategic when you leave them Lord cuz you afraid of what God is about to do bless you afraid of what God is about to show you you afraid cuz you know it's right around the corner you know what's around the corner sometimes nobody else knows what you know and if God to build that fire either something going to happen or you going to have to do something that you don't want to do Lord so you will throw some water on that fire and think that God ain't see you wonder wonder why it's starting to get cold and people asking you why is it getting cold cuz they can see it that fire ain't the same that fire ain't as bright as it used to be and they can see that that's right and they coming to ask you what's wrong you say everything okay but God sees it amen he saw what you did Jesus but you had the ability to say Lord forgive me Lord I want you to rekindle and grow my fire again and it's not too late he gives us each an opportunity yes he does said as much sometimes you got to go to the Lord and say Lord I'm sorry and thank you for your grace and mercy am am you're rich in grace and mercy prophet of God said he said when you let the fire go out we're sinking I wonder did Peter's fire go out when he was walking on the sea he started to look at all the storms and all this and he started sinking said when when you let the fire go out we start sinking he said and sometimes you go and you think that the painted fire is good enough for me I can see it I imagine I'm feeling heat but you're slowly dying you're slowly dying cuz you're only looking at a picture you're only looking at something that used to be but ain't present you're only looking at something that that happened but not what's happening now cuz you you looking at that but you ain't realizing that your fire is gone cuz it's a beautiful picture what happened was a beautiful thing and you can look at it but there's no Warth coming from it he said how can a freezing man get warn by a painted fire how can a starving man eat from a painted picture of food if God is not a man who will enti and tantalized with some painted picture what what the Holy Ghost was then what Jesus Christ was then he is now that's true that's what he say just the same as he was then the same yesterday today and forever certainly we just need the fire let the fire goes out in your church brother and the church is gone that's right when your fire go dies part of the church dies but you don't look at it in the whole thing you just saying I just want to do what I want to do but it has an effect and when you cold sometimes I'm taking my branches to light you eventually I run out of branches because I'm I'm over here trying to light your fire amen trying to make sure that you all right trying to make sure that you okay but I'm I'm over here carrying things that ain't even mine but how does your fire look see at a certain point in time you got to come and say it's on you not on me it's on you it's not on me while your fire ain't out it's on you and not on me and when you realize that you say Lord I I hey I can't worry about your fire going out cuz mine going out that's right mine going out lord it's so cold in here that mine's going out Lord I need you to Light My Fire some more Lord I need you to rekindle My Fire Lord I need that explosion of the holy ghost in my life that that that fire can continue to go and burn sometimes you got to get to that point Lord I got to leave you alone and go by myself until until that fire can grow and grow and grow until I a I just got to walk near you walk in the other direction cuz you feel the heat I ain't even got to be near you but you feel the heat see that's the type of fire that you want where the devil see you coming and say I got to go the devil see you coming say uhuh I ain't getting burned today but if your fire ain't there he'll be right there next with you conversating with you having a wonderful time laughing and joking and say hey that's my best friend if your best friend is the biggest devil you know you got a problem sir you got a problem if you said that person had a problem and now they your best friend I and you know the Lord ain't delivering Then I then I'm wondering what's wrong with you that's all right cuz the fire must have die the fire had to dim down for them to be comfortable around you but don't let your fire go out cuz when you let it go out the devil can get near you the things that you struggle with used to they can come back and get closer to you that's right that don't mean you going to fall but they'll get closer to you and when you see that come and you say I got to reexamine my fire I got to reexamine my fire I got to re examine and see where I am with my fire got to stop looking at this one and that one because I'm looking at them but I ain't paying attention to my fire I'm paying attention to theirs and paying attention to this one and that but my fire is dying amen say I got I can't let my fire die I can't let the things that God gave me see the trick is the thing is you didn't like this Fire come on bro if you had lit the fire see in the Bible here they said that they didn't like this fire he said don't let it die that's right it didn't say that they lit the fire he said Don't Let the Fire Die they was there to maintain that fire they was there to make sure that fire every single day they put wood on the fire and they took out the ashes that mean that something died if you got ashes something had had to be disintegrated the fire did something they removed the Ashes to make sure the fire had oxygen made sure that fire could breathe when was the last time you let go of all your dirt and let the Lord have it when was the last time you took out all the dirt and gave it to the Lord and that was it so your fire could breathe your fire can't breathe if it don't have oxygen but when was the last time you did that and said Lord I give you everything and I Surrender everything and gave it to him so that your fire could breathe when was the last time you picked up your Bible to feed the feed the fire that's right amen Hallelujah see that's what it takes for your fire to be maintained when was the last time you had a conversation with god not went down to asking for stuff but had a conversation with god well you talk to God and he talked back to youen see when you got that fire going that's what happens God will show you stuff before before it come to past you will see things and you will wonder why you know certain things was nothing but God told you but when your fire is burning and it's and it's there you can feel that and you know that God is with me so when that this fire was there they knew they knew that God was there and Samuel they said the lamp it went out and that's when God brought judgment my God but what what what does your fire look like because you got a way of making this fire grow true and and it ain't something that is extraordinary that you got to do it's real simple that what you got to do you got to make sure you got the fire one that's true amen if you ain't got the fire then there's a whole another steps that you got to take to get the fire but once you got the fire once the fire is inside of you are you maintaining it is your fire growing or is in the same place it was when you first got the fight that means that something you put something there to burn that means where the ashes at that's right is it still under the fire did you get to a point that you decided to pour some water on the fire to make sure it didn't grow it didn't get bigger it didn't expand to this area of my life it didn't expand to that area of my life I want the fire to stay right here I only want one room heated in my house that's the room that I'm in so when I leave this room I'm going to shut the door real tight and make sure that all the rest of the house be cold sometime we do god like that Lord you only allow in this room the rest of rooms I got with my stuff all the stuff that I want is in this sometimes God can come down like he did in Elijah and consume it all he can consume it all but he said but he wants you to examine your fire God had to do that cuz they let that fire go they let that fire burn out so he Elijah had to call for the fire to come back down and he had to prove to them that he was God so he said Lord take the fire the stones and the water now we all know that water don't burn that's what you use to you use on a fire to put it out but the Lord had to consume the water too said are you in a place that you can examine your fire each and every one of us have to do do that for ourselves I can't examine your fire you can't examine mine but I can know if it's burning I can know if it's burning if the Lord allow me you to see you can tell if somebody fire you're burning cuz there's results when the fire is burning there's things that happen when the fire is burning when the fire is burning you witnessing you're talking to people you're having conversations about the Lord I can know when your fire is burning cuz I can see the effects of it I can see the effects and it's not something that you put on it's something that's there it's something it ain't something that you trying to make happen and fabricate it's something that's there it's something that people can tell when you walk into the room that's something different they don't know but it's because the fire is burning but are you examining your fire each and every day and say where is my fire what does my fire look like and what is God trying to show me with the fire that I have cuz when when the Lord wants to get your attended he'll show you and sometimes you don't want to look in the mirror to see that it's because of me that my fire is dying amen it's because of me not all the things that's happening to me but it's because of me and when I look at myself and I see that I'm the issue and I'm the problem I can stop looking at everybody else and realize that Lord I got to get closer to you for myself so my fire can grow I got to do the small things that I need to do to be consistent that my
