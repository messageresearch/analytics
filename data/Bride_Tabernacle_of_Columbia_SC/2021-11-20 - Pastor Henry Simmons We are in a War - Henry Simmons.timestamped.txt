[35:11] the book of romans 7 chapter romans 7
[35:17] and 1 romans 7 and 1.
[35:23] it says
[35:27] know you're not brethren
[35:29] for i speak to them that know the law
[35:32] how that the law has dominion over man
[35:34] so long
[35:36] as long as
[35:38] he liveth
[35:40] for the woman which has husband
[35:43] is bound by the law to the hearts man
[35:46] so long as he live it
[35:49] but if the husband be dead
[35:52] she is loosed from the law of
[35:56] her
[35:56] husband
[35:58] so then if
[36:00] why
[36:01] her husband liveth
[36:03] and she and be she be married
[36:06] to another man
[36:09] she shall be called an adulteress
[36:12] but if a husband be dead
[36:15] she is free from the law
[36:18] so that
[36:19] she is no adulteress
[36:22] though she be married to another
[36:24] man wherefore my brethren
[36:28] you also
[36:29] are become dead to the law by the body
[36:33] of christ
[36:35] that ye should
[36:37] be married to another even to him
[36:41] who is raised from the dead
[36:45] that
[36:46] we should bring forth fruit under god
[36:50] may god bless you reader's word you may
[36:52] be seated
[36:58] down a little farther we want to talk
[37:00] about we're in a war or we're in a
[37:02] battle
[37:04] amen
[37:05] sometimes we we talk about a war and we
[37:07] talk about a battle
[37:09] you can be in a lot of battles in
[37:12] in the war
[37:13] you can lose battles but you can win the
[37:15] war
[37:17] so we're in a war we're battling in in a
[37:20] battle amen so he's got plenty battles
[37:23] but one day it'll be the final battle
[37:25] the battle of armageddon
[37:27] that'll be the last battle amen
[37:30] and then
[37:31] the world are coming to his final battle
[37:34] and you and i amen
[37:36] we have plenty of battles through our
[37:38] lives plenty of battles
[37:40] but one day
[37:42] it will come to the final battle
[37:44] praise god
[37:46] where this life here will come to its
[37:48] completion
[37:50] but by the grace of god the world itself
[37:52] will have his final battle
[37:55] amen
[37:56] and we'll see that
[37:58] that battle of armageddon
[38:00] but by the grace of god we know
[38:03] that god has already
[38:06] pronounced victory in the last battle
[38:08] amen
[38:10] just like he said the last enemy that
[38:12] shall be destroyed is death
[38:15] so your last the last enemy amen
[38:20] when death and hell is stowed into the
[38:22] lake of fire and it's no more death
[38:24] no more dying no more crying
[38:26] and he meant it all to be over with then
[38:28] amen
[38:30] i was just sharing some of these things
[38:32] in mullins last night and
[38:34] i don't know how
[38:35] you know
[38:36] it'll come out to
[38:38] tonight
[38:39] because i had brother dwayne reading
[38:41] from me praise god maybe
[38:44] caleb will pick up a mic
[38:46] help me out
[38:47] um seven
[38:49] and fifteen
[38:50] it says for that
[38:52] which i do
[38:54] i allow not
[38:57] for what i would that
[39:00] do i not
[39:03] but what i hate
[39:04] that i do
[39:07] if then i do that which i would not
[39:11] i consent unto the law that it is good
[39:16] now then
[39:18] it is no more i
[39:20] that do it
[39:22] but sin that dwelleth in me
[39:25] for i know that in me
[39:28] that is in my what
[39:31] in my flesh dwelleth what
[39:34] no good thing
[39:36] you know when we talk about we are no
[39:37] good
[39:38] we got the meaning we got to have a
[39:40] revelation
[39:42] i was saying you know
[39:45] probably god talk about the greatest
[39:46] battle ever fought fought within our
[39:48] minds right
[39:50] so we all have mind battles but
[39:54] i was talking about how can you defeat
[39:57] an enemy that you don't see
[40:01] how can you how can you beat the enemy
[40:04] when you don't sin
[40:07] and that's what a lot of times people
[40:10] are losing the battle because they don't
[40:13] see the enemy
[40:15] amen but you got to be able to see your
[40:19] enemy
[40:21] amen
[40:22] and when you're able to see your enemy
[40:26] you can defeat your enemy if you can see
[40:29] it
[40:30] but a lot of times folks see
[40:33] other they're actually seeing what they
[40:35] think
[40:36] with their eyes and their visible amen
[40:39] because and
[40:41] when when they can see it they think
[40:43] that that's my enemy
[40:45] you know people
[40:46] don't really see their
[40:48] you know their enemy
[40:50] they think hey hey i i see what you're
[40:53] doing
[40:54] i heard what you're doing
[40:56] see what i'm saying but i'm talking
[40:58] about really seeing your enemy
[41:00] see most times people miss their enemy
[41:03] and
[41:04] and they think they're so spiritual so
[41:06] holy and so uh godly and all but most
[41:11] most people
[41:12] amen they can't see their enemy and
[41:15] that's why they do so much damage
[41:18] that's why you have so much friendly
[41:20] fire
[41:22] are you with me
[41:23] it's friendly fire they panic and they
[41:26] begin to have friendly fire and they
[41:28] begin to kill those that's on their side
[41:32] so oftentimes in the battle
[41:34] in afghanistan and vietnam and different
[41:36] battles world war one were a lot of
[41:39] times
[41:41] their own
[41:42] [Music]
[41:44] soldiers killed one another
[41:47] and they call it now friendly fire
[41:50] amen and then
[41:52] and you see what has happened out there
[41:54] amen so we got a lot of friendly fire in
[41:57] the church
[41:58] friendly fire
[42:00] your brothers and sisters
[42:02] shooting one another
[42:04] killing one another
[42:06] amen
[42:07] friendly they call it friendly fire
[42:10] but somebody's dead because of friendly
[42:12] fire
[42:13] somebody's crippled because of failing
[42:15] fire
[42:16] somebody's paralyzed because of friendly
[42:18] fire
[42:19] so it's because amen people panic and
[42:23] amen and
[42:25] and they think that they meant the one
[42:27] that's on their side they think that's
[42:29] the enemy
[42:31] so the people amen
[42:33] are not able to see their enemy and
[42:36] because if they can't see the enemy they
[42:38] end up killing one another
[42:42] why because in their mind they they burn
[42:46] it they think that's my enemy and they
[42:47] go
[42:48] far
[42:52] okay
[42:53] so i'm hoping that we'll get there uh i
[42:56] got a little further up the road in
[42:58] mullins but a lot of friendly fire amen
[43:02] we're in a war amen
[43:04] and we're constantly but we got to know
[43:06] our enemy
[43:07] we got to know our enemy because
[43:10] but oftentimes i think that we become so
[43:13] spiritual
[43:15] and so miscritified
[43:18] till we so so far up there till we think
[43:21] we understand and all the time amen we
[43:24] actually don't know we ought to just
[43:26] come down to
[43:27] attack it then come down to god said god
[43:30] here help me
[43:33] because what i think i know i don't know
[43:36] see paul was uh dealing with
[43:39] he said when i decided to do good evil
[43:41] is present with me so i find that the
[43:43] law going on he said when i when i think
[43:46] i'm going i'm doing good then i i'm
[43:49] doing the wrong thing
[43:52] see what i'm saying so paul of an
[43:54] apostle and a great man of god he said
[43:57] man i see something working here
[44:00] amen i see i i see i'm in contact with
[44:03] something working here and that's what
[44:05] happens amen paul realized
[44:08] it meant that it's something what's
[44:10] going on
[44:11] but you know you you can't get no help
[44:13] if you don't think you need no help
[44:16] and you can't get nowhere with god
[44:18] thinking that you already got all you
[44:20] need and know all you know
[44:23] amen
[44:25] you know i i said you know
[44:27] people get
[44:28] intellectual
[44:30] knowing the message intellectually
[44:33] understanding because they're smart
[44:34] people
[44:35] you got a lot of intellectual smart
[44:37] people that think that they have
[44:39] revelation
[44:41] because they intellectual smart people
[44:44] they know how to read and write and they
[44:46] can understand pretty good and if they
[44:48] go to school they'd probably be a b or a
[44:51] student or whatever they'll they'll be
[44:53] above average amen
[44:56] but
[44:56] those people usually don't have
[44:58] revelation they're just smart
[45:01] those preachers that the
[45:02] super teachers and super preachers a lot
[45:05] of times people look at them ah
[45:08] because they're showing their
[45:09] intelligence if they were in school the
[45:11] people would say wow
[45:13] they'll be the professor
[45:15] there'll be doctors so and so on
[45:17] see what i'm saying but people are
[45:19] getting confused intellectual knowledge
[45:21] with revelation
[45:23] amen praise god
[45:26] now it is a revelation to somebody like
[45:28] you know me you know
[45:32] you know because if you're on that level
[45:34] and i'm not on this level
[45:39] even in the natural
[45:41] you know
[45:43] i i couldn't understand how some people
[45:45] couldn't get the you know the problems
[45:47] right some folks go through school and
[45:49] don't know the timetables
[45:52] you said seven seven times seven
[45:58] nine times nine
[46:03] you got it right marion mary
[46:06] you ain't got it that quick
[46:09] see you had to learn that by the time
[46:10] you was in second grade third grade you
[46:13] had that
[46:15] back in our day
[46:17] and some people just couldn't get it
[46:20] now you don't have to think like that
[46:23] we had to
[46:24] they said boom boom and we got
[46:26] it square root of the square root of
[46:29] that boom boom boom you got it
[46:31] some people what is the scrap root i
[46:33] don't know
[46:34] but then the other people could spell
[46:37] these big words
[46:39] and i'm looking at huh
[46:42] you know
[46:44] teacher give them
[46:45] give me a little word
[46:48] there
[46:49] there there
[46:51] they there
[46:53] i don't know which one the day or day i
[46:54] might put down that date and they said
[46:57] there i said oh
[46:59] i'm all confused
[47:01] so
[47:02] but with math
[47:03] it was clicking you see what i'm saying
[47:06] but if something comes there to you
[47:09] that you can flow in a certain area
[47:12] and god the prophet god said the devil
[47:14] has one area
[47:17] one spot he can get you in
[47:19] are you with me
[47:21] so we all got a a place where the devil
[47:23] could really but if you don't ever find
[47:25] out what your weakness is with that spot
[47:28] if you don't never find it out you think
[47:30] you're all right cause you ain't got
[47:31] that spot i'm gonna tell you something
[47:34] your family members a lot of times tell
[47:36] you where that spot is because using
[47:38] this
[47:39] it runs down through the genes
[47:44] and you can you can look at a family
[47:45] member you say oh
[47:47] yeah that's that spot that usually is
[47:50] certain traits that you have
[47:52] amen
[47:54] that are natural treats
[47:56] that ain't good and ain't helpful for
[47:58] you
[47:59] and then
[48:01] and through the spiritual genes of god
[48:04] is the divine nature of god
[48:06] and it has its characteristics
[48:09] are you a man
[48:10] and god is identified by his own
[48:12] characteristics are you are you look man
[48:15] i'm getting off on some things but we
[48:17] must understand because you got to know
[48:20] your enemy you
[48:22] amen a lot of us are not con we don't
[48:25] we're not understanding our own self we
[48:28] don't understand why we go through
[48:30] certain things and why we are battling
[48:33] in certain areas we don't understand if
[48:36] we could only uh you know settle down i
[48:39] was talking to a sister the other day
[48:40] and she was telling me about
[48:42] but but by the child or whatever and
[48:44] then i i started telling her you know
[48:47] i said this is so and so on and this and
[48:50] so and so on i says you know i learned a
[48:53] lot of stuff
[48:54] from my daughter rachel
[48:56] because she teach special ed
[48:59] and so rachel would tell me daddy you
[49:01] got certain things that we learned in
[49:03] school you already got them you know
[49:06] i said well i didn't learn he said she
[49:08] said i know you don't know it in school
[49:09] but you the lord bless you like that
[49:13] but but i learned a lot from her just
[49:15] talking to her you know what i'm saying
[49:18] so by the grace of god a lot of times
[49:20] you know nobody diagnoses your case
[49:23] so lord you know just let me i said let
[49:26] me tell you this
[49:27] about your daughter i mean i don't know
[49:29] her i said so and so and so and so on
[49:32] she said
[49:34] i said
[49:35] she needed help when she was a little
[49:37] small
[49:38] she needed help
[49:42] she needed this and she needed that
[49:46] she said ah
[49:48] how come
[49:49] nobody told us
[49:51] you see what i'm saying see
[49:53] a lot of things if you can catch
[49:55] before it get big
[49:58] amen but a lot of times
[50:00] we we we
[50:03] we we got to pray
[50:05] and be keen
[50:06] and god open sometimes god even if you
[50:09] saw it sometimes you can't help
[50:11] because sometimes people patterns of
[50:13] their life they have to go certain ways
[50:16] it has to go somewhere you can't change
[50:18] destiny
[50:21] you can't change what's ordained
[50:24] amen even though you see it
[50:27] but it's good that you know when you can
[50:29] see
[50:30] and you can try to deal with it and try
[50:32] to help
[50:33] if you can see and a lot of folk can't
[50:35] see because they can't help you because
[50:37] they can't see what you need help
[50:41] but the reason why most folks don't get
[50:43] help because they don't think they need
[50:45] help
[50:47] it don't matter how much a wife try to
[50:50] help a husband husband hard-headed thing
[50:52] he pulled to be the balls he pulled to
[50:53] be the head and she can try to help her
[50:56] uh or vice versa
[50:59] and in the marriage always a chaos and
[51:01] confusion because one one won't listen
[51:04] to the other
[51:08] instead of let one help the other
[51:11] because
[51:12] you know
[51:13] if anybody gonna see you it'll be your
[51:14] husband or your wife
[51:17] you know what i'm saying they'll see one
[51:18] another folks
[51:20] but if we got to hum ourselves down i
[51:23] have to listen to renee and she has to
[51:26] listen to me and sometimes i'm still
[51:28] going to be hard-headed
[51:30] you see what i'm saying
[51:31] but
[51:32] there is a communication and she's
[51:35] always trying to help me
[51:37] amen
[51:39] and that
[51:40] but i got to be open i got to pray and i
[51:42] got to humble myself to get help
[51:45] are you with me
[51:47] and a lot of times
[51:48] it
[51:50] sometimes we don't even listen
[51:53] so how we gonna get help if we don't
[51:54] even listen
[51:57] because we figure well i already heard
[51:59] that already if you're here then you
[52:01] don't do no better
[52:04] are you with me
[52:06] so by the grace of god
[52:08] god
[52:09] oh
[52:10] let me get off of that
[52:11] i don't know
[52:13] but by the grace of god there's a wall
[52:15] there's a battle going on
[52:17] you got to know your enemies now
[52:20] now you know
[52:22] the the worst enemy you got is you
[52:28] yourself isn't that right
[52:31] now the worst enemy but most of the time
[52:35] you are so worried about some outside
[52:39] force
[52:40] to you not really seeing yourself
[52:44] you know what we spent our time worrying
[52:47] about
[52:48] uh what other folk are doing or what
[52:51] other folks are going through what other
[52:53] folks did or what other and we always
[52:56] just running off our mouths and worrying
[52:58] about this and worrying about god
[53:01] talking about this and talking about
[53:02] that and when
[53:04] we invite shape ourselves
[53:08] we need help ourselves
[53:10] instead of looking at god show me myself
[53:15] and uh you know it it it
[53:19] it it gets to me sometimes
[53:22] because
[53:24] the wall let me let me get me killed
[53:27] well i'll stop here
[53:29] i got to read this before i get too far
[53:31] gone
[53:32] where i can get my scripture content
[53:35] it's like
[53:37] 18
[53:38] 18 read it again now
[53:40] for i know that in me that is in my
[53:43] flesh dwell is no good thing
[53:46] for to will is present with me
[53:49] okay for the will is present with me
[53:52] but how to perform that which is good i
[53:55] find not
[53:56] okay i you know you all of us as
[53:59] christians we want to do right but how
[54:01] to perform it
[54:02] you know how to perform it we want to do
[54:05] it
[54:06] that's why a lot a lot of times people
[54:08] say well so-and-so didn't say they
[54:10] didn't mean to do that that's why the
[54:11] prophet said when the man was saying all
[54:14] kind of stuff about the prophet he said
[54:15] he didn't mean to do it because the
[54:17] prophet look at it you know
[54:19] anybody look at the person said i don't
[54:21] know he don't mean that you know what
[54:23] i'm saying oh
[54:25] but they try to convince the prophet
[54:26] that yeah yeah yeah oh he said he didn't
[54:29] mean that i forgive him he said that was
[54:31] a trial named before the foundation of
[54:33] the world that he had to go through
[54:36] see what i'm saying but if you look at
[54:37] it instead of you looking at it as your
[54:40] enemy the prophet of god said you know i
[54:43] forgive him he didn't mean it
[54:45] are you a friend
[54:47] he didn't have a brother you said
[54:49] something something about me i'm gonna
[54:50] go tell you a piece of mama he didn't
[54:53] mean it
[54:55] it did not mean it
[54:58] so he didn't worry about it just let it
[55:00] go isn't that right
[55:02] sometimes the things that hurt us the
[55:04] most amen is because we're selfish
[55:09] we're always thinking about our world
[55:12] our feelings
[55:14] you know self
[55:17] so your worst enemy is yourself
[55:20] jesus took something for you and i
[55:24] he went through some agony some pain he
[55:26] went through things see if he went
[55:28] through things for you and i we got to
[55:30] go through things for
[55:34] oh you want me but we're not willing to
[55:36] reverse the thing amen
[55:39] praise god
[55:40] it's all right jesus carry his cross but
[55:42] what about mine
[55:45] are you but we don't want no crowds
[55:48] the suffering goes with raining
[55:52] amen if we want to rain we going to
[55:54] suffer
[55:55] and
[55:56] and the suffering of our present time is
[55:59] not compared to be the glory that shall
[56:01] be revealed where
[56:03] in us
[56:05] god is doing something in us

[1:03:46] evil is present with me go ahead but i
[1:03:48] delight in the law of god after the
[1:03:50] inward man
[1:03:52] but i see another law in my members
[1:03:54] warring against the law of my mind
[1:03:56] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:03:59] sin which is in my members
[1:04:03] you know
[1:04:04] affection memory conscience all of that
[1:04:07] that that stuff will mess you up but
[1:04:09] down in your soul you got to have what
[1:04:12] faith you got to believe you got to
[1:04:14] believe you got to have faith you got to
[1:04:16] be anchored down in the soul the holy
[1:04:18] ghost baptism on your flesh in the

[1:04:27] life is amen that's where you got an
[1:04:29] ankle amen ankle in the soul amen my
[1:04:33] soul has been anchored
[1:04:35] praise god that's where amen faith takes
[1:04:38] amen and it dominates amen and it begins
[1:04:41] to work and bring all of these in
[1:04:44] subjection
[1:04:45] they meant it brings the spirit it
[1:04:47] brings the flesh into objection they
[1:04:50] meant praise god because faith is there
[1:04:52] faith in what faith in the word of god
[1:04:55] amen praise god i'm holding to the word
[1:05:00] hallelujah

[1:05:28] law of god but with the flesh the law of
[1:05:31] sin okay so so by the grace of god
[1:05:36] it's something about
[1:05:38] the the prophet of god says
[1:05:42] you're you're trying to tell god what to
[1:05:45] do
[1:05:46] you know a lot of folks are trying to
[1:05:48] tell god what to do
[1:05:50] they try to tell god god this is what i
[1:05:53] want you to do

[1:13:16] what
[1:13:17] see the kingdom of heaven isn't that
[1:13:19] right
[1:13:20] so you can't fight something you don't
[1:13:21] see
[1:13:23] and the people can't see itself they get
[1:13:25] eyes to see
[1:13:27] and the odds of your understanding got
[1:13:29] to be
[1:13:30] enlightened until you get the holy ghost
[1:13:33] you ain't gonna see
[1:13:35] because you've got to be born again to
[1:13:38] see
[1:13:39] and if you're not born again you blind
[1:13:42] are you what man but thank god amen when
[1:13:45] we received the baptism of the holy
[1:13:48] ghost i couldn't get it because the holy
[1:13:50] ghost is the ghost you don't see a ghost
[1:13:53] until after you die
[1:13:56] are you up man
[1:13:58] praise god you got to get him amen but
[1:14:00] in order to get him that first husband
[1:14:03] got to die
[1:14:05] praise god that carnal way of thinking
[1:14:07] the kind of way of believing amen that
[1:14:10] caught a mind is enmity against god is
[1:14:13] not suffering to the law of god and
[1:14:15] neither indeed can it be
[1:14:17] wait amen we got to get rid of our mind
[1:14:19] we got to be renewed in the mind and god
[1:14:22] to be transformed we got to be changed
[1:14:24] we need the holy ghost we need to be
[1:14:26] born again our eyes amen we can see like
[1:14:30] god sees
[1:14:31] amen praise god when we see like he see
[1:14:34] then we see this old man trying to live
[1:14:37] we got to crucify
[1:14:40] oh when he comes up and try to rise up
[1:14:43] you got to kill it
[1:14:45] let this flesh die not my will but let
[1:14:48] your will be done

[1:15:13] can't see
[1:15:15] you can't see your enemy
[1:15:17] you can't see yourself
[1:15:19] and then you can have the holy ghost but
[1:15:21] if you don't let the holy ghost sweat
[1:15:24] lead you
[1:15:27] come on
[1:15:28] you have a high
[1:15:30] you know the holy ghost said don't do
[1:15:32] that and you
[1:15:33] do
[1:15:34] the holy ghost

[1:15:40] lead you
[1:15:42] amen he'll lead you and he'll guide you
