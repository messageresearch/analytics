come to your house lord and lord to come before your people lord we know god in me that is in my flesh dwell it's no good thing lord and father we're not even worthy to stand before your people lord lord god because this people oh god your children lord him father we're so unworthy lord of your grace and mercy lord because of your precious grace upon our lives father we stand lord father we know that one day we'd have to answer to you oh god for the things in which we preach lord and father i just pray that the words that we ministered today lord will help your children to draw closer to you lord and lord i pray you move oh god flesh is out of the way god and that you would get glory and praise and lord it will be what you would want your people to know this morning and pray you bless every heart look upon the sick and afflicted lord um the lord sister rachen or julius lord and lord um sister something and then something lord and the different ones oh god uh that action for prayer lord we continue to live oh god your children up on the prayer list lord and lord we know that you will go here and answer prayer lord and father we thank you for doing so in jesus wonderful name we pray amen the book of saint matthew 16 chapter familiar scripture the 24th verse i'll read the first you read the next we'll read the last verse together matthew 16 24 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 25. for what is a man prophet if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul 27. together very literally saying to you there's some of you here we shall not taste it until we see son of man coming in his kingdom may god bless you in this word you may be seated we thank god again for you your patience thank god for each and every every one of the soldiers of the cross those that thought enough about him to be willing to lay down your life for his sake so by the grace of god your presence here today is to say to god lord i'm one of them uh i desire to be one of them in the army of the lord because of your desire to be a christian a soldier for paul's styles as the as a good soldier and that we are in a fight and it's not many people that's fighting you know as brother ernie said the other night there's not many people fighting they're in the army but they're not in it to fight they're in it to be spectators and look homes they don't realize that we're in a war and we're in a battle well you see those that are not desperate in prayer those that not they're not praying because they don't need to pray it's almost we're at peace now everything is going fine we don't need to pray that's the way israel was when everything is going swell and they were prospered it's only when the time of trouble came that they cried to the lord and i'm gonna tell you brother and sister if that's what it takes is that's what god has to do in your life that cause trouble to come then god let trevor come and you wonder why trouble come because that's the only way god's gonna get you when he needs you if trouble don't come you you forget all about him you know so even some things said in the 24 verse he says then said jesus unto the disciples if any man come after me now he was telling you if you're going to come and you're going to follow him or you're going to come after him first of all he says the first thing you've got to do is deny yourself we want to talk about denying yourself the next thing he said you cannot take up your cross until first you deny yourself now many people the reason why they're not taking up the cross because they have not done the first thing they have not denied themselves many people that claim to be followers of jesus christ have not done the first thing there's no time in their christian walk have they come to a place that they denied themselves they went through the outward motion but there was no end with conviction the outward motion that i said the right thing that confess jesus christ as my lord and the savior and i accepted him and i received him but there was nothing in it that caused a real dying out to oneself there was no picking up a cross afterwards for if you do it right if you deny yourself then you're willing to take up the cross but if you haven't done it right then that's never a cross that you ever carry anytime things got tough a little rough and there's a little struggle in the journey look like we thought about my hand and we give up don't take much for us to get in our flesh and and all of that don't play oh lord but if you deny yourself and you take the first approach as a christian you deny yourself first as the prophet god said our greatest enemy and i could have said that as my topic but i use the topic our greatest enemy is ourselves and that's the first thing he asks you to do if you're going to come you got to deny yourself because you he knows that you're your own greatest enemy nobody else on the outside we blame everybody for whatever we're going through and we look for excuse to not look at ourselves the bible said we have not because we ask none it is always somebody else's problem because i'm not spirit i'm not where i need to be things are going on in my life this is happening i don't want to never say it's me it's me oh lord standing in the neither prayer it's me before i can take to talk to y'all about this message i had to let it filter through me sometimes i have to look back over my life and i have to see whether or not i'm fully committed and dedicated to god like i should and then sometimes i see some problems that you know i was telling kelvin johnson seven days a week i think brother gohan was talking about the seven days a week you know i wanted to do something for the lord i wanted to get out in the streets i wanted to talk to somebody about the lord and get out on my knees and pray about it and go in the streets tell somebody about jesus dr caleb and joshua says you're young energetic the first time in your life i said in your life you'll never have this opportunity again so you get married children are coming different things that come up i said but you got the opportunity to give god your all i'm gonna tell you what it the benefits of that i said i want to tell y'all something the benefits is that god will bless your children god will bless your life the wife that you marry it'll be a blessing everything about your life would be a blessing if you would just put god first night the sacrifices you make now amen it'll be a blessing to your children brothers and sisters but see some of us often times we want all the blessings but we don't want to know none of the sacrifices none of the things that god is asking us to do the value of one soul coming to christ one soul coming into the kingdom it's worth more than ten thousand words but yet he meant god wants to use us but we don't wanna we're too busy we're selfish it's not god will be done is yo what i want and what i want to do where i want to go what i want in life it's not we care a little about what god planned for your life what god purposed for you we don't even consult him we just feel like god if you bless me with this gift for this i'll just you know just use it like i want it's not for you when god gives you a gift it's not for you freely you have received freely give god bless you with talents and gifts it's for to be a blessing for the kingdom of god the first thing you look at is the kingdom of god how can i be a blessing to the kingdom god you gave it to me i want to give it back to you a lot of times we care less about whether or not we want to be famous and glorified by the world see let him first what oh i got this degree i got this i've achieved this and that what does that mean in the sight of god nothing all your achievements all that your goals and all your aspirations all that you want to be and all that you want to do it don't mean nothing if god is not in it if god is not in control and god is not first it means nothing and it's not playing around like you amen know what god will and purpose for you because this is what god has blessed me with so i can do this and i want to do that it's all about i want to i tell you 70 make you think about a lot of things god i've been here a long time but a long time it's a very short time but let me get more serious about what's left you could come at any time but what's left what more can i do and don't let me do a whole lot that don't mean nothing that is of less value i'm doing because i i just doing tr you know it's like the prophet said trying to do god's service without it being his will is that the will of god is that something you want to do is that what god wants to do so i said god you know i've done a lot of things and i worked hard but was it god will right now i've got to be more tuned in and got to be more lord i'm more conscious lord i don't want to just move because you know i just don't want to do what i want god you you know give me that macedonia call give me that thing that you you that cry that somebody needs god and i want to use you to minister to them somebody's crying out and i want you to be a vessel that's willing to go and willing to do what i want done i said god that's what i want i don't want to move just because i can somebody says well brother simmons i want you to come over here and preaching over there i don't want to be you know some minutes they just go anywhere and they're doing it i mean god ain't talking you know i know that see sometimes we can worry about a social status of popularity and who's gonna we can worry about a lot of things but what good is that gonna do at the end of the road when god and him it's what's going to be of importance to god whether it's the will of god whether god had a plan a purpose if god's going to use you to his glory you can see somebody come to conviction somebody come to christ somebody give their heart to the lord somebody filled with the spirit somebody healed somebody delivered once you seeing those type of things happening say thank you jesus thank you jesus for putting me in the way thank you jesus for using that because we were obedient to his him god was we were able to be a blessing to others because we were obedient to him sometimes i believe that sometimes it's all about us being a blessing to ourselves what's going to make benefit me it's all about me it's not about god at all it's about me what i want what i think a lot of times we evaluate situations and we evaluate and we put people on different levels and in our minds and we have evaluated but we have not looked at ourselves why am i doing that is it that pleasing me what am i looking for what am i searching for something to please me or is that a hunger and thirst to be closer to god and god i want your will to be done my desires to be fulfilled or am i crying out to god oh god i want your desires what you desire lord what you wanting god why how you want to use so he says if any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross now sometimes we want to follow him without the cross are you with me we want to follow jesus and we haven't done the first two principles we haven't denied ourselves and we want to follow him without a cross anytime a cross is in it any time we have to carry a cross something wrong something wrong in the church something wrong in the house something wrong in the marriage something wrong oh there's got to be something wrong with when a cross is involved amen we we think something is wrong there's a problem i got to get rid of this marriage i got to get rid of this uh these are where did your children come from they come from you i don't want to deal with them they're they bad they they're this in that way y'all get that from you got it from your daddy no the daddy said you got it from your mama there's always an excuse but when it comes down to amen being parents and and looking to god that this is the cross that we have to carry we're going to have some problems the children going to go through certain things the family going to go through the marriages don't go through certain things we're going to have to have a cross well where there is no cross there's no crown well there's no suffering there's no reigning are you with me so don't look at the cross as being something terrible look at the cross that oh lord what he says in second timothy 3 you don't have to turn in 12. he said yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer what persecution and all that will live godly if you live in a god of life you're going to suffer persecution but that part that part we don't as christians we don't want that part of it but that is the christian's life that is what makes a christian a christian they gotta suffer because there's a cross there's a denied one self we don't want amen oh god to come from among the world in the things of the world we want to hold on to the world and the friendship of the world and the people of the world associates amen the the the schoolmates and the amen people on the job and friends sometimes we got to walk away from it all our friends have not seen can two walk together except to be in agreement can light and darkness dwell in the same place the bible said if we walk in the light it sees in the light amen then we have fellowship one with another amen see i i i i i i i we want fellowship with the with the world and sometimes we think that we're isolated we want to be isolated and insulated we don't want i you know we don't want the world in and we isolate ourselves and insulate ourselves and make sure that we are so safe come on we want to vindicate ourselves and make ourselves so that our light is shining so bright that we have to do something to to separate ourselves your life that you live will cause separation you don't have to say well i i i don't want nothing to do with you they don't want nothing to do with you light and darkness don't mix together now if they if you got to say i don't want nothing to do with you something wrong because which one is stronger the darkness of the light so if you light you don't have to worry about the darkness because the darkness don't want the light the bible says the light shining in the darkness and the darkness is comprehended and not are you with me sometimes we're so afraid of the sinner and so afraid of them that we want to cause ourselves i want nothing to do with don't come by my house no no no no no no no it's your opportunity to tell them about jesus and if they don't want to hear about jesus they ain't coming by to see you not that you want to be uh all in and all but i'm saying your life itself is it lifts up a standard against them your life that you live lift up or standing they feel condemned even in your house and in your presence on the job in the school they already feel condemned because they know something about you that's different from them and those demons that they gotta hold to it's different it caused them to tremble the bible said the devil's the devil bleed but he trembles you believe that there's one god but he trembles are you with me can i go a little further now the last stage spirit in second timothy here second timothy three you wonder what you're about and what you're fighting if your greatest enemy is yourself then you're fighting the last day in this time you're fighting amen against your greatest enemy and you got to realize that if you don't battle and you don't fight that's why one writer said i died daily it's a it's a daily dying out to self it's always something that i got to crucify amen i'm crucified into the world and and i got to continually recruit live a crucified life it's always something i gotta you know die too it's always when i think i'm fully dead then there's something else to rise up and god reveals something else that i have to amen die to something else that i've said something else that i've done something that i've thought i gotta die i gotta continually die daily i gotta continue to battle with situations and things that i'm confronted with i gotta die many men come after me you know i thought about it why should i for what purpose or what value why should i deny myself isn't it all about trying to please ourselves and be happy well why should i for what purpose should i do that why should i carry a cross why do i want to carry one what's so glorious in that what makes it across amen being persecuted and being talked about and being buked and scone and looking at pointing why why should i have to be a victim of that why should i want to be who want to be picked up who want to be ridicuted who want to be persecuted who want to be look that is an oddball who want to be that who want to look like a nut oh why should i want to be like that i know the young people are confronted why can't i be cool what can i be or why can't i can be with the in crowd why can't i be amen praise god what can i wear amen um nike or lebron no oh why can't i you know come with the best of the best what can i be impressive why can't i be one that's admired why why can't i be impressive why can't i go to the same excessive writing as others for what purpose why you want me to carry across why you want me to walk live like that why you want me to doctor myself i don't see the fight in it there's got to be some type of purpose in me carrying this cross i don't and the value of it oh why why why you want me to do that mama why you want me to live like that daddy why why a preacher what you why you want me to do you don't know what i go through daily you don't know what i suffer young ladies wearing dresses all the time and people don't look at me strange and amen i don't want to do this y'all making me do this and i go through and i'm victimized i'm going through pain i i feel odd i feel different i don't want to do it there's something in me why should i want it everybody else got a girlfriend a boyfriend everybody else is smoking dope and you know getting a drink and they're doing all kind of stuff and and i can't do it why can't i i i want to do what they're doing i want to be like everybody else why should i be different what should i do differently why don't you put all this pressure on me why am i going through all this pressure thing why why i have to go to a church like this why can't i go to a church when i'm free why can't i go somewhere where i can do what i want to do and be like i want to be because that's not what i want let me get away from all this you know this stuff don't make no sense this cross that y'all talking about is it i i'm not i'm i'm not down with that i i don't believe that i have to go through this hurting hurtness pain and this difficulty of times why should i be a victim the last day spirit what we're battling see because we don't have the answers sometimes as long as you're in my house as long as you're in this house [Music] see sometimes we feel threatened we feel like we're under the law that we're going to get stoned if we don't do right we feel a victim and don't know that i'm dealing with my pain i'm dealing with my hurt i'm dealing with uh battles that i want to do this and i want to do that but somebody's keeping me from it i don't know how to deal with what i'm going through because i feel in me that i want to do this and i want to do that what are the benefits mama unhappy daddy unhappy people in the church ain't happy if it's something about if it's gonna make you happy why aren't they happy why aren't people dancing and shouting the world is dancing their part and they're getting hot they enjoying it why people enjoying jesus if he's supposed to make you have happy he's gonna make you dance amen he's gonna make you shout amen he's something that you wake up good morning jesus i love you amen praise god brother and sister sometimes our examples has been presented and we wonder how jesus is looking at us when do we understand our plight or the journey that we're on do you really recognize and understand it do you understand the purpose of the cross it's not for jesus he's already carried his the things that he's actually you don't endure and the things that he's asking you to stand for and stand with him because it's not for his good it's for your good are you with me he's looking out for you even though you don't realize you he's looking out for you the things that he asks you to do is not going to make him anymore god he's already god praise god it's not going to elevate him it's not said we have fathers in the flesh that corrects us for their own pleasure but god is for ours are you a man ii timothy three this is what you're battling brother and sister this is what you're facing but you don't see you got to come face to face that god is looking out for you you may not understand the good that's in this now amen but we understand it better bye bye when the morning come things that god is oh lord for this no just know also that in the last days do we believe we're there the dangerous perilous times shall we come and one of the first things that he had to deal with that men shall be what jesus the first thing he said if any man if you come after him me let him what so paul picks it up and and he says then i'm going to tell you what's going to happen in the last days there's going to be some dangerous troubled times and in these troubled times i want to tell you the attitude of the world he's speaking to the church and telling the church what they're going to face in the future and he's trying to warn you of these spirits and tell you amen i want you to identify amen what's happening with you what's going on in your life and what you're facing i want you to see your battle i want you to see what you got to deal with what you got to fight are you with me so he says knowing this amen troubled times dangerous time for men should be lovers of their own self so your greatest enemy is yourself and you got to deal with yourself and you got to deny yourself now the vindication of the evidence that you've denied yourself is that you've taken up your cross are you with me but if you said you denied yourself and there's no cross that you're carrying then i doubt seriously that you denied yourself because the next step in the one self is taking up the cross so you don't complain about your journey about your flight about the things that you go do because you know that all things work together for what so you know that you're suffering of this present time and not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in you are you with me so the things that you go through thinking not strange concerning the amen fiery trials which are going to try you oh you look man but counted all joy when you fall into the diver's temptation are you with me when you go through different temptatious kind of joy and say lord thank you lord i'm happy because you are in control god thank you lord god you are my deliverer you're my healer sickness may come death may come problems may come situations may come but lord thank you hallelujah hey god bless jesus about to cross alone in all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me are you with me so if i gotta find a way that i'm gonna praise the lord regardless of my circumstances regardless of my condition i'm gonna find a way amen if i don't have but one little hand let me raise that hand and say thank you amen if i don't have but one leg let me give that praise god sister robinson didn't have no legs but she was kicking the nerves she was lifting up the nubs in the wheelchair and she was praising the lord like she had when she had to let you she was praising the lord when she didn't have no leg she was still praising the law oh god hallelujah praise god that reminds me gene the son-in-law going to preach for us friday night brother gene whatever but see i i'm going to tell you something we got enough weight to hold us down won't even let us lift our hands we'll let us stand on our feet i'm gonna tell you something you read the book a song you're gonna read the book a song he's gonna tell you to come in the house let us stand let us worship let us praise the lord amen either we believe that or or it's for somebody else is it for us we're going to praise the lord or we're going to sit there and look god didn't tell you to come in the house and be a spectator and just be looking he told you to come and praise the lord are you what man and if we can't praise the lord we're in the wrong place because amen the folks don't go to the club they meant looking to hear a sermon are you a man they when you come to church david said i was happy if i can't be glad something wrong not with the church something wrong with me because i was glad i'm obeying god it's for god to take care of all the situations and problems that ain't my problem i'm gonna do what god said forget about what everybody else they ask for me in my house i'm going to serve the lord it's all about amen i'm obeying god i'm doing what he said for me to do if you don't do it that's up to you praise god i ain't gonna let no rock amen i'ma praise god while i got a chance praise god sometimes the devil coming all kinds of little things happen to us but are we are we doing what we're supposed to do with what we got the the one talent that we got the one little gift we got are we using that the little strength that we got are we raising these hands are we saying lord i thank you but he says we battle with dying to ourselves denying ourselves we battle with that because we didn't if we hadn't denied ourselves we're always going to have inward battles we don't we want it to be somebody else we want to be something or somebody said to us somebody did to us we want to have a reason for not serving the lord not worshiping the lord amen and then sometimes our sin wears down our sin on wales to keep us from praising the lord our our mindset how we think or keep us and usually that's because is our sins we don't feel worthy to pray to the lord we don't feel like we're in the right condition to praise him so if that's not our problem then we have no problem no reason because a senator don't want to praise god because they're worshiping the devil are you with me but if we worship the law we want to praise him well i don't have to prove to nobody nothing you're proving nobody anything one way they'll you're just proving that to the devil that he got you bound up if he got you bound up why am i bound oh somebody did this somebody said that uh no no no no no no no no no the joy that i have what and what you got to give it up if you don't have your praise you don't have your testimonies you can't worship you gave the devil that place because his shoulder can't come behind you fortified behind the word the devil can't come and he can't cross the bloodline you got to go out to him he ain't he can't come in here and take your praise from you you ain't gonna take my praise from me but what happened is you have no praise then you have no victory that the prophet said dancing is a is a sign that you have victory amen and you ain't got no victory you ain't got no dance so when they cross the uh red sea they start dancing because they had what victory praise god when you don't have no victory well i don't have no dancing i never did have a dance just lift your hand and jump praise god people go to those ball games and they win and they're jumping when they losing what come on somebody when you losing you what look at somebody say you losing or you're winning if you lose and you know you know what when they look at you what you do look the other way because you don't want to say you know you know sorry ain't dealing with that who are you mad at wha what what right do you have to be mad for what i ain't got to participate i don't want to participate come on what's going on with people today what makes them soul lord have mercy but i'm saying it's time now to get rid of all that stuff that would but no excuse don't come say brother senator you know my problem in this distance i'm probably get rid of that i don't want to hear it not now we're too far up the road for people to say well my excuse no no no that's not your excuse your excuse that you're dealing with a devil that's inside you that's binding you up they're keeping you from praising the lord because nobody outside can take your joy away from you the only way you lose your joy is because you just allowed the devil to come in your life okay no well brother simmer you say it now ah no no don't put that devil on me i put it on you god showing let you put the devil on me claim that i oh brother song song said song song the sister song song did something and they took your job away well don't sing that song when they sing that song the joy that i have the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away are you with me when they saying that don't sing again because somebody can take your joy from you he said no man take your joy are you with me the peace that god gives you no man gave it to you and no man can take it from you are you what man if god gave it to you amen praise god hallelujah what god opened no man can shut and what god shut no man can open when god bless you amen oh the devil can't curse you amen i don't care what it says he can't curse you praise god because you oh hallelujah god thank you the devil can't curse you no matter how hard he tried praise god if you're going through a testament while i'm going through the test amen the dough is slaying there yet i'm gonna trust him amen i learned in all things i'm gonna praise the lord praise god when the sun is shining i'm praising him amen when it's cloudy and raining i'm gonna praise you god at all times i'm gonna praise you hallelujah i'm gonna thank god in the midst of it all you see as i was just praying and meditating on the lord he said the purpose of the cross that you're caring it's because you understand how much jesus loves you when you understand the love of god and you appreciate the love of god that the gift of god is eternal life that he gives you eternal life it means more than my life it means more than everything the coming experience the love of christ it means everything to me and that's what i'm saying brothers and sisters the lord says and i believe it's god maybe y'all might say well brother sam why you said the lord say it's not you saying it no that's why i said i believe if it's the lord it spoke to my heart god's love got to be revealed to you paul said when he pleased god which called me by his grace to reveal his son in me in other words i had to come in contact with the one that gave himself for me i had to understand how much he cared about me and that god really loved me he loved me so dearly and so much that he gave his life for me i'm not living this life and i'm not wearing dresses because i have to i'm not amen i'm not partying and going to the excessive riding because i have to you're not in this marriage because amen of the law you're not loving your husband because some law making you forcing you somebody making you you ought to be in the marriage because you love one another if you're in christ and you don't love him then i see that it makes it difficult it's a difficult marriage and it's difficult amen to treat one another right if you don't love him if you don't if you're not concerned about their their pain and their hurt and the things that they go through hij well did you have a good day you love your children how i had school today well uh what what you go through today how's your job today what you're going through amen because you love them you're concerned about them they know that you care but you don't never ask how you doing what happened today what did you go through what was new then they sat down and they talked about that and shared and you said some things you have to let's pray about that let's let's go in prayer with that amen there's no communication you know no communication no consideration but i understood that i try to raise your children to fall in love with jesus and the the reason why you don't do certain things is because you love him and that's the same way you approach a marriage you are it ought to be based off of the love it ought to not be based off of i like the way she looked oh he's a nice hamster young man it ought to be character based in order you ought to be seeing character and what we saw in jesus was character and we fell in love with his character and not only with his characters what he's done for me what nobody else could do for me amen he done something for me brother sister i was wretched and undone without god or his son but when he reached down his hand for me amen i'm so glad he reached down his hand for me praise god it's not what i've done but what he done for me it made me want to amen because one day i didn't know what he'd done for me i heard about it but i didn't really know it i went to church and they talked to me about it my mama told me about it my sisters told me about different ones told me but i didn't know for myself but one day he came to me amen and i saw how much he cared about me i was able to turn around and say lord i love you too lord i thank you too i i appreciate it didn't know it all the time i heard about it but i didn't have an experience but when i experienced it amen praise god i was willing to do anything i was willing to go i wanted to live right why because i fell in love with about what my soul needed what i was longing for didn't know it there was a deep calling to the deed and it deep responded there was something that i needed but i didn't know what i needed something that oh god but when he came then came jesus hallelujah brother when you're in that valley of decision and you don't know which way to go then came jesus when you're in a crossroad and not know what to do with your life then came jesus amen he came right down when i was they man all turned and twisted and don't know what i'm gonna do in my life thank god i was a young man and didn't know what i was gonna do what i was gonna do i was gonna hang on what's next but jesus came at my crossroads he came to see about me put a desire in my heart to serve him praise god because i didn't have that desire i didn't have him in the picture too young too much that i wanted to experience but i'm so glad that he came to see about me are you with me maybe i'll i won't get into the last day spirit but i'm going to tell you something romans tells us that see something about connecting with him roman said what shall separate me he said who should separate me from the love of christ see that's what i'm saying you when you become one with that love the holy ghost the shed of the broad the love of god shed it brought in your heart by the holy ghost and he said who don't let nobody who didn't say what he said who who should separate us from the love of christ he said shall tribulation that's 8 and 35 tribulation romans 8 35 uh distress or what persecution of famine a necklace of pearls or swole are you with me he said as it is written for god's sake we are what killed we are killed all the day long we are counted as what it's kind of the sheep for the slaughter name and all these things will what hallelujah think about it when that love become real to you when the love of god becomes so real to you when you know that he loves you when you know that you love him it becomes so real it's it magnifies itself above all that the devil has offered praise god it's not compared the world give me this whole world it's not no comparison to my soul because hallelujah what prophet a man to gain the whole world lose his soul but god saved my soul amen he saved my soul from a burning hell he saved my soul from a lot of the stuff that's going on in the streets today praise god just look where would i be if jesus didn't care why would i be if he didn't lay down his life for me thank you jesus amen it's nay and all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us but i am persuaded neither death not what life know what not what no principalities know what powers now what not things present you know what when next time you come to the house of the lord realizing you coming to worship him praise god you know i don't want to say it but if there's something wrong in here then there's something wrong in the word that would keep you from praising god and i know ain't nothing wrong with the word our problem our greatest enemy is what and you got to come face to face with that that i'm gonna let nobody take my worship away take me from praising the lord i don't care what you say what you think who told what said what it ain't got nothing to do with my praise praise god maybe you know the prophet said amen that was a name before the foundation the word do you you know what he said about you about your that was a name for the foundation world i ain't going to worry about that he just push it off that don't bother me that was the name for the foundation the word detroit me test me see your response see how you were going hey amen how about the prophet preaching somebody doing something filthy on the front room angel said what what you say just what you say what you gonna do about it whatever you say to happen you want them paralyzed you want them to fall dead right there on the front row whatever you say to happen he said i forgive you the angel said you said the right thing he was a test and he said the right thing are you with me see we got to we got to get in the right frame of mind where we can say the right thing i forgive you no matter what the situation how bad it look i'll forgive you huh are you with me whatever hurt whatever pain i forgive you whatever you've been through the disappointed or whatever it's called you know i forgive you are you with me and what happens that was to try him testing you may be on the test on a trial somewhere in your life somewhere with your christian wall and god is just testing you like you test abraham just to see what was in abraham god tested us don't you ever don't you ever think god eyes is closing and god don't understand and god don't see god knows everything if he allowed it then you got to realize hey this god's business praise god if you do the right thing god will take care of you god bless you let us stand i had some things paul he said in acts that they came to a place and it said they wanted to confirm the souls of the disciples exalting them that to continue in the faith acts 14 20 2 continue in the faith that we must through much tribulation to continue in the faith that we must do much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god are you with me y'all understand much tribulation i'm gonna tell you something god ain't gonna let nothing happen to you you're gonna let no nothing happen to you amen if it ain't for your good job are you with me if you're in his will and walking in his word then ain't nothing gonna happen to you and when you get out the wheel god corrects us chastises us to get back in his will to get back in his grace and it's oh god listen are you with me so don't despise the chasing of the lord when god correct you just get in line say lord i love you let us just smile father we thank you again for lord you said if any man come after me let him first deny himself father i've not conducted my life at all times that i've denied myself and lord i want to come to that place lord come back to the first love come back to realize that if if i'm gonna fault anybody i'm not gonna fault you i'm not gonna fight anybody i'm not gonna fall my brothers my sisters i'm not gonna fault the church lord i'm gonna bring because lord i thank you for opening my eyes sometimes i fall to lord sometimes i get a little twisted up and a little turn but lord i want to come to this place this morning but i want to lay my gifts on the altar then i want to say lord i come to this place where i say lot not my
