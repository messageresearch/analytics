pressing the battle 11 o'clock tomorrow and come and do what you can do sisters brothers and those who want to stay around and help clean the church tonight you're welcome to do so praise god we thank god for you joshua 1 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speaking to joshua the son of nun moses minister said moses my servant is dead now therefore rise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall threat upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and from this leviton even even until the great evening to this to leavening the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your cause there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee and i will not fail thee not forsake thee and god bless you read this word you may be seated he said i will not fail you and i will not forsake you we thank god that god would do what exactly what he's saying we want to say tonight probably god spoke a message on leadership but we want to talk about follow the leader follow the leader [Music] you know that's a difficult time in this hour that we're living in where leaders of every angle of being persecuted in the natural world in the political world and and um just all around leaders the teachers in school they don't get any respect parents don't get any respect leaders are being persecuted this is the age that is a rebellious age it's a age that does not respect headship or leadership so we want to say follow the leader and there are very few followers but we should say follow the leader now joshua is the end time leader and so by the grace of god and joshua is a type of the holy ghost and those that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so by the grace of god we want to just share with you that joshua was to carry the children over into the promised land and and they were to be unstoppable and undefeated only if they would hearing says in the sixth verse it says be strong and of good courage fall unto this people shall thou divide an inheritance of the land which i swear until their fathers to give them it says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou may observe to do according to what all the what see that's a problem that is the problem he said all according to the law see when we joshua had a commandment of the lord and god said as i was with moses i'll be with you but i want you to be a strong and courageous i want you to have all those attributes before joshua could be commissioned to be the successor of moses he had to what follow the word are y'all with me i i i don't mean to preach tonight i just mean to kind of teach and talk to you tonight but joshua had to be a good what a good follower and before god can really you know bring the church into adoption state then they have to be under tutor are you with me and before god can trust you with the true riches with the things that the bride is to do in the end time amen she's to be an invincible army but in order to be an invisible army first of all we got to learn how to be good what good soldiers are you with me see i'm a soldier in the what soldiers are to follow follow the leader follow directions if we cannot follow directions then we're not an invincible army so the devil tactic is to uh cause division take the people have the people disrespect the prophet talked about the message respect disrespect leadership or headship when there's this so on to disregard what the leader has said when they begin to dis regard or not follow direction from the leader things happen things happen to a church things happened to the church when the church did not follow the what leader when the church failed to follow the leader things happened now there was they were successful amen joshua told them in the first battle jericho and all and uh they were just to march around in the city and the walls and they marched around and they kept marching and and y'all know the story how the walls of jericho fell that was a great victory but it came up against another battle later on in the seventh chapter and so forth we talk about the battle of a ai so he sent spies to spy ai and and hey y'all can read it later i i thought i would read it but that's a whole lot of reading and ai was a it was just a few people just a small uh group of people there in ai and um the people had done a successful campaign against jericho and it was marching on but what happened at ai they said when they came back to joshua they told joshua the story of after they've uh looked and spotted out and searched it and um they said in seven and two and joshua sent uh from jericho to ai which is beside beth haven on the east side of bethel and speak unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ai and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or what three thousand now what happened the man went up now joshua was the end time leader you know he was the one that god had commissioned to lead the people right they come back and they tell him what they're telling joshua what they were doesn't that seem like this age they're going to tell joshua what to do are you with me can't you see the children trying to tell their parents what to do you know what i'm saying they don't mean no harm but they they're trying to uh lead the parents are you with me and sometimes we can get out of position on the job and lose our job because why we begin to tell the boss how to be the boss or the one that's in charge the supervisor we try to tell them how to be the supervisor and see a lot of times when we do that it's trouble on the job and then you have those that uh been around for a little while that they go around and they take this supervisor place you know they they're on the side telling people how to run the job because we've been here a long time we know what we're talking about you see what i'm saying so they tell the super tell the people as donated supervisor supervisor come and say what's going on over here brother frank and i was you know he was telling you know we were having a good you know good conversation and he was telling the uh uh brother simon you know you ought to try this i said yeah brother frank i tried that he said he didn't mean no he said brother seven you ought to try i said you had brother frank i tried that too you something but see a lot of times um when you do all you can do to try to get the church in where it can go forward and go higher in the lord and be successful in in in god sometimes it looks you you might look like a fail amen but one thing about it you got to stay with god's word no matter how bad it may make you look are you with me so it doesn't matter how many assistant pastors you have no matter how long their dress is and how much prophetess they are joshua was commissioned and he's the end time leader are you with me uh the prophet you know you had those those those prophets that was trying to instruct moses how to do his job are you with me it's always that paul had those demons and so forth and he had those people that was trying to you know do a better job than him that's why he said demons has forsaken me and in the end time you know the prophet god had demons okay so we want to go on and um this this seventh chapter of joshua and i'm gonna tell you something the devil don't want you to be on one or what he don't want you to want to call it so we we we're talking about follow the leader the devil will do everything he can do to keep you from being on one accord now you know they were successful at jericho because they were what they won't want a car and they followed the what yeah when joshua said march around they marched around but here they come back to telling joshua how to do it you know and and here's what one writer says the people began to think that it was them doing the job that's why they said we don't we don't need but a few see what i'm saying because they they looked at uh it it's not we don't need all these people to go up against ai just just let us go up you know and that's what happens people think that oh we we we've captured of uh the mighty walls of jericho and fall and we've beat you know we take we've taken over jericho look at this this ain't nothing you know how it is this ain't nothing and it sounds sensible right because they they forgot who gave them the victory we don't need to pray about this have you ever been talking about oh let's do this and never prayed about it never ask god is it all right you just see an opportunity to do it let's do it everybody oh yeah yeah it sounds good to me did no prayer no consulting god and here they are they come back and they see these little bit of people yo oh boy you've had a such a a successful campaign and jericho to amen we don't need all okay so just telling joshua how to do it right and they returned and they said let the third verse let's not all the people go up but let about what two or three thousand you know that's all we need man go up and smite ai and make not all the people do label theater for they are but a few so they went up to the of the people about 3 000 men and they what they got what are y'all with me they really got whip cause 30 some odd men to die all your whooping because there was somebody when they got through searching they found a achin into what cam aiken was there in the camp and aiken had taken a babylonian garment you know somebody can take a mystery babylon garment are you of me they can take that spirit of babylon are you with me and they can get off in the spirit and cause a lot of damage because of lack of respect and that god did not put them in charge he put joshua in charge are you with me so they got they two cent they're gonna put in it instead of being humble and obedient they want to put their two cents on it and do their own thing their own way are you with me but i said joshua is the end time leader the bible said they that are led by what how do you know when you're led by the spirit of god and that's the trouble the the trouble is it's so many that can say well i'm led by the spirit to do this and i'm led by the spirit to do that what spirit what spirit is it see we got to know what spirit we're talking about because god is not the author of what if confusion isn't that right and god will not lead you against his what words if god lead if i tell you something that's different from what the words say and we got amen we got a dust said the lord and god has sent money god for in this hour are you with me and we cannot respect what he's saying i don't think people respect what i say if they don't respect what he said with all the vindication are you with me so by the grace of god i i i i don't know i was praying because i i really didn't know i think it was brother ernie's turn tonight but i said lord let me be ready you know because i i don't think brother ernie's going to be this is anniversary time i don't think he's going to be here tonight so let me go ahead on be ready okay so i just prayed god give me something i'll tell you what i wanted to talk on i wanted to talk on the love of god and i i just saw the you know just just you know how much he loved us and you know i i've been talking about that a lot and um what would you give up for god what would you what would you really give up for for god seeing that he gave everything he had up for you do you love him enough to give up everything you got for him he he left everything he had heaven and angels and worshipping i mean he came down in the likeness of sin for flesh gave up everything i know moses gave up a lot right but christ gave up a lot for you are you worth it is your life worthy of the gospel do you think you've given up enough for christ's sake are you with me see because sometimes we think whatever we've done we did it for the church we did it for the pastor we did it for one another we have no idea that you haven't done nothing yet when it compares to christ and what he gave up for you and you can never replace the love of god amen if you understand if you understood or understand how much he loves you and what he gave up for you for you to be a son or daughter of god then you would give him the uttermost respect okay i talked about soldiers falling direction i talked about sheep needing a shepherd i was teaching a group of people and they were people that were more outstanding and more intelligent and they were different races and different backgrounds and i was in this huge church in the big corner in charlotte north carolina and this humongous church and my nephew calvin got me opportunities to go there and teach this group of people and the name of the group was called the body the body and in the body that's a whole it's all over the nation and all over the world probably the body and this is what they believe that the church let's go to colossians i'm skipping over a lot of stuff because i'm trying to get to the point i'm trying to close i'm trying to close okay colossians 1. there's so much i could go through but a a a good leader has to be a good follower first jesus had them he said come and follow me what if they didn't follow jesus they just stayed away the world and what what if they followed him but so far you know because 70 of them turn around when he said except you eat my flesh and drank my blood now they weren't good followers and there was only 12 left and one of them was a devil he got to a point that he was going to sell jesus out didn't that write his brother dwayne was talking about selling out jesus he sold jesus out isn't that right so he said i'm not showing you 12 and you know one of y'all ain't with me you know what i'm saying you know i i know in shepherding and pastoring you wouldn't want everybody to be with you but you know only those that love you will be with you amen if they love you they'll they'll be with you in thick and insane amen they'll show their love and their action and uh and they'll do anything they can do for you i know i had pastors and time passed and you know i used to think you know i appreciate the pastor so much because you know he preached the gospel to me and i thought that my life was totally changed i was getting my pink cadillac and i was gonna be like charleston blue oh boy i was got my pink out of rod i got my money i'm ready to go and i got saved and when i got saved i would do anything you know the pastor asked me to do i was willing because i was just so appreciative i'm saved now look where i was going down that dark road didn't even know i was going down there just 18 19 years old you know all set up look went to the movie one time and i saw charleston blue and i'm gonna get me a paint cadillac el dorado you see what i'm saying so by the grace of god god can change everything you know i used to think you know i had so much i love my pastor so much he said he said i need to come i said you need a car i had my paint cadillac money i said go buy you one he would have bought him a brand new one you know i gave him what i was gonna get because i wanted him to have and when he said y'all understand because when you love somebody you give it it doesn't matter you and then i was thinking sometimes if somebody came in and they want to do something to my pastor i jump in the front i'd rather die first you know what i'm saying you know when you really care about somebody you you give your life it doesn't matter you know that's the way i said god when i stop feeling that way about the people if somebody come in here to try to harm y'all i want to be the first one to get in the front and get my life first see what i'm saying but when i lose that when i don't no longer want to do that then i don't need to be a pastor anymore are you with me i'm talking about for the least one i'm not talking about the one that you know that you know would give me the last time i'm talking about the one that wouldn't give me a penny you see what i'm saying but i got to be if i don't have that in me if i'm just going to love those that you know love me then what reward have we you got to love everybody regardless of what they'd say or do jesus gave his life while we were yet sinners for the ungodly he gave himself for us are you so it is not about the you know it is it's about understanding and and knowing what he did for you and if you're not willing to lay down your life for one another are you with me you got to be willing to lay down your life for one another brother go back to the body yo i got to close but the body colossians 1 and 14. it's it's good to be in the house of the lord and because uh i tell you where would i be in some i'd probably be dead in some night club oh i know i didn't like those but you know that's what the devil would have ultimately done you had no place to go but in the the devil's church the nightclub and stuff like that and you know you could have been a drug on drugs and doing all kind of stuff but god mercy savior when you young boy with a foolish mind and a foolish heart but god come by and save you come by have mercy on your soul you save you from a lot of headaches and trouble mess another folk life up messing your own life up with god's savior and you know when god saved you like that and you know where you was headed you do everything you can do that's what i understand about folk they don't do everything they can do to try to keep somebody from going the way you were going if you recognize the road you was going down then you he said after the holy ghost come upon you you should have power and you should be witnesses to me you'll tell somebody about the love that they can experience this love and how this love affected your whole life how it changed you made you a new creature made you not want to do those things you don't want you don't want to do that you don't want to be a fornicator adultery you don't want to be i mean you don't want oh lord you want to be a child of god you love him because you appreciate what he's done for you oh god i was blind but nah i see now colossians 1 and 14 it says in whom we have redemption to his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and in visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominion or principalities or powers all things were created by him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the what you know the little group of people they were called the body they were i think they were very intelligent people the body and um i thank god that they gave me somebody simple like me they gave me respect and they let me come in and teach them and witness to them and and i appreciate the humility they even came down to the tent revival and with us and so forth and but i i appreciate that but one i i i felt like it was time for me to zero in i've been your friend a little while and i was touching here and now but now it's time to zero in on the body see one thing about it they were so interested in the body and in the body they just let the supposed to let the spirit be led and we all sat around and whoever want to say something uh you know can take the flow and say what they got to say you know the body so i got my opportunity i didn't sit around here long enough and i was y'all listening to me pretty good and receiving pretty good but i said today is the day i said the body got to have a head and i thought then if you were sheep then where is the shepherd it's because they didn't believe in no pastors they just believe in being layered by the word everybody's spirit you know and so nobody no pastors nowhere you go it's just the body but he said here it says and he is the head of the body so they say he's the head god is the head of the body and said the church who is the beginning and the firstborn from the dead that he might have the preeminence so they said it's just the holy ghost don't need no head don't need those i says i thought she needed the shepherd they said and one of the sisters ella and his sister she looked at me and she said huh i never heard that before you know i said it's all right if you're not a sheep you don't need a shepherd but if you're a sheep i i believe you need a shepherd but if you're it's all right if you go you don't need no shepherd but a sheep needs a shepherd are you with me and the sheep don't lead themselves the shepherd leaves the sheep are you with me so when i said those things there was almost a yearning and a crime because i saw that it took over the little congregation but i had a few brothers on the side that's very intellectual oh no oh no i said give me bible what you gonna say now they didn't have no bible no bible nobody could dispute but they just had never heard nobody come in there and just directed them if you're gonna be sheep you need a shepherd and i said it's time now that you need a shepherd you need somebody he when he said he led captivity captain gave gibson to men he gave some apostles some prophet some pastors some teachers for the what work in the ministry for the edified in the body amen until we all come into the statute of what and see what i'm saying to disrespect the the bible let's go to ephesians 5 and i'm closing on this scripture ephesians 5 but to disrespect to be led by the spirit and disrespect the word i believe we're not led by god's spirit we're really laid by another spirit because we cannot disrespect the word it's just like the brother says you can't receive the holy ghost lessen you in you know the message or whatever and i said well you know are they distinguishing the message different from the bible i said what i'm getting is it's the message and the bible is over here somewhere and it's the message over here somewhere but if the bible is the one that said jesus gives the holy ghost then i can't see you separating the message from the bible and the bible said if a man repent and repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ he shall receive what am i right so what if a person did that is that the message it should be because what was the purpose of the message is to take us back to what the faith of the apostolic fathers is that one of the man that had the keys said this how you get it and this one the prophet said you said lord if you don't have the holy ghost he said you said lord you promised it am i right and if the holy ghost come amen because you hold god to his word and said god you promise it isn't that right and then what all of this talk about you know what i'm saying people make the bible of none of faith if you believe what god's servant bald you believe the bible amen this is this is original quote book this is what he used the bible brother sister is the bible amen come on let's get back to the bible amen because that's the quote original quote book line up with the word if you don't line up with the word what good is don't separate this amen it must all bleed together amen one law one faith one baptism amen one god father of allah above all through all in you all same god amen they're not having a god you know what if god allows somebody down the street amen the cast out devils and they're not with us he said what leave him alone am i right don't bother them you're going to do what you want to do ain't that right thank god for revealing this word to us for this hour amen i appreciate that i can't hold them responsible for what god gave me he gave me the revelation of the word for doubt but i can't hold them responsible if they don't see i can't pick at them and look down on them i feel sorry for them are you with me petty them are you with me but god is good to us because we don't understand what's going on amen it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom and god it's oh god the book is open to you amen this is an open book it's not seal anymore are you up there so brothers and sisters amen don't spend your time trying to condemn others just thank god that you you have it amen and if you've got it you'll show somebody the love of god amen with loving kindness will you draw are you with me you never want a man by condemning him you between a man by showing him love you show them how much god loved them and how much you love them if a man don't respect show if you don't show a person you care about them they don't want to hear nothing you say but when the person realizes you really are concerned and you care and then they're willing to listen to you well you ain't supposed to do this you're not it's not law it's love are you with me and if you do this you're going ah it's the love of god you know i don't try to convince my children they're going to hell if they don't live right i don't try to convince them of that i try to convince him if you love god you do the right thing if you love god you'll live right you'll do the right thing are you with me do they always do the right thing do i always do the right thing if we all make mistakes sometimes isn't that right but it's the grace of god that he always forgives us put us back on the right course and we thank god for his grace that helps us keep on running the race 5 and 23 it says for the husband is to what ephesians 5 23 for the husband is the one head of the wife even as christ is the world and he is the one savior of the body therefore let therefore as the church is what so let the wives be to their world own husband and what said husband love you wise even if christ also loved the church amen and gave himself for it are you with me is that a problem amen if you want the wife to be subject love her like christ loved the church isn't that right and if you're the body then christ is your head and he is the what the word are you with me he is the word not something mystified not something you know the prophet he's the word he's your word he is the word amen so don't make some mystery or something way out somewhere here is the word obey the word follow the what follow the leader follow you're right follow the word you're all right follow the word that's the leader amen he said don't let this law depart from you amen meditate on it day and night stay in the word brothers and sisters you know i go back on scriptures because when you get my age you got to keep on meditating on the scriptures to keep
