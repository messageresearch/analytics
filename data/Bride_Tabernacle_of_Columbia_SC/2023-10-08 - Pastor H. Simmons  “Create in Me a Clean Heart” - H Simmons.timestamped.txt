[48:06] 51 have mercy upon me oh God according

[48:13] multitude of thy tender
[48:15] Mercy blot out my transgressions
[48:24] too find knowledge my transgressions and
[48:28] my sins is able before thee
[48:41] for behold I was shapen in iniquity and
[48:45] in sin that my mother concede me
[48:54] six
[48:57] together Purge me with hisp that I shall
[49:00] be clean wash me that I may be right as
[49:04] snow God bless you to read word you may
[49:06] be seated as I continue to
[49:09] read okay we're going to continue to
[49:12] read the eth verse it says make me to
[49:15] hear joy and
[49:19] gladness that the bones which thou H has
[49:22] broken May
[49:24] Rejoice how
[49:27] thy face for my sins and blot out all of
[49:32] my
[49:33] iniquities create in me a clean heart
[49:37] let us say that
[49:38] together in me a clean
[49:42] heart a right
[49:44] spirit
[49:46] amen my topic this morning created me a
[49:49] clean
[49:52] heart then he says after that is done he
[49:56] said cast me not away from thy
[49:59] presence and take not that Holy Spirit
[50:02] from
[50:03] me then he says restore unto me the joy
[50:07] of thy
[50:09] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[50:15] spirit and then will I teach
[50:18] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[50:22] be converted unto
[50:24] thee so this morning the 10th verse says
[50:29] create in me a clean
[50:33] heart
[50:35] now I was just praying I was going a
[50:38] different route and just praying this
[50:39] morning God what would you have me to
[50:42] say and just came so vividly in my
[50:47] spirit created
[50:49] me a clean
[50:53] heart I see what she
[50:56] the last time Rachel put up a little
[50:58] thing I didn't see it this time I see
[51:02] it created me a clean
[51:05] heart
[51:07] amen I I trust that each and every one
[51:11] of us still
[51:12] need to have a clean
[51:16] heart it's it is told that
[51:19] David had sinned
[51:22] and he had took another man's wife and
[51:26] lied with her and and
[51:29] sent the man out to battle and had him
[51:35] killed and so
[51:38] forth and then the prophet Nathan came
[51:42] to
[51:44] David and told him about a man had
[51:47] plenty of lambs and so forth and one man
[51:50] just had one shoe
[51:52] L
[51:54] and he took the man
[51:58] one and then it was told that David says
[52:03] somebody to do something like that that
[52:05] man ought to
[52:08] die and Nathan took and says David
[52:12] you're the
[52:15] man so in this song it
[52:18] typifies the condition David saw himself
[52:23] in and I said as a sinner we all have
[52:27] seen ourselves in that kind of condition
[52:30] amen
[52:32] yes and sometimes even as we walk this
[52:36] Christian walk we find ourselves
[52:38] sometimes Amen in in in a place where we
[52:42] need
[52:47] repentance so I want to try to work with
[52:52] parts of this song for a little bit and
[52:55] trust
[52:56] that it would do something for us and
[52:59] our walk our Christian
[53:01] walk we can understand the David the man
[53:07] supposed
[53:08] toly after God's Own
[53:14] Heart now David was a man just like you
[53:18] and I he went through things and had
[53:20] problems but yet God used him to
[53:24] destroy
[53:25] a bear and a lion and Goliath won many
[53:30] victories he was a warrior so much and
[53:34] so when Jesus Christ was called the son
[53:37] of David are you with me so David amen
[53:42] he can relate that God put him on a high
[53:47] standard a high
[53:50] pedicle God saw in David the qualities
[53:56] but yet David wasn't perfect yet David
[53:58] had all kind of things that was going on
[54:00] in his life David had problems amen he
[54:05] had battles he had to fight within
[54:07] himself amen he was de he dealt with
[54:10] situations and problem that he had to
[54:16] face though he was God's anointed though
[54:18] he was chosen and though God wanted him
[54:20] to be king though God gave him so many
[54:23] victories and blessed him so much
[54:26] sometimes in God's blessing sometime we
[54:28] get a little up the road in our
[54:30] Christian walk and sometimes things
[54:32] happen in our lives
[54:36] amen sometimes we lose Victory he won
[54:40] the battles out there being a warrior
[54:42] but the victory within himself sometimes
[54:44] we lose
[54:46] that maybe we want the victory over uh
[54:49] drugs and alcohol and you know things
[54:52] like that but we lose victory in other
[54:53] areas amen
[54:56] each and every one of us have our own
[54:59] failures and our own
[55:02] successes so it it's things that we must
[55:06] conquer in
[55:08] ourselves that is our truth from the
[55:11] inward
[55:12] part things within us that we have to
[55:16] fight things within us that we got to
[55:18] get Victory and got to conquer and got
[55:20] to
[55:23] overcome you and every one of us to deal
[55:26] with dealt with different
[55:28] situations your problem and your thing
[55:31] that go you are fighting and your battle
[55:33] may not be mine but each and every one
[55:35] of us have things that we have to
[55:39] face we must conquer we must repent
[55:44] of sometimes our repentances are
[55:46] constantly
[55:48] repenting the Bible says we must confess
[55:51] our faults one to another amen if we
[55:54] conf confess our sins he's faithful and
[55:56] just to forgive us our sin amen are you
[55:59] with
[56:02] me but I believe that David dealt with
[56:06] true
[56:10] repentance he realized that the best
[56:13] hands that I'm goingon to fall in I
[56:15] rather fall in the hands of if I fall in
[56:18] the hands of man that I'm going be in
[56:21] bad shape so Nathan said who hand in
[56:24] other words who you want to judge you he
[56:28] said you know you can't let your enemies
[56:31] you can't let your friend I want let God
[56:33] judge
[56:35] me you know and I I believe each and
[56:38] every one of us know God is a just judge
[56:41] and he judged fairly amen now I might in
[56:45] my best interest and no matter how much
[56:48] I love you and care for you I might if I
[56:52] had to do the judg and I might make a
[56:54] mistake
[56:56] I might let one go free and the other
[56:58] one I might oh give the
[57:03] DraStic you know but if I let
[57:07] God do the
[57:10] judging I knew he he knows what each and
[57:13] everyone uh uh needs to be corrected
[57:19] amen because God don't judge us just to
[57:23] uh punish us but God
[57:25] amen bring judgment that we might be
[57:28] corrected
[57:30] amen he allows amen uh things amen that
[57:36] come forth and the rod of
[57:41] Correction so you wonder why you face
[57:43] certain Tas and certain trials certain
[57:45] tribulations certain things you go
[57:47] through in life because God knows what
[57:49] it takes to mold your character
[57:53] am because in this age I keep saying
[57:57] this is the age of perfection God won't
[58:00] settle with nothing less than being
[58:03] perfect God don't want a a a a church
[58:07] that's imperfect it it's a church
[58:09] without spot ranker or blemish or any
[58:12] such thing God deals with Holiness and
[58:16] he's requiring Holiness he he's required
[58:19] you to be holy to be
[58:23] perfect uh nobody's perfect but that's
[58:26] what God required be you perfect as your
[58:29] father which is in heaven is
[58:31] perfect are you with me and nobody it's
[58:34] Worf it h pardon
[58:37] me if God is requiring it it must be
[58:42] possible if God said be then he must it
[58:46] must be a way in which we can be
[58:49] perfect so David here
[58:52] faced a problem
[58:55] he said behold I was shapen in
[58:59] iniquity and sin that my mother
[59:01] conceived
[59:03] me in other words I was
[59:06] born a
[59:08] sinner every one of us been Born Sinner
[59:11] had nothing to do with
[59:13] it but because of Adam's sin all have
[59:16] sinned and come short of the glory of
[59:20] God we were born wrong that's why Jesus
[59:23] said except a man be born again again he
[59:25] cannot enter to the kingdom of God am
[59:29] yes amen so we all have need to be born
[59:34] again are you with
[59:36] me so the situation in our lives that we
[59:40] come before God we all can look at it
[59:43] and say Lord I need
[59:47] help Pride will cause you not to receive
[59:51] help and not to cry out I need help when
[59:54] we got a proud Spirit Esau amen sold his
[59:59] Birthright
[1:00:01] yes Cain killed evil because he couldn't
[1:00:04] not he wouldn't repent he wouldn't say
[1:00:06] I'm sorry Lord I I what I bought was
[1:00:10] wrong I want to do
[1:00:13] right came
[1:00:16] amen and that same Spirit
[1:00:18] today people often times are are are
[1:00:22] settled with failure when they can have
[1:00:27] success you know many times God said I
[1:00:30] made you the head and not the
[1:00:32] tail I made you the lender not the
[1:00:36] borer but because we are borrowers and
[1:00:38] not
[1:00:40] lenders and because we are tails are not
[1:00:43] the head that don't mean that's God's
[1:00:45] way of doing
[1:00:47] things God said I I want to bless you
[1:00:50] amen but God cannot bless you when
[1:00:53] you're cursing yourself amen amen amen
[1:00:56] are you up man when you cursing yourself
[1:00:59] how can God bless
[1:01:01] you are you with me but if you want to
[1:01:04] be
[1:01:05] blessed then God wants to bless
[1:01:09] you but many times we settle with our
[1:01:13] condition this is the way I am God don't
[1:01:16] want you to be the way you
[1:01:20] are he said I am the Potter you are the
[1:01:23] clay am
[1:01:25] you said Lord mold me and make me what
[1:01:27] you want me to
[1:01:28] be you know what what I need you know
[1:01:32] how what you want Lord and you want me
[1:01:35] to be perfect and God
[1:01:38] you
[1:01:42] so David
[1:01:44] says Purge me with his he said behold th
[1:01:49] desire truth from the inward part and in
[1:01:52] the hidden part thou shall make make me
[1:01:54] to know
[1:01:55] wisdom Purge me with hiss and I shall be
[1:02:00] what clean wash me and I shall be
[1:02:05] what if God does it see David had no
[1:02:09] means he knew I can't I can't help
[1:02:13] myself I can't help
[1:02:16] myself I realize how unclean I am but I
[1:02:21] cannot wash myself I cannot not clean
[1:02:25] myself so I ask you to do
[1:02:31] it see sometimes we have to ask God God
[1:02:35] I realize how sinful I
[1:02:38] am I I I'm undone Isaiah says I'm a man
[1:02:43] with unclean
[1:02:45] lips and I dwell among a people of
[1:02:50] uncleanness but Isaiah ask the Lord when
[1:02:54] the year King oai died he said I saw the
[1:02:57] Lord he was high and lifted up and his
[1:03:01] Twain did fill the
[1:03:04] temple amen when Isaiah saw his
[1:03:08] condition he realized how holy God was
[1:03:11] and how he was a man that's unclean lips
[1:03:15] he needed
[1:03:16] help God I need
[1:03:23] help
[1:03:25] yes and then the Lord took some cold
[1:03:28] from The Altar and he touched my
[1:03:32] lip amen God need to take some cold from
[1:03:35] The Altar and touch
[1:03:37] you when we see our condition God fire
[1:03:41] from The Altar and touch
[1:03:44] you God may you touch somebody this
[1:03:48] morning if you touch Isaiah God can you
[1:03:51] touch
[1:03:53] me amen I I'm undone if you can do it
[1:03:57] for them God do it for
[1:04:03] me God can do it for David what about
[1:04:06] you and
[1:04:11] I that he can make me wider than snow
[1:04:15] what is
[1:04:17] that we said what can
[1:04:21] wash amen nothing J nothing but the
[1:04:25] blood of
[1:04:27] Jesus
[1:04:28] Amen so that's what that's what we're
[1:04:30] dealing with the blood of
[1:04:32] Jesus without that blood we cannot be
[1:04:35] made wi of this
[1:04:37] snow back then David was asking of God
[1:04:41] to do something for him that only could
[1:04:44] be done through the blood of Jesus
[1:04:47] Amen David could get a temporary
[1:04:51] fix amen but to be made WI and
[1:04:56] snow amen I want to be clean up the
[1:05:00] Bible said you clean Through The Words
[1:05:02] which I spoken unto you he said sanctify
[1:05:05] them through thy truth Thy word is true
[1:05:09] Lord if I'm going be clean up I you got
[1:05:11] something to clean me
[1:05:13] well we got to be washed in the Water by
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:16] word are you with me amen the word can
[1:05:20] clean you doesn't matter how dir to you
[1:05:24] are how filthy you are the word can
[1:05:28] clean you
[1:05:32] up and if you want to be
[1:05:35] washed Amen in the
[1:05:37] blood amen you come to the right
[1:05:40] place to be
[1:05:44] washed not because you're in this
[1:05:46] building but the place that God is
[1:05:48] dealing with at your
[1:05:49] heart are you with
[1:05:52] me he said make me to hear Joy the eth
[1:05:58] verse and gladness that the bones which
[1:06:01] thou has broken May
[1:06:06] Rejoice hide thy face from my sin and
[1:06:10] blot out all of my
[1:06:13] iniquities
[1:06:15] right creating
[1:06:19] what not somebody
[1:06:21] else but I want you to create in
[1:06:28] me every now and then we got to look at
[1:06:31] ourselves the Bible says examine
[1:06:34] yourself and see whether you be in the
[1:06:36] faith or
[1:06:38] not look at your own self don't look at
[1:06:42] your brother's fault or your sister's
[1:06:44] fault or somebody else but let me see
[1:06:47] me can I look in the mirror and see my
[1:06:50] condition and can I come to a place that
[1:06:52] God I need help
[1:06:55] God I need
[1:06:57] you it's areas of my walk my spiritual
[1:07:02] walk that I
[1:07:07] need I need
[1:07:10] help but we all can walk out of here as
[1:07:13] go amen the word didn't affect me I was
[1:07:16] all right I'm already I'm I'm a
[1:07:18] Christian I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm
[1:07:21] Holy Ghost filled I'm five baptized I'm
[1:07:23] all right right but I believe God can
[1:07:26] touch each and every one of
[1:07:28] us from the pull pit to the back
[1:07:31] door amen I I believe we all need
[1:07:34] help I believe we all got something that
[1:07:37] we said God have mercy on
[1:07:39] me God I need
[1:07:42] help I need you to forgive me Lord I
[1:07:45] need
[1:07:46] help Lord have mercy on me
[1:07:52] Lord sometimes we hit a a s we Justified
[1:07:56] as though we never done it and I and I
[1:07:59] often times say you done
[1:08:01] it yeah you done it you need
[1:08:05] help to stop doing it are you with me
[1:08:09] but if you Justified though you never
[1:08:11] done it you keep on doing it are you
[1:08:14] with me no place for
[1:08:17] repentance but I believe the gospel got
[1:08:19] to be simple
[1:08:21] sometime we put it way up there but
[1:08:23] people ain't got there
[1:08:25] yet are you with
[1:08:27] me
[1:08:31] simplify I believe blessed is the man
[1:08:34] whom the Lord would not impute
[1:08:37] iniquity a sin
[1:08:40] amen yeah that's all right but the man
[1:08:43] coming this way he's coming the
[1:08:46] repentance way creating me a clean heart
[1:08:49] oh God and
[1:08:52] what
[1:08:54] after God clean you

[1:09:01] first create in me a clean heart till
[1:09:04] your heart ready for it if your heart
[1:09:07] ain't ready for God you can confess with
[1:09:09] your mouth all you want but you got to
[1:09:12] believe in your
[1:09:13] heart before you can be saved because if
[1:09:17] you don't believe it in your heart you
[1:09:18] confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ but he said you got to believe it
[1:09:22] in your heart

[1:09:28] you got to recognize that I'm a center I

[1:09:40] salvation and jump into
[1:09:43] Perfection the
[1:09:45] message they leave the principles and
[1:09:47] they go to Perfection but we got to get

[1:09:56] nowhere your life always going to be
[1:09:59] full of ups and downs twists and turns
[1:10:03] and Lord God it's going to be a messy R
[1:10:06] but if you get the foundation
[1:10:09] right amen he said if the foundation be
[1:10:12] destroyed what can the righteous do
[1:10:15] that's righten are you with me but we
[1:10:18] get it right if I come to Jesus the
[1:10:21] right way if I acknowledge my
[1:10:23] transgression if I tell God I need you

[1:11:11] one and it reads and the Lord spake unto
[1:11:14] Moses
[1:11:17] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[1:11:20] saying a soul shall sin through a
[1:11:23] ignorance against any of The
[1:11:25] Commandments of the Lord concerning
[1:11:27] things which ought not to be done and
[1:11:30] shall do against any of
[1:11:34] them if the priest that is Anointed do
[1:11:37] sin according to the sin of the people
[1:11:41] then let him bring for his sin which he
[1:11:43] has send a young Bullock without blemish
[1:11:46] unto the Lord for a sin
[1:11:49] offering and he shall bring the bulock
[1:11:51] unto the door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:11:53] congregation before the Lord and shall
[1:11:56] lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and
[1:11:58] kill the bulock before the Lord and the
[1:12:01] priest that is Anointed shall take the
[1:12:03] Bullock's blood and bring it to the
[1:12:05] Tabernacle of the
[1:12:06] congregation and the priest shall dip
[1:12:08] his fingers in the blood and sprinkle of
[1:12:11] the blood seven times before the Lord
[1:12:14] before the veil of the sanctuary and the
[1:12:16] priest shall put his put some of the
[1:12:19] blood upon the horns of the altar a
[1:12:21] sweet incense before the Lord which is
[1:12:24] in the Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:12:26] and shall pour
[1:12:28] all the blood of the bulock at the
[1:12:31] bottom of the altar of the burnt
[1:12:33] offering which is at the door of the
[1:12:35] Tabernacle of the congregation I'm going
[1:12:37] tell you something the
[1:12:41] priest if you sin and you bring the
[1:12:45] Bullock to the
[1:12:49] priest this Bullock is taking your place
[1:12:54] it's your
[1:12:55] sin the animal didn't do nothing if you
[1:12:59] bring the lamb and you bring it before
[1:13:01] the priest and give it to the priest the
[1:13:03] animal didn't do nothing then he talked
[1:13:06] about it you bring two
[1:13:08] birs two
[1:13:11] doves and he said now you took take one
[1:13:15] and you kill
[1:13:16] one and you take the blood of that one
[1:13:19] that you killed and you dip the other
[1:13:21] one in the blood

[1:13:41] blood of Jesus to wash you make you
[1:13:45] clean then you can go

[1:13:52] die for your sin
[1:13:54] and you had to be clean and forgiven of
[1:13:57] your sin that's only through the blood
[1:13:59] of
[1:14:01] Jesus you can go free amen the Bullock
[1:14:05] took your

[1:14:28] mean what Calvary means but once you
[1:14:31] realize that I couldn't help
[1:14:34] myself but because of Jesus the Lamb of
[1:14:38] God he take away the SS of the world

[1:15:34] comfortable enough to say that I'm
[1:15:37] saved you will never feel comfortable
[1:15:40] enough to say that you're saved unless

[1:16:14] away the sins of the
[1:16:19] world are you with
[1:16:21] me now your salvation is not hinged and

[1:16:33] done whether it's good or whether it's
[1:16:35] bad it your salvation is not based on
[1:16:38] that it's based on what he done for
[1:16:42] you amen you will never be good

[1:17:42] already
[1:17:44] done I mean he
[1:17:46] died for the sins of the whole world yes
[1:17:51] amen but he said who shall will
[1:17:53] let him
[1:17:56] come I'm going tell you it's free
[1:18:00] salvation is free you don't have to pay

[1:18:40] try to condemn

[1:19:20] our sins not for ours only but for the
[1:19:22] whole world amen amen now if we have to
[1:19:25] make a mistake we don't sin
