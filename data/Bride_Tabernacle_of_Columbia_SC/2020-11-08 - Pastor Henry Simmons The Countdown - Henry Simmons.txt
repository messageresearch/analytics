24th chapter as we stand for the reading of the word god is good amen the world is in trouble the nations are in trouble but how to get out the trouble praise god no matter what the world is going through god said that you and i are letting out your heart be troubled for if you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house in my father's kingdom there are many palaces if i were not so i would have told you and i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also amen you got something to look up for look up because your redemption draws now amen jesus is coming amen [Music] matthew 24 and 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the building of the temple and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mountain of olives the disciples came unto him privily saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world may god bless the reader which word you may be seated the question was in the conclusion concerning the end of the world because it was something that they knew were it was to happen the end of the world was to come when we talk about the end of the world we're talking about the cosmos the world order that we know the world system as we know one day it would come to an end peter 4 seeing it he said i saw they meant the world being on fire the elements melt with the fervent heat he saw that this cosmos the world system would be burnt up but he said nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth way in dwelleth righteousness god amen he said it's not slight concerning his promises as some men do count slackness but he's long suffering to us lord not willing that any shall perish but that all should come to repentance i trust this morning that we are come to repentance amen that the long suffering of god is salvation amen god is suffering long for he knows them that are his god is waiting on that last election to come in before the door is shut amen and there'll be no more coming in because one day it'll all be over talk to you this morning concerning the countdown is on the countdown many years ago god's servant talks about three minutes to midnight the world's scientific world had determined that amen it was three minutes to midnight and oftentimes those terminologies are changed concerning the events sometimes they're put and hold or just a man in check stalemate and just stand still for a while then all of a sudden is there's a a stir again and i said it's later than we think it is the countdown is on the president-elect biden realized the condition of the world and he realized that if the world does not get help that it'll all be over europe and germany and all over the world they meant the virus looked like it's taken another turn and now if man cannot handle this virus quickly and shorter than the world as we know would be no more we will go into other chaos because the economical system was crashed we have to do something about the condition the countdown is on they said many times it's three minutes to midnight i said it's almost midnight we're almost there brother sister we almost we can start counting down now how long will it be before it's all over but the countdown for you and i zoned for the rapture countdown is owned for the great battle of armageddon president-elect biden says that we're going to depend on the scientific world to give us an ounce and solution to our problems in the environment and in the virus folks are looking for a solution we got to do something to stop it we cannot take too much more of this i'm saying brother and sister when will we get in panic move when will we get to a place that uh they meant the world is getting in planet moon where they'll do something drastically see when you panic sometimes you do something that you would normally do and sometimes you will try to help yourself but you end up hurting yourself sometimes when the house is on fire instead of escaping the fire sometimes folk will run into the fire when you win panic move i wonder when will the people of the earth and the political leaders in the world scientists get in pain and move so they'll try all kind of remedies i wonder if the president-elect biden would say uh this time amen like it was inanimal amen the king says let us all not eat not of our animals not any man or any beast and he put on sackcloth and ashes let us all repent let us stop amen for a moment and ask for god's mercy let us stop for a moment and say god amen forgive us oh spares lords but man go as far as he can go with his scientific experience experiments and he'll try all he can to save himself without the savior himself brother and sister amen the world needs a savior but they don't want jesus our savior they turned down the one the answer they're trying to get a solution but i i said if this pandemic and this virus is over i said there's another one on the way and if they get a handle to the economical situation it's another one on the way so i'm saying brothers and sisters we need to understand that you and i that have turned to god we turn and put our trust in our confidence in god god is the answer what will folks accept jesus ah it's something let me say this the countdown is on the out that are breathing we'll come to a crisis with the air pollution we don't do something to stop the pollution of the air and the water then there would be amen it would be so contaminated they meant to we can't breathe not putting your knee on a black man and said i can't breathe but the whole world is getting the condition that the air is so polluted amen that it would actually cause men to die water that we're drinking is so contaminated will be no answer i was glad to see the young children sing today and trusting that there is a future for them they meant to take over amen the position of myself and brother gordon and brother germa the young people can really come and there'll be a future for them but i don't know this morning whether there is a future i believe that is later than we think the countdown is on here which says the countdown for you and i is on for the rapture it says in revelation 19 for a moment revelation 19 7 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready amen his wife has made herself ready the countdown as we look at it in the days of martin luther in the reformation of justification looked like the corner wheat had fallen into the ground and died but it began to spring up in a blade form when uh men were in such darkness under jezebel religion so here we are emerge the just shall live by faith and we don't have to be under all kind of dogmas in creeds and under the barnache a man made traditions and rule martin luther had a reformation on and that was the just shall live by faith light began to come back to the body that was dead amen so life began to come back under amen we look at the horse and buggy days then from the horse and buggy we begin to increase until the automobile age the automobile age and we will find in wesleyan the methodists they had a hole in this standard it came to a time that the church went through sanctification sanctification did not deny justification it came now that after you save you need to live a clean life god amen said the countdown is on where are we going brother and sister we heard it for rapture we had it for rapture how are we going to get there we got to come through justification sanctification after that event we find that we went from the hearts and burgers meant to the automobile and from the automobile we began to the wright brothers and began to fly in the airplanes on the juice of the street black man by the name of seymour amen began to take the church to a higher level that when the baptism of the holy ghost began to fall and the supernatural began to happen and the gifts were restored back to the church the church was flying high thank god the church was flying in the supernatural but who that are flying in airplanes want to go back to horse and boogie praise god we have uh come to greater achievements who in the automobile want to go back to horace and boogie brother and sister i had my opportunity some years ago when i was a young man i had a stick i think we drove 24 or 32 hours or something like that straight three of us taking turns driving and we drove straight to phoenix uh tucson arizona after i got out there the second time driving cross country that texas got us the next time i said when we get out of texas i never flew on a plane i'mma try i said i'm gonna try i gotta get enough grace and enough faith to get on one of those planes but when i got on the plane i said i never drive that floor again are you with me because it was so much better flying in that airplane so brother and sister we got there so much faster and we were so much we were comfortable are you look man just sitting back and let the pilot take us there are you with me so brother and sister if you're ever amen get on the airplane automobiles nice well when you get on the airplane but that's what the church and once it's gone through the baptism of the holy ghost and the restoration of the gift flying in the supernatural and somebody wants you to go back to horse and buggy somebody wants you to just to go to the justification and that's all they want come on somebody we go up to pennsylvania and see them still with their horse and buggy and they're still applying the mule but it's good to get on one of those nice act conditioned tractors are you with me and plow the field so by the grace of god some folk want to live in the past but there are others that are understanding the countdown is on as the natural world is making progress then you and i in the spiritual world shall be making progress we should be getting closer and closer to our destination to where god want us to be he said be ye perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect god is amen bringing the church back to the word the bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen the bible said amen praise god that the wife and the husband of one this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church father make them one even as we are one and by one spirit are we baptized into one body the word marries the word are you with me we must become one with the word brother the countdown is on praise god as the world is looking as in the days of noah the scientific world amen has told no no you must be a false prophet we've looked through our intelligence and our scientific world said that it that would it will never rain but we're being warned that if we don't do something to stop global warming amen the world will amen begin to heat up they say they and there are others that are saying there's no sustain as global warming but nevertheless we understand the world is getting ready we cannot leave our destiny in the hands of scientists we cannot trust in the scientific world we must trust in the living god oh god i'm dependent on you i know it meant the world he means going through his chaotic conditioning and the world don't want to turn back to god but there must be a people on the earth that hearts have been turned back oh yes brother sister somebody that said lord amen i want to serve you lord lord i believe you're coming back i want to be ready oh yes i believe you're coming lord amen no they don't believe in the rain though they don't believe that fire would fall amen i believe that for you and i as believers we believe the world is coming to his end for he says i'll show you the signs of the end time amen when you amen see certain things began to happen they met concerning the fig tree and israel being restored back to a nation you know the summer is not even at the door they meant knowing that this generation shall not pass away until all things be fulfilled not only that he said as it was in the days of noah amen the scientists said it won't rain the people trusted the scientific world amen they didn't trust noah's message for the hour that he lived brother and sister nego would they accept they meant god's message for the hour that we live in
