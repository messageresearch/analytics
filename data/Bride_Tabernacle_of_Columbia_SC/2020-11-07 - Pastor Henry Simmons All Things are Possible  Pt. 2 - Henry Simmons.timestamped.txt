[27:36] we thank you lord god for the grace that
[27:39] you've given us
[27:41] lord it's late in the evening the sun
[27:43] gone down
[27:45] so many soldiers are battling
[27:48] the country's in our role the earth is
[27:51] quaking and shaking
[27:54] lord we just pray that you and all
[27:56] things

[28:26] god help us tonight help us to draw
[28:29] closer to you
[28:31] in jesus name we pray amen
[28:37] the book of matthew 28.
[28:44] sometimes we don't emphasize enough
[28:51] concerning the devil being defeated
[28:55] because that's one thing the devil would
[28:57] like to keep it away from us
[29:00] and he don't want us to realize that he
[29:02] is a defeated foe
[29:05] and he don't want us to really anchor
[29:07] our faith
[29:08] in the knowledge amen that the devil
[29:12] cannot do us any harm
[29:16] because he cannot cross the bloodline
[29:21] and so by the grace of god
[29:25] let us look at matthew 28
[29:30] and 16 then the 11 disciples went away
[29:34] into galilee into a mountain
[29:36] where jesus had appointed them and when
[29:39] they saw him they worshipped him
[29:42] but some doubted and jesus came
[29:45] and speak unto them saying all power
[29:49] is given me given unto me
[29:52] in heaven and in earth
[29:55] all power was given unto me
[29:58] in heaven and in earth
[30:03] by the grace of god jesus
[30:07] tonight got all power let us
[30:10] be seated jesus tonight got all power
[30:15] and if jesus have all power then what's
[30:17] left for the devil
[30:21] so i want to say the devil to you and i
[30:25] we understand that the devil has been
[30:28] stripped
[30:29] has been disarmed and the devil
[30:33] is defeated tonight because jesus said
[30:37] all
[30:37] power in heaven and earth is given unto
[30:40] me
[30:42] let me pick up a little bit where i left
[30:43] off on sunday
[30:45] uh revelation 1.
[30:54] and i believe he really wants the church
[30:57] to understand
[30:58] and to know that the keys in authority
[31:04] the prophet of god tells us when the
[31:06] witcher endo
[31:08] called samuel up from the dead
[31:11] and saul consulted with the witch
[31:17] because he couldn't get his prayer
[31:19] through
[31:21] to god so he went to which
[31:26] to the witch you know the prophet god
[31:29] said
[31:30] when people get desperate enough they
[31:31] eat out the garbage can
[31:33] they get hungry enough
[31:36] you know when you really desiring the
[31:39] supernatural in the power of god and
[31:41] the reality of god people are searching
[31:44] for the real god and they want to see
[31:46] the supernatural inaction and that's why
[31:50] so many people are going to meditation
[31:52] and
[31:52] going to all different types of uh
[31:55] eastern religions and all of that
[31:57] because they're seeking for a meditation
[31:59] there
[32:00] so they they got spirit guides and demon
[32:03] powers being led by them
[32:05] amen not realizing the consequences of
[32:08] that
[32:10] but the devil is defeated
[32:14] brother and sister amen
[32:17] i said we can go to jesus
[32:20] we can go to jesus but because the saw
[32:24] backslidden condition and the
[32:26] spiritual condition he was in amen
[32:30] you know instead of repenting
[32:33] and still uh you know david amen
[32:36] realized
[32:37] that he had made a mistake and what he
[32:40] had done was wrong
[32:43] he said i acknowledge my transgression
[32:44] little a lot of folks trying to get a
[32:46] hold of god but
[32:47] they can't get a hold of god because
[32:51] he meant they haven't left off
[32:54] the wicked stuff amen
[32:57] we must really amen uh surrender our
[33:00] lives totally
[33:01] to god
[33:05] we just can't come half-stepping and
[33:07] halfway to god we got a total surrender
[33:09] to god
[33:10] [Music]
[33:12] are you with me we want to see god's
[33:15] power we want to see the supernatural
[33:17] it's like pilate they slapped jesus said
[33:20] uh
[33:20] uh you know show us a miracle you know
[33:23] do something
[33:24] i mean they wanted to see a miracle they
[33:27] want to see god do
[33:28] something but look at them for what for
[33:30] sports for play
[33:34] and satan said that jesus if you be the
[33:36] son of god he didn't have to prove
[33:38] anything to the devil
[33:40] neither do you and i have to prove
[33:42] anything to the devil
[33:44] your very life ought to be a testimony
[33:47] of who you are
[33:50] are you with me so you let
[33:54] your life speak for you
[33:58] somebody said may the works i've done
[33:59] speak for me
[34:02] amen if jesus is living his life through
[34:04] you
[34:05] then you don't have to speak for
[34:06] yourself so many times we have to defend
[34:09] ourselves but you don't have to defend
[34:10] yourself
[34:11] when you're right are you with me
[34:15] it doesn't matter how many people he
[34:17] said
[34:18] they said uh the jesus what is
[34:22] truth amen
[34:25] jesus knew that he was the way the truth
[34:27] in the life and no man can come to the
[34:29] father but by him
[34:31] he knew he was he didn't have to prove
[34:35] amen to those his adversaries who he was
[34:40] amen the devil said we know thee who
[34:43] thou
[34:43] art are the son of god
[34:47] amen when they cried out allegiance said
[34:50] why
[34:51] you come to ten minutes before the time
[34:56] the demons recognized but men
[34:59] they didn't recognize who jesus was
[35:03] the bible said the devil bleed but he
[35:05] trembles
[35:07] are you with me and
[35:10] oftentimes amen if cain would have done
[35:13] right
[35:15] then god says you do what your brother
[35:18] evil did
[35:20] and you do right god's gonna bless you
[35:23] you know instead of folks doing right
[35:26] they want to accuse
[35:27] evil and they want to
[35:30] amen don't want to repent
[35:34] and come and say god i'm sorry
[35:38] and i want to do that which is right in
[35:40] your sight
[35:42] and i want to please you lord instead of
[35:45] pleasing the lord
[35:47] folks are so ready to
[35:50] amen want god to
[35:53] give respect to what they've given him
[35:58] are you with me and god said if you do
[36:01] right
[36:02] amen if not sin lies at the door
[36:06] oh you want me but folks want god to say
[36:10] amen what you've given me
[36:14] is all right and god said i don't want
[36:16] it
[36:18] it's not pleasing in my sight
[36:21] brother and sister we can't give up god
[36:23] anything
[36:25] think god's gonna say amen he's pleased
[36:28] with it
[36:29] i think god's gonna vindicate your life
[36:32] when you do it all kind of crooked and
[36:34] blasphemy stuff
[36:37] don't look for the supernatural don't
[36:40] look for
[36:40] god to come down and vindicate you
[36:48] but cain got upset with god
[36:51] and he hated his brother
[36:56] marvel not
[36:59] that we didn't tear it's got to go grow
[37:02] together
[37:03] in the same field amen
[37:10] knowing that it's two vines the true
[37:12] vine and the false fire
[37:15] are you with me brother sister amen
[37:19] but i want you to know the devil is
[37:21] defeated
[37:23] you just stand still and you'll watch
[37:26] god
[37:27] amen he said leave it alone in harvest
[37:30] time
[37:31] he sent forth the dangers and he'll do
[37:33] the separation ain't that right
[37:35] so why amen can we not understand
[37:39] that god knows what he's doing
[37:42] and god knows how to take care of
[37:44] business when his time come
[37:47] are you up here so brother and sister's
[37:50] best for you and i
[37:52] ain't meant to do what god has required
[37:55] of us
[37:56] as individuals let's do right
[38:01] let's do the thing that we know that god
[38:03] is requiring of us as individuals as
[38:05] christians
[38:07] amen
[38:11] somebody said well god why did you
[38:14] accept evil
[38:15] and you don't set mine what god says
[38:17] that's my business
[38:19] that's not the part of power over the
[38:21] clay you know oftentimes i say
[38:23] look like what david did was
[38:27] it was it was very bad he sent your eyes
[38:31] on the battlefield
[38:32] put him out there first i mean let him
[38:35] get killed
[38:36] i took his wife committed adultery did
[38:38] all of that stuff
[38:40] saul brought back a guy the king
[38:43] and uh some of some animals and so forth
[38:46] now to you to the average man
[38:49] eyes and looking at the word you don't
[38:52] have a right
[38:53] to judge what how god does things
[38:57] you say well look at what david did that
[39:00] god let and said david is a man after my
[39:03] own
[39:03] heart i'm gonna tell you brother and
[39:07] sister god can do what he wants
[39:09] has not the power powder power over the
[39:12] clay
[39:13] to make one vessel to honor another the
[39:15] dishonor
[39:16] can the things form say that he did him
[39:18] that form why has thou
[39:20] met you know god can do what he wants
[39:24] brother sister
[39:27] he said concerning uh esau and jacob
[39:30] before the children that were born
[39:32] he said he saw have i hated and jacob
[39:36] have a love
[39:38] but look at it look at the character
[39:41] jacob

[40:57] getting us out of the condition that we
[40:59] were in
[41:00] if it wasn't for the mercy of the good
[41:02] lord where would we be
[41:05] but it was because the good lord had
[41:07] mercy on us
[41:09] praise god amen
[41:15] so don't try to figure out god with all
[41:19] your figuring don't try to figure him
[41:20] out
[41:23] revelation 1 and 17
[41:26] it says and when i saw him
[41:31] i fell at his feet is dead
[41:34] and he laid his right hand upon me
[41:36] saying
[41:37] unto me fear not i'm the first in the
[41:40] lies
[41:41] i'm he that liveth and what and i was
[41:45] dead
[41:45] you know some it somehow
[41:49] amen the devil thought that in killing
[41:53] jesus he was going to win
[41:57] he thought he was re he really got him
[42:02] but he did not you know he he said you
[42:05] know what that deceiver said that in
[42:07] three days you're gonna get up
[42:09] they said now we're gonna put a a big
[42:11] stone let's
[42:13] he probably got so many soldiers and
[42:15] they got a great stone
[42:17] and they rolled and made sure he didn't
[42:19] get up
[42:21] are you with me and then they put guards
[42:24] down
[42:25] where the uh the disciples couldn't come
[42:27] and steal him away then they're right
[42:31] but jesus amen he was uh
[42:34] not subject amen uh to any man
[42:38] or to any group of soldiers or whatever
[42:41] but he had to fulfill what was written
[42:43] of him
[42:46] are you with me and he knew what the
[42:48] scripture said about him
[42:51] amen he knew that amen the third day he
[42:54] was getting up
[42:55] no matter how how oh hallelujah
[42:58] i don't care how much the stone wall i
[43:01] don't care how many soldiers was there
[43:03] jesus was getting up
[43:06] amen praise god hallelujah the devil did
[43:10] not know
[43:11] in lifting up jesus actually
[43:14] amen jesus was making a show of him
[43:17] openly
[43:18] [Music]
[43:19] amen because he said if i be lifted up
[43:23] he didn't know amen that he was falling
[43:25] into a trap
[43:28] amen the bible said had he known he
[43:31] would not have crucified him
[43:33] if he knew that he was going to be
[43:35] stripped of all his power amen
[43:38] and all of his authority he wouldn't
[43:40] never kill jesus
[43:43] oh you wouldn't be because when he
[43:45] killed jesus he kept the wrong one
[43:49] amen because jesus hadn't done no wrong
[43:53] amen adam was innocent he was innocent
[43:56] in the beginning
[43:57] they were without sin but
[44:00] when they sinned they met
[44:03] then they fell from god
[44:07] and god was requiring amen
[44:11] the weight is the sin was death never
[44:14] the penalty
[44:17] so there was no one that could redeem
[44:21] man back because all have sinned and
[44:24] come shallow the glory of god there was
[44:26] no way we could get back to god
[44:31] but god himself saw the need of
[44:35] redemption somebody to bring us back to
[44:38] god
[44:40] and now jeremiah said it was such the
[44:43] heavens searched
[44:43] up beneath the earth and there was
[44:45] nobody
[44:48] so when they got through such and there
[44:49] was nobody that could do it
[44:51] so god himself
[44:53] [Music]
[44:55] amen god himself
[44:59] had to come down in the form of flesh
[45:04] so god created a body that he could get
[45:07] in
[45:09] and he was called the son of god
[45:12] or you would be so he was the beginning
[45:15] of the creation of god
[45:18] so by the grace of god god coming down
[45:20] to do something
[45:23] oh lord i'm so glad that god came down
[45:29] to show himself that i can do all things
[45:34] all things are possible to them to
[45:36] believe
[45:38] god wanted to redeem us bring us back to
[45:40] god
[45:42] brothers and sisters this god had a plan
[45:46] amen and god knew what he was doing amen
[45:49] the disciples could not fully understand
[45:52] what god had done
[45:55] amen he had to come after his
[45:57] resurrection
[45:58] and walk through the door and tell them
[46:01] amen
[46:03] it was something about the way it broke
[46:05] bread and their eyes would open and they
[46:06] knew him
[46:09] there was something about amen thomas
[46:11] wasn't there
[46:12] they couldn't hardly believe that the
[46:14] devil was defeated
[46:18] look thomas you know i don't believe
[46:21] amen because i saw him die
[46:25] amen i know they nailed him amen oh he
[46:28] was crucified

[46:50] had spoken and prophesied concerning him
[46:55] the songs and the prophets and he began
[46:57] to open the understanding that they
[46:59] might understand the scriptures
