[44:28] the book of uh Proverbs
[44:38] 3 praise God we don't know what the
[44:41] world is is going to do
[44:45] next but we know that
[44:48] God has all things in
[44:52] control three and one it says my son
[44:56] forget not my
[44:58] law but let thy
[45:02] heart keep my
[45:05] Commandments for length of days and long
[45:08] life and peace shall they add to
[45:12] thee let not mercy and Truth forsake
[45:16] thee bind them about thy neck write them
[45:19] upon the table of thine heart so shall
[45:23] thou find favor and good understanding
[45:27] in the sight of God and man trust in the
[45:31] Lord with all thine heart lean not to
[45:34] thy own understanding and all thy ways
[45:37] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[45:40] path God bless you read word you may be
[45:46] seated it says in
[45:48] the seventh verse be not wise in thy own
[45:53] eyes fear the lord
[45:58] it's getting some feedback from
[46:01] somewhere I don't
[46:07] know God
[46:10] bless oh that's
[46:12] it oh okay I was trying to understand
[46:16] where that was coming from
[46:19] amen therefore ver says it shall be heal
[46:23] to thy Naval and Marrow to thy bones
[46:26] honor the Lord with thy substance and
[46:29] with the first fruits of all thine
[46:32] increase so shall thy bonds be filled
[46:36] with plenty and thy press shall burst
[46:39] out with new
[46:41] wine we go back and to the fifth verse
[46:45] says trust in the Lord
[46:47] with
[46:50] what and lean not to
[46:53] what I like to just talk talk to you a
[46:56] little bit this morning by lean not to
[47:00] your own
[47:03] understanding because often times we see
[47:07] ourselves
[47:09] and if we got any kind of intelligence
[47:13] at all then we kind of trust in what we
[47:18] think how we think things ought to
[47:22] go as soon as a child reach you know
[47:26] teenage they they began to think that
[47:29] they understand a little about
[47:34] life sometimes they think the parents
[47:37] don't know what they
[47:40] know they don't understand the peer
[47:43] pressure and the things that they're
[47:44] going through so they kind of look and
[47:48] lean to their understanding of
[47:52] Life what we understand in the Book of
[47:55] Genesis
[47:57] genis the Bibles tell Eve and Adam not
[48:01] the touch of the tree of knowledge and
[48:02] good and
[48:03] evil but we understand that they chose
[48:07] their
[48:08] own
[48:11] understanding Eve chose
[48:14] reasoning over the word of
[48:17] God when God has spoken don't you touch
[48:21] it don't you eat unless you
[48:24] die you know when God says something to
[48:27] us it behooves us to believe what God
[48:31] Said but often times in in
[48:35] man since the days of Adam and Eve we
[48:39] were born in sin shaping an
[48:43] iniquity and it just behooves man at all
[48:46] the times to reason I I want to do it my
[48:51] way I I I I believe I know what's best
[48:54] for me
[48:56] I believe I know how to this is my
[49:01] life this is my
[49:05] life mama can't dictate to me Daddy
[49:09] can't dictate to me but this is my
[49:12] life you don't tell me how to live my
[49:15] life because it's
[49:17] mine y'all ever heard that
[49:21] before maybe we didn't say it just like
[49:24] that but that's what we meant
[49:26] this is my life if I make a mess of it
[49:30] then it's my
[49:33] mess but it's
[49:37] mine but the Bible tells us in Songs
[49:39] Know ye not that the Lord he is God it
[49:44] is he that made us and not
[49:49] we s are you with
[49:52] me so your life is only the life that
[49:57] God has given
[50:00] you so the the life that you think you
[50:03] are have a right to Amen to defame and
[50:08] to destroy it's only the life that God
[50:10] gave
[50:12] us are you with me so often times we
[50:16] take our life in our own
[50:20] hand and we have our own
[50:23] devices we do what we feel that we want
[50:29] to do with our
[50:32] lives I'm just going to do it my
[50:35] way I take my life in my own hand
[50:39] because it's
[50:41] mine it's mine it belong to me I can do
[50:44] what I want with it I can do good I can
[50:47] do evil I can do what I want it's
[50:51] mine nobody tells me how to live nobody
[50:54] tells me what what to
[50:56] do the kind of world we live
[50:59] in is what you want to be if you want to
[51:02] be a
[51:03] frog everybody says that's your business
[51:06] do what you want it's your thing you can
[51:09] do what you
[51:11] want so people choose to do all kind
[51:16] of all kind of what we call crazy stuff
[51:21] because it's theirs they they
[51:24] think they don't know at any moment at
[51:27] any time God said that's
[51:29] enough that is
[51:32] enough and God can cut you off like that
[51:37] aren't you glad that we serve a merciful
[51:40] god amen a God that can just speak just
[51:44] like when Jesus was here and and they
[51:48] decide to kill Jesus and Jesus said I
[51:51] got power to call 12 Legion of angels
[51:55] and you trying to uh take my life you
[51:58] know what I'm
[52:00] saying he said no man take my life I lay
[52:02] it
[52:03] down and I got the power to pick it up
[52:07] again amen God is G so I want to talk
[52:11] about lean not to your own understanding
[52:13] in Hebrews uh 11 and3 uh because uh
[52:17] often
[52:18] times we we look to our own
[52:21] understanding but but in Hebrews 11 and3
[52:24] it says
[52:28] uh through
[52:31] faith we
[52:33] what through faith we understand without
[52:37] faith you don't
[52:39] understand but through faith we
[52:43] understand
[52:45] amen it takes you beli in the word faith
[52:49] come by hearing and hearing by the word
[52:52] of
[52:53] God we have to have faith in what God
[52:56] word
[52:59] says then we can
[53:02] understand we cannot understand God
[53:06] except we have faith we don't understand
[53:10] life
[53:12] amen we don't understand how to live we
[53:15] don't understand see because we lean to
[53:18] our own understanding I every man does
[53:23] what he think is right in his own
[53:26] eyes the Bible said uh there's a
[53:28] generation that are pure in their own
[53:32] eyes but yet they have not been washed
[53:35] from their
[53:36] filthiness are you with me see in our
[53:39] own eyes we do what we want to
[53:43] do it's in our own eyes I'm doing what I
[53:47] want to
[53:49] do because it's my
[53:52] life it's belong to me if I want to do
[53:56] this let me do
[53:59] it are you with
[54:01] me sad sad
[54:04] sad if God was looking down and made man
[54:08] in his own image and his own likeness
[54:11] and he looked at what go man is doing
[54:14] with the life that God gave
[54:17] him would you if you were God would you
[54:19] be pleased with this world in the
[54:22] condition that it was in would you look
[54:24] down upon man and you said everything is
[54:28] good Lord I'm I would he be pleased
[54:31] would you be pleased with the way people
[54:35] are are are living their lives what they
[54:38] are doing with their lives would you be
[54:40] pleased even you and
[54:44] yourself may look at your own self and
[54:47] you're not even pleased with the things
[54:49] that you might
[54:53] do are you with me
[54:56] you can say I do some stuff and I don't
[54:58] even know why I do
[55:02] it but I still do it why because I don't
[55:06] got I don't have power over what I
[55:10] do I do
[55:13] it Paul said the things I would not that
[55:16] I do and the things that I want to do I
[55:19] don't
[55:20] do he said I find then that there's a
[55:22] walk going on in my mind amen when I
[55:26] desire to do good evil is present with
[55:28] me are you with me so often times we we
[55:34] in ourselves want to do the right thing
[55:37] but it's beyond our power to do
[55:41] it are you with me in our ability we
[55:45] want to do it but we find ourselves
[55:48] wrestling I don't want to do this no
[55:50] more I want to do right I want to live
[55:52] right I want to please your God
[55:55] God but I find a walk going on I find
[56:00] that I I can't seem to have Victory I
[56:03] can't seem to overcome my problems my
[56:07] condition the thing that I know that's
[56:09] going to hle me from the kingdom of God
[56:12] the thing that I know that's going to
[56:14] take my life the thing that I I know
[56:17] won't let me go to heaven but I find
[56:21] myself doing it and I know God is not
[56:24] pleased with you
[56:26] but I can't help
[56:31] myself
[56:34] see something would be vastly wrong with
[56:37] our
[56:38] mind if we saw an 18 Willer coming down
[56:42] the
[56:43] street and it's going about 50 miles an
[56:47] hour and for us to run out in front of
[56:51] it it'll be
[56:53] something wrong but we see a train
[56:58] coming wide
[57:00] open and and you going to get on the
[57:05] track say I don't believe the train
[57:07] going run over me I don't believe that
[57:10] 18 Willer can hit me you know it's so
[57:14] many things in life that you think that
[57:17] you a you're bigger than that 18 wheel
[57:22] line the train come on come on I'm super
[57:25] man I'm wonder the woman I'll stop
[57:29] it are you with me those imaginary
[57:33] things we find ourselves
[57:36] recognizing I'm only
[57:39] human I'm just a
[57:41] man but Lord let me for thy sake live
[57:45] one day at a time are you with
[57:48] me so I I go back here and
[57:53] says through faith we understand you
[57:57] can't understand god without
[58:01] faith without faith it's impossible to
[58:03] please
[58:06] him we understand that the world were
[58:08] framed by the what word of God without
[58:12] the word of God you don't exist I don't
[58:14] exist the world don't
[58:17] exist so that the things which are seen
[58:21] were not made of
[58:23] what things that do
[58:27] appear if you're going to understand God
[58:29] you're going to have to have
[58:35] faith often times people say God don't
[58:38] exist Does that mean God don't
[58:41] exist I don't believe in God does that
[58:43] mean that God is Not
[58:46] godone are you with me if God is not
[58:52] dictated whether you believe God exists
[58:55] or not whether you believe there is a
[58:57] God or not God's still
[58:59] God and God still
[59:02] exists doesn't matter to you he don't
[59:05] exist but
[59:07] amen nature even tells you if you look
[59:10] up in the sky and you see the stars you
[59:12] see the Sun and the Moon and you see the
[59:14] mountains and the trees amen nature you
[59:17] tell you it come from
[59:19] somewhere are you with me so John uh 3
[59:23] and three
[59:25] uh St John 3
[59:27] and3 so though though man in his
[59:30] intellectual
[59:31] knowledge
[59:33] amen lean not to all this intellectual
[59:37] knowledge we go to school and we may get
[59:39] a bachelor degree a doctor degree or
[59:42] whatever and and often times men lean to
[59:47] their their learning their education uh
[59:49] the uh sometimes man leads amen maybe
[59:53] says I'm a Street man and I I I I come
[59:56] up in the streets man and I don't lean
[59:59] to that get you in
[1:00:02] prison are you with me get you
[1:00:06] killed are you with me leaning to your
[1:00:09] own understanding amen take your father
[1:00:11] and farther away from
[1:00:14] God if you want to get far away from God
[1:00:17] keep on trusting in yourself but the
[1:00:20] Bible says lean not to your own
[1:00:23] understanding but in all thy ways what
[1:00:27] amen is then it tell you to trust in the
[1:00:29] Lord with what all thy heart amen and
[1:00:33] that's what it's all about brother
[1:00:34] sister friend it is whether or not we
