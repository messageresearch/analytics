amen amen what you need god's got it this morning amen he's got everything you need you believe that this morning amen let's look at the book of matthew by god's grace matthew 11. god is good amen matthew 11 will begin at the first verse when you got it's amen and it reads and it came to pass when jesus had made an ending an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities and now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he or thou he that should come or do we look for another you may be seated i'm gonna continue reading a little further down fourth verse here it says jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again these things which ye do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk and the lepers are cleansed and the death here and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel preached unto them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaking in the wind but what weren't you out to see a man clothed in fire and raiment behold they that were they they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses but what went ye out to sea for a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily i say unto you among them that are born of a woman a woman there have not risen a greater than john the baptist not with notwithstanding he is the he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffering violence and the violence take it by force for all the prophets and the law of the prophets and the law prophesied unto john and if you receive will receive it this is elias which was for to come may god it blessed to the reading of his word this morning by grace of god just for a moment i don't tend to be long and i entitled i titled a message this morning what went ye out to see amen what went ye out to see we know that here in the scriptures and the setting of the scriptures and how you know john came to us came to a point in his life where you know he had done whatever god asked him to do and i guess he i believe he lived though the way that and god asked him to do and he fulfilled this mission even how you know when jesus stepped on the scene he says behold i must decrease and he must increase he said you don't follow me no more but he is the one that i've been telling you about that's coming you know the to carry on him the sins of the whole world and aren't you glad of that today that god came to carry out carry all of our burdens you know sometimes we carry things that we ought not be carrying come on when all we got to do is say lord i know you came to carry these things so sometimes i believe that we got to get back into that place in our lives that at once before we didn't want to carry nothing but we got on our knees to god in prayer and we gave it all to him and he carried it didn't he come on and sometimes you got to get back to that place to where you get down and you say lord i can't carry this load by myself god i can't carry these burdens and these things that are the uh the trials and tribulations i'm going through lord they too heavy for me come on and then he comes and he says what come under me all you that are heavy laying with burden and i'll give you rest he says take my yoke upon you and learn to me come on for my yoke is easy and my burden is light god here are all these burdens i got god i want you to carry them you know what the devil's trick is don't you know god came to take all that weight off you he come to release you of all that pain and all of the weight come on you know the bible said talks about his righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost it didn't say weight depression and all these things but it's righteousness peace and joy but what the devil uh does he tricks you and i through mind battles and or what not to get us to carry these these burdens carry these weights and these things these trials in these tribulations he wants you to fight your own battles but once you get to revelation that the battle ain't yours and that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord it ain't nothing that will come your way that god ain't even already solved he already worked it out he got the answer for it all you got to do is praise god in the midst of the storm come on and let god carry those burdens i was back there uh meditating to myself i said lord i'm giving it all to you i'm giving it all to you god i'm giving you all my words i'm giving you my children i'm giving you all of my thoughts and my problems giving it all to you lord hallelujah and once you give it all to him watch god work it out come on and don't don't pay attention to how the situation is unfolding and and all those things come on because that don't mean nothing remember god's got it all in control the ship might look like it's sinking but long as jesus is in the ship come on it might go under but he'll raise it back up again how many believe that this morning i believe that with all of my heart why because i'm a witness today that god he's not a failure he never failed come on so i said what went you ought to see you know we find that uh john you know pointing them out said they said this is the one and but then we find that john gets to a place in his christian journey down in prison he got thrown in prison some say that jesus never even went to visit him so he got to the place the way he was down in the dumps come on sometimes thinking maybe in his mind just just kind of dramatizing it maybe in his mind thinking all that i'm doing i'll uh give my whole life to live for the lord and now here i am in prison and he ain't even come see about me come on is god forgot about me matter of fact asking the people we'll go ask him is he the one or shall we look for another why because john had preached a messiah that was going to come with a fan in his hand come on john preached a messiah that was coming with an axe laid at the root of the tree but yet when he saw jesus come down to jordan river he looked like a meek and a lowly man a man that was walking that didn't even seem like he could hold his head up a man of a few words come on but yet john preached that when he come it was going to be fire hallelujah ain't that what he preached come on so i could see john now in prison like the prophet of god was saying his juniper tree experience a juniper tree experience well thinking you know i haven't done all that and yet where is god i mean why he hadn't come recognize me come on but it's something about i want to say to you this morning you don't you don't you can't beat god given come on god ain't gonna never forget your labor and love the labor of that that god that you're doing come on god ain't gonna forget that god will never forget you talked about how you know the animals and all the people even people they might forget their children but god will never forget you you grave in them in the palm of his hand come on god's got you in his mind come on and you he can't never forget you so no matter where you are remember i did what all god asked me to do come on and now like paul said i know that there's a crown of life laid up for me i'm going to nero's shocking block but god ain't forsaking me why because he is his word and he said in his word that i'll never leave you nor forsake you no heaven and earth will pass away my word i'll still be here hallelujah and i'm part of that word hallelujah do y'all believe that this morning come on so god i'll never forget about you come on what it is that's the devil playing tricks on your mind remember when when that roll is called up yonder i believe my name will be on that roll and i pray to god this morning each and every one of our names be on that road that's all we come to today to live our lives for give our all come on we didn't just come here for just for the motion but we come here to make preparation for our future home come on where do we come to prayer service and all those things what do we live such godly lives for not to just say we hoping come on and all these things but in our souls something says i know that my redeemer lives in your soul something says i know that if i could hold out just a little while longer i know if i could just break through all of the darkness in the hour that we that we have around us today i know hallelujah something in your soul screaming out i know if i can break through all of the criticism i know if i can break through all the persecution i know hallelujah that my redeemer livers hallelujah do you believe that today come on something your soul got to ring out that's what that's what's driving us as individuals something down in the deep come on because the flesh is is weak but the spirit is willing what's driving us the the holy one come on that inside something on the inside keep nudging you telling you to go ahead come on you struggle you battle you're fighting come on i know you're tired but keep fighting to in the morning keep holding out hallelujah and i don't know about you but i want to hold out come on i said lord help me to hold up until my change comes i'm strong i'm battling i'm fighting but help me hold up hallelujah don't let me fall god i'm gonna lean on you oh jesus said if you lean on me i won't let you fall hallelujah oh jesus how many want to lean on god this morning come on well it says that what it is john got to that place and we know that you know in that place where he was but god didn't forget about him did he when he sent his disciples back and and they began to talk to jesus one thing jesus didn't just give him a clear answer to say yes um i'm here go tell him yes he didn't do it that way but he says i want you to just hang around a little while come on and i want you to go back and tell john the things that you're seeing come on the manifestations are the gift of god i want you to go tell them how you hearing the poor got the gospel preached to them ain't you glad today that god don't just come to the high and mighty but he come to the low and the lowly come on the ones that don't even have a dollar in their pocket come on one that don't have the best suit to put on the walk in the house of god but god come to the lowest of the lowest god comes to that man on the street corner god goes to the crack house god goes to the place to where women maybe came in fame and all these things but that's what god the gospel come to be preached to them to let them know i know you're bound i know the devil has got chains on you but the word come to set you free hallelujah oh jesus come on i'm so glad that the word set me free you know in a place in my life uh growing up and and how to when the lord began calling on you come on you i was at a place in my life where things had me bound sometimes you think well all i got i can give up this night you think those are the easy things but then god is certain things that that attach themselves to your spirit and those aren't the things that are easy to let go those are the things that god by the holy ghost come on the anointing that destroys the yokes it's got to come down come on and go into a place the way man can't reach going to that place the way the preacher can't see what's going on in your life go into that place the way you don't have no control over but yet when the word when the word comes it begins to divide those things it begins to go down into that place where the strongholds are hallelujah and begins to pull down them strongholds next thing you know you begin to walk free you don't know when it happened hot happened but god did it oh jesus hallelujah he's still doing it now come on it's still things in the places that god want to reach i said open the door and let god reach that place that place that's gotta hold on you come on no demons that's latched on to your life god want to reach down in that place don't you worry about how or when come on let god in let the anointing come and destroy those yokes pull them down hallelujah because we wrestling against flesh and blood but we're wrestling against powers come on rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness in high places but god is our battle axe hallelujah he's our fortress come on he's our will in the middle of the will come on he's the fire that'll quench heavy fire oh jesus hallelujah i'm so glad that god is on our side come on when god is on your side ain't nothing the devil can do to you do you believe that this morning come on i says what weren't you out to see we know that john like it says he his disciples came and jesus began to go tell him i want you to go back and show john the things you're seeing come on and done the things you're hearing and all these things say then he'll know because we know that you know god is known by his characteristics come on he's the same yesterday today and forever god changes mass but he'll never change his nature come on what he was he will always be come on i like that and how i like how god told joshua once he says as i was with moses come on first thing he told him moses my servant is dead now come on but even though moses is dead he said as i was with moses i'm gonna be with you that same way you don't have to look at yourself as being no less come on the only thing separates you between you and the uh other like the ministers and so forth like that is the calling that god got on your life but nevertheless god is still god he's god in the ministry he's god in the loyalty come on he's god and the one the little one that don't even sing a song come on but don't you know you still got rights with god you still can go and hold an audience with god just as the preacher can just as the deacon and the trustee all those kids you still got rights to go hold the audience with god and when you call don't you know god i answer your prayer don't you go know that yo your prayer can stop god hallelujah stop him make him turn to hear someone calling come on hallelujah do you believe that this morning come on but we find that like i said john you know sit uh disciples so he told him to go back uh uh and tell them the things you seen but then jesus began to ask the people a question he says what weren't you out to see when he was concerning john talking about john he said when you when you went out what did you go out to see come on did you go out to see a reed shaking in the wind come on man that's gonna change with every wind that blower did you go out and see somebody dressed in fine raiment we know how he looked a wild man come on coming out of the wilderness and all those things he said did you go out to see a prophet come on he said but i tell you more he was more than a prophet he says that there was not a man at that time born a woman that was greater than john about come on because of the the the commission that he gave and the dedication i believe in the life that he lived before god but the thing is that's why he asked him what went you ought to see don't you know you get whatever you expect a lot of people went out but everybody expectation wasn't the same and we find that even here today you know i say this morning what did you come out to see come on whatever you came don't you know whatever your expectation level is that's what god will give you some just went out next the spectate come on some went out to criticize some didn't even go out at all because they just didn't believe but then they were had some that went out because they were looking for a word from god some went out because they heard more than just john's voice crying in the wilderness but when they heard that voice crying they felt something down in the deep calling hallelujah i don't know what it is but i know that it's something to what john is saying hallelujah and that's what it is today the word of god going out it's got to go past your intellectual thought your intellectual mind and reason but it's got to be come to a place the way the call of god when it calls out is something down in the deep that you hearing and it reaches down in that place and it begins drawing on you do you believe that this morning come on i said what went you ought to see many times you know we look back at our lives and you know each and every one of us at one point in our journey in our life god began to call in on you come on something began to drawing on you no matter where you were no matter what condition of the life that you was in something began drawing on you somebody's in that place i believe this morning where they ain't answer the call yet but something is calling on you in that place the way you call it a crossroad you don't know which way to turn to the left or to the right but what i want to say this morning is he to the call come on that call the legion come on the shepherd know where he's going he called at the sheep by name and he lead them out god will lead you out all you got to do is answer the call come on what we find out says a lot of times what we ought to see come on a lot of times in our lives we look back and you know no matter where you were in life at one point god began calling on you that voice began calling you come on and you went out come on to see what the call was about to see what the attraction was about come on but yet we we grab sometimes i i say i says what you know what what did you go out when you went out what did you go out to see come on because many people had different expectations some just wanted to be delivered from whatever life that had them bound and that they can just go on and live a normal life well if that's all you're expecting that's all you'll get come on some they want it in their heart to please god some wanted the the really live for god come on not just to be delivered from what they were but they really really wanted to give their heart to god come on and i want to say that what it is a lot of times they're coming out ain't the hard part come on a lot of times are coming out is the easy part but going in come on that's the hard part going in to the land come on not just coming out the world and being sanctified come on or justify sanctified come on but going on in to the hole is the holiest going on in to the baptism of the holy ghost going on in to that place to where your soul is satisfied many people they came out but yet their soul ain't satisfied they flesh might be satisfied this spirit might be satisfied but their soul is still thirsting still hungry hallelujah for the living god well i want to say if you still hungering there's a god to quench that hunger there's a god that quits that thirst you got to let him in hallelujah and let him have his way in your life oh jesus glory i was sharing with someone the other day i said the thing is i says it's all right to come out and be and give your light to the lord and the lord clean your life up i says but if you don't ever go on into the baptism of the holy ghost you don't ever get a personal experience with god it might be 10 years it might be 15 years it might be 20 years on down the road but sooner or later those same spirits gonna catch back up with you why because you didn't let god fill the house come on you didn't let god come in and occupy down in the rims of the soul so the demons always be out there i i began to tell them i said but one thing what god does god wants to annihilate demon powers out of your life when they were standing on the red sea i like how moses told the children of israel he said the egyptians that trouble you today come on they'll trouble you no more forever why because god was getting ready to deal with them god was getting ready to storm i want you to watch with your eyes hallelujah when i destroy them so you won't have to worry about it when you sleep at night knowing that those demons are still out there that those the enemies still out there you don't have to worry about it because i destroyed them all hallelujah and that's what god wants to do each and every one of our lives you don't have to be worried about a past desires and things why because that man is dead hallelujah you become a new creature in christ all things have become new that man that they talk about he doesn't even exist no more why because god has did a work in your life he took away that old heart and he gave you a new heart he took away that old nature and he gave you a new nature fills you with a spirit hallelujah then you and him became one how many believe that this morning hallelujah that's why we rejoice when people talk about our past and where the lord has brought us from come on sometimes the devil may anoint people to try to bring that up to try to make you feel guilty come on but when the lord has really delivered you you don't feel guilty no more when you really seen the effects of the cross you don't feel guilty no more because you know what the blood of jesus has done for you hallelujah then you can testify like paul and he says uh many of us walk that way in times past we all walk that way he said but god who was rich in mercy hallelujah in his love wherewith he loved us god didn't leave us in sin but he was rich in mercy oh jesus remind me of where i came from come on because why it's given me my joy that's where i get my peace that's where i get my shout that's where i get my song when you remind me of where i came from because it reminds me of the goodness of god it reminds me of the grace of god hallelujah oh jesus hallelujah come on you know i says one thing what happens you know i was looking at something this morning and how the prophet god was saying what the church world today what they struggle with is forgiveness come on he said they struggle with forgiveness he says that when one fall away from among them or fall he says that what they do instead of gathering together to try to win such a one back or restore the brother or the sister he says that that they run them further away by that by their what but they're talking come on instead of getting together try to win and encourage that brother he said we push him further away come on he said that's what the church world struggles with today he said but the reason why they do that is because they they haven't really experienced the power of forgiveness themselves because when they really experience the power of forgiveness come on you really realize god really showed you how down in the darkness you was and how wretched and miserable you were and how is his grace and his mercy came down and overshadowed your life come on and forgave you he said then you'll learn how to appreciate forgiveness then you won't mind extending forgiveness to somebody else you won't mind hallelujah you know it's one thing he was saying he says one thing he says it ain't a day he said it ain't an hour that go by that we don't do something wrong come on but what the problem is today is that we don't we don't want to come to the reckon and not skip down a little bit we don't we don't want to come to the reckoning that we do stuff wrong come on and that's what the church world had a problem with john's ministry john the baptist preached repentance that was his main ministry that was his main sermon was the people to repent come on but yet you had you know the we got in the church three types of believers you got the unbeliever where he just don't believe anyway but then you got to make believer come on and what does that make believer do don't you know that's a lukewarm spirit come on and where he thinking he righteous he don't see the need to repent because he thinks he's all right come on not knowing that when he in that condition the way he don't see the need for repentance and that's from the poor pit to the back door come on that he's worse than the man that's out there in the street at least that man out in the street know what kind of condition his life in he know where his head but to make believe come on the one that don't see the need for repentance yet the apostle paul he declared that he had to die daily come on he declared that when he desired to do good evil was present with him come on he declared that it was a war going on in his life hallelujah but nevertheless come on that make believer what does he do come on he don't see the need for repentance does he come on you know it's something about it's something about uh you know in this age how christ said it would people would be blind miserable wretched naked and don't know it you know to be blind is bad one thing to be miserable is one thing to be naked is one thing but to be all of those things and not know it is a whole different level come on that's a whole different level to be all those things and not know it come on but nevertheless i said god anoint our eyes with ourselves come on that we'll be able to see the condition of our lives that we won't be caught up in a false uh pretense or religion come on thinking everything is all right safe i don't have the need for repentance come on well we got to die daily do you believe that this morning come on i said that you know that's what they had problems the people of that day had problems with john ministry because of that one of his main things was to preach was a preaching repentance what we find that i says what went you ought to see it was a time you know like it says we can bring it from so many angles it was a time in your life when god calls you come on god and and what happened god i i was praying the other day and i was kind of envisioning the whole thing i said god standing at the door or standing far off making that call come on something attracted you and you went out i says but when you went out what'd you go out what'd you go out for come on i thought about so many of the patriarchs uh abraham and how and god began to call it on him come on and he went out i said abraham what'd you go out for come on he went out seeking a city whose builder and maker was god and i don't believe he was going to be able to rest until he got what he went out for come on i thought about the queen of the south and what she went out for come on because she had already heard of the supernatural things and the gifts and things that laid in king solomon her guard used them with wisdom and all but when she went out come on her expectation was right even when she got there it might have took a long journey to get there where she got she might have had to go through some things to get to where she got but when she got there god not only met her expectations but he exceeded her expectations i believe she said the half ain't been told and i believe that today what do you go out to see come on are you satisfied with just being a church member are you satisfied with just turning another leaf come on or just going in and out and living all right life come on are you satisfied or what did you go out to see hallelujah did you come out to see a god of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever did you come out to see a god of miracles a supernatural god of power one that could save to the utmost hallelujah is that what you came out to see what if that's what you came out to see don't you know god exceeds your expectations i believe that do you believe that this morning come on that says what it is come on what you went out a lot of people came out come on but the going out like i said the coming out ain't the hard part but they're going in because there's a lot of wilderness out there come on israel they didn't see the enemies that they was gonna have to battle in the wilderness they didn't see the the dryness of the land and all those things did they come on but all of that god knew it was gonna work some things out of them come on he was gonna allow them to see things in their life that they didn't know was there come on things in their heart and their spirit come on because when they were bound no doubt the bible says that they cried unto the lord no doubt they were looking for deliverance come on some say they wanted a savior but they didn't want a lord come on and we find that many people have that same attitude today they got a savior but they don't want a lord but he doesn't just want to be your savior he wants to be lord reim supreme ruler over your life come on he wants to take you not only from this place but carry you on into glory come on into the deep things of god where he can do things with you that the world don't know nothing about he can reveal things to you that the world don't know nothing about come on god can give you special blessings how many want that this morning come on what i say is the going out to coming out they didn't see all that in the wilderness and all but going in was a hard thing you know one thing i say is that that hurt that god accounted to them was not all of the the murmuring complaining necessary necessarily or the sin but the bible declared that they didn't enter in because of unbelief that's what god held them accountable for come on was the unbelief all god wanted them to do was believe them come on and that's all god wants you to do today is to believe him sometimes god many times he does especially first starting out in your journey you might see all kinds of things he just god just do all kind of exploits and overboard why we get your attention but something somewhere along the lines got to anchor you come on down in the deep to where you know you come to that place the lord if you don't do nothing else you already done enough god i believe you come on because that's what all these things are for to do what to anchor your faith anchor your faith in god so where you can take god at his word you don't you're not uh you don't need the word plus but you got the word and the word is enough for you come on but he he he accounted he held him accountable for that that that through all these things he says that they perish in the wilderness because of unbelief and we today can look at the children of israel and say how can they not believe god when god did so many mighty works come on when god brought all the plagues and when the devil angel came through and how he opened the red sea and how he gave them bread from heaven and how he gave them water from the rock and how he did all kind of mighty and wonderful things for him how can they not believe god but yet they didn't and we find that today that god has done so many great things he's doing so many great things right now among us and for us but yet people still don't believe they still won't serve god they still won't love them hallelujah oh jesus but that's between them and god come on because on a day of judgment it won't be like the prophet of god was saying god never sent one person to hell come on man sends itself to hell why because he made a way of escape and they didn't want it he came from heaven died shed his blood that you don't have to be in the condition you in you don't have to walk in darkness but men love darkness rather than light why because their deeds are evil they need a nature change hallelujah and that's what happens today you need a nature change come on we were born wrong and sin did our mother conceive us we was liars from the womb cheetahs from the womb god know that he ain't gonna hold that against you but what he will hold against you was by him coming come on being rejected of men persecuted spit on wilt hallelujah went up to calvary shed his blood whosoever will let them come and yet you won't come come on the drink from that water life freely oh jesus come on what i find that i says what it is come on you say how could they not believe after all that but you fine they didn't come on but then you find that it was two come on out of all of those you no matter the obstacle now come on look that they were facing at that time looked to be way bigger than the obstacles that they came before before them looked to be like way more of a challenge but it was something that the bible says joshua and caleb had another spirit come on they didn't have the same spirit as everybody else they had another spirit come on because the other ones they were saying we in our own eyes look like grasshoppers come on but the spirit that joshua and caleb had in them come on god had already done enough he they already know what god who god was they already know that god was going to keep his word come on it didn't matter what was in the land come on but they knew that god was able we might be fewer number but they knew that god was able because their faith was anchored come on not just saying what moses said or any of those things but their faith somewhere along the line got anchored in god god anchored in the word of god and that's what we do today preaching the gospel what do we try to do get your faith anchored not in a man come on not in the church but get your faith anchored in guard come on that at the church fade away come on no matter who comes or who goes come on you can still be right there with god why because that's where your faith is anchored in there's nothing in between you and god but you've gotten to that place the way you went behind the veil come on the hole is a holist where everything is shut off you ain't hearing the noise of the world you ain't hearing the struggles and the battles of the world but you back there in that chicano glory where god is feeding you hallelujah it might be storming outside but in that chicano right there in the hole as a whole is in that place though it's storming outside though it's cold outside you in there with sunshine every day come on the light of the holy ghost is warming you and it's keeping you why because there is no death in that place there's only life and that's the place that we want to go to today this body might age but let me get to that place today where there's only life hallelujah that the skin worms though they might eat this flesh yet in my flesh i'll see god because i know hallelujah that my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand on the earth and when he called my name i want to answer come on i will answer how many believe that this morning come on we don't doubt that but we believe that because that's a promise that god gave us how many thank the lord this morning jesus i said come on going out coming out what did you come out what'd you go out to see come on what went to you out to see come on i says you know you get your expectation what is your expectation come on what do you expect come on when you come in the house of god what do you expect because you're going to get whatever you expect if you're expecting something from god god got something to give you come on you just came just to socialize and that's all you'll get if you come come on with your heart burn and desire come on might not even been for yourself but for lost souls for a family member for a friend come on i believe that if y'all if you get to the right place come on channel is right i believe god uh turn his ear to your prayer come on your hearts cry i believe that do you believe that this morning come on that god can do exceedingly above all we can ask a thing that ain't just a saying but that's reality i believe that come on so you say what did you go out to see come on i know that like i said when the lord saved you you might start off running then you come to that place of wilderness those trials things just to try you come on but you don't stop there what do you do you get back up and you keep on going god don't count the man that fall but god count them for not getting back up come on you fall but you get back up and you keep on come on we got a race to run i want to encourage y'all this morning let's get up and fight we got a race to run don't let the devil hold things over your life repent come on that's that's the way to get your audience back with god repent come on get down on your knees i ain't talking about with a smile on your face come on sometimes you got you got to be godly sorry something got to grip your heart come on god hear that man do you believe that this morning come on god is so good amen i said what went you ought to see come on what went you ought to see god called you and some god is still calling come on when you go out what are you going out to see come on because the word holds true everything that god said is true all his promises are yeah and not me come on i said so when you go out what are you going out to see come on god want to open your eyes you know it can be a lot of people in the same room but everybody ain't seeing the same thing everybody ain't feeling the same thing come on so why because some have an intern some minds have been captivated and just going all off into all these other things but then you got some that they came to hear a word i thought about that song this morning i don't know what you come to do come on but i come to give god praise i come to hear god's word a lot of times i know everybody pick at me because i say come on so much but i said a lot of times i say that because i be preaching to myself a lot of times say something i said come on because it's it's stirring to me too come on the ministry the preacher ain't just preaching to the congregation but he preaching it to himself something down to his souls amen in the word do y'all believe that this morning is the man up here just preaching out to y'all and he think that that he's uh he's doesn't need repentance himself then what happens he in bad shape too come on but what it is the word come to help us all that's what the word come to do they come to help us i say you got to let god help you come on god don't want to hurt you but god want to help you he knows your struggles and your battles he knows the the things you face with the peer pressures and all those things god knows all of that come on and don't you know he went through those things too come on he was tested and tried come on he went through all those things so not only does he telling you oh you can make it but he knows what you're going through come on he's a god that can be touched by the feeling of our affirmatives he knows what we're faced with he knows what what is life more so than each and every one of us come on to be rejected of all you know the creator of the world but when they came and he came to his own his own didn't even know him he didn't even receive him god know what that's like come on so when you come to god it ain't that he don't know what that's like he knows what that's like come on but he knows what it's like to overcome those things and he says that you're overcome too why because he's overcome the world and that's how you overcome by the through the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony i say let's overcome this morning let us bow our heads in the word of prayer jesus i said what went you ought to see god is calling some have already come out but maybe you come out and you ain't went in come on well god wants to carry you in back there in that place that's the only place where the world won't affect you and the things the trials the seasons you won't be affected by them back there in that place coming out just ain't good enough you got to go in god wants to fill you with a spirit he wants to do something down in your soul the way it don't matter what day of the
