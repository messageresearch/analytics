[18:08] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[18:13] we want to look at the Book of Luke by
[18:15] God's grace
[18:17] Luke 4.
[18:21] and we'll begin at the
[18:24] 14th verse
[18:32] Luke 4 and 14.
[18:43] and it reads and Jesus returned in the
[18:46] power of the spirit into Galilee and
[18:49] there went out a Fame of him through all
[18:53] of the region round about and he taught
[18:55] in their synagogues being glorified of
[18:58] all and he came to Nazareth where he had
[19:00] been brought up
[19:02] and his cut as his custom he went to the
[19:05] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[19:08] up for to read and there was delivered
[19:10] unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs
[19:13] and when he had opened the book he found
[19:16] a place wherein where it is written the
[19:19] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[19:22] because he hath anointed me to preach
[19:24] the gospel to the poor he have sent me
[19:27] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[19:29] Deliverance to the captives and
[19:31] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[19:34] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[19:36] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[19:38] and he closed the book and he gave it
[19:40] again to the minister and sat down in
[19:44] the eyes of all them that were in the
[19:46] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[19:48] began to say unto them this day is the
[19:52] scripture fulfilled in your ears and all
[19:55] bear witness and all bear him witness
[19:57] and he wondered and wondered the
[20:00] gracious Words which proceeded out of
[20:03] his mouth and they said it's not this
[20:05] Joseph's son and he said unto them you
[20:07] will surely say unto me this proverb
[20:09] position to heal thyself whatsoever We
[20:11] Have Heard done in Capernaum do also
[20:13] here in that country and he said unto
[20:15] him and he said verily I say unto you no
[20:18] Prophet that's except in his own country
[20:20] but I tell you the truth many widows
[20:22] were in Israel in the days of Elias
[20:25] wherein the heavens was shut up three
[20:27] years and six months when Great Famine
[20:29] was throughout all the land but none of
[20:31] them was Elias sent save unto serp to a
[20:35] city in of Asylum unto a woman that was
[20:38] a widow and many lepers were in Israel
[20:40] at the time of Elijah's the prophet and
[20:43] none of them was cleansed saving Naaman
[20:45] the Syrian and all the synagogue when
[20:48] they heard these things were filled with
[20:49] wrath and Rose up and thrust him out of
[20:53] the city and led him away to the bow to
[20:55] the brow of the Hill wherein their city
[20:57] was built that they might cast him down
[21:00] headlong but he passing through the
[21:03] midst of them with his way may God is a
[21:06] blessed reading of this word
[21:08] maybe see it tonight by God's grace just
[21:12] for a moment I want to minister on a
[21:14] type on a topic and I entitled it the
[21:17] times are changing amen
[21:20] the times are changing you know just
[21:23] just looking here and things been on my
[21:26] heart you know I was saying that you
[21:28] know we're living in some unstable times
[21:31] we're living in a time where where
[21:33] everyone seems to be searching for
[21:35] stability but they can't find none
[21:37] nowhere the whole world like we say is
[21:39] is falling or already falling apart and
[21:43] that's why they in the point now where
[21:44] they say is we just got to open
[21:46] everything back up just let everything
[21:48] go back to being as it was no matter
[21:50] what the outcome is we're going to have
[21:52] to try to force our way back to the way
[21:55] things used to be
[21:57] but as I say tonight the times are
[21:59] changing the world I believe that as we
[22:03] saw it before it'll never be the same
[22:05] we'll never be at a force our way back
[22:07] into the the old uh away or the way
[22:11] things were for one it's because of fear
[22:14] it has gripped the people's hearts in
[22:15] such a way that the people themselves
[22:18] they don't know what to do you know some
[22:21] have just uh uh well we would say take a
[22:23] fanatical Approach at it and then some
[22:25] are just grip so much in fear it's just
[22:28] no uh stability everywhere everybody's
[22:31] looking for answers everybody's looking
[22:33] for a a a a a resolution or some resolve
[22:38] to the present-day crisis they're
[22:40] looking for the antidote they're looking
[22:41] for a way to get the economy back on
[22:44] track they're looking for something
[22:46] that's going to just uh when everything
[22:48] is in a panic they're looking for
[22:50] something to come and stabilize us again
[22:52] but I want to say you know it just says
[22:56] in the Bible it says that go to heaven
[22:58] and earth uh will pass away he said that
[23:01] my word won't pass away I believe that
[23:04] he says that if you to the man in Psalms
[23:07] 1 that would keep his word he said that
[23:09] man would be like a tree planted by the
[23:11] rivers of Living Waters that man he
[23:14] won't be able to be moved I come to the
[23:16] point you know in my life looking at you
[23:20] know things and looking at the
[23:21] uncertainty other times and the
[23:23] unstability of that we're seeing today
[23:25] and I says you know the only stability
[23:28] the only thing that we're going to find
[23:30] that's going to keep us together in
[23:32] these uncertain times is going to be
[23:34] Christ and Christ himself not just some
[23:37] form of religion not just some church
[23:40] but it's going to have to be a Christ
[23:42] and him alone it's times past that we
[23:46] just see the word and just have good
[23:48] sermons or just read and and just have
[23:51] what they would say just a letter
[23:52] because the Bible says that the letter
[23:54] will kill you but the spirit will give
[23:55] you life it cometh it's a time and the
[23:58] time I believe is now where we should
[24:01] see the scriptures uh coming alive we
[24:04] should see the the spirit of God uh
[24:07] through the Holy Ghost uh taking the
[24:09] word and quickening it and that way we
[24:11] can actually draw the benefits from it
[24:14] because we're living in a time where we
[24:16] need the benefits from the word of God
[24:18] we need I believe that the Bible says
[24:20] when Jesus here was coming back out of
[24:22] the Wilderness that's what the Prelude
[24:24] was he was coming back out of the
[24:25] Wilderness the Bible says he was filled
[24:27] with the spirit and the power of God it
[24:30] wasn't that he was just uh uh just ready
[24:33] just to go to church uh just to have
[24:35] start back having church again and
[24:37] saying like that but it was something
[24:39] about it the church world as they noted
[24:41] of that day was about to change it was
[24:44] no longer just reading the Scrolls and
[24:46] all those things now the Living Word was
[24:48] among them but they wasn't ready for and
[24:51] that's what I said tonight the times are
[24:53] changing come on you know and and we we
[24:56] have the world has a struggle with with
[24:59] or they would call it change sometimes
[25:02] because they might have found themselves
[25:04] comfortable just where they were at
[25:06] comfortable in the condition they were
[25:08] in comfortable in going in and coming
[25:10] out but God does some things a lot of
[25:12] times as we say the sturdiness they get
[25:14] you out of that comfort zone because he
[25:16] wants to let you know that hey that
[25:19] comfort zone that you're in that's not a
[25:21] real security things are about to change
[25:23] and if you don't change with the times
[25:25] then what's going to happen you're going
[25:27] to spiritually die not only will you
[25:29] spiritually dive but in this time you
[25:31] might physically die why because not
[25:33] understanding what God is doing in this
[25:36] day that's what they're like we always
[25:38] uh uh uh that's what I was saying on the
[25:40] other week uh last week it was I said
[25:43] you know Jesus said that the word of God
[25:46] is a sea come on and I say as we being
[25:49] Ministers of the Gospel we always desire
[25:52] that when we minister in the word we
[25:53] know and then succeed but we know it
[25:56] takes something to bring that seed to
[25:58] life so as we speak in the word we
[26:01] always desire that that seed would fall
[26:03] on good ground would fall on ground that
[26:06] it can bring forth uh the potential
[26:09] that's lying in that seed it's a it's
[26:12] sometimes uh discourage a man that he
[26:15] knows that the word can help you or can
[26:17] help an individual but they won't take
[26:19] the word they won't eat the word they
[26:21] won't live in the word so it's a
[26:23] discouragement sometimes he stay on his
[26:25] knee crying so he said Lord I know that
[26:28] you your word can help I know that God
[26:31] if people would quit putting their trust
[26:33] in men putting their trust in everything
[26:35] else God and begin to looking up to you
[26:37] God that you can do something special
[26:39] for him you can get them away from all
[26:42] those sleepless nights you can know God
[26:44] brings stability to their life of fear
[26:46] and and shame God but Lord as we
[26:49] minister in the word you you want the
[26:51] seed to go out and bring forth you want
[26:54] it you want the ground uh to be right
[26:57] you God I believe loves to see hearts
[27:01] that's broken and that's why a lot of
[27:02] times what he does he points out our era
[27:06] he points out the faults and the things
[27:08] in our life to do what to break up the
[27:10] ground not only to break up the ground
[27:12] and not give you something but he breaks
[27:14] that ground up because he wants to plant
[27:16] a seed in there he wants to plant
[27:18] something in your heart that when it
[27:20] begins to grow then it begins to bring
[27:23] forth and that seed that type of life or
[27:25] that God plants in there then that's the
[27:28] genuine life the life of of God himself
[27:30] I believe which comes through the
[27:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[27:34] what it is we all desire that but we're
[27:36] talking about tonight the times are
[27:38] changing come on there was always things
[27:41] that happened in the world that have
[27:44] such impacts on the world that the world
[27:47] of the earth will never be the same
[27:49] again afterwards you know and we can
[27:52] look at many examples we look at the the
[27:54] era when when the cars come about then
[27:57] you know the planes come about but one
[27:59] of the one of the things I always like
[28:02] to look at was how you know the atomic
[28:05] weapons when they when they were
[28:07] beginning to be uh created and all these
[28:10] things it was a one of the great
[28:12] scientists of that day Robert
[28:14] Oppenheimer tonight you know that they
[28:17] detonated the first atomic bomb him in a
[28:20] uh a couple of other Lily horn and a
[28:22] couple other scientists you know they
[28:24] said within themselves you know they
[28:26] begin to quote this quote from a poet
[28:29] and they said have become deaf they'll
[28:31] destroy your worlds and I remember Lenny
[28:33] hornan saying that that night the
[28:35] scientists knew that the world that we
[28:37] knew it as before would never be the
[28:39] same why because now that they've just
[28:42] tapped into a a space in time to where
[28:45] they've been to where they've created
[28:47] something that could potentially destroy
[28:49] man off the face of the Earth and what
[28:52] it was they realized that the times that
[28:55] they used to live in before that night
[28:57] it wouldn't be the same after that day
[28:59] they knew that the world was changing
[29:01] but they said the majority of the world
[29:04] didn't know that it was changing they
[29:06] said that even America itself in the
[29:08] government they didn't realize just just
[29:11] how much the world had changed overnight
[29:13] but they understood it because it was
[29:17] something that gripped them and that's
[29:19] what it is we find today you know I
[29:23] don't believe that the whole world as a
[29:26] whole understand what's taking place
[29:29] only a few I believe the Bible says that
[29:33] straight is a gate narrowers away but
[29:35] only a few there'll be that find it I
[29:37] believe when Jesus walked the the Earth
[29:40] in his time you know even though things
[29:43] were changing even though the world
[29:45] would never be the same everybody didn't
[29:48] know and only a few knew it only a few
[29:51] knew what was taking place
[29:53] and to not know what's taking place in
[29:56] that time or past you and you'll be
[29:58] unaware you'll be living in a day that
[30:01] that's beyond the time that you're
[30:03] living in you won't understand what God
[30:05] is doing so we find that and I said just
[30:07] like they they says that the world in
[30:10] itself didn't understand just the change
[30:12] I was going through and I say it's God
[30:14] that's what it is I believe that
[30:17] you look at here you know in the
[30:19] scriptures how all the time when when
[30:22] the angel in looking Book of Revelation
[30:24] when he when the angel had an
[30:25] announcement to make he would make us
[30:27] announcement but even though that
[30:29] announcement will go out the whole world
[30:31] might heard it but in that announcement
[30:33] he would say he that happened here let
[30:35] him hear what the spirit is saying unto
[30:38] the churches come on because even though
[30:40] things would be transferring and taking
[30:42] place before the people only those that
[30:45] had an ear would be able to hear it only
[30:47] those that had their eyes anointed what
[30:50] I say I would be able to see it and how
[30:52] does that come about you can't
[30:54] intellectually uh uh see these things
[30:57] you can't uh through your own ability
[31:00] hear these things but it takes uh Christ
[31:03] himself it takes you being sold out to
[31:06] God allowing his Spirit to come and fill
[31:08] you up come on change you from the way
[31:11] that you are shake you away from your
[31:13] condition or your life becoming a new
[31:16] creature in Christ that that's what uh
[31:18] uh uh made the difference that's why
[31:21] Jesus was told the disciples many times
[31:23] you don't understand what I'm saying
[31:25] right now he says but when the comforter
[31:27] come when the Holy Ghost come in my name
[31:29] he said then you'll understand these
[31:31] things I remember he told our Nicodemus
[31:33] he said except the man be born again he
[31:37] can't even see the kingdom of God come
[31:39] on we know that he he can't understand
[31:41] it he don't even know what it's all
[31:43] about come on Nicodemus you a Pharisee
[31:46] you're a preacher you one that know the
[31:48] the book intellectually in and out but
[31:50] yet you still have no understanding of
[31:53] what's taking place
[31:55] you can't see the kingdom of God you
[31:57] don't understand it without the Holy
[31:59] Ghost
[32:00] but what we find today that people
[32:03] downplay the Holy Ghost so much they
[32:06] downplayed the literal life of Jesus
[32:09] Christ coming in you they taking it and
[32:11] made it a shout they taken it and made
[32:14] it a dance so just speaking in tongues
[32:16] but there's no life-changing experience
[32:18] there's no power behind it there's
[32:21] nothing quickening down on the inside
[32:23] that's gonna bring the word to life
[32:26] but that's what God is getting us to
[32:27] that's what we need today somebody
[32:30] that's got a home to the spirit of God
[32:33] that when they read the word they can
[32:35] see where they are they can hear what
[32:36] the spirit is saying to them Hallelujah
[32:39] and I find that I said God that's what
[32:42] it is he says he that hath an ear let
[32:44] him hear
[32:45] what the spirit is saying it takes the
[32:48] Holy Ghost to hear what the spirit is
[32:50] saying it takes the Holy Ghost to see
[32:52] that the times are changing what's
[32:54] taking place without that you'll be left
[32:56] out without that you'll be struggling
[32:58] you'll get deceived when it's passed out
[33:01] but you'll be like those by the wayside
[33:03] or those that's on the Stony ground of
[33:06] those that's planted among thorns and
[33:08] thistles never be able to bring forth
[33:10] the The Life of Christ never be able to
[33:13] to to uh bring forth the full
[33:16] manifestation that you know I said one
[33:18] thing about God God I say he wants to
[33:21] get all all out of you that he can come
[33:25] on he wants to get all of you all that
[33:27] he can I believe you know when you when
[33:30] a man comes to God he ought to make it
[33:32] up in his mind that Lord whatever it
[33:34] takes God I want to give you all of me
[33:36] God whatever I got to give up Lord I'm
[33:39] ready to give up Lord whatever I got to
[33:41] sacrifice Here I Am Lord not my will but
[33:44] let thy will be done in my life God I'm
[33:47] giving you all of me and then when it
[33:49] happens the Holy Ghost comes down and
[33:51] he's a teacher he begins to teach you
[33:53] all things he begins to show you how to
[33:55] walk like Christ how to act like Christ
[33:57] how to live like Christ why because it's
[34:00] him in you that is taking over and I
[34:03] believe that hallelujah what we need now
[34:06] more than anything is Christ uh to take
[34:09] over our lives they engulf Us in such a
[34:12] way so we become dead and all that all
[34:15] that we live is only geared towards him
[34:18] I believe that with all of my heart but
[34:21] we find that like we say is now the the
[34:23] times are changing like it says you know
[34:25] we look at it and I know the prophet of
[34:27] God is talking about you know he call it
[34:30] the Junctions of time times are changing
[34:33] come on times it has been that way ever
[34:36] since the world began you know ever
[34:39] since time began things would happen in
[34:41] the earth and the world just says they
[34:43] know that it would never be the same
[34:45] ever again
[34:46] it would be a turning point and it
[34:49] always was a struggle for those that was
[34:52] caught in that Turning Point
[34:54] that was in right in the middle of it
[34:56] because like it says only a few would be
[34:59] able to understand what was taking place
[35:01] and they would make it through that
[35:03] Junction and then you would have those
[35:05] that would die in the in the middle of
[35:07] the junction but you have those that
[35:09] they just wouldn't receive it I think
[35:11] about you know I says that even though
[35:14] when these great things are happening in
[35:17] the earth we can look all through the
[35:18] scriptures if the Bible says in Amos uh
[35:21] three and seven surely the Lord God
[35:23] would do nothing but reveal its secrets
[35:26] to his servant of prophets before God
[35:28] bring judgment he always gives you a
[35:31] space of Mercy a space or a time where
[35:34] he allows the people to come to
[35:36] repentance and I said that even though
[35:39] God generally gives the people a space
[35:42] to repent a lot of times the people
[35:44] still won't repent
[35:46] they still want to live in their ways
[35:48] still want a little sinful lives
[35:51] still want to carry on just as things
[35:54] were come on but God brings us to a
[35:57] stopping point sometimes and says I want
[35:59] you to hold on for a while consider your
[36:02] ways
[36:03] come on repent get back to me that's
[36:07] what God does sometimes we find that
[36:10] here
[36:11] that we say as the times are changing we
[36:14] find that Noah you know in his day the
[36:17] times were changing come on the Bible
[36:19] says that the men's heart was on evil
[36:22] and evil continually
[36:23] the Bible says that the imagination on
[36:26] every man's heart was on evil
[36:27] continually they were they were marrying
[36:30] and drinking and giving and married all
[36:32] these things and they were going doing
[36:34] all these things and God got tired of it
[36:37] one day
[36:38] and the times were about to change
[36:41] God but not only like I said where the
[36:43] times were changing God gave them a
[36:46] space there I believe that God God gave
[36:48] them a way of Escape
[36:49] come on no doubt when God he the Bible
[36:53] says that Noah found Grace in Eyes Of
[36:56] God come on and that's what it's about
[36:58] even though the times are getting ready
[37:00] to change God is still going to give
[37:02] somebody some Grace
[37:04] Hallelujah I thank God even in the hour
[37:07] that we living in come on don't don't
[37:09] shun the grace of God don't shun your
[37:12] opportunity your space and time to get
[37:14] your soul right your space and time that
[37:17] God has given you to repent you'll look
[37:19] back on that day one day and wish you
[37:21] had a took seize to that opportunity
[37:23] you'll look back one day and wish you
[37:26] would have heeded the call
[37:27] Hallelujah I believe that but we find
[37:31] that like I said as in that day Noah you
[37:34] know him building the art God told him
[37:36] it's going to rain here I'm building the
[37:37] ark and I and I says you know even in
[37:40] that you know no doubt people witness
[37:44] Noah building the ark no doubt they
[37:47] witnessed something great happening in
[37:49] their day
[37:50] but you know they were too caught up
[37:54] with their with their drinking
[37:56] they were too caught up with the lives
[37:58] they were living they were too caught up
[38:00] with the imagination and thoughts and
[38:02] all these things are going out just
[38:03] living the next day that they didn't
[38:05] want to uh uh really receive it that
[38:09] times was about to change
[38:11] the world as they knew it will never be
[38:14] the same no more the flood was coming
[38:16] and if you didn't get in the heart you
[38:19] was going to die in your sins
[38:21] and I said that you know when Noah he he
[38:24] him and his family they got on in the
[38:26] ark no doubt you know the people they
[38:29] witnessed it some say Noah preached to
[38:32] him but no doubt they witnessed it no
[38:35] doubt they they they saw that and that
[38:37] sign that God gave them was going to be
[38:40] a judgment to them in the end but they
[38:42] find that like I said they they were so
[38:44] caught up to what they were doing
[38:46] they didn't understand that after
[38:48] tomorrow we'll say it like that
[38:51] the world will never be the same
[38:53] when the rain began to fall
[38:55] all that we known of it was the past it
[38:58] was gonna never be the same ever again
[39:00] it was a turning point now God got tired
[39:03] of it and he said now it's time to make
[39:05] some changes you know many people they
[39:08] don't look at God's judgment they said
[39:10] God wouldn't come on God get tired of
[39:12] sin sometimes God get tired of the way
[39:15] the church world is today God get tired
[39:18] of people coming in and out and won't
[39:21] repent God get tired of people not
[39:24] trusting him he gets tired of people not
[39:27] calling on his name and sometimes he
[39:29] brings a change
[39:31] sometimes God brings a a turning point
[39:34] in our lives but we find that I said
[39:37] that the times are changing but we know
[39:40] that even though the times were changing
[39:42] before judgment came God brought Mercy
[39:47] we look at in the days of in the days of
[39:50] Abraham the times were about to change
[39:52] come on when lot knows I mean down in
[39:55] Sodom and Gomorrah and the filth and the
[39:58] things that were going on in the world
[39:59] come on but after that it was after that
[40:02] day after a certain time the world that
[40:05] they know it wasn't going to be the same
[40:06] no more but it was going to always be in
[40:09] a remembrance of man that you had a
[40:11] world so wicked I mean a city's so
[40:13] wicked in the earth that God himself
[40:15] came down to destroy
[40:18] could that happen again today
[40:20] could it will we come to a time that not
[40:22] just a city but we can be living in a
[40:24] world
[40:25] so insane
[40:26] you look at the news a lot of times it
[40:29] breaks your heart the seed to the extent
[40:33] people would go
[40:35] to the morals of of the world itself how
[40:38] low they've gotten
[40:40] some of the old-timers might look and
[40:43] say they never thought they'd see a
[40:44] world where the the people would be so
[40:47] insane but that they've witnessed that
[40:50] the times have changed you say is it
[40:52] drugs is it alcohol I say it's demon
[40:55] powers I said Spirits lurking in the
[40:58] Earth today that sometimes we don't know
[41:01] nothing about that's why it takes the
[41:03] spirit of God Sheltering us and keeping
[41:06] us away from all danger hurting harm I
[41:09] pray to myself I said Lord I don't have
[41:11] to understand just the severity
[41:13] sometimes of what's going on out there
[41:15] but keep my eyes on you Lord I believe
[41:18] when when Jesus was meeting Peter on the
[41:20] water uh uh um it wasn't about the winds
[41:24] and the waves only thing he had to do
[41:26] was keep his eyes on Jesus because when
[41:28] he got to seeing the severity of the
[41:30] storm then his heart began to fail for
[41:32] fear and that's what it is we're not
[41:34] looking at the severity of the storm I
[41:36] don't know about you my brother or
[41:38] sister but I'm looking to the Hills from
[41:39] which cometh my help I'm looking for
[41:41] Christ himself to return again and take
[41:44] us home I believe that but we find today
[41:48] what's happening like we say the times
[41:50] are changing I thought about that I says
[41:53] that you know the Angels came down and
[41:56] you know that's something about it at
[41:58] each Junction of time when major things
[42:00] are happening in the earth don't you
[42:01] know Angels start appearing
[42:03] God himself will come down he's already
[42:07] here you say he'll come down he's
[42:08] already here but Supernatural things
[42:10] will take place as well as we say when
[42:12] the when the enemy come in like a flood
[42:14] the spirit of the Lord will lift up a
[42:16] standard against him I thank God that
[42:18] his Spirit still will combat the devil I
[42:21] thank God that his spirit is still
[42:22] fighting for us his spirit is still
[42:24] raising us up above all our enemies I
[42:27] had a dream the other day and things
[42:28] were taking place and and in the dream
[42:31] the Lord was showing me he says every
[42:33] time man thinks he outsmart me or every
[42:35] time man think he got your demon the
[42:37] powers look like they going over
[42:38] floodger he said I'm gonna raise you up
[42:40] here I'ma keep raising you up just above
[42:42] all of that don't you worry about it you
[42:44] just keep your eyes on me and I was so
[42:47] stirred when I woke up out of the dream
[42:49] I said Lord that's what it is why don't
[42:51] we fret why are we in fear knowing that
[42:53] God is going to take care of us Romans
[42:55] we keep our hands in the Master's hands
[42:57] as long as we walk with him and allow
[42:59] him to have his way in our lives I ain't
[43:01] worried about the storms
[43:04] what it is we gonna ride On Eagle's
[43:07] Wings that anointing that God has sent
[43:10] in this hour is going to take us up out
[43:12] of our troubles out of all our trials
[43:14] God said he wouldn't let him overtake
[43:16] you come on but we find
[43:18] I said times are changing we look at
[43:21] that we look at you know there's so many
[43:24] examples that we can go through in the
[43:26] scriptures but time we know that they
[43:28] would fail us you know to even uh try to
[43:31] touch the surface of the things that the
[43:33] Lord had put on our hearts but I said
[43:35] times was changing
[43:37] come on things are taking place in the
[43:40] earth
[43:40] and you know what it is like like me and
[43:43] uh brother Simmons was talking before
[43:45] service the people what it is they
[43:49] they show us they trying to force the
[43:50] economy back up Force they say come on
[43:52] we got to have church don't matter if
[43:54] another outbreak come we can't afford
[43:56] what it is they gonna try to they want
[43:58] to force their way back into the hot
[43:59] Wars my wife was telling me about the
[44:02] school system and all of the the uh
[44:05] things the guidelines and stuff now that
[44:07] they want for the children for the next
[44:08] school year it'll be almost impossible
[44:10] to keep those guidelines the way they'll
[44:13] try to keep the things from breaking out
[44:14] you know they were saying that over in
[44:16] France they tried to start the school
[44:17] system back up but they had an outbreak
[44:20] in the schools but what it is the world
[44:22] is is what uh they're living in fear
[44:25] you know they're living in fear they
[44:28] don't know what to do so what they want
[44:30] to do is just sometimes you can be like
[44:32] playing a game or watching a video or
[44:34] something they want to hit the reset
[44:36] button they want to start all over they
[44:38] want to just start oh come on let's
[44:39] start it all over but it ain't no reset
[44:41] button
[44:42] there ain't no starting all over
[44:45] I I believe that come on but we find
[44:48] that now like we said times is changing
[44:50] and if times are changing God what are
[44:53] you doing come on it'll be who's each
[44:55] and every one of us to be on our knees
[44:57] asking God what God what are you doing
[44:59] not to think that we understand
[45:00] everything fully in entirety but God I
[45:03] know you're doing something and Lord
[45:05] whatever you're doing in this season
[45:06] Lord don't do it without me God what am
[45:09] I missing don't let me just uh walking
[45:12] and go and just think that oh everything
[45:14] will get back it'll soon pass but we
[45:16] know that they said soon that it says
[45:18] when safety uh is coming in sudden
[45:20] Destruction has come come on because
[45:22] Matthew uh 24. they say peace peace with
[45:27] certain instruction come on
[45:29] I think that was it but God is good amen
[45:32] Thessalonians God is good I get mixed up
[45:35] sometime we say Google messed us up
[45:39] hey sharp as we used to be amen but God
[45:42] is good
[45:44] but we find that what God is doing like
[45:46] we said times are changing come on
[45:48] things are happening where sometimes I
[45:52] remember uh Russell Simmons preaching a
[45:54] sermon uh once that where are we come on
[45:57] he said because sometimes you can be out
[45:59] on the trip you lost your road map you
[46:01] turned around the room then you you say
[46:03] hey the question come out where are we
[46:05] you might stop by the gas station and
[46:07] ask somebody hey where are where am I
[46:09] where are we come on and sometimes even
[46:11] in times we have in time we have to get
[46:14] on our knees and ask God just where are
[46:16] we lord what am I you say Lord what am I
[46:20] looking for next we know we're looking
[46:21] for the coming of the Lord but Lord
[46:23] where am I just in time you know Jesus
[46:25] here in the scriptures you know I I like
[46:29] that how John the Baptist even before
[46:31] Jesus came they asked him they said who
[46:33] are you he said I'm divorcing one crying
[46:35] in the wilderness John knew who he was
[46:38] John knew where he was in time and he
[46:40] can point to that place and says I'm I'm
[46:43] preparing the way of the Lord he's soon
[46:45] to come he says I'm not the one but I'm
[46:47] preparing away for him he says there's
[46:49] one among you right now and he was sure
[46:51] of that come on why he knew where he was
[46:53] in time he knew his hour he knew his
[46:56] date he knew what was happening around
[46:59] him come on so he can identify just
[47:01] where he was I think about you know uh
[47:05] in in that time what happened the
[47:07] scriptures were coming alive and Jesus
[47:09] here when he come into the and back from
[47:12] the Wilderness and the Bible says that
[47:14] the fame went about went abroad because
[47:16] he was Healing The Sick he was doing all
[47:18] these things these Miracles and stuff
[47:20] and when he went back to his hometown
[47:22] come on I believe that he was his
[47:25] message to them we know it was a repent
[47:27] and the Kingdom of Heaven is subtly upon
[47:30] you but we know that entirely what we
[47:32] say just paraphrasing it his message to
[47:35] them was the times are changing
[47:37] things that you knew it as before come
[47:40] on the times have changed now but the
[47:43] church World couldn't accept it
[47:45] they couldn't accept that they weren't
[47:48] going to be able to just come in the
[47:49] church and read the Scrolls and just go
[47:51] on about sacrificing but Jesus says that
[47:55] this day in your ears what you've been
[47:57] reading about what you've been looking
[47:59] for what you should have been preparing
[48:01] for now is fulfilled in your ears come
[48:04] on
[48:05] this day is what he says
[48:07] times have changed the Bible says that
[48:10] they got so mad with him that they LED
[48:14] them out they threw them out of the city
[48:15] they LED them to a place to throw them
[48:17] down on top of his head why they didn't
[48:19] want to accept that the world was
[48:22] changing that the Messiah had come they
[48:25] didn't understand it fully in its
[48:27] entirety and Jesus said and he came he
[48:30] just stopped it there and said he came
[48:31] and preached an acceptable year of the
[48:33] Lord didn't go on into judgment but the
[48:36] acceptable year the things that were
[48:38] rejected at once God was getting ready
[48:40] to receive now he was getting ready to
[48:42] accept and I'm so glad he did I'm so
[48:45] glad that when we were lost and being
[48:48] Gentile dogs without hope that God made
[48:51] a way that we can get back to him he
[48:53] made a way that we and I can be linked
[48:55] up to him I thank God how many thank God
[48:57] for that
[48:59] so good come on the times we say that
[49:03] the times
[49:04] they were changing come on
[49:06] something great had happened in the
[49:08] Earth
[49:09] and him going up to Calvary was going to
[49:12] be the climax come on let's stand after
[49:14] that because you know I like how I said
[49:16] that when Christ was crucified and his
[49:18] blood was shed says that that that
[49:20] release God come on the life that was in
[49:23] that blood was able to come back on you
[49:25] and I all before the the the Bloods of
[49:29] bulls and goats and all those things
[49:30] were just a shadow of it they could only
[49:33] you know uh cover your sins or just make
[49:35] an atonement from year to year but every
[49:37] year you had to go back but when uh to
[49:40] make an atonement but when Christ died
[49:42] and his blood was shed come on when once
[49:45] you received that life and once you
[49:47] repented of your sins were baptized in
[49:50] his name come on in the Life of Christ
[49:52] which is the Holy Ghost come back on you
[49:55] he that's a sign that God has accepted
[49:57] you come on and when God has accepted
[50:00] you it don't matter if the whole world
[50:02] has rejected you come on I believe I
[50:04] believe it was Paul that said if God be
[50:06] forced and who can be against us when
[50:08] God as they shut at you he's put his
[50:11] sample approval on your life it doesn't
[50:13] matter you might look like a uh you
[50:15] defeated in this life you might not have
[50:17] looked like the best thing in this life
[50:19] but you are more than conquerors you got
[50:21] something that's going to get you out of
[50:23] the Grave one day you got something
[50:25] that's going to help you step out of
[50:27] time and back into eternity what it is
[50:29] Christ himself come down in you I thank
[50:31] God for it I thank God what he's done
[50:34] hallelujah
[50:36] come on the times are changing Jesus
[50:40] breaking down to him come on it looks
[50:43] like you know the people should have
[50:45] been rejoiced and I think about
[50:46] something my grandmother said uh a
[50:49] couple of weeks ago I was talking right
[50:51] on the phone she got so stirred and
[50:53] she's about speaking in tongues on the
[50:55] phone and praising God and as she told
[50:58] me she said she said Jermaine she said I
[51:01] apologize she said I'm sorry she said
[51:03] but this is food for my soul that's what
[51:06] she said this is food for my soul she
[51:09] said I can't help myself she said things
[51:11] I've been serving God for all my life
[51:13] I'm seeing it manifest now and I said
[51:16] God thank you I said you know that's
[51:18] what it is you know when God is
[51:20] revealing stuff when you genuinely see
[51:23] when the spirit of God open your eyes
[51:25] and you can see what God is doing you
[51:27] can see the transition that God is
[51:29] bringing you out of Darkness Into The
[51:31] Marvelous Light something should take
[51:33] place in your soul it should be food for
[51:36] your soul it should cause you to be
[51:38] beside yourself it should stir you up
[51:40] because now you know that you're
[51:42] transitioning you're going someplace in
[51:45] God and I thank God
[51:47] but we find that he says the times are
[51:49] changing Jesus you know here like we say
[51:52] is uh uh uh um the people of that day
[51:55] they couldn't understand it and then
[51:56] they maybe had you know questions and
[51:59] all these things but Jesus I believe
[52:01] that he can discern their very thoughts
[52:03] he says I know what you're gonna say
[52:04] you're gonna say this you're gonna say
[52:06] well you did all these other wonders and
[52:09] miracles we'll do one now in front of us
[52:11] he says but then he began to bring up to
[52:13] them that's one thing about it you know
[52:15] and that's what he says what where where
[52:18] sometimes you know the word can be
[52:21] misrepresented where we can talk about
[52:24] change and we can talk about the time is
[52:27] changing that that's not saying that
[52:29] that the time is changing away from the
[52:32] Holiness the time is changing away from
[52:35] the Holy Ghost that's still the message
[52:37] or the living right come on or
[52:39] conducting yourself as a Christian
[52:41] should conduct yourself or get loose
[52:43] because God no God ain't changing like
[52:46] that he said I'm the Lord to not change
[52:47] not well that which has been is now come
[52:51] on we know that the times don't when we
[52:54] say times are changing God is still his
[52:56] word so even though Jesus came to break
[52:59] that down to them he took them back to
[53:01] the scriptures he still never never got
[53:04] away from the word it was still the word
[53:06] come on it was still right but he came
[53:09] to show them that what you saw in Shadow
[53:11] now I am the manifestational I'm I'm the
[53:14] reality of the shadow that you saw come
[53:17] on and that's what it is Christ even
[53:19] today he's not I mean when we come to
[53:22] Minnesota the word can be misrepresented
[53:24] come on God ain't just they ain't just
[53:27] letting this word down like that come on
[53:29] it's still right God is still holy God
[53:32] is still requiring the same thing but
[53:35] what it is he's elevating you and I in
[53:38] the spirit to a place the way we can
[53:40] actually see the Fulfillment of the word
[53:42] in our day see what God is doing come on
[53:46] and understand you know where you are
[53:48] come on you're like like you said that
[53:50] tree planted by the rivers of water you
[53:53] can't be moved uh uh you you know where
[53:55] you are come on I can see that Jesus
[53:58] coming and showing how he was a
[54:01] fulfillment of that what you heard come
[54:04] on
[54:05] he was the Fulfillment of that
[54:08] times were changing I said when the
[54:10] times have changed when the times was
[54:12] changing a lot of times you know those
[54:15] that were part of it and I said it they
[54:18] they had a The Junction they had
[54:20] struggles sometimes in in the midst of
[54:23] it
[54:25] they had struggles
[54:27] in the midst of them but I said it's
[54:29] what it is you know one day like we said
[54:32] as we know it even as time it won't be
[54:35] time no longer but we'll be back into
[54:37] eternity and I believe that that's what
[54:39] we all looking and longing for it was
[54:42] just gripping my heart so to just see
[54:44] how every Everybody Wants to Gear Up
[54:47] Everybody Wants things to go back to
[54:49] normal come on and no doubt we we desire
[54:52] to be able to come in the house of God
[54:54] and worship freely and things with even
[54:56] within ourselves but we have to say Lord
[54:59] whatever you're doing God don't let me
[55:02] be uh Mr move or what you're doing today
[55:05] well God I want to be a part of that
[55:07] move Lord God whatever you're doing the
[55:10] times are changing amen
[55:25] praise God times are changing amen I
[55:28] thought about the Reformation amen I
[55:31] thought about Lutheran
[55:33] zingly and
[55:35] and then I thought about
[55:37] the different ones so God that was back
[55:40] there John Hudson those who come in
[55:43] beforehand and
[55:45] preparing the way
[55:48] the Catholic church had the people in
[55:50] such a dark state
[55:53] and then Luther had came forth
[55:56] preaching to just shall live by faith it
[55:59] was a time of change
[56:01] he meant the Reformation had come to
[56:03] bring light to the word
[56:05] the people amen was no longer they had
[56:09] to sit there in darkness amen
[56:12] so by the grace of God and the time
[56:14] change
[56:16] the world Amen what's under the control
[56:19] of a system but no longer
[56:22] amen people start fighting
[56:26] deliverances come
[56:28] there must be a people on the Earth amen
[56:30] that's gonna amen that's going to be
[56:33] ready for the challenge of the hour
[56:36] amen everything that comes to pass then
[56:39] there's got to be a people amen that's
[56:41] going to meet the challenge
[56:43] and I believe that God always had a
[56:46] witness he never left himself without a
[56:48] witness
[56:49] he had a people on the Earth
[56:51] amen that was going to take hold to the
[56:53] word and take a stand for God
[56:57] didn't we find that at the
[57:00] the
[57:01] Luther in that came before the Wesleyan
[57:05] and the different ones and
[57:08] times were changing
[57:11] I believe that
[57:13] amen after Wesley and
[57:16] the methodists and the different ones
[57:22] nazarenes and everybody
[57:24] I believe that um Seymour on Azusa
[57:27] Street
[57:28] came forth with the baptism of the Holy
[57:30] Ghost fallen on Azusa Street
[57:34] the world Amen
[57:36] had come into a cycle of time where
[57:41] we find that machines will begin the
[57:44] factories and cars and all of that began
[57:48] to come forward
[57:49] so by the grace of God times were
[57:51] changing
[57:53] things were speeding up getting faster
[57:57] now we are even in a faster pace
[58:02] the computers are getting faster faster
[58:05] everything is moving faster faster
[58:07] speeding up
[58:09] for what
[58:11] where are we going
[58:13] praise God I believe they're trying to
[58:16] break into eternity
[58:20] and I believe that
[58:22] praise God God has
[58:27] his angels to block
[58:31] man to break it into that
[58:34] dimension
[58:38] because man is trying to break into
[58:41] something
[58:42] he don't know what he's trying to do but
[58:44] he's trying to break into
[58:48] but by the grace of God I thank God that
[58:51] the people of God
[58:55] is on should be on another level
[58:59] the church is on one level
[59:02] but the Bride of Jesus Christ should
[59:04] have that double potion of spirit
[59:07] and she has another lever
[59:11] I listened to how
[59:13] amen the world comes out with their
[59:16] message and their songs and in their
[59:18] worship
[59:21] but I believe that the God has a dang
[59:23] and anointed
[59:25] singles that's going to break into that
[59:28] spirit
[59:30] and they're gonna get a revelation of
[59:33] what God is saying and they're going to
[59:35] put it to music and in the songs
[59:39] but they themselves got to break into
[59:42] amen the place where God is
[59:46] to understand what God is doing
[59:50] praise God the Holy Ghost amen is
[59:53] available
[59:55] to give us a place
[59:57] that we can go in and amen need of the
[1:00:01] Hidden matter
[1:00:04] praise God go back amen and bring it
[1:00:08] back to the people because we entered
[1:00:11] into a place
[1:00:13] Lord have mercy
[1:00:16] there must be a southern noun in our
[1:00:19] spirit
[1:00:20] where we must settle down in our spirit
[1:00:23] where we can hear from God and God can
[1:00:26] speak to us and God can deal with our
[1:00:28] lives and God can do things for us amen
[1:00:34] got to get a place where we can hear
[1:00:36] what God wants done and what God wants
[1:00:39] to say
[1:00:42] I believe
[1:00:43] will depend on others but we got to say
[1:00:46] God what you want to do with me as an
[1:00:49] individual
[1:00:50] me Lord I want to be there
[1:00:57] I believe too many times
[1:00:59] amen will follows
[1:01:04] but the Bible said they are led by the
[1:01:06] spirit of God they're the sons of God
[1:01:09] I believe God is looking for people to
[1:01:12] that he can lead
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] that he can take you to the place where
[1:01:19] you need to be in him
[1:01:22] I believe we've been too long of just
[1:01:25] amen going through the motion not
[1:01:27] hearing God's voice not hearing God
[1:01:30] speak to us but I believe we'll come to
[1:01:32] a time that we got to settle down and
[1:01:34] say God speak to my heart
[1:01:38] speak to me Lord I want to know what you
[1:01:42] want done with the word
[1:01:46] it's time
[1:01:48] Lord I want to be used by you I want to
[1:01:51] please your God
[1:01:54] amen this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:01:57] pleased to dwell
[1:01:59] I believe he wants to say here ye him
[1:02:04] hear ye the bride hear ye hymn
[1:02:08] amen but we got to be his spiritual
[1:02:11] condition that God can even speak
[1:02:15] through us and use us
[1:02:18] brother and sisters time that we wake up
[1:02:21] and amen settle down and get a loan with
[1:02:24] God and say God uh speak to me Lord
[1:02:28] I need to hear your voice Lord oh
[1:02:32] if we ever needed to get along with God
[1:02:34] we need to get along with God now
[1:02:39] the world is going back
[1:02:42] even in this time of
[1:02:45] troubled time and the viruses
[1:02:49] people don't know which way to turn and
[1:02:52] said uh mentally Gathering brother
[1:02:55] Ernest I said I'm gonna tell you
[1:02:58] something
[1:02:59] the country cannot afford
[1:03:03] to shut down
[1:03:05] because if it's shut down too long we
[1:03:08] won't have in a country
[1:03:12] we've lived
[1:03:14] in a certain way and we'll condition
[1:03:17] ourselves to live in a certain way
[1:03:21] that if we shut down too long everything
[1:03:24] is going to fall apart
[1:03:28] already
[1:03:31] man can't pay the tax
[1:03:34] they're losing millions and millions and
[1:03:36] millions of dollars
[1:03:40] how can the system still run when we're
[1:03:45] losing so much money
[1:03:47] printing money that we don't have
[1:03:54] how far can we go in debt to
[1:03:59] some way it is enough
[1:04:02] it's over
[1:04:04] when will we give up and said it's over
[1:04:09] we finish
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:16] can you can you get these dreams back
[1:04:19] where you gonna get them from
[1:04:24] where are we gonna
[1:04:27] how are we going to do it
[1:04:29] how are we going to recover
[1:04:34] it's only one way we can recover is turn
[1:04:37] back to God
[1:04:40] that we'll turn to God
[1:04:44] then I know that God can help us
[1:04:48] but if we won't turn to God then there
[1:04:51] must be a Superman to come on the scene
[1:04:57] a Superman with the answer
[1:05:01] that means that the Antichrist is just
[1:05:04] run around the corner
[1:05:06] and when the Antichrist show up
[1:05:10] the people have a need in the Antichrist
[1:05:13] got the answer
[1:05:16] the people are willing to receive their
[1:05:20] Superman
[1:05:22] as the world is getting ready to receive
[1:05:25] that Superman
[1:05:30] then the super race got to come on the
[1:05:33] scene
[1:05:35] you got to earnestly seek God with all
[1:05:38] your heart
[1:05:40] I said God Amen I want to be ready
[1:05:45] because when this Spirit of antichrist
[1:05:48] come
[1:05:49] I want to be able to recognize that
[1:05:52] spirit
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:56] and I want to be ready to take a stand
[1:05:58] for the word
[1:06:01] Brothers right around the corner sisters
[1:06:04] right around the corner will you be
[1:06:06] ready to take a stand for God
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:11] not when we so laid back and relax
[1:06:15] till we get on our knees and begin to
[1:06:18] cry out to God
[1:06:22] the world's saying we
[1:06:25] we got pleasure that we gotta have we
[1:06:28] can't afford to be afraid of
[1:06:31] the virus we got to go to the beach
[1:06:35] we got to go to party
[1:06:40] the Christians are saying we can't go to
[1:06:43] church
[1:06:48] the world is saying I'm not afraid
[1:06:51] the Christians are saying I'm scared
[1:06:56] I'm saying it's got to be a balance
[1:06:58] somewhere
[1:07:00] We're Not Afraid
[1:07:03] to go to work
[1:07:06] not afraid
[1:07:08] to go to the grocery store
[1:07:13] put on our mass and go right ahead
[1:07:19] I'm not Talent folk what to do
[1:07:21] but I'ma tell you you can't do God in
[1:07:24] any kind of way and get by with it
[1:07:28] you got to pray and be loud by the
[1:07:31] spirit
[1:07:36] each individual
[1:07:40] the pastor is not your Holy Ghost
[1:07:43] the church is not your Holy Ghost
[1:07:47] coming to a time where it's you and God
[1:07:53] it's you as an individual
[1:07:56] being led by the spirit
[1:08:00] not man but for the spirit
[1:08:07] not what the pastor say but what God
[1:08:10] said to you
[1:08:12] as an individual
[1:08:17] be wise as a servant harmless as a dove
[1:08:25] God wants you to do something and
[1:08:27] for him
[1:08:33] brother and sister
[1:08:36] let's not play games and think that we
[1:08:39] can just relax sometimes let's not play
[1:08:41] games with our soul
[1:08:46] because what we do God is looking at us
[1:08:50] and he's seeing how lots and how lazy we
[1:08:54] are in the spirit instead of getting
[1:08:56] closer to God look like we're getting
[1:08:58] farther away from God
[1:09:02] brother and sister we need to get closer
[1:09:08] I noticed in our home we gather around
[1:09:11] and
[1:09:13] my wife is saying
[1:09:15] why
[1:09:17] you know the children and everybody's
[1:09:19] here and we're having these Bible
[1:09:21] studies and
[1:09:23] see she said honey you're enjoying
[1:09:26] yourself ain't it teaching
[1:09:29] you know I I I do get a little excited
[1:09:32] sometime
[1:09:33] because we're sitting around trying to
[1:09:36] get closer to God
[1:09:39] trying to get some questions I asked and
[1:09:42] sometimes I can't answer all the
[1:09:44] questions
[1:09:45] but by the grace of God it's just time
[1:09:48] for family to get together in the word
[1:09:52] take the time and get together in the
[1:09:55] word if you're not taking that time to
[1:09:57] get together in the world what are you
[1:09:59] doing with the time that God give you
[1:10:02] Amen brother sister
[1:10:08] time
[1:10:11] you know I like seeing every one of the
[1:10:14] same smiling faces
[1:10:16] that they can say I was glad when they
[1:10:18] said unto me let us go into the house of
[1:10:20] the Lord
[1:10:23] I know there are people that's thirsting
[1:10:25] and hungering to get to church
[1:10:29] to get to sing a song
[1:10:32] just to get in there lift their hands
[1:10:34] and say Lord I love you together again
[1:10:38] we're together again just praising the
[1:10:41] Lord
[1:10:43] those that came in the cause and just
[1:10:46] you know sit outside the cause and came
[1:10:50] in the yard it was hot yes it was hot
[1:10:52] but it came and it set in the cause and
[1:10:55] praise the Lord just together again
[1:10:58] I believe God recognized your effort
[1:11:02] I believe that you get your blessings
[1:11:04] when you do something to show God that's
