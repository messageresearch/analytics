might receive your word lord and it might benefit us thank you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen we want to look at the book of romans by god's grace god is good amen romans 6 and we'll begin at the 11th verse if you got it say amen i ain't got it myself romans 6 and 11 and it reads likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye shall obey it in the lust thereof neither heal yours your neither yield your ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield ye yourselves unto god as though that as as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace what shall what then shall we send because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid know ye not that to whom you yield your self your self servants to obey his servants ye are to him you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but god be think that we were that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when ye were the servants of sin you were you were free from righteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now shamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness in the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord may god bless to the reading of his word tonight by god's grace uh for a moment i just want to talk to you and i i entitled it i'm still working with with our two masters but the sub topic will be the servant to sin amen so we still kind of talking about two masters but you know sub-topic like we said is to be servants uh to sin you know and like you know just reading here in the scriptures is just listen to what paul is saying about how you yield yourselves he was saying you know giving it out as as though you have a choice and that's what he says to whom you yield yourselves that's who you're going to become the servants of so as we know that jesus says that no man can serve two masters so you can't you can't yield yourself to god and the devil at the same time so he says to whom you yield yourself to or what you decide to yield yourself to you're going to become a servant of it and a lot of times we thinking that or you know sometimes we can feel as though i'm in control i know what i'm doing i got control of my life but that's not that's not the case you end up you you either you're going to be like paul says i'm a prisoner of the christ or you're going to be a prisoner to the devil one or the other it's not that you're in control it's only it's only two powers in this earth and we know that they're battling for control and those two powers that's battling for control is either god or satan and it's up to you and i like like we know he makes us a free moral agent it's up to you and i to choose whose side you're going to be on you know that's the thing it says that you know you got to choose he makes us a free moral agent you know you can serve me or you know if you don't serve me you get no in between there's no purgatory so we find that so tonight we want to like we say is we want to say uh a servants to sin you know i i was thinking about hero says you know one thing about adam and eve they didn't they didn't know um they didn't have no knowledge of what sin was or no knowledge of what it was to be a servant to sin or anything like that because they were they were serving you know god the living god and they were enjoying themselves i believe in the garden of eden but they didn't realize that you know here come uh satan and and the serpent comes you know and begin to begin to talking with them the first thing he did he attacked uh do we know he attacked the word of god begin to attack and say i know god said this but you know bringing it that before them but i said the thing is you can't have two masters you can't serve you can't serve god and you can't have two masters what they what what the devil done in that time i believe he became a voice to them so not only did they have the voice of god now you know the voice of satan was in the air and that's what it is you know uh we got to try the spirit by the spirit there's so many voices that are in the air today so many so many voices and a lot of times those voices might sound true but it takes the holy ghost it takes the spirit of god to be able to recognize the true voice of god and where that voice is coming from that's why you know it is so the devil himself he's so crafty i believe it says that he's wiser than daniel and if it were possible you know the bible says that he in the end he would deceive the very elect if it was possible because that's how close the spirits would be and you know when you even sit back and and meditate on that it makes you just want to draw and get that much closer to god because you want to be able to recognize that hey this is this isn't god or hey this is the voice of god because you can be uh wound up and uh i say and caught in in deception and that's why i believe in the scriptures how it says men ought to pray always come on you ought to always pray always have that communion and fellowship with god if you don't do nothing else you ought to always have some type of fellowship and communion with god that way you'll be able to distinguish his voice from any other voice how many believe that tonight but we find that like i said they didn't know they they didn't know uh uh they didn't know what sin was they didn't have you know no idea what bondage wasn't like or what real bondage was but they was about to find out i believe that they didn't know that by their actions uh just we know that the bible says that he was deceived and adam wasn't but just to know that the actions that we we get ready to take these things are going to separate us from the tree of life they're going to separate us from god and many times even we we come to crossroads i believe in our lives we come to decisions in our lives and sometimes we let we listen to the flesh and let the flesh overcome us but not knowing that that decision that you make that action that you take might be what separates you from that presence separate you you know god has had so much grace on us because the bible says even when you were dead in trespassing sin that he says that that christ he still died for the ungodly he still loved us he still made a way to reconcile you back to him because he didn't want you to be separated from him he wanted you to be in that presence so if he's done that for you and i i say why not take advantage of what the grace of god has done for you and i you know sometimes we know that people can get caught up in situations and they don't get second chances from it some people are are dead in their grave and they didn't get a second chance from the decision they made some people are locked up in jail due in life some people are are caught up had got all kind of lives messed up because they didn't get a second chance from the decision that they made but i want to say when god when you the day you hear his voice the bible say heart not your heart come on because when you hear in his voice god has given you a second chance some of us god has given a third and fourth and fifth chance and yet we keep playing with that grace but i want to say we don't want to play with that grace but we want to seize that that opportunity come on how many want to do that tonight but we find that like we said i said they didn't understand the actions that they were that they that they made the action they made was gonna um was going to separate them from the presence of god and a lot of times we don't understand that we we ain't going to know how much you you're going to need or miss that presence until it ain't there how much you know uh um i i like how i was listening to something the other day and it reminded me of a song it says after all that i've been through i still got joy come on and you know what gives you that joy the presence of god you know what gives you that joy of the spirit of god that after all you've been through you still got joy because there's something on the inside of you that's still reminding you of a hope that god ain't dead and he's still alive i don't care what the situation looks like i'm reminded of of jesus at the tomb of lazarus been dead four days but even in there he said roll away the stone come on because over though even though he'd been dead four days there was still a hope that he was gonna rise even martha said he said i know that in the last days you know you'll raise them up and jesus began to talk to her about i am the resurrection in life but even her statement was even now lord because you know long as god was still there it was still a hope and that's what it is so we're finding that uh uh even like it says today you won't miss that presence until that presence is gone you won't miss it until all the hope is gone until you you crossed over to a place the way you don't you don't know for sure whether god gonna deliver you or not you don't know of god because you knew better but you didn't you didn't do right you you willfully went out there and did it anyway but i said the thing about it is why be on that side why not be enjoying you know god's got blessings he wants you to enjoy those blessings god wants to to put you up in a place the way he can show you off come on i believe that god's got people he wanted to show off that hey even though they was oppressed even though there was a uh a burden on every side even though the whole world was against me they still stood they made it through the tests of the storms and the rain why because they had faith in me they kept their confidence in me and i delivered just as i promised i would come on god got somebody he want to show off even in the midst of what we're going through right now faced with the um the world as i was i was uh on my knees thinking about i said you know the world right now is shaking up not only is we dealing you know with the with the uh civil things that's going on in the world today with race you're dealing with corona you're dealing with a hurricane that is tearing up in the country and sometimes they don't even consider that more than the other politics and things that they got going on in the world today you see what it is a lot of times we think and we put our trust in men and put our trust and money and put our trust in all these things that don't care nothing about you but it's something about jesus jesus cares he even cares about the shoes you got on your feet he cares about the next meal he cares about everything about you your every wick your every well-being why not serve the living god come on why not put your confidence and your trust in him he'll never leave you nor forsake you but he'll be with you he said even in you until the end of the world i like how he says in the scriptures though your mother and father forsake your god will take you up that's the kind of god that we serve that when everybody else give up on your god ain't gonna never give up on you hallelujah when people don't recognize your god they'll still recognize you how many believe that but we find that like it says here you know they they didn't know recognize you know uh they didn't even know what real bondage was like come on we're talking about two masters they didn't know what and the servant to send they didn't know what real bondage was like they they didn't know what all these things were like but they was about to find find out and what it is the actions that they took there in the garden of eden they throw the whole you not only the human race but the whole world out of cater it throwed everything out now you know uh we was the world was about to experience and know what sin was like what what killing and what death and all these things was life but one thing about god garden still in all of that he made a way of escape and all of that he had a plan to reconcile us back you know in god's mind even though he know these things was gonna happen he had a plan to get you and i back to him he had a plan that that i'm gonna i'm gonna bring them i'm gonna bring them back into fellowship with me because i don't want them to be separated me from that way but i got a plan i got a way i'm gonna make them to be able to bring them back but the thing is he ain't gonna force you to take that way back that way that he made uh uh uh for you to come back it's about it it's by choice now we know that you know things are predestinated they say this is your lot this is your destiny but still yet god placed in you in man a choice that hey i made a way of escape for you you don't have to stay in that condition you win you don't have to and and it doesn't matter what what uh uh uh things that you were born with in your family that might have flicked you from the womb that might afflict you from your life you might have things that was passed down from generation to generation but god had a way had a way of escape to get you out of those generational curses he had a way that i'm gonna break that even though your father your grandfather this one might have seen if you come my provided way i'ma break that curse off you and i'mma get you back how is that through the baptism of the holy ghost he said if you repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost come on we ain't got to beg for it all we got to do is obey god and god is going to do what he said he said and the promise is unto you i know your children curse but the promise is to your children too i know your children's children are cursed but the promise is to them as well god has made a way of escape to bring us back hallelujah to the tree of life bring us back to fellowship with him how many believe that tonight i don't know about you but i said you know as they sing the song god is god what he says god has done delivered me why should i be bound come on i don't know how the song exactly i said but it's something like that he said the lord has delivered me why should i be bound when you think about what the lord has done for you why are you bound to the sin why are you bound to generation of curses why are you bound to heal and come on god does not deliver you why should you be bound hallelujah i say get up and praise god i say shout your way out i say give god to glory for all that he's done for you he don't deliver you you don't have to be bound how many believe that glory to god you know i telling my wife i said i became a different person sometimes looking in the scriptures that's what it takes you you got to indulge in the word come on somebody some people they don't like to look in the word come on you got to get in the word and meditate in it come on and let it do something in your life because what next thing you know you start just quoting it you start just and something you just start believing it come on and when you start believing as things start to happen you start walking different you start talking different your bodies start feeling different why because it's power in that word it's life you don't you know in the word of god you know it says that that that uh god said let there be light come on let there be he spoke and it was so much power in that word that things begin to move because of what the word of god spoke and if it had that power then it's got that same power now only thing you got to do is speak that word let that hear that word you know faith coming by hearing and hearing the word of god it ain't just sermons it ain't just letters it ain't just a book or a story that we're reading but it's life taking place it's something moving when you hear that word it's something moving when you speak that word you might can't see it but it's moving why because it's the power of god making it move how many believe that hallelujah but we find that it says god is you know uh he's he's so good to us and he made a way even that out of all of that that we can be reconciled you know come on we find ourselves born into a dark world come on born into chaos born into a mess born in the sin but yet when we look up we see the light all we got to do is make it to that light all we got to do is run like let's say i'm running for my life run to that light i don't know about you but when god began dealing with my heart it wasn't it wasn't an easing in it was running in it was a place it was a point in my life that i realized hey i got to run for my life i got to get away from the things god has set me free if i don't run and make it to that safe place if i don't make it to that place of refuge then i'm gonna get bound again come on then i'm gonna get destroyed the destroyer is out there you got to run for your life you got to make it to that safe place hallelujah but we find that like it says you know uh uh they were separated but god you know made a way for them to get back but like we were saying on on the other week we was talking about the the two masters saying you know the biggest problem is is that people they want to serve god they want to live just enough to like we said to get the blessings of god because they know they're going to need his blessings and his power but yet they still want to indulge in the in the things of the world but you can't serve two masters he said you're gonna either you're gonna either love one or hate the other but these what it is these masters you know what are they doing they they battling for control you know you know the greatest battle we know that ever fought is in your mind says why is it in your mind because that's where the decisions are made come on and the thing is what are they doing you know some say call it the battle of the wheels they're battling they're battling for control that same battle that raised in heaven you know michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels but you know what happened the dragon was cast out but that same battle that raised in heaven it now fell to earth and became battle of men where is the war where's the battleground we say the battleground is in your mind come on you got a decision to make the night oh you're going to serve the living god oh you're going to are you going to become a servant to sin as we were saying here in the scriptures and we'll hopefully we'll get into that you'll be a servant to sin and once you become you know a servant of sin all these things whatever they do they bring about death come on not only do they bring about natural death but in the end it brings about a spiritual death an eternal we look at a separation from god the bible says the wages of sin is death come on you paying to die you're paying for it come on the wages of sin is death but the gift of god god is freely giving it to you god is freely giving you a gift come on of eternal life do you want that gift you know i've been i've been uh uh finding myself just trying to encourage i says you know do you want that gift come on it didn't cost it didn't cost me nothing to give my life to the lord the only thing i did i just came freely lord here i am i want to accept what you've done for me and you serve god because you serve god you give god your all because you love him because you're thankful for what he's done for you you re you now got a revelation of the plan of salvation he opened your eyes to where you could have been matter of fact the way you should have been that's what god opened your eyes to and then you're more you love them and the more you say god come on i don't want you to ever let your hands off of me god i thank god that we can't that we're not asked to keep ourselves the bible says we are kept by the power of god you ain't asked to keep yourself god is keeping you god is the one holding on to you how many believe that tonight god is so good but i find out that what it is it's a battle even in a lot of lives today it took me back to you know a testimony of how me and brother carl were down in in orangeburg and and just to make a story short there was a man you know he was at the crack house and had a full suit on come on he had a full suit on at the crack house and the man tears started coming down at his eyes and he said he told me brother carly says you know he says i got dressed to go to church this morning he says but i never made it come on i could see that inside of this it did something to us that we begin to pray in for this man right there in front of the crack house with all our hearts because what it is it's a battle going on the man i believe is something inside of that man he wanted to serve god he made the effort to go but what it is the crack demon had him bound come on the master or the crack demon had him even though he wanted to serve god the other the master had him and i said the thing about it is i know someone that can set you free from that master i know someone that can set you free from that but sometimes you know and we don't understand uh uh just like we said the decisions that we made i heard it told to me many times don't ever try you know crack cocaine and say that's a one-time addiction it'll do something to you and from that time point you'll be chasing after that high or something and it says a lot of times people that do certain drugs they never fully get deliverance from it but it can be 20 or 30 years they'll find themselves go back to it now i said that might be true but if they ever get hold to the holy ghost or the holy ghost ever comes inside of them then that master can't have no more control over them or dominion i don't care how he raises his ugly head because the real master is here now the same one that throw them out of heaven is now dwelling on the inside of them they can still have deliverance hallelujah i won't tell them there ain't no hope there is hope i don't mean to yell but there is hope come on i can't say that there ain't no hope don't be scared come on be glad come on run to god with all your heart give god your life then you can dance all over the devil ahead then you can go out and testify then you can be a true witness of the power of god hallelujah oh he's the real master come on but we find that like we said it's a struggle sometimes it's a battle that people you know say they want to serve god but the devil you know uh got them bound and how it says here it says he said he was that's why he was a begging or pleading i believe with the people he was saying you know not to yield your members as instruments and unrighteousness to sin but he was saying you know yield yourself to god don't yield yourself to sin because he talked about when you yielded yourself he says you know you're in bondage to those things your drugs might have not been your bondage but it was something you know that had you in bondage had you in in captivity you might have said it didn't but you couldn't you couldn't get free from it you couldn't uh uh be delivered from it but he says is it come a time when he keeps saying thanks be to god because it come a time when god came in come on and the battle was over the struggle was over i like how in the scriptures he says that i come to uh set the captive free come on i've come to preach deliverance to the captive to set free them that abound because jesus knew that you know the people were bound he knew that they were in bondage so he says i come to i come to set him free come on but when he's when he sets you free um that's what uh paul was saying just as you yield yourselves and you were servants to sin come on when you yield when god sets you free yield yourself to god that way come on be like paul many times he talks about in his testimony uh how he says that uh i murdered the church of god i i was a pharisee of the pharisee i did this he talked about all the things that he did and how yeah he was he was just so disruptive in in the sin that he was in but then he began to talk about how christ set him free come on and how he says now as i was a servant to those things now i serve the living god he even called himself sometimes i'm a prisoner for the lord come on i'm serving the lord and that's i'm serving the lord i'm a prisoner for him i'm giving him all just as i gave it my all when i was on the other side i'm going to give it my all to them that's what it is yielding yourself to god don't hold nothing back here i am lord use me god use use my hands use my feet god use if you want whatever you want to get out of me lord i like how it says consume me lord with the fire of your spirit god used me when i was used by the devil i let him have his way and god i want to let you have your way now that i'm free as i yielded myself to that god i want to yield myself to you completely because you find out that if you don't sell out to god that other master will come back come on he'll find a way to start speaking to your mind again he'll find a way to start speaking and remember you can't serve both of them now you're gonna love one and hate the other it'll bring you it'll bring you sometimes back into bondage i said you got to silence that voice tonight how do you silence that voice do the word of god come on you know the prophet of god talked about eve greatest mistake was when she stopped to listen you shouldn't stop and listen when those things come into your mind come on begin praising god tell the devil get behind me i'm going on to serve the living god you i was telling my wife last night and certain things we don't have to do you don't have to argue with with people or argue with certain things or spirits and all those things just go on come on and serve the lord because when you stop to argue when you stop the debate what it does it messes your spirit all up it gets all of your spirits get you all entangled with things and then what happens you find yourself separated from the presence of god the anointing leaves your life and all those things i said come on let's not do those things let's get to the place where our mind is solely on christ and christ himself come on that's the only way we're going to stay with god we got to stay with love lord no matter what god i'm going to serve you no matter what god i'ma go on with you because nothing else matters anyway lord but giving you all nothing else matters lord but pleasing you right now come on let my body be burned let me be thrown in jail let me be talked about long as i can be pleasing to god hallelujah that's what it's about pleasing the lord how many believe that but we find that like he says servants paul used that terminology he said you were servants to sin come on you were servants you were in bondage he says but now look what god has done now that that crisis has set you free he says don't you he says yield your members to god come on yield yourself to god i want to say whatever gift god has given you yield it to god give it back to god be glad to be whatever it is god ordained out of your life give it back to god come on that's when your blessings that that's where you're gonna see the spirit of god flowing your life that's when you're gonna be blessed and and god is gonna bless you when you learn how to give it back to god whatever it is whatever god give you give it back to him and watch the blessings flow on your life i didn't want to be long tonight what i'd say is come on we're still talking about two masters come on the servant like it says service to sin don't be service to sin he says but be servants as he was saying i want to read here and he said to me the righteousness he says i speak out to the manner of men because of in the 19th verse the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members service to uncleanness and iniquity until iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when you were servants of sin uh you were free from unrighteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed i don't know about you but i was ashamed i was ashamed when i was a servant of sin those fruits that came out i'm ashamed of them come on i was ashamed of them he says but for the end of those things are death but now being made free come on the master has made you free tonight free from sin and become he says but now being made free from sin and become the servants of god you have fruits unto holiness and the end everlasting life come on yield yourselves to guard i says i says a lot of times what it is as individuals you can have you can have claims on something that that's not true you can say that hey i serve the lord and maybe people might think so from the outside and and and you could we as individuals sometimes can fool each other fool me and all that but it's something about it you can't we can't uh deceive the spirit of god you know the bible says the word of god is more quick it's quick and powerful sharpen any two-edged sword it'll divide those things it can go down and see the real you come on but that's why i like how in the scriptures it says you know the tree is known by the fruited bear you know i always was saying that and one thing i said the tree ain't the tree is to say that's what make the tree i mean the fruit of the tree ain't what make sometimes to say it's it's a tree bad or good but it just identifies what type of tree it is so we can have we can profess things but we gonna look at the fruits come on because the fruits is going to identify the life that's in that tree the fruits is going to identify the life they're saying you say we talk about fruits a lot of times we might think about just miracles and powers come on but we know that gifts and callings are without repentance but we're talking about a life he says that you would bring forth the fruits of holiness you know it's a lifestyle it's a way it's it's fruits that that that comes out of you that the world can't duplicate that satan himself can't duplicate it's certain fruits that come out and that's what i says lord what it is with that life come out god let it be the right fruit god come on let it be the right fruit god bless you so i get praise god i get joy when i think about what he's done for me amen all you got to do is think about what god has done for you i get joy when i think about what he's done for me amen you know i i i look around and i said we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the earth amen when we don't even feel like being happy we ought to be happy amen why because amen god set us three we're free from sin we're free from shame god has bought us from a mighty long way
