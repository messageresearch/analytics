[33:24] afflicted.
[33:26] Amen. Thank you, Lord, for touching. Oh,
[33:28] God. Brother Nathan,
[33:31] brother and sister Paige and Diplace,
[33:36] Lord, continue to move in the life,
[33:38] Father. Father, we look to you now. We
[33:42] love you. We appreciate you. We thank
[33:44] you in Jesus Christ's wonderful name.
[33:47] Amen.

[33:52] &gt;&gt; The book of 2 Corinthians 6
[33:58] and three.
[34:00] As you turn in there, I start reading.
[34:04] We then as workers together with him
[34:08] beseech you also that you receive not
[34:10] the grace of God in vain.
[34:13] For he said,
[34:16] I've heard thee in a time accepted, and
[34:21] in the day of salvation have I suckered
[34:25] thee. Behold, now is the accepted time.
[34:30] Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[34:34] Give no offense in anything that the
[34:38] ministry be not blamed,
[34:41] but in all things,
[34:44] approving ourselves as a what?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Ministers of God. ministers of God in
[34:50] much patient
[34:52] in afflictions, in distress, and in I
[34:56] mean in necess necessities
[35:00] in distress.
[35:04] In what?
[35:06] &gt;&gt; And in prison and in what?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And in labor and in what?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And in fasting
[35:15] by puress and by what? knowledge

[35:29] &gt;&gt; Power of God. by the arm of
[35:33] righteousness on the right hand and
[35:39] &gt;&gt; the left.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; By honor and
[35:43] &gt;&gt; dishonor
[35:44] &gt;&gt; by evil report and
[35:46] &gt;&gt; good report. As deceivers and yet
[35:50] &gt;&gt; true.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; As unknown yet.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; As dying and behold, we
[35:58] &gt;&gt; live.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; As chastened and
[36:01] &gt;&gt; not.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; As sorrowful yet,
[36:05] &gt;&gt; always rejoicing.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; As poor yet,
[36:09] &gt;&gt; making rich.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; As having nothing.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; God bless the word. You may be seated.
[36:20] Possessing all things tonight.
[36:24] Amen.
[36:26] Yet possessing all things
[36:31] and we
[36:33] I I was telling them down in Mullins on
[36:35] last night that we were just going to
[36:38] dwell with faith for a while
[36:41] and uh possessing all things.
[36:45] He says in the 10th verse,
[36:49] "And having what?" Nothing.
[36:53] And having nothing but yet what?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Possessing all things.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Possessing all things.
[37:02] You understand that you possess all
[37:04] things?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't you say, "Well, I ain't
[37:09] got nothing
[37:10] as having nothing." But you got
[37:13] something. Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; But you have something.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; I say you have what?
[37:18] &gt;&gt; All things.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Look at somebody. Tell them you got all.
[37:21] You have all things.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; You have all things.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; You have all things.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't feel sorry for
[37:29] yourself.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we go on pity trips and
[37:34] be feeling so bad. But you got to know
[37:36] who you are.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; You possess what?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; All things.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; All things. You possess all things. You
[37:44] possess all things. [clears throat]
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; It's got to get over.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; And until this get over, then I might be
[37:52] here for the next 6 months.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Possessing what?
[37:59] &gt;&gt; All things.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; You got to understand that you possess
[38:06] all things.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then the book of Genesis
[38:10] 14,
[38:12] possessing all things. Having nothing
[38:15] but possessing all things.
[38:19] Isn't that good?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing but yet you
[38:22] possess all things.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; As poor, but you're making many rich.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:33] The reason why people as Christians are
[38:35] so down because they uh they're not
[38:40] comfortable with who they are.
[38:44] They their identity they have an in
[38:49] identity crisis. [snorts]
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they cannot identify
[38:57] with who God say I am. Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; But as long as your mind cannot
[39:04] comprehend it, as long as your heart
[39:06] cannot believe it, then you will always
[39:09] feel like
[39:13] down.
[39:16] You feel like,
[39:18] Amen. you don't possess all things.
[39:21] Amen. But when you know that you know
[39:24] that you possess all things
[39:27] &gt;&gt; it causes you to walk with a different
[39:30] kind of attitude.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know you possess all
[39:35] things.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you don't know that then
[39:40] you somewhat uh you know that's why
[39:42] Christians are so unhappy.
[39:46] Amen.
[39:47] because they don't know and have not
[39:50] really realized what God is saying about
[39:53] you and to you. Until you believe it,
[39:56] you cannot act upon it.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; You cannot manifest if you don't
[40:02] believe.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Until you believe, then it comes
[40:07] forth a manifestation.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[40:11] You can sit in these chairs and can
[40:13] don't and you you don't believe you can
[40:15] walk.
[40:17] You never move.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; People have to toach you out of here
[40:22] until you believe I can stand up and
[40:23] walk. But you you said, "I I I
[40:28] can walk. I ain't got to believe that."
[40:30] Yes, you do.
[40:33] If your mind tell you you can't walk,
[40:35] you sure won't walk.
[40:39] Are you with me?
[40:41] &gt;&gt; But it's something about subconsciously
[40:44] you just take for granted and believe
[40:47] that you can walk
[40:49] &gt;&gt; and you get up and walk. Are you with
[40:51] me?
[40:53] &gt;&gt; But we don't want it. We want faith to
[40:55] be so much and so that you can act upon
[40:58] it without even thinking about it.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; You can say it with your mouth. You can
[41:05] believe it in your heart. It becomes so
[41:07] common to you.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you don't walk by sight.
[41:12] You walk by what?
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time the negativeivity
[41:18] comes upon you, you can say, "Amen. Yes,
[41:22] I can do all things."
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Through Christ that strengthened me.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; With Christ, all things are possible.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; So, I I begin to move into another
[41:31] realm. I begin to be a a a new creature
[41:34] in Christ. This is a new creation. I I
[41:36] I'm of a new creation. I've been born
[41:38] again. I've come into a faith realm.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And and I'm walking in a faith
[41:43] civilization and I'm sitting in heavenly
[41:45] places in Christ Jesus. I'm no more of
[41:48] this world. Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. But that's the right mental
[41:56] attitude.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Let this mind be in
[42:00] you." That was what?
[42:03] And Christ says, "I come from God and I
[42:05] go to God."
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[42:08] &gt;&gt; He told him, "No man take my life. I lay
[42:09] it down. I got the power to take it up
[42:11] again."
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. When the devil attack you,
[42:14] you got to attack. Uh, Amen. Let him
[42:17] know who you are.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's written. [clears throat]
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Man should not live by bread alone, but
[42:24] by every word that proceeded out of the
[42:26] mouth of God.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Don't look at what he says. Don't look
[42:29] at your condition. Don't look at your
[42:30] symptoms, but you look at the word.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; I was telling Sister Paige, I said,
[42:35] "Look at the word." Amen. Don't look at
[42:37] symptoms. Don't look at what the doctor
[42:38] say. Don't look back at what you feel.
[42:40] You say what the word say. That's what
[42:42] you're looking at.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; You looking at the word
[42:46] &gt;&gt; and what the word said about it. That's
[42:47] what you believe.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; And I say you walk out of here.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Looking at the word,
[42:55] &gt;&gt; not looking at what they say. Oh, I told
[42:58] brother Pa, I said, "Look at the word."
[43:01] &gt;&gt; You look at Jesus. Look to Jesus.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And we got to start looking at Jesus.
[43:05] When you go, Amen. Don't look at the
[43:07] condition of a person. Look at what the
[43:09] word say about it.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not walking by sight.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; You're walking by faith.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; You can look down. Oh, I feel sorry for
[43:19] them. You what? That's a child of God.
[43:22] You speak the word.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; You possess of all things. What? Why?
[43:27] Why cry? Speak.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to be shrieking faith in
[43:31] your brother, speaking faith in your
[43:34] sister. Speak in the word.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; We're workers together with him.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to work. This ministry is
[43:42] not just a one-man ministry. It's not
[43:44] just the 54. We're all ambassadors in
[43:47] Christ.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a part of the ministry.
[43:52] You're just as much a part as the
[43:54] pastor, the teacher, or the pastor, or
[43:56] the prophet. You just as much a part of
[43:59] God's ministry as they are.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; You might not have the same office, but
[44:03] your ministry is the same. These signs
[44:06] shall what?
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Follow them.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; them that believe.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer?
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Then you look for things to happen
[44:13] &gt;&gt; because you believe.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; You look for things to happen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[44:24] I said I was saying I I said I don't
[44:27] want people to stop this move of faith
[44:30] because I I realize people are so
[44:33] hindered and so down till they got to be
[44:36] built back up in faith.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling Mullins and Jeremiah
[44:42] and Connie and different ones know there
[44:44] was a spirit of faith that people used
[44:46] to come from everywhere
[44:48] for prayer. They didn't had to be a part
[44:50] of us. They come to the church to get
[44:53] healing. Are you with me? Because it was
[44:57] a faith realm. And people could see the
[45:00] pillar of fire and the supernatural. It
[45:03] needs to be recreated.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Faith. We need to be built back up.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If it never was a time in
[45:12] your life that you seen God move, Amen.
[45:15] you need to look to God to move in your
[45:18] life. Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; You need to know that God Amen.
[45:22] [laughter] Hallelujah.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; The power of God is here for to be
[45:26] activated. And you, Amen, want to be a
[45:29] part of this.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Just as much as you want to
[45:32] be a part of the rapture and you say you
[45:34] are in the rapture and you're a part of
[45:36] it, you are the rapture.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Then you got to have
[45:42] rapturing faith.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. As I said the other day,
[45:45] Amen. Enoch kept walking and he pleased
[45:47] God. He walked by faith
[45:50] &gt;&gt; till he walked out of here.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; You got to walk by faith.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Walk out of here. Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Walk in the power of the Holy Ghost. Let
[45:59] Jesus have the preeminence.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Um, Genesis 14. I got to be real short.
[46:08] We got communion tonight. So, God is
[46:12] good. Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; But God is good.
[46:17] uh 18th verse
[46:20] Genesis 14:18
[46:22] it says and Melzdc king of Salem bought
[46:25] for bread and what
[46:28] &gt;&gt; so many people say bought forth bread
[46:30] and grape grape grape juice
[46:35] bread and grape juice
[46:37] &gt;&gt; was that what y'all read
[46:41] huh
[46:44] see people scared to do what the Bible
[46:46] say
[46:48] they scared that
[46:51] if they take communion they become an
[46:54] alcoholic.
[46:56] This ain't no alcohol. This is the
[46:58] blood. Take it. Praise God.
[47:01] This represent the blood.
[47:04] Praise God. Are you with me? Well, you
[47:07] take it as alcohol. Yeah. You get drunk.
[47:09] [snorts]
[47:10] Are you with me? Will you take it as
[47:13] This is the blood. This is his blood.
[47:16] Are you with me? This represent the
[47:19] blood of Jesus Christ to take away our
[47:21] sins. And we're looking to see God
[47:25] forgive us of all our sins.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And if we're sick, we know that the
[47:30] blood of Jesus Christ when it's applied
[47:33] to the toe pole and to the lint and the
[47:36] blood of a animal, the lamb, Amen.
[47:40] Praise God. The shoes didn't wear out.
[47:42] Amen. Their clothes didn't wear out and
[47:44] they were healed. They didn't get sick.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; And we take communion. Amen.
[47:48] Understanding that this is the blood
[47:50] that for of Jesus. This represent his
[47:52] blood. And God said, "You do this in
[47:55] remembrance of me."
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And it's for my forgiveness of my sin.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the blood did.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] Come with the attitude.
[48:09] I I I can't do that because it's
[48:14] come on. You got all kind of excuses why
[48:16] we don't do what the scripture say and
[48:19] we scared of it.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; So everybody just get the little round
[48:23] wafer. You know the little sun god.
[48:29] That's what the round wafer represent.
[48:31] The Catholic church sun god. Are you
[48:34] with me?
[48:36] And they they do that for communion. Are
[48:40] you with me? But he said, "This is my
[48:43] body which is broken for you."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Unleavened bread. Isn't that right?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Not the son of God.
[48:54] Are you with me? Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; See the Catholic church, they take the
[48:58] son God and they say they got the power
[49:02] to make [clears throat] this
[49:05] round wafer.
[49:08] They got the power when the priest spray
[49:12] it becomes the litter body of Jesus
[49:14] Christ and you eating his literally
[49:18] body.
[49:20] And that's why the Protestant broke
[49:22] away. He said this is represents his
[49:26] body but this is not his it represents
[49:30] but it's not the lit body of Jesus
[49:32] Christ.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And they don't have the priests got the
[49:38] power to do that. Praise God. So by the
[49:42] grace of God and it caused the
[49:44] reformation.
[49:46] Are you with me?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; So some of y'all might not understand
[49:49] what I'm saying but some of y'all know
[49:51] what I'm talking about.
[49:53] the litter.
[49:55] So, it represents the body and it
[49:59] represents the blood.
[50:02] Okay,
[50:04] y'all. All right,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; I got off my subject of faith.
[50:08] [laughter]
[50:09] But it must be something needed to be
[50:11] said here because people want to walk in
[50:14] darkness. Be it's no use in walking in
[50:17] darkness when the light has come.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:21] And we know most of the people, most of
[50:23] the world do it wrong. They do
[50:25] everything else wrong. They baptized
[50:27] wrong and they do all all kind of things
[50:30] wrong.
[50:32] So when they take communion,
[50:34] you need to be dedicated to the Lord.
[50:37] You need to say, "Well, I want to live
[50:39] for him." So I'm taking communion
[50:42] identifying with that
[50:46] I am a Christian and I'm I've dedicated
[50:49] my life to him.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Some say I can't take it cuz I ain't
[50:56] perfect yet.
[50:58] You perfect in Christ.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And and the blood cover you.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And if you you say, "Well, I am a
[51:08] believer
[51:10] and I'm one that's, you know,
[51:14] I'm one of those crucified one. I'm
[51:16] dying daily."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:21] &gt;&gt; You ought to live a crucified life.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; And that that's that ought to be your
[51:25] heart
[51:26] &gt;&gt; where your heart is. You you you say,
[51:29] "Well,
[51:31] you know, I I really want to be honest.
[51:34] I really want to be straight. I'm not
[51:36] just going to take communion and I I
[51:38] don't want to live right and I ain't
[51:40] ready to do right. But I'm willing in my
[51:43] heart I want to do everything to please
[51:45] the Lord.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; That's my heart.

[51:58] thing.

[52:03] Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; But here go people taking come in don't

[52:10] know the baptized or ain't baptized and
[52:14] ain't living right and they don't care.
[52:16] Just take it. You know what I'm saying?
[52:19] It becomes a ritual. Just something you
[52:21] do every first Sunday.
[52:23] Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; But it ought not be a ritual. It ought
[52:26] to be something for real
[52:28] &gt;&gt; that means something. Lord, I'm taking
[52:31] it. Amen. You said our sins are
[52:36] remitted. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Well,

[52:42] communion now.
[52:45] But anyway,
[52:49] see when Lot went away
[52:54] and I mean the kings came and took Lot
[52:59] and
[53:01] Abraham heard that
[53:03] the kings come and made war and took Lot
[53:06] out of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham heard
[53:09] about it. When Abraham heard Abraham is
[53:13] backslitting brother,
[53:15] he going after him.

[53:21] backslitting. Just let him go.

[53:25] But Abraham went after Lot. Lot went and
[53:29] chose the best,
[53:31] the green pasture, and everything looked
[53:33] good, but it cost him. Are you with me?
[53:38] But Abraham cared enough about Lot. He
[53:40] even loved him enough that we're going
[53:42] to pursue him.
[53:46] And he's supposed to be soldiers and
[53:48] warriors. Abraham a farmer and his
[53:51] herdmen and his men and they go out
[53:54] there probably with you know sticks and
[53:57] all going to pursue.
[54:00] Oh, what's wrong with Abraham? These
[54:02] warriors
[54:04] done took them kings and all, but
[54:07] Abraham went out. But
[54:10] Abraham had faith.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm going to get my brother.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever I got, I'm going in the name of
[54:22] the Lord God Almighty.

[54:44] Abraham come back with the victory.
[54:47] Isn't that good?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Come back with Lot and the victory. And
[54:52] God is able to give you victory.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter how many how
[54:58] strong the devil think he got a
[55:00] stronghold over your brother's sister's
[55:02] life. Amen. You go after them in the
[55:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I
[55:08] bring my brother, I bring my sister back

[1:11:04] things.

[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You are healed.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; 2000 I'm believing on my salvation. God,
[1:12:38] I believe you'll save me after a while.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; No, he died 2,000 years ago. He He
[1:12:43] already died for your sin.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven already.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord.
[1:12:50] [laughter] That's That happened 2,000
[1:12:52] years ago. And you still struggling.
[1:12:55] Anybody here want to be saved? Yeah, me.
[1:12:59] That's your mindset. You get saved every
[1:13:02] service.
[1:13:03] Why? Cuz the devil talk you out of it
[1:13:05] soon you leave. So, you got to get saved
[1:13:08] again. Anybody want to be saved? I want
[1:13:10] to be saved. Anybody want Anybody want
[1:13:12] to be healed? I want to be healed every
[1:13:14] service. You want to be saved every
[1:13:15] service? God, I want to I want this I
[1:13:19] want this monkey off my back.
[1:13:22] I I want this thing. I want to get over
[1:13:24] this thing. I want to get over it. I
[1:13:26] want to get over it. We rebuke it and
[1:13:29] say, "Devil, leave them."
[1:13:34] By the time you walk back to the seat,
[1:13:36] the devil say, "I ain't going nowhere."
[1:13:38] He said, "Yeah." He said, "You feel it?
[1:13:40] Do you feel anything?" He said, "I ain't
[1:13:42] felt a thing." You ain't felt nothing.
[1:13:46] I felt something when I was up there,
[1:13:48] but I He said, "You you feel it now?" He
[1:13:51] said, "No, I don't feel it now." See,
[1:13:54] the Bible didn't say walk by feeling,
[1:13:56] did it?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; She said, "Walk by what?"
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; So, what the devil talk you in, you
[1:14:02] don't feel no better, do you?
[1:14:05] See, the devil just took you back. You
[1:14:07] done backslid that fast. Come up here
[1:14:10] and you know something lifted up off you
[1:14:12] and you felt like Amen.
[1:14:15] something moved.
[1:14:17] Sat in the service and all of a sudden
[1:14:19] the spirit just swept over you. Amen.
[1:14:21] Amen. You forgot about your burdens. You
[1:14:24] forgot about Amen. the things that were
[1:14:26] troubling you. All of a sudden you're
[1:14:28] saying, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And the devil said,
[1:14:33] Mm- You ain't getting off that easy.
[1:14:36] You're not getting out of here that
[1:14:38] easy.
[1:14:40] Amen. Ain't nothing changed.
[1:14:44] You still the same. And then you accept
[1:14:47] him and you believe what he says.
[1:14:51] See, you can't even believe what you
[1:14:54] hear in your head that's negative.
[1:14:57] Because that's not you. And that's the
[1:14:59] devil speaking to you.
[1:15:02] You got to be able to distinguish when
[1:15:05] God is speaking. And when the devil is
[1:15:07] speaking, when you know God is speaking,
[1:15:10] he's speaking positive. He's speaking
[1:15:12] the word. Amen. He's building your
[1:15:15] faith. Uh it's telling you you can Amen.
[1:15:19] And you will
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Receive what God says is yours.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Don't you doubt. Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Don't I'm I said I'm I'm going be here
[1:15:34] for a while. Praise God. I don't know
[1:15:36] how to I don't know how to stop, but I
[1:15:39] know that the church need to be built in
[1:15:41] faith.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] Faith workketh by love.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:15:51] Can I read one more verse? Are y'all
[1:15:53] ready to go? Y'all got to go home and
[1:15:55] get some rest.
[1:15:58] Ephesians 4,
[1:16:02] a little bit different than the Mullins,
[1:16:04] but I think I talked about this. 4 and
[1:16:06] 32. I just skip over the rest so you can
[1:16:09] read the whole fourth chapter if you
[1:16:10] want to.
[1:16:12] It says, "And be ye what?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Kind to one another."
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Kind one to another.
[1:16:20] I'm going tell you, I've seen a lot of
[1:16:22] Christians, a lot of people say, I
[1:16:24] believe the message. I'm Christian. I'm
[1:16:26] saved. [snorts]
[1:16:29] But they kind to some people, but they
[1:16:31] ain't kind to everybody.
[1:16:33] Some people can be mean, can't they?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You think Jesus could switch on people
[1:16:39] and do that all kind? But he said, "Be
[1:16:41] you kind
[1:16:43] one to another."
[1:16:45] Can you be kind?
[1:16:48] Not only he wants you to be kind, but he
[1:16:50] wants you to be what?
[1:16:54] You know sometimes the men has to be
[1:16:56] showing they mity
[1:16:59] or whatever I put the word there.
[1:17:03] They got to be so macho
[1:17:06] but be kind
[1:17:09] one to another and be what?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; It's that's why you know see
[1:17:16] sisters can be closer and they more
[1:17:19] tender hearted. Men got to be I'm
[1:17:21] standing up to show you to prove that
[1:17:23] I'm a man. I'm the man of the house. I'm
[1:17:24] the man of the church. And here the
[1:17:27] preacher ought to be a man and ought to
[1:17:29] throw you kick them out and ought to
[1:17:31] tell them, "Oh Lord, I'm a man." Oh,
[1:17:35] they want a man. [snorts]
[1:17:38] Tell everybody they're going to hell if
[1:17:40] they don't do what I say. Oh no, please.
[1:17:44] They That's not being the man.
[1:17:47] Jesus Christ said, "And be you kind
[1:17:51] one to another."
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Marriages don't work
[1:17:57] out. Relationships don't work because we
[1:18:00] forget to be what?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Kind one to another. And be what?
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Tenderarted.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Tenderhearted.
[1:18:10] Now, this is marriage counseling.
[1:18:15] Be tenderhearted.
[1:18:18] Amen.
[1:18:20] You can hear some positive, some mighty
[1:18:24] or psychology
[1:18:26] and dogmatic,
[1:18:28] but who's telling you to be kind and be
[1:18:31] tenderhearted one to another? Are you
[1:18:34] with me?
[1:18:37] Be sweet, be loving,
[1:18:40] be gentle. Are you with me,
[1:18:45] honey? I really appreciate this meal.
[1:18:49] It's nice. Amen. And thank you for doing
[1:18:52] it. Be nice. Be kind. Be tenderhearted.
[1:18:58] Are you with me?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Really love you. I want you to know
[1:19:02] that.
[1:19:03] I want you to know I love you and I
[1:19:05] appreciate you. Are you with me,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; mama? I love you.
[1:19:11] Appreciate you, daddy. I love you.
[1:19:14] appreciate you.
[1:19:17] Sometimes we forget to tell that you we
[1:19:21] appreciate everything you do.
[1:19:25] I appreciate
[1:19:27] your labor.
[1:19:29] I like to tell y'all I appreciate y'all
[1:19:31] labor love this year. You know your
[1:19:34] faithfulness. Amen. Appreciate it. Amen.
[1:19:37] I got to get off of this verse. Forgiven
[1:19:40] what?
[1:19:44] Your healing and your victory is in your
[1:19:46] forgiveness.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; If you can't forgive, you can't get
[1:19:50] healed.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And you wonder why you struggle with
[1:19:54] things. You got to be able to forgive.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I find out I, you know, I walked in the
[1:20:02] room. I I tell y'all that all the time.
[1:20:04] But I tell you, uh
[1:20:07] prayed for us. I was preaching on
[1:20:09] forgiveness down in Florida and big
[1:20:11] church. People had about 300 people.
[1:20:14] Lady had she was suffering migraines,
[1:20:16] headaches for years.
[1:20:19] And it was just nothing she could do to
[1:20:21] get rid of them. And I preached on
[1:20:23] forgiveness. Had to to do with your
[1:20:26] healing.
[1:20:28] She saw me at the camp meeting years
[1:20:29] later and she says, "I was one of the
[1:20:31] ones that's sitting in the audience when
[1:20:33] you preached that forgiveness. I forgave
[1:20:36] and I was healed that night."
[1:20:41] Next door naval, she was in intensive
[1:20:44] care and everybody almost gave up.
[1:20:48] I told her got there she had some tra I
[1:20:52] mean thing in her mouth and all and I
[1:20:55] told her
[1:20:57] if that's something that you hold in
[1:20:59] your heart and you hadn't forgiven
[1:21:01] somebody
[1:21:03] and the tears start rolling out her
[1:21:04] eyes.
[1:21:06] I said forgive
[1:21:09] now if you want to be healed forgive.
[1:21:13] And those tears rolled.
[1:21:16] A couple days later, she was out the
[1:21:18] hospital, not out intensive care. She
[1:21:20] was at the hospital
[1:21:24] because she forgave.
[1:21:28] I've had people
[1:21:31] that wanted to have a child or wanted
[1:21:32] this, that, and they had to forgive
[1:21:35] before they can have a child. Things
[1:21:38] that block you, stop you from having a
[1:21:42] victorious life, and that's
[1:21:44] unforgiveness. Yeah.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; And so you know a lot of people
[1:21:49] um so a half of the times and about 75%
[1:21:54] of the time people
[1:21:57] haven't told the person
[1:22:01] that they have injured them in some way.
[1:22:06] They they never went to the brother or
[1:22:08] sister and and signify it. It it affects
[1:22:12] them more than it affects the other
[1:22:14] people. People leave the church, they
[1:22:16] get offended by me, but they'll leave
[1:22:18] the church and you could ask them, "Did
[1:22:20] you do anything? Did I do anything to
[1:22:22] you?" They said, "No, you ain't done a
[1:22:23] thing."
[1:22:26] But they leave and they are offended.
[1:22:30] They see you said something or you did
[1:22:32] this. You know, I wouldn't know
[1:22:36] you when you said if I did something, I
[1:22:39] want I want you to forgive me. I I I
[1:22:41] want to get it right and I want you to
[1:22:43] leave right. People walk, they won't get
[1:22:47] it right. They'll leave wrong
[1:22:51] and won't get it right. Do you know what
[1:22:52] happens when they get to the next
[1:22:55] destination? They're going to do the
[1:22:56] same thing
[1:22:58] because that spirit,
[1:23:02] the unforgiveness
[1:23:06] of whatever it was,
[1:23:08] you keep moving under the same
[1:23:11] anointing.
[1:23:12] But forgiveness is the secret.
[1:23:16] We take this communion
[1:23:18] tonight.
[1:23:21] We can't hold grudges
[1:23:23] something in our heart against anybody.
[1:23:27] The reason why we ought to forgive one
[1:23:29] another even as God for what
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; has forgiven us.
[1:23:36] Are you with me?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; We weren't so good either. So why should
[1:23:42] we hold a grudge on somebody else?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If Christ could forgive us, we
[1:23:48] ought to be able to what?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Forgive one another. Will you do that?
[1:23:55] And watch the church grow.
[1:23:58] And you said, "Well, uh, the you want
[1:24:00] all the seats to be filled." I would
[1:24:02] like that, but I want you to grow in
[1:24:05] love.
[1:24:06] Praise God. That means more than every
[1:24:08] seat being filled. When the love of God
[1:24:11] is just, you know, filled in every heart
[1:24:14] and there's no grudges, there's no
[1:24:16] bitterness. There's no indifference, but
[1:24:19] everybody just love one another. Are you
[1:24:22] with me?
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And when you have a church like that,
[1:24:26] it's a beautiful group of people. Amen.
[1:24:30] The devil can't get in in there. Amen.
[1:24:33] Because it's just full of love. Amen.
[1:24:36] Somebody do something wrong or say
[1:24:38] something wrong, you forgive them. Oh,
[1:24:41] they ain't mean that. Are you with me?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; But if you can hold hold on to it and
[1:24:47] say it mean that I don't. Uh-uh. Don't
[1:24:50] do that. Forgive. And if you done
[1:24:53] something and you know you done
[1:24:55] something to offend somebody, just ask
[1:24:58] them, "Please forgive me." Are you Is
[1:25:00] that hard
[1:25:02] to ask them, "Please forgive me. I
[1:25:04] didn't mean to do it.
[1:25:07] Even though they might think you meant
[1:25:09] to do it, you tell them, I did not mean
[1:25:11] to do it. If it it offend you, I didn't
[1:25:15] mean to hurt you. So many people I've
[1:25:18] told, I didn't mean to hurt you. I I ask
[1:25:21] you to forgive me. You know what I'm
[1:25:23] saying? Sometimes things come across the
[1:25:25] pull pit, it's not intended to hurt, but
[1:25:28] by the time it get to you, the devil can
[1:25:30] twist it. twist it that way, twist it
[1:25:33] this way. And then you think, you know,
[1:25:36] I did he said that he talking about me,
[1:25:40] you know, but it it wasn't intended to
[1:25:43] be that way. You see what I'm saying?
[1:25:45] And sometimes
[1:25:47] you can misunderstand one another. And
[1:25:50] when you're misunderstanding one
[1:25:52] another,
[1:25:54] then talk it over. Please. Please. The
[1:25:58] hour was late. Time is winding up.
[1:26:02] And you can easily misunderstand one
[1:26:04] another. Okay?
[1:26:07] Be ye kind
[1:26:10] one to another,
[1:26:12] tenderhearted.
[1:26:14] Amen.
