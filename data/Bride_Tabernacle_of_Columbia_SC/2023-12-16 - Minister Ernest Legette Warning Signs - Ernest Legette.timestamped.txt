[34:07] 7 Amos 3 and
[34:09] 7 we got it say
[34:12] amen and it
[34:14] reads well it's I want to start first
[34:17] verse Amos 3 and
[34:20] one hear hear this the word that the
[34:23] Lord has spoken against you oh children
[34:26] of Israel
[34:27] against the whole family which I have
[34:29] brought up out of the land of Egypt
[34:30] saying you only have I known of all the
[34:33] families of the earth therefore I will
[34:36] punish you for all your iniquities can
[34:39] two walk together except they be agreed
[34:42] when a lion roar in the forest when he
[34:45] have will a lion roar in the forest when
[34:48] he have no prey will a young lion cry
[34:50] out of his den if he have taken nothing
[34:54] can a bird fall in a snare upon upon the
[34:57] Earth where no genin is for him shall
[35:00] one take up a snare from the earth and
[35:03] have taken Nothing At All Shall the
[35:05] trumpet be blown in the city and the
[35:07] people not be afraid shall there be evil
[35:11] in the city and the Lord have not done
[35:13] it surely the Lord God would do nothing
[35:16] but he revealed his Secrets unto his
[35:18] servants the prophets the lying the lion
[35:21] ha roared who will not fear the lord ha
[35:25] spoken who shall not but prophesy may
[35:28] God is the Blessed you reading of his
[35:30] word tonight by the grace of God we just
[35:34] want to minister on warning signs amen
[35:37] this a little something that the Lord
[35:38] put on our heart you know and I I said
[35:41] you know what is a warning sign you know
[35:43] a warning sign is is something you know
[35:45] that lets you know that danger is ahead
[35:48] or it gets your attention to prepare for
[35:50] something that's up that's upcoming so
[35:52] we want to talk about warning signs you
[35:55] know I was thinking about you know it's
[35:57] a lot of things in this life that that
[36:00] give off warning signs but you know it's
[36:03] up to that individual to take heed to
[36:05] the warning right was thinking about you
[36:08] know how we go through these baller
[36:10] schools and and stuff at work and how
[36:12] they sent us to the baller school and
[36:15] and uh you know they it it they tell you
[36:18] to see the warning signs they tell you
[36:21] to to be able to uh train you to be able
[36:23] to look at stuff that even the the
[36:25] digital gauges might not pick up you
[36:28] know certain sounds certain things and
[36:30] and then certain visual things you might
[36:32] see so far as like in the sight glass
[36:35] that's the number one thing if you don't
[36:37] see water in the sight glass they said
[36:39] don't even think about it just run they
[36:42] got eops by every door hit the East stop
[36:44] and run fast as you can so and you know
[36:47] you learn to to take heed to those
[36:49] warning signs cuz if you don't you're
[36:52] taking a big risk or a gamble with your
[36:55] life because you didn't heed the warning
[36:58] signs but the warning signs that God
[37:00] give out is more than just taking a
[37:02] gamble with your life it's taking a
[37:05] gamble with your soul and that's one
[37:07] thing we don't want to take a gamble
[37:09] with because in that place you'll never
[37:13] you can't get that back when you take
[37:14] that gamble right so you know we want to
[37:17] talk about warning signs I like how you
[37:20] know Amos here prophesying and he was
[37:21] saying you know out of you have I you
[37:24] have I known out of all the families of
[37:26] the Earth you know I thought about that
[37:28] and he's saying you know so I'm going to
[37:30] punish you but the reason why God loved
[37:32] him so much and his love you know
[37:35] stretched out towards them and he just
[37:37] couldn't stand to see them disobey his
[37:39] word or disobey his will right and he
[37:43] was beginning to say you know I brought
[37:44] you up out of Egypt out of all the
[37:46] families have you have I known out of
[37:49] all the families of the earth God did
[37:52] extra extra for those and took away
[37:54] Vineyards and cities and all that they
[37:56] didn't build and Vineyards they didn't
[37:58] plant and all and gave it to them not
[38:00] because of they were like he said the
[38:02] greatest because you were the smallest
[38:03] not because you this it was only because
[38:06] God chose to elect he elected them he
[38:08] chose them to be his people so it was
[38:11] only by his grace and that's why you
[38:13] know he couldn't stand to see them you
[38:15] know uh uh do certain things but you
[38:18] know one of the things that that you
[38:20] know Amos was saying here he saying you
[38:22] know can two walk together except they
[38:24] they be agreed you know and many of
[38:26] times we don't want to we don't want to
[38:28] um think about that and that's that's
[38:30] coming with your family your friends no
[38:33] matter who it is to can't walk together
[38:35] except they be in agreement you know and
[38:39] sometimes we we think that you know uh
[38:42] this scripture might not apply in this
[38:44] situation that situation but one
[38:46] somebody going to
[38:48] compromise somebody you know I was
[38:50] ministering one time on on uh two
[38:52] masters you can't serve two masters the
[38:55] Bible says you going to love one you
[38:56] going to hate the other right so you
[38:59] can't it's no uh middle of the road in
[39:01] that aspect but you got to make it up in
[39:04] your mind who you going to serve you
[39:07] know whether you going to serve the Lord
[39:10] you don't serve the Lord ain't but one
[39:11] other one other place ain't it one other
[39:13] to be a servant of right sin but I want
[39:16] to say make up in your mind tonight you
[39:18] know who you want to serve come on
[39:20] because I I don't know about you but
[39:22] it's in my heart to serve the Lord you
[39:25] know I said God I pray all the time I
[39:28] said Lord you brought us this far you
[39:30] didn't bring us this far to leave us you
[39:32] didn't call us uh way back at that time
[39:35] and and brought us through all that
[39:37] we've been through to leave us out here
[39:39] I don't believe that but the devil put
[39:41] things in your mind sometimes to to have
[39:44] you because what it is in your Christian
[39:47] Journey your fire done been dying out
[39:49] done getting cold and lukewarm or you
[39:51] don't come to a place the way you
[39:53] relaxed and then you feel as though at
[39:56] that because everything is easy right
[39:59] but that's why God comes to stir up the
[40:01] the the nest stir up the pot sometimes
[40:04] to to see what you going to do he
[40:06] already know what you going to do but I
[40:08] says God you know in all those things we
[40:12] you know at this hour that we live in
[40:14] it's not an hour like we always say of
[40:16] relaxation we can cry that scream that
[40:19] pray that holler that out you know but
[40:21] it's got to take something it's got to
[40:23] take something within you or or letting
[40:26] you know that hey you need to check up
[40:28] your soul salvation you need to make
[40:29] your calling election sure because
[40:32] things are right here on the edge the
[40:34] whole world knows that y we know that
[40:37] tonight the whole world knows that the
[40:39] Nations know that everybody as I was
[40:42] saying the other night I was talking to
[40:43] brother Simmons who was saying uh how
[40:45] they putting all the pressure on uh uh
[40:47] uh uh Biden now to to try to and then
[40:50] him and uh uh Nan now they had little
[40:53] tensions because they want them to to
[40:55] tell Israel to stop they want them to
[40:56] quit backing those all you know and
[40:58] everybody want to come against them what
[40:59] is it we at the right now the at the
[41:01] break of Nations breaking up right the
[41:04] UN breaking up everybody going their own
[41:06] ways because they choosing sides right
[41:09] but I say is that the only side we can
[41:11] choose tonight that I know that's going
[41:12] to be a sure Foundation is with the word
[41:15] hallelujah is with God that's the only
[41:17] you know that's the only safe place I
[41:20] know I was telling somebody my testimony
[41:23] today of of of the Lord and how that's
[41:26] the only safe place I know that's the
[41:29] only place that I found rest at when
[41:32] when I was in a a a rut in a mess and I
[41:35] and I was in a bad place that's the only
[41:38] place that I found rest at I found it
[41:41] when I got down on my knees and I cried
[41:43] out to God and I asked God to help me
[41:45] you know when everything else is around
[41:47] you but I had to get away from all the
[41:49] noise all the other noise and all the
[41:52] other things had to get away from them
[41:54] and get along with God and hear his
[41:57] voice and he he's got a voice and he's
[42:00] still speaking but but it's so many
[42:02] other voices it's so much other noise
[42:05] out there that it's hard to hear God's
[42:07] voice in this hour it's hard to hear him
[42:10] calling many times I was I saying the
[42:12] other day to the church I I says that
[42:14] the preacher ain't picking at you I says
[42:17] you've been asking God to help you deal
[42:18] with that situation or give you the
[42:20] answer and the man of God come he
[42:22] delivered the word preach the word but
[42:24] it ain't the answer that you was looking
[42:25] for
[42:28] it wasn't what the way you thought it
[42:29] was going to be but then you just took
[42:31] it and throw it off or whatever but what
[42:33] it was you couldn't hear the voice of
[42:35] God because your own voice your your own
[42:39] thoughts and ideas was clouding out the
[42:41] voice of God so when it came you said it
[42:43] ain't that ain't God's voice but God's
[42:45] voice a lot of time goes against the
[42:47] grain doesn't it Jesus when he was
[42:50] praying he says Lord if it be possible
[42:53] let this cup pass but not my will let
[42:55] thy will be done
[42:56] and what was his will saying he said
[42:58] Lord I come in the volume of the book is
[43:00] written to me to do thy
[43:02] will in the midst of all what is going
[43:05] it's written of me to do your will this
[43:07] is a hard road ahead of me this is you
[43:10] know the road that we got ahead I don't
[43:12] believe it's no light Road I believe we
[43:14] see the warning signs of Destruction
[43:16] ahead I see we see the but even in that
[43:19] we going to look up why because we know
[43:21] that our Redemption is drawing nigh we
[43:23] see the warning sign so what are we
[43:25] doing we look for the sign of his coming
[43:28] hallelujah oh Jesus but we find I says I
[43:32] says the warning sign many times we
[43:34] don't heed it but God always sends
[43:36] warning before judgment you know a lot
[43:39] of times you know the prophet of God is
[43:41] bringing out people that left here they
[43:43] say oh they didn't know nobody knew they
[43:45] didn't have a warning or they had a
[43:48] warning he saying that you know
[43:50] everybody left here at some form or
[43:52] fashion or way God let them know to get
[43:54] your house in order just as he told
[43:57] Hezekiah he'll say get your house in
[43:59] order cuz you're going to die in some
[44:01] form of fashion now whether that person
[44:04] heed the warning or
[44:05] not that's going to be between them go
[44:09] and God but it was more than just
[44:11] strange happenings or coincidences
[44:14] because it is not so with God God has
[44:17] all of our steps uh planned all of our
[44:20] days all that those those things
[44:22] numbered things catch us by surprise but
[44:25] they don't catch God by surprise so what
[44:28] it is that's why we cry Lord I might not
[44:31] know what's up the road tomorrow but I
[44:32] know you know so I'm asking you to keep
[44:35] me in your will I'm asking you that when
[44:38] tomorrow if I wake up tomorrow by your
[44:41] grace Lord whatever my ambitions I might
[44:43] have plans for tomorrow but whatever is
[44:46] coming tomorrow though my plans if
[44:48] they're not in your will I don't want
[44:50] those plans but God when I wake up in
[44:52] the morning let my mind be in say lord
[44:55] it's written me to do your will I want
[44:57] your will how many want to do the will
[44:59] of God tonight now God's will is going
[45:02] to go against your
[45:03] will it's going to go against what you
[45:06] want your ideas and what you thought
[45:08] about it some people got their whole
[45:10] lives planned out I had mine planned out
[45:12] at one time but you still make plans but
[45:15] the thing is you learn the the the as
[45:18] time go on to yield to God yield to his
[45:22] will I never would have saw myself doing
[45:24] what I'm doing now where I'm at right
[45:26] now never would have saw myself even
[45:28] ministering the gospel and that's you
[45:29] know God was dealing with your life but
[45:31] you couldn't see what was up the road
[45:34] but God already saw it only thing you
[45:36] learned to do was yield to God's will
[45:39] only thing you learned to do was put
[45:41] aside what you want to do your own
[45:43] pleasure and say Lord I want to do your
[45:45] will that's what you learn to do
[45:48] Hallelujah but I said surely you know uh
[45:51] h a God he gives us warning signs but
[45:54] many of times you know uh people don't
[45:56] want to accept don't want to accept the
[45:59] the warning signs that God it's all we
[46:01] can look all through the scriptures now
[46:02] we know that you know as many angles we
[46:04] could take it from but God always gave
[46:07] out warning signs things didn't just
[46:09] happen before any major happening
[46:11] happened on the earth we know that God
[46:13] will send a prophet the world don't want
[46:15] to believe that today why because
[46:17] everybody want to look at themselves and
[46:19] say he ain't no better than me I'm the
[46:20] one but it ain't that it's just the it's
[46:22] just the gift that God or the position
[46:24] that God called a man to no God don't
[46:26] got no respect to persons but he still
[46:28] got order he still got ways that he does
[46:31] things and whether the world don't want
[46:33] to look at it that way or receive it or
[46:36] not nevertheless that ain't going to
[46:38] stop the program of God hallelujah God
[46:42] Still's got a way of doing things you
[46:44] know in the in the days of uh of Noah
[46:48] you know that Ark was a true sign
[46:50] Overlook wasn't it it was a warning sign
[46:53] Noah was a warning sign in his
[46:54] generation it looked L crazy looked like
[46:56] it was was was out of out of the
[46:59] ordinary and that's what it was God does
[47:02] things out of the ordinary doesn't he he
[47:05] does that's how he does it out of the
[47:07] ordinary so why today we allow the devil
[47:10] to trick our minds to to look for the
[47:12] ordinary
[47:13] things we looking for the ordinary
[47:15] things we trying to figure out even when
[47:17] we hear certain things we try to figure
[47:19] out well how could that be how could
[47:20] that be because we're looking for some
[47:23] explanation to see how could that have
[47:25] happened
[47:26] but that's not how God operates God
[47:29] doesn't operate from that aspect but how
[47:31] does God operate God operates in the
[47:35] Supernatural he operates in the things
[47:37] that can't be explained he operates in
[47:40] the things that man don't have no
[47:43] understanding no knowledge of and that's
[47:45] what baffles the medical field that's
[47:47] what baffles the scientific field that's
[47:50] why many people can't believe it because
[47:52] they ain't have no e explanation for it
[47:54] they can't understand it
[47:56] but I don't know about you but God has
[47:57] done so much for me that was unexplained
[48:01] till I come to the point that I say I
[48:03] don't have to know how or be explained
[48:05] Lord I believe it and I'm I'm just
[48:08] resting on what you said you done enough
[48:11] already that all I got to do Lord I
[48:13] believe what you said you did enough
[48:15] already come on I said as he done enough
[48:17] for you already come on I was sharing uh
[48:20] like I said my testimony today and the
[48:23] guy kept cutting me off he kept saying
[48:25] oh oh he said Ernest that's a testimony
[48:28] Ernest the Lord been good to you and I
[48:30] said the thing about it is that's all
[48:32] it's been my whole life whole life's
[48:35] testimony is that God has been good to
[48:38] me you know I always like that little
[48:40] song of uh uh that brother Gordon sings
[48:43] it
[48:44] sometime it slipped my mind just now but
[48:47] he sings it sometime I guess I'm getting
[48:48] a little old but uh so glad I'm Yours
[48:52] Lord that's the song so glad I'm Yours
[48:55] Lord Lord so glad you found me and you
[48:58] set me free so glad that I'm Yours Lord
[49:02] come on not that he's mine but I belong
[49:04] to him Hallelujah but God God that's
[49:08] what he does he sends warning signs we
[49:10] know that Noah I'm trying to go along
[49:13] but we know that Noah was a warning sign
[49:16] many people walked right past that
[49:17] warning sign wasn't didn't they you know
[49:19] Moses you know he was a warning sign
[49:22] even in his generation but just as Noah
[49:25] was building the ark Noah couldn't do
[49:28] even though God the sign was there you
[49:30] couldn't still do what you want to do
[49:32] even though the the flood was coming you
[49:34] could have prepared for it any kind of
[49:36] way maybe they did I don't know you
[49:38] could have prepared for it in any kind
[49:40] of way but it was going only be one way
[49:42] that was going to withstand the
[49:44] flood it was going to only be one thing
[49:46] that was going to withstand the flood
[49:48] and that was the ark that Noah built and
[49:51] Noah didn't build that Ark under his own
[49:54] wisdom and guidance
[49:56] but it was under the instructions of
[49:58] almighty God and that was going to be
[50:01] the only thing that was going to
[50:02] withstand the Judgment that was coming
[50:04] on the earth come on God he ain't going
[50:08] to leave you now without a way of Escape
[50:11] that's what I like about God cuz even
[50:13] though the things is coming he still
[50:14] gives us a way of escape a way for you
[50:17] to get out of it a way for you to run
[50:21] for your life I like how in one place in
[50:23] the church AG he was talking about
[50:25] Escape ones I like how God always even
[50:28] though the darkest AG came he always
[50:30] give the people a way of
[50:32] Escape Hallelujah when the devil got
[50:36] hold on your life God give you a way of
[50:38] Escape Hallelujah God give you an Avenue
[50:41] to get out of there and run for your
[50:44] life aren't you glad that God gave you a
[50:46] way of Escape come on and how was it it
[50:50] was through the shed blood of what he
[50:51] done for you on Calvary you don't have
[50:53] to go to hell tonight you don't have to
[50:56] be bound by sin and out there and live
[50:58] that life you don't have to why because
[51:01] he paid the price that you and I can be
[51:04] free tonight a way of Escape is what he
[51:07] made for me Hallelujah and I want to
[51:09] choose that way come on oh Jesus come on
[51:14] we ain't bound we free tonight we escape
[51:18] the wrath that is to come we're not as
[51:20] those that don't have no hope people say
[51:23] oh you talking about it's going you
[51:24] ought to be scared no we escaping it why
[51:27] because we're in what the instructions
[51:30] that God has given us I thank God we're
[51:32] able to take heed to those instructions
[51:35] get in the word and stay there and be
[51:37] ready when Jesus come Hallelujah not in
[51:40] the church but in the word so many
[51:43] people in church but you got to get in
[51:45] the word the word got to be in you you
[51:48] and the word got to become one
[51:50] Hallelujah I like how you know the other
[51:52] night brother Simmons was saying
[51:54] something
[51:56] we was talking about the
[51:59] elect and he was saying how the you know
[52:02] that the the you know was reading in
[52:04] studying how many people see the word
[52:08] and they and they they see it and they
[52:10] can know it's the truth but yet they
[52:13] still won't live it yet they'll still
[52:15] reject it come on and I was saying that
[52:19] what it is I said in your heart
[52:23] sometimes you don't want to believe that
[52:25] that people don't see it you want to
[52:27] believe in your heart that they really
[52:29] don't see it but because iniquity is in
[52:33] them because of iniquity they know to do
[52:36] right but they won't do it you know I
[52:38] like the look at that scripture
[52:41] sometimes how Jesus was talking about
[52:44] men love Darkness rather than light
[52:46] because their deeds are evil they know
[52:49] that the light is better for them they
[52:51] know they can draw a a a a a strength
[52:55] from the light they know that things
[52:57] grow in the light they know there's
[52:59] healing in the light but they don't want
[53:03] it why because their deeds are evil and
[53:07] they don't want to give up those evil
[53:08] Deeds do they they don't want to give up
[53:10] that boy friend like we say or that
[53:13] girlfriend or that alcohol or whatever
[53:17] it is they don't want to give it up so
[53:19] they rather stay in darkness cuz if you
[53:21] ain't walking in the light as he is in
[53:23] the light you in dark
[53:26] Hallelujah but nevertheless I say I like
[53:31] on brother s was saying the other night
[53:33] that no the elect what the elect will do
[53:36] no matter how much the word goes against
[53:39] and hurts them no matter how much the
[53:41] word goes against their will and what
[53:44] they want to do and hurts their their
[53:46] flesh they ain't they they going to
[53:48] still yield to the word no matter how
[53:51] much pain they going through they going
[53:52] to yield to it no matter how much
[53:54] suffering they got to go through they'll
[53:56] yield to it why cuz they got no other
[53:59] choice greater is he that's in you and
[54:01] he's drawing on you you can't help but
[54:04] to let go hallelujah it's in your heart
[54:07] and God put it there I believe that come
[54:11] on but sometimes you want to believe
[54:13] that people don't they don't really see
[54:16] it or understand it but they have eyes
[54:19] and still can't see ears and can't hear
[54:23] but he said blessed are y'all eyes
[54:26] because you see and blessed are your
[54:28] ears because you hear you know it's a
[54:31] blessing that you can hear the word of
[54:33] God and become subject to it it's a
[54:37] blessing out of all of your
[54:39] friends sometimes excuse me all of your
[54:43] friends all of your family it's a
[54:47] blessing that you can hear the word and
[54:51] and your desires
[54:53] change Hallelujah
[54:56] you having thinking you're having fun
[54:58] one day you might think you're on top of
[55:00] the world but all of a sudden your
[55:01] desires begin to
[55:04] change you've been hearing the word and
[55:06] things been changing on the inside of
[55:08] your appetite
[55:10] changed people don't understand what's
[55:12] going on with you you don't know what's
[55:14] going on with you but God know what's
[55:17] going on with you God knew you out of
[55:19] you have he known out of all the people
[55:21] in the earth God knew you Hallelujah
[55:25] your desires your appetite begin to
[55:27] change you want to hold back but that it
[55:29] don't do nothing sometime but bring more
[55:31] pain on you it's easier to let go and
[55:34] just say God here it is feed me Lord I'm
[55:38] hungry oh Jesus I'm thirsty give me all
[55:42] that well to
[55:43] drink Hallelujah that I won't thirst no
[55:46] more oh Jesus how many want that well
[55:49] tonight but I thank God I don't know
[55:51] about you but I'm still hungry I'm still
[55:55] he is my satisfying portion but I want
[55:57] God more and more of God every day I
[55:59] want more and more of his Spirit every
[56:01] hour and say I need thee Lord I need
[56:04] thee you know I was singing that little
[56:06] song to
[56:07] myself Lord whatever you're doing in
[56:10] this season don't do it without me
[56:13] warning signs are all around us you know
[56:17] the disciples asked Jesus they said we
[56:20] thought El lias was going to come
[56:23] first he said he it came but you did
[56:26] show to him whatsoever you listed and
[56:29] you didn't know him
[56:30] right they missed the warning sign what
[56:33] was the warning sign he said that one
[56:35] was going to he going to be crying in
[56:37] the wilderness right voice one crying in
[56:40] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[56:42] Lord he came and they even asked him and
[56:44] he told him I'm not the Messiah I'm just
[56:46] the one the voice of one crying in the
[56:48] wilderness the sign came but they
[56:50] overlooked the sign didn't they they
[56:52] didn't want to they didn't want to admit
[56:54] admit that John was a sign the voice
[56:59] they didn't want to admit that what he
[57:00] was speaking was the prophecy they were
[57:03] looking for they didn't want to admit
[57:04] that why because it looked crazy didn't
[57:07] it he looked crazy looked fanatical
[57:10] don't you know I believe that even today
[57:13] signs and wonders happening people ain't

[1:02:51] hard and that flash and red lights of
[1:02:54] his his
[1:02:55] coming the signs of the
[1:02:58] time we know that God has sent a prophet
[1:03:03] in this last day thus said the Lord
[1:03:07] Vindicated the
[1:03:08] word
[1:03:10] yet who is going to believe our report
[1:03:14] as Isaiah
[1:03:15] said and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:03:19] reveal doesn't
[1:03:23] matter if one rise from the dead brother
[1:03:27] Fred he said send louus go back and tell
[1:03:31] our brother he said if you don't hear

[1:03:38] dead if they want to hear those on the
[1:03:40] earth they ain't going to hear
[1:03:43] one brother and sisters I was reading
[1:03:47] this morning for my lesson this morning
[1:03:51] about laders and Jesus Jesus came by lus
[1:03:57] House John 12 and talked about
[1:04:02] lus whom Jesus had raised from the dead
[1:04:05] and he was coming by and having supper
[1:04:08] with him Mary begin to uh have this
[1:04:12] orament and begin to anoint the feet of
[1:04:17] Jesus and it was very precious
[1:04:20] and Judas scariot said you know that's
[1:04:24] cost a lot of money in other
[1:04:26] words and
[1:04:28] you wasting nothing and you got so many
[1:04:31] po
[1:04:33] people and you could have fed a lot of
[1:04:36] FK Po Folks with that all that you
[1:04:42] pouring on his
[1:04:43] feet Jesus said she was doing it because
[1:04:46] of his
[1:04:48] barrier and often
[1:04:51] times amen Judas didn't say it because
[1:04:55] he cared about the
[1:04:57] pole the Bible said that he had he was
[1:05:01] the tragedy he had the
[1:05:03] bag and he was a
[1:05:06] thief
[1:05:09] see sometimes we can see the
[1:05:13] outside but Jesus knew all the time what
[1:05:16] was going on but Jesus didn't care about
[1:05:19] exposing
[1:05:21] him he just uh he said the pole you have
[1:05:26] always but me you not going to have
[1:05:29] always and he tell them about except a
[1:05:32] corn of wheat fall in the ground and die
[1:05:35] it'll AB the
[1:05:37] loone but if it
[1:05:39] die it'll bring forth much
[1:05:42] fruit Jesus knew all the time his owl is
[1:05:48] coming
