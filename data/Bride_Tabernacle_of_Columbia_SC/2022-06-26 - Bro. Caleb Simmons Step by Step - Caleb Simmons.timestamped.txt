[31:47] here in jesus name we pray amen
[31:51] amen if you have your bibles this
[31:53] morning ask that you turn to the book of
[31:56] first peter
[32:00] look of first peter chapter 2.
[32:17] when you got it saved man
[32:24] first peter chapter two we'll start in
[32:26] verse
[32:27] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[32:30] all god
[32:32] and hypocrisies and envies
[32:35] and all evil speaking
[32:37] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[32:39] of the word that you may grow thereby
[32:43] it so be ye have tasted that the lord is
[32:45] gracious
[32:47] to whom coming as unto a a living stone
[32:50] disallowed indeed of man
[32:52] but chosen of god and precious
[32:55] ye also as a lively stoner built up a
[32:58] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[33:00] offer up spiritual sacrifices
[33:03] acceptable to god by jesus christ amen
[33:06] you may be seated
[33:08] amen
[33:09] this morning i'd like to
[33:11] speak on a little thought
[33:13] i entitled i did called step by step
[33:17] step by step
[33:18] and uh the lord was dealing with me
[33:21] through it some different things and i
[33:23] said in life there's always steps that
[33:24] you have to take
[33:26] there's always steps that you go through
[33:28] things that allow you to progress
[33:30] forward and i wrote something down i
[33:32] said with
[33:33] say for example before you can run you
[33:35] gotta walk
[33:37] before you walk you gotta crawl
[33:39] but and
[33:40] at this time in the scripture it says
[33:42] here as newborn babes desire to sincere
[33:45] nickel the word that you may grow
[33:47] thereby amen it has to be a process of
[33:50] maturity it has to be a process where
[33:52] you're taking steps to go somewhere
[33:55] you're going up or you're going down but
[33:56] you're going somewhere you're not
[33:58] staying still amen so you want to be
[34:00] taking steps you don't want to stay a
[34:02] baby for forever you want to grow
[34:04] and and just saying that the lord places
[34:06] on my heart that i got to be taking
[34:08] steps in the right direction
[34:10] you can be taking steps but headed in
[34:12] the wrong direction
[34:14] you could be taking steps and think that
[34:16] you're going up but you're going down it
[34:18] may look good on the outside but it may
[34:20] be rotten on the inside because
[34:22] something always it takes steps to grow
[34:25] when you look at a tree there's there's
[34:27] elements that cause that tree to grow it
[34:29] has to have sun it has to have water and
[34:31] it has to have a source of life
[34:33] it has to have these things to grow so
[34:35] there are steps that it takes even and
[34:37] even with the season cause it to grow
[34:40] the seasons help help the tree to grow
[34:42] and it's a step-by-step process
[34:45] i wrote something down i said don't rush
[34:47] the process
[34:48] many times we try to jump from here jump
[34:50] from there when god taking us through to
[34:53] build character in us
[34:55] they said i heard someone say the one
[34:57] thing that you that you had that you
[34:59] take out of this light that you didn't
[35:01] bring in it was your character
[35:03] and god is using certain things to build
[35:06] character
[35:08] in you i said just like before you go to
[35:10] heaven you have to be you have to repent
[35:13] and then you have to you have to be
[35:14] baptized and then you got to be filled
[35:17] with the holy ghost so there are steps
[35:18] that you got to go through and even
[35:20] though you might not be in in the in the
[35:23] third step you might be in the first
[35:24] step but there's a step that you got to
[35:26] do to come to god there's a step that
[35:29] you got to go through to come to god and
[35:30] he said
[35:31] and he said the only way we're going to
[35:34] make it is step by step because change
[35:36] doesn't happen overnight
[35:38] god can do things in your life to change
[35:40] situations god can do things in your
[35:42] life to work it out but god has a way
[35:45] that you got to come you can't come any
[35:47] way that you decide to come but he said
[35:49] straight is the way
[35:51] the straight is the gate and narrow is
[35:53] the way amen
[35:55] because god is trying to prove something
[35:57] to you it said you can you can be taking
[35:59] steps but going in the wrong direction
[36:02] direction i want to ask you the question
[36:04] this morning are you headed in the right
[36:06] direction
[36:07] are you headed in the right direction i
[36:10] think of some stories in the bible and
[36:11] you can look at it but jonah
[36:14] god told him to go to nineveh
[36:16] but jonah decided i'm gonna go my own
[36:18] way
[36:19] now he ended up in nineveh anyways but
[36:22] he went his own way and he had to suffer
[36:24] for it he had to go through some trials
[36:26] and tribulations because he had to
[36:29] suffer for going his own way
[36:31] so you got to choose which way you want
[36:33] to go
[36:34] you got to choose whether you want to go
[36:36] through hardships and headaches and
[36:37] heartaches instead of just listening to
[36:40] god when he calling calling you and on
[36:42] your life you got to say lord i want i
[36:45] want to go do this thing but you know
[36:47] every decision that you make has
[36:48] consequences
[36:50] every decision step that you make is
[36:52] going to take you in a in a direction
[36:54] whether it's up or whether it's down so
[36:57] you take a step if i step from the
[36:58] ground up to here i moved
[37:01] if i come down and i step down i moved
[37:03] that means that something happened
[37:05] something transpired it happened within
[37:08] me i had to take a step
[37:10] i moved to my right i moved to my left
[37:12] at something i wasn't standing still and
[37:15] you're never standing still even when
[37:17] you think you're standing still you're
[37:19] never standing still even when you think
[37:21] i'm solid
[37:22] god has a way of always moving you
[37:24] because he expects growth he said i
[37:27] wouldn't you be hot or cold because if
[37:28] you're lukewarm i swear you out of my
[37:30] mouth so god wants you to be something
[37:33] he wants you to be doing something he
[37:35] wants you to be moving he wants you
[37:37] something to be transpiring within you
[37:39] see jonah he decided i'm going to do my
[37:41] own thing
[37:43] he said i'm going to get on this ship
[37:44] and i'm going to go far away from where
[37:46] god see
[37:47] i'm going to go far away but he got on
[37:49] that ship
[37:50] and stormed and a storm came up
[37:53] and the people on the ship they
[37:54] recognized this ain't no normal storm
[37:57] this ain't no normal thing that we we
[37:59] don't been through storms before we
[38:01] season stay sailors this not no normal
[38:03] storm
[38:04] he they said something something
[38:06] something wrong on this ship
[38:08] something something ain't right over
[38:09] here i got to check we got to check out
[38:11] and see who this is
[38:13] we got to check out and see what's wrong
[38:15] because
[38:16] this group of people that i'm with
[38:18] something wrong here i haven't been
[38:19] through storms before but some somebody
[38:22] here ain't supposed to be here
[38:24] somebody in this group that ain't
[38:25] supposed to be in this group so we gotta
[38:28] find out who it is
[38:29] so they cast lots on that ship and they
[38:32] said and they looked at it and the cash
[38:34] locks and it came up and they said it
[38:35] was jonah now jonah was sleeping and
[38:37] they said well you know we don't want to
[38:39] blame nobody so we going to lighten this
[38:42] and see if we can make it
[38:44] we don't want to point no fingers yet we
[38:46] want to lighten the ship
[38:48] but after lightening the ship it didn't
[38:49] help
[38:50] after unloading all these burdens it
[38:52] didn't help they lost all the cargo it
[38:54] didn't help so they said we got to go
[38:56] approach this person and say
[38:59] and jonah said it's me he recognized
[39:02] that god was trying to get his attention
[39:04] he recognized that something it's me
[39:07] it's not them it's me and he focused on
[39:09] it he said well y'all throw me overboard
[39:11] i'll be all right
[39:13] and they threw him overboard and then
[39:14] god sent a big fish to take him but in
[39:17] that fish body he got down there and he
[39:19] got on his knees and he got to praying
[39:22] he got down and he said lord i need i
[39:24] need to step in the right direction
[39:26] i need to take a step in the right
[39:28] direction lord because i'm supposed to
[39:30] be in a different place you sent me
[39:32] somewhere now i got to go by your way
[39:35] when i could have just went by my own
[39:36] choice but god took him through trials
[39:38] and tribulations to get him where he
[39:40] wanted to be and saying that you don't
[39:42] have to go through the trials and
[39:43] tribulations you can just choose the
[39:45] right direction
[39:47] you can take steps in the right path and
[39:49] god can place you and take you further
[39:51] than you ever thought you want to go
[39:53] i said if you look in the book of acts
[39:55] chapter eight
[39:58] here acts chapter eight
[40:00] and there's there's a person another
[40:02] person in the bible that you can look at
[40:04] and his name was saul
[40:07] later he became paul but saul is where i
[40:10] want to talk about it and saul was a
[40:12] very learned man
[40:14] he was well taught he learned under the
[40:16] best of the best a brilliant person
[40:19] and and in
[40:22] acts chapter 8 verse 1.
[40:25] and it says saul he was here
[40:28] and he says and saul was consenting unto
[40:31] his death
[40:32] and at that time there was a great
[40:33] persecution against the church
[40:36] which was at jerusalem and they were all
[40:38] scattered abroad throughout the region
[40:41] regions of judea and samaria
[40:43] except the apostles and devout men
[40:46] carried stephen to his burial and made
[40:48] great lamentation
[40:50] as for saul he make havoc
[40:52] of the church entering into every house
[40:55] and hailing men and women committing
[40:56] them to prison she saw at this point of
[40:59] time he thought he was doing god's will
[41:02] he thought he was headed in the right
[41:04] direction
[41:05] he thought i'm i'm going up i'm doing
[41:07] what i'm supposed to do because these
[41:08] people aren't right
[41:10] they're not living by the laws that we
[41:12] say they got this different doctrine
[41:14] but then if you skip over the chapter 9
[41:18] and in chapter 9 verse 1 and it says in
[41:21] saul yet breathing out threatenings and
[41:23] slaughter against the disciples of the
[41:25] lord went unto the high priest and
[41:27] desired of him letters to damascus to
[41:30] the synagogue that if he found of any of
[41:32] this way whether there were men or women
[41:35] he might bring them bound into jerusalem
[41:38] and as he turned he came near damascus
[41:40] and suddenly to shine round about him a
[41:43] light from heaven and he fell to the
[41:45] earth and heard a voice saying unto him
[41:47] saul saul why persecutest thou me
[41:51] see i asked the question back to you are
[41:53] you heading in the right direction
[41:55] because paul thought he was when he was
[41:57] persecuting the christians he listened
[41:59] to those that was around him and said
[42:00] this is what you need to do but are you
[42:02] listening to god are you listening to
[42:04] the folks around you and say this is the
[42:06] way we should do it or god is trying to
[42:08] lead you in another direction a god is
[42:11] trying to take you on another path
[42:12] that's going to lead you higher that's
[42:14] going to lead you to growth that's going
[42:16] to lead you to blessings or you're
[42:17] trying to go your own way see saul
[42:20] thought he said i'm doing right but god
[42:22] said here in verse 4 he said saul saul
[42:25] why persecute it's not me
[42:27] see he was persecuting the ones that god
[42:29] loved the ones that he had or named and
[42:32] he said in verse 5 and who out thou lord
[42:34] and the lord said i am jesus whom not
[42:37] persecuted it is hard for thee to kick
[42:39] against the pricks see saul didn't have
[42:42] to wonder who it was that was calling
[42:44] his name
[42:45] he knew who it was he i'm sure he may
[42:48] have heard this before but he said lord
[42:51] who out there lord he said i am jesus
[42:54] whom thou persecuted it is hard for thee
[42:56] to kick kick and print against the prick
[42:58] and he trembling and astonish said lord
[43:01] what would thou have me to do and the
[43:03] lord said unto him arise and go into the
[43:06] city and it shall be told thee what thou
[43:09] thou must do she saw he realized that he
[43:12] needed to take steps
[43:14] he needed to take some steps in the
[43:16] right direction he needed to change the
[43:18] path that he was going so that he can
[43:20] honor god so
[43:22] and i said before you go to hell you
[43:24] must take steps to go there
[43:27] before you get to the to the steps of
[43:29] heaven you have to take steps to go
[43:31] there you have to bash bypass all god's
[43:34] ways of salvation
[43:36] all the time that god was knocking on
[43:37] your door to get your attention you got
[43:39] to bypass that and say i don't want it
[43:42] see god it's not going to when you get
[43:44] to heaven it's not going to be this
[43:46] judgment it said you're going to judge
[43:47] yourself
[43:48] you're going to look at because there
[43:50] are going to be many opportunities that
[43:52] god placed in your life and gave you
[43:54] chances to get right
[43:56] many opportunities he asked you to take
[43:58] a step in the right direction he asked
[44:00] you to take the step towards me and he
[44:03] would give you rest he'd make you
[44:05] make your burdens light amen but he said
[44:09] that before you go to hell you must take
[44:11] steps
[44:12] to go there you must reject god's word
[44:15] and his path for salvation just think of
[44:17] luke 18 where there was the young rich
[44:20] ruler he took steps he thought he was
[44:22] successful he had money he was a ruler
[44:25] he was a powerful person maybe he
[44:28] thought i could get this money to maybe
[44:29] help people
[44:31] i can get this status and maybe i can do
[44:33] this for somebody or do this for someone
[44:35] but god said god asked him he said
[44:39] he asked him what have you done he said
[44:41] i've served all the commandments since
[44:42] my youth i think he was a godly person
[44:45] well the lord said you got one thing to
[44:47] sell all you have and give it to the
[44:49] poor
[44:50] and because of all his statuses and
[44:52] things that he thought he was going
[44:54] gonna lose
[44:55] he said i i i
[44:57] i'm good
[44:59] he he took steps in the wrong direction
[45:02] that was a moment for him to take a step
[45:03] in the right direction but he decided
[45:05] that no i'm good i i i
[45:08] i'm i'm stable where i am but he didn't
[45:11] realize that that stable where he was
[45:13] was taking him in the wrong direction he
[45:15] didn't realize that maybe he went
[45:17] further he might have been good up to
[45:18] that point but he might be going
[45:20] downhill after that he didn't know that
[45:23] those steps could be going down instead
[45:25] of he thought they were going up
[45:28] and he says
[45:29] he said that jesus said no man cometh
[45:31] unto the father but by me
[45:33] see god has a way that you have to go
[45:36] god has the way that you can't get under
[45:38] see god has a way that you can't get
[45:40] over and you can't go around it you must
[45:42] come in at the door amen said how are
[45:45] you going to make it to heaven by
[45:47] skipping steps or using your own process
[45:51] how are you going to make it to heaven
[45:52] by skipping steps or using your own
[45:54] process
[45:56] how are you going to make it by doing
[45:58] your own thing
[45:59] how you gonna make it believing that i
[46:01] i'm right and what i say and he won't
[46:03] listen to no one how are you gonna make
[46:05] it how are you gonna make it when you
[46:06] being disobedient how are you gonna make
[46:09] it when you ignoring the advice of
[46:11] people that god doesn't sit in your life
[46:12] to speak to you tell me how you gonna
[46:15] make it when god is using things to
[46:17] speak to you each and every day
[46:19] he using things to get your attention
[46:21] but you ignoring it because you say i
[46:23] don't want to do that right now i'm
[46:24] going to do my life i'm going to do my
[46:26] thing i'm going to live the way that i
[46:28] want to live and then once i get done
[46:30] living i'm going to be able to do i'm
[46:32] going to come back to the lord
[46:35] but what if you ain't got that time
[46:39] i've been going to almost funerals every
[46:41] single week for the last month
[46:43] what if you don't have that time young
[46:45] and old
[46:46] but you decide now i'm gonna take steps
[46:49] well each step is taking you in a
[46:50] direction
[46:51] what direction do you want to go
[46:54] and just because
[46:56] i i wrote something else down just
[46:58] because you are taking all the right
[47:00] steps don't mean that trouble won't come
[47:04] it don't mean that trouble not gonna
[47:06] come in your life sometimes god put
[47:08] trouble to get you closer to speed you
[47:10] up on them steps and sometimes we're
[47:12] taking the steps and we're going slow
[47:14] and god said i need i need to speed you
[47:16] up a little bit so he'll send something
[47:18] in your way to get you i think of the
[47:20] story of job job he did everything right
[47:24] and god still tested him
[47:26] god still tried him took everything from
[47:28] him that he could take except for his
[47:30] life
[47:31] then god and he said just because
[47:34] you may you may be taking all the right
[47:36] steps don't mean that god
[47:38] that god that you won't face it but it
[47:41] does mean that you have confidence that
[47:43] god can bring you through
[47:45] that god can bring you out of all your
[47:47] troubles that you may face in life that
[47:49] god can hold your hand and take you
[47:51] through through all those trials and
[47:53] tribulations
[47:55] because you made the steps in the right
[47:57] direction that don't mean that just
[47:59] because you're making steps that the
[48:00] steps won't be steep
[48:02] that they won't be an uphill climb but
[48:04] he said that i can lead you and i can
[48:06] guide you along the way lord if you walk
[48:10] amen so god can always grab your hand
[48:13] and pull you on through god can always
[48:16] reach now when he know that you're weak
[48:18] you're weary you're wanting and say i'm
[48:20] gonna pick up my child and carry them on
[48:22] through i'm gonna pick them up because i
[48:24] see they trying i see they giving an
[48:27] effort i see that they they working on
[48:29] and they working hard and i see that
[48:30] they've given me their all right and
[48:33] when you meet when you give god 100
[48:36] he can give you some more he can enlarge
[48:38] your vessel to receive more he can make
[48:41] your cup run over sometimes when your
[48:43] cup get full you say i want some more
[48:45] and god can allow your cup to run over
[48:48] because surely goodness and mercy shall
[48:49] follow me all the days of my life and i
[48:52] will dwell in his presence for forever
[48:53] see god can give you more than anything
[48:56] out here
[48:57] anything in the world but you got to be
[49:00] making steps in the right direction you
[49:02] got to be progressing to where god wants
[49:05] you to be not where you want to be
[49:07] because that can be different from where
[49:08] god wants you to be in philippians it
[49:11] says i press towards the my for the
[49:13] prize of the high calling amen so you
[49:15] got to be moving you got to be doing
[49:18] something going in the right direction
[49:20] not the wrong direction and in psalms it
[49:22] says the steps of the good man are
[49:24] ordered by the lord see
[49:27] it's steps that god wants you to take
[49:29] each and every day
[49:31] the prophet of god said to grow closer
[49:33] to him you read your bible and you pray
[49:35] every single day see there's steps that
[49:38] you got to be taking don't get satisfied
[49:40] where you are
[49:42] don't get satisfied and say um even for
[49:45] the one that's not that's not living
[49:47] right in the one that is don't get
[49:49] satisfied with where you are because we
[49:51] all should be growing
[49:53] we all should be taking steps in the
[49:55] right direction we all should be
[49:56] progressing each and every day we all
[49:59] got some room that we need room for
[50:01] improvement we all got room for
[50:03] improvement each and every day ain't
[50:05] none of us in here perfect but god is
[50:07] always worth it and he gave us
[50:09] everything that we needed to make it in
[50:11] so my life may not be your life and my
[50:13] testimony may not be your testimony but
[50:16] it doesn't mean that god ain't done
[50:17] something for me it doesn't mean that
[50:19] god ain't causing me to and pointed me
[50:22] in the right direction that'll mean that
[50:24] god ain't showing me every day that you
[50:26] know yesterday i took a step back but
[50:28] today i'm going to take a step forward
[50:30] doesn't mean that yesterday i didn't
[50:31] stumble and fall but today i can make
[50:34] the right decision to go forward i can
[50:36] make the right decision to step forward
[50:38] i can make the right decision to go on
[50:40] the right path that god has placed in my
[50:42] life see these steps that you're gonna
[50:45] take they gonna be hard sometimes
[50:48] you're gonna have to leave some people
[50:49] along the way you're gonna have to step
[50:51] away from some friends from some family
[50:54] sometimes separate yourself and from
[50:56] from these things that you're going
[50:58] through and these people that's around
[50:59] you because they may not be helping you
[51:01] on your journey
[51:02] they may not be encouraging you on your
[51:04] journey they discouraging you like joel
[51:07] friends they said why don't you just
[51:08] curse your god and die like job wife
[51:10] said curse your god and die but job said
[51:13] no because he's always been there for me
[51:16] he always kept me even in my lowest
[51:18] moment he still kept me even when i was
[51:21] down and out god still kept me and joe
[51:24] continued to make steps in the right
[51:25] direction what happened to job he got
[51:28] double what he lost
[51:30] he got double everything that he lost
[51:32] god
[51:32] restored it tenfold god decided that you
[51:35] know what that's
[51:37] that's a man that always made steps in
[51:39] the right direction no matter what you
[51:41] placed in front of him he still made
[51:43] steps in the right direction no matter
[51:45] what was taken from him he still made
[51:47] steps in the right direction when he
[51:49] lost his his wealth when he lost his
[51:52] family when he lost his friends he still
[51:54] was making steps in the right direction
[51:56] when he was feeble and didn't have much
[51:58] help he still was making steps in the
[52:00] right direction even when he was down
[52:03] and out he still was making steps in the
[52:05] right direction
[52:07] and and he said that the prophet of god
[52:09] said
[52:10] said he he said then i heard something
[52:12] like onward christian soldier
[52:14] i looked here and here come that saintly
[52:16] bunch of of little girls just exactly
[52:19] the way they was all correctly dressed
[52:22] their hair hanging way down on their
[52:24] back smooth clean
[52:26] marching like this
[52:27] the steps
[52:29] of the gospel
[52:30] she was the word they looked like one
[52:33] out of every nation i was looking as it
[52:35] was as they passed by
[52:38] and seeing them pass by instead of going
[52:40] down they were going up
[52:43] and i noticed one of them trying two or
[52:45] three of them trying getting out of line
[52:47] i screamed stay in line
[52:50] and the vision left me and i was
[52:51] standing in the room screaming stay in
[52:53] line
[52:54] and stay in line see that's what god
[52:57] wants you to stay in line and keep
[52:58] marching forward keep marching forward
[53:01] because when you stumble someone
[53:02] stumbles behind you
[53:04] when you stumble and when in those
[53:06] formations in the army when you stumble
[53:08] someone trips over your foot
[53:10] so god wants you to keep pressing
[53:12] forward because someone's always
[53:14] watching
[53:15] someone always paying attention to how
[53:17] you live in your life and if you profess
[53:19] that i i am a christian and then they
[53:21] seek you not living godly then what does
[53:23] that show them
[53:25] what what does that show them which
[53:26] direction are you going
[53:28] it shows them which direction of you you
[53:30] going so one of the best testimonies
[53:32] that you can live is the life that you
[53:34] live
[53:35] people may not see you talk about god
[53:37] they may not see you preach the word to
[53:39] them they may not see you quote
[53:40] scriptures but they are watching your
[53:42] life they watching how you live your
[53:44] life and if you say that i am a
[53:46] christian then they expect certain
[53:47] things from you god expects certain
[53:49] things from you if you say that i
[53:51] believe your word in all of your word
[53:53] then how am i supposed to conduct my
[53:55] life
[53:56] how what steps am i making in the right
[53:58] direction what steps am i doing to show
[54:01] forth that god you are still god you're
[54:03] able to keep me you're able to help me
[54:05] you're able to strengthen me you're able
[54:07] to watch over me and protect me each and
[54:10] every day and so
[54:12] you got to be making steps in the right
[54:14] direction you got to be going forward
[54:16] and allowing god to show forth that i am
[54:19] god through you
[54:21] because sometimes the best the best
[54:22] testimony that you got is the one that
[54:24] you live
[54:25] the one that you live each and every day
[54:28] people may not say that that that's
[54:30] that's the person but they know that
[54:31] you're different
[54:32] they will tell you that you are
[54:34] different they will bypass adding you to
[54:36] certain things by the way that you live
[54:40] they will bypass saying inviting you to
[54:42] certain places because of the way that
[54:44] you live
[54:45] and they don't even know you they could
[54:47] just see you and say i'm gonna skip that
[54:49] person
[54:50] i've had that happen i was sitting in a
[54:52] place one time and people were getting
[54:54] invited to this gathering and i noticed
[54:57] the person behind me got an invite the
[54:59] person in front of me got an invite the
[55:01] person over there got an invite
[55:03] and i felt left out i said how i didn't
[55:06] get one but god knew that i didn't need
[55:08] to be there
[55:09] and they knew that i wasn't a part of it
[55:12] they had never seen the person never
[55:13] knew the person but they knew that god
[55:15] was making sure that i was continuing to
[55:17] make steps in the right direction and
[55:20] just because you feel like you are left
[55:22] out that don't mean that you are left
[55:24] out that may be god protection over your
[55:26] life causing you not to go in the wrong
[55:28] direction that may be god watching over
[55:31] you saying that i'm not going to let you
[55:32] go there cause something might bad might
[55:34] happen there see god always has a way to
[55:37] keep you in line with the steps and
[55:39] where he wants you to go god always has
[55:41] a way in keeping you in line with the
[55:43] direction that he wants you to go so are
[55:45] you following his steps and and keep
[55:48] going in the right direction see when
[55:50] you think that that you are being left
[55:52] out that could be god protection
[55:54] over your life
[55:56] that can be god keeping you away from
[55:58] situations keeping you away from
[56:01] circumstances because he knows that if
[56:03] you get there you're going to do
[56:05] something that you shouldn't do
[56:07] because a lot of times a lot of your
[56:09] influence is by who you are around
[56:12] you wouldn't do certain things if you
[56:13] weren't in certain atmospheres that's
[56:15] why you have the ability to change the
[56:17] atmosphere you have the ability to walk
[56:19] into a place and change it because god
[56:22] knows if he puts you in certain places
[56:24] every man is weak
[56:25] every man will fall because that's our
[56:28] nature we come from a fallen state but
[56:30] only god can keep us
[56:32] only god can keep us going in the right
[56:34] direction only the good hand of the lord
[56:36] can keep us going in the right direction
[56:38] and taking steps in the right direction
[56:41] so you can't rush the process of what
[56:42] god is doing in your life
[56:44] and you got to put your life in the
[56:46] lord's hands and say lord lead me in the
[56:48] right direction lord help me to make the
[56:51] right steps lord help me to grow each
[56:53] and every day to grow stronger because
[56:55] lord i don't want to be a babe all my
[56:57] life i don't want to be a babe just
[56:59] sucking on milk lord i want to eat meat
[57:01] one day lord i want to be able to taste
[57:04] the good things of god not just the
[57:06] little things lord the good things of
[57:08] god i want to sit at the feast of the
[57:10] master's table said lord i want to thank
[57:12] you for helping me make it over lord i
[57:14] want to make the right decisions to step
[57:16] forward and say lord take me on lord
[57:19] continue to let me go up and not down
[57:22] lord i want to step in the right
[57:23] direction because lord you are the one
[57:26] that can keep me going
[57:28] when i'm weak when i'm weary when i'm
[57:30] warned lord you can keep me going you
[57:32] can give me strength lord you can send
[57:35] someone by me to speak to me and my
[57:37] needs lord you can send someone that
[57:39] lord i'm going through but i need
[57:41] something from you lord lord i don't
[57:43] want this opportunity to pass without me
[57:45] taking a step in the right direction
[57:48] each and every day you taking a step
[57:50] each and every morning that you wake up
[57:53] one of my friends he used to tell me he
[57:54] said that every day that i wake up mean
[57:56] that god ain't done with me yet
[57:59] every day that you wake up means that
[58:01] god is not finished with you yet there's
[58:04] something else he wants you to do
[58:05] there's something else that he wants you
[58:07] to accomplish
[58:08] so he gives us opportunity each and
[58:10] every day to come to him to repent to
[58:13] come to him and say lord i'm sorry to
[58:15] come to him and say lord continue
[58:17] creating me a clean heart there's david
[58:20] he went through different things in life
[58:22] but he said lord created me a clean
[58:24] heart because he knew that he wasn't
[58:26] perfect he knew that he wasn't worth it
[58:28] but god still had grace and mercy and
[58:31] even came to the end and said that's a
[58:33] man after my own heart
[58:34] that's a man that even though he
[58:36] stumbled and he fell he always was
[58:39] stepping in the right direction he
[58:41] always was taking a step in the right
[58:43] direction he always was pushing forward
[58:45] even though he may have stumbled and he
[58:47] still he fell he got down on his knees
[58:49] and he repented
[58:51] see god always gives us
[58:53] he always gives us a way of escape
[58:56] he always gives us an opportunity and he
[58:59] put forth the path and steps that we
[59:01] should go in order to make it in because
[59:03] what is the point of living this life to
[59:06] go to hell
[59:07] what is the point of living this life
[59:10] and and to go to the lake of fire
[59:13] what what what are you living for
[59:16] what direction are you going in
[59:18] and
[59:19] action says and then peter said unto
[59:21] them repent and be baptized every one of
[59:23] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[59:25] remission of sins and you shall receive
[59:27] the gift of the holy ghost see that was
[59:29] a step by step process first you have to
[59:32] repent and repent means to be godly
[59:34] sorry it don't mean to get down and and
[59:37] do the same say lord i'm sorry and do
[59:39] the same thing
[59:40] over and over and over again now god
[59:43] said he's willing to forgive you
[59:45] but at some point in time you got to
[59:46] grow
[59:47] you got to start taking steps in the
[59:49] right direction you got to overcome
[59:51] something
[59:52] otherwise you you would continue to go
[59:54] around the same mountain over and over
[59:57] and over just like the children of
[59:58] israel eventually i want to cross over
[1:00:01] to the promised land i don't want to be
[1:00:03] here for forever lord i want to cross
[1:00:05] over and get all your blessings not just
[1:00:07] men are from on heaven i want to go
[1:00:09] where the land is flowing with milk and
[1:00:11] honey where where where where we
[1:00:13] bringing back all the spoils and the
[1:00:15] riches of our enemies because we've
[1:00:17] grown to the point that god can give us
[1:00:19] greater victories
[1:00:20] not just the small things the great
[1:00:22] things in god
[1:00:24] and see
[1:00:25] first you got to repent then you got to
[1:00:27] be baptized
[1:00:28] and then you you want to get to the to a
[1:00:30] point that lord you filled me with your
[1:00:32] with your spirit every single day i can
[1:00:34] hear your voice i can have you walking
[1:00:36] beside me leading and guiding me and
[1:00:38] helping me to take the steps on this
[1:00:40] journey because each and every step i
[1:00:43] need jesus to lift me up each and every
[1:00:46] steps i need the lord to walk with me
[1:00:48] lord each and every day lord walk with
[1:00:50] me lord because i can't take a step
[1:00:52] without you give me the strength to take
[1:00:54] the step i can't go forward unless you
[1:00:57] give me the strength to go forward i
[1:00:58] can't do anything unless you are there
[1:01:01] giving it to me lord jesus see there's
[1:01:03] so many things that we think that we can
[1:01:05] we can do because we may be young we may
[1:01:07] be strong
[1:01:09] but god always has a way of showing us
[1:01:11] that he he is the one that gives you
[1:01:13] strength
[1:01:15] he's the one that that gives you
[1:01:16] strength you can lose your strength
[1:01:18] overnight just get struck with sickness
[1:01:21] you can lose you can lose what you think
[1:01:24] is the thing that makes you strong
[1:01:25] overnight
[1:01:26] god can just take that away from you
[1:01:28] just look at samson god god gave him a
[1:01:31] gift and when he cut his hair well guess
[1:01:33] what he couldn't have that strength no
[1:01:35] more but he spent the rest of his life
[1:01:37] taking steps to go in the right
[1:01:39] direction
[1:01:40] after they plucked out his eyes he
[1:01:42] realized where his strength came from
[1:01:44] he realized that this is not my ability
[1:01:46] this is god that gave me this ability
[1:01:49] and he took the rest of his life he said
[1:01:51] lord and then with my last breath i want
[1:01:54] to give you everything
[1:01:55] you don't have to wait to your last
[1:01:57] breath to decide that you want to give
[1:01:58] god everything
[1:02:00] you can do that way before that so god
[1:02:02] can use you throughout your life not
[1:02:04] when you get to the end of the road and
[1:02:05] say lord i'm sorry lord forgive me and
[1:02:08] that's it
[1:02:09] god wanted to use you way more than you
[1:02:11] wanted to be used but you got to take
[1:02:13] steps in the right direction and they
[1:02:15] said after sampson that day when he
[1:02:17] pushed down the pillars his last day he
[1:02:20] said he killed more that day than he did
[1:02:22] his whole entire life
[1:02:24] see god wants to use you in greater ways
[1:02:27] god could have used him even more
[1:02:28] mightily if he had taken steps in the
[1:02:31] right direction
[1:02:32] if he had taken steps and avoided some
[1:02:34] situations had avoided some people so
[1:02:37] avoided some places god could have done
[1:02:40] some things in his life even more that
[1:02:42] he ever thought it would be accomplished
[1:02:45] see but you got to always be taking
[1:02:47] steps in the right direction you got to
[1:02:49] be pressing forward you got to be
[1:02:51] pushing forward you got to allow god to
[1:02:53] use you and work through you and don't
[1:02:55] ignore the steps that god is placing in
[1:02:57] front of you
[1:02:58] don't ignore because some sometimes the
[1:03:00] best way is through something
[1:03:02] it's not around it it's not over it's
[1:03:04] through it because god want to teach you
[1:03:06] a lesson god want to build some
[1:03:08] character in you he want to allow you to
[1:03:10] grow he wants you to go in the right
[1:03:12] direction he wants you to go in the
[1:03:13] right direction don't avoid that step
[1:03:16] because that was the step that was going
[1:03:17] to take you in the right direction
[1:03:19] this he said many times you get to a
[1:03:21] stairway and there's multiple stairs you
[1:03:23] get to escalate and there's two
[1:03:26] there's one going up and there's one
[1:03:27] going down
[1:03:29] so some fight the hard way they go on
[1:03:31] the elevator going down trying to go up
[1:03:34] it's almost like fighting a losing
[1:03:35] battle
[1:03:36] because each time you take a step up
[1:03:38] it's going down
[1:03:39] each time you take a step up it's going
[1:03:41] down but if you're going in the right
[1:03:43] direction you can you can it's easier to
[1:03:46] go up here because as you step up it
[1:03:48] goes up as you step up and that's just
[1:03:50] like god when you're on in the right
[1:03:52] direction he pulling he pulling those
[1:03:54] steps and he pulling you forward and
[1:03:56] you're going in the right direction you
[1:03:58] got to fight every step of the way you
[1:04:00] got to fight to go up you got to fight
[1:04:02] but god can is able to pull you on
[1:04:05] through he's able to take you that way
[1:04:07] but that was by choice
[1:04:09] you got a choice to make that you can go
[1:04:11] in the right direction or you can go in
[1:04:13] the wrong direction but that choice is
[1:04:15] up to you
[1:04:16] that choice is up to you i can't make
[1:04:18] that decision for you i can't make you
[1:04:20] grow i can't make you go in the right
[1:04:22] direction you got to choose
[1:04:24] what direction you want to go
[1:04:26] you got to choose which way that you
[1:04:28] want to go because god is putting forth
[1:04:31] a choice to you
[1:04:32] each and every day that you wake up god
[1:04:35] put forth a choice to you and which
[1:04:37] direction do you want to go you get to
[1:04:40] make that choice god gave you the
[1:04:42] ability to make that choice but you
[1:04:44] gotta decide which direction you want to
[1:04:46] go
[1:04:46] what steps you want to take do you want
[1:04:49] to go up or do you want to go down
[1:04:51] which steps do you want to go on because
[1:04:53] god has made a way that you can escape
[1:04:57] you can escape the wrath to come the
[1:04:59] world isn't getting any better
[1:05:01] each and every day you see the prices of
[1:05:03] things and you wonder how in the world
[1:05:05] are you going to be aching make it as
[1:05:08] you get paid more things go up more
[1:05:11] the more the more you look at it's like
[1:05:12] you on the same level but god has a way
[1:05:15] of making everything right he has a way
[1:05:18] to show you that this world is not your
[1:05:20] home you just a traveler passing through
[1:05:23] amen because god has a way of helping
[1:05:25] you take the right steps in the right
[1:05:27] direction amen
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:41] step by step amen
[1:05:43] you appreciate the word this morning
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:47] thank the lord for our brother caleb and
[1:05:49] him pouring out his heart amen and
[1:05:51] i just said a lot of things he said was
[1:05:54] it's kind of golden
[1:05:55] like how he says how you going to make
[1:05:57] it
[1:05:58] doing it your own way
[1:06:00] you know i thought about one guy at work
[1:06:03] a young guy he told me
[1:06:05] i don't believe that if to get to heaven
[1:06:07] if there is a god you got to live a
[1:06:08] certain way or do certain things or he
[1:06:11] ain't gonna let you in he says i don't
[1:06:13] think that's right
[1:06:14] i asked him i said well
[1:06:16] would you tell god that he said yes if
[1:06:19] he don't let me and i'll tell him that
[1:06:21] i said well good luck with that
[1:06:24] because that that's what they do right
[1:06:27] man got it in his own mind that he gonna
[1:06:30] tell god what to do
[1:06:31] but it don't work like that do it come
[1:06:33] on i says you know
[1:06:36] one thing
[1:06:37] brother caleb was talking about how
[1:06:38] things can change so quick
[1:06:40] i was thinking about uh last night i was
[1:06:43] telling my in-laws i didn't plan for all
[1:06:45] this this weekend
[1:06:46] you know uh thursday i had a had a
[1:06:49] little notch start coming up in the
[1:06:51] middle of my forehead
[1:06:53] and i thought it was like a
[1:06:55] pimple or bump or something but by
[1:06:57] friday
[1:06:58] all that was swole up and it started
[1:07:00] pushing over into my eye
[1:07:02] i woke up saturday morning couldn't open
[1:07:04] my right eye and i was trying to close
[1:07:06] my left eye
[1:07:07] so i went to the doctor and uh
[1:07:10] they was thinking it might have been an
[1:07:11] insect bite
[1:07:13] but then uh he says we need to cut it
[1:07:15] out right now
[1:07:17] so i wasn't planning for that
[1:07:20] but it gave me shots and when he went to
[1:07:22] cut it out he realized it wasn't an
[1:07:23] insect but he said it was a some type of
[1:07:27] i forgot what they call it satis cysts
[1:07:29] or something like that
[1:07:31] but um he was saying if it don't come
[1:07:33] all the way out you got to go get it
[1:07:35] surgically removed so i was praying
[1:07:38] yesterday i said god i need you to do
[1:07:40] your own operation
[1:07:42] you know so
[1:07:43] you know but i thank god that you know
[1:07:45] we've been blessing them most of the
[1:07:47] swelling went down
[1:07:49] i mean it might look still look bad now
[1:07:50] but god is on the move still
[1:07:53] but i said the thing is i was thinking
[1:07:55] about brother caleb says you know
[1:07:57] about planning you can have plans
[1:07:59] but god can alter them plans
[1:08:02] you know you can have things planned out
[1:08:04] but you wake up tomorrow and god don't
[1:08:05] alter your whole plans
[1:08:08] you know you see how how quickly things
[1:08:10] can change
[1:08:11] i was up me and my wife was up last
[1:08:13] night
[1:08:14] and all of a sudden the whole house
[1:08:16] started shaking
[1:08:18] it didn't last long but the whole house
[1:08:20] shook
[1:08:21] sound like thunder
[1:08:23] first thing i said that's an earthquake
[1:08:25] and that was it was gave you an eerie
[1:08:27] feeling
[1:08:28] because i said you know what happens
[1:08:31] we go on about our own business doing
[1:08:33] our own thing
[1:08:34] you know ain't concerned about our soul
[1:08:36] at all
[1:08:37] oh i got time and all that but you don't
[1:08:39] know at any time
[1:08:41] god can change things
[1:08:43] at any time
[1:08:46] plans can be over with
[1:08:48] i mean any without warning those things
[1:08:51] happen without warning
[1:08:52] you know like hurricanes you see them
[1:08:54] coming all that but earthquakes you
[1:08:56] don't see earthquakes coming
[1:08:58] i said god god can alter your plan at
[1:09:00] any time
[1:09:02] can it
[1:09:02] so why not be right with god at all
[1:09:05] times
[1:09:06] that if he come get you right now you
[1:09:08] say lord i i've done all i can do
[1:09:12] i've done all you asked me to do i'm
[1:09:14] ready right now that's how quickly
[1:09:15] things can change
[1:09:17] you know a lot of times
[1:09:19] things happen you say we get warned
[1:09:21] warning does come before judgment god
[1:09:23] warning you right now
[1:09:24] with the word that he spoke this morning
[1:09:26] ain't it he warning you every time you
[1:09:28] hear that preacher get up in the pulpit
[1:09:30] and call and ask you to give your life
[1:09:32] to god
[1:09:33] he's warning you right then ain't it on
[1:09:35] that day of judgment just like my
[1:09:37] brother caleb was saying you god ain't
[1:09:38] gonna have to judge you you'll judge
[1:09:40] yourself
[1:09:41] by the life that you live it won't be
[1:09:43] nothing new you're here but you'll hear
[1:09:44] that same voice that you heard this
[1:09:46] morning that same voice you heard every
[1:09:48] every sunday morning every friday
[1:09:50] calling out asking you to do what like
[1:09:52] my brother was saying this morning
[1:09:54] repent come on and be baptized every one
[1:09:57] of you in the name of the lord jesus
[1:09:58] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:10:00] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:10:01] holy ghost now why didn't you do it
[1:10:04] come on
[1:10:06] that'll be the thing why you didn't do
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] because at any time things can change
[1:10:11] can it come on i said you know a lot of
[1:10:13] times
[1:10:14] you know
[1:10:15] we look at
[1:10:16] uh things and like you said that you're
[1:10:18] gonna have time but things happen
[1:10:21] in like with the disciples they said we
[1:10:23] thought elias must first come
[1:10:25] and he said he already came but you
[1:10:27] didn't know who he was
[1:10:29] come on and those things what happened
[1:10:31] things just as it was in that day things
[1:10:33] are passed right by you you won't even
[1:10:35] know it the prophet of god talked about
[1:10:37] after the rapture take place people are
[1:10:39] still be giving their life to the god
[1:10:40] still claiming god filled them with the
[1:10:42] holy ghost menace will still be
[1:10:44] preaching the gospel and all going on
[1:10:46] and they won't even know that the holy
[1:10:47] ghost has done lifted off the earth and
[1:10:49] he doesn't turn back to the jews
[1:10:52] they won't even know that but i want to
[1:10:54] say today i don't know about you but i
[1:10:56] want to be ready at all times amen do
[1:10:58] you want to be ready i said see how
[1:11:00] quickly things can change
[1:11:03] you can have plans but god alter your
[1:11:05] plans
[1:11:07] come on
[1:11:09] so i said lord we came out of prayer
[1:11:11] yesterday
[1:11:13] me and my wife and was praying
[1:11:15] and it came in my spirit
[1:11:17] the trust in the lord with all thine
[1:11:19] heart
[1:11:20] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:11:23] but in all of your ways
[1:11:25] acknowledge him and he gonna direct your
[1:11:28] paths
[1:11:30] and that's in the times where you don't
[1:11:31] understand
[1:11:33] and the times you don't know what's
[1:11:34] going on with you he says trust in me
[1:11:38] and i'ma direct your past
[1:11:40] he says acknowledge him now in all your
[1:11:42] ways
[1:11:43] and he gonna direct them i began to pray
[1:11:45] i said lord i want you to leave me
[1:11:48] god guide me
[1:11:50] don't let my eyes lead me don't let my
[1:11:52] wants and the will of his flesh
[1:11:54] the desires of his flesh to leave me
[1:11:56] because you know those things will lead
[1:11:57] you
[1:11:58] you know i believe jeremiah said the
[1:11:59] heart is a seafood and wicked and he
[1:12:01] said full of wickedness and just
[1:12:03] paraphrasing they said who can know it
[1:12:05] your own heart will deceive you that's
[1:12:07] why god wants to give you a new heart
[1:12:09] not the heart of this world but god
[1:12:11] wants to give you something new and
[1:12:13] that's the thing about it uh sometimes
[1:12:15] we say well how we gonna we we got to
[1:12:18] quit trying to figure out how we gonna
[1:12:20] live it
[1:12:21] and just give it to god and allow his
[1:12:23] spirit to come in and live his life
[1:12:25] through you
[1:12:27] trying to figure out how i'm gonna get
[1:12:28] this accomplished how i'm gonna do that
[1:12:30] you got to learn how to let go and let
[1:12:32] god come in your life and do it
[1:12:34] learn how to get out of god's way and
[1:12:36] say lord here here it is lord you take
[1:12:38] over
[1:12:39] take my will lord and and mold it come
[1:12:42] on take my mind like this little song
[1:12:45] says and and transform it to yours
[1:12:48] because that's what god wants to do how
[1:12:49] many believe that this morning i says
[1:12:52] the thing is we can have goals ambitions
[1:12:54] things that we doing things we want to
[1:12:56] get done all these things but we neglect
[1:12:59] the things of the lord
[1:13:01] we neglect your soul
[1:13:03] your that prayer life
[1:13:05] that time with god you neglect those
[1:13:07] things
[1:13:08] and then when god called you'll be
[1:13:10] weighed in the balance and found one
[1:13:13] you ain't got enough to make it over you
[1:13:15] ain't got enough all to make it through
[1:13:17] the night come on because we headed in
[1:13:19] some dark nights ain't we
[1:13:21] demon powers lurking all over the place
[1:13:24] coming from all over us i was looking at
[1:13:26] the other day and they when they uh
[1:13:28] reversed the whole abortion thing and
[1:13:31] now the people just went crazy because
[1:13:33] they telling you not to kill your
[1:13:34] children
[1:13:36] come on
[1:13:38] telling you to preserve life don't kill
[1:13:40] that child people going crazy because
[1:13:42] they want to kill the children say that
[1:13:44] ain't what they want that that's harsh
