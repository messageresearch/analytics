[34:51] serving of God's spoken message on
[34:53] letting off depression
[34:56] I was just ministering uh
[34:59] on the precious
[35:01] the pressure of life
[35:04] you know the pressure of life
[35:08] life has this
[35:10] pressure
[35:12] amen
[35:14] you know sometimes
[35:17] people want to get around pressure
[35:21] and sometimes we look at precious
[35:24] sometimes it comes in the form of
[35:26] sometime trouble
[35:28] trouble isn't
[35:30] when you're in trouble it puts pressure
[35:33] on you
[35:35] you know I
[35:37] uh most everybody I mean even little
[35:41] children small children dealing with
[35:43] hypertension and high blood pressure
[35:48] and you
[35:49] see the
[35:51] that there are so many people that are
[35:54] dealing with high blood pressure
[35:57] and sometimes they tell you to don't eat
[35:59] pork and stay away from Salt and do this
[36:02] and that
[36:04] but same as though sometimes all that
[36:07] you do
[36:09] then pressure is still there
[36:13] because he meant there are so many
[36:15] things that
[36:17] of spiritually and physically cause
[36:21] pressure mentally cause pressure
[36:25] so we're dealing with pressure this
[36:27] morning
[36:29] how do we relieve the pressure how do we
[36:32] let off depression
[36:34] amen because
[36:37] it's very
[36:39] I can be less the pain I can
[36:44] we deal with the discomfort and we're in
[36:48] the calls pressure
[36:50] and you can't hardly find many people
[36:52] that's not worried about something
[36:55] if it's not one thing it's another
[36:58] the causes of folks to be weary
[37:02] amen
[37:04] but here the scripture says a rock
[37:08] in a weary land
[37:13] talking about
[37:17] we have a Rock Amen
[37:20] and it's very
[37:24] prevalent that we try to escape pressure
[37:30] we think that
[37:33] we can do something about it but
[37:36] brothers and sisters you're born in a
[37:41] world and coming and the mother goes
[37:44] through pain in childbirth
[37:47] and the Bible tells us man that is born
[37:50] of a woman is a few days and full of
[37:52] trouble
[37:54] so how can you get around pressure
[37:57] when Trouble Comes amen we find yourself
[38:01] amen under pressure
[38:06] relieving the pressure
[38:09] the book of um Peter first Peter
[38:13] five
[38:16] first Peter 5.
[38:18] and seven
[38:21] God is good
[38:22] [Music]
[38:23] Hallelujah
[38:26] we'll in a very Tech Society
[38:31] world that's full of tension
[38:37] serving to God said you're going on the
[38:39] street and people are racing and
[38:42] people are going off somebody cut in
[38:44] front of them and they want nowadays he
[38:47] was talking about back then nowadays
[38:49] folks will shoot you
[38:51] they're going to kill you you cut it in
[38:53] front of them
[38:56] don't take somebody to Park Place a
[38:58] parking place and didn't see them
[39:00] you might be dead
[39:04] you said I I I you try to explain I
[39:07] didn't oh nope you can't even explain it
[39:10] I was waiting on that parking place and
[39:12] you got in there and you didn't see them
[39:14] you just came around the corner and when
[39:16] it
[39:17] didn't know the other car was waiting
[39:19] over your other side honey are you with
[39:22] me
[39:23] so people are under pressure pressure
[39:26] causes us to respond in certain ways
[39:30] it's causing them to do certain thing
[39:32] because of pressure
[39:35] saying that we wouldn't normally do but
[39:37] under pressure
[39:40] you know we say the Christian is built
[39:43] for pressure
[39:47] see
[39:50] uh you have a you know certain things
[39:54] that you have to pressurize in order for
[39:58] them to function properly
[40:01] and uh that's talking about
[40:05] the pro the brothers Gerald with his
[40:07] guns and those things in order to fire
[40:10] right is suppression but if it's not
[40:13] built right the thing can explode on you
[40:18] backfire
[40:20] it's something if they don't build it
[40:23] right the housing and so forth in it
[40:25] right that thing can backfire on you
[40:28] blow up in your face
[40:31] are you
[40:32] so Amen in order for things not to
[40:36] explode on you and blow up on you
[40:40] it's got to be pressurized right
[40:43] are you with me
[40:45] it's got to be built properly and right
[40:48] can no shortcuts about it
[40:51] are you a man
[40:53] praise God
[40:55] so a lot of things a lot of Christians
[40:57] amen they blow up under pressure
[41:03] praise God and
[41:06] we have a problem because people are
[41:09] blowing up
[41:11] and they're supposed to be built for the
[41:14] pressure
[41:16] are you with me
[41:18] can't deal with it
[41:22] so many Christians they own all types of
[41:25] medication because they can't deal with
[41:28] pressure
[41:32] they're with
[41:34] mental pressure all kind of pressure
[41:37] to take an appeal for this and appear
[41:39] for that
[41:41] and a Christian ought to be built for
[41:43] pressure
[41:47] you know subconsciously I told a young
[41:49] man the other day he's in the hospital

[42:10] everything
[42:12] starts our athlete and everything
[42:15] boxer and all of that wrestler or
[42:18] whatever
[42:19] but Prussia can cause heart trouble
[42:23] young people going out with heart
[42:25] attacks
[42:27] because of pressure
[42:29] you know
[42:31] some folk just can't be nice
[42:34] some folks are just built to be rugged
[42:37] and hard but sometimes you got to be let
[42:40] off that pressure
[42:42] be loving and kind and understanding and
[42:45] compassionate
[42:49] amen don't let other people problems
[42:51] become your problems
[42:54] see a lot of times we have pressure
[42:56] because we worry about all the folks
[43:00] family members and loved ones and that
[43:03] we got the pressure on us
[43:07] because we're so concerned and care so
[43:10] much about them and their problems
[43:13] till we are carrying their problems the
[43:15] Bible said value one another burden but
[43:18] you got to know amen be built to bear
[43:24] you got to know amen if there's a bottom

[44:14] he cares for you are you with me
[44:18] see we we the reason why amen we are
[44:22] under so much tense and so much pressure

[44:29] To God In Prayer
[44:32] amen we said he said cast all cast your
[44:35] cares upon him because he cares for you
[44:40] but the reason why we don't do it
[44:43] because we don't believe he can handle
[44:46] it
[44:48] if we know that he can handle amen then
[44:52] we can cast our cares upon them our
[44:55] problems our condition Our concern amen
[44:58] oh God our pains our trouble we can
