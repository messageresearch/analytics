[34:10] we want to look at the book of second
[34:11] kings three we want to continue on from
[34:14] the other week
[34:18] on a little topic
[34:20] inquiring of the lord amen
[34:23] and did you pray about it we just
[34:27] wanted to try to finish that up by the
[34:29] grace of god
[34:30] tonight
[34:36] second kings three and we'll begin here
[34:39] at the
[34:42] let's begin at the
[34:44] let's begin at the ninth verse
[34:46] if you got it say amen
[34:48] and it reads
[34:50] so the king of israel went and the king
[34:52] of judah and the king of edom and they
[34:54] fetched a compass of seven days journey
[34:57] and there was no water for the host
[34:59] and for the cattle that followed them
[35:03] and the king of israel said alas
[35:06] that the lord have called these three
[35:08] kings together to deliver them into the
[35:10] hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is
[35:13] there not
[35:14] here a prophet of the lord that we may
[35:16] inquire
[35:17] of the lord by him and one of the king
[35:20] of israel's servants answered and said
[35:23] here is elisha the son of shafak which
[35:27] poured water on the hands of elijah you
[35:29] may be seated tonight
[35:31] i'm going to read a little further down
[35:34] say that that poured water on the hands
[35:35] of elijah
[35:37] and 12th verse and joshua said the word
[35:40] of the lord is with is with him so the
[35:42] king of israel and joshua and the king
[35:43] of edom went down to him and elisha said
[35:48] unto the king of israel what have i to
[35:50] do with thee lead to the prophets of thy
[35:52] father unto the prophets of thy mother
[35:54] and the king of israel
[35:56] said unto their nay for the lord have
[35:58] called these three kings together to
[36:00] deliver them into the hand of moab and
[36:02] elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth
[36:04] before whom i stand surely were it not
[36:07] that i regard the president of
[36:08] jehoshaphat the king of judah would not
[36:11] look toward the north see thee
[36:13] but
[36:14] but now bring me a minstrel and it came
[36:16] to pass when the minstrel played
[36:19] that the hand of the lord came upon him
[36:22] and he said thus saith the lord make
[36:24] this valley full of ditches
[36:26] for thus saith the lord you shall not
[36:29] see when nor
[36:30] neither shall you see rain
[36:32] yet the valley shall be filled with
[36:34] water that you may drink both ye and
[36:37] your cattle and your beasts
[36:39] and this is about a light thing in the
[36:41] sight of the lord
[36:42] he will deliver the moral bites also
[36:45] into your hand may god bless to the
[36:47] reading of his word
[36:49] tonight by god's grace like we said we
[36:51] just want to talk to you for a moment
[36:52] just just finish up on
[36:54] on inquiring of the lord amen
[36:57] and you know just just looking here we
[36:59] won't go back over all the other prelude
[37:01] but i just says you know one of the
[37:03] things
[37:04] they were at a time
[37:06] where as a time of battle it was a time
[37:08] the time for to go out to war
[37:10] and so you know they had to come
[37:12] together and
[37:13] they gathered themselves together
[37:15] because it was it was a time
[37:16] for war it was a time to
[37:19] go out because they had rebellion
[37:20] against them and i thought about you
[37:22] know i says that you know where we at
[37:24] now in our in our spiritual walk
[37:27] our christian journey
[37:29] just say even for the sake of time we're
[37:32] at a time of war
[37:33] you know
[37:34] if it ain't one thing it's another the
[37:36] devil is fighting somewhat seemly like
[37:39] on every hand
[37:40] so it's time to go to battle do y'all
[37:42] believe that tonight
[37:43] but we got to know how to fight we can't
[37:46] just go out there
[37:47] and just go to battle and go to war and
[37:48] don't know how to fight giving weapons
[37:50] and don't know how to use them but
[37:52] that's why guard you know by spirit just
[37:55] like in the natural they train you how
[37:57] to go out to battle they train you how
[37:59] to use those weapons in the correct way
[38:01] because if you don't know how to use
[38:02] them in the correct way sometimes they
[38:04] can be more damaging uh to the to the
[38:07] user than they could be the enemy y'all
[38:10] believe that
[38:11] so they so they got the the ways that
[38:13] they that they train before they go out
[38:15] to battle but i said that you know they
[38:17] were in a time of war they had to go out
[38:20] and face the enemy and i thought about
[38:22] that i said you know we talk about
[38:25] it uh
[38:26] we rage it on every hand if it ain't one
[38:28] thing it's another but to really think
[38:30] about what we battle in here
[38:32] what we're dealing with you know we look
[38:35] at the first age and says that you know
[38:37] this age should mirror the first age as
[38:39] we were saying the other day
[38:41] is this age should mirror the first age
[38:44] what if this age should mirror the first
[38:46] age a lot of times we look at the
[38:48] mirroring only to have to do with the
[38:50] power that the first age had
[38:52] to mirror them only in the powers the
[38:55] acts the works that they did we'll do
[38:56] those work with the signs and wonders
[38:58] but remember that people die but spirits
[39:01] don't
[39:02] so the same demons they had to fight you
[39:04] know we got to fight those same demons
[39:06] today
[39:06] so it's not just the mirror and the
[39:08] power but i say are you ready for the
[39:10] persecution as well
[39:12] because just as they were persecuted
[39:14] don't you know you and i are be
[39:16] persecuted
[39:17] even here tonight you say sometimes they
[39:19] gave their natural life and i was saying
[39:22] the other day it may even come to that
[39:24] even here in our that we live in we have
[39:27] so much fanaticism and people now will
[39:29] kill you for anything won't they just
[39:32] for their beliefs and all these things
[39:34] what i say is tonight are
[39:36] are you willing to give your life
[39:39] come on have you counted up the cost of
[39:42] what it's going to take many times we
[39:44] want to be partaken of the glory but not
[39:46] not fellowshipping in the sufferings of
[39:48] christ
[39:49] but you know and that's one thing i said
[39:51] let's reckon tonight when we go out to
[39:53] war let's reckon come on reckon let's
[39:55] count out what the cost going to be
[39:57] let's look at you know the structure and
[40:00] all those things and see you know just
[40:02] exactly what we're facing here tonight
[40:04] and i says that you know as they were
[40:06] going out to ward one thing they one of
[40:09] the main things they did when they went
[40:10] out to battle they might have calculated
[40:12] how many people they had they might have
[40:13] calculated how much how much uh they had
[40:16] to go out for war but one thing they
[40:17] didn't do they didn't they didn't get
[40:20] the one you know the commander-in-chief
[40:23] they didn't consult him
[40:25] they didn't get him to be out in the
[40:26] forefront and that was a big problem and
[40:28] that's what we find
[40:30] even here today like like i said did you
[40:32] pray about it you might have everything
[40:34] calculated figured out but what it is
[40:36] when you when you get out there come on
[40:38] you got to have the commander-in-chief
[40:39] there with you y'all believe that
[40:42] so we find that it says that you know we
[40:43] got to know what we're facing a lot of
[40:45] times you know you go out to war you
[40:47] don't know what you're dealing with you
[40:48] don't know what you you battling i said
[40:50] we're dealing with more demons right now
[40:53] than ever known throughout all of
[40:55] history at one time
[40:57] you know that first age yes they dealt
[40:59] with the white horse rider didn't they
[41:01] then you had the red horse rider and
[41:03] black horse rider come but you know what
[41:04] we dealing with we're dealing with all
[41:06] of them
[41:08] mixed up together right the pale
[41:10] horserider and it says that and death
[41:12] and hell followed them
[41:13] so we got to be more ready now to fight
[41:16] than they even they were back then
[41:18] because we've got a the climax of all of
[41:20] it
[41:20] we got to deal with all the demons at
[41:23] one time and sometimes when we look at
[41:26] the forces that we up against
[41:28] god let you see just what you're dealing
[41:30] with
[41:31] sometimes you say lord how in the world
[41:33] are we going to make it come on but i
[41:35] believe the bible says that we're
[41:37] overcome by the blood of the lamb
[41:39] and by the word of our testimony
[41:42] don't you know that the battle ain't
[41:44] ours but the battle is the lord
[41:46] faith is the victory so you say how are
[41:48] we going to overcome these forces you
[41:50] got to start taking the the shield of
[41:52] faith come on you got to grab the word
[41:54] of god the strong hand of faith and
[41:56] begin believing god for what he said
[41:58] come on do y'all believe that you know i
[42:00] was thinking about something
[42:02] the other day i was telling brother
[42:03] simmons that you know he said something
[42:05] to my sister and and it came to pass
[42:08] just as he told her and i said you know
[42:10] what i told my sister i said that was a
[42:12] word of prophecy come on i said that was
[42:15] a that was a word of prophecy and i said
[42:18] but what it is you got to take it and
[42:20] believe it don't you know god's word is
[42:22] true you know god don't sometimes say
[42:25] have to come do all these special things
[42:27] he's already done it come on he's
[42:30] already laid the foundation open away
[42:32] the problem is we have trouble believing
[42:35] god
[42:36] we have trouble just settling with what
[42:39] god's word is
[42:40] we have trouble with just taking god at
[42:43] his word and saying lord i believe it
[42:45] come on
[42:46] god i'm just going to take you at your
[42:48] word that'll do a lot for us come on
[42:50] that'll move mountains i believe that
[42:53] you know it says that all things are
[42:55] possible to them that believe but but
[42:57] the faith come on move mountains but we
[43:00] find that i said that's what we're
[43:01] dealing with uh tonight you know we're
[43:03] dealing with we're dealing with all
[43:05] these spirits
[43:06] dealing with all these powers
[43:08] how we're dealing with all these unseen
[43:10] things
[43:11] israel could see their enemies you know
[43:14] throughout through the natural house but
[43:16] you and i
[43:17] we're battling a spiritual wickedness in
[43:20] high places
[43:21] we're battling demons on every side
[43:24] we battle and infiltration you don't
[43:26] know who's who's for you and who's
[43:28] against you sometimes
[43:30] you don't know who's possessed by spirit
[43:32] and who ain't sometimes come on
[43:34] even peter when he was beside jesus once
[43:37] and jesus told him you don't know what
[43:38] you're talking about come on you don't
[43:40] know he said get behind me satan why
[43:42] because the enemy had him for trade just
[43:44] like that didn't he and i said that even
[43:47] if the devil was even there present then
[43:50] how much more you think he present here
[43:51] tonight
[43:53] that's why we got to search ourselves
[43:55] daily
[43:57] lord let me find out what spirit i'm of
[44:00] so you got to get up early in the
[44:02] morning come on and seek god
[44:04] lord make the way for me today
[44:07] god keep me in the way
[44:09] i don't even know what i'm facing but
[44:11] god i know you know what i'm facing
[44:13] let the angels go and make the way
[44:14] before me watch over my children watch
[44:16] over me god don't let nothing all those
[44:19] fiery darts are the wicked i can't see
[44:21] him god
[44:22] but by faith i believe hallelujah that
[44:25] the blood has been applied
[44:28] and the devil can't cross that bloodline
[44:30] come on do y'all believe that
[44:32] those children of israel the night when
[44:34] the death angel passed by only thing
[44:37] they can do is hold on to a promise that
[44:39] god gave them right
[44:41] that if you place the blood over the
[44:43] door it says the night when the death
[44:44] angel comes
[44:45] come on
[44:46] he'll pass right
[44:49] so they all they could do was hold on to
[44:51] a promise that they had
[44:53] but you know the promise wouldn't have
[44:55] did them no good unless they put the
[44:57] blood on the door
[44:58] come on
[44:59] putting the blood on the door that that
[45:01] was that was going to keep the promise
[45:04] alive was putting the blood on the door
[45:06] hallelujah
[45:07] god made us many promises didn't he
[45:10] but what keeps that promise alive
[45:12] hallelujah you got to have faith to hold
[45:14] on to it
[45:16] you got to have faith to live the word
[45:18] faith to believe god faith that god will
[45:21] keep you faith that god will heal you
[45:23] faith that god is delivering you
[45:25] hallelujah how we gonna do it lord i
[45:28] don't know but i'm holding on to it
[45:30] god i believe what you said
[45:32] and that settles i'm going on with it

[45:52] you don't mind
[45:54] some in our studies we can't get away
[45:55] from that

[45:59] plenty in this age of progress in this
[46:01] age of abundance
[46:03] how how can there be more trials well
[46:05] now it is strange but in this age of
[46:08] plenty and opportunity when everyone has
[46:11] so much
[46:12] and there is so much more to be had
[46:15] with all the inventions to do our work
[46:17] and so many things to give us pleasure
[46:20] suddenly we find mental illness
[46:22] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[46:25] nation
[46:26] when everybody ought to be happy with
[46:29] really nothing to be unhappy about
[46:31] millions are taking sedatives at night
[46:34] pet pills in the morning rushing the
[46:36] doctors entering institutions and trying
[46:39] to down drown out unknown fears by
[46:42] alcohol yes this age boasts a tremendous
[46:45] stores in the world of goods but the
[46:46] people are less happy than ever this age
[46:49] boasts of spiritual attainments but the
[46:51] people are less sure of themselves than
[46:53] they ever his age boasts to moral values
[46:55] and it is more corrupt than any age ever

[47:00] knowledge in science but it's fighting a
[47:03] losing battle in all fields come on
[47:07] fighting a losing battle i said we at

[47:42] sometimes people don't even know what's
[47:44] wrong with them hallelujah well the
[47:47] devil does that come on but it's
[47:49] something about the peace of god
[47:51] something about when the holy ghost
[47:53] comes down in the soul and sweeps out
[47:55] all the uh uncle corruption and all
[47:58] those things comes down and sweeps out
[48:00] all the bitterness sweeps out all the

[48:21] the age boasts a better moral values and
[48:23] is more corrupt than any age since the
[48:25] flood it talks about knowledge and
[48:27] science but it is fighting and losing
[48:29] battle all fields for the human mind and
[48:31] the soul

[55:41] learn to cry to god again and call on
[55:44] him while he's still able to be found
[55:46] i'm so glad today his ears ain't too
[55:49] heavy now his arms ain't too short we
[55:51] can still call on him come on i said
[55:54] call on him while he's still hearing you
[55:56] hallelujah don't wait to the time where
[55:59] he turned his face against you
[56:01] come on like jeremiah began to cry out
[56:03] to him that god turned his face against
[56:05] this city
[56:06] hallelujah he gonna destroy it with fire
[56:09] unless you repent don't you know that
[56:11] god has turned his face against his
[56:13] world
[56:14] come on they say america the whole world
[56:16] going insane come on hallelujah oh jesus
[56:21] but i'm glad that god's got us in his
[56:23] hand come on
[56:25] aren't y'all glad tonight
[56:26] oh jesus says but what it is they found
[56:29] that place like i said you got to
[56:30] inquire of the lord that's one thing
[56:32] they didn't do they didn't inquire in
[56:34] the lord so they got themselves out
[56:35] there on this journey without without
[56:38] the necessity the one little small thing
[56:40] that they didn't think about was now
[56:43] become such a
[56:45] the most thing that they needed in their
[56:46] journey and that was water right
[56:49] the prophet of god was bringing out
[56:51] typing out that water
[56:53] them going on a journey without water
[56:55] it's like the church
[56:57] moving on without the supernatural
[56:59] he said that's what it is they think
[57:01] they don't need it they got the they got
[57:03] the word they got this they got that now
[57:05] he said they're going on without the
[57:06] power come on they forgot about the
[57:09] power
[57:10] they forgot about the supernatural they
[57:12] forgot about the holy ghost fire baptism
[57:15] they forgot about that hallelujah but
[57:18] when they get out there and realize that
[57:20] the enemy is coming
[57:22] come on
[57:24] he coming
[57:25] he ain't playing around when they
[57:27] realize that their crowd
[57:29] hallelujah is there anybody here that
[57:32] can get a hold of god don't let it be
[57:34] too late come on
[57:36] oh jesus
[57:37] hallelujah he said that that's one thing
[57:39] that
[57:40] uh they forgot about he said like the
[57:42] church moving on today
[57:45] without without the supernatural
[57:47] you know i want to read something he
[57:48] said he says in the there are radio
[57:51] programs television programs
[57:53] and numerous church endeavors that are
[57:55] costing millions and millions of dollars
[57:58] wealth pours and pours into the church
[58:00] the membership increases along with the
[58:03] money yet the work is not being done
[58:06] as it was done when there was no money
[58:09] but
[58:10] rested solely on the ability given them
[58:13] by the holy ghost
[58:14] they are paid preachers paid assistance
[58:16] paid ministers of music and education
[58:19] paid choirs paid custodians programs and
[58:22] entertainment all costing great sums but
[58:25] for all of that the power is decreasing
[58:29] yes the church is rich but the power is
[58:31] not there
[58:33] god moves by his spirit not by the
[58:35] amount of money or talent you have in
[58:37] the church
[58:38] come on
[58:40] he says all that we got all that
[58:42] everything accessible now he says but
[58:45] we're doing what we're doing way more
[58:46] less than we
[58:48] are now than we did when we had the
[58:49] money
[58:50] way less now
[58:52] than you did when you didn't have
[58:54] he says we've got all these things he
[58:56] said yet the power is decreasing
[58:59] come on
[59:01] i said lord we want the power
[59:04] if we got to get back down on our knees
[59:06] crowd
[59:07] however long it takes god we need the
[59:09] power
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:12] children are being lost we need the
[59:14] power
[59:14] homes are being destroyed we need the
[59:16] power people are dying in sin
[59:19] what good is money then hallelujah
[59:22] without the power what good is church
[59:24] without the power hallelujah oh jesus
[59:28] you know i thought about israel and i
[59:29] said what separated them from the other
[59:31] nations was the supernatural right
[59:34] and they came out they had a cloud lead
[59:36] them by day fire there by night
[59:39] hallelujah everywhere they went they
[59:41] carry the ark out there i see the
[59:43] enemies when they going out to battle
[59:44] the enemies to see that heart coming see
[59:46] the cloud or whatever they go running
[59:49] shaking for fear hiding in heels why
[59:52] not just because of israel was some
[59:54] great nation because remember god said i
[59:56] chose you because you the least of all
[59:59] but they saw a power in that nation
[1:00:02] they saw a god a living guard in that
[1:00:05] nation so no matter they all come
[1:00:08] together to fight against israel but
[1:00:11] even even and they was going on a
[1:00:13] jericho wherever it was they began to
[1:00:15] testify that all the inhabitants are in
[1:00:18] fear their hearts are melting because
[1:00:20] they hear you coming hallelujah you
[1:00:22] might not seem to be the biggest group
[1:00:24] in all those things but we heard what
[1:00:26] god is doing among you
[1:00:28] hallelujah that's what separated them
[1:00:31] but from everybody else was the
[1:00:33] supernatural don't you know the devil
[1:00:35] ain't afraid of your church
[1:00:37] he ain't afraid come on come sit down in
[1:00:40] there what makes demons true is when you
[1:00:43] got the living god among you when
[1:00:45] somebody calling on that name of jesus
[1:00:47] hallelujah that's power behind that
[1:00:50] he'll go running for fear and warning
[1:00:52] come on
[1:00:53] many people call the name of jesus but
[1:00:55] demons don't tremble
[1:00:57] because he look at their life ain't no
[1:00:59] power in their voice
[1:01:00] hallelujah but when it's power in your
[1:01:03] voice when you live in the you got the
[1:01:05] life to back it up hallelujah you call
[1:01:07] that name jesus demons are flee that was
[1:01:11] a tremble hallelujah oh jesus do y'all
[1:01:14] believe that tonight that's why i said
[1:01:16] the devil ain't afraid to come to your
[1:01:17] church he ain't afraid
[1:01:20] especially if he don't see the he don't
[1:01:21] see the cloud
[1:01:23] he don't see a supernatural out among
[1:01:25] you but that's what made the difference
[1:01:27] come on god didn't just call us out to
[1:01:29] be a regular normal people or just
[1:01:32] another god i don't believe god saved me
[1:01:35] from a life of sin
[1:01:36] brought me
[1:01:37] filled me with a spirit
[1:01:39] just brought me from a mighty long way
[1:01:41] to just sit in church and be normal sit
[1:01:44] in church and just be cold just go
[1:01:46] through the motion of tradition come on
[1:01:48] god didn't do us like that
[1:01:50] but god brought you out
[1:01:52] so he can make you an example
[1:01:55] to the world that i'm still alive and
[1:01:58] well
[1:01:58] hallelujah
[1:02:00] oh jesus that god is still here
[1:02:03] that when everybody got claims that god
[1:02:06] is dead hallelujah god will raise you up
[1:02:09] here's one
[1:02:10] oh jesus
[1:02:13] that can testify that he's the same
[1:02:15] yesterday today and forever here's one
[1:02:18] hallelujah that can testify that he
[1:02:21] still heals that he still delivers that
[1:02:24] he's still safe here's one hallelujah
[1:02:27] have you considered my servant
[1:02:29] hallelujah come on god didn't just call
[1:02:32] you out to hold a pew come on god got
[1:02:34] the work that you want you do but you
[1:02:36] got the yield of god come on let go of
[1:02:39] the world and all those things i thought
[1:02:41] about that i said israel what made them
[1:02:43] separate from the rest of the nations
[1:02:45] was the supernatural come on looking at
[1:02:48] how the inhabitants were shaken when
[1:02:50] they heard that israel knows what's
[1:02:52] coming i said but what happened to those
[1:02:54] people
[1:02:55] what happened to the fire
[1:02:58] what happened to the power
[1:03:00] what happened to the fear that fell on
[1:03:02] the inhabitants of the land when they
[1:03:04] heard israel was coming what happened
[1:03:06] hallelujah
[1:03:07] but they got to that place of
[1:03:09] complacency they got to that place when
[1:03:12] they got in the land hallelujah began
[1:03:14] looking around at the other nations and
[1:03:16] everything want to be like everybody
[1:03:18] else but i said i began to look at my
[1:03:21] life hallelujah and i pray you look at
[1:03:23] your life tonight i said when you were
[1:03:25] desperate when you were out and sin you
[1:03:28] didn't know how you was gonna make it
[1:03:29] tomorrow come on you didn't want to be
[1:03:31] like everybody else you want god to do
[1:03:34] something special in you and you was
[1:03:36] willing to do whatever god has to get a
[1:03:38] move of god in your life
[1:03:40] but after god done brought you out
[1:03:42] hallelujah god damn made away sometimes
[1:03:45] we sit and we get complacent
[1:03:48] oh hallelujah

[1:04:05] want you to make a choice they choose i
[1:04:07] want you to choose if god be god serve
[1:04:09] him but if you want to serve the other
[1:04:11] gods he said go ahead
[1:04:13] but i know one thing
[1:04:14] like you said for me at my house we're
[1:04:16] going to serve the lord
[1:04:18] because he says remember you make that
[1:04:20] choice
[1:04:21] god you see what god did to the habits
[1:04:23] of the land because of their sins
[1:04:25] because of their iniquities and their
[1:04:26] deeds and i began to share with my son
[1:04:28] moses i said the thing is you got to
[1:04:30] look at your life and where are you at
[1:04:32] right now and i said the lord shall
[1:04:34] terry where you end up tomorrow i said
[1:04:37] to be the result of a decision that you
[1:04:39] made the result of choices that you made
[1:04:42] so i began to tell you you got to make
[1:04:44] the right choices
[1:04:45] you got to choose hallelujah whether you
[1:04:48] want to serve god or serve the world you
[1:04:51] got to make that choice nobody can make
[1:04:54] that choice for you but i want to let
[1:04:55] you know
[1:04:56] i says that if you make that choice
[1:04:59] remember what god did to so many before
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:03] what god
[1:05:04] so many witnesses before you that you
[1:05:06] seen the end of it
[1:05:08] i said but you still got to make a
[1:05:10] choice
[1:05:10] come on but i said choosing jesus is the
[1:05:13] right thing do y'all believe that
[1:05:14] tonight i know y'all do hallelujah but i
[1:05:18] said that what it is we got to we got to
[1:05:20] find i said we come there you know i
[1:05:22] said what happened to that group but

[1:05:26] you know and then they decide we want to
[1:05:28] acquire the lord thank thanks be to god
[1:05:30] that he was still able to be found but
[1:05:33] when they begin to go to guard come on
[1:05:35] you know and i like i like that what it
[1:05:38] did you know it brought the supernatural
[1:05:40] back among them i like how elisha told
[1:05:42] him he said don't look for rain don't
