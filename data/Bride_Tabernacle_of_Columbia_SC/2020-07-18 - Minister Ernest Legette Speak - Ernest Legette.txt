on our behalf oh god give us enlightenment oh god to our souls lord we thank you bless your name father for we love you in jesus name we pray amen we want to look at the book of matthew about god's grace matthew 8 will begin at the first verse matter of fact we'll begin at the fifth verse tonight i want to minister on a topic and i entitled it speak amen speak amen speak and it'll be as you say amen speak matthew eight and five and it reads and jesus was entered into capernaum and when jesus entered into capernaum there came unto him a censuring a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the policy charm in it and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him and the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i'm a man of authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great of faith no not in israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob and in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into into utter darkness outer darkness there shall be weeping and nationality and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour may god had a blessed reading of his word may be seated tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to speak to you on on a topic of speak amen speak i like how here that we find in this setting of the scriptures that the centurion you know no doubt had heard of the fame of jesus and in jesus he recognized the the authority and the capabilities that that jesus had he recognized we say what jesus was capable of because he even said it in his speaking that he says that you know i'm a man of under authority so he could he spoke to jesus because what he saw in jesus was authority so he began to ask uh jesus he says you don't even have to come to my house but what i see in you i see the the capabilities i see the power in you that all you've got to do is speak it and it'll be just as you said and a lot of times i believe today that you know as we talk about how the church world and the world itself today has lost the respect for the ministry we find is that it's because sometimes they've lost that insight or the or of just how powerful the spoken word of god is they lost their insights sometimes of just of the ability that's in the one that gave the word come on and that's why he says in one's place he says that you know before any man coming to god he got the first believe that he is god and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him before you even come to him you got to first have a faith uh to believe come on that he is god and that there's nothing that we say that that can stand before him but it's recognizing the capabilities of the one that gave the word and that's what we're looking at here i said you know i was thinking of myself i says we're living in such a we call them unstable times and we do things now a lot of times in such which seem to be an unorthodox way you know we used to sometimes in service and how the people could come to the altar and you lay hands on them and and praying with them and help you know pray them through but i say it's in the hours our that we live in i believe that just now even though as we might not be doing things in the way that we we used to uh uh do i'm gonna achieve them but that don't stop god from being who he is that don't stop the ability of the power that's in god come on i believe that jesus was going out in that day laying hands on a sick and they were recovering but that centurion he took it to a whole nother level he took it to a whole nother we would call extreme he says come on if he got the power like that you don't even have to come to my house you don't have to lay hands on my servant or do anything like that all i need to do is to hear you speak the word and i know it'll be as you say come on and i said that's what the faith of the people even an hour that we live in has arrived to that occasion it has to rise you know the bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood that the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard come on to to to do to go against the enemy come on when the devil come in and raging and roaring you know like a mighty lion guard sends an anointing to meet him on that plane hallelujah where he is and that anointing that when god sends and meet him on that plane come on it'll defeat him or no matter what ground he's on i like how in the scriptures how it was one place where the enemy was saying i forget it whether it was in the mountain or the valley he said let's go there because we'll be able to defeat him there and god told told his children of israel i want you to go in that place because i'ma show them i'm god of the mountain just as i'm god in the valleys come on no matter where the battleground is god is still the victorious he's still all powerful he's still overcomer why because he is god amen and the spirit of the lord like we said or lift up a standard come on hallelujah as the demon powers rage don't you know the anointing is lifting up a standard god's spirit is raising us up to a place to what he's saying you can't no longer stay down there but you got to let me lift you up hallelujah let the word or do something in your life and i says that's what it is it's no longer just hearing good sermons but the word of god you've got to open up and let it go past your intellectual knowledge of your head and your reasoning and all your thinking but it's got to let it get down to the depths of the soul where the holy ghost can take it and make the world live again bringing you to a place that nobody else can't see i like that how jesus told his disciples he says the world won't be able to see me he said but you'll be able to see me he said why because i'll be no longer with you but i'll be in you how in the form of the holy ghost when the world in the church world ain't seeing the power of god no more when only thing they looking at is stories and good sermons the people of god those that's been born again those that open up their heart and the word of god has come in he's brought them to a place to where they still seen guard to where they still didn't lose their faith in god but they still got faith hallelujah the move mountains and i believe that but i'm talking about tonight speak i like that how the centurion begin to tell jesus he says speak come on and it'll be just as you say recognizing that that authority that uh uh uh the ability that was in christ and i want to say that you know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god didn't quit speaking god is still speaking but it takes your faith grab and hold to the word and believing it on him just as the scriptures say and watch the rivers of water of living waters flow from out of your belly how would it flow from out of your belly because it'll be coming out of your mouth which you speak there'll be life you speaking life wherever you go the dead situation you speak into those situations to those that are going through you speaking life into those situations and bringing the people into a hope hallelujah and i believe that god is so good to us you know i said speak tonight we look at how you know we know that everything i was just meditating in prayer the other day i said you know we got to realize just how powerful the spoken word of god is come on you know everything that we see i i began to meditate in prayer the trees the dust and and the cars and everything that we see and have access you know to in the world today was are all a result a result of the spoken word of god god said let there be come on he didn't even have the he didn't have to get the materials and all of that but when the spoken word went out it created hallelujah it created those things that we see today in the spoken word is the ability to create and that's what it is you know we says that uh uh we do believe that in the book of hebrews 11 it says that the things that we cannot see come on there are the real things because the things that we see they were made by the things which we cannot see come on and that's what it is the spoken word of god when he spoke the word it created hallelujah and that's the same thing today i said if he put the words in your mouth when you speak you don't have to that's what the devil does he makes us uh always think that we got to see the situation out we got to see the door open we got to see our way out come on but it ain't in sin it ain't touching him feeling in his five senses but it's in only speaking and believing the word come on i believe god spoke the word and he believed what he said when he said let there be it had no other choice but to come forth why because he spoke the word and it created hallelujah and you and i today can see we got that same you know he said he said the works that i do shall you do also come on i'm talking about getting to a place to where you're not just a a former church goer you're not just one that sit in the pews and clap your hands and sing a song and just praise the lord and shout and dance but you got a hold of something you got a hold of life and something down in the depths of your soul beginning speaking hallelujah and create that's what it is i said we in the time now where we got to create our own uh a way out of this situation come on how are you going to do it because you're going to speak it and you're going to start believing what you speak you're going to start speaking like you're more than an overcomer like you more than the conquering in the devil ain't got no other choice but to move how many believe that hallelujah i said speak come on everything we see today is a product we say of the spoken word of god god spoke it out we look it says by the word of god the bible says that the worlds they were formed come on that's how it was by the word of god the saints of old the bible said believe that they believed that god spoke the word and it came to pass and if the saints of old can believe it it could move mountains with what they believe how about you and i believing in that same spoken word of god today i believe that it'll still it'll still uh move mountains i look at how i said that just as god spoke the word and the power that was in that word that he spoke i said i began to look at certain things in the scriptures i said god just as you spoke and it obeyed you i said lord you spoke some things concerning us in the hour that we live in and just as it had to come to pass then god what you spoke it's got to come to pass now sometimes we worried and we be weary because we seeing the times in the battle that we faced with but i don't believe that david was worried about goliath standing up there in front of him but he remembered that that abraham seed was going to be blessed no matter what and he was going to possess all the gates of his enemies and no man wouldn't be able to stand before him long as god was on his side he began to say you come with me to a sword in a spirit i don't even have those things but what i do know i'm coming to you in the name of the lord and that word that he given us is more powerful to take down a giant i don't care what giant is in your life but what you're faced with today let god be the control of that situation move out the way and let god speak on your behalf let god create signs and wonders in your life and god will do it how many believe that come on we're talking about speak i said you know just as we look at that says god even today that same god he spoke some some words about you and i come on and it got to come to pass just as it come to pass then it's got to come to pass now i like how you know in the scriptures how he says that they are overcome by the blood of the lamb hallelujah he said they have overcome come on not that you will they have overcome they've overcome how did they overcome by the blood of the lamb hallelujah you know the battle is already won the battle is already finished once you give your life to christ and open up your heart and let jesus come in come on the devil is already defeated yes we got to go through growing stages and pains and all these things to try us but what it is god bringing us to perfection god ain't gonna let you fall to the ground but before he let that happen i believe he'll bankrupt heaven but god allows certain things to happen in our lives just to get us to the next level bring us to the next phase in him hallelujah god bringing us through stepping stones and stumbling blocks come on god say turn those stumbling blocks into your stepping stones god building the stairway on up to that place in in christ jesus where you got to be and i believe that come on he said they have overcome you know about the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony come on i believe that he said like the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony somewhere along the line they had to start speaking their testimony not my testimony but your testimony not your testimony but my testimony come on what has god done for you lately i can talk to you about what god has done for me but you need your personal experience you got to know god for yourself because that's going to be your overcoming power that's going to be what create a deliverance in your life you got to start testifying you got to start believing that god will do just what he said he'll do you know i was sharing with my uncle once and when he was when he was uh dying and i began to tell him he was having a uh uh uh issues and the trouble with being healed in divine healing and i began to tell them i says you know my uncle herman i began to say to him i said you know when you speaking i said you speak in your own world and to exist you speaking that atmosphere around you i said what it is i said let me let me share one thing which i'll say is when you gave your life to the lord or when i gave my life to the lord and began speaking i said just as i left the altar that day i was telling everybody hey i'm saved come on i'm saved now people can look at you and say you were out in the world last night but now you're saying i'm saved today i said what it is i kept speaking that i was saved until i became what i spoke come on now i could have left and just had doubt but i believed it i believe that he said come on if if i can repent and be baptized come on believe on him as the scriptures say come on then he would he would save me because he died for the sins of the whole world and i was counted in that number so i might have not been where i posted being yesterday but i'm saved today why because i'm speaking it it's the word of my testimony i'm saved and i said i kept speaking it until the manifestation of it i had no other choice but to walk into what i spoke and i said the same way same faith that we use for salvation it's not in the preacher that preached it it's not in someone that told you but it's in you believing the spoken word of god it said you believe in what god said come on and something happened something took place down on the inside to us to a place now that nobody can't take that away from you they might point at your faults the devil might bring all kind of clouds of witness against you but i'm so glad to know that even today i ain't standing for myself but the blood hallelujah and signed my name in the blood is there as a token that i can be saved and i said just as you spoke uh you speak that concerning salvation it's the same way with healing come on it's the same faith you got to speak no matter how bad your body feels you got to speak that i'm healed you got to speak that it's all in the name of jesus come on i feel all right come on somebody i feel like dancing i feel like shouting you might be feeling all kind of pains but speak your way out that pain speak your way up that situation speak your way out of those shackles and the things that got you bound begin speaking and watch god do something in your life why because it's the spoken word of god it's what god spoke and the devil has no other choice but to obey it hallelujah we back to that time again the way we can speak and god said it'll be as you say speak to the mountain speak to your situation speak to your storm i'm putting the words in your mouth hallelujah and watch the devil flee i believe that with all of my heart come on i say speak come on speak in the midst of i was thinking to uh in prayer in the midst of all this world confusion i was thinking i was in prayer and i said you know just meditating on that they overcome come on by the blood of the lamb and the word of that testimony i say that the world should last another 10 years from now think about how chaotic it'll be you think about the transition that the world has made in the last 20 years can we stand another 20 more years 30 more years of the world being engulfed in sin going deeper and further away from god i thought about how the scripture says that as it was in the days of noah you know the bible says that the imagination of men's heart clone was on evil continually all they thought about was sinning all they thought about was doing things that was displeasing to god that's all they thought about come on that's what was in their heart but i believe that even right now jesus said they overcame come on they had still had somebody whose heart wasn't corrupted whose mind wasn't defiled by the ways of the world but in their heart they still want to please god they held on in the midst of all the darkness in the midst of all the crisis why because it wasn't them but it was christ in them giving them unction from the holy one it was god that kept them the whole time i said god thank you you know when i lay down at night i say lord thank you for keeping us one more day lord you know why because we're kept by the power of god we're kept by god's power and what he's done for us how many believe that amen speak i said speak tonight come on we're thinking about how it says in the mystery confusion it's going to be a group of people in the midst of the darkness it's going to be a group of people that they gonna get the revelation that they're gonna begin speaking speaking their way out of darkness speaking their way out of all the confusion and they still see the light they still find jesus in a world that's broken in the world that's in chaos and pain hallelujah i preached the other week on a sermon in the world in pain and how when jesus came or how much torment they were going through and how much chaotic the world was jesus said a company healed a broken heart i come to set the captive free he came to him hallelujah in a time when they were in pain in a time when they were hurting and he began to share with them i've come to do for you what the church world can't do i'll come to do for you what the synagogues and what the sacrifices can't do i came to bring you to another place to a place of the supernatural to a place the way angels will be appearing to a place the way healings the miraculous the dead will raise why because i come to do those things hallelujah he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he half anointed me to preach the gospel i said lord let the spirit of the god fall on the minister today the anointing the people are hurting people are in pain they need your help god anoint them lord let them speak the words of life we had enough good sermons and good preachers good church hallelujah lord we need to quicken in power we need something that's going to change the lives of people we need something that's going to uproot satan out of people's lives and cause them to want to come forth and live for the living god that's what we need how many believe that i said speak come on i like that how like i said he says that you're overcome by the blood of the lamb come on in the word of their testimony let's look at matthew 21 by god's grace matthew 21-21 god is good amen i said speak tonight matthew 21 and and 21. let's begin at 18th verse and it reads now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for forever and presently and presently the fig tree withered away jesus and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and not doubt and doubt not he shall not only do this which is done in the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and so whatsoever things and all these things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive come on i said speak tonight we find that here i like how the the centurion told jesus in our early scripture reading he said lord speak and i believe you know it'll be as you say but here jesus come you know and the disciples were marveling because jesus being a hunger the bible says that he saw a fig tree and it didn't have no figs even though it wasn't even the time for the figs to be upon the tree god cursed the tree and no soon as he cursed it when they came back around to it it was already dead and dried up and they began marveling to jesus about this victory but jesus began to say unto them come on that you don't have to marvel but with the same power that i spoke to this tree you got the same power shall have that same power in you all you got to do is speak and don't doubt it come on he put that in there and don't doubt it somebody said i know the lord do it but come on no don't doubt it there's no buts about it you just speak and that's it that settles it go on in god come on but he says that it'll be as you say come on the spoken word i want you to speak the word out of your mouth come on he said if you say to this mount come on why did he use mountains most likely because god knew that the road was going to be hard the trials and tribulations was up ahead you're gonna have some mountains you're gonna have some stormy days some weather and some rain to come in your life but all you got to do is speak don't doubt it hallelujah how many want to speak tonight i said speak and don't doubt it but it'll be as you say god i'm speaking my way into deliverance i'm speaking my way in out of this situation i'm speaking the devil out of my home away from my life i'm speaking it why because god has given me that authority don't you know god has given you authority and power in his name he said whatever you do do it in the name of the lord lord in jesus name devil get behind me in jesus name hallelujah i'm speaking it why because god has given me the authority satan you got to turn them loose why because god has given us the authority he promised this word that if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover it ain't in me but it's in god he spoke the word i'm only repeating what he said hallelujah and i heard it down in the depths of my soul i heard it rave out and say speak my word don't hold it back speak my word tell them what i said it'll come to pass and i believe that but you and i as individuals got to start having faith you got to start hearing that down in the deep you got to start getting unction from the holy one that thing that rings out in your soul and said i know all the odds is against you but you look to the heels from which cometh your help i'ma help you hallelujah i'ma help you in the midst of what you're going through i'ma help you in the midst of the crisis imma help you in the midst of the storm look up and begin to speak don't have doubt come on but have faith speak hallelujah i like how in the scriptures god always allowed us to see glimpses hallelujah of what the spoken word can do i believe moses standing on the on the banks of the red sea was crying and god began to say to him why are you crying he told him speak speak the word and go forth i'ma open the waters i'm gonna take care of your enemies but i want you to speak the words hallelujah don't cry speak don't sit there with your mouth close speak open your mouth speak the word speak the word hallelujah don't cry to me speak hallelujah the word just start flowing out of your mouth scriptures begin to come alive why because you're seeing jesus christ the same yesterday the day and forever and no devil can't stop you now why because you got a hold of something and when it comes out it's like a roaring lion hallelujah he says speak i believe joshua when they were in the battle come on something gave him auction to speak he looked up at the sun and he said stand still stand there and move i want you to stand over here and it hearkened to his voice why because it was the spoken word that came out i believe it was the same power that god used when he created them they knew it was the master speaking it's no longer you but it's christ in you speaking it's the anointing it's the quickening power all flesh has gotten out of the way god has got you in a corner the way you know you can't do it by yourself and he says speak the word and it'll be as you say come on i say glimpses of that spoken word god is so good i want you to speak i said you know there's so many situations and like i said now the way we're doing things today might be a little orthodox come on but what is god doing lifting up a standard what is god doing raising you higher to a place to where you're no longer depending on man to lay hands on you man to do this and man come on but he said i want you to start speaking you crying speak i'm still god you know my voice come on i believe that it says the name of the lord is strong tower is a strong tower let the righteous run to and they'll save god is still here doing the same things that he always done let the word i believe that begin lifting you up come on to a place i says that's that's the need you know for the holy ghost the holy ghost got to give you unction you got to hear it's got to be something down in the deeps in the depths of coming out from somewhere the bible says the deep caller to the deep there got to be a deep to respond something i believe is called come on free from from the deep from the depths of your soul saying what let my word let me take you higher amen deep call it to the deep as the noise of the water sprout amen we thank god for the word tonight amen because the spoken word is the original seed and we know whatever we say the power of death and life is in the tongue amen the created power of god that we can create create worlds and live that's what sons and daughters of god hear come to manifest the word come to make the word live so we thank god for the spoken word thank god for god giving us a servant that could look beyond the curtains of time and knows what it takes to get out of here amen when this pandemic came amen god is saying speak the word speak the word amen maybe some tragedies in the battle and a wall amen but you got to keep speaking maybe some disappointment but you got to keep speaking amen some soldiers might fall by the but you got to keep speaking amen we're still in the battle amen you got to win and god said you already won the battle the victory has already been won amen jesus has already given us the victory so let us by heads
