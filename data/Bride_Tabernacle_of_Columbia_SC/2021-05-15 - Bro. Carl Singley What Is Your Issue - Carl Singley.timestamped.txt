[36:10] garment for she said
[36:13] if i may touch buddy's clothes i shall
[36:16] be who
[36:17] and straightway the fountain of her
[36:19] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[36:21] body that she was healed
[36:23] of that plague and jesus
[36:26] immediately knewing in himself that
[36:28] virtue had gone out of him
[36:30] turned him about in the press and said
[36:32] who touched
[36:33] my clothes and the disciples said unto
[36:36] him thou seest the multitude throng in
[36:38] thee
[36:38] and says thou who touched me and he
[36:40] looked around about to see her that had
[36:42] done this thing
[36:43] but the woman fearing and trembling
[36:46] knowing what was done in her
[36:48] came and fell down before him and told
[36:51] him
[36:52] all the truth hallelujah and he said
[36:55] unto her

[50:08] walking baby
[50:10] keep walking he walked going on up the
[50:12] street and as he got up the street there
[50:13] was this little
[50:14] black lady hanging on the fence
[50:17] with ragti around the head she looked at
[50:20] him she said
[50:21] more than parsons he said how do you
[50:24] know i'm a person
[50:26] he said the lord told me you was coming

[50:58] child
[51:00] because he was on the bed he meant
[51:02] talking out of his head
[51:03] amen because he had the social disease
[51:06] so the prophet as he prayed he went back
[51:08] to the apple he had been gone for
[51:09] several hours amen and but as soon as he
[51:12] got back there
[51:13] he said the last call for a certain
[51:16] number of flight hallelujah
[51:18] in other words that little blight lady's
[51:20] prayer
[51:21] had held up that airplane is that right
[51:24] amen hallelujah amen i said this in type
[51:27] that
[51:28] during the 1960s 1963 after them seals
[51:32] was open
[51:33] the rapture was ready to go there is
[51:35] that right
[51:36] about in the days of the voice of the
[51:38] seventh century when he began to sound
[51:39] the mystery of god
[51:40] shall be finished is that right
[51:42] hallelujah amen
[51:44] it was finished he's right but see god
[51:46] held that rapture up
[51:48] because we black people weren't ready
[51:51] that's the truth is that right
[51:53] amen we were too busy worrying about
[51:54] social change
[51:56] say it loud i'm black and i'm proud
[51:58] anyway brother simmer probably had afro
[52:00] on his head he's on it
[52:01] is that right here right it got what
[52:03] trying to get social change
[52:05] i mean we wasn't ready for it amen so
[52:08] god held that thing up amen
[52:10] but see we're backing now in the spirit
[52:11] of the sixes again
[52:13] racism space travel is that right
[52:17] amen see they changed up the voting laws
[52:19] again back then in the 60s we couldn't
[52:21] we black people couldn't even vote you
[52:24] did you vote you had to go to the poll
[52:25] pay a poll attack is that right you had
[52:27] to read a little piece of paper
[52:29] hallelujah now they change their laws
[52:31] and voting roles around again
[52:33] but one thing about it this time and
[52:36] we're on the verge of the rapture again
[52:38] y'all believe that amen y'all believe it
[52:41] hear me
[52:43] lord servant said when they get them to
[52:45] call shaped like eggs
[52:47] that we would have those before the
[52:49] rapture and we got them
[52:51] is that right amen he even said it
[52:54] it will come a time when a lady was
[52:56] going to be elected even president
[52:58] or vice president is that right we gotta
[53:02] is that right amen there's one more
[53:04] vision that got to be fulfilled he got
[53:06] because god probably had seven visions
[53:08] and there's only one motive he feel and
[53:10] that's with the atom bomb
[53:13] going to hit united states but between
[53:16] the time of the atom bomb falling
[53:18] is that right and this woman being
[53:20] elected uh
[53:21] president or vice president a rapture
[53:23] that's going to take place
[53:25] but the measuring stick of it that shows
[53:27] you just how close we are
[53:30] amen y'all believe it amen amen we
[53:34] we're that close and i was already none
[53:36] of those visions he had
[53:37] vision of 1933 none of them has failed
[53:41] and see if there's only one left and you
[53:43] don't want to be here when that one's
[53:44] coming
[53:46] that's when america is going to be hit
[53:47] with an atom bomb amen amen
[53:49] we see we sowed the atom bomb amen we
[53:52] going to reap it amen
[53:53] ain't because to be not to god does not
[53:56] mock whatever man so
[53:57] the shall he reap revelation 13 shows
[54:00] where we
[54:00] sowed that atom bomb when we dropped it
[54:02] on nakazaki and hiroshima amen
[54:04] hallelujah amen so we're going to get an
[54:07] atom bomb dropped
[54:08] back onto us amen but in between that
[54:10] time
[54:11] a rapture is going to take place so now
[54:14] there ain't no time to get slack
[54:16] because all right now it's running time
[54:18] now it's pressing time
[54:20] y'all believe it amen if you've got any
[54:22] issues at night jesus is here tonight to
[54:24] solve

[54:30] is present there's always power to heal
[54:32] there's always power to deliver there's
[54:34] always power to set free amen
[54:36] is that right there's always power to to
[54:39] purge out our heart amen
[54:41] amen so if you got any issues tonight
[54:42] amen jesus is here
[54:45] holly amen he's here
[54:49] amen i believe amen i'm crazy enough to
[54:53] believe he said what two or three
[54:54] believers
[54:55] are gathered in my name there i am in
[54:57] the midst
[54:58] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[55:01] the day
[55:01] and forever amen is that right amen i
[55:04] reminded when he got ready to send moses
[55:06] back down into egypt even he said moses
[55:09] i've heard the cry of my people
[55:11] and i've come down but i'm sending you
[55:13] holiday
[55:14] amen moses said lord i can't even talk
[55:16] right god didn't paraphrase need more
[55:18] said that's just where i want you
[55:20] is that right hallelujah amen but moses
[55:23] said
[55:24] lord who shall i say send me hallelujah
[55:27] moses wanted a name that had some
[55:29] authority
[55:30] amen is that right and jesus said god he
[55:33] told moses to tell him that i am that i
[55:36] am sent you hallelujah
[55:38] amen is that right even though he said
[55:40] tell them
[55:41] i'm the same yesterday today and forever
[55:44] amen
[55:45] because jesus jehovah the old testament
[55:47] is jesus
[55:48] of the new testament amen jesus christ
[55:51] is the same
[55:51] yesterday the day and forever amen he is
[55:54] the i am
[55:56] i am is a state of being is that right
[56:00] even he's a state of being whatever you
[56:02] need him to be
[56:03] i am you need a job i am
[56:06] you need peace i am you need finances i
[56:09] am
[56:10] you need help i am he's all right amen
[56:13] hallelujah you need a husband i am
[56:15] you need a wife i am amen is that right
[56:17] whatever you need him to be
[56:19] healed amen amen he said he who comes to
[56:22] god must believe
[56:23] that he is hey man whatever you need him
[56:26] to be
[56:27] he is all right amen that's us jesus he
[56:30] god is a state of being amen
[56:32] that why they say god heals love
[56:36] is that right it's a state of being amen
[56:40] he always is love is that right
[56:43] he never had he's always loved amen is
[56:46] that right
[56:46] it may he even love the young rich ruler
[56:49] amen that turned down eternal life
[56:52] but god looked at me and said the bible
[56:53] said god looked at him he loved
[56:56] but god knew he was going to turn him
[56:58] down even he knew judah was going to go
[57:00] don't go on betraying but he looked at
[57:02] jesus he still called him friend
[57:05] hallelujah amen because a friend should
[57:07] love at all time
[57:09] do you have an issue of not loving at
[57:11] all times do you have an issue of not
[57:13] loving
[57:14] it man search your heart amen is that
[57:16] right ain't
[57:17] nothing to go in that rapture but
[57:18] perfect love is that right
[57:20] amen nothing but perfect love amen
[57:23] hallelujah
[57:24] and it's a test on us right now amen i'm
[57:27] just
[57:27] speaking to you as a black bride with
[57:29] this racism
[57:30] it's it's a test on us that we can still
[57:33] love
[57:34] even though it's a man may hurt you just
[57:36] because of your color of your skin
[57:38] is that right but we as a black bride we
[57:40] still got to live anyway
[57:42] is that right it may cause forgiveness
[57:44] requires forgiveness
[57:46] is that right jesus said if you don't
[57:47] forgive me in that trespass and neither
[57:49] will i forgive you or your trespass
[57:51] even therefore forgiveness requires
[57:53] forgiveness hallelujah
[57:56] amen right amen because if you don't
[57:58] forgive somebody they're going to grow
[58:00] up into a root of bitterness
[58:02] is that right and if the rule of
[58:03] bitterness grow up in you then you're
[58:04] going to be defiled hallelujah
[58:06] ain't nothing defiled is going in the
[58:08] rapture amen
[58:09] amen is that right amen hallelujah god
[58:12] we got to be that
[58:13] amen we've got to be the word amen god
[58:16] has
[58:17] sent the revelation to god's word amen
[58:19] amen the bible said
[58:20] zechariah 14 to 7 i believe it here amen
[58:23] say there come a time we're going to be
[58:25] neither day no night but in evening time
[58:28] it shall be light hallelujah
[58:31] amen is that a rise and shine before so
[58:34] your light has come
[58:35] amen is that right and the glory of god
[58:37] is written upon you amen
[58:38] but you ever thought about what came out
[58:40] of that light
[58:43] what came out of that light the
[58:45] revelation
[58:46] of jesus christ what came out of that
[58:49] light
[58:50] the name of jesus christ what came out
[58:53] of that light
[58:54] the true revelation of the true baptism
[58:56] of jesus christ
[58:58] right amen y'all believe it what else
[59:01] came out of that light huh
[59:02] that we we know that hell is not eternal
[59:04] hallelujah
[59:05] right well that's coming out of light we
[59:07] know that israel was blinded
[59:10] for our sake right amen when you see the
[59:13] pictures of the holocaust
[59:14] even that revelation struck me one day i
[59:17] saw these bodies stacked up like cord
[59:19] wood right there
[59:19] where they had killed them in ospreys in
[59:21] all those places amen
[59:23] and starved them to death and to pile
[59:26] their bodies up
[59:27] like wood i looked at it one day i said
[59:30] lord jesus
[59:33] they'll pile up like that for me is that
[59:36] right
[59:37] because jesus blinded their eyes that
[59:40] would they would not recognize him
[59:42] that we might have a right to the tree
[59:44] of life is that right
[59:46] hallelujah amen yes it did is it right
[59:49] amen holiday paul clinton when you know
[59:52] they had that custom on the day where
[59:54] they would deliver
[59:55] release one man one man on that day of
[59:59] deliverance and they asked him to who
[1:00:00] shall i just
[1:00:02] deliver unto you they said barabbas
[1:00:06] he said well then what shall i do with
[1:00:07] jesus which is called christ
[1:00:10] he said crucify him amen
[1:00:13] is that right he said his blood be on us
[1:00:16] and on our children one of the biggest
[1:00:19] mistakes the jews could have made is
[1:00:20] that right
[1:00:21] amen because from then on they've been
[1:00:23] persecuted all around the world amen
[1:00:25] during world war ii amen hitler
[1:00:27] mussolini amen even stalin
[1:00:30] amen persecuted the jews amen they may
[1:00:33] kill them by the thousands
[1:00:34] by the millions hallelujah amen but they
[1:00:37] went through all of that
[1:00:39] for you and i amen because if they had
[1:00:42] recognized him which
[1:00:44] israel was taught to recognize their
[1:00:46] prophets is right
[1:00:47] amen amen because the little woman that
[1:00:50] samara she she recognized
[1:00:52] is that right amen the woman when he
[1:00:54] spoke he did that discernment to her
[1:00:56] even is that right
[1:00:58] anybody said go and get your husband
[1:00:59] says that i have none he said you have
[1:01:00] rightly said you have five and one
[1:01:02] you're with now
[1:01:02] and not josh he said sir i perceive that
[1:01:05] you are
[1:01:06] a prophet i'm just preaching that you're
[1:01:08] a messiah because we know that when
[1:01:10] messiah comes he gonna do that
[1:01:12] hallelujah amen so if jesus hadn't
[1:01:15] blinded the
[1:01:16] eyes of those jews they would have
[1:01:19] recognized him
[1:01:21] and we gentile dogs wouldn't have a
[1:01:23] right to the tree of life
[1:01:25] but god in his rich mercy and his grace
[1:01:29] blinded the apples of his eye that we
[1:01:32] made
[1:01:33] gentile dogs may have a right to the
[1:01:36] tree of life
[1:01:37] amen is that right i thank god for his
[1:01:40] mercy
[1:01:41] thank god for his grace is that right
[1:01:44] amen i thank him amen
[1:01:46] that he loved me so much it meant that
[1:01:49] he was blind the apple of his
[1:01:50] eye that i might have a chance a right
[1:01:53] to the tree of life amen
[1:01:54] amen that's why god amen even now
[1:01:56] hallelujah even he
[1:01:58] god he don't hate us sinner is that
[1:02:01] right
[1:02:02] he only hated a sinner because a senator
[1:02:04] refused to accept the pardon
[1:02:06] that he's given to him amen is that
[1:02:09] right amen because we was all born in
[1:02:11] sin
[1:02:12] shaving the neck would come in the world
[1:02:13] speaking lies is that right
[1:02:15] amen but god made a way that we can get
[1:02:18] out of being the sinner amen
[1:02:19] but what upset god is when a man choose
[1:02:21] to remain a sinner
[1:02:23] even after he made a way of escape
[1:02:25] hallelujah
[1:02:26] in the name of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:02:29] jesus christ's name
[1:02:30] i love him amen hallelujah bride of
[1:02:34] jesus christ
[1:02:35] amen god blinded them jews that's why we
[1:02:38] know what came out of the light the
[1:02:39] revelation that god had blinded them
[1:02:41] jews
[1:02:42] that we may have a right to the tree of
[1:02:44] life amen
[1:02:46] right amen and you know it was other
[1:02:49] mysteries
[1:02:49] and uh that's been revealed lately we
[1:02:51] won't have time to go and all of them
[1:02:53] even
[1:02:54] but i just want to show that that's what
[1:02:56] came out of that light
[1:02:57] even one thing that came out of the
[1:02:59] light there so
[1:03:01] back to our lesson there an issue we
[1:03:03] said
[1:03:04] is a problem that needs to be corrected
[1:03:08] amen we read the script in psalm 133 say

[1:03:19] one do we have an issue of unity amen
[1:03:22] not being unified we need to join
[1:03:24] together as one amen

[1:03:28] to breathe holly
[1:03:29] you me and the holy ghost amen amen that
[1:03:32] court is hard to break is that right
[1:03:34] amen to jesus christ's name hallelujah
[1:03:36] that precious oil went in in that
[1:03:38] they pray poke that oil on ariel's head
[1:03:41] the bible said he would pull it on his
[1:03:43] head and went down to his beard
[1:03:44] even down to the him the skirts of his
[1:03:47] garment
[1:03:48] amen aaron was a high priest
[1:03:51] amen is that right aaron was the high
[1:03:54] priest and abram was anointed
[1:03:56] from the head all over his body amen
[1:04:00] amen is that right amen in jesus
[1:04:02] christ's name
[1:04:03] y'all love it amen we i'm reminded in
[1:04:06] the book of luke 17
[1:04:07] amen amen when jesus was walking through
[1:04:09] jerusalem he went through some mary and
[1:04:10] all those and they
[1:04:11] stood ten levels hallelujah standing to
[1:04:14] fall
[1:04:15] the one thing about leprosy when they
[1:04:17] got leopa got leprosy leprosy is a type
[1:04:20] of sin until we know through by
[1:04:22] revelation
[1:04:22] but if this physical leprosy they were
[1:04:25] separated from the camp
[1:04:27] they couldn't even come into the camp
[1:04:29] because of the leper say amen
[1:04:31] that's why the bible said they stood to
[1:04:32] fall off and they cried out to jesus
[1:04:34] lord have mercy on me and jesus told him
[1:04:37] to go and show yourself to the priest
[1:04:39] hallelujah
[1:04:40] amen so the ten you know how leftist he
[1:04:43] is
[1:04:44] your hands all crumpled up amen

[1:04:49] lost some of your fingers
[1:04:50] your body all disfigured is that right
[1:04:53] even
[1:04:54] your legs all drawed up but the bible
[1:04:56] said
[1:04:57] as they were walking they was cleansed
[1:05:00] but as they were walking their body
[1:05:02] began to change
[1:05:04] as they were walking their legs begin to
[1:05:06] straighten out holiday
[1:05:07] even as they're walking their feet begin
[1:05:09] to spin as they were walking
[1:05:10] their skin came clean and white like a
[1:05:13] baby hallelujah
[1:05:14] is that right amen hallelujah while they
[1:05:17] were walking away
[1:05:18] amen but one caught the revelation amen
[1:05:21] and he turned came back and bowed down
[1:05:23] and got at the feet of jesus and began
[1:05:25] to
[1:05:25] worship him hallelujah why because he
[1:05:28] caught the revelation
[1:05:29] that jesus christ was the high priest
[1:05:32] hallelujah
[1:05:32] it because leviticus 13 amen it was a
[1:05:35] high priest
[1:05:36] that pronounced a man that he had
[1:05:38] leprosy
[1:05:39] it was a high priest that pronounced a
[1:05:41] man whether he was clean is that right
[1:05:43] maybe that's why jesus told him to go
[1:05:45] show yourself to the priest
[1:05:46] amen remember one caught the revelation
[1:05:49] that jesus christ
[1:05:50] was a high priest amen so he came
[1:05:52] running back and bow down

[1:06:08] that way that faith has made the whole
[1:06:09] amen is that right
[1:06:11] why because he called a revelation that
[1:06:13] jesus christ
[1:06:14] is the high priest amen amen is that
[1:06:17] right amen jesus christ is a high priest
[1:06:19] that can be touched

[1:28:39] sick again

[1:28:42] wheelchair get up and walk out of here
[1:28:44] but you could get back in that

[1:28:55] that can ever be paid amen
[1:28:57] there's not enough money in in the world
[1:28:59] amen amen
[1:29:01] amen to buy a soul is that right a soul
[1:29:03] that works a thousand worlds amen
[1:29:06] amen because that's why jesus said soul
[1:29:07] winners they are wise
[1:29:10] amen is that right amen are you are we
[1:29:12] why so
[1:29:14] amen we're like like jesus he he told
[1:29:16] peter he said
[1:29:17] i'm gonna make you officials of me why
[1:29:20] because peters knew how to fish
[1:29:22] is that right god didn't take that
[1:29:24] fishing skill away from him
[1:29:26] amen right he just took it and start
[1:29:29] bringing in me and instead of fish
[1:29:31] is that right because you know you can
[1:29:32] you can you if you know anything about
[1:29:35] fishing
[1:29:35] you can have a good hook but that hook
[1:29:37] can be too big is that right
[1:29:40] in other words you can you can shatter
[1:29:42] the truth of that word but it's too
[1:29:44] strong
[1:29:44] that the person can't can't handle it
[1:29:46] amen so you have to use a smaller hook
[1:29:49] sometimes
[1:29:50] they mean you have to use simplicity of
[1:29:52] the word of god a lot of times amen
[1:29:54] amen amen i remember one time i shared a
[1:29:57] lesson one time a brother came up to me
[1:29:58] i know he was saying it for himself
[1:30:00] he said most brother would say that
[1:30:02] lesson that you just shared was a
[1:30:03] shallow lesson
[1:30:06] i said yeah brother but tell me where
[1:30:09] did they catch the fish yet
[1:30:11] they caught them in shallow water is
[1:30:13] that right is that right
[1:30:15] amen amen whenever fish get debris where
[1:30:17] do you come from you come to shallow
[1:30:19] water is that right
[1:30:20] and jesus said make it so simple that
[1:30:22] even the food went here hear me
[1:30:23] is that right because god is hidden in
[1:30:25] simplicity
[1:30:26] but yet revealed in the same amen
[1:30:29] hallelujah
[1:30:30] amen in jesus christ tonight y'all love
[1:30:32] him in jesus christ's name hallelujah
[1:30:35] amen so what what is any issues tonight
