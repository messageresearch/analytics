[34:33] Psalms 82.
[34:35] [Music]
[34:40] It says, "God standeth in the
[34:42] congregation of the mighty.
[34:45] He judges among the gods.
[34:48] How long will you judge unjustly
[34:52] and accept the person of the wicked?
[34:56] Defend the poor and the fatherless. Do
[35:00] justice to the afflicted and needy.
[35:04] Deliver the poor and needy. Read them
[35:08] rid them out of the hands of the wicked.
[35:12] They know not.
[35:15] Neither will they understand.
[35:18] They walk in darkness.
[35:21] All the foundations of the earth are out
[35:24] of what?
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Out of course.
[35:28] I have said ye are what?
[35:31] &gt;&gt; God.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Ye are gods and all of you are the
[35:35] children of the what?
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Most high.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Most high. God bless you. We You may be
[35:40] seated. We thank God.
[35:43] Now we know that in the beginning, God
[35:45] created man in his own image and his own
[35:48] likeness. Isn't that right?
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; So, we want to talk to you this morning
[35:52] about amateur gods. Amen.
[35:56] Uh, shake somebody hand and ask them,
[36:00] "Do you know who you are?"
[36:03] [Music]
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? Amen.
[36:09] Amateur gods.
[36:12] Amen.
[36:14] For he says, "For in a in a man, he's uh
[36:18] he's one sense a miniature
[36:22] creator. if he's a child of God because
[36:27] the spirit of God is in him who controls
[36:31] him who operates in him then you you you
[36:36] you just a miniature
[36:40] &gt;&gt; miniature creator
[36:42] &gt;&gt; you're amateur God then he and then as
[36:48] you would love to be in the presence of
[36:52] Christ and you become a part of Christ,
[36:57] then people love to become
[37:01] in your presence because you become a
[37:06] part of God, a son, a daughter of God.
[37:10] Did you ever see people that you just
[37:13] love to be in their presence?
[37:16] There's just something about them that
[37:20] just radiates
[37:22] that you just love to talk to them. And
[37:28] other people who are nice people, yet we
[37:33] don't say this unkindly,
[37:36] but you just can't hardly stay around
[37:39] them. It is because
[37:42] of the atmosphere
[37:45] that you created
[37:48] for you as a son of God and a miniature
[37:55] creator
[37:56] because you are a part of God.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] Now uh you are a part of God. You are
[38:05] amateur a little God. Amen. And he says
[38:09] here and it talks concerning the
[38:11] prophets and uh let's just look look at
[38:14] St. John 10 and he says concerning the
[38:17] prophets and so forth and Jesus here
[38:22] um I know the Pharisees and Sadducees
[38:25] and religious people of that day they
[38:28] didn't want to acknowledge
[38:31] uh Jesus amen as being the son of God.
[38:35] And that's the same way today the people
[38:37] don't want to acknowledge you know you
[38:40] know we we find that you know the
[38:43] spiritual people and people that div and
[38:48] and uh maybe spirit the spirit realm in
[38:50] the spirit world they think themselves
[38:54] to be uh uh gods you know what I'm
[38:57] saying but through the Christian the
[39:01] real sons and daughters of God are the
[39:04] real I
[39:07] They know who they are.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; But the the Satan has those people
[39:14] believing that that they are gods, but
[39:17] they are not.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Because they are speaking things that
[39:26] belong to us.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[39:31] Because we know healing is the children
[39:33] bread, right?
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So the things that uh uh the the spirit
[39:38] realm and those people that are smoking
[39:41] dope and taking drugs, they're trying to
[39:43] get into the spiritual realm and that
[39:46] they become uh uh in touch with the
[39:50] creator with the you know universe.
[39:54] They they are trying to do everything to
[39:57] enter into that channel
[39:59] to try to reach amen out for something
[40:03] that they don't know what they reaching
[40:05] for.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said because when they
[40:09] knew God, they glorified him not as God
[40:12] and became vain in the imagination and
[40:14] their foolish hearts were darkened.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? See, but they don't
[40:20] want to accept the one the only and the
[40:23] true and living God.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; So, they're reaching out for a God.
[40:28] Amen. Just like on Mars Hill. Amen. Paul
[40:32] was saying uh uh the unknown God whom
[40:36] you eagerly worship. That's right.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; That's who I'm preaching to you. Amen.
[40:41] see are often times people, amen, are
[40:45] trying to reach for something in the
[40:48] spirit realm because they know they
[40:50] they're not just here on the earth just
[40:53] to uh exist.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; So they're trying to find amen that
[40:58] spirituality. They're trying to connect
[41:00] with the spirit world because they know
[41:03] it's something that is missing in their
[41:05] life. So they're hungering and thirsting
[41:07] and if they if they have to take a
[41:09] certain drugs and they have to uh uh uh
[41:12] you know even they're getting high
[41:14] they're looking for something to to to
[41:17] make their conscious or plead their
[41:19] conscious to try to quench the thirst
[41:22] and the desire that they have and that
[41:25] only God can feel that. But they they
[41:27] they strive to have that thirst and that
[41:31] fulfillment to have that relationship
[41:33] because Amen. They know that they are
[41:35] not in the ought to be condition.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not what uh you were
[41:41] intended to be. God, you're here for a
[41:44] purpose and God has ordained. Amen. You
[41:48] has allowed you to come on earth to
[41:50] serve his purpose.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; You're here to worship God.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But man tries to become their own
[42:03] god. But as amateur gods, it's only
[42:07] identifying us as we'll get to that. Uh
[42:11] because
[42:13] when I first started
[42:16] in that, that was
[42:18] about 40 something years ago, almost 50
[42:21] years ago, I started. But it wasn't
[42:24] until the message of the hour that I
[42:26] fully understood it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when when when God
[42:34] servant Amen began to reveal this
[42:38] message and of the hour then I began to
[42:40] understand oh this is what I was dabbled
[42:43] into but I couldn't clearly uh express
[42:47] it
[42:49] but it became more it became more
[42:51] clarity more
[42:54] clear that's right
[42:56] &gt;&gt; once Amen it was broken down in
[42:59] simplicity.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; And I trust that this should be broken
[43:04] down in simplicity that you would
[43:06] understand who you are.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; If you are made in the image and the
[43:11] likeness of God. Amen. And Adam himself
[43:16] was called a son of God.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[43:21] So now if you are son of God
[43:27] then that means to that is to say look
[43:31] at somebody that means to say God is
[43:34] your father
[43:36] &gt;&gt; your father
[43:37] &gt;&gt; cuz you a son of God
[43:39] &gt;&gt; and if you're a daughter of God you
[43:41] saying that God is your father
[43:45] &gt;&gt; uh and if God is our father then we got
[43:48] to recognize that We're here for a
[43:50] purpose and that we're more than just
[43:53] existing
[43:54] &gt;&gt; to go to work or go to school and and
[43:57] learn our ABCs and algebra and calculus
[44:01] and all of that. You know, we we're here
[44:04] for a purpose.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And our greater purpose is not to go to
[44:08] school and and get an education and get
[44:10] a good job, but our greater purpose is
[44:14] that we're here to worship God.
[44:18] God has made us sons. And see, uh, the
[44:21] prophet God says he was a self-existent
[44:24] one. He was Elohim, existed by himself.
[44:27] Amen. And becoming, uh, um, Jehovah.
[44:30] Amen. He becomes a father. Amen. And he
[44:32] has a family.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So God wanted to
[44:36] express those attributes. Amen. That he
[44:40] has a family. He don't He's not existing
[44:42] by himself, but it's God and his
[44:44] children. Amen. Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; His sons and his daughters. He has a
[44:48] family.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; He had the angels to worship and now he
[44:53] has a family.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the family of God.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; We are the household of God.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; We are the children of God.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; So, you know, you're not just here,
[45:07] Amen. by Amen. You just didn't, you
[45:10] know,
[45:12] uh from um some uh theory. Amen. The
[45:16] bane theory or something God created.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a bane theory.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody don't know about Bane
[45:25] theory, but nevertheless, you didn't
[45:27] know it wasn't a big bane and all of a
[45:30] sudden you bamed out of here.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And become to be who you are.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God created man in his own
[45:38] image.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. By the spoken word of God. Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; He spoke and what he spoke he spoke
[45:47] light into existence. He spoke. Amen.
[45:51] And you were spirit man.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; And God took the clay and the dust of
[45:55] the ground and he formed man in his own
[45:58] image. So he became fleshly man. But he
[46:01] was spirit man first.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God is a what?
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. And they that worship
[46:08] him must worship him in spirit and in
[46:10] truth.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; So God Amen. in spirit man. Amen. Then
[46:15] God made a man. Amen. That he could have
[46:18] dominion over the the things of the
[46:21] earth. And Amen. And God gave him, Amen.
[46:24] the charge of the Garden of Eden.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[46:29] &gt;&gt; So you were in charge. Amen. But Adam
[46:33] and Eve had dominion
[46:36] &gt;&gt; over the fish of the sea, the birds of
[46:38] the air, over everything, over the
[46:40] earth. They were God of the earth. Now
[46:44] remember, the angels were in heaven, but
[46:46] God made man and made him God to have
[46:49] dominion over the earth. Isn't that
[46:50] right?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; You know, often times we say, "When I
[46:53] get to heaven, uh, I'm going walk the
[46:55] streets and go." But we we understand
[46:57] that John said, "I saw the holy city,
[47:00] New Jerusalem, come down from God out of
[47:02] heaven."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So heaven, Amen. the heavens and
[47:06] streets of gold and all when it's all
[47:08] over and this world earth and this
[47:10] cosmos this world order and all this is
[47:13] burnt up in ashes and everything. Amen.
[47:16] Then God Amen. after judgment and all
[47:19] the white throne judgment and all and
[47:21] after everything has come to his end
[47:23] then uh the holy city that God said I go
[47:27] to prepare for you it's going to come
[47:29] down set on the earth and this is going
[47:31] to be your heaven.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is going to restore back to
[47:37] Eden. God going to restore everything
[47:39] that Adam lost. God's going to restore
[47:41] it back to you and I.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Now in spirit realm, it already has been
[47:46] resto restored. Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; So you already have it in spirit form.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have been translated from the
[47:56] kingdom of the power of darkness and you
[47:58] have been translated into the kingdom of
[48:01] his dear son.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. There has been a spiritual amen
[48:07] translation that changes your life and
[48:11] changes your spiritual amen. Your soul
[48:15] amen your spirit man amen is no more
[48:19] trapped by sin and amen the seed of gene
[48:24] seed of God has been quickened and
[48:27] awakened amen by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[48:30] And it has come, amen, into alive, amen,
[48:35] but it lies, amen, dominant, amen. But
[48:39] when the you hear the word, the gospel
[48:42] of your salvation and you hear that God
[48:45] loves you and that he is your father.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And you take heed to that and you yield
[48:53] to that love that God Amen. That great
[48:57] fountain of love, Amen. reconnects with
[49:00] you,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; how he thought of you before the
[49:03] foundation of the world and how you were
[49:06] in his mind
[49:08] &gt;&gt; and God just didn't uh, you know, just
[49:10] didn't have to to save you by accident
[49:13] uh to bring you into the word for your
[49:15] day by accident. God knew you were
[49:18] ordained for it.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; You were predestinated to.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God for knew that you would hear
[49:26] and God knew that you would believe him
[49:29] &gt;&gt; because you had a connection somewhere.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Brothers, they're not connected, so they
[49:38] can't come.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the father has given me,
[49:43] they'll come.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Let me go to John 10. I done got
[49:48] excited.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; But uh John 10 and 30
[49:59] I and my father or what
[50:02] you know uh I was listening to a
[50:04] preacher
[50:06] and he was trying to tell the people why
[50:10] you ought not get baptized
[50:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:18] And he was all showing all kind of
[50:20] places why Jesus
[50:24] and God are not the same. But and at the
[50:27] same time when he explaining, he was
[50:30] continually say they won.
[50:34] And I said, but all he was trying to do
[50:37] is block people from being baptized
[50:40] correctly.
[50:42] Because he wasn't baptized correctly. He
[50:45] was trying to show three persons in the
[50:48] godhead
[50:49] instead of trying to so show one person
[50:53] with uh
[50:56] with attributes
[50:59] &gt;&gt; which which he would uh express himself
[51:04] as God
[51:06] above us,
[51:08] God with us and God in us.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But he said, "These are
[51:12] three distinct persons." But I want you
[51:16] to know the God that was above us,
[51:22] what he did, he changed mass. That's
[51:24] right.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Uh he he he changed forms. Often times I
[51:29] use water
[51:31] &gt;&gt; as H2O.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; H2O could be in a solid form as ice.
[51:40] Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; In liquid form, it could be water.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And in gas form, it could be steam.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:50] &gt;&gt; But all of it is what?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; H2O.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:56] &gt;&gt; So God is in a God above us is spirit.
[52:01] Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; The creator. Amen. Amen.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; God with us was Jesus Christ.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel being interpreted as God with
[52:12] us.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said without controversy in 1
[52:16] Timothy 3:16, great is the mystery of
[52:18] godliness, God was manifested in the
[52:21] flesh.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Now that was God. It wasn't three
[52:24] person. It was God.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Manifested in the flesh, justified in
[52:28] the spirit. Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. seen of angels preaching to the
[52:33] Gentiles and what
[52:36] &gt;&gt; believed on in the word and receive up
[52:38] in the what?
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That's the same God. Ain't that right?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying to you, Amen. And don't
[52:46] limit God
[52:48] &gt;&gt; and don't try to figure out God just to
[52:51] believe that he is.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that cometh to God must
[52:55] first of all believe that he is
[52:58] &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them that
[53:01] diligently what?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Seek him.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord. Amen. And you Amen. You
[53:09] can find him.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you seek him with your whole
[53:13] heart.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is here. He's available. He's
[53:17] the He He can make himself known to you.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He Amen. He can make himself known
[53:23] to you. You know, sometimes the
[53:25] challenge is Amen. I try, you know,
[53:29] sometimes we're not ready for what we
[53:31] asking God to do.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We want God to make it known
[53:36] under certain conditions.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; God, if you're real, then I want you to
[53:41] prove it to me. God don't have to prove
[53:44] nothing to you.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:48] &gt;&gt; If there is a God, then let me know. Oh,
[53:51] yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[53:54] One day you'll know.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God's on time, you don't

[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You don't tell God. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; If you can only in humility and in
[54:07] humbness, Amen. Say, "Amen. God, I want
[54:11] to know you."
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God, Amen. I need you. Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; If you Lord, if you're there and you see
[54:19] my need and my cry, Lord, I need Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; See, God see your humility and your
[54:28] humbness, but you all are proud and
[54:32] think you know something.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, I was just reading the
[54:36] other day. He said uh uh uh God uh
[54:44] the hat.
[54:47] He said something about you got a seven
[54:50] like me seven and a a fourth head

[55:00] your head.
[55:02] You know, in other words, uh, big people
[55:07] in their little intelligent, they little
[55:09] finite mind trying to put God hat on
[55:12] their head.

[55:25] your hat
[55:27] uh trying to place go your hat God hat
[55:32] on your head
[55:34] &gt;&gt; trying to place God hat on your head
[55:38] it's too big the
[55:41] your little peacock brain
[55:47] &gt;&gt; so can you imagine that God wearing your
[55:51] heart. No. Amen. God h he's too broad.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; His mind, his ways are past finding out.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; His thoughts are not your thoughts.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; So don't you try to limit God to your
[56:05] little uh uh finite mind, your little uh
[56:08] uh intelligence. God is far beyond that.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you'll never how can I by
[56:15] searching find out God?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mind ain't able to even
[56:20] understand, amen, the fullness of God.
[56:23] He said, he said, "Eyes have not seen,
[56:26] air have not heard, neither have entered
[56:28] into the heart of man the things that
[56:30] God has prepared for them that love
[56:32] him."
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; God God is so much greater than uh Amen.
[56:41] I'm a little thinking and I'm a little
[56:44] intelligent and you're trying to bring
[56:46] God down to your
[56:50] to your level.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Though he can
[56:54] condescend and he can come and be one of
[56:57] us. Amen. But amen. Even as that when
[57:02] Jesus came in the flesh, the Bible said
[57:04] he thought and not robbery to be what?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Equal with God.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Equal with God. Amen. I got to go
[57:12] &gt;&gt; back to my lesson.
[57:15] Amen.
[57:17] I said you are amateur gods.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; You little messiahes. You amateur gods.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You gods.
[57:28] Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And you got to realize to being a god
[57:32] that means should we be worshiped?
[57:36] No. We're talking about God in respect
[57:38] of
[57:40] rulership
[57:42] and having dominion.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; But not in the form that we should be
[57:46] worshiped.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; But everything
[57:53] should be subject to us.
[57:56] Amen. Because you rule and you have
[57:59] dominion. You have authority.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; So you're one that walks with authority.
[58:05] He walks with dominion and you know who
[58:08] you are. Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; It's just like the prophet said that the
[58:12] little police come out there weigh 150
[58:15] pound lift out of his hand here go
[58:17] 18-wheeler and he stops it. How does he
[58:20] stops it? He knows that he has the
[58:23] authority to do it.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So the 18-wheeler got to get on brakes.
[58:28] But if the 18-wheeler run over him, he
[58:32] going to be in trouble. Ain't that
[58:33] right? Yeah.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; See, because he got all the law
[58:36] enforcement to back him up. All of
[58:39] America to back him up. Ain't that
[58:41] right?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; So, with your authority, you got all
[58:45] heaven.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You got all the angels. You got all the
[58:49] heaven backing you up.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; In the word of God. Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God,
[1:14:41] let me see where I left off.
[1:14:45] The Jews answered him and said, "For
[1:14:48] good work stone we not, but because of
[1:14:52] blasphemy and because that thou being a
[1:14:55] man maketh thyself what?"
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; God. God.
[1:15:01] Amen. Jesus answered them, "Is it not
[1:15:05] written in what?"
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Your law.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; So, we read Psalms 82. Is it not written
[1:15:09] in your law? I say what?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Your gods.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Your gods. And if he called them gods,
[1:15:18] unto whom the word of God came to the
[1:15:20] prophets. Amen. The word comes to the
[1:15:22] prophet. Amen.
[1:15:25] And the scriptures cannot be what?
[1:15:28] broken.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Broken.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Say ye of him whom the father has
[1:15:34] sanctified and sent into the world. Thou
[1:15:37] blasphe because I say I am what?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; The son of God.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I am the son of God. Amen. Because I say
[1:15:45] I'm the son of God. Amen. Again,
[1:15:51] do you know who you are?
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:57] If you don't know who you are, Amen.
[1:16:00] then you can act any kind of way.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; The devil can have you doing all kind of
[1:16:06] crazy stuff.
[1:16:08] Amen. The devil have an advantage over
[1:16:11] you. But when you recognize that you
[1:16:13] were here to serve God's purpose, uh
[1:16:16] we're sons and daughters of God, it
[1:16:19] makes all the difference in the world.
[1:16:21] Then I have peace of mind because I've
[1:16:23] recognized why I'm here and I'm here to
[1:16:26] praise and worship God.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm here that God might get the glory.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm on my test.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And I cannot rest
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; because I'm being tested here.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm tried and I'm test. He said,
[1:16:43] "And knowing that the trying of your
[1:16:45] faith is more precious than gold."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you go through your tests and
[1:16:50] your trials, you just know that God is
[1:16:53] working something to my good.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here. Amen. Praise God. I'm on
[1:16:59] the journey and nothing I I go through
[1:17:01] going to make me less than what God said
[1:17:04] I am.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a child of God in my
[1:17:08] struggles.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God when it's raining.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God when the sun is
[1:17:14] shining.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God in my pains. I'm a
[1:17:19] child of God in my troubles,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; he's still my God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; yet I trust him.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory, hallelujah." Anyhow,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; God, I love you.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; I love you in spite of what I'm going
[1:17:37] through.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love you, Lord.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; If I ain't got no money, I still love
[1:17:42] you.
[1:17:43] Hey, if I don't know how things going to
[1:17:46] come out, Lord, I still love you.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; I still say you're my God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise you anyhow.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; I'mma praise you. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "If I can't say a word,
[1:17:59] I'll just raise my hand."
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; You got to learn who once you know who
[1:18:08] you are.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You can maintain your integrity. Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be like Joe said, "I know
[1:18:15] that my redeemer live."
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I'm all right anyhow.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somehow. Amen. I'm going to make
[1:18:23] it anyway.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some way, somehow, I'm going to
[1:18:27] make it.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:32] We got to
[1:18:37] God is
[1:18:40] so spoke to us concerning who we are and
[1:18:45] I ain't going to be long. That's why I'm
[1:18:48] about to close cuz if I get in the
[1:18:51] second half then I'll be long.
[1:18:55] So I better cut it off short. But I want
[1:18:59] I hope I said enough.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That you would take a occasion to
[1:19:04] examine yourself
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and recognize that I am truly blessed.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I'm truly blessed to to hear God's
[1:19:14] voice, for him to speak to my heart and
[1:19:17] me to repent of my sins and be baptized
[1:19:20] in Jesus Christ's name and for him to
[1:19:23] give me his spirit.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm truly blessed to have that
[1:19:27] opportunity and I'm glad that I I was
[1:19:31] able to surrender and yield when I
[1:19:34] heard.
[1:19:36] I'm glad that God gave me the mind and
[1:19:39] the will to do his bidding
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; and to please him because in time past
[1:19:48] the Bible said we were disobedient
[1:19:50] children and we didn't you know children
[1:19:53] he called us children of wrath. Are you
[1:19:56] with me?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; But now we're no more children of wrath.
[1:20:00] He calls us sons and daughters of God.
[1:20:03] Oh, one more time. Can I get it one
[1:20:06] more?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. First John 3.
[1:20:10] Who are we?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; First John 3.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:17] Do you know who you are?
[1:20:20] I'm an amateur God. I'm a little God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And God gave me dominion over the
[1:20:30] Amen.
[1:20:32] First of all, we got to bring our bodies
[1:20:34] in check.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you something. If you
[1:20:40] don't bring this body in check, you want
[1:20:41] to you going to be led by Hollywood, the
[1:20:44] prince and power of the air. You want to
[1:20:46] be uh Beyonce and
[1:20:50] who that
[1:20:53] one of these. What the men
[1:20:56] name one of them? Tupac. That's too old.
[1:21:00] [Laughter]
[1:21:04] somebody.
[1:21:07] But if you know who you are, you don't
[1:21:09] have to identify with that world.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; You have a son of God identity. You want
[1:21:16] to be like Christ.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You have a daughter of God mentality.
[1:21:20] You want to be like Sarah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know you're sons and
[1:21:26] daughters of God. You're children of
[1:21:27] Abraham. Amen.
[1:21:30] So you want to be a child of God. So you
[1:21:31] don't take on the identity of the world.
[1:21:34] You take on the identity of holy women
[1:21:38] and you take on an identity of sons and
[1:21:41] daughters of God.
[1:21:43] And that's your identity because you
[1:21:46] know who you are. I want to behave. I
[1:21:49] want to dress. I want to my condition,
[1:21:52] my attitude, my character to be like
[1:21:54] his.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I look in the Bible, I can
[1:22:00] identify with those sisters that was in
[1:22:02] the Bible. I look in the Bible, I can
[1:22:04] identify with those brothers that was in
[1:22:06] the Bible. And I want my life to
[1:22:08] reflect. Amen. Like their life and they
[1:22:12] stood for God. I want to stand for God.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; They live for God. I want to live for
[1:22:16] God. Why? Because I'm here not just to
[1:22:20] exist. I'm here for a purpose. Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; It says in three, he said, "Behold what
[1:22:27] manner of what?"
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Love the father has. What?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; See, God's a love. That That's what we
[1:22:36] That's what we're feasting on. We are
[1:22:38] feeding on. It's the love of God. The
[1:22:41] father
[1:22:43] that we should be called the what?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Sons of God.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's who you are. Your sons and
[1:22:50] daughters of God. that we shall be
[1:22:52] called. That's what we should call your
[1:22:54] sons. God bless you, sister. God bless
[1:22:56] you, brother. We're sons and daughters
[1:22:58] of God of the utmost. Not not just
[1:23:02] people say, "I'm a part of a member of
[1:23:04] bride tabernacle." No, you're a member
[1:23:06] of the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; For one spirit, you're baptized into one
[1:23:10] body,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and that's the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Bride tabernacle means nothing,
[1:23:16] but the body of Christ means everything.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is your father. Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; It says
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; that we should be called the sons of
[1:23:33] God. Therefore, the what?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; World knoweth.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; The world knows us not because it what?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; What you mean the world don't know you?
[1:23:46] Okay. The world don't know that you're
[1:23:48] sons and daughters of God. They'll never
[1:23:50] believe it. Are you with me, D'Angelo?
[1:23:53] The world will never believe it. Your
[1:23:56] friends will never believe it. No, I
[1:23:58] don't believe it. My You know when you
[1:24:00] get saved, what do they say? I don't
[1:24:03] believe you. Your family members tell
[1:24:05] you, "I don't believe that." No.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:10] The friends, you know, lovely young lady
[1:24:14] used to talk. Uhhuh. Not you.
[1:24:17] That fell. Oh,
[1:24:21] because they can't understand that that
[1:24:24] that that you are the same. You look the
[1:24:27] same. You
[1:24:29] but you you you're sons and daughters of
[1:24:32] God. What changed you?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; What? How come you were that a few weeks
[1:24:38] ago, uh, a few months ago, and now you
[1:24:42] coming, you reading a what? A Bible.
[1:24:44] They don't understand that. The world
[1:24:47] don't know you.
[1:24:50] Amen. And they can't understand you
[1:24:52] because they didn't know who Jesus was,
[1:24:54] did they? They they call, "Oh, you're
[1:24:57] the prince of devils. No, you ain't."
[1:24:58] No, no, no, no, no. You're no son of
[1:25:01] God. You're not the son of God. And and
[1:25:03] the people say, in other words, they
[1:25:05] say, "You're not you're not a son." No.
[1:25:07] No. No. And if they can convince you
[1:25:10] that you're not, then you'll go back and
[1:25:12] do the things you used to do and live
[1:25:15] like you used to live because they
[1:25:17] convince you that you're not. And no,

[1:25:24] hear enough and you listen to them
[1:25:26] enough, the next thing you know, you you
[1:25:29] you you

[1:25:32] said.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; The old man will come back.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you'll find yourself walking
[1:25:37] in your old habits.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; But you got to recognize, no, no, I
[1:25:42] don't care what y'all say. I don't want
[1:25:44] to hear y'all voice.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm getting from around all this
[1:25:49] negative stuff. And I'm not going to
[1:25:52] listen. I I might have to go have I I
[1:25:55] might have to tell my family, family,
[1:25:57] until I can get where I need to be, I'll
[1:26:00] see y'all later
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; because I'm on a journey now. and y'all
[1:26:04] wouldn't understand my journey.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; But I I don't want to separate from
[1:26:08] y'all, but I got to separate for Amen.
[1:26:11] for the kingdom's sake.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Because I'm on a journey. And when I get

[1:26:17] y'all.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; But right now, I'm on my spiritual
[1:26:20] journey.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And when you on your spiritual journey,
[1:26:24] you can't take no baggage with you.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You might love them, but you can't take
[1:26:29] them with you. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; You got to say this journey that I'm on,
[1:26:32] I got to know God
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; for myself.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, I got it. He said
[1:26:42] the world knows knows us not because it
[1:26:45] knew him not. Beloved, he says what?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; The second verse. Beloved, what
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; now?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; When

[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; heaven,

[1:27:05] God and it does not yet appear

[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Like him.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; For we shall what?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; See him as he is.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're on that journey, brother,
[1:27:25] sister.

[1:27:34] for. I'm not just existing to go to
[1:27:37] work, get a good job, and you know, have

[1:27:42] a greater purpose, and that is to serve
[1:27:44] the living God
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; and to worship him. God bless you. Let

[1:28:29] into his image.

[1:28:36] image which Adam had in the beginning
[1:28:39] which Eve had. Your eternal destiny.
[1:28:43] You're coming back to be more than flesh
