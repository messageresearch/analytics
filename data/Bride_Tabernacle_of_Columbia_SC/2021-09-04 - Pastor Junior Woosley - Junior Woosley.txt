praise the lord isn't god good praise the lord [Music] let me hold on to that one for just a minute let me hold on for this this one for just a minute if you don't mind praise the lord there was a song i heard the other day and it just blessed my heart as brother brooks said the other night we were being called to a higher calling than we ever have been before how many amen come on thank you thank you and plan this quite much tonight praise the lord we don't have to pull the amens out of you praise the lord it's supposed to be the other way you're supposed to be pulling up here praise the lord [Music] amen but we're called to a higher calling and the point is is a lot of people don't never recognize that the resurrection's inside of them it's already here you say brother general where's the rapture it's right inside of you we're just waiting for the body change praise the lord and so kathy said our son gets somewhere sometimes e flat sometimes d somewhere around there praise the lord i walk by the tomb of buddha looked inside and saw his bones i traveled on to see my homies wrapped up in his grave clothes then i journeyed to the garden where old joseph left him lay god's precious lamb god's own begotten no longer in the grave and if you knew him like i know him you would know that he's alive oh if you felt him like i feel resurrection [Music] [Applause] deep inside you know he's living and death had died if you're one dream in the darkness come and step into the light [Applause] reach out this morning for you to pull you safe from death to life friend i too have been where you stand could i trust in things not seen [Music] but just one step in his direction then in love he ran to me [Music] oh if you knew him like i know him you would know that he's alive oh if you failed him like i feel him resurrection deep inside you know he's living and death had stopped if you knew him like i know him you would know that he's alive oh if you failed him like i feel him resurrection deep inside you know he's living and death has died hallelujah praise the lord i'm not much of a singer but that kind of lights my fire a little bit man to think that the resurrection is living inside of me hallelujah let me get rid of this one now becomes a pacifier when i'm singing so praise the lord they ask i believe brother steve shelley one time why he liked to carry the pacifier past the microphone on time he said because it has become a pacifier to me amen praise the lord if you will turn in your bible to isaiah now i'm going to tell you this this bottle of water you somebody better get it back up because they it might be sweating with the oldies this morning praise the lord because when you start preaching you can't help but get excited is that right when the word of god when you know that you know that you know and the word of god starts coming forth you know i was standing this morning and and i was combing my hair and the barber that that i used to use he got coveted and he once he recovered he he went back to honduras and uh his new guy cut my hair and boy i mean i mean he just about scalped me and i'm saying god it wouldn't lay down nothing it was like porcupines you know praise the lord and and so i'm sitting there i'm saying i look in the mirror and i said these kids are going to think that i look like alfalfa and then i i thought wait a minute these kids probably don't know what alfalfa is and then i realized my god you know when i was 18 years old i had things i could identify with every every young person under this tent with because i was still young then i turned about 28 and i had children of my own and so i was still being able to identify with you through my children i knew some of the needs that you have but then my kids grew up and we've left with one standard that we can have fellowship with this morning and that's the only way that you can identify with me and i can identify with you and we have the same god jesus christ is that right and if you're not identifying with jesus you certainly won't be able to identify with me this morning amen praise the lord if you will turn in your bibles to isaiah the first chapter i got a question to ask everyone here did you get what you expected did you get what you expected praise the lord we we've heard that it's we get what we expect you know but i found that statement to be sometimes true and sometimes not because hey i i've i i've went into restaurants and ordered a a steak and was expecting one about that size and got one this size instead so i didn't get what i expected did i but let me tell you if you fully expect god will never go back on his word praise the lord isaiah 1 18. everybody got it say amen come some of the most familiar scriptures in the word of god come now and let us reason together sayeth the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they may be red like crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord have spoken it father god we've read a portion of your word education affords that to us that we can we can set and open the pages of your word and read it lord but dear god it takes more than education to open it to us lord and lord that's where we stand in this last day god we need an opening lord father god our eyes need to be healed of the blindness lord jesus and we can see it to your word deeper than we've ever seen god come dear god in the name of jesus lord god i believe with all of my heart that you sent me here lord and i believe with all of my heart god that there's somebody that needs your word this morning now god you come and do your own preaching lord lord let me hide behind the shekinah glory of god and let them see you lord in jesus name we thank you dear god amen praise the lord amen you can be seated you know very few times in life will you ever be invited to a court for something good you know in the state of virginia how many how many 16 year olds we got any 16 year olds we got praise the lord anybody that's 15 years old 15 years old 14 years old hi we got some 14s there's a big event in this man's life right here this young man's life is coming in the state of virginia if he lived in the state of virginia because that when he turns 15 and eight months he can go and apply for a learner's permit and he can go behind the and get inside the the car with as long as he has a licensed driver over 18 years old in the car with him and he can drive and then when he turns 16 he can take the actual test and receive his his driving permit but he doesn't receive it right away in the state of virginia there's one time that you can come to the judge free of charge and let me tell you i've seen them do it different ways in the state of virginia but a judge will present to you your driver's license in the state of virginia when you turn 16 years old you know and so every every 16 year old that has their driver's license state of virginia has stood before the judge one time or the other you say brother that's not a big event oh yeah when you turn 16 years old you know you'll know about it some of us remember that 16 years old now one judge played the trick to him and he laid all the driver's license on a big table in front of him and he called instead of calling the child he called the parent to come and get the driver's license and he said i want to give you i'm investing in each one of you parents the right to pull these driver's license at any time you deem necessary that was rough you know but it was it was okay you know but i can imagine if i was 16 years old i'm sitting there saying oh no i thought they were mine so see no good thing comes normally when you're called before the court but when you look into the original greek on that scripture come now let us reason together it means come to the judgment seat and let us reason together praise the lord he's inviting you to a place to where you can approach his judgment seat in neutral see he doesn't find you guilty he doesn't find you innocent he says come and let us reason together and if you plead your case right now you'll never have to stand before me again as judge do you realize there's oodles of people that are called to the judgment seat of god and they walk away with less than what they expected because people don't like to go before a judge period they get nervous you know and they want the easy way out they want the easy way out and sometimes the judge says it's not an easy way praise the lord is that right but one thing for sure we're all going to stand before a judgment seat romans 14 and 10 you don't have to read have to turn to it but it says but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost dog and and uh said it not thy brother and that means to make him utterly nothing in that terrible that a child of god would make a fellow brother utterly nothing for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ we all will stand there i've decided that i want to stand before judgment day because when he calls that courtroom that day he doesn't have any positive sentences to pass out but right now he's invited me to come to that judgment seat and reason with him and say hey god i realize i need you i realize that if this was judgment day i would not have a good intention that you might brush me off into that lake of fire see so what did we ask for you know how many has been already been to the judgment seat one time huh how many has been to the judgment seat now i'm not seeing no hands dear god help me maybe i'm barking up the wrong tree here i i would say every one of you have been to the judgment seat and the primary thing that's on our hearts when we approach that judgment seat is that we are a sinner and we need forgiveness because after all he did say though your sins be a scarlet they will be white as snow and so we come and we ask god forgive me how many how many has ever asked for forgiveness come on participate with me come on young people praise the lord it don't hurt you to raise your hands let god know you're still alive all right you know that you're amongst the livingston that you ain't passed out praise the lord we had a couple of of them little kids at youth camp past clean out in the spirit you know and the other ones had never seen 10 through 13 year olds is what i was dealing with and the others had never seen anybody slain in the spirit i went my god where are we coming to all right see but we all stand and we ask for forgiveness you know and we say thank god i believe that my sins are forgiven thank the lord you know and we walk away and what we expected was deliverance what we got was we got our sins forgiven but what we didn't get was what we expected because the first time that i ever went to that throne and that judgment seat i was expecting for deliverance that when i got it from that altar i would walk away and i wouldn't be the same i wouldn't have the same temptations i wouldn't want to cuss every other word come on saints because i was expecting to change brother simmons but what i got was my sins forgiven and i said wow my sins are clean man man i i i might even did it a little dance i used to do a dance a lot of times can you believe that 312 pounds can dance absolutely when the power of god hits him he sure can you know and so here we are we're standing there and we're saying oh thank god my sins are gone we sing that song they're underneath the blood but the problem is i walked right out of the church door here comes a girl down the street practically nothing on and here comes my thoughts wait a minute if my sins forgiven i'm not changed i'm still having the same identical thoughts and let me tell you that just about caused me to give up and it has on a lot of message kids because they're expecting a change and their sins are forgiven and they can feel the cleanliness of the holy ghost washing away all of those sins but then when they get outside there hadn't been a change they're still wanting to watch the same old pornography before you know they're still wanting to smoke the same dope they're still wanting to do everything that they used to do and like i said i said my god wait a minute if this is all it is do i have to keep coming up to that altar every every day and and lay before and say god please forgive me please forgive me wash my sins wash my sins wash my sins because what if he comes just after that good looking girl goes by what if he comes after just after that good looking guy goes by what if he comes after you looked at your mama and defiantly say i will not clean my room up because the bible plainly says if you die in your sins where i am you cannot come this is a little bit different than what i normally bring forth in them see but that scripture we leave that next scripture out if you be willing and obedient wait a minute preachers are preaching that first one oh though your sins be scarlet they shall be white as snow come let me cleanse but they forget to tell you hey there's something that has to continue happening and you have to become willing because if you don't become willing then you'll walk away with forgiving sins praise the lord see you leave this the rejoi the oh oh you're you're saying hallelujah hallelujah my sins are gone but did you get what you expected because you expected a change and you you go away and you say oh thank god my sins are gone but have you changed see did you become willing see because when you become willing something has to break on the inside you know how many how many realizes that you were born selfish come on saints i don't know about you but the reason that baby's crying is not because he wants his mom and dad to have the bottle he's got crying because he wants his mom and dad to to get a diaper come on they were born we are born as selfish individuals we want what we want and we find how to be political about it because you start realizing wait a minute wait a minute you know at first it's selfish it's all me and then mom and dad's actually handsome play with your little sister now come on you know what do you mean you bit little johnny you know here comes the soap yeah because why you're selfish but pretty soon you start getting political about this stuff you start realizing wait a minute if i manipulate yeah i can get the best truck in the sandbox you know come on sites if i manipulate maybe i'm not the best but if i manipulate i can get what i want and let me tell you you know what daddy in here that has about a 14 year old girl that comes to him says daddy she's learned to manipulate you she's got you tied around her finger and i'd be proud of it if i were you because she's got her efforts been towards you and not some guy out there because if you don't pay attention to her somebody is somebody is see so i want everybody to say this morning lord i want what i expected that ain't good enough say it louder lord i want what i expected now hold that thought turn in your bibles to saint john the third chapter is everybody get anybody getting bored yet amen this is a little more difficult to to do out here and you say why brother jr because that step right there i can't get down there with y'all like i like to amen praise the lord how many realizes something has to happen for your will because you're selfish your will is for you to be blessed you know and we keep a certain amount of that believe it or not because we would never be blessed because i want to see my brother blessed the other night when brother isaiah and last night when brother leggett was preaching i wanted to see them blessed but don't you think i wasn't saying god don't forget saturday morning be here because i'm gonna be here see and i knew the same god that was with them would meet me here so some of that you need to keep but most of it needs to die nicodemus comes and he asks the million-dollar question how did i get into this thing and i don't know how many of you have stood studied about the book of john let me ask you a question how many here can quote john 3 16. how many can quote john 3 16. i'm seeing probably 20 people anymore all right you know why because it's one of the most popular verses in christianity for god so loved the world why brother junior why why is it not john 3 3 that is more important because john 3 16 takes us doing nothing just believe but john 3 3 takes a death see for for some of y'all that may not know the book of john was actually he wrote that after the book of revelations and that's why he didn't start it with so-and-so but god so and so so and so but god so and so so and so but got that because when john stood there he said in the beginning was the word because he had a revelation of who it was i'm sorry i've been got off on adults forgive me see and so here they are here he stands there nicodemus is wanting how do you get into this thing you know and a lot of people ask that question and we say just believe john 3 3 jesus answered and said unto him early i say unto thee accept a man be born again and to uh be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of god now we brother brother simmons so you know i'm sitting here saying man they're preaching my message they might as well just go on to do it you know brother simon setting up here last night he said what was the holy ghost see the kingdom of god is the holy ghost and he says he says you can't even see the holy ghost until you're born again but wait a minute brother junior i danced i jumped i leaped i ran but when i went back outside that tent i was doing the same identical things you didn't see the holy ghost it kind of fell on your flesh as brother brooks said the cockaburg because i got a quote on that you know that cockerborough frat flesh it might have fell on that but you ain't been born again later on jesus says that you can't enter into the holy ghost without being born again see see when we approached god for forgiveness we came in the nature that we were born with our selfless nature you know you brothers and sisters do you ever fight tell the truth tell the truth all right how many times in a week just in a week five times all right do you concur with that at least five or more all right he says five do you ever fight with your brother yeah why they just happen to be setting up here y'all kids are hid back air amongst you huh why do you fight because you want something you want it your way i can tell you why kids fight they want it their way and if they don't get it their way why because they were born with a selfish nature on them and and jesus said you're telling nicodemus you want to enter into the kingdom be borne again get rid of that old nature and get a new nature he says then you will change is that what he said see because you can't enter into the kingdom of god you can't even look on the kingdom of god see ephesians 2 3 says among whom also we all had our conversation in times past so i want to tell you your mom and dad used to argue with their brothers and sisters too all right in the lust of their flesh fulfilling what the desires of the flesh and the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others see all about us have you ever seen somebody that goes to church that has not had a new birth watch them it's going to be that's going to be the biggest complainer in the church the music's too fast the music's too slow it's too loud it's too soft it's too hot it's too cold why because you're selfish you know all you have to do if you pastor for a while you'll figure out you know but that child of god that comes in and says i don't care if icebergs form on my nostrils i'm going to worship god that's the one that's had some kind of change on the inside oh there goes my nose and unfortunately with my age i gotta have him it used to be i didn't have to have praise the lord see yeah now watch we have how many realizes the reason our desires didn't change was because we didn't want to become willing to change that's the key it's not a great big revelation because if you want to change you will change i think it was back in 2018 i think it was i decided i don't want to weigh over 400 pounds anymore and i started working on it and i've lost 100 pounds because i don't want to be that way no don't clap it's all god see but something on the inside of me said i don't want to do that anymore now i watch what i eat you know careful with what i choose great revelation ain't it so so difficult everybody has such a hard time no not if you really want because this is the part of selfishness that you're supposed to keep i want something and it's not a new car it's not a new house it's not a new toy it's not a new bicycle it's not a new pair of of tennis shoes that cost 350 dollars it's one thing it's one simple thing jesus that's all i want [Music] i have become willing and now i can eat in the good of the land i can receive the holy ghost because i've laid my desire on the altar see christ set an example in that garden that a lot of people do not realize because how many realize he was in the flesh just like we are there was something in him that rose up it wasn't sin see that's why i say you can keep that selfishness it was a sin you know it was his will had to break that's what the prophetess god said his will cracked in half and he said lord nevertheless let it be thine will and not mine you sitting there you know you girls and and i've worked with young people since i was 18 years old like i said and i ain't telling you how old i am now but i got gray hair ain't right and so i've pretty well seen just about every trick in the book i think every once in a while one surprises me a little girl 17 years old come to the altar week her eyes out i mean a puddle of tears surely surely brother junior she got a new birth she wore her long dresses one day to school i can tell you this girl's name brother isaiah brooks may be able to remember her because she repented under his ministry and all the kids t's tc's oh grandma that that you know how they do you know because it's become bullying now rather than just teasing they start being vindictive over because they're devils and see and so we don't know what sometimes if we're sending kids to public school what we're sending them to but anyway the next day she found actually she had already gotten rid of all of her her her shorts and her her her pants and stuff so she borrowed a pair put them in a bag went down to the corner where she caught the bus it was a filament station went into filling station put her pants on took her skirt off had she had a new birth you know because see new births cause you to own up to what's inside mama and daddy i got a problem i'm still pulled to those things i need to die out but instead what did she do she hid it away next revival meeting here she's there at the altar weeping and crying and see some other people word had already gotten back to me i was the youth leader at that time and and word had already gotten back to me what she was doing and i'm praying and going god do i expose this to the to the parents do i what do i do with this you know next revival comes along and she's up there weeping and crying again and she never i bet she she went to that altar 50 times that i've known that young lady and today she's a drug addict and the reason why because she never would have a new birth and finally i sat down at her with her dad you know it went on for for a few few you know a few weeks and so i sat down with her dad and her dad said i don't know what i'm going to do you know and i'm saying you better be praying you better be praying because if she don't have a new birth it's gonna go deeper and see she always feels like she can come back to that religious spirit that's waiting for her at that altar and walk away feeling as clean as clean can be is she clean absolutely because god don't lie if you ask forgiveness he's going to forgive you if you ask for cleansing he's going to cleanse you is brother junior being a little rough this morning see see well listen see knowing this romans six let's let's do this knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed now if something's destroyed you know what does that mean somebody tell me something's destroyed is it usable again can you use it oh i went to the altar and and i backslide did your old man become destroyed because that's what my bible says happens you don't have something to fall back to it ain't there no more so don't tell me you sit there and backslid you might have walked out of the grace of god but you didn't backslide not if you had a new birth man the hair on my back of my neck is standing up straight that the body of sin might be destroyed then henceforth we should not serve sin now listen for he that is dead is freed from sin amen i ain't got nothing behind me all i got heaven before me god said he destroyed it annihilated it you can't find the dna of that old body hallelujah say brother junior are you still tempted absolutely but see i realize i ain't got nothing to go back so i might as well push forward god you promise grace and i want grace help me the young people sits there and they come up here and they say i got it i got it all right let me let me get to the quote lord mercy it's already 12 o'clock so you see the same rain that makes the wheat grow makes the cocker world grow and therefore i got the picture there your carnal confessor that's right in the church but his fruit he might shout jump dance speak with tons but his fruit he's a cocker burl and there's the other one that's got the same spirit the holy spirit can drop right in a bunch of people and a hypocrite can shout by the holy spirit just the same as a cocker bird can live by the rain that sent that's what paul's speaking of here [Applause] oh brother i i don't understand the power of god i know it was the power of god to hit me but why in the world am i laying in bed with this girl that i'm not married to come on young man you say you've had a new birth why is your hands on that girl where they shouldn't be hallelujah little girl why are you letting me do it i love it there was a daddy and this type of teaching ain't going on very much these days but there was a daddy taught his girls he said if any boy even touches you he said you command them to take their your hand he said the only one should be touching you is a man of god and i said that's strong teaching well i happen to be at youth camp and here's this girl i'm coming down through old west milton camp i'll never forget this i was coming down through that little gully and over right there close to j dorm there was there was that little girl was standing there and she had like four girls around her and boys and all of a sudden it was a boy laid his hand on this girl's shoulder and i caught it out of the corner of my eye and i went oh gracious day because i know what that little girl was taught and that little girl said sir get your hand off of me he took it off of her and then he made the mistake and he put it back on the oh touch not touch me not is what he said and she left her fingerprints on the side of his face and he comes running to me did you see that brother jr i said i heard something because i knew when he reached back out what was gonna happen i turned my head i said i heard something what did i hear he said that girl smacked me i said what were you doing he said i touched her shoulder i said did she ask you not to yeah well you shouldn't have come on girls you're a child of god why in the world aren't you standing up for your rights instead of sending pictures preacher's kid sitting in a service and somebody looks over and he just receives a picture from a girl and she ain't got nothing on i said how in the world can they say they've got new bursts shouting dancing the spirit and with that kind of mess going on they ain't had no new birth he says but a real genuine christian presses towards perfection into the world is dead and you become a new creature in christ jesus that's it's impossible for that man to ever fall did anybody hear that impossible paul said he destroyed it get that old man destroyed this morning for if we would judge ourselves see we're before the judgment seat god's inviting you come come come to the judgment seat and paul says if you judge yourself you don't need to be judged god i need you that was when he turned the mic over that's what we were singing lord i need you right now but i wonder in people's minds that were setting under this tent if you were actually saying my god i need you i've got things in my life that i need to pour out before you and get rid of kill it before it multiplies that's what the bible says see how that compares with the rest of the scripture see how it lays right in there in its place he says if we judge ourselves we should not be judged wow there they go let them go this time because we're finished because god has made us overcomers there's nothing in your life that you cannot get rid of i've seen i've seen drug addicts i've seen nicotine devils countless i've seen the spirit of homosexuality delivered amen several times i've told you all this story i'm pretty sure preacher's kid i get woke up at 3 30 in the morning preacher's kid you say brother junior why does preachers kids always have such a problem it's because normally the preacher is so busy trying to save your kids i know i know i'm not blaming nobody but i'm saying preachers it's hard for us to keep our family and keep keep your family too and here's a preacher's kid brother jr i need for you to pray with me brother i know your daddy what a tremendous preacher of gospel you don't not need me to pray for you you know go get your dad and i'll pray for you he said brother junior i got something that i can't tell nobody else and when he said that i said i know where he's going because see we are in the age you say brother junior that spirit doesn't get around the message oh yes it does you know and then to that boy grew up he was 14 years old i believe 15 years old and until he grew up got married he's got children now he finally stopped emailing me and saying brother how sweet jesus christ is just as a reminder he said i just want to remind myself what god did that night it ain't nothing you can't god will destroy anything you put in front of him but are you willing see we go right back to the same question are you willing and obedient and if you're not willing and obedient then how can you ever expect to make it like i said we re we recite john 3 16 for god's who loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall have eternal life everlasting life but do we ask ourselves god am i born again has my nature died or am i just shouting in the services feeling the presence of god when it falls just like an old cocker bird growing like a weed it's up to you the altar is open this morning i don't believe god sent me clean from richmond virginia down here to preach this message because without a shadow of a doubt i believe it had to come forth this morning i know it hadn't been the shouting message that a lot of a lot of times still is delivered it's the message that starts making you examine yourself because young people we don't have very much longer just any day now i'm expecting him to split the eastern skies [Music] and what if you are not born again you you will not make it in the rapture i'm not trying to say whether you'll make it in in the church and all of that other stuff that doctrine i just leave out because i won't accept make it into the church i want to make it into wrath i've even prayed god if i can't make it in the rapture then go on to slay me now but isn't there somebody there one let's all stand you say brother junior what did that do when you stood up you got just a little more closer to taking that first step this altar is open you say brother i've had i've had i've been to that altar 50 times and i've never changed and i've heard that testimony and that's what causes me to preach this message to this morning was this year at youth camp a teenager come to me and told me brother junior i've been to the altar must have been 50 times and i leave the same way and i laid before the lord and said god you've got to give me an answer and that's what he gave me was you've not become willing do you know how hard it is to look at a teenage young man and said the reason why you're not born again is because you've not become willing isn't there somebody in here this morning that has become willing god i don't want to carry it away i've been 50 times and when i see them girls i still have those thoughts [Music] come on to the altar and say god this time i'm willing i'm laying it down i can't i ain't taking it back you're gonna destroy it right here anybody there's one always starts with one come on ain't there another one hey there another one [Music] come on young man god's meeting you here yeah that's right come on siblings come on ministers come on ain't there somebody else i leaving here the same way that i came under this tent i'm leaving with victory this morning come on anybody else there's more of you that god's dealing with but i don't go and shake your hand and pull you to the altar if you don't have enough gumption to come on your own you ain't willing yet [Music] come on [Music] anyone else [Music] [Music] burn it out [Music] god's in this house god's in his house you better let go of that god [Music] god's in this house [Music] please
