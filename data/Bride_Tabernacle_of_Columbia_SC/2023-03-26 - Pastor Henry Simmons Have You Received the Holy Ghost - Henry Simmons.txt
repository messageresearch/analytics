passed through the upper course came to Ephesus in finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost said she what bleed okay that they and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John Valley baptized with the baptism of repentance said unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of what Father Son and Holy Ghost the name of what sprinkle okay and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the what Holy Ghost came on them and they got the Holy Ghost amen and they what speak with tongues and prophesy and then all the men were about 12. God blessed to read the towards you may be seated it acts uh 18 and 24. acts 18 and 24 God is good amen amen you love the Lord amen you come into the house of the Lord for one purpose and that is to praise him the giving thanks for what he's done and when you come through the door he gonna engage with praise and be thankful to him for the Lord is good amen every time we come through the door just thank the Lord that he allowed us to come together one more time because somebody wanted to come but they were not able amen we continue to lift sister Hannah up and praise God we know that they usually listen in and God is good amen brought it through the surgery and everything and strengthening her amen God is good amen Amen brother uh Pastor brother pigeon he was just telling me how Natalie went through a whole lot but God is good too took off the respirator and all that amen I'm gonna say God is doing working miracles amen expect well you know miracles in your life if you want Miracles then expect it but if you just want to just sit around and you know accept what the devil is placed in your life and what he's put on you if you want to accept defeat then you can you know rest on that but if you believe that through Jesus Christ I can overcome whatever that comes against me through Jesus Christ and through the help of God Amen all things are possible for me praise God and I'm going to walk in those things and I'm going to believe the impossible that With God all things are possible that he's more than able to do for me praise God far more than the doctors the nurses and I can do for myself amen Hallelujah so I'm trusting God for miracles in my life amen I thank God God is a keeper you know that as we talk on the Holy Ghost this morning and I was in back in Sumter on Wednesdays and we were dealing with the baptism in Jesus Christ's name and and we thank the Lord and and maybe I'll do this person and then I'll get on a little bit about when we talk about the Holy Ghost we know that there's three stages to Grace and that's justification sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said three stages of Grace amen Grace is God a favor towards us amen and without God's grace we we have nothing amen we only here by the grace of God there's nothing that we have achieved or done and not because we were so good but it's the grace of God that we're here this morning and it's going to continually be that way it's the grace of God and we thank God for his grace amen no matter how bad our situation may look no matter what we're going through somebody's going through worse than you amen somebody with a lot to take your place amen but I thank God for his grace praise God and I know he loves me in spite of all I go through amen I know God is keeping me no matter what amen amen no matter how it looks no matter how it feels God is still good to me amen and I love him for it amen so I still trust him and I'm still thank him we always have something to praise the Lord about amen you can look at the things that's coming against it you can look at the Giants you can look at the wall cities or you can look at What God Says and Lord I'm looking at you and what your word has declared for me and Lord I Thank you for saving me salvation means everything salvation is completely of the Lord praise God salvation is of the Lord nothing that we have married nothing that we could do salvation is completely of God and if you were saved this morning it's because he loves you amen praise God this is because God why did he do it amen we'll understand it better bye it wasn't what you've done and how good you were amen and not intelligent you were is because he loves you God I don't know why he cares I don't know why I sacrificed his life with me but I'm so glad he did where would I be if he did what where would I be if he didn't where would I be we didn't sacrifice life for me how about it brother sister amen take somebody hand and say where would you be amen can you imagine where you would be some of us know where we would have been we would have been bad shape amen but thank God for caring about us now acts 18 and 24. a certain Jew named Apollos born in Alexander an eloquent man and mighty in the world came to emphasis so this man was elegant and mighty in the scripture are you a man see you can always learn somebody can tell you something no matter how powerful how Mighty you are amen somebody can tell you something and they don't have to be so my as eloquent and as mighty as you but yet they can tell you something God can let them reveal to them something that you don't know I understand but you got to be humble enough to accept when God is speaking to somebody else that's why I said let others esteem others better than themselves amen don't look on the things of yourself or things of others amen so he says this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in what spirit is Anointed it's ferving in the spirit and he speak and talked diligently the things of the what Lord knowing only the what and see it's a lot of people that know only the baptism of Father Son and Holy Ghost only the titles they when they baptized in the water this is not now baptized in the name of the father's Son and Holy Ghost oh you will they and the eloquent people mean right but they don't know the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they don't know that they should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yet what they do know amen they really amen are ferving with it amen and suppose Aquila and Priscilla approaches this man okay it's your approach to individuals that turn people off or turn them on is how you approach an individual if you think that you're better and you know more than them and you want to let let me tell you something and amen you ain't nobody don't respect them you got to give respect amen you know not try to embarrass them not try to hey I know something you don't know and you know how it is when you know something somebody don't know amen you think that you you know Head and Shoulders above them maybe you have a college degree maybe you have a master's a doctorate degree maybe you have you know a a job that's highly esteemed maybe you have money or maybe you have something and makes you a little bit amen you can look down on those that don't have as much but this man was an eloquent in description and when you got something that somebody don't have amen subconsciously your spirit could be a little lifted up because you think that you're better than somebody else amen so it's hard for you to understand you know when a man is blind amen you can't make that man see are you with me nothing you you say well that's a white car that's a black card oh that's this is Blue Man blind he can't see can't you see the light is Red Man blind can't you see uh just read this paragraph you can't he can't see and understand if our gospel behead is here to them that are what law ass whom the god in this world has what now if as you can have sympathy and you can have pity on an individual that is physically blind how much more would a spiritual blind person is before you then you should have compassion and understanding how you approach a blind person first of all amen it takes the ability of God to open the blind eyes you cannot amen the darkness make and operate and do what they can but oftentimes they come up they can't open them and same things with our hearts our hearts have to be amen penetrated by the Lord Jesus Christ because there's places inside of us amen that the doctors can't even touch amen because he don't know how to deal with the psychologist can't get it he met the psychiatrist can't get it the counselors and everything so it takes God to deal with your heart and to deal with the soul of man and to look down and to operate that that individual might be able to see or to understand the things of God so if God does not deal with that then that individual would never be able to see are you with me so your approach ought to be with a lot of compassion and a lot of understanding that this person really don't see it doesn't matter how much light amen we can put some more lights in here if a blind person is blind the light won't happen you can pile light upon light polite but if they're blind that light is not going to happen it might cause those that can see the uh see a little better but amen more light won't help a person that's blind first of all their eyes got to be open before they can absolve the light so the heart of man got to be open before he the light of God the gospel of the word of God can penetrate the heart of the Soul amen a man must be born again that is important that the Holy Ghost come in and if the Holy Ghost do not come that person will never be able to see and understand the things of God without the Holy Ghost they don't know amen it's no you should trying to make them do or trying to show them the the light of the word because they'll never see it without the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter how much it means to you amen it don't mean too much to them because they cannot see except they have eyes to see is here are you a man he said he that has ear to hear Let Him see what I'm saying if you don't have that ear to hear he can't hear oh yeah so let's let's try to understand that so your approach because uh a lot of times I approached you witnessing and talking the things of the Lord you just take for granted because you see it everybody ought to see it because you know everybody ought to know not so so he says and this man Apollos can only do what has been revealed to him now it says in the 26th verse it says he told forever and dealing to the things that knowing only the baptism of John and he spent and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla husband and wife had heard they took him unto him and expounded unto him the way of God more what perfectly let me I'm gonna try to embarrass you in front of the people can I meet with you privately and you know God has revealed this and share some things with you amen you know can I come by your house or can we meet and maybe go out to a cup of coffee or something and uh let me show you some things the Lord is revealed I like to take you out to dinner or invite you over or something let's sit down and I want to share some things with you you know and you only can feed them what they can eat are you you can't give them things that's going to choke them and expect them amen to survive are you with me but if you you see what they can eat then you can give them what they can eat there's no usually you giving them a big steak and that they can't eat it amen so you might just have to uh give them a liquid diet or something is soft something that you know they can receive see a person ain't gonna listen to you until they find out you care about them see before you can witness to a person you got they got to know you care about them and you love them because if they don't if you're not if they don't sense that you care about see because you can care about them knowing things and understanding the Bible but you don't care about me as a person then that that ain't gonna worry but if a person realize you care about them as a person then you can talk to them but if you don't and that's what I I feel like a lot of times we miss people because people don't know whether you care about them or you just want them to know what you know are trying to get them to be a part of your church or understand what you believe it may not even be for them but if you genuinely care for them amen you're just gonna care for them whether they receive it or not you still care for them you still want to be the friend and you're going to be a Christian and a brother a sister to them are you with me and then maybe later on they said that person really cared about me and they didn't try to put their religion on what they believe on me but they genuinely cared for like me as an individual and when they got a problem they might say you pray for me pray for my family pray for this situation and you continually pray for them and situations after a while they'll start communicating a little they say well you know I might visit your church you know what I'm saying I want to come amen because you're such a sweet person your light has clearly shined to them and they've clearly seen Jesus Christ in your life so it it caused them to hey you know I I like what you're getting so sometimes people can be Christians and and say but amen your life might be shining a little bit brighter then they're like and they might see hey hey you got something you know I ain't got what you got and I need what you got so he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you know I'm not taking away whether you believe or not but have you received the Holy Ghost sensibly I'm not saying you're not a Believer but I'm saying have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe okay so he says here um in the 27th verse and when they was disposed to pass unto Ikea the Brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help them much which had believed through Grace he believed how did he believe through Grace amen for he moderately convinced the what Jews and publicly showing by what that Jesus Christ that Jesus was Christ are you with me that was a powerful Revelation back in that day for somebody to receive that Jesus Christ it is so much and so that people think that an individual is not baptized in Jesus Christ that he's brought a revelation if you don't if you're not baptizing Jesus Christ and you don't have the Holy Ghost then your ball your vote of Revelation amen that God don't deal with you but this man has been dealt with amen and he had a revelation and publicly amen he was ferving in the spirit so God can deal with people Amen in in a Justified state in the spirit of God and the anointing of God can be upon their lives but one thing about it when a police came to uh it came to pass in the 19th verse or that while police were that can rent Paul haven't passed it off of course came to heavens and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you up the second verse 19-2 he said in them have you what have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now notice you can be a believable you know I believe Jesus is saved me I accepted him as my personal Savior and I believe Jesus Christ is Lord I believe he's the son of God thank God for that but have you received the Holy Ghost since then are you with me now uh oftentimes uh the the Oneness they usually baptized the emphasis is so much on baptism and the water baptism until they miss out on what really saves a man so and then they they put the emphasis on speaking in tongues until they missed out on whether a person had received the Holy Ghost see they when a person speak in tongue they think automatic that person got the Holy Ghost well he got the Holy Ghost I heard him speak in tongues and instead of praying that the person received the Holy Ghost they're praying that they receive the Holy Ghost but they're more praying that this person speak in tongues because they believe the tongues is the evidence that the person got the Holy Ghost and a lot of pers people have tarot and they said Jesus Jesus Jesus said uh hallelujah hallelujah and NFL anointed and power of God the spirit of God come on them and they feel good and they feel like they got the Holy Ghost but uh you know how do you know when you got the Holy Ghost uh you know and and people walk away with Victory they feel good and anointed and the power of God made we were working in their life for a few days in a few days after a few days the devil beating them up and they might do the same thing they used to do and they don't have any uh Deliverance power because the spirit of God and anointing of God God on them but they wasn't completely filled up amen they had a potion of the spirit and they felt the grace of God but as far as being filled they wasn't enough fluid with the Holy Ghost and sealed then or you have been disagree not the holy spirit of God whereby your seal see so one thing about uh receiving the Holy Ghost is another thing whether you sealed until the day of redemption see because a lot of times people amen they do things that are out of character they do things and they they seem to be I know you can be holy ghost have the Holy Ghost and be weak and do some things but there's always a a a a a a a a a a a a repentant spirit inside of you you're always going to repent you the devil cannot hold you down because in Acts 1 and 8 he said after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall have what power now how come amen people say well I can't overcome this I can't overcome that after the Holy Ghost come you shall have power and he said uh this is the victory that overcomes the world even our what faith amen so you overcome by the what blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony isn't that right so it's oftentimes we're trapped we're trapped in and we're not Overcomers and we don't have victory in our lives it only because amen we have been told that we have something that we don't have amen the Baptist teach that you have the Holy Ghost When You Believe but here we said have you re plead the Holy Ghost since you believe now this you see what I'm saying these individual was Believers and they were baptized by John about uh Baptists amen but they didn't receive the Holy Ghost when they bleed amen they received Jesus Christ when they believed they had Revelation and God did some things in their life but the Holy Ghost since you believe praise God but they couldn't walk in Victory in their lives they didn't have no victory amen they just yes they came to church and yes they sang on the choir yes they did but where's the victory in your life amen sometimes you know the devil knocked you down and you couldn't get up but the Holy Ghost give you power the get back up amen the Holy Ghost is not weak the devil just can't push Jesus around because great is he does what and you didn't hear that it's in the world the devil just can't push you around like you sinner your son or daughter God when you get the Holy Ghost you got power you got Authority you're walking in Victory Victory what victory over the world victory over the devil the things of the world the Holy Ghost come to give you resurrected power when he rose he rose victoriously over death hell in the grain are you with me so he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now how do you know that you really when you're walking in power because the Holy Ghost come to give you power and then not only does it give you power you should be Witnesses of me in Acts 1 and 8 You're Gonna Be A Witness if you're not witnessing no more that means you you need to get back on your knees and get re established in God you don't witness to try to bring people to Brian Tabernacle but you witness to try to bring people to Jesus Christ once you lose your ability to witness and try to win a soul to Christ then something you'll your light is going out but if you're trying to bring them to anything so I'm trying to get people to the message to the hour I'm talking about you trying to get a person to who Jesus Christ I'm trying to get them to broadcast no are you trying to get a person to Jesus Christ now God revealed the rest you get them to Jesus amen now how do you know he's uh acts 16 and um no John 16 excuse me John 16 and 13. you know you don't have to turn you can if you want to he said how big when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into what all all truth now you don't have to worry about a person believing the message of the owl or believe that God sent a prophet of different things like that because the spirit of truth will lead a person into what all truth well you concentrate oh God you can tell a person all that and they said I believe that and I believe this and and certainly they might even see it intellectually but you think it's your responsibility your main responsibility is the leader person to Jesus Christ and Let Jesus Christ do what he does best amen he's the one that gives Revelation he's the one to open people's eyes amen because you can't do it if you do it amen if something happened to you they gone are you with me because they look into you they

persuaded this way that way amen it's a lack of the Holy Ghost preachers preaching but they don't have the Holy Ghost amen that's why they're all in confusion and chaos and somebody come out with a new revelation they go with that and they fail to take whatever they believe back to the Bible amen whatever the prophet said take it back to the Bible amen if the Bible don't say it it meant the prophet says you don't have to believe me he said it's the Bible amen praise God take it back to the Bible amen people say well I he said I didn't say nothing guess that but I said take it back do

of you and the word of God Amen is going to be on one Accord are you with me so but a lot of times people you know looking for a loophole something that's going to satisfy them and and no no mind you you might be looking for just an area that's going to suit your little you know if only you had a mixed congregation and where we have the wives the Spanish the black the African I do not want to be in church like that is that going to save you is that going to help you uh oh what I I want that more than any of y'all in here are you with me I would like to see when we come to church that we got a multiple Nations and people from all over the world and and we all just but one body amen baptized into Jesus Christ and one Spirit but I think God what we have amen thank God for the word because that's not what I'm looking for that's going to help me and that's going to please me amen and that gonna make me happy amen I'm happy with Jesus I'm happy because I'm saved I'm happy because he died for me I'm happy because I know that I know that God Amen Hallelujah praise God I'm not going looking for that I have that I'm not looking for that are you looking for a little bit more knowledge a little bit more true I had that praise God can somebody teach a little better can somebody preach a little better can somebody give me a little bit more understanding than others praise God tell you what you do the daddy that you have to switch it for another daddy they're a little bit more intelligent the mama that you have switch it for another mama you know what I'm saying because another Mama may be a little bit more lenient than your mama yeah you understand see but when you get that other guy you're gonna find out that's not your dad and when you get the other Mama you're gonna find out that's not my mama you know what I'm saying ain't nothing like amen you know once God give you amen a certain uh Pastor God reveals to you what he wants you to have ain't nothing else gonna replace it

because amen you're not theirs amen so what God gives us we got to be thankful to God you gave it to me and I appreciate what you gave me Hallelujah you see what I'm saying I I it may not make too much sense but a lot of times we seek and we try to find something uh apparent that's gonna uh uh preach a Ministry a church that's gonna sue me I mean you deceived you you really you're really in a great deception because you're gonna take the word and you're gonna uh place the word make the word suit you you're gonna take Jesus and Let Jesus you're gonna tell Jesus how to treat you you're going to tell Jesus how amen what you ought to be saying is what I say see it's something about having you know parents and they they should be leading you but you want to leave your father than your mama are you with me and some people want to you know the church amen want to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ or the wife of Jesus Christ but the church want to be leading the husband which is Jesus Christ and he's the word and they want to be the one lead seven women take over to one man to let us eat our own bread but let us be called by your name are you with me and that's what's happening in the church people want a church that's going to make them feel comfortable all about my convenience my comfort and I don't need all of that to be saved no you don't know you certainly don't need all of that I don't need all of this and that to be saved I'm saved because Jesus died for my sins I'm saved because I've accepted him as a lord of my life [Music] I question that the Lord means he rules and he's in control I questioned that the Bible said he the spirit of Truth to lead you into all truth isn't that right so salvation we're talking about the grace of God um I said two I gotta close you know but and uh seven um two and eight if eating two and eight but by the grace of God uh I I believe it's it's total Grace but I'm saying don't make Grace a disgrace don't take and make Jesus Christ a disgrace don't take the word of God and and just do what you want because I'm saved and I'm saved by grace I and I thank God that I know I'm saved no no no no you make and do anything you big and bad enough to do and live any kind of way you want to live but you saved by grace no no no no don't take Grace and make it a disgrace amen people are Christians are doing the same thing the world is doing and they say well I'm saved and I know I'm saved and they bold and they're bad and they're tough and they're rough but one they gonna give account to God one day they'll face God and God said huh you bad you big you did what you want isn't that right and you told God Amen I got a preacher to tell me I'm saved and I'm all right are you up man you know we got some people that don't that have rejected the Holy Ghost that don't want the Holy Ghost God bless you he said I'm closing right here come on up kill them musician amen for by Grace ye are saved through faith and then not of yourself it is the what not it works at least any man should what both now because of that people are actually excited I'm saved by grace that means brother sister I don't need the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is going to lead you and guide you but I'm saved and because they saved they say I got the Holy Ghost are you up man I'm saved I predestinate I've been ordained of God I know I got the Holy Ghost I think you got it but I don't know what the Holy Ghost got you you got the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost Ain't Got You are you with me you telling God how to how to lead you how to guide you and how to use you instead of the Holy Ghost amen when you led by the spirit of God by the word of God you talking about some homophone you talking about folks that trying to please God the holy ghost that cause you to want to do what the word say and want to live like the word amen and it'd be easy why because it's not you that live in this Christ that lives inside you God bless you this morning are you all right amen it's not what we've done not what we can do it's by Grace your saved you know I said thank God for the church we came out and the apostolic people they they place a lot of emphasis on the baptism in Jesus Christ's name which is right but at the same time if you don't be careful you'll think that the water savior are you with me and and if you could do a work that can save you then you you believe the grace of God is in vain it's not what we've done is what Jesus has done for us are you with me somebody said if I tarry I Call On Jesus uh Jesus I call it a fast I get the Holy Ghost when I speak in tongue it's not your tongue that fill you with the Holy Ghost it's not how fast you call it now how about you praise and how about you jump and Shout that don't mean nothing Devils can do that but the Holy Ghost come from God when you total Surrender Your Life to him and when you yield completely to him it's the Lord not my will but let your will be done whatever you want Lord I do wherever you will no matter what difficult and how it oh Lord I want you your will to be done no no no more leading yourself but the Holy Ghost is leading you're not in control of your life no more but God is in control of your life this whether or not we're going to trust him enough to let him have preeminence to let him have his way praise God he don't think like you think amen I don't care what you think God don't think like you but he said let this mind be in you that was also aware in Christ Jesus be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the what renewing of your mind amen praise God I want the mind of Jesus Christ amen I want to live so God can use me amen I want to live amen what God is in control of my life I want him in control how about you do you want a God that's in control or do you want to control your own destiny but he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and has put predestinated us into the adoption of sons are you
