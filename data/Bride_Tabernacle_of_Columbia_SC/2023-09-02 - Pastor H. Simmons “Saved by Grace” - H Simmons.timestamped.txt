[36:43] Jesus Christ God we ask you to bless the

[36:50] Lord for Jesus Christ we look to you now

[37:14] friends

[37:18] glad for everybody amen
[37:22] um The Book of Romans 5 and 6 Romans 5
[37:27] and 6.
[37:35] you know the question is
[37:37] we all we all should all always said
[37:41] Jesus saves
[37:44] but the question is do you want to be
[37:46] saved
[37:47] Jesus saved
[37:51] and we always say
[37:53] here most people can quote John 3 16 God
[37:57] so loved the world that he gave his only
[37:59] begotten son whosoever believe in him
[38:01] should not perish but have everlasting
[38:04] life
[38:05] but the question is do you want
[38:07] everlasting life
[38:11] so here we are
[38:13] uh Romans 5 and 6.
[38:17] from when we were yet without strength
[38:20] in due time Christ died for the what
[38:24] ungodly for scarcely for
[38:28] a righteous man will one die yet
[38:30] prevention for a good man someone even
[38:33] dare dot to die
[38:35] but God committed his love to us towards
[38:41] us
[38:41] in that while we were yet sinners Christ
[38:45] died for who
[38:47] much more than
[38:49] being now justified by his blood we
[38:53] shall be saved from wrath through him
[38:56] for if when we were enemies excuse me
[39:02] we were enemies we were reconciled to
[39:06] God by the what
[39:08] death of his son much more being
[39:11] reconciled
[39:13] we shall be saved by what
[39:17] not ours but his
[39:20] amen
[39:22] you can't live good
[39:24] well enough or good enough to save your
[39:27] yourself
[39:28] it's his life God bless you you may be
[39:31] seated
[39:39] I don't I don't want to get too deep in
[39:41] here I just want to be simple tonight
[39:43] the Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2.
[39:49] saved by grace tonight
[39:52] Say by grace
[39:57] it's
[39:58] the Bible tells us it's not a works at
[40:01] least any manship boasts
[40:03] it is the gift of God
[40:06] you know I sometimes it's debatable
[40:10] some people believe that if I do this
[40:13] I'll be saved the Jehovah Witness teach
[40:15] if you knock doors and you know you give
[40:18] out the pamphlets and you have little
[40:20] studies and people home that you're
[40:22] saved the Mormons they go on their
[40:25] missionary journey and they got to go
[40:27] from house to house and do their thing
[40:30] everybody feel like they got to do
[40:32] something
[40:33] to be saved
[40:35] Jehovah Witness
[40:38] is only 144 000 the street slave class
[40:42] can go to heaven
[40:44] and the rest of the people you know
[40:46] if you work
[40:49] you can inherit the earth if you work
[40:52] hard enough
[40:53] and you be faithful
[40:56] so they teach that so everybody got
[40:59] their terminology
[41:01] true
[41:03] whereby if you abide by this or you
[41:06] abide by that you can be saved
[41:10] and that's every church every
[41:12] denomination
[41:14] they got away
[41:17] that they teach and they're Doctrine and
[41:22] they were preaching that you can be
[41:24] saved
[41:25] but we don't need to be confused as only
[41:28] one savior
[41:31] are you up man
[41:32] the Bible said we're saved not by what
[41:35] we do by his life
[41:38] not by what we know
[41:40] it's about his life
[41:43] see because a lot of times people
[41:44] because they know
[41:46] a lot
[41:48] and they know something you don't know
[41:51] didn't they tell you you're not saying
[41:53] or you cannot be saved
[41:55] a lot of people if you don't keep the
[41:58] Sabbath
[42:00] then you receive the mark of the beast
[42:03] so a lot of
[42:07] lots of time people tell you
[42:09] what you don't do
[42:12] and if you don't do this and if you
[42:15] don't believe that then you can't be
[42:17] saved the Bible says in Mark 16 16 he
[42:20] that believes in there to baptize shall
[42:22] be saved he didn't believe in not shall
[42:24] be damned
[42:26] okay Jesus said now I'm the way the
[42:29] truth and the light no man can come to
[42:31] the father but by me
[42:33] but
[42:34] we have many that think that they
[42:38] can put you in or put you out of heaven
[42:42] and if you do what they preach or
[42:45] they'll teach or their church or their
[42:46] denomination then you can be saved
[42:52] brothers and sisters we got to get away
[42:53] from thinking
[42:56] that Heaven only belonged to
[43:00] who we want in or who we want out
[43:06] if you do it this way
[43:08] and if you do it that way
[43:10] so a lot of times people's minds have
[43:12] been programmed
[43:14] so they're listening
[43:17] but they don't know that something has
[43:19] been injected in their spirit
[43:23] do you think they cause
[43:25] the Bible says that we can understand
[43:27] all Mysteries and have not charity
[43:28] Prophet that's what
[43:30] nothing
[43:32] so sometimes people think if I got this
[43:36] mystery of the seventh seed or the seven
[43:39] Thunder this I got oh I got it oh
[43:43] understand all Mysteries
[43:46] still you ain't saying
[43:50] are you a fan
[43:52] see a lot of times folk think because I
[43:55] got something nobody got
[43:57] and see sometimes preachers pull people
[44:00] into their Revelation their mystery and
[44:04] they hold the people in bondage because
[44:06] the people think that the preacher got
[44:09] something I gotta have
[44:11] I got friends of mine
[44:15] and they preach all over the world
[44:19] and they believe that you've got to
[44:21] believe that way
[44:23] I got the message
[44:26] I got it this way
[44:28] somebody else said I got another friend
[44:30] I got it this way
[44:32] I see it this way and you got to believe
[44:33] me
[44:35] this is it you got to believe me
[44:37] so we spread what we think that we got
[44:41] all over the world and I want to see how
[44:43] many people are going to believe like me
[44:46] so we create camps
[44:49] this one got a camp
[44:52] we might call it
[44:54] Perugia we might call it thunders we
[44:57] might call it whatever
[45:02] but yet
[45:04] we're saved by grace through faith
[45:08] are you with me
[45:11] so it's the grace of God that's going to
[45:14] save
[45:15] the preacher that knows it all
[45:18] the church they think they got it all
[45:21] it's the grace of God Gonna Save an
[45:25] individual it's not what we do and not
[45:28] what we have done uh have not done
[45:31] it's by Grace you'll see
[45:34] are you with me
[45:36] so
[45:38] people got a problem with that
[45:40] because everybody
[45:43] seem to be tooting their own horn
[45:46] and people are
[45:48] who
[45:49] I see it
[45:51] yes you might see exactly what they want
[45:54] you to see but you don't know that you
[45:57] don't see Jesus
[45:59] are you up there
[46:01] the one that you ought to be seeing he
[46:03] said if I be lifted up
[46:06] Adra
[46:09] it's Jesus Christ if he's being lifted
[46:13] up then he's going to draw all men
[46:15] notice
[46:18] it's not the church going to teach you
[46:21] all things
[46:23] it's not the preacher going to teach you
[46:24] all things
[46:25] but Jesus said the comforter which is
[46:29] the Holy Ghost whom the father was sent
[46:31] in my name he shall
[46:34] teach you what
[46:36] that's why John said you have not that
[46:39] any man should teach you what the
[46:41] anointing to unction you have an unction
[46:43] from the Holy One
[46:45] and uh
[46:47] and that Holy Ghost is going to be your
[46:50] teacher
[46:51] he's going to lead you and guide you
[46:53] into all truth
[46:55] if it's not the Holy Ghost some people
[46:59] think the Holy Ghost will lead you into
[47:03] hey y'all ain't got it
[47:06] see
[47:08] as I said to the church yesterday I kept
[47:11] getting out and every morning I opened
[47:14] my Bible it comes to the place where
[47:18] Jesus disciples were saying to Jesus
[47:21] Jesus we saw one casting out devils in
[47:24] your name and we forbid him we stopped
[47:28] him because he wasn't with us
[47:32] and Jesus said if somebody casting out
[47:36] devils in my name can highly speak evil
[47:39] of me and he that is not against us is
[47:43] what
[47:45] isn't that right
[47:48] now you understand he that is not
[47:52] against us as well
[47:54] for us
[47:56] but sometimes we find ourselves against
[47:59] everybody that not of our persuasion
[48:06] Prophet God taught that it wasn't the
[48:08] people
[48:10] that he was
[48:11] it's the Antichrist system the
[48:14] denominational system decrees the dog
[48:16] was and to the word taken away from the
[48:18] word are you with me but it's not the
[48:20] people
[48:23] that I'm against I'm against the spirit
[48:27] of the Antichrist that's against the
[48:30] word
[48:31] are you with me
[48:32] but sometimes
[48:34] folks take an attitude and they look
[48:38] like they against people
[48:40] because they make themselves thank God
[48:44] then I'm not like that sinner there
[48:48] I fast I pay my tithes but I thank God
[48:52] that I'm not like that sinner
[48:56] see
[48:59] we think ourselves to be a lot of
[49:02] Pharisee except your right to succeed
[49:04] that are described and Pharisee you and
[49:07] know why it's going to end
[49:09] are you with me
[49:12] say
[49:13] by grace
[49:15] are you with me
[49:18] it's not
[49:20] that you deserve it
[49:22] it's God's favor
[49:26] it's the goodness of God that leads a
[49:29] man to repentance
[49:31] it's because he loves you
[49:33] and because his Mercy
[49:36] endureth
[49:38] forever
[49:39] God loves you enough to lay down his
[49:44] life far
[49:46] not his friends his enemies
[49:49] are you with me
[49:51] you didn't love God I didn't love God
[49:53] but God laid down his life even when we
[49:57] were enemies we didn't want to serve him
[49:58] we didn't want to live right we didn't
[50:00] want to do right because our nature was
[50:04] wrong
[50:06] we're by okay let's just look at it
[50:09] Ephesians 2 1.
[50:14] and you as he quickened Made Alive who
[50:18] were dead
[50:20] and trespass and sin
[50:23] the day Adam and Eve the day they ate of
[50:27] the tree that's the day they died
[50:29] spiritually they died
[50:31] naturally no man was able to live
[50:35] a thousand years because a thousand
[50:37] years in the Lord as just one day
[50:41] are you with me
[50:43] but through the live 969 years but he
[50:46] what
[50:47] he died
[50:48] are you with me
[50:50] so no man but
[50:52] has lived the day in God's eyes are you
[50:56] with me and spiritually his in his inner
[51:00] man died and needed to be redeemed
[51:05] his conscience
[51:07] amen he became conscious
[51:10] of his sin because he recognized that he
[51:14] was naked
[51:17] so what
[51:19] now people now today they don't
[51:22] recognize the nakedness
[51:25] are you a man
[51:27] but they they recognized he said I heard
[51:31] your voice walking into God and I hear
[51:33] myself why because
[51:37] I was naked
[51:40] amen before sin came in there was no
[51:43] conscience you could walk it was no
[51:46] sustaining at the lust of the flesh the
[51:49] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[51:52] you didn't have no problem with your
[51:53] eyes because it meant everything was
[51:55] pure
[51:58] but people trying to be pure now
[52:02] I said I ain't got no problem with that
[52:04] I ain't got no problem with this ain't
[52:05] got no problem with that you know what
[52:08] people ain't got no problem with sin no
[52:10] more
[52:12] people don't have their conscious of
[52:14] being hard
[52:16] their Consciousness has been like a hot
[52:19] iron they said people are becoming
[52:21] reprobate
[52:23] they don't want God they turn them down
[52:24] they say I don't need him
[52:28] so in their hearts it's hard hard
[52:31] people are doing all kind of
[52:33] hideous stuff
[52:35] and they're not saying I'm afraid of God
[52:37] and I'm reverence God I have a fear of
[52:39] God I have a love for God and I don't
[52:41] love him they don't mind telling you
[52:43] that
[52:45] so they can do anything they can kill
[52:48] they can rape they can murder them
[52:50] they can do anything and
[52:53] and they can smile and laugh about it
[52:56] why
[52:58] they're hard to become hard
[53:01] the Bible said the love of men are going
[53:02] to watch gold
[53:05] so they cold-hearted
[53:07] are you with me
[53:09] so we're living in a world
[53:11] that is gone
[53:13] totally insane
[53:16] whoa
[53:18] oh God I don't mean to be long tonight
[53:20] but the grace of God we blame by Nature
[53:26] were the children around it says here
[53:29] I go back over the second verse
[53:31] when in time past we walk according to
[53:35] the course of this world according to
[53:37] the what
[53:40] the what
[53:43] don't y'all know the devil
[53:46] amen the Devil comes to church
[53:50] I wouldn't say he said on the front road
[53:53] yeah
[53:57] if I can't say sit on the back road you
[54:00] know
[54:01] the devil come to church he he on time
[54:04] too
[54:06] are you with me
[54:09] the devil ain't laid
[54:11] praise God why
[54:13] because the devil want to see how what
[54:16] kind of spirits he can inject in you
[54:19] to make you come against God
[54:23] somebody said I'm not going to say Amen
[54:27] that was you didn't get that I'm not
[54:30] going to say Amen to the word of God it
[54:32] came from a spirit that had anoints you
[54:35] that you cannot say Amen because I
[54:39] disagreed with the word
[54:42] but when you agree with the word you
[54:44] ought to be able to say Amen
[54:47] are you up man but when you got a pause
[54:52] it's because
[54:53] either we don't understand
[54:56] oh the devil got your tongue
[55:00] oh you have been
[55:02] and of the
[55:04] I read a book sometime Hung by the
[55:06] Tongue
[55:07] are you with me
[55:09] and sometimes the devil
[55:11] I have your tongue
[55:13] it won't let you praise God why because
[55:16] it makes you feel guilty
[55:19] are you a man if you praise God then
[55:22] you're a hypocrite
[55:24] because you're not living right
[55:26] but when you live right you can say
[55:28] praise the Lord
[55:30] you can say thank you Jesus
[55:32] you can say Lord I want all your God
[55:35] from me
[55:37] give me all you got
[55:40] I want your spirit I want you Lord
[55:44] it ought to be all right
[55:47] but when you got trouble with God
[55:50] you know what I'm saying you you got
[55:52] uncertainty with God
[55:54] you know you you can't praise him well I
[55:57] don't know but when you're certain that
[56:00] God is God
[56:01] and he's real to you
[56:04] and you know he's the word in the
[56:06] beginning was the word the word was with
[56:07] God and the Word was God isn't that
[56:09] right
[56:10] and you know the word of God this is God
[56:13] this is God in letter form but the Holy
[56:16] Ghost is God in spirit form
[56:19] are you with me same God Amen wrote the
[56:22] Bible it's the same God that can live in
[56:25] us with his
[56:27] spirit
[56:28] okay
[56:30] it says
[56:32] The Prince and the power of the air the
[56:34] spirit that now worketh in what
[56:40] you wonder why we look at it he said
[56:44] among whom also we what
[56:48] among whom also we what
[56:53] we we you missed something very
[56:55] important
[56:57] that person over there that person over
[56:59] there that one that one not
[57:03] he said we what
[57:05] preaching the pulpit
[57:07] included isn't that right we all nobody
[57:12] was
[57:14] excluded we all
[57:17] are you with me
[57:19] so when you look at it
[57:21] somebody said well I'm so special to God
[57:24] that I'm Justified as though I've never
[57:26] done it yeah you've done it
[57:29] you've done it
[57:32] oh I'm Justified that God said that God
[57:34] has never done it in the first place
[57:37] you've done it
[57:38] sometimes we got to get a little bit
[57:40] simple
[57:41] yeah you've done it and you got to be it
[57:44] got to become convicted and convinced
[57:47] that you need salvation I need Jesus
[57:51] I need to be forgiven I need to accept
[57:53] the blood of Jesus and what he's done
[57:56] for me
[57:57] don't let me jump across that
[58:00] jumped on up in The Mystery World let me
[58:03] come to the reality that I need Jesus
[58:07] amen I'm in bad shape I needed help I
[58:11] need the law and I need God
[58:14] amen
[58:16] but we jump to justification and I've
[58:19] never done anything man you need to
[58:20] change that Old Vile nature That Old
[58:23] Vile way of living and that old corrupt
[58:26] way of living you need God you need you

[58:31] have peace with your own self you need
[58:33] peace with God

[58:36] but here we look and jump all the way up
[58:39] and people flying come on let's come
[58:41] down to earth let's get God first
[58:43] and then let's go on
[58:46] to perfection

[58:49] way

[1:03:34] of Wrath even as others but God what
[1:03:40] see that's what it is
[1:03:42] rich in Mercy
[1:03:46] for his great love with he won
[1:03:49] he loved us amen
[1:03:51] even
[1:03:53] when we were dead in what
[1:03:56] has he made alive quickened us together
[1:04:00] with Christ by what
[1:04:04] by what
[1:04:06] do you deserve it

[1:04:17] aren't you glad
[1:04:21] aren't you glad that he did it for you
[1:04:25] do you appreciate him doing it
[1:04:30] I mean eternal life is yours
[1:04:33] but you got to believe that
[1:04:36] it's a better life
[1:04:38] the life that we live now
[1:04:41] if this was it whether it be worth
[1:04:44] living
[1:04:46] stuff we have to go through things we
[1:04:48] have to put up with
[1:04:50] sometimes we you know this all life has
[1:04:53] to offer
[1:04:56] but Jesus Christ got a better way
[1:05:00] are you with me
[1:05:01] except a man be born again he cannot
[1:05:04] work
[1:05:05] see the kingdom of God
[1:05:08] God wants to show you his glory his
[1:05:11] Beauty
[1:05:13] his favor
[1:05:14] he wants to show you his purpose
[1:05:18] why he died
[1:05:20] because he cared
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:25] sometimes we live in our own little
[1:05:27] world saying nobody care about me
[1:05:30] but Jesus Christ already proved how much
[1:05:32] you care
[1:05:35] sometimes we feel like nobody really
[1:05:37] really genuinely lovers
[1:05:39] but he already proved how much he loved
[1:05:41] us
[1:05:43] are you with me
[1:05:45] and you don't have to do any more he's
[1:05:48] already done enough
[1:05:51] if his grace and mercy went on our lives
[1:05:54] you know we couldn't even get out the
[1:05:55] bed this morning and somebody wasn't
[1:05:57] able to get up

[1:07:02] but you you wow
[1:07:05] are you up man

[1:07:11] enough about you if the devil had his
[1:07:14] way with you he'll destroy you right now
[1:07:18] not unless he got a job for you to do
[1:07:22] the only reason he don't kill you you
[1:07:23] got a job for you to do
[1:07:27] see you're gonna be
[1:07:30] a witness for somebody
[1:07:33] if you don't want to be a witness for
[1:07:34] God you're going to be a witness
[1:07:36] you're gonna work
[1:07:37] one way or another
[1:07:39] are you with me
[1:07:41] for God but for the devil
[1:07:44] ain't no in between things
[1:07:48] you're gonna accept what Jesus did for
[1:07:51] you and take on his divine nature and
[1:07:54] live the line of life he wants you to
[1:07:55] live or you're going to live that kind
[1:07:57] of life
[1:07:58] that the devil in the journey that the
[1:08:00] devil the Bible said the way of a
[1:08:02] transgress is hard
[1:08:05] are you with me but he said my yoke is
[1:08:07] easy and my burdens are what life
[1:08:11] and you can find what
[1:08:13] rest for your soul
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:16] I'd rather choose God's way
[1:08:19] amen
[1:08:21] it might be a uh he said broad is the
[1:08:23] way to lead to what
[1:08:25] destruction man ain't gonna go that way
[1:08:28] but straight and narrow is again
[1:08:31] lead it to righteousness
[1:08:33] not many gonna go that way
[1:08:36] but God knows that there's somebody want
[1:08:39] to go that way
[1:08:40] somebody want to live that kind of way
[1:08:42] somebody want to be a child of God
[1:08:44] somebody want to be a Christian
[1:08:46] it ain't meant it but it's a it's a few
[1:08:49] owner I'm glad that I'm one of them
[1:08:52] amen I'm glad that I'm that God put it
[1:08:54] in my heart to make the right decision
[1:08:57] but I want to be a Christian I want to
[1:08:59] live for him
[1:09:02] so it's been 50 some years and 50 years
[1:09:05] or more but I thank God

[1:09:40] are you with me
[1:09:41] by grace
[1:09:44] by what he's done for us
[1:09:48] the only reason we live this kind of
[1:09:52] life
[1:09:53] it's an appreciation
[1:09:56] and saying God I thank you
[1:09:59] it's my way of saying thank you Lord
[1:10:02] for what you've done for me
[1:10:04] amen I'm not living this life because
[1:10:06] I'm in bondage it's because of
