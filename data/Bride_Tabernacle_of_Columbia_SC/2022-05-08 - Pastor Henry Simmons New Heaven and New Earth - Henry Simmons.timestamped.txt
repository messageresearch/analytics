[42:24] we were touching a little bit in mullins
[42:26] on thursday night
[42:29] about the new jerusalem
[42:31] so we were talking about
[42:34] uh on the new jerusalem what god has in

[42:50] and a new earth
[42:52] in this troubled world we're not going
[42:54] to look for things to get better but
[42:56] things are going to get worse and worse
[43:01] so
[43:02] but we just got to keep pressing our way
[43:05] in a troubled world we got to keep on
[43:08] keep looking up
[43:10] because god got better things in store
[43:12] for you and i
[43:14] so he says
[43:17] and i'm backing up a little bit in this
[43:19] third chapter backing up a little bit
[43:22] and uh looking at
[43:24] the my heart is really heavy because
[43:29] i i came to mullins the other night and
[43:32] they was telling me
[43:34] uh
[43:34] brother marshall was telling me he says
[43:37] oh young man just got killed you know
[43:40] by the police and about every week he
[43:42] was telling me so and someone got killed
[43:44] someone got killed you know
[43:46] so
[43:47] we'll we well you know a tragic time
[43:52] a time where
[43:55] you got to be on the lurk
[43:58] you got to be watchful
[44:01] amen you got to be prayerful and even at
[44:04] that
[44:05] it's just the grace of god it's keeping
[44:07] us
[44:08] just the grace of god that's keeping
[44:10] each and every one of us
[44:12] and sometimes we see the angle
[44:16] you know
[44:17] i look at it
[44:19] and i see where the devil is taking the
[44:21] world
[44:23] you know i see the tattoos all over the
[44:26] people's arms all over the head and in
[44:29] the face and
[44:30] everywhere they can pierce themselves
[44:32] they're piercing themselves every little
[44:35] spot on them their arms and legs they
[44:38] just tattooing themselves up i don't
[44:40] know they're making themselves look
[44:43] i mean you look at it and i don't know
[44:46] what they're looking at when they look
[44:47] in the mirror
[44:49] people's hair going all kind of way
[44:52] you know nappy head or looking
[44:55] they're looking horrible but
[44:57] someone's saying this is cool
[45:00] people looking so bad
[45:03] but but when you see somebody pleasant
[45:05] with a nice haircut a nice uh groom a
[45:09] young lady looking
[45:11] nice and
[45:12] you know
[45:13] it's just looking
[45:16] pleasant
[45:17] you know and something about people that
[45:20] are pleasant people today
[45:22] just looking like a young lady
[45:25] you know
[45:26] that's you know
[45:28] i'm saying you don't see that often
[45:31] that a young lady would want to look
[45:34] like a young lady
[45:35] and a a young fellow a young man would
[45:38] want to look you know
[45:40] kind of neat dress and clean and
[45:43] you know
[45:45] just like a gentleman
[45:47] you don't have to see that anymore
[45:50] but i want to say to your mothers that
[45:53] have children that's respectable
[45:56] and that you're trying your best to
[45:59] you know point them in the right
[46:01] direction i want to commend you
[46:03] for your effort and what you do
[46:06] it does make a difference in the school
[46:08] and the job everywhere
[46:10] when you got mothers and sometimes even
[46:12] at your best i know some of the mothers
[46:15] have done a tremendous good job
[46:17] but when children get a certain age they
[46:20] just rebel against
[46:22] because there's a pool out there
[46:24] there's a pull out there in the world
[46:26] and it's it's strong it's real strong
[46:29] but i want to say to you mothers be
[46:31] encouraged
[46:32] you did your best and get a good job
[46:35] but be encouraged to god
[46:38] that you keep looking to god because god
[46:41] can turn things around for you
[46:43] are you with me
[46:45] now there are others that are not
[46:47] instructed
[46:48] like
[46:49] they don't hear the word they don't
[46:51] see the need
[46:54] but as we prepared for heaven
[46:58] the world is preparing for the
[47:00] the lake of fire
[47:03] so
[47:04] they are preparing for where they are
[47:06] going
[47:07] and the devil is
[47:10] he's put he's putting his
[47:14] he's putting his mark upon them
[47:18] he's putting his mark he's putting his
[47:20] imprint in their life
[47:22] that's why they're tattooing himself
[47:24] they
[47:25] putting all kind of piercing he's
[47:27] putting his mark he's he's in putting
[47:29] his influence on upon their lives
[47:32] he's making them look like what it's
[47:35] going to look like
[47:36] if you crossed over into the region of
[47:39] the laws
[47:40] he's actually in printing
[47:42] he's mocking them
[47:46] and putting his small
[47:48] he's saying you belong to me
[47:51] and when you look in the mirror you see
[47:53] that image
[47:55] you see that monk the mark of the beast
[47:57] the mark of the antichrist the mark of
[47:59] the false prophet you see that image you
[48:02] looking at
[48:03] so they are saying don't i look good
[48:06] until a christian our eyes are saying
[48:09] why would anybody want to
[48:11] do that to themselves
[48:13] why do they want to look like that
[48:16] and it's
[48:17] you know looks
[48:19] hideous sometimes people
[48:21] but that's just so how far
[48:24] is too far
[48:26] and how far will we go
[48:30] my cousin in philly he was saying he
[48:34] said
[48:34] he was showing us around philadelphia
[48:37] a couple of months ago or some months
[48:39] ago and he said it's a place in philly
[48:42] you don't want to go
[48:43] because those people in that area they
[48:46] all look like zombies
[48:49] they look like you know the walking dead
[48:53] they say you don't want to go to that
[48:55] place
[48:57] and one of the brothers that was giving
[48:59] this testimony he says it's free they
[49:02] give them free drugs and all they just
[49:05] stay high
[49:07] and that's it's like that
[49:09] how would you want a life do you want a
[49:10] life like that
[49:13] you know
[49:14] you want a life where the devil is
[49:16] dragging you
[49:18] he's pulling you she's in such a course
[49:22] of
[49:23] dreadfulness
[49:25] and the bible said before the great and
[49:27] dreadful day he would send you elijah
[49:29] the prophet
[49:30] but there's a dreadful day up ahead
[49:34] let me just try to back up to the third
[49:37] version of just a second peter and i'm
[49:39] going to encourage you this morning i i
[49:42] wanted to preach and i was stirred but
[49:44] let me talk to you for a moment amen
[49:47] because we are living in trouble times
[49:50] difficult times and
[49:51] people are being pulled
[49:55] that's why the women cutting their hair
[49:57] off and the men let their head go along
[50:00] because there's a pull
[50:02] there's a pull against the word the
[50:04] bible says it's a shame for a man to
[50:05] have long hair
[50:07] and the woman wants she said okay if
[50:10] and if a woman have a
[50:13] hair's given to her for covering and if
[50:15] she has long hair it's a glory to her
[50:18] are you with me
[50:20] so what what it is we
[50:22] we're fighting against the word
[50:25] we're rebelling against the word that's
[50:28] why the women they cut their hair that's
[50:30] why the men
[50:32] they let their hair grow along
[50:34] what it is
[50:35] it's it's a battle going on
[50:38] it's a wall who's going to win you
[50:41] who's going to win you
[50:43] god is not going to
[50:45] put pressure on you
[50:48] he's just going to love you
[50:50] he's just going to just say i love you
[50:53] because i love you
[50:55] come to me
[50:57] and the devil i'm going to put pressure
[50:59] no
[51:00] no
[51:01] come my way
[51:03] so there's a wall going on battling
[51:06] battling for your soul battling for your
[51:08] mind
[51:09] that's a wall the greatest about ever
[51:11] fought is fought for your mind
[51:15] the devil is trying to take your mind
[51:18] amen
[51:20] not knowing the other
[51:23] night i was preaching on a little bit in
[51:25] mullins about a sound mind
[51:28] having a sound mind god has not given us
[51:31] the spirit of fear but of love and a
[51:32] power and of a sound mind
[51:35] so god gives us
[51:38] not the spirit of fear amen
[51:41] but god
[51:43] you love him
[51:44] and you want to serve him you want to
[51:46] worship him you want to give him your
[51:48] life because he cares for you he loves
[51:51] you
[51:52] amen god wants you ain't meant to
[51:55] experience his goodness his grace is
[51:58] love
[51:59] it's peace it's joy
[52:02] it's waiting on you but we don't want to
[52:05] just receive it because the devil he has
[52:08] some strongholds he has power strength
[52:12] i said god
[52:15] i was talking to michael and rachel and
[52:17] different and jarry knows i said i said
[52:20] devil got a stronghold
[52:22] amen i said we got to do more
[52:25] we got to be more
[52:27] persistent we got to
[52:30] persevere before god
[52:32] and stand in the gap for these young
[52:34] people because the devil is he's got a
[52:37] stronghold
[52:38] he's trying to take him straight into
[52:40] the picture hell
[52:43] but if we don't stand in the gap and
[52:44] really pray and really cry out to god
[52:48] but i thank god for
[52:50] a mother that prayed for me
[52:53] amen
[52:54] they prayed that god would open my eyes
[52:57] because i was blind one day too
[53:00] but my mother stood in the gap
[53:03] and she talked to me and told me
[53:06] god i want god to open your eyes son
[53:09] because you can see all the fault going
[53:11] on in the church but you need god for
[53:13] yourself
[53:15] you know
[53:16] you know that's a good mother a mother
[53:18] that will tell you amen you need an
[53:20] experience with god you need god
[53:23] and when god opened my eyes it didn't
[53:25] matter what other folks did in the
[53:27] church i wasn't talking about what they
[53:29] did and what somebody else because
[53:31] you know
[53:32] i understood what mama was saying
[53:35] you need you need god yourself look at
[53:37] you
[53:38] you need god
[53:41] and uh and that's that's the thing
[53:43] amen
[53:44] as individuals is it's you and god you
[53:47] need god
[53:49] i think i thank god that my eyes was
[53:52] open before i got too far down that road
[53:55] are you with me because you can get down
[53:57] that road and you can go through some
[53:59] stuff
[54:01] you can go through some um
[54:03] oh
[54:04] some
[54:05] harbor things down that road
[54:07] things that you wish you would never
[54:09] experience
[54:10] places you wish you would never win
[54:13] but you thought i could go and i can
[54:15] come out all right
[54:17] they meant most people go they don't
[54:18] come out all right and some folks that
[54:20] can't return
[54:22] but they think you know you know how we
[54:24] think when you're young you can do it
[54:26] and you're going to come back to serve
[54:27] the lord later you know
[54:30] we think that we think that we you know
[54:32] you know you know other folks did it i'm
[54:34] going to try to and i'm going but it
[54:36] don't work
[54:38] brothers and sisters don't work for
[54:39] everybody
[54:41] some people have a little grace and
[54:43] mercy and god allows it other people
[54:45] have to go through some strongholds
[54:50] and
[54:51] before they
[54:52] early this morning
[54:54] i was
[54:55] you know
[54:57] i think it was time to get up almost
[54:59] five something or something like that
[55:02] and i got up i mean i woke up
[55:05] and i said let me just try to rest a
[55:07] little longer today
[55:09] and then i said okay
[55:13] i couldn't
[55:14] just laid there for a minute and all of
[55:15] a sudden
[55:16] i started dreaming
[55:19] and in the dream
[55:21] it was a man
[55:24] uh uh looked like
[55:26] i thought that he had you know he was
[55:28] kind of lost his mind somehow this
[55:31] ambulance or some type of vehicle
[55:34] had stopped and they had this individual
[55:36] man that they were trying to contain
[55:39] some kind of way but he was just
[55:40] standing there and they were standing on
[55:42] the side they said we put all kind of
[55:44] tranquilizers in him and we put all kind
[55:47] of we tried to drug him with everything
[55:48] we could
[55:50] and um
[55:51] it didn't do no good it had no effect on
[55:53] it
[55:55] and the man reminded me of brother ojob
[55:58] from trinidad that past
[56:00] and
[56:02] he looked at me
[56:04] and it was a group of us standing around
[56:07] he looked at me he said you
[56:10] i said
[56:12] me he said yeah he said come here
[56:15] i wasn't afraid
[56:17] because you know
[56:18] god blessed us we pray for people
[56:21] that stephen possessed and god delivered
[56:24] him
[56:25] and you know i'm thinking you know well
[56:28] and then he said
[56:30] when i came forth he looked me in the
[56:32] eyes and i looked at him
[56:33] and he said
[56:38] the things that you've been going
[56:39] through and he started telling me about
[56:41] what i've been going through
[56:45] and some said this man ain't crazy
[56:48] he's a prophet
[56:51] i said oh
[56:53] he's a prophet
[56:55] and he began to
[56:57] share with me
[56:58] he said don't worry about it
[57:00] don't worry about it
[57:02] it's good for you
[57:05] the things that you go through is good
[57:06] for you
[57:08] i said oh okay
[57:10] and i was encouraged you know so i told
[57:12] my wife those this morning i said
[57:15] it's almost like a vision
[57:17] he said it's good for you
[57:20] and he told me one other thing
[57:22] he said you praying for people that
[57:25] don't want it
[57:28] you're praying for people that don't
[57:31] want to be saved
[57:34] i said oh
[57:37] i said i told my wife you're praying for
[57:39] people that don't want to be saved
[57:42] i said oh okay
[57:45] i just and i said
[57:48] i said i can't remember exactly
[57:50] what because it all happened so fast but
[57:54] it was so real
[57:56] because the first thing
[57:58] this person is supposed to be lost in
[58:00] mind they start telling me what i was
[58:02] going to
[58:03] hit it right now
[58:05] this person ain't crazy
[58:08] and i realized that was a prophet
[58:13] i don't know what it mean
[58:15] i didn't know i didn't think i was gonna
[58:17] share it this morning but i shared it
[58:19] anyway
[58:20] by the grace of god
[58:22] i don't know sometimes it's
[58:24] a blessing to you you know
[58:27] to hear
[58:29] what we go through
[58:30] god allows it
[58:32] and it's good for you even though you
[58:34] don't think it's good for you
[58:36] it's good the things you go through it's
[58:38] good for you
[58:42] but we think oh no where am i going
[58:44] through this
[58:45] god got a way of working it out to your
[58:48] good and i was sharing with marlins
[58:53] i just wrote some things down it says
[58:56] we worship the gift
[58:58] not the giver
[59:03] and the all good and perfect gifts come
[59:05] from above
[59:09] do you want god
[59:11] or
[59:13] his blessings
[59:17] do you want god or his blessings
[59:23] love what he gives us
[59:27] but don't love him
[59:33] we love what he gives us but don't love
[59:35] him
[59:39] and i was thinking about mother's day
[59:41] she's for better for worse
[59:43] in a marriage
[59:45] because the church is the bride of jesus
[59:47] christ
[59:49] for better or for worse
[59:53] love the better
[59:55] the good times the sunshine
[59:57] but we don't want the rain
[1:00:01] not knowing that the rain is good for us
[1:00:04] are you with me
[1:00:07] you know all the good days
[1:00:10] all the good times
[1:00:12] but sometimes it takes
[1:00:14] the bad times to make us enjoy it good
[1:00:16] times
[1:00:19] sometimes it takes the sickness to make
[1:00:21] us in thankful women well
[1:00:26] are you with me
[1:00:28] sometimes it takes your hurt and pain
[1:00:31] they meant to enjoy when the hurt and
[1:00:33] pain is going away
[1:00:36] it takes oh god
[1:00:40] and god is good amen
[1:00:44] hopefully i can get back to peter here
[1:00:46] but uh i i'm talking to you i can i'm

[1:03:51] happening now
[1:03:52] that america

[1:03:57] they helped sink one of russia's most
[1:04:00] powerful ships
[1:04:03] you know and they helped do this and

[1:04:16] because y'all making things worse the
[1:04:18] tension between russia and the united
[1:04:20] states
[1:04:21] is getting to the point that you you
[1:04:24] y'all supposed to keep that undercover
[1:04:26] whatever you're doing
[1:04:27] but y'all bringing it out and bragging
[1:04:29] on it he said don't don't do that
[1:04:32] i'm telling you really in a time where

[1:04:57] amen
[1:04:59] we can bolster our might and both of our
[1:05:02] but
[1:05:03] god god got scriptures stripped your
[1:05:05] promises
[1:05:07] concerning gog and magog and what they
[1:05:09] would do
[1:05:10] are you with me
[1:05:12] so russia is in the scripture
[1:05:16] their position in the bible

[1:05:52] hour where the world is not effective
[1:05:55] anymore in people's lives they're here
[1:05:57] but they it bounces off amen like water
[1:06:00] off a duck's back
[1:06:02] are you with me
[1:06:04] but
[1:06:05] instead of receiving amen they they
[1:06:08] they're just listening amen have people
[1:06:10] hearts become so hard
[1:06:13] amen have their ears to come so dull
[1:06:16] they meant that they can't even hear the
[1:06:18] word no more it won't penetrate it won't
[1:06:21] go deep enough it won't stir them
[1:06:23] anymore
