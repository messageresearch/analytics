us just by our heads and the word of prayer gracious kind heavenly father it's so good to be in your house again oh god we know that we have faith in you lord god that all things are possible to them that believe father we lord god we are just still lifting up our sister jackson sister jay and family and the english family today lord we're still lifting them up before you lord you would confidently continue to strengthen them and to be with them in jesus name lord god we just pray for brother branham oh john lord you just touch heal and lord god we're praying for all those that are on the prayer list lord we just pray that you'll move in your own special way god bless your word today give us strength give us guidance give us direction for lord you're in control we're dependent on you in jesus name amen the book of philippians the third chapter we thank god again philippians 3 and 7 through 14. i think it is philippians 3 7 through 14. okay i'll start i read the first you read the next we read the last verse together what things were gained to me those that count laws for christ okay philippines three excuse me seven through fourteen philippians 3 7-14 but but what things were gained to me those that count loss for christ and we found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith 10. if by any means i might attain into the resurrection of the dead twelve brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before fourteen i press towards the mark of the prize of the hard calling of god in christ jesus god bless during his word you may be seated amen because i thought on the other day was just in prayer and i thought how blessed we are and uh we're we certainly bless people and um and then i thought on many things about how christ is this is god throughout all ages and i thought about the absolute that he's our absolute there's none like him there's no other god besides him amen and we cannot put anything on the level of him for there's no equal [Music] there's no man there's no prophet there's no preacher there's no you know when it came down to moses and elijah amen and it was in the mountain of transfiguration and uh peter said lord it's good for us to be here let us build three tabernacles one for them one for moses and one for elijah amen and then they looked again and they saw save jesus only and it was saying i want you to hear him jesus amen so there's no room to con to equal jesus christ because he is god are you with me there's not amen anything that's going to be supreme are going to be over above jesus christ but he's god and his word in him a one is not three that we are trying to compare or equalize we're not trying to equalize anything we're not trying to bring anything up to that place or that standard amen god in his word is one jesus is god are you a man so when we look at it and people try to put anything on that same level amen it cannot be compared amen are you with me so sometimes we'll take words of men and we'll take words of churches and words of different ones and we'll try to level it off and meet it because it could be that they're saying the truth but speaking the same thing but we don't want to get confused there's nothing like him praise god thank god for god's servant in this hour thank god for each and every one of you amen but there's nothing like him amen save jesus only he's our only savior eve the one that died for us and without his death praise god i don't know what people are arguing about amen i want you to let that be established in your hearts amen because people are pointing you to all kind of signs and all kind of things but you got to be pointed back to the word because the word is god amen it's christ throughout all ages it wasn't moses it was christ in moses are you a man so amen it's the christ that's in you that makes the difference it's not you that's holy it's god that's holy in you amen when god get in you that's what makes the mountain holy and that's what makes you holy people because the holy god comes down and tabernacles within you are you up man so by the grace of god this morning uh i don't know i just gave you a little prelude or something else things that was on my heart but let me just talk about losing to win i think i ministered this some time back but it just came fresh on me as i was preparing to minister a funeral this afternoon and i said lord i just can't get away from it maybe i'll share some of these things this morning with you all losing to win um in the seventh verse of philippians but what things were gained to me those i count laws for christ are you with me see uh paul had gained a lot amen when you have a lot you have a lot to lose paul had you know he's probably studied under the academic world or or something like harvard yale or oxford uh some big uh school of theology and was under the best teachers in the world and he had attained amen authority to persecute the church to go down and find any that was going against well uh the religion of that day the jewish religion the god that he knew that it was only one god and it was uh uh a jehovah god and he wasn't gonna allow anybody amen to bring heresies in that which he thought so he thought that jesus was a false teacher a prophet and that he wasn't going to let anything anybody go against his teaching as a pharisee and sometimes people are fight for what they believe it used to be if a person was a a certain denomination they would stand on what they believe now people say everything goes don't worry about another just as long as you believe in god don't make no difference if you're buddha hindu is a confucianism muslim whatever just as long as you believe in god it's the same god so everybody's under we don't have confrontations anymore because it's all about love everybody just love it don't matter and so but when it was a disturbance it disturbed everything when jesus came that way amen and and and he was doing things and signs and wonders and miracles and even raised the dead and even ladders stinking for four days and he called him back from the dead and they never seen such things and it was it was actually doing something to uh their authority and the positions and their churches it was causing amen people to leave and go after this man called jesus so things were happening brother and sister i'm just saying that that you and i as christians amen you know uh you should not try to get fathers to come after you or come to your church it should be about the god that's in you that you're trying to introduce jesus to the people that jesus christ is god and that god shouldn't be a god that's for all that should be a life that inside of you praise god they'll come to know jesus they meant the life that's living amen the life that i now live i'm trying to introduce you to a god that's alive and a god that's a real and a god that changed my life a god that's in my life praise god a real and true living god that made a difference so here uh paul says when he ran into contact with the real god he realized that all i gained to lose is to win i'm willing to lose everything that i might win amen i'm saying this morning your loss is your game your dying is to live when you die you can live because real life don't exist outside of him [Music] praise god without him amen i'm like a ship without a sail without him i can do nothing if he didn't have marching on me this morning all right god i couldn't get up because it's only by the mercy and grace of god that i'm standing here this morning amen not how good i was and how strong am i but it's by the grace of god i am what i am thank god it's grace thank god he cared enough about me somebody said awake me with a finger of love praise god i thank god for him here in um philippians 1 and 21 it says uh for me to live is christ and to die is gain are you with me to live is christ in the dies game you know oftentimes amen we look at losing to die we're lost but to die is to gain we haven't lost anything to die is the game not to lose praise god i'm telling you brother and sister amen it comes down to our lives and amen and when we stand in jeopardy amen of losing everything amen we want to hold on to everything that we have because well uh we feel like we got to uh you know i i gotta have this and i gotta have that and we don't want to lose it but sometimes we have to be willing to give it up though matthew's uh 19 and 21 matthew 19 and 21 thank god for jesus christ amen some things that really come across my heart and 19 and 21 and we think about the young rich ruler the young man was young and rich and it was a ruler and i know we heard it many times and sometimes just said too many times it becomes repetitious but amen i don't want to say it i want to say it where it can resonate where it means something to somebody somebody amen amen maybe it's the time in the season for you to hear and understand what god is saying because sometimes it it you it's sad for somebody else but sometimes it's your time to hear just say it to you they meant the young man was young and he was rich and he was a ruler but look at um here at um 19 and 21 it says in the 21st the young man said in him all these things he talked about keeping the command but all these things that were kept from my youth jesus said unto him if thou would be what if that would be perfect gold and what see sometimes when it comes to selling out amen we got too much to lose we got i i i you know i got a lot here so that i got to consider sometimes in our youth amen it blinds us sometimes our youth sometimes amen it makes us confident that we got time on our side we can wait till tomorrow amen because we amen i got things amen that we want to do places we want to go amen experiencing in life but this young man amen recognized in all amen his richness and all amen his rulers and everything he had he realized that he was missing something they meant the young man probably had a you know a better life than most of us he probably had the best car he probably had money amen and he had he had his own business and everything he he was all right amen he had it all going for him and he was a church-going boy because he said when it comes down to commandments i kept all this from my youth up i'm a good fellow amen i'm not like those out there in the street and they meant thugging and trying to do this and that and and i'm not like that amen are you with me but he had too much to lose sometimes what we holding on to amen we don't want to give it up amen because amen it means more to us you see he asked jesus what must i do that i might inherit eternal life i want to know what i because it's something i i don't have that i i kept the commandment i go to church and i i i'm a ruler i'm successful but i don't have what i know you god and i want it amen it ought to be something amen that you possess that others won't amen i got something that amen that you know amen it's real i got something that's genuine i got something amen amen praise god you got to possess something pray man you got to you got to be the salt of the earth amen that amen men amen want some of that you got to be the lights of the world that men can see jesus well i wanted to talk this morning one time if i be lifted up there must be a standard jesus said if i be lifted up hey i'll draw man i'm telling you if you're going to lift anybody up you got to lift jesus up amen if you're going to exalt anybody it ought to be jesus amen praise god you ought to lift jesus up so by the grace of god here in the 25th verse jesus go and sell that thou has how many willing to do that this morning amen praise god and i want to you see it was a challenge to me this morning amen because what folks holding on to is not helping them amen it's not getting you where you need to be amen it's not causing you amen to have the peace and joy that only god can give you amen amen they can't amen hallelujah we need a life-changing experience we need certain amen that we can hack our soul though we need something amen oh god nothing in this world matters because i see beyond praise god this life amen i see a kingdom amen because i'ma tell you you know i i wrote down some things that would cause people to not want to sell out praise god and those things i wrote down what are you holding on to give it up and let it go praise god and sometimes you're holding on to your hurt you're holding on to your pains you're holding on to your failures your disappointments holding on to amen you know wife husbands i'm not talking about holding on to him in a good manner sometimes the wife has walked out sometimes the husband has walked out sometimes amen parents are not there for you are you up man sometimes amen that is not there sometimes mama is not there sometimes the thing that you need is not that for you so you you hold on to something that you ought to forgive for it's unforgiveness sometimes somebody injured you sometimes somebody that amen has caused damage in your life and sometimes you can't amen you can't seem to let go of of what they've done and and sometimes you we ourselves have done things they meant that the devil still accuses of and the devil still bring those things back to keep us from going forward sometimes we count our lives unworthy we count ourselves unworthy of the kingdom sometimes we look at ourselves and the devil will bring the guilt and amen bring the amen to sorrow back to you amen that he won't let you go free because you seem like well god forgive me can i pray can i pray in the state that i'm in can i get a prayer through in the condition that i'm in god what is going on with me amen god i need your help amen but i don't feel like god can hear me because i don't feel worthy he meant so how can god hear somebody like me will god speak to me amen god sighs something to me i want to know that praise god you're there for me that you can hear me sometimes we go through those states amen that we have to forgive others then we have to forgive ourselves we have to amend to let go of the hurt let go of the pain let go of the disappointment let go of the failure let go and let god sometimes we hold to that and we live a life of that condition amen because of what we have experienced in our lives and we want everybody to uh circle around us and encourage us and keep us encouraged it meant that we can go forward amen but amen because we don't get to rally and the support that we think that we need and we have to have in order amen to go forth in life sometimes we give up we give up on life because life is not serving amen and meeting in my my needs and sometimes we look for a church we look for a preacher we look for somebody that can understand praise god and sometimes the spirit that's in us that won't that we won't let go sometimes focus or protect us because they don't understand praise god sometimes people are riding around and support some spirit that you need to let go praise god they'll compromise with you and tell you it's going to be all right it's not going to be all right until you forgive yourself and others even if they had done you wrong are you with me you got to forgive them and just let it go are you with me for you to be free are you with me some for let go of your pride because that's a big hindrance to us our pride that we don't want to sell out to our pride praise god we ge sometimes it comes difficult for men to let go of their pride because they want to maintain that i'm a man amen and sometimes uh women amen they they they they feel like that i i'm weak and i i i'm dependent i need somebody and then sometimes the brothers feel like i don't need nobody because i can do it on my own are you with me so it's easy for sisters to get saved and it is for brothers to get saved because they understand that amen i need somebody i need god but brothers want to be independent and macho and big in somebody amen they don't want to humble themselves oh god help us let me just try to read this and and just to put some scripture with what we're saying okay he says and go sell that what i have and give to the poor praise god tell me how hard did i work i was going back to my life as a young man i was working at the hospital orthopedic tech ministering in all 23 years old the bishop's son came to says quit your job and come let's i got some streets i want you to preach on i got a city i want you to go to everybody told me boy and one sister i thank god for her she worked as an rnn and she came to me and i don't know how she knew she said boy don't you quit your job and follow someone's i said but me you know we want to do something for the lord you know and all things work together to the good i want you to know all things work together so good the sister that was already in we went to the same church and she was an elder sister my mama said boy don't you do this my brothers everybody tried to help me but you know sometimes we were we figured you know this is for the law i'm going for the law i'm telling you sometimes you have to be patient and really wait on the law when folk giving you good advice and sound advice you got to listen sometime but me you know i put it all under the hand of god i'm doing the will of god yeah yeah [Music] um brothers i'mma tell you i don't regret but i didn't have to go through some things i went through because i didn't listen to mama didn't listen to my brother robert i didn't listen to this when i i went through some stuff that they didn't have to go through are you with me because but through it all right i can i can help somebody else from the things that i've been through are you a man so so brother and sister i i i'm saying but one thing i can value i can value amen that i walked off from the job not knowing where i was going giving it up i think i was the first black orthopedic technician at that hospital and so i walked off and when i walked off i didn't know i'm on the corner preaching knocking doors all of a sudden we rented a little building and i started baptizing elderly people for people that was in wheelchairs and the poor in the needy looked like i had a senior citizen church in wheelchairs pushing them you know i had a senior citizen church and uh the people that were down and out in the city that i went to as soon as i helped the people their children come back to see about them then you got to go to our church because mama was buried in this graveyard and if you don't come to the church with us they wasn't going to church nowhere but you're going to our church because you got to be buried in the graveyard you see what i'm saying so it's all kind of things but the thing is that the point is that somewhere in your life you got to come to a place that you're willing to sell out and leave it all i'm talking about not when i just came out of the world and i had to leave amen all of my my dress and my style and everything that i had what my football and everything just walked off walked off the field that's it because god was calling me are you with me there's many times in our life that god gives us calls and god asks us to sell out at different periods of our life that god come back and he asks you the same thing i want you to sell different stages of our lives god comes back to the same thing are you willing to sell it all are you willing to give up all different points in our lives just when we thought we gave it up all and and we've come to follow him then god comes back to us again amen because we've oh we forgot i gotta go i don't want to be alone i got to preach in a little while again but let me talk to you about some things i wrote down you know folks will try to stop you and then try to block you when god starts speaking to your heart folks you you'll be surprised who those folks would be to try to block you and stop you see i dealt with the product of son in luke 15 he says i'm coming back home i'm going home and on this trip back home when he got back home i'm just closing early because i i got scriptures that i need to go through but i'm not gonna go through it he said i'm going back home see the the prodigal son he got all that was belonging to him of his father and he went out went out in the street and went out in the world and he he he he lived it up spent all that his father gave him find himself in bad shape in a place that he thought he'd never be being the jew he wouldn't have nothing to do with a swine a pig a hog unclean animal not only did he find himself in the hall of pen with the slap he wanted to eat it because he was hungry brother and sister sometimes the slop that the devil tried to feed us praise god i said it slopped cigarette smoking refilled puffing alcoholism slop the devil would ask you to eat slap that amen slop i can tell some things but i'm not going to hit too many things but it's a lot of slop that the devil would have you eat praise god but look where you were look what you left for slop as long as you was on top of your game everything was all right but you won't always be on the top sometimes you're going to get down to the bottom that's the place god can meet you praise god god don't meet us on the top god meets us when we're humble when we're broken god got to amen break us down to help us you know some folks will block you won't we'll let you get help they ain't gonna let you get help because amen they telling you you all right when you know you're not some folks are telling you you have to go through your shame and you have to go through your pain when god trying to get you out of that hog pin payment but it's up to you to come to yourself how do you come to yourself god comes to you you can't get to him but he comes to you i believe that god came into that mind of that young man and he realized this is what i left to come here to this this is where i left my father's house to get in the condition that i'm in i left i didn't know how blessed i was praise god i didn't know how good i had it praise god but i left it all to get in a hog man praise god i'm going to tell you something children god you're in the best place when you're in christ jesus that's the best place you can ever be praise god if you're not in him oh lord but here i'm gonna tell you something a young man came to himself i'm gonna tell you so sometimes that serving the lord don't know how to receive folks that are in bad shape when they come sometimes church folks got so good saving so holy that they don't know how to celebrate when somebody coming home are you with me but when the young man came home praise god and he said father forgive me for i have sinned against you and against heaven i want you to know praise god the father had already forgiven him when he saw him before praise god you may not have reached yet but god sees you'll fall off that you're on your way home hallelujah praise god seize your fall off that you're on your way home praise god when you start coming back came in to yourself he sees you on the way home not that you've gotten home and but the father is already making ready praise god for pam hey y'all get ready my my son son was dead see amen without god you died he said my son was dead praise god y'all y'all get everything ready we're going to have a party amen we're going to have a celebration because my son was dead praise god y'all go get the fattest calf and let's go let's get ready for this when the son got home his son was in a repentant state his son was god to come home and knew that all he wanted amen was just abused like a servant i don't want all of this but i just want to be just want to be in the kingdom god i just want to come back to my father's house i i oh that's what david said i'd rather be a dope keeper in the house of god amen if i can only just be a dope keep like i don't want nothing great i don't want no great possession i don't want nothing but lord just let me be a humble servant are you with me but those that sat around amen all righteous and all pious you know what they would have wanted them to criticize they was criticizing the father that brother that he had that stayed in the church that did not leave the church did not amen did not do rome stuff like they met young man went out and did all kind of stuff and amen live the wrong your life and amen but yet he came back home those folk in the church they ain't gonna let you back in too easy you ain't getting back in here not easy they gonna be hard on you they're gonna try to make your journey back hard why all the time i'm in the church and the pastor never celebrated me he never gave me a victory party he never gave me a thank you but uh uh i've been here all the time and i've been faithful and i deserve what he's given him because he went away why does he deserve it see what i'm saying sometimes we tell the father how amen and what to do i'm telling you i hope you understand that that son that went away he had been through some things they meant he had learned some things he learned that amen he'd already been to enough stuff amen he's already experienced enough hurt and enough pain and enough praise god don't let me come back home and somebody hating on me somebody even showing that i don't deserve this i know i don't and i didn't want it but my father gave it to me now are you what man is that what god does for you don't let nobody stand in your way when god begin to move in your life don't let nobody stop you praise god sometimes folks i ain't letting you come back that easy you just ain't gonna come back in here and
