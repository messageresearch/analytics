[46:34] unto the Lord thy God
[46:37] with what
[46:39] and with what
[46:43] the 19
[46:45] I call Heaven and Earth to record this
[46:47] day
[46:48] against you
[46:50] that I have set
[46:53] before you what
[46:56] blessing and what
[46:58] therefore
[47:01] that both thou and what
[47:06] God bless the reasons words you may be
[47:08] seated
[47:13] and I was just praying I kind of change
[47:15] what I was going to bring and
[47:18] and his
[47:20] it's your choice this morning
[47:26] it's a lot of things as I was standing
[47:28] over needs and it's your choice
[47:31] it's something simple and may not be
[47:34] very long this morning but
[47:38] it's your choice
[47:41] thought about many uh
[47:44] mistaken and Confused
[47:49] we
[47:51] looked at
[47:53] God versus Satan that's true powers on
[47:56] the Earth
[47:58] but we seemed like we avoided of
[48:01] understanding
[48:03] we don't want to even think
[48:07] that there are two powers on the earth
[48:10] God and Satan
[48:13] we don't want to even acknowledge and
[48:15] sit down and just really
[48:18] consider the matter
[48:21] the day is
[48:23] good and that's evil
[48:28] but when it comes down to
[48:31] people they just take for granted I wake
[48:34] up
[48:35] and I do my thing today
[48:39] whatever I said in my heart to do I just
[48:42] do it
[48:44] not realizing that there's just
[48:48] something that controls us the days
[48:52] to whom you year your members to
[48:57] who you want to serve
[49:00] this morning and you got up and you made
[49:02] your mind up that you wanted to come to
[49:04] the house of the Lord
[49:07] maybe that's the routine
[49:10] maybe we didn't think that
[49:13] the thing that
[49:15] caused you to want to come to the house
[49:17] of the Lord was the spirit of the Lord
[49:21] you could have resist mom and dad you
[49:23] could have resist a husband a wife or
[49:26] any kind of influence
[49:28] but something cause you to
[49:32] come to the house of the Lord and I
[49:34] believe that that was the spirit of the
[49:37] Lord you made a choice
[49:40] you could have said I don't feel good
[49:42] I'm tired I'm weak
[49:45] you could have said you know not today
[49:48] but you made a choice and a decision
[49:50] that I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to God's
[49:52] house
[49:54] and I trust that
[49:57] you would know that that was the right
[49:59] decision
[50:00] that you may
[50:03] be the devil had put all kind of
[50:05] thoughts in your mind and all kind of
[50:07] things are set there for you
[50:10] but you made a choice
[50:15] but I said we ignore
[50:18] oh
[50:19] we don't want to come to grips
[50:24] that we make a choice and a decision
[50:27] whether we're going to serve the Lord
[50:31] or what are we gonna
[50:34] sir the devil
[50:38] some of us feel like
[50:42] that I'm not going to make a decision
[50:43] I'm just going to be in the middle of
[50:45] the road
[50:48] but
[50:50] look at somebody and tell them there's
[50:51] no middle ground
[50:55] there's no middle of the road
[50:59] you either on one side or the other
[51:03] you eat the servant the Lord
[51:06] oh you're serving the devil
[51:09] you're either on the Lord's Side or
[51:11] you're on the devil's side
[51:13] there's no middle of the road
[51:16] but we don't want to face
[51:19] when we look at the Devil he's the
[51:21] prince
[51:23] and the power of the air
[51:26] and he's the spirit did not worketh in
[51:29] the children
[51:31] of disobedience
[51:33] are you with me this morning
[51:36] it's a Powers two Powers which power
[51:39] controls your life
[51:44] which power do you want to control your
[51:47] life
[51:48] what is your desire what is your choice
[51:51] what is your decision
[51:53] have you made a decision
[51:56] are you just sitting around taking and
[51:58] performing
[52:01] and we just don't want to really face
[52:03] the fact
[52:05] we don't want to believe that this is a
[52:08] real that the children saying that one
[52:12] they're fighting
[52:14] they had a wall
[52:16] is that just a song
[52:18] that they sang you just sound good
[52:21] words
[52:23] or do they really realize the impact of
[52:25] what they're saying
[52:27] because nevertheless there's a devil
[52:29] that heard you
[52:32] and that Devil he's saying uh-huh
[52:35] but really whose side are we on
[52:40] whose side are we on
[52:43] brother and sister we got to make a
[52:45] decision in our mind
[52:49] and that to see the Lord
[52:51] if I'm on your side
[52:53] did I know you'll protect me
[52:58] I know you'll bless me
[53:00] he said I sat before you blessing and
[53:02] what
[53:04] mm-hmm
[53:05] your decision that you make will cause
[53:09] you to be blessed
[53:10] or they cause you to
[53:12] be curious
[53:15] yes
[53:17] that's good
[53:20] and there's evil
[53:22] for he said it was a tree in the garden
[53:24] was tree of knowledge of what
[53:27] so he
[53:31] there's something inside of us you know
[53:33] that wants to do the right thing that's
[53:36] the good sign
[53:38] but there's an evil sign
[53:41] that you have to fight that war that
[53:45] goes on within your mind that battle
[53:48] that we are constantly facing that we'll
[53:50] constantly in tune with this battle a
[53:53] will
[53:54] the will of God and the will
[53:57] of man or the will
[54:00] amen
[54:02] said there's a will then us there's a a
[54:05] deep call into the deep there's a will
[54:07] to do the right thing and there's a will
[54:09] to do the wrong thing that's a decision
[54:11] that I might want to Will
[54:15] you know I I want to please do I want to
[54:19] please myself or do I want to please God
[54:23] there's a there's something inside me to
[54:26] make that decision to make that choice
[54:28] who am I trying to please who do I want
[54:30] to please do I want to please in myself
[54:33] uh do I want to please God
[54:37] I have a decision to make a choice to
[54:39] make who who am I trying to please who
[54:42] am I do I want to impress man do I want
[54:46] to impress individuals or do I want the
[54:48] will of God to be done in my life
[54:51] see it's very easy to uh to impress
[54:55] folks
[54:56] but I want you to know that's a real
[54:58] adversary
[55:02] there's a real adversary the Bible calls
[55:05] the devil the average Siri
[55:08] Satan is our adversary
[55:10] he's our foe he's our enemy
[55:14] but is it is it your enemy is he really
[55:17] the your adversary is he really your
[55:20] enemy is that uh uh are you on his side
[55:25] have you yield yourself to that you are
[55:29] actually taking sides not with Jesus but
[55:32] taking sides with Satan
[55:35] because you fail to make a decision in
[55:39] your mind you fail to choose and make
[55:42] the right choice
[55:44] you just sat around and says well I'm
[55:46] gonna be neutral in this
[55:48] there's no neutrality
[55:51] you can't be neutral
[55:54] you just can't be in the middle
[55:57] amen
[55:59] you cannot serve two masters you either
[56:01] loved one and hate the other
[56:04] you have to make a decision
[56:07] and your decision that you make
[56:10] is determine whether you live or you die
[56:16] whether you're blessed or whether you
[56:18] curse
[56:20] whether you're in bondage
[56:23] or whether you're going to be free
[56:27] see because the devil will cause you to
[56:30] be in bondage
[56:32] everything the devil do for you is to
[56:35] hurt you
[56:39] if the devil make you feel good at the
[56:42] end it's gonna hurt
[56:46] if the devil seemed like he's causing
[56:49] things to go wonderful and lovely at the
[56:52] at the end of the road it's a crook in
[56:55] the road
[56:58] are you with me
[56:59] it's something that's going to come out
[57:01] and it ain't gonna come out so pleasant
[57:05] the Devil is a deceiver isn't that right
[57:09] and he's he he's very deceptive
[57:16] but you as a Believer you're not
[57:18] ignorant of Satan devices
[57:22] the devil will wow you he will trick you
[57:25] he will deceive you
[57:28] you must be aware of the Wiles of the
[57:31] devil
[57:32] but savings go in our little mind we
[57:36] don't want to come and contact in the
[57:39] reality of the thing we don't want to
[57:42] sat down and invigilize and realize that
[57:45] we have a real adversary we have two
[57:49] forces in the world and I must make a
[57:51] decision which force or which power or
[57:54] which one I'm going to believe
[57:59] you know
[58:01] he said behold I set before your life
[58:03] and death you choose
[58:05] set before you
[58:08] good and evil you choose
[58:11] as they were they had they made a choice
[58:13] in the Garden of Eden so you make your
[58:16] decision now
[58:19] what are you gonna
[58:21] what kind of decision have you made
[58:25] in Joshua 24
[58:29] it came down to Israel
[58:31] approach to the promised land and they
[58:34] had to make a decision
[58:40] see sometimes we have to check up
[58:46] it comes down to a time that
[58:49] we have to check ourselves and we have
[58:51] to re-establish our faith in Christ
[58:54] Jesus
[58:55] and we have to confirm
[58:57] reaffirm our faith
[59:00] we have to take notice that
[59:03] amen where do I stand with God
[59:08] would I stand this morning
[59:11] have I evaluated my situation
[59:15] have I surveyed and have I uh gave
[59:21] overview did I look
[59:24] and what do I see in my life
[59:30] am I pleasing God is the will of God
[59:33] being wrought in my life
[59:35] am I just you know living now just wake
[59:38] up in the morning and I'm just going
[59:40] through my routine now I'm not really
[59:42] taking it serious I'm not really even
[59:45] worried about a thing because same as
[59:48] though um I I I got food I got a job I
[59:52] got this I got health and I got strength
[59:55] I'm not worried about a thing I'm not
[59:57] even considering I'm just taking
[59:59] everything for granted
[1:00:01] and that is the trick of the enemy the
[1:00:03] devil will have you to take life for
[1:00:07] granted
[1:00:08] my wife's little cousin died she was 16
[1:00:12] years old
[1:00:13] I think she was battling cats and all
[1:00:16] kind of things
[1:00:17] she just died
[1:00:19] but you see what I'm saying you don't
[1:00:21] know when death's gonna meet you
[1:00:26] and then when her
[1:00:27] her cousin's uh I said Keisha was Monica
[1:00:31] is a name and my wife cousins her
[1:00:34] grandma died
[1:00:36] and uh
[1:00:38] she was probably by 80 or so
[1:00:41] anyway
[1:00:42] so that was two deaths in the family but
[1:00:44] you don't know he comes to get the old
[1:00:46] comes to get the you know
[1:00:48] you don't know when your time Gonna Come
[1:00:50] but one thing you could know where
[1:00:52] you're going
[1:00:54] if you happen to leave here where you
[1:00:56] going
[1:00:57] now you're going to make that decision
[1:00:58] now
[1:01:00] when I leave him where where am I going
[1:01:02] to end up
[1:01:04] whether I'm 16 or whether I'm 80. where
[1:01:07] am I going if God called me today where
[1:01:11] am I headed
[1:01:13] oh
[1:01:15] I mean we don't want to face that
[1:01:18] we don't want to make a decision we we
[1:01:21] just want to just wake up in the morning
[1:01:23] go through our routines and just live
[1:01:25] life but we don't want to evaluate hey
[1:01:28] God what is the will of God for me
[1:01:33] God said I sat before you this day
[1:01:36] good and evil I set before your life and
[1:01:39] death I said it before you okay so here
[1:01:42] in um Deuteronomy 24
[1:01:45] and 15.
[1:01:49] uh Joshua excuse me Joshua 24. let's
[1:01:52] just do the 14.
[1:01:54] it says now therefore fill the Lord
[1:01:58] and serve him in what
[1:02:04] that's what
[1:02:05] a lot of people
[1:02:08] are not sincere
[1:02:11] a lot of Christians preachers
[1:02:15] deacons trustees
[1:02:17] musicians singers
[1:02:20] just members loyalty
[1:02:24] not to sincere
[1:02:27] see when you can when you're sincere
[1:02:30] you're giving that extra consideration
[1:02:35] you're giving that carefulness about
[1:02:37] things
[1:02:40] you know you you take it more to Heart
[1:02:45] but when you're not sincere about your
[1:02:48] Christian Journey
[1:02:51] the angel of the Lord told
[1:02:54] the property he got to be more sincere
[1:02:58] with all the miracle signs and Oneness
[1:03:00] that was done in this ministry yet he
[1:03:02] had to be more sincere
[1:03:05] if
[1:03:07] God uses a vessel like that
[1:03:11] and yet he had to be more sincere
[1:03:13] what about you and I when it comes down
[1:03:15] to our journey in this life and where we
[1:03:18] want to go
[1:03:19] into the promise of a rapture
[1:03:23] don't you think that God is one more
[1:03:26] sincerity out of us
[1:03:30] that we need to be more sincere
[1:03:33] about our Christian walk
[1:03:38] consider it brother
[1:03:41] he said that you fear the lord now
[1:03:44] he just didn't leave it there he said
[1:03:47] sir
[1:03:48] the Lord in sincerity
[1:03:51] and in what
[1:03:53] and in truth
[1:03:56] sincerity
[1:03:58] sometimes you hear people just
[1:04:01] just talking and just taking for granted
[1:04:03] just Christians you know like the daisy
[1:04:07] Christian you know I'm a Christian and
[1:04:09] it's just you know
[1:04:11] sometimes we just
[1:04:13] you know Christian by mouth but by
[1:04:15] action what is action
[1:04:18] is that
[1:04:21] in all thy ways what
[1:04:24] acknowledge Him sometimes
[1:04:27] we're forget you know forget to pray
[1:04:31] you know forget to bless our food get
[1:04:33] together Pray when we get in the car we
[1:04:36] get to pray whether you know um you know
[1:04:39] go before we go to work forget to pray
[1:04:42] and forget you know but when you're
[1:04:44] sincere and you checked up
[1:04:48] and you prayed up
[1:04:50] it just seemed like you you're more
[1:04:52] watchful
[1:04:53] you're more careful
[1:04:55] of what is saying how you conduct your
[1:04:57] life
[1:04:58] but if you're not sincere
[1:05:01] you're kind of loose
[1:05:03] you're saying things that you didn't
[1:05:05] know you said because the devil got your
[1:05:07] mouth
[1:05:09] do things that you you know you were
[1:05:12] doing you didn't even know you did it
[1:05:15] you just did it
[1:05:17] but when you're sincere about it you're
[1:05:19] trying to Be watchful
[1:05:21] and trying to be prayerful
[1:05:24] see a lot of times the part of being
[1:05:27] watched for the part of being prideful
[1:05:29] about your walk
[1:05:33] you remember the times of your walk and
[1:05:35] your spiritual walk you you always said
[1:05:37] if the Lord's will
[1:05:41] somebody said can you do this can you do
[1:05:43] that you said yes if it's the Lord's
[1:05:45] will
[1:05:47] but you said well yeah I'm gonna do so
[1:05:49] and so on
[1:05:51] if it's the Lord's will
[1:05:54] you know what I'm saying you almost
[1:05:56] didn't even open your mouth unless you
[1:05:58] said if the Lord's will
[1:06:00] you know what I'm saying there's always
[1:06:02] if it's the will of the Lord because you
[1:06:04] knew that you could you don't control
[1:06:06] things
[1:06:08] are you with me
[1:06:10] so you always dependent on whether it be
[1:06:12] the will of the Lord or not
[1:06:14] but if it wasn't the will of the Lord
[1:06:16] you didn't want to do it
[1:06:18] are you a man
[1:06:19] but sometimes we ignore whether or not
[1:06:22] it's the will of the Lord or not
[1:06:25] we just think if
[1:06:27] if it looked good if it tastes good if
[1:06:30] it feel good then it's good
[1:06:33] you know he said it tastes good it felt
[1:06:36] good and it was good
[1:06:38] good enough that I want Adam to have
[1:06:40] some
[1:06:42] are you with me
[1:06:44] you look good it tastes good
[1:06:47] you know what I'm saying
[1:06:49] So Adam you know and they and all I mean
[1:06:52] y'all see what I'm saying
[1:06:55] a lot of things that look good
[1:06:59] feel good
[1:07:00] and look like a blessing might not be
[1:07:03] the God will
[1:07:06] as God's servant said we try to do God a
[1:07:09] service without it being his will
[1:07:11] would it please God I know to please us
[1:07:14] sometime but is it going to please God
[1:07:16] it's just God's plan for you
[1:07:19] I I mean it might be for somebody else
[1:07:21] but it is it for you
[1:07:24] that God is just what you want me to
[1:07:26] have I don't care what they got is
[1:07:28] whether or not what God wants you to
[1:07:30] have
[1:07:31] are you with me and if God wants you to
[1:07:34] have it you say God let your will be
[1:07:36] done
[1:07:38] are you a bear
[1:07:40] and then if you pray Earnest and
[1:07:43] sincerely about the will of God now if
[1:07:47] it's the will of God then it's going to
[1:07:49] be to the what glory of God
[1:07:54] it's going to glorify not you
[1:07:58] it's going to glorify him
[1:08:01] so in everything God blesses you with
[1:08:04] it's uh it's a testimony
[1:08:08] it's a testament that I want to tell
[1:08:10] amen I'm going to lift it up and say God
[1:08:15] you know I thank the Lord for
[1:08:17] Joshua said Daddy did you know that most
[1:08:21] of the Saints a lot of the young people
[1:08:23] had honors and then in the Urban League
[1:08:26] was calling their names did you know all
[1:08:29] of these people
[1:08:30] a little bright Tabernacles really
[1:08:32] represented
[1:08:34] I said well no they didn't tell me Well
[1:08:37] thank the Lord that they were well
[1:08:39] represented with all these honors
[1:08:41] are you up now
[1:08:43] so uh but it's a testament that they
[1:08:47] could be honored you know what I'm
[1:08:48] saying and it's a blessing that they
[1:08:51] could you know represent Jesus Christ
[1:08:53] and this little assembly amen
[1:08:56] so by the grace of God I'm glad for each
[1:08:59] and every one of them
[1:09:00] you know what I'm saying and uh so a
[1:09:04] body grace of God
[1:09:06] and that just shows you you know God if
[1:09:10] you just you do what God says God will
[1:09:13] bless you
[1:09:15] are you with me
[1:09:16] but you use it not to just that an Urban
[1:09:19] League can recognize you but that you

[1:09:35] of letting the light shine on Jesus

[1:09:43] blessings that he gives to you give God

[1:09:59] bless you with is to give him glory
[1:10:02] are you with me
[1:10:04] choices
[1:10:07] sincerely in truth
[1:10:09] and he said and put away the gods which
[1:10:13] your father served on the other side of
[1:10:16] the flood
[1:10:17] and in Egypt
[1:10:20] are you with me
[1:10:24] and Sir ye what
[1:10:27] serve you the Lord
[1:10:30] the 15th verse and if it seemed what
[1:10:34] even to you Lord
[1:10:38] serve the Lord
[1:10:40] choose what
[1:10:42] I said the choice is yours
[1:10:45] and today I said I was going to be
[1:10:48] shocked now I might cut off in a minute
[1:10:51] the choice is yours
[1:10:54] are you with me
[1:10:55] the decision you make today
[1:10:59] you know I thank God for these young
[1:11:00] people representing
[1:11:03] but the choice is yours
[1:11:06] are you with me
[1:11:08] the choice is yours whether or not
[1:11:10] you're going to represent Jesus Christ
[1:11:11] in the light
[1:11:13] of a Christian wall
[1:11:17] I had some testimonies in some young
[1:11:19] people
[1:11:21] and some of the young sisters never wore
[1:11:24] uh uh uh pants always will address the
[1:11:29] school
[1:11:31] the young man came to church one night
[1:11:33] and he says I'm looking for a certain
[1:11:35] young sister and it's probably five or
[1:11:39] six years out of school
[1:11:42] he said a girl that wrote a dress all
[1:11:44] the time
[1:11:46] didn't know she was wearing pants now
[1:11:50] you know
[1:11:52] and he but he was looking for her
[1:11:55] see the light had shined she represented
[1:11:59] oh you're a man
[1:12:01] now she might have been going through
[1:12:03] her struggles
[1:12:04] but by the grace of God she represented
[1:12:06] then
[1:12:08] and the young man you know years after
[1:12:10] people remember
[1:12:12] that your light shine
[1:12:14] oh you're whipping
[1:12:16] what you what you what kind of light or
[1:12:19] what kind of influence you want to have
[1:12:21] on young people
[1:12:22] in your school
[1:12:25] what kind of influence have you
[1:12:29] with everybody else is
[1:12:32] rocking and rolling
[1:12:37] and they're doing things that
[1:12:40] against the Lord Jesus Christ what
[1:12:43] choice would you make
[1:12:46] when you face
[1:12:48] somebody said face the music
[1:12:50] when you're faced with it what choice
[1:12:52] would you make
[1:12:55] are you with me
[1:12:57] I'm glad that
[1:13:01] here Joshua said choose you to say who
[1:13:06] whom you would serve whether
[1:13:09] the gods which your father served on the
[1:13:12] other side of the flood other God are
[1:13:16] the gods of the amorites and whose land
[1:13:19] you dwell but as for what
[1:13:24] we were what
[1:13:27] you made a decision I'm gonna serve the
[1:13:30] Lord
[1:13:31] and I'm gonna tell you something it is
[1:13:34] sometimes it don't look like it's gonna
[1:13:36] it's gonna be easy
[1:13:38] matter of fact the devil make you look
[1:13:40] real real real real difficult
[1:13:43] it's easy to
[1:13:46] you know to do the things that's going
[1:13:48] to please the devil and make it easy for
[1:13:51] you to do the things that's wrong
[1:13:55] and nobody gonna give you a hard time
[1:13:57] and you know they call you all kind of
[1:13:59] names
[1:14:00] you know some of the things uh
[1:14:03] I remember my
[1:14:04] Sons used to go through young people
[1:14:07] calling them all kind of stuff and
[1:14:10] you know I'm gonna tell you people will
[1:14:12] pick at you call y'all kind of names as
[1:14:15] a young Christian young girl you go
[1:14:18] through things
[1:14:21] people are despise you and put pressure
[1:14:24] on you
[1:14:26] you go through things
[1:14:29] then you got to make a decision
[1:14:31] Lord if I suffer as a Christian
[1:14:35] as a Christian
[1:14:37] then he said happy are you
[1:14:41] are you with me but you got to make that
[1:14:42] decision do you want to do it
[1:14:46] see if you don't want to do it
[1:14:48] it makes it 10 times harder
[1:14:52] when you don't want to do it
[1:14:55] and one day you're gonna break the cycle
[1:14:58] One Day You're Gonna you're gonna uh-uh
[1:15:01] when it becomes so hard
[1:15:04] sometimes it's gonna be unbearable for
[1:15:07] you to do
[1:15:10] but he said my yoke is easy
[1:15:13] and my bird of his life
[1:15:16] see God once you make a decision for the
[1:15:18] Lord
[1:15:19] then God will take the load
[1:15:22] that heavy logo
[1:15:24] the burdens
[1:15:26] he said cast all your what
[1:15:28] your burden your cares upon me
[1:15:31] because I care for you
[1:15:34] I'ma tell you
[1:15:36] God said greater is he that's what
[1:15:40] see your decision that you make calls an
[1:15:42] inward power to be inside you to give
[1:15:46] you the ability to walk to Walk
[1:15:50] and to live the life
[1:15:52] see it's because of the decision that
[1:15:54] you make calls the spirit of God to come
[1:15:57] down in The Believer
[1:15:59] to give them amen that you don't walk by
[1:16:02] your own might or your own strength or
[1:16:04] your own ability
[1:16:06] because you made a decision
[1:16:09] Lord I want to please you
[1:16:11] and because you want to please God
[1:16:14] and not yourself and not the world not
[1:16:16] the devil
[1:16:18] amen God gives you the strength
[1:16:20] whatever your face or whatever your
[1:16:22] battle is he said I'll never
[1:16:26] leave you and I'll never
[1:16:29] I'm gonna tell you when you get in some
[1:16:31] tough places the devil sure will leave

[1:16:39] leave you
[1:16:40] friends will forsake you
[1:16:43] amen praise God sometimes mama will do
[1:16:46] it and daddy will do it and sister and
[1:16:48] brother would do it but God said I was
[1:16:52] I never leave you
[1:16:54] and I won't forsake you but I'll be with
[1:16:57] you

[1:17:38] not the other one
[1:17:40] but God would be there for you are you
[1:17:43] with me
[1:17:45] so as I close in this last verse uh 11
[1:17:49] and 25 Hebrews 11 25.
[1:17:55] it talks about Moses
[1:17:57] in the 24th verse he said by faith Moses
[1:18:01] when
[1:18:02] he was coming to years refused to be
[1:18:04] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:18:07] you got to make a decision a choice that
[1:18:09] you got to make
[1:18:11] it's your choice this morning
[1:18:14] I mean he had opportunity to be a great
[1:18:18] person in life
[1:18:20] greatness was set before him and
[1:18:22] and he had everything before him
[1:18:26] to be the ruler of the world was right
[1:18:29] at his
[1:18:31] it ran his feet I I I got to listen you
[1:18:35] know some of us you know the devil don't
[1:18:38] have to give us much
[1:18:40] the devil don't have to get some folk
[1:18:42] much he gave Judas 30 pieces of water
[1:18:46] civil and that was enough for him to
[1:18:48] what
[1:18:50] betray Jesus isn't that right
[1:18:53] what did what did the devil offer you
[1:18:57] what is he offering you
[1:19:00] I said what did the devil offering you
[1:19:04] I don't know brothers and sisters
[1:19:07] something I just can't hear me this
[1:19:09] morning
[1:19:10] but what does the devil offered you what
[1:19:12] did he offer you
[1:19:14] because you the one
[1:19:18] to serve him
[1:19:21] because you don't want to live for him
[1:19:24] you can't serve two masses
[1:19:27] now he said Moses made a decision
[1:19:31] have you made your decision yet
[1:19:34] oh you think I'm too young to make a
[1:19:36] decision
[1:19:38] I said have you made a decision yet
[1:19:42] I'm giving you the opportunity to make a
[1:19:44] decision who you want to serve
[1:19:48] I'm giving you the opportunity to make a
[1:19:51] heartfelt do you believe that God is
[1:19:54] real and that Jesus died on the cross
[1:19:56] for your sin and that he shedded his
[1:19:59] Precious Blood and that he came to give
[1:20:01] you eternal life
[1:20:04] do you believe that
[1:20:06] sincerely with all of your heart do you
[1:20:09] believe that God
[1:20:12] loves you and cares about you and wants
[1:20:17] to give you the best of life
[1:20:19] he wants to bless you
[1:20:21] if you believe that with all your heart
[1:20:24] then I ask you
[1:20:26] to make the right choice this morning
[1:20:30] 25 it says
[1:20:32] Moses made a decision choosing what
[1:20:36] the what
[1:20:39] with the what
[1:20:41] who do you want to be with the people of
[1:20:42] God
[1:20:44] oh you want to stay with with Egypt
[1:20:47] the people in the world
[1:20:50] do you want to suffer with the people of
[1:20:52] God or do you want to live out there and
[1:20:55] party and do all kind of stuff and
[1:20:59] decision is yours the choice is yours
[1:21:01] and if you die you want to go to heaven
[1:21:03] don't you
[1:21:04] don't you want to be with the Lord don't
[1:21:06] you want all the treats of gold there's
[1:21:09] no more crying no more dying oh he's
[1:21:11] with the Lord now she's with the Lord
[1:21:13] now what Lord
[1:21:16] they made any decision while they were
[1:21:18] living
[1:21:20] oh I can see
[1:21:24] so-and-so singing with the angels son
[1:21:27] with the devil while he was here
[1:21:30] and it's angry with the angels now
[1:21:33] they made a decision
[1:21:35] oh I know he's he's an angel now oh Lord
[1:21:42] it was an angel yeah Angel of Darkness
[1:21:46] not of life
[1:21:48] are you with me
[1:21:50] you see what I'm saying it sounds good
[1:21:54] it sounds soothing and relaxing but the
[1:21:57] chart that they made they wanted to
[1:21:59] party they wanted to live it up they
[1:22:01] wanted to do the things Amen to God said
[1:22:04] not to do he said they made their own
[1:22:07] choice while they were living
[1:22:10] but when they die you know what I'm
[1:22:12] saying everybody want to go to heaven
[1:22:15] but nobody want to die
[1:22:17] now
