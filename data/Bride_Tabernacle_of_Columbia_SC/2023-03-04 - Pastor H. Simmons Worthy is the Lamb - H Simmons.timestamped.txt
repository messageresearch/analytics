[29:04] now bless your word today in Jesus
[29:08] Christ's name we pray amen
[29:12] we're going back to Revelation 5 again
[29:14] and
[29:29] Revelation 5 and 1 and and I sow in the
[29:32] right hand of him that set upon the
[29:34] throne a book written within and on the
[29:38] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[29:41] saw a strong angel proclaiming with the
[29:43] loud voice he was worried to open the
[29:45] book and the loose the seals thereof and
[29:49] no man in heaven and nor in the earth
[29:52] neither under the Earth was able to open
[29:55] the book neither to loose
[29:58] look upon their upon
[30:01] and I wept much because no man was found
[30:06] worthy to open and to read the book
[30:09] neither to look there on
[30:13] and one of the elders said unto me wheat
[30:16] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[30:19] Judah the root of David has prevailed to
[30:22] open the book and to loose the Seven
[30:25] Seals thereof
[30:27] and I beheld and low
[30:30] in the midst of the throne and of the
[30:33] four beasts and in the midst of the
[30:36] elders stood and lamb as it had been
[30:40] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[30:44] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[30:48] forth unto the all that Earth
[30:50] and he came and took the book out of the
[30:55] right hand of him that set it upon the
[30:58] throne then the 12th verse
[31:01] sin with the loud voice
[31:04] Worthy is the Lamb
[31:07] that was slain to receive power
[31:10] and
[31:12] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[31:17] and glory and blessing may God bless the
[31:20] reasons worship may be seated
[31:24] Worthy
[31:26] tonight is the Lamb
[31:29] praise God
[31:31] you know I was
[31:33] just saying which direction we're going
[31:36] and where did the lamb and
[31:39] I was thanking the lord for
[31:42] the Lamb of God is not just a song that
[31:45] was saying but
[31:47] it expresses
[31:53] something that
[31:55] should be magnified and
[31:57] that the lamb is truly worthy and what
[32:00] does it why is it that we say He's
[32:04] Worthy
[32:06] and then he said
[32:08] in that verse he said words of the Lamb
[32:11] that was slain
[32:12] so he was slain
[32:15] and we understand that
[32:17] the devil's a price
[32:20] for mankind
[32:21] when there was nobody Worthy
[32:25] in heaven nobody in Earth on the Earth
[32:28] was Worthy
[32:31] then he said the Worthy is the Lamb
[32:33] that was slain
[32:35] amen
[32:37] he paid the price
[32:39] the price of redemption here
[32:42] Isaiah looked at it in Isaiah 53
[32:46] and seven he says
[32:49] he was a press
[32:51] and he was afflicted
[32:54] yet
[32:56] open not
[32:58] his mouth
[33:01] he was bored as a lamb to the slaughter
[33:06] and as a sheep before her Sheriff
[33:11] is dumb
[33:14] so he opened not his mouth
[33:18] he was taken from prison
[33:21] and from judgment
[33:23] and who shall declare his generation
[33:26] for he was cut off
[33:28] out of the land of the living
[33:31] for the transgression
[33:34] of my people was he stricken
[33:38] I'm saying
[33:40] and then he said he made his grave with
[33:43] the wicked
[33:45] and with the rich and his death
[33:49] because he had done no violence
[33:52] neither was any deceit
[33:54] in his mouth
[33:56] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[34:00] it's something about
[34:02] the Lamb of God and what he's done for
[34:05] us
[34:07] and what he died for us
[34:11] the book of Philippians 2
[34:14] it teaches us that
[34:16] here it says in Revelation
[34:19] 12 he said words of the Lamb that were
[34:21] slain to receive power
[34:25] riches
[34:26] wisdom strength honor glory and blessing
[34:31] amen
[34:33] I think he deserves
[34:36] all of that
[34:38] and more
[34:40] because
[34:43] the prophet said that book
[34:46] was the book of redemption
[34:50] and he takes it as the abstract kind of
[34:53] deed
[34:54] to redeem us to get it back
[34:56] what was taken from Adam
[35:01] but as the price had to be paid for the
[35:03] book to be returned
[35:08] for all your rights
[35:10] the event your redempted rights
[35:13] the price had to be paid
[35:17] it was locked into a roof in Naomi
[35:21] in the Book of Ruth and Boaz
[35:24] went forward with the type of Christ
[35:27] you had to be the next of kin
[35:29] man Redeemer
[35:31] so I ain't just couldn't do it
[35:34] you had to be a kinsman redeemer
[35:37] somebody that was kin
[35:40] probably God had bought her it had to be
[35:42] a human being
[35:43] had to be a human
[35:46] the civil liberties
[35:48] tells us
[35:53] it says
[35:56] Philippians 2.
[35:59] he said if there'd be any consolation in
[36:02] Christ if any confident love and many
[36:05] fellowship with the spirit if any bowels
[36:07] of Mercy fulfill you my joy that you be
[36:10] like-minded having the Same Love
[36:13] being the one Accord
[36:15] one mind
[36:17] I said all you can look at is the love
[36:19] of God
[36:21] when you look at
[36:23] the Lamb of God that was worthy all you
[36:25] can look at the grace that God Express
[36:29] that was God's grace
[36:31] instead of God's judgment for us
[36:35] he was taken away the Judgment that
[36:40] we will do the judgment
[36:44] none of us are worthy
[36:47] of salvation
[36:49] but by the grace of God
[36:52] Jesus Christ
[36:54] amen made you and I worthy
[36:58] because the lamb
[37:00] was Worthy
[37:02] as we said
[37:04] in the Old Testament they bought a lamb
[37:06] without blemish
[37:08] and so forth and they brought it before
[37:09] the Austin they played that laid their
[37:12] hands on the lamb
[37:13] and their sins were supposed to be
[37:15] transferred unto that lamb
[37:19] amen when they because the wages of sin
[37:22] is what death
[37:24] but that lamb blood was animal blood
[37:29] so it had to be akinatory demon so that
[37:31] animal blood can only cover sin
[37:35] is it was a substitute
[37:38] until the real lamb came
[37:41] are you with me
[37:43] so we had a substitute
[37:47] amen
[37:48] but it was speaking of something that
[37:51] was to come the Old Testament was
[37:53] telling us something is coming there was
[37:56] a shadow of things to come
[37:58] so by the grace of God this lamb that
[38:02] they laid their hands on and
[38:05] their sins were covered
[38:07] now the Lamb of God come Amen to restore
[38:12] redempted rights
[38:15] everything that Adam lost in the garden
[38:18] Adam and Eve lost
[38:21] redempted rights says that I come to
[38:24] redeem not only you amen but to give you
[38:29] back your rights
[38:32] give you back amen your Authority and
[38:36] the power amen that Adam had
[38:39] before the fall
[38:41] So Adam and Eve was they were powerful
[38:44] they had
[38:45] Dominion
[38:48] they had power they had Authority
[38:52] praise God they could speak and what
[38:54] they said would come to pass
[38:57] amen
[38:58] they had spoken word power
[39:01] that was more powerful than the nuclear
[39:04] bombs that they are threatening the
[39:05] World by
[39:08] they're trying to hold back to nuclear
[39:10] war hold back the third wall whoa
[39:14] everybody's trying to hold that back
[39:17] and the world is on edge right now
[39:20] as China and Russia they said trying to
[39:23] come together everybody's on edge
[39:26] but brother and sister nothing can keep
[39:29] us but the blood of the Lamb
[39:33] nothing can keep you but the Blood on
[39:35] the doorpost and on the linen
[39:38] because he said when I see the blood
