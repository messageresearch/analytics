[36:13] Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have
[36:17] your Bibles this morning I'd like to you
[36:19] turn to the Book of Luke
[36:23] Luke chapter 15.
[36:35] when we start at verse 11.
[36:41] very familiar scripture if you got it
[36:43] say man
[36:45] amen and it reads Luke chapter 15 verse
[36:48] 11 and he said a certain man had two
[36:51] sons and the younger of them said to his
[36:54] father father give me the portion of
[36:56] goods that followed to me and he divided
[37:00] unto them his living and not many days
[37:02] after the youngest son gathered all
[37:04] together and took his journey into a far
[37:07] country and there wasted his substance
[37:09] with righteous living
[37:12] and when he had spent all there arose a
[37:15] mighty famine in that land and he began
[37:18] to be in want
[37:20] and when he went and joined himself to a
[37:22] citizen of that country
[37:24] and he sent for sent him into this field
[37:27] to feed swine and he would feign have
[37:31] filled his belly with the husk that the
[37:33] swan did eat and no man gave unto him
[37:37] and when he came to himself he said how
[37:40] many hired Servants of my fathers have
[37:43] bred enough to end to Spirit I perish in
[37:47] our Parish with Hunger I will arise and
[37:49] go to my father and will say unto him
[37:52] father I have sinned against heaven and
[37:54] before thee amen God bless the reading
[37:57] of this word may be seated amen
[38:01] amen I like to speak on a little
[38:04] topic this morning said if not now then
[38:08] when
[38:10] if not now then when and look at verse
[38:13] 15 and verse 6 15 he said and he went
[38:17] and joined himself to citizen of that
[38:19] country he was sent him into the field
[38:22] to feed swine in verse 16 he would feign
[38:25] to fill his belly with the hust that the
[38:28] swan did eat and no man gave unto him
[38:31] and I was looking at description it came
[38:34] to me if not now then when and this if
[38:38] you know the story it was about we call
[38:40] it the prodigal son and there were two
[38:42] sons and one he went out and he lived
[38:44] his life but he got into hard times and
[38:47] he had to make a decision he had to
[38:49] decide whether he wanted to do what was
[38:52] right or continue to live the way that
[38:54] he was and I want to ask you the
[38:56] question if not now then when when is it
[38:59] going to be your time that you're going
[39:00] to turn and say I want to do what's
[39:03] right when is going to be the
[39:05] appropriate time for you to decide that
[39:07] I want to do what's right and as a
[39:09] subtopic I put down I said examine
[39:11] yourself
[39:12] see where you are and understand this
[39:15] young man he had to go through a time
[39:17] and he said he said I'm out here feeding
[39:20] the pigs I'm out here doing this and in
[39:23] my father's house this even the servants
[39:26] have food enough to spare he examined
[39:28] himself and he said why am I doing this
[39:31] why am I where I am today he was
[39:34] examining himself and he asked he might
[39:36] have asked himself the question if not
[39:38] now then when when is it going to be the
[39:41] import the time for me to turn when is
[39:44] it going to be the time for me to return
[39:46] to my father's house if not now and I'll
[39:49] come to this Crossroads where I'm out
[39:51] here and I don't have nothing to eat I
[39:53] want to eat with the pigs to eat now I
[39:54] know that's not good for me and he's
[39:56] saying if not now then when when am I
[39:59] going to turn to him when am I going to
[40:01] say that I need help when am I going to
[40:04] decide that I've done enough and that
[40:06] this is my turning point and each
[40:08] turning point is different he got down
[40:10] to his lowest moment
[40:12] but there are some examples of people
[40:14] that didn't get there but they realized
[40:16] they needed help
[40:18] see if not now then when it said in
[40:22] Ezekiel he said remember now God created
[40:24] in the days of thy youth if you turn to
[40:27] Ezekiel because I want to read the read
[40:29] the full scripture Ezekiel chapter 12
[40:37] verse 1.
[40:43] Ezekiel chapter 12 and verse 1.
[40:48] it says remember now thy Creator in the
[40:51] days of thy used while the evil days
[40:53] come not nor the years draw nigh when
[40:56] thou shalt say I not have no pleasure in
[40:59] him
[41:00] and while the Sun or the light of the
[41:02] moon or the Stars be not dark in nor the
[41:04] clouds returning to the Rain
[41:07] in the days when the keepers of the
[41:09] house shall tremble and the strong men
[41:10] shall bow themselves and the grinder
[41:12] cease because they are few and those
[41:15] that look out on the Windows be darkened
[41:16] and the door shall be shut in the
[41:18] streets when the sounds of grinding is
[41:21] low and he shall rise up at the voice of
[41:23] the birds and all the daughters of music
[41:25] shall be brought low
[41:28] and
[41:33] and let's drop down to the 13th board
[41:35] verse
[41:37] and he said let us hear the conclusion
[41:39] of the whole matter fear God and keep
[41:42] his Commandments but this is the whole
[41:44] duty of man for God shall bring every
[41:46] work into judgment with every secret
[41:49] thing whether it be good or whether it
[41:51] be evil
[41:52] see here it says and sometimes it says
[41:55] examine yourself if not now then when it
[41:58] says that God's going to judge every man
[42:00] with every secret thing whether it be
[42:03] good or whether it be evil so he gives
[42:05] you an opportunity to come to him to
[42:07] turn to him and to see and ask you the
[42:11] question if not now then when if not now
[42:14] if this isn't the moment then when it's
[42:16] going to be a good moment for you to
[42:17] turn when are you when is it going to be
[42:19] a good moment if this is not the moment
[42:21] then when when are you when it's going
[42:24] to be a good turn for you to examine
[42:26] yourself for you to see it say that I
[42:29] need to do right I need to do better and
[42:31] examine yourself and say lord it's me
[42:34] it's not anybody else it's me oh Lord
[42:36] standing in the need of prayer not just
[42:39] my mother my father but it's me
[42:40] sometimes we look at everyone else and
[42:43] we can see everyone else's faults but we
[42:45] can't see our own because we never
[42:47] examine ourselves because we never ask
[42:50] ourselves is it time for me to turn is
[42:52] the time for me to go in a different
[42:54] direction maybe everyone else is going
[42:56] and that may seem right for them
[42:58] but it's not it's not right for you
[43:01] it's and it says
[43:04] I wrote something down and said here
[43:06] that says it's easy to slide down a hill
[43:09] but it takes strength and resolve to
[43:11] climb up it
[43:12] sometimes it's easy when you're going
[43:14] downhill it's easy to run fast it takes
[43:17] a lot more strength and takes a lot of
[43:20] the heart to run up a hill you got to
[43:22] struggle sometimes you got to focus on
[43:25] times you got to figure out where am I
[43:26] going to put my feet and and where am I
[43:29] going to this might not be solid ground
[43:31] but I want to stand on Solid Ground and
[43:34] says sometimes the devil make it seems
[43:36] easy to say yes to sin and the more you
[43:39] say yes the easier it becomes and the
[43:42] faster you slide and the harder it
[43:43] becomes to stop
[43:45] but no one can cause you to stop
[43:48] but no one can cause you to stop and
[43:50] start climbing back up
[43:52] even though the hill is steep you don't
[43:54] have to depend on your strength and you
[43:57] can depend on the one who said I will
[43:59] never leave you nor forsake you
[44:01] I Am With You Always even until the end
[44:04] of the world see sometimes when you're
[44:06] sliding down the hill it's easy and and
[44:09] it becomes easier the worthy you slide
[44:12] because you get faster you get faster
[44:14] the longer you slide you get faster if
[44:16] it's a big enough Hill you keep going
[44:18] and you get faster and they feel good
[44:19] the wind blowing in your face and you're
[44:21] going you're going but it's hard to stop
[44:25] but all it takes is one moment
[44:28] just for you to ask yourself if not now
[44:30] then when is enough enough when is
[44:33] enough enough when am I going to say no
[44:36] when am I going to say no when am I
[44:38] going to stop and think about when is
[44:40] enough enough when am I going to think
[44:43] about
[44:44] if not now then when when am I going to
[44:47] ask myself when is my stopping point
[44:51] because you you continue to go and you
[44:54] continue to go and you continue to go
[44:56] it's hard to say no it's hard to stop
[45:00] once you go down certain Journeys and
[45:02] certain Pathways and that's why I came
[45:04] to the scripture remember now that I
[45:06] created in the days of thy youth because
[45:08] it's easier when you're in your youth
[45:10] it's easier because of the exposure that
[45:12] you have in life and God allows you to
[45:15] to choose him now that ask yourself if
[45:18] not now then when why are you young you
[45:21] haven't been exposed and you can't
[45:22] return from things that you've done and
[45:25] God God allows you to say choose him
[45:27] down choose him now you can examine
[45:29] yourself and say Lord I want you now I
[45:33] want to make the decision if not I want
[45:34] to make today is my win today is my
[45:38] turning point today is an opportunity
[45:40] for me
[45:42] to change and grow from where I am and
[45:45] said something I used to hear when I
[45:47] when I was growing up the older people
[45:49] they would say that
[45:52] they would say there was something that
[45:54] I wrote down and said the devil will
[45:55] take you further than you ever thought
[45:57] you would go
[45:58] the devil will take you further that you
[46:00] ever thought you would go because he
[46:02] takes you on a journey down a hill
[46:04] he never tells you that when you get to
[46:06] the bottom there's a lake of fire he
[46:08] never tells you that once you slide down
[46:10] farther enough the fire is going to get
[46:12] hotter and hotter and you can't climb
[46:13] back up you can't get out of that Hill
[46:15] once you go there but Jesus Is providing
[46:18] a way of Escape he's inviting a way to
[46:21] say that that if you stop I'm going to
[46:24] help you climb back up that hill I'm
[46:26] gonna carry you up the hill where you
[46:28] thought it was your strength but it was
[46:29] his strength where you thought it was
[46:31] you was going to do it and he said I'm
[46:33] going to bring you through it it was him
[46:35] that was carrying you that's going to
[46:37] lead you and guide you up that hill see
[46:39] but the devil makes it easier he tries
[46:41] to make it easier and something I used
[46:43] to hear that I wrote down and said that
[46:45] if you lie you were still
[46:47] they used to say if you then if you're
[46:49] still you were killed and people's like
[46:52] why why are you being so dramatic that's
[46:54] not how it happens what what I wrote
[46:56] down and said but sometimes you don't
[46:58] know where the simplest things can lead
[47:01] because as you go each time you make a
[47:03] wrong decision it's like sliding down a
[47:06] hill it becomes easier and anything that
[47:10] you practice anything that you do often
[47:12] enough it's like practicing it you're
[47:14] gonna get better at it you're gonna get
[47:16] better at it even wrong things you're
[47:17] gonna get better at it because it
[47:19] becomes easier to you because you're
[47:21] sliding down a hill that you seem that
[47:23] you can't stop on and it becomes easier
[47:26] to you as you go when you keep going
[47:29] but the smallest things you never know
[47:31] what I can leave and people's like well
[47:34] well for example I'll give you an
[47:35] example
[47:36] saying well I only took a dollar out the
[47:39] purse my mama purse
[47:42] so and people just well that was nothing
[47:45] all I wanted was some candy and she said
[47:47] no so I only took a dollar that was an
[47:50] example but no one ever told you that
[47:52] one day you may end up robbing bigger
[47:55] and better things
[47:56] because of one simple decision that you
[47:59] made when you were young one simple
[48:01] decision that you made that you said
[48:03] well that's not where it's going to go
[48:05] but then if if you keep going you're
[48:07] going to get better at it that's why
[48:09] they said stay away from Evil things
[48:11] stay out of ways of trouble that's why
[48:14] people lead you and guide you and say
[48:15] this is the right way don't do these
[48:17] certain things that's why God put laws
[48:19] in the Bible that we wouldn't do certain
[48:22] things so that we could stay away from
[48:24] sliding down those those Hills sliding
[48:27] down the hill where we couldn't return
[48:29] from
[48:30] and wonder why we got to where we are
[48:33] but there's
[48:34] this is just an example of one small
[48:37] thing that can lead to so many greater
[48:39] things
[48:40] because once you do something and you
[48:42] repeat it you become better at it and it
[48:44] becomes easier to do so make sure that
[48:47] you're doing the right things ask
[48:49] yourself if not now then when
[48:51] ask yourself you might get away with it
[48:54] now but one day it'll catch up to you
[48:56] what's done in the dark one day it'll
[48:58] come to the light one day it's going to
[49:00] come before you and you're going to have
[49:01] to face the Judgment for the sins that
[49:03] you have done whether on Earth or in
[49:06] heaven it's going to come that day and
[49:08] you're going to have to face it well
[49:10] Lord Lord and he going to play it before
[49:12] you and say did you do this and there's
[49:14] no way you can deny it so if not now
[49:17] then when when are you going to make the
[49:19] positive decision that I want to do
[49:21] better will it be tomorrow will it be
[49:24] next week will it be 10 years from now
[49:26] but what if you don't have that time
[49:29] what if you don't have the time to make
[49:31] that decision in the future
[49:33] what if today is your last day what is
[49:36] this moment after this service is over
[49:38] for you
[49:41] and you no longer get to ask yourself
[49:43] if not now then when you don't get to
[49:46] examine yourself anymore because you're
[49:48] no longer here
[49:50] you no longer can breathe you no longer
[49:52] can do the things that you think that
[49:54] I'm young and I'm strong or I got plenty
[49:57] of time if not now then when when are
[50:00] you going to change
[50:01] when are you going to decide that enough
[50:03] is enough when are you going to say to
[50:06] yourself that
[50:07] I got to do something different
[50:09] I got to make this positive decision to
[50:12] do something different because today is
[50:14] my win this is my moment to change
[50:24] this is my moment when I can decide that
[50:26] Lord I want you to do something in my
[50:28] life Lord I want you to do something I
[50:31] want you to do something for me to
[50:33] change the way that I am I said a long
[50:35] time ago I caught a revelation I said
[50:37] you should only change for two people
[50:40] God and yourself
[50:42] because those are the only changes that
[50:43] that are last those are the only changes
[50:46] that when you make them you for yourself
[50:48] you try to make them last as long as
[50:50] possible but when God changes you
[50:53] there's nothing that you can do to
[50:54] reverse that one but you gotta want the
[50:57] change you gotta want to if you're
[50:59] sliding down the hill you gotta want to
[51:00] stop you got to want to make that
[51:02] positive decision that said this is my
[51:05] moment to make a decision that I'm I'm
[51:07] not going to do this anymore and even if
[51:10] you give it to God and say Lord you help
[51:12] me because I'm not strong enough to keep
[51:15] me from doing it myself I'm not strong
[51:17] enough to do this I'm not strong enough
[51:19] to to not do this Lord I need your help
[51:22] and God I know for sure that he will
[51:25] help you if you give it to him I'm a
[51:27] living witness that God will help you
[51:29] God will keep you God will if you give
[51:32] it to him he said what you buying on her
[51:34] I will bind in heaven he said what you
[51:36] loose on Earth I will loosen heaven so
[51:38] if you give it to him and say Lord I'm
[51:40] binding this and this is in your hands
[51:42] and God to take care of it God will help
[51:44] you through it he'll give you the
[51:45] strength he'll give you the result he'll
[51:48] give you the determination to make it
[51:50] through it he'll make sure that you have
[51:52] you have everything that you need to get
[51:54] through it and that little voice to come
[51:56] to you when you buy to do it and say no
[51:59] don't do this
[52:00] don't do this don't go don't go don't
[52:04] slide no more don't go back now don't
[52:06] take two steps backwards when God done
[52:08] brought you two steps forward God he
[52:11] gives you that voice something in you
[52:12] that says don't do that think about it
[52:15] don't do that look how far you come look
[52:18] how far he's brought you don't do that
[52:21] but you have to examine yourself you
[52:23] have to say what and make that decision
[52:26] for yourself or whether you want to
[52:28] slide further
[52:29] whether you want to go back down that
[52:31] Hill from when she came because you know
[52:33] which way that's going
[52:35] you know if you keep sliding you know
[52:37] where that's going
[52:38] you know it's not you may not know
[52:40] exactly where it may end up but you know
[52:42] it won't end up in a good thing you know
[52:44] it won't end up where you think it may
[52:46] end up in a positive direction
[52:50] if you continue to go at some point in
[52:52] time you got to ask yourself if not now
[52:55] then when if not now if this isn't my
[52:58] moment for change then when it will be
[53:00] my moment will it be next week will it
[53:02] be 10 years from now but what if you
[53:04] don't have the time
[53:06] what if you don't have the time that you
[53:08] think you do what it what if tomorrow
[53:11] Putin decides that he wants to start a
[53:13] nuclear war and you don't have that time
[53:16] what are tomorrow tomorrow you wake up
[53:19] and people are gone that you once
[53:21] remember what what what if that those
[53:23] moments happen and you don't have the
[53:25] time to examine yourself anymore
[53:28] you don't have the time to say I got so
[53:30] much more time to live before these days
[53:33] happen I got so much more time to live
[53:36] before these things take place that's
[53:39] why we all have to examine ourselves
[53:40] daily and say Lord if not now then when
[53:45] when am I going to when am I going to
[53:48] believe that God would do what he said
[53:50] he would do when am I going to believe
[53:52] Lord that you're going to do exactly
[53:54] what you promised to do in your in your
[53:56] word Lord you promise to heal Lord you
[53:59] promised to deliver you promised to set
[54:01] free Lord you promised to to to save
[54:05] those that need to be saved Lord you
[54:07] promise to do these things so if not now
[54:10] then then when when can I believe that
[54:14] God will fulfill his promises to me when
[54:17] can I believe that God will fulfill his
[54:19] promises to me I don't have to wait for
[54:21] a long future I can believe now I can
[54:24] believe now that God will do what he
[54:26] said he will do yeah I can believe now
[54:28] that God will do exactly what he said he
[54:31] would do in his word because he said
[54:33] that if his word came out of his mouth
[54:35] it can't return to him void and James he
[54:38] says faith without works is dead so even
[54:41] though you may have faith you still got
[54:43] to put in the works even though you may
[54:45] believe you still got to do something
[54:47] you got to enact on that Faith say Lord
[54:49] I believe in you but I got to have some
[54:51] actions behind it I got to say Lord if
[54:54] not now then when when am I going to put
[54:56] my actions behind my face
[54:58] when am I going to do and truly believe
[55:00] that all things are possible if I only
[55:03] believe all things are possible if I
[55:05] only believe so if not now then when I
[55:09] need to examine myself and say Lord
[55:11] examine me David said created me a clean
[55:14] heart oh Lord and renew a right Spirit
[55:16] In Me
[55:17] and Paul said I Die daily it's something
[55:20] that we have to do is examine ourselves
[55:22] and ask ourselves if not now then when
[55:25] if not now then when
[55:28] all it takes is you believing and acting
[55:31] on it and God can do more it can do
[55:34] exceedingly abundantly then we can ask
[55:36] other things all it takes is you
[55:38] believing and acting on it and God can
[55:41] do exceedingly abundantly that we can
[55:44] ask or think all it takes is you
[55:46] believing and acting on it see that's
[55:49] sometimes we believe but we don't act
[55:52] sometimes we act but we don't believe
[55:55] but it takes the combination of the two
[55:57] for God to do exceedingly abundantly
[55:59] that we can ask a thing
[56:02] I said there was someone in the Bible if
[56:05] you know the story there was a story of
[56:07] man named Moses who who grew up and was
[56:10] raised in Pharaoh's house but he was a
[56:12] he was an Israelite he was a Hebrew but
[56:15] God had placed a special gift on his
[56:17] life
[56:18] and he was he one day he thought he was
[56:22] going to be the second in command and to
[56:25] be a pharaoh one day but God didn't have
[56:27] that for his life and he said and I want
[56:30] to read something
[56:32] and
[56:34] and Moses he killed an Egyptian so he
[56:37] had to flee he had to flee Egypt at one
[56:39] point in time and then he got on the
[56:41] backside of the desert and said now we
[56:44] found out that Moses now when he was out
[56:46] there he 40 years he had trained himself
[56:49] knowing by by his mother that he was to
[56:52] deliver the children to Israel and he
[56:55] thought surely when he killed the
[56:56] Egyptian that the brothers would
[56:58] understand it but they didn't so through
[57:01] all of his scheme he failed and
[57:03] miserably failed but in five minutes in
[57:06] the presence of a burning bush out there
[57:08] God put more into him than the Seminary
[57:11] did down there in 40 years see Moses he
[57:15] had to come to that point and God said
[57:17] if not now then when he said he promised
[57:20] that he would deliver his children of
[57:22] Israel and he had the person but he had
[57:24] to wait until Moses was was ready he had
[57:27] to wait until Moses was prepared he had
[57:30] been through enough that he realized
[57:31] that it wasn't Moses strength anymore it
[57:33] was God
[57:34] it was God that was going to lead him
[57:36] through it it was God that was going to
[57:38] bring him through it it was God that he
[57:40] he started to examine himself in front
[57:42] of that that burning bush
[57:45] and he said Lord I'm not strong enough
[57:48] I my speech I can't talk Lord he
[57:52] examined himself but he realized he
[57:55] realized that if this was the time if
[57:58] not now then when and then
[58:01] later on he said and
[58:06] but when God appeared to him there in
[58:08] the burning bush the next day human
[58:10] support sapora sitting straddled a mule
[58:14] with the young and inner on a hip and a
[58:17] white beard hanging down to his waist
[58:19] his bald head shining and a stick in his
[58:21] hand going through through there glory
[58:24] to God his eyes looking over and she
[58:27] would ask him she said where are you
[58:28] going Moses we're going down to Egypt to
[58:31] take over a one-man invasion
[58:34] all it takes is one all it takes is one
[58:37] person to say Lord if not now then when
[58:40] Lord this is my time this is my
[58:43] opportunity I can be a one-man Invasion
[58:45] I can be a one-man Wrecking Crew I can
[58:48] just I can believe that God can use me
[58:51] to do exceedingly abundantly more than I
[58:53] ever thought or asked and believed that
[58:56] he could do but I know he can because
[58:58] Moses he decided that he had come to the
[59:01] point if not now then when even though I
[59:04] may be old even though I thought it was
[59:07] in my youth but now it's my turn to ask
[59:10] if not now then when and I can turn to
[59:12] them I can depend on them I can believe
[59:15] let God to see me through I can believe
[59:17] that no matter what he's going to bring
[59:20] me through but Moses had to examine
[59:23] himself
[59:24] he had to examine himself and look at
[59:26] him and say look and realize that he
[59:28] couldn't do anything
[59:30] he he realized that I can't do anything
[59:33] I can't bring myself to do anything I'm
[59:36] not strong enough I don't have a speech
[59:38] I'm not wise enough I can't do anything
[59:40] but Lord and the Lord said you don't
[59:43] have to I'm going to do it
[59:45] he said I'm going to do it I'm going to
[59:48] deliver them not you see when Moses was
[59:51] young he thought I was strong I can do
[59:53] it and they're going to Rally or when I
[59:55] kill this Egyptian they're going to
[59:56] Rally around me and we're going to take
[59:58] over but that's not how God had it
[1:00:01] that's not how God had had it in mind he
[1:00:04] he had to wait until until Moses got on
[1:00:06] the backside of the desert and he waited
[1:00:09] till he was maybe in one of his lowest
[1:00:12] moments to show him not now if not now
[1:00:14] then when this is the time that you can
[1:00:17] examine yourself and realize that it's
[1:00:19] not you that's going to do it he's going
[1:00:21] to do it for you he's going to bring you
[1:00:23] out he's going to cause he's going to
[1:00:25] catch you on your slide and he's going
[1:00:28] to bring you back up that hill and he's
[1:00:30] going to take you further he's going to
[1:00:32] allow you to climb higher he's going to
[1:00:34] allow you to go even deeper and further
[1:00:36] in the places that you never thought
[1:00:38] that you would be because he's doing it
[1:00:41] it's not you doing it it's him doing it
[1:00:43] it's him bringing you up it's him
[1:00:45] reaching down and saying I know that
[1:00:48] you're down low but I'm gonna pick you
[1:00:50] up I'm gonna Carry You Higher I'm gonna
[1:00:52] carry you further I'm gonna bring you
[1:00:54] into places that you never thought that
[1:00:56] you would be because it's not you doing
[1:00:58] it it's him doing it but you got to come
[1:01:01] to the point that if not now when when
[1:01:05] am I going to believe that God can do
[1:01:07] this
[1:01:08] when am I going to believe that he's
[1:01:10] going to do this in my life not in
[1:01:13] someone else's life you see God you may
[1:01:15] see God working in others but when is he
[1:01:17] going to do it for me but you got to
[1:01:19] examine yourself and said Lord am I
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:22] am I doing what I need to do to be ready
[1:01:25] for you to do this for me yeah have I
[1:01:27] come to the point have I repented of my
[1:01:29] sin have I done these things that you
[1:01:31] said in your word that you would do and
[1:01:34] to them not believe have I do I do I
[1:01:37] actually believe
[1:01:39] ask a question do you do I actually
[1:01:41] believe and have I acted on it
[1:01:43] have I come to the point that I've that
[1:01:46] Solomon said in Proverbs he said trust
[1:01:49] in the Lord with all that heart then
[1:01:51] lean not to an unknown understanding
[1:01:54] and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:01:56] Shall direct our thy path be not wise in
[1:01:59] our own eyes fear the lord and depart
[1:02:01] from Evil have I departed from evil
[1:02:04] have I turned from my Wicked Ways have I
[1:02:08] turned from the things that I was doing
[1:02:09] that wasn't pleasing in your sight have
[1:02:12] I made the positive decision that Lord I
[1:02:15] want to go all the way with you have I
[1:02:17] made the state Lord I want to come all
[1:02:19] the way completely and totally with you
[1:02:22] or am I trying to climb up the hill on
[1:02:24] my own
[1:02:25] am I trying to go up this hill by myself
[1:02:29] and not depend on his strength to keep
[1:02:31] me from falling because if I depend on
[1:02:34] mine I'm going to slip and fall I'm
[1:02:36] going to make missteps I'm going to step
[1:02:38] in the wrong place but if he carries me
[1:02:41] up he knows exactly where to go he knows
[1:02:44] how to bring me he knows how to take me
[1:02:46] he knows how to move this out of the way
[1:02:48] he can move that out of the way he can
[1:02:50] carry me further and higher than I ever
[1:02:53] thought that I would potentially go by
[1:02:55] myself
[1:02:57] and many of times we try to do it for
[1:02:59] ourselves but God said I'm waiting for
[1:03:01] you to stop so I can do it for you I'm
[1:03:05] waiting for you to stop so I can bring
[1:03:07] it for you so I can work it all out for
[1:03:09] your good I can do these things for your
[1:03:11] good but if not now then when when are
[1:03:14] you going to stop when are you going to
[1:03:17] say that enough is enough what are you
[1:03:19] going to say no
[1:03:21] when are you going to look at yourself
[1:03:24] and say no and say this is enough I'm
[1:03:27] not going any further this is enough God
[1:03:30] is going to handle this for me
[1:03:32] God is going to do this for me it's not
[1:03:35] my strength but it's his strength it's
[1:03:37] not my will but it's his will it's not
[1:03:40] what I want but what you want Lord in
[1:03:43] every aspect of my life in every part of
[1:03:45] my life so if not now then when when are
[1:03:48] you going to make that decision
[1:03:50] each of us have to make that this each
[1:03:52] of us get the opportunity to make that
[1:03:55] decision each and every day that you are
[1:03:57] alive you get the opportunity to make
[1:04:00] the right decision you get the
[1:04:02] opportunity to say Lord I want you to
[1:04:04] work in my life Lord I Want You To Be My
[1:04:08] All In All I Want You To Be My Savior I
[1:04:10] want you to be my friend Lord I want you
[1:04:12] to be the My Savior and my God the one
[1:04:15] that I depend on each and every day
[1:04:18] but sometimes we think that we got so
[1:04:21] much longer we got so much longer to
[1:04:23] live but I ask you to examine yourself
[1:04:25] and ask yourself the question if not now
[1:04:28] then when
[1:04:30] when will I turn and do what you want me
[1:04:33] to do Lord when will I decide that
[1:04:35] enough is enough when will I decide to
[1:04:38] say no
[1:04:40] because each of us had that opportunity
[1:04:42] to say it to each of us had that
[1:04:44] opportunity that God places in our lives
[1:04:47] for you to come forward and say Lord
[1:04:50] today is my day today is my day to turn
[1:04:53] to you today is my day to give you
[1:04:56] everything today is my day to say Lord
[1:04:58] you deserve it all Lord you deserve it
[1:05:01] all of the glory you deserve it
[1:05:03] everything Lord you deserve my life Lord
[1:05:06] I'm nothing without you giving me the
[1:05:08] breath to breathe every single morning
[1:05:10] I'm nothing without you making my lungs
[1:05:13] expand making my heart beat I'm nothing
[1:05:15] if you don't give me that Lord Jesus so
[1:05:18] Lord I want to give you everything that
[1:05:20] you've given to me because I know you
[1:05:22] will do exceedingly and abundantly more
[1:05:24] than I can ever ask anything so Lord I
[1:05:27] want to examine myself and each and
[1:05:29] every one of us have to do that each and
[1:05:30] every day Lord examine ourselves like
[1:05:33] David said Lord create in me a clean
[1:05:34] heart and renewal rights Spirit In Me
[1:05:39] because David came to the poor place and
[1:05:41] he said Lord I know that I've sinned
[1:05:43] I've done some things that wasn't right
[1:05:45] in your eyes but Lord if if I'm not
[1:05:48] going to wait till tomorrow to turn to
[1:05:50] you I'm not going to wait till the next
[1:05:52] day Lord I want you to do it now I want
[1:05:55] you to do it today Lord amen and I know
[1:05:57] it won't be easier tomorrow but I know
[1:05:59] that you'll be here with me I know that
[1:06:01] you're going to be here with me so I can
[1:06:03] ask myself if not when if not now then
[1:06:06] when and my win is right now my chance
[1:06:10] to change is right now my opportunity to
[1:06:13] say Lord I want you is right now and

[1:06:18] be the head of my life is right now I
[1:06:20] don't have to wait till tomorrow I don't

[1:06:24] to wait till things come in life
[1:06:27] until opportunities come to to moments
[1:06:30] come

[1:06:41] to come into my life Lord I want you to
[1:06:43] to rest inside of me as I examine myself
[1:06:48] I said maybe maybe we may not be where
[1:06:50] we want to be but we thank God we're not
[1:06:53] where we used to be but see there's more
[1:06:55] opportunities for us to grow
[1:06:57] each and every day there's more
[1:06:59] opportunities for us to grow there's
[1:07:01] more opportunity for us to realize that
