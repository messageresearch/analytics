name amen God bless you Isaiah 28 and 14 Isaiah 28 and4 ain't God good amen so many blessings undeserved amen amen L Isaiah 284 it says wherefore heal the word of the Lord ye scon for men that rule this people which is in Jerusalem because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing Scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under the falsehood have we hid ourselves therefore th said the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste may God bless the in this word you may be seated he said therefore thus said the Lord Behold our l z for Foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation amen yes now the Bible says in songs if the foundation be destroyed it says what can the righteous do your foundation if you ever were building a house or some type of building it's very important that the foundation be laid properly amen because you can build the whole house when it's off of foundation it's going to come up crooked and when the storms are come I remember uh the foundation was off and somebody tried to put the roof on the building see The Headstone can't come to the body they try to put a roof on and when they tried to put the roof on because the foundation off the walls start buckling so the building was in danger of falling you can't put the headstone on a building that the foundation is off because it's going to cause when The Headstone go to set on it's going to crush it amen are you with me amen so uh often times people call themselves contractors and Builders and yet they're not skillful that's right a sure Foundation bless Jesus one thing you want to be correct is your foundation amen when they were building this church building they bought in a hundred and something load truckloads of dirt and they had to each time they bring it in they had to roll it and pack it and that was a over aund truck loads before they can put the builds and slab down and the inspector had to come and inspect whether or not you lay you laid a good foundation whether it's packed right that's right because before you pull that cement it's got to be right then they had to dig around before you pour and make sure everything that's going to the pillars are going to set they got to make sure all of this Foundation is strong enough and is done according to the blueprint that's right we need a blueprint to go by and uh and you got to draw up a plan for uh the building in which you were going to construct are you with me amen so it was very important that these this foundation work was doing properly amen because if it wasn't time going to tell amen yes sir when you go up there to put that roof on everything going to be out of joint and I believe that here it says let's look at uh he says 16th verse again there therefore thus said the Lord behold I land Z for a foundation a stone now he says a what a tried Stone not just a stone but if this stone is tried that's it's been tested amen so you got to be careful you got to make sure the stone has been tested am so he said a tri Stone a precious Coral Stone amen you got to make sure your Corners are right cuz if your Corners ain't right you in trouble amen a precious Cornerstone we got to have a a stone to start everything if you building by Stones you got to have a starting place a precious Cornerstone a what a sure this thing got to be sure you can't take no Chances with it amen you putting up a structure it might cost you uh uh $500,000 or million dollar structure when you put up that structure you don't want no travel at the river amen [Applause] amen all of the money you invested in it it won't do you no good why the foundation is off amen yes so people look at it say man what why did they expect catch that you've seen Builders crumble all over the world in America because somebody pay the inspector little extra dollars under the table Amen to pass it bridges falling down and everything because somebody done pay some under cover money amen the the the pass it one of the brothers said he was inspecting pipes and he said said he he had to make sure everything that's in that pipe is right and inspect it properly but the inspector come by and somebody passes some money and they make sure and they don't care so when the storms come and the the roads start the pipes start busting in the roads are all bust up and all and you wonder why people amen tried to get around the foundation work thank you because you might pay more almost in the foundation than you pay in the whole business I said before we can get this structure started we probably had already paid over $100,000 just getting the foundation work started and you said well you you don't see no building no see nothing but the foundation work going to cost you over $100,000 and we wern't expecting that cuz all we had was so many hundreds a couple hundred, so how we going to get the building up when we put most of our money in the foundation first of all you got to get blueprints for this and blueprints for that and blueprints for that by the time you get AR Tech plan you don't pay $30,000 you know that's just the plans you ain't done nothing yet and by the time you get them the oh Lord you might we might pay about 15 150,000 before you get started okay but it's very important are y'all with me it's very important amen so we try to you know get around it you can't get around it because if the expect to come he going to I'm not going to P this amen when you when you talk about going to heaven you don't want no trouble amen amen amen we got a plan here we got to go by that's the Bible That's the word of God amen amen you got to be sure amen that you going according to the pattern amen amen amen amen what laid in the scripture you got to check it out amen and I'm going tell you the Bible said make your calling an election what sure sure amen you going to have to be sure don't think you saved don't uh just I am see uh-uh oh yes I believe the message I believe God turn to all that's good but you got to make your calling in election sure amen amen amen why do you stand with God Amen sure Foundation amen oh yes oh well oh yes God to the prophet I believe this mess oh yes I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'm a Christian yes God sa me m the Jews said oh yes we Jews yes we got chosen people oh hallelujah praise God uhuh thank you I'm briide I'm just bless Jesus we're happy we're excited thank the Lord oh yes something to be excited about yes Foundation tried Stone a a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not be not make what not make haste now look what he says here for judgment also will I lay to the what line and righteousness to the what plet plummet and the hail shall what sweep away the Refuge okay and hail shall sweep away come on sometime we think we special we're in part we're somebody because we think that we got it all made oh yes I'm special oh I'm sister a Savor come on it says and the water shall overflow thy what Hiding Place thy hiding place and your Covenant with Death Shall be diseno and your agreement with hell shall be what shall not stand when the overflowing scurs shall pass through then ye shall be what Trot down by okay from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you your morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to the UN what understand the report so look what he says here for the bed is what shorter than the man stretch himself on the bed is shorter than the man that stretch himself on it okay himself on it and the cover is narrower than what in come on something wrong okay it said the Lord shall AR raise up at rise up in mountain in the mountain per he shall be wrought as in the valley of Gideon and that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his acts his strange a amen I want to say this this morning that that he said they have made lies their Refuge see what I'm saying see y'all you got to understand that you can't hide from God yes you can't hide your sins like Adam did and cover them like Adam did and think you going to get away but they was you know there security rest in that they uh had they were God chosen people amen they was found asleep in calmer security are you with me amen people were sleep asleep in a false security amen and some people are falsely secured amen so when the storm of light begin to rage you're going to find out that your foundation that you have built your faith on that's is going to crumble amen your house won't stand why because you built it on Sand amen and because you're built it on Sand and not the Rock amen are you with me am one of the most quoted songs during covid time was pongs 91 let's look at that for a minute Psalms 91 people really they really trusting in the word and and they were they were quoting us everywhere you went a person had had a little memory bank you heard this everywhere a person that thought themselves to be a Christian could quote it in the schoolhouse Rachel come and ask me you know what what about the song Everybody's quoting you know cuz everybody was quoting ssongs 91 everywhere I turn and look at the news if you look at any kind of religious people they was quoting amen but he says he that dwell in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the what the Aly see it's where you dwelling see but here Israel thought that the uh we don't have to worry about the syrians coming we don't have to worry about the enemy so many people are in church and they ain't worried about the devil they're not worried about bad things happening they're not worried about trouble times they're not worried about their life because everything seems to they got security they got in their mind I got it together amen people are have gotten it together with inside of themselves and they think that all is well amen you know sometimes uh the prophets of that day could give the people of false security tell the people everything going to be all right hey you're on your way to heaven don't worry about the Syria don't worry about the storm if I tell you don't worry about the Great Tribulation don't worry about the nuclear uh bombs don't worry about World War II don't worry about amen the stock market might crash don't worry about amen the food supply might run up don't worry about the hurricane coming don't worry about no see if your foundation is not right when the Storm come the overflowing Scourge going to come isn't that right amen but they're telling you amen you all right you you're in Jerusalem you're a Jew and don't worry about it we can we can politicize it away and our politics is right and and and and God he said you spat it in his s are you with me I believe that as many Christian no matter how secured they thought they were no matter how blessed they thought of themselves many of them had a false security because it was quoted he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high amen shall abide under the shadows of the alight Mighty Hallelujah they thought that oh we got a secret place I'm a Christian your secret place might be your church your preacher amen your your confession of Christianity or or whatever you know you might think of yourself as being secure but are we really check your foundation are you really secure amen amen it says here in uh Psalms 91 I will say of the Lord he is my what ref but here and Isaiah said they made lies their Refuge are you with me amen they made lies their Refuge amen I I don't want you to make lies your
