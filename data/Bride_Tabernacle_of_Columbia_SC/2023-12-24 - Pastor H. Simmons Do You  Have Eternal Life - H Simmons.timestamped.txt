[46:05] amen we were just speaking at brother
[46:08] funeral the other day and we was talking
[46:10] about eternal
[46:12] life so we want to continue on on that
[46:16] but like to say you know the world
[46:19] around is celebrating the birth of Jesus
[46:22] Christ we understand that Jesus
[46:26] you know wasn't born in the winter like
[46:29] it is now cuz the Shepherds wouldn't be
[46:31] in the field but we understand that
[46:34] Pagan Rome came in and and the through
[46:39] through the Roman Catholic Church they
[46:41] bought in Pagan Rome teaching which was
[46:45] the ladi's day which was the son God
[46:48] birthday not the Son of God but the son
[46:52] God Amen but a lot of traditions have
[46:55] have been handed down for years and
[46:58] years and people just traditionally do
[47:01] things because it's
[47:02] tradition and some people don't
[47:05] understand and some children may think
[47:08] oh this is Jesus birthday it's not Jesus
[47:11] birthday it's just tradition that they
[47:14] say are you with me so a lot of
[47:17] traditions like Thanksgiving and you
[47:19] know Mother's Day and Father's Day and
[47:23] sister brother day a lot of things
[47:25] people keep and we don't say nothing
[47:27] about but we want you to have
[47:30] understanding amen and we thank God that
[47:34] Jesus was born if the world want to
[47:36] recognize it then thank the
[47:38] Lord amen that Jesus was born and the
[47:42] purpose of him being born was not for us
[47:46] amen the you know so much as if people
[47:49] want to do good things and give to one
[47:51] another thank God do that every day but
[47:56] if you want to do it on a special day
[47:58] doing good wein got no problem with that
[48:02] but understand that you know what truth
[48:06] is amen you should know the truth and

[48:34] day you know the Bible said the wise men
[48:38] they came to worship
[48:40] Jesus amen when they saw him they
[48:42] worship him they didn't worship the star
[48:45] but they worship
[48:46] him we know that when the wise man got
[48:49] there was two he was about two years old
[48:51] when the wise men that followed the star
[48:54] when they got there he was about 2 years
[48:56] old but when the Shepherds that were in
[48:58] the field when they Angels met them and
[49:01] told them they SP them in the mansion
[49:03] that's why it had to be Shepherds right
[49:06] so the Shepherds and the wise men is two
[49:08] different occasions are you with me so
[49:11] when you see this uh wise men coming
[49:13] with the gift and the baby no he was two
[49:15] years old then you know what I'm saying
[49:18] but the
[49:19] Shepherds they
[49:21] came and he was in the Mangia right so
[49:24] God bless you
[49:27] amen we said those things because
[49:29] somebody else will tell you and you say
[49:32] well I didn't know that yeah you knew it
[49:34] so we we let you know amen cuz I I I
[49:37] guarantee you jov witness knocking on
[49:39] everybody door telling them what I'm
[49:41] what I'm telling y'all and they use that
[49:44] time to convert a lot of people cuz
[49:46] people go to church and they said well
[49:48] I've been Tau uh no you know the truth
[49:52] amen and a lot of people are become
[49:56] Jehovah Witness a seven day Venice at
[49:58] that time because nobody told them right
[50:02] but when you have been taught the truth
[50:04] you know about these
[50:06] things
[50:08] okay I don't know how to start but I'll
[50:11] start he said here it
[50:15] says good Master you know eternal life
[50:19] do you have it eternal life that's the
[50:22] question I like to ask and I want you to
[50:25] think about it do you have eternal
[50:29] life the next question is you know
[50:33] sometimes we we want to
[50:34] know what is eternal
[50:37] life what is eternal life do I have it
[50:40] you
[50:42] know most of the time we think about
[50:45] life
[50:47] insurance and everybody you know
[50:49] sometimes we have people die and they
[50:51] don't have no insurance and we all
[50:53] strapped together and try to uh pay for
[50:55] for their funeral and burier you know
[50:58] because they don't have life
[51:00] insurance that kind of life
[51:03] insurance you have life insurance then
[51:05] you get a
[51:07] beneficiary are you with me now the the
[51:11] life
[51:12] insurance uh the people pay for that
[51:15] life insurance sometime for 20 30 40 50
[51:20] years you know and a lot of times that's
[51:23] how people become millionaires they get
[51:25] it when they young and they don't pay
[51:28] much for
[51:29] it and if they happen to
[51:32] die they want to leave you know 10
[51:35] million or five million they want to die
[51:37] quick so they want their family to be
[51:41] millionaires and the family hoping they
[51:43] hir up and
[51:44] die if he got $10 million wor you know
[51:48] the children won't their parents to die
[51:50] die quick you got $10 million pocy so
[51:54] you better not tell them
[51:57] but if you got a million dollar policy
[51:59] let's just think within realistical
[52:01] terms you got a million dollar policy
[52:05] and you pay for that policy because you
[52:08] want to leave your family in inheritance
[52:10] not me now you know I got to be guilty I
[52:14] didn't leave
[52:16] that okay but if you
[52:19] wise you know you can do that and your
[52:23] children can become instant me iones
[52:25] well if you if you're young now get old
[52:28] like me you can't afford the policy
[52:30] almost and nobody want to sell you one
[52:33] cuz they ain't expecting you to live
[52:35] long enough for them to benefit from you
[52:38] having a million dollar policy are you
[52:41] with me so I'm saying uh eternal
[52:45] life you know the young man had a good
[52:48] question good
[52:50] Master what I got to do I want
[52:53] it he must have eternal life because it
[52:57] was something that he
[52:59] wanted are you with me he must have
[53:02] considered eternal life because amen it
[53:06] was something that he asked I what what
[53:09] can I
[53:10] do you know what I want to know what can
[53:13] I do but to uh most of us eternal life
[53:17] is not
[53:19] valuable it has no value to it so
[53:23] eternal life that has no value to it
[53:26] then uh why you want it so most people
[53:30] don't want it because it it is of no
[53:33] value only when uh when they on their
[53:38] death bed that they realize I don't want
[53:40] to
[53:41] die it doesn't matter sometimes how sick
[53:44] an individual is it's something about
[53:47] dying that they don't want to
[53:50] do it's only those
[53:53] that have a e eternal life that don't
[53:57] mind
[53:59] dying they if I got to die then let me
[54:02] die even the knowing that it's something
[54:05] about life that you don't I mean you
[54:08] value you want to live a little little
[54:10] while
[54:12] longer so if the doctor say you have
[54:15] this kind of sickness or this kind of
[54:16] disease you got to take this kind of
[54:19] medicine maybe you got to go on dialysis
[54:22] maybe you got to uh take a a blood then
[54:25] maybe you got to do this or that then
[54:27] you say well doctor I want to
[54:30] live so whatever I got to take my high
[54:33] blood pressure medicine I got to do this
[54:35] I got to go to dialysis I want to live a
[54:37] couple days longer Lord what whatever I
[54:40] got to do doc I'll do
[54:42] it but this man was concerned this young
[54:46] man uh this young man was concerned
[54:48] about more than just uh living a few
[54:52] days longer he wanted eternal life amen
[54:56] then he said what good
[54:58] thing you know I I know I got I got to
[55:01] do some good thing you know he said what
[55:04] good thing can I do that that I can have
[55:08] it and a lot of people are doing good

[1:08:16] willing to come to Jesus and ask for
[1:08:19] something that he thought was more
