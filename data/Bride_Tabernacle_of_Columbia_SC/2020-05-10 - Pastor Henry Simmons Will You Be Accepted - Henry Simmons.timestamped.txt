[33:27] just want to be accepted this morning I
[33:31] want to hear him say well done good and
[33:35] faithful servant will you be accepted
[33:41] this morning
[33:47] four and three in process of time came
[33:54] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[33:57] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[34:01] and evil he also bored of the first none
[34:07] of the flop is flawed and of the fact
[34:13] they are and the Lord had respect to
[34:16] Abel and his offering but in to Cain and
[34:22] to his offering he had not respect and
[34:27] Cain was very wroth and his countenance
[34:31] fell and the Lord said unto Cain why are
[34:37] they wrought and why is that countenance
[34:41] fallen if God do well thou shalt thou
[34:47] not be accepted and if God doeth not
[34:53] well sin lies at the door and unto thee
[34:59] shall be his desire and thou shall rule
[35:06] over him so by the grace of God and we
[35:10] thank the art for the word you may be
[35:12] seated
[35:13] god is good amen will you be accepted
[35:19] because as I said earlier we want to
[35:26] hear him say well done good and faithful
[35:29] servant enter into this joy of the Lord
[35:33] when it's all over when the work Don has
[35:36] done a man that I heard somebody say to
[35:41] me the work I've done speak for me may
[35:44] the life I live
[35:45] speak for me when it's all over your
[35:53] offering what you've given to God
[35:57] I want to know will God accept what
[36:03] you're giving it because many of times
[36:06] we give God what we think he deserve or
[36:13] what we think we want to give him and I
[36:19] sometimes like I find myself for that
[36:23] I'm not giving God enough that I can
[36:27] really do more than I'm doing for the
[36:30] Lord
[36:33] he's too good to me and he's been too
[36:38] good to me for me to be slack about the
[36:46] things of the Lord sometimes I look at
[36:51] myself and I says certainly I am feeling
[36:55] in the respect that I can give God more
[37:01] than I'm giving I can do more than I'm
[37:06] doing I can pray more than I'm praying I
[37:10] can fire more than I'm fasting in every
[37:16] every area and aspect of my walk with
[37:19] God you know I said to brother Gordon if
[37:28] I complete a good time lucky please and
[37:31] saying like Sean wins and play the socks
[37:36] are like Josh and stuff like I said
[37:40] y'all probably be in church all day and
[37:42] night because I wouldn't stop I mean I
[37:46] probably on the street corner then you
[37:49] know I mean because I know people like
[37:56] somebody that can sing and somebody can
[37:59] play now preaching they may listen a
[38:02] little while but if he is saying do you
[38:07] play an instrument
[38:09] you got a crowd right there somebody
[38:13] bricks god I said I wish I had it could
[38:15] all you would y'all y'all meet in a lot
[38:20] of trouble y'all think only in church
[38:24] for a little while but y'all be in
[38:25] church all day obviously I get caught up
[38:29] but by the grace of God nevertheless we
[38:35] must examine ourselves are we given God
[38:38] all that he deserves for his blessings
[38:43] towards our lives are we given God see
[38:46] Abel had a revelation of what God wanted
[38:51] do you have a revelation of what God is
[38:55] required of you in your spiritual walk
[38:58] do you have a revelation of what God
[39:00] wants in your life and how what he wants
[39:04] you to give back to him because it took
[39:08] a revelation for able to know what God
[39:11] was required of him and it takes a
[39:15] revelation for you and I to really come
[39:18] in contact with God and said God
[39:20] revealed to me the first thing song or
[39:24] Paul wonder we saw on the way to the
[39:27] Masters and when he saw the light and he
[39:30] recognized who are your Lord and lost
[39:33] and I'm Jesus the first thing he said
[39:35] long what would I have me to do I
[39:38] believe God just didn't save us to sit
[39:41] down but God has something that he wants
[39:45] you to do and when I came to Christ as
[39:50] an early Tahoe fellow he met 40 some
[39:55] hard years ago and and I wanted to give
[40:00] him everything on God but I find myself
[40:03] not knowing what my purpose was what can
[40:06] I do for God I can't sing
[40:09] I'm scared to talking for the people
[40:14] what can I do I looked at myself I
[40:17] couldn't do nothing one thing I find
[40:21] myself I found myself in prayer every
[40:22] prior service that I could get in
[40:25] I found myself constantly and praying on
[40:28] my knees and crying not to God because I
[40:31] wanted didn't know what I could do for
[40:33] the Lord and everybody that I could tell
[40:35] about the goodness of the Lord
[40:37] I find myself witnessing for him on the
[40:39] job as a worked in the hospital
[40:42] television and could bring people to
[40:44] church and and let them experience what
[40:47] I've experienced that God has saved me I
[40:51] wanted other people to be saved and then
[40:55] in the purpose of God's gift in your
[40:58] life is just enhancing that you can use
[41:01] that gift to bring one soul to Jesus
[41:03] Christ then you must do everything with
[41:07] what God has given you to win a soul to
[41:10] Christ and your main objective as a
[41:13] Christian is not to live for yourself
[41:16] but to live for others and they do all
[41:19] you can to try to get somebody to Jesus
[41:22] it doesn't matter how you look doing it
[41:26] it's about your motive and your
[41:29] objective and what you're trying to
[41:32] achieve let's use the gift that God has
[41:36] restored upon our lives to win souls to
[41:41] Jesus Christ and not let's not look at
[41:46] ourselves as victims of circumstances in
[41:51] and look at all the things that have
[41:53] before us even that's what's getting in
[41:57] problems he said if God be with us there
[42:00] will be all these miracles
[42:02] amen I want to know it that our fathers
[42:06] told us about I want to know where is it
[42:09] he meant if God is false and then he
[42:13] beheld the Midianites and every time he
[42:16] tried to they planted and they had a
[42:20] harness and the enemy
[42:22] I mean take it away from them and just
[42:24] seemed like every time God bless you the
[42:26] devil come and take it away from you
[42:29] are you up so here guy if God be forced
[42:35] and why is all as miracles even and you
[42:39] look at the stuff this virus and if God
[42:43] before us
[42:44] then where is his miracles hills that no
[42:48] balm in Gilead is that no physician here
[42:51] even if the Lord is on our side did we
[42:56] hire about a God of healing and
[43:00] deliverance but why is it illiterate in
[43:03] my life they men don't count yourself
[43:07] short
[43:08] they men only your revelation would
[43:11] determine your sacrifice your revelation
[43:16] is reflection amen
[43:18] of what you would give to God amen and
[43:22] if you have a real revelation that
[43:25] healing of the blood of cheeks

[43:37] many people are so sad and and their
[43:40] part of the way with amen

[50:54] revelation
[50:55] God has put you in heavenly places but
[50:58] that must be a revelation to you they
[51:00] meant Cain don't have that revelation
[51:02] but Ava had a revelation what God had
[51:06] required and your position of who you
[51:09] are he meant cause this Amen God ain't
[51:12] meant to have respect to you are you
[51:15] with me God has done something look what
[51:18] he says here he said according as he has
[51:22] what it shows us accordingly he's chosen
[51:26] us in him when that means he meant that
[51:32] you were in it as you were in your
[51:36] great-great-grandfather amen as I was
[51:39] where back in my great-granddaddy before
[51:42] I even knew I was there I mean I was
[51:45] there and I was passed on to my my
[51:49] grandfather did my daddy amen and I got
[51:52] here amen

[52:09] position had placed me in the middle
[52:11] seven older seven younger seven brother
[52:18] seven sisters are you with me
[52:21] but God knew I would be number eight
[52:24] before the word and God saw me in my
[52:29] great-grandfather just like he even had
[52:32] pain tired while he was yet I leave on a
[52:37] map a time when he why he was yet in the
[52:40] lungs of his father Abraham leave all
[52:42] the way back and Eva Hannah loves and
[52:47] didn't even come into existence yet but
[52:49] God said he paid ties why he was yet in
[52:52] the lungs
[52:57] chosen us in him when before when the
[53:03] foundation of the world
[53:06] became an existence God chose us even
[53:12] but you must have a revelation that God
[53:14] chose you if you don't know that then
[53:19] you might be like King amen
[53:23] will I be accepted will your sacrifice
[53:26] be accepted will you be accepted in man
[53:29] but here he says that's calling as he's
[53:34] chosen us in him before the foundation
[53:37] of the world that we should be holy and
[53:40] without blame before him how amen if you
[53:45] don't have a love you you're not in hell
[53:48] because God is a law if you got to be
[53:52] mean and hateful in despiteful and
[53:56] jealous and envy and strife he meant but
[54:00] God chose you they meant in him that you
[54:04] should be holy he meant God wants you to
[54:07] be separate from the unholy things they
[54:13] meant separate from and then all the
[54:16] alcohol drinking and all the reef was
[54:21] smoking in the joints in the marijuana
[54:24] God wants you to be holy for your body
[54:28] is a temple of the one Holy Ghost you've
[54:31] got to realize that God didn't call you
[54:33] to uncleanliness
[54:35] but God called you to holiness they
[54:38] meant thank God for holiness amen he
[54:42] chose you in him before the foundation
[54:44] of the world
[54:45] you should be holy and without blame
[54:48] before him in love haven't read
[54:50] estimated us unto the adoption of
[54:53] children by Jesus Christ he meant to
[54:57] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:00] of what his will they meant how do you
[55:05] know what God will is for your life
[55:08] brother and sister God will is his word
[55:10] and we can try to do God a service
[55:15] is not according to his will sometimes
[55:17] but you know what the will of God is for
[55:20] your life it's the word he said if you
[55:23] abide in me and my words abide in you
[55:25] amen
[55:27] you can ask what you will and I do it
[55:29] are you with me now Cain got upset with
[55:34] God because he didn't want to he meant
[55:36] do whatever did never had a revelation
[55:40] of doing what the word will do required
[55:44] oh you and you and I have this Bible
[55:48] here and we know what the word is
[55:49] required well you know some people say
[55:51] well I know what God said
[55:53] but God better take this you know it
[55:58] just is it seem like people think that
[56:01] they can get by on doing it their own
[56:04] way he says here to the praise of the
[56:10] glory of His grace when he has made us
[56:14] accepted all you with me you can't just
[56:17] see how you know you accepted he said he
[56:21] has made us what are you ask the
[56:27] question will you be accepted the Bible
[56:30] said he's made us what in the beloved
[56:35] amen now I want you to understand that
[56:38] God has made you accepted in the beloved
[56:42] amen it's not what you've done but but
[56:46] what he's done for us
[56:49] Levi didn't physically pay ties Abraham
[56:52] physically paid to tithe but Levi
[56:55] appeals are you amen and and God amen
[57:01] it's not what you gave God that God
[57:05] accepted you it's what God gave you in
[57:10] it is whatever ham did that Levi was a
[57:14] beneficiary of what Abraham did and we
[57:20] are benefiting let me show you okay in
[57:25] the seventh verse it says and hole we
[57:27] have reduction
[57:29] see Abel offered up the blood he meant
[57:35] of an animal amen and he was accepted
[57:40] but he said here that at home we have
[57:43] redemption through his blood the
[57:47] forgiveness of sins according to the
[57:51] riches of his word it's great they meant
[57:56] grace is God's unmerited favor love
[57:59] towards us in the right
[58:01] that means we didn't deserve it but God
[58:04] gave it to us we we are accepted because
[58:06] of the grace of God are you a man and I
[58:12] said when he has me he has way and he
[58:17] has a bound towards us in all wisdom and
[58:21] what prunes it had been made known unto
[58:26] us to what God will is a mystery the
[58:32] world don't know nothing about it the
[58:36] world knows nothing about it but God has
[58:39] made known to you and I the mystery of
[58:42] his will and I said will you be accepted
[58:48] the mystery of your sentence and the
[58:53] reason God has accepted you because God
[58:57] accepted Abel's sacrifice
[59:01] are you a Cain was denied because of
[59:06] what he offered God it's a lot of people
[59:10] that are working out here for the Lord

[59:15] the Lord and one day they're gonna come
