[39:20] hallelujah
[39:23] praise the lord
[39:25] i'm not much of a singer but that kind
[39:28] of lights my fire a little bit
[39:31] man to think that the resurrection
[39:35] is living inside of me
[39:37] hallelujah let me get rid of this one
[39:39] now
[39:47] becomes a pacifier when i'm singing so
[39:51] praise the lord
[39:54] they ask i believe brother steve shelley
[39:56] one time why he liked to carry the
[39:57] pacifier past
[39:59] the microphone on time he said because
[40:01] it has become a pacifier to me
[40:04] amen
[40:05] praise the lord if you will turn in your
[40:07] bible to isaiah
[40:15] now i'm going to tell you this this
[40:16] bottle of water
[40:18] you
[40:19] somebody better get it back up
[40:24] because they it might be
[40:26] sweating with the oldies this morning
[40:29] praise the lord
[40:30] because when you start preaching you
[40:32] can't help but get excited
[40:35] is that right
[40:36] when the word of god when you know that
[40:39] you know that you know and the word of
[40:41] god starts coming forth
[40:43] you know i was standing this morning and
[40:45] and i was combing my hair and the barber
[40:48] that that i used to use he got coveted
[40:51] and he once he recovered he he went back
[40:54] to honduras
[40:56] and uh his new guy cut my hair and boy i
[40:58] mean i mean he just about scalped me and
[41:01] i'm saying god it wouldn't lay down
[41:03] nothing it was like porcupines you know
[41:06] praise the lord and and so i'm sitting
[41:08] there i'm saying i look in the mirror
[41:10] and i said these kids are going to think
[41:12] that i look like alfalfa
[41:15] and then i i thought wait a minute these
[41:18] kids probably don't know what alfalfa is
[41:22] and then i realized my god
[41:25] you know when i was 18 years old i had
[41:27] things i could identify with every every
[41:30] young person under this tent with
[41:32] because i was still young
[41:35] then i turned about 28 and i had
[41:38] children of my own and so i was still
[41:40] being able to identify with you through
[41:42] my children i knew
[41:44] some of the needs that you have
[41:48] but then my kids grew up
[41:52] and we've left with one standard that we
[41:55] can have fellowship with this morning
[41:57] and that's the only way that you can
[41:59] identify with me and i can identify with
[42:02] you and we have the same god
[42:05] jesus christ is that right
[42:08] and if you're not identifying with jesus
[42:10] you certainly won't be able to identify
[42:13] with me this morning
[42:14] amen praise the lord if you will turn in
[42:17] your bibles to isaiah the first chapter
[42:20] i got a question to ask everyone here
[42:24] did
[42:25] you get
[42:26] what you expected
[42:29] did you get what you expected
[42:32] praise the lord we we've heard
[42:34] that it's we get what we expect
[42:39] you know
[42:40] but i found that statement to be
[42:42] sometimes true and sometimes not
[42:45] because
[42:46] hey i i've i i've went into restaurants
[42:50] and ordered a
[42:51] a steak and was expecting one about that
[42:54] size and got one this size instead
[42:58] so i didn't get what i expected did i
[43:02] but let me tell you
[43:04] if you fully expect
[43:07] god will never go back on his word
[43:10] praise the lord isaiah 1 18.
[43:18] everybody got it say amen
[43:21] come
[43:23] some of the most familiar scriptures in
[43:25] the word of god come now and let us
[43:27] reason together sayeth the lord
[43:29] though your sins be as scarlet
[43:32] they shall be white as snow
[43:34] though they may be red like crimson
[43:37] they shall be as wool if you be willing
[43:41] and obedient you shall eat the good of
[43:44] the land
[43:45] but if you refuse and rebel
[43:49] you shall be devoured with the sword
[43:52] for the mouth of the lord have spoken it
[43:57] father god we've read a portion of your
[44:00] word
[44:01] education affords that to us that we can
[44:04] we can set and open the pages of your
[44:07] word and read it lord
[44:09] but dear god it takes more than
[44:11] education to open it to us lord and lord
[44:15] that's where we stand in this last day
[44:17] god we need an opening lord
[44:21] father god our eyes need to be healed of
[44:24] the blindness lord jesus and we can see
[44:27] it to your word deeper than we've ever
[44:29] seen god come dear god in the name of
[44:32] jesus lord
[44:34] god i believe with all of my heart that
[44:36] you sent me here lord and i believe with
[44:39] all of my heart god that there's
[44:41] somebody that needs your word this
[44:43] morning now god you come and do your own
[44:46] preaching lord lord let me hide behind
[44:49] the shekinah glory of god and let them
[44:52] see you lord in jesus name we thank you
[44:55] dear god amen praise the lord
[44:59] amen you can be seated you know very few
[45:02] times in life will you ever be invited
[45:05] to a court for something good
[45:10] you know in the state of virginia how
[45:12] many how many 16 year olds we got any 16
[45:14] year olds we got
[45:16] praise the lord anybody that's 15 years
[45:18] old
[45:19] 15 years old 14 years old hi we got some
[45:22] 14s
[45:25] there's a big event in this man's life
[45:27] right here this young man's life is
[45:29] coming
[45:30] in the state of virginia if he lived in
[45:32] the state of virginia because that when
[45:33] he turns 15 and eight months he can go
[45:36] and apply for a learner's permit
[45:40] and he can go behind the and get inside
[45:43] the the car with as long as he has a
[45:46] licensed driver over 18 years old in the
[45:49] car with him and he can drive
[45:53] and then when he turns 16 he can take
[45:55] the actual test
[45:57] and receive his his driving permit
[46:02] but he doesn't receive it
[46:05] right away
[46:06] in the state of virginia there's one
[46:09] time that you can come to the judge free
[46:11] of charge
[46:16] and let me tell you i've seen them do it
[46:18] different ways
[46:21] in the state of virginia but a judge
[46:24] will present to you
[46:26] your
[46:27] driver's license in the state of
[46:28] virginia when you turn 16 years old
[46:32] you know and so every every 16 year old
[46:35] that has their driver's license state of
[46:37] virginia has stood before the judge
[46:40] one time or the other you say brother
[46:42] that's not a big event oh yeah when you
[46:44] turn 16 years old you know you'll know
[46:47] about it some of us remember that 16
[46:50] years old
[46:51] now one judge played the trick
[46:54] to him
[46:55] and he laid all the driver's license on
[46:57] a big table in front of him
[46:59] and he called instead of calling the
[47:01] child he called the parent
[47:04] to come and get the driver's license
[47:06] and he said i want to give you i'm
[47:08] investing in each one of you parents the
[47:11] right to pull these driver's license at
[47:14] any time you deem necessary
[47:18] that was rough
[47:20] you know but it was it was okay
[47:23] you know but i can imagine if i was 16
[47:26] years old i'm sitting there saying oh no
[47:32] i thought they were mine
[47:36] so see
[47:37] no good thing comes normally when you're
[47:40] called before the court
[47:42] but when you look into the original
[47:44] greek on that scripture come now let us
[47:46] reason together it means come to the
[47:50] judgment seat and let us reason
[47:54] together
[47:57] praise the lord he's inviting you to a
[48:00] place to where you can approach his
[48:02] judgment seat in neutral
[48:07] see
[48:08] he doesn't find you guilty
[48:13] he doesn't find you
[48:15] innocent
[48:16] he says come and let us reason together
[48:19] and if you plead your case right now
[48:22] you'll never have to stand before me
[48:26] again as judge
[48:30] do you realize there's oodles of people
[48:35] that are called to the judgment seat of
[48:37] god
[48:38] and they walk away with less
[48:41] than what they expected
[48:48] because people don't like to go
[48:51] before a judge period
[48:55] they get nervous
[48:57] you know and they want the easy way out
[49:01] they want the easy way out
[49:04] and sometimes the judge says it's not an
[49:06] easy way
[49:08] praise the lord is that right
[49:11] but one thing for sure we're all going
[49:13] to stand before a judgment seat romans
[49:16] 14 and 10 you don't have to read have to
[49:19] turn to it but it says but why dost thou
[49:21] judge thy brother
[49:23] or why dost dog
[49:26] and and
[49:27] uh said it not thy brother and that
[49:30] means
[49:31] to make him utterly nothing
[49:34] in that terrible that a child of god
[49:37] would make a fellow brother utterly
[49:39] nothing
[49:41] for we
[49:42] shall all stand before the judgment seat
[49:45] of christ
[49:47] we all will stand there
[49:51] i've decided that i want to stand
[49:54] before judgment day
[49:56] because when he calls that courtroom
[49:58] that day
[50:00] he doesn't have any positive sentences
[50:03] to pass out
[50:06] but right now he's invited me to come to
[50:09] that judgment seat and reason with him
[50:13] and say hey
[50:15] god i realize i need you
[50:19] i realize that if this was judgment day
[50:23] i would not have a good intention
[50:29] that you might brush me off into that
[50:31] lake of fire
[50:35] see
[50:38] so what did we ask for
[50:41] you know how many has been already been
[50:43] to the judgment seat one time
[50:46] huh how many has been to the judgment
[50:47] seat now i'm not seeing no hands
[50:50] dear god help me
[50:53] maybe i'm barking up the wrong tree here
[50:56] i i would say every one of you have been
[50:59] to the judgment seat and the primary
[51:02] thing that's on our hearts when we
[51:04] approach that judgment seat is that we
[51:06] are a sinner and we need forgiveness
[51:11] because after all he did say though your
[51:14] sins be a scarlet they will be
[51:18] white as snow
[51:23] and so we come
[51:25] and we ask
[51:27] god forgive me
[51:31] how many how many has ever asked for
[51:33] forgiveness come on participate with me
[51:37] come on young people
[51:40] praise the lord it don't hurt you to
[51:42] raise your hands
[51:43] let god know you're still alive all
[51:45] right
[51:46] you know that you're amongst the
[51:48] livingston that you ain't passed out
[51:51] praise the lord
[51:55] we had a couple
[51:56] of of them little kids at youth camp
[51:58] past
[52:00] clean out in the spirit you know
[52:02] and the other ones had never seen
[52:05] 10 through 13 year olds is what i was
[52:06] dealing with and the others had never
[52:08] seen anybody slain in the spirit
[52:11] i went my god where are we coming to
[52:14] all right
[52:16] see but we all stand and we ask for
[52:19] forgiveness
[52:21] you know
[52:24] and we say thank god i believe that
[52:28] my sins are
[52:30] forgiven thank the lord
[52:33] you know
[52:35] and we walk away
[52:38] and what we expected
[52:42] was deliverance
[52:46] what we got was we got our sins forgiven
[52:52] but what we didn't get was what we
[52:54] expected because the first time that i
[52:57] ever went to that throne
[52:59] and that judgment seat i was expecting
[53:02] for deliverance that when i got it from
[53:04] that altar i would walk away and i
[53:07] wouldn't be the same
[53:09] i wouldn't have the same temptations
[53:13] i wouldn't want to cuss every other word
[53:17] come on saints
[53:23] because i was expecting to change
[53:26] brother simmons
[53:28] but what i got was my sins forgiven
[53:35] and i said
[53:37] wow my sins are clean man man i i i
[53:40] might even did it a little dance i used
[53:42] to do a dance a lot of times
[53:45] can you believe that 312 pounds can
[53:47] dance absolutely when the power of god
[53:50] hits him he sure can
[53:54] you know
[53:56] and so here we are we're standing there
[53:58] and we're saying oh thank god my sins
[54:01] are gone
[54:03] we sing that song they're underneath the
[54:05] blood
[54:07] but the problem is i walked right out of
[54:09] the church door
[54:11] here comes a girl down the street
[54:14] practically nothing on
[54:16] and here comes my thoughts
[54:21] wait a minute
[54:23] if my sins forgiven i'm not changed
[54:27] i'm still having the same identical
[54:29] thoughts
[54:33] and let me tell you
[54:35] that just about caused me to give up
[54:38] and it has
[54:40] on a lot of message kids
[54:45] because they're expecting a change
[54:48] and their sins are forgiven and they can
[54:51] feel the cleanliness of the holy ghost
[54:54] washing away all of those sins
[54:57] but then when they get outside
[55:00] there hadn't been a change
[55:06] they're still wanting to watch the same
[55:08] old pornography before
[55:10] you know
[55:12] they're still wanting to smoke the same
[55:15] dope
[55:17] they're still wanting to do everything
[55:19] that they used to do
[55:22] and like i said
[55:24] i said my god
[55:26] wait a minute if this is all it is do i
[55:28] have to keep coming up to that altar
[55:31] every every day and and lay before and
[55:33] say god please forgive me please forgive
[55:35] me wash my sins wash my sins wash my
[55:37] sins
[55:39] because what if he comes just after that
[55:42] good looking girl goes by
[55:45] what if he comes after just after that
[55:48] good looking guy goes by
[55:52] what if he comes after you looked at
[55:55] your mama and defiantly say i will not
[55:58] clean my room up
[56:03] because the bible plainly says if you
[56:05] die in your sins where i am you cannot
[56:08] come
[56:12] this is a little bit different than what
[56:15] i normally bring forth in them
[56:19] see
[56:20] but that scripture we leave that next
[56:22] scripture out
[56:24] if you be willing
[56:27] and obedient
[56:30] wait a minute
[56:34] preachers are preaching that first one
[56:38] oh though your sins be scarlet they
[56:40] shall be white as snow come let me
[56:42] cleanse but they forget to tell you hey
[56:46] there's something that has to continue
[56:49] happening
[56:51] and you have to become willing
[56:58] because if you don't become willing
[57:02] then you'll walk away with forgiving
[57:04] sins
[57:06] praise the lord
[57:07] see
[57:09] you leave this the rejoi the oh oh
[57:13] you're you're saying hallelujah
[57:14] hallelujah my sins are gone
[57:16] but did you get what you expected
[57:21] because you expected a change
[57:27] and you you go away and you say oh thank
[57:30] god
[57:31] my sins are gone
[57:33] but have you changed
[57:36] see
[57:40] did you become willing
[57:45] see
[57:46] because when you become willing
[57:48] something has to break on the inside
[57:53] you know how many how many realizes that
[57:56] you were born selfish
[57:59] come on saints
[58:01] i don't know about you but the reason
[58:03] that baby's crying
[58:05] is not because he wants his mom and dad
[58:07] to have the bottle
[58:13] he's got crying because he wants his mom
[58:16] and dad to to get a diaper
[58:19] come
[58:20] on they were born we are born as selfish
[58:24] individuals
[58:28] we want what we want
[58:33] and we find how to be political about it
[58:38] because you start realizing wait a
[58:40] minute
[58:41] wait a minute you know at first it's
[58:43] selfish it's all me and then mom and
[58:45] dad's actually handsome play with your
[58:47] little sister now
[58:51] come on
[58:52] you know
[58:53] what do you mean you bit little johnny
[58:58] you know
[59:00] here comes the soap
[59:02] yeah because why
[59:06] you're selfish
[59:08] but pretty soon you start getting
[59:09] political about this stuff
[59:11] you start realizing wait a minute
[59:13] if i manipulate
[59:16] yeah
[59:18] i can get the best truck in the sandbox
[59:22] you know
[59:23] come on sites
[59:25] if i manipulate maybe i'm not
[59:29] the best
[59:30] but if i manipulate
[59:33] i can get what i want
[59:36] and let me tell you
[59:38] you know what daddy in here that has
[59:40] about a 14 year old girl that comes to
[59:42] him says daddy
[59:45] she's learned to manipulate you she's
[59:47] got you tied around her finger
[59:50] and i'd be proud of it if i were you
[59:54] because she's got
[59:56] her efforts been towards you and not
[59:58] some guy out there
[1:00:02] because if you don't pay attention to
[1:00:04] her
[1:00:06] somebody is
[1:00:08] somebody is
[1:00:10] see
[1:00:12] so i want everybody to say this morning
[1:00:14] lord
[1:00:16] i want
[1:00:17] what i expected
[1:00:21] that ain't good enough say it louder
[1:00:23] lord i want what i
[1:00:26] expected now hold that thought
[1:00:30] turn in your bibles to saint john the
[1:00:32] third chapter
[1:00:35] is everybody get anybody getting bored
[1:00:37] yet

[1:01:00] how many realizes something has to
[1:01:03] happen

[1:01:09] your will is for you to be blessed
[1:01:15] you know
[1:01:16] and we keep a certain amount of that
[1:01:18] believe it or not because we would never
[1:01:20] be blessed

[1:01:25] the other night when brother isaiah and
[1:01:27] last night when brother leggett was

[1:01:39] because i'm gonna be here
[1:01:43] see
[1:01:44] and i knew the same god that was with
[1:01:46] them would meet me here
[1:01:50] so some of that you need to keep
[1:01:54] but most of it needs to die
[1:02:00] nicodemus comes
[1:02:03] and he asks the million-dollar question
[1:02:06] how did i get into this thing
[1:02:10] and i don't know how many of
[1:02:12] you have stood studied about the book of
[1:02:14] john let me ask you a question
[1:02:16] how many here can quote john 3 16.
[1:02:22] how many can quote john 3 16. i'm seeing
[1:02:24] probably 20 people anymore
[1:02:26] all right
[1:02:28] you know why
[1:02:29] because it's one of the most popular
[1:02:32] verses in christianity
[1:02:36] for god so loved the world
[1:02:38] why brother junior why why is it not
[1:02:42] john 3 3 that is more important
[1:02:50] because john 3 16 takes us doing nothing
[1:02:53] just believe
[1:02:56] but john 3 3
[1:02:58] takes a death
[1:03:07] see for for some of y'all that may not
[1:03:10] know the book of john was actually he
[1:03:12] wrote that after the book of revelations
[1:03:17] and that's why he didn't start it with
[1:03:19] so-and-so but god so and so so and so
[1:03:21] but god so and so so and so but got that
[1:03:24] because when john stood there he said in
[1:03:26] the beginning
[1:03:27] was the word
[1:03:29] because he had a revelation of who it
[1:03:31] was
[1:03:35] i'm sorry i've been got off on adults
[1:03:38] forgive me
[1:03:40] see
[1:03:41] and so here they are
[1:03:43] here he stands there nicodemus is
[1:03:45] wanting how do you get into this thing
[1:03:51] you know
[1:03:52] and a lot of people ask that question
[1:03:55] and we say just believe
[1:04:04] john 3 3 jesus answered and said unto
[1:04:07] him early i say unto thee accept
[1:04:10] a man be born again and to uh be born
[1:04:14] again he cannot
[1:04:16] even
[1:04:17] see
[1:04:18] the kingdom of god
[1:04:21] now we brother brother simmons so
[1:04:24] you know i'm sitting here saying man
[1:04:25] they're preaching my message they might
[1:04:26] as well just go on to do it
[1:04:28] you know brother simon setting up here
[1:04:30] last night he said what was the holy
[1:04:32] ghost see
[1:04:35] the kingdom of god
[1:04:38] is the holy ghost
[1:04:41] and he says he says you can't even see
[1:04:44] the holy ghost
[1:04:47] until you're born again
[1:04:51] but wait a minute brother junior i
[1:04:53] danced i jumped i leaped i ran
[1:04:58] but when i went back outside that tent
[1:05:01] i was doing the same identical things
[1:05:05] you didn't see the holy ghost
[1:05:08] it kind of fell on your flesh
[1:05:11] as brother brooks said the cockaburg
[1:05:14] because i got a quote on that
[1:05:18] you know
[1:05:19] that cockerborough frat flesh
[1:05:22] it might have fell on that
[1:05:25] but you ain't been born again
[1:05:30] later on jesus says
[1:05:32] that you can't enter into the holy ghost
[1:05:36] without being born again
[1:05:38] see
[1:05:42] see when we approached god for
[1:05:44] forgiveness
[1:05:46] we came in the nature
[1:05:49] that we were born with
[1:05:51] our selfless nature
[1:05:55] you know
[1:05:57] you brothers and sisters
[1:06:00] do you ever fight
[1:06:02] tell the truth tell the truth all right
[1:06:05] how many times in a week just in a week
[1:06:10] five times
[1:06:11] all right do you concur with that at
[1:06:13] least five or more
[1:06:15] all right he says five do you ever fight
[1:06:17] with your brother
[1:06:19] yeah
[1:06:20] why
[1:06:23] they just happen to be setting up here
[1:06:25] y'all kids are hid back air amongst you
[1:06:28] huh
[1:06:30] why do you fight
[1:06:32] because you want something
[1:06:35] you want it your way
[1:06:39] i can tell you why kids fight they want
[1:06:41] it their way
[1:06:45] and if they don't get it their way
[1:06:48] why because they were born with a
[1:06:50] selfish nature on them
[1:06:56] and and jesus said you're telling
[1:06:58] nicodemus
[1:07:00] you want to enter into the kingdom
[1:07:04] be borne again
[1:07:06] get rid of that old nature
[1:07:10] and get a new nature
[1:07:17] he says then you will change
[1:07:22] is that what he said
[1:07:24] see
[1:07:25] because you can't enter into the kingdom
[1:07:27] of god you can't even look on the
[1:07:28] kingdom of god
[1:07:30] see
[1:07:31] ephesians 2 3 says among whom also we
[1:07:35] all had our conversation in times past
[1:07:39] so i want to tell you your mom and dad
[1:07:41] used to argue with their brothers and
[1:07:42] sisters too
[1:07:44] all right
[1:07:46] in the lust of their flesh fulfilling
[1:07:48] what the desires of the flesh and the
[1:07:51] mind and were by nature the children of
[1:07:54] wrath even as others
[1:07:57] see all about us
[1:08:02] have you ever seen somebody that goes to
[1:08:04] church that has not had a new birth
[1:08:08] watch them it's going to be that's going
[1:08:11] to be the biggest complainer in the
[1:08:12] church
[1:08:15] the music's too fast the music's too
[1:08:17] slow it's too loud it's too soft
[1:08:21] it's too hot it's too cold
[1:08:27] why because you're selfish
[1:08:32] you know
[1:08:36] all you have to do if you pastor for a
[1:08:38] while you'll figure out
[1:08:42] you know but that child of god that
[1:08:44] comes in and says i don't care if
[1:08:46] icebergs form on my nostrils i'm going
[1:08:49] to worship god
[1:08:52] that's the one that's had some kind of
[1:08:55] change on the inside
[1:09:00] oh there goes my nose
[1:09:04] and unfortunately with my age i gotta
[1:09:07] have him
[1:09:10] it used to be i didn't have to have
[1:09:13] praise the lord
[1:09:14] see
[1:09:18] yeah
[1:09:20] now watch
[1:09:22] we have
[1:09:24] how many realizes
[1:09:29] the reason our desires didn't change
[1:09:32] was because we
[1:09:34] didn't want to become willing
[1:09:38] to change
[1:09:41] that's the key
[1:09:42] it's not a great big revelation
[1:09:46] because if you
[1:09:48] want to change
[1:09:49] you will change
[1:09:53] i think it was back in
[1:09:54] 2018
[1:09:56] i think it was
[1:09:58] i decided
[1:10:00] i don't want to weigh over 400 pounds
[1:10:04] anymore
[1:10:07] and i
[1:10:08] started working on it
[1:10:10] and i've lost 100 pounds
[1:10:14] because i don't want to be that way no
[1:10:16] don't clap it's all god
[1:10:21] see
[1:10:22] but something on the inside of me said
[1:10:25] i don't want to do that anymore
[1:10:30] now i watch what i eat
[1:10:34] you know
[1:10:35] careful with what i choose
[1:10:40] great revelation ain't it
[1:10:43] so so difficult
[1:10:45] everybody has such a hard time
[1:10:48] no not if you really want
[1:10:53] because this is the part of selfishness
[1:10:55] that you're supposed to keep
[1:10:58] i
[1:11:00] want something
[1:11:02] and it's not
[1:11:04] a new car it's not a new house it's not
[1:11:06] a new toy it's not a new bicycle it's
[1:11:08] not a new pair of of
[1:11:10] tennis shoes that cost 350 dollars
[1:11:15] it's one thing
[1:11:18] it's one simple thing jesus
[1:11:21] that's all i want
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:24] i have become willing
[1:11:28] and now i can eat in the good of the
[1:11:30] land
[1:11:32] i can receive the holy ghost
[1:11:36] because i've laid my desire on the altar
[1:11:44] see
[1:11:45] christ
[1:11:47] set an example in that garden that a lot
[1:11:49] of people do not realize
[1:11:53] because how many realize he was in the
[1:11:55] flesh just like we are
[1:11:59] there was something in him that rose up
[1:12:02] it wasn't sin
[1:12:06] see that's why i say you can keep that
[1:12:09] selfishness
[1:12:11] it was a sin
[1:12:14] you know
[1:12:17] it was
[1:12:18] his will
[1:12:20] had to break
[1:12:22] that's what the prophetess god said
[1:12:25] his will
[1:12:26] cracked in half and he said lord
[1:12:30] nevertheless
[1:12:33] let it be thine will and not mine
[1:12:42] you sitting there
[1:12:45] you know you girls
[1:12:49] and and i've worked with young people
[1:12:51] since i was 18 years old like i said
[1:12:53] and i ain't telling you how old i am now
[1:12:55] but i got gray hair ain't
[1:12:57] right
[1:12:59] and so i've pretty well seen just about
[1:13:01] every trick in the book
[1:13:02] i think every once in a while one
[1:13:04] surprises me
[1:13:07] a little girl 17 years old
[1:13:10] come to the altar week her eyes out i
[1:13:13] mean
[1:13:14] a puddle of tears
[1:13:17] surely surely brother junior she got a
[1:13:19] new birth
[1:13:23] she wore her long dresses one day to
[1:13:25] school
[1:13:27] i can tell you this girl's name
[1:13:29] brother isaiah brooks may be able to
[1:13:31] remember her
[1:13:32] because she repented under his ministry
[1:13:41] and all the kids
[1:13:42] t's tc's oh grandma
[1:13:45] that that you know how they do
[1:13:47] you know because it's become bullying
[1:13:49] now rather than just teasing
[1:13:52] they start
[1:13:53] being vindictive over because they're
[1:13:56] devils
[1:14:00] and see
[1:14:02] and so we don't know what sometimes if
[1:14:04] we're sending kids to public school what
[1:14:06] we're sending them to
[1:14:09] but anyway
[1:14:11] the next day
[1:14:13] she found
[1:14:15] actually she had already gotten rid of
[1:14:17] all of her her her shorts and her her
[1:14:21] her pants and stuff so she borrowed a
[1:14:24] pair
[1:14:26] put them in a bag
[1:14:29] went down to the corner where she caught
[1:14:30] the bus it was a filament station went
[1:14:33] into filling station put her pants on
[1:14:35] took her skirt off
[1:14:40] had she had a new birth
[1:14:46] you know
[1:14:50] because see new births cause you to own
[1:14:52] up to what's
[1:14:54] inside mama and daddy
[1:14:57] i got a problem
[1:14:59] i'm still pulled to those things
[1:15:02] i need to die out
[1:15:06] but instead what did she do
[1:15:08] she hid it away
[1:15:11] next revival meeting here she's there at
[1:15:13] the altar
[1:15:15] weeping and crying
[1:15:17] and see some other people word had
[1:15:19] already gotten back to me i was the
[1:15:21] youth leader at that time and and
[1:15:25] word had already gotten back to me what
[1:15:26] she was doing
[1:15:28] and i'm praying and going god do i
[1:15:30] expose this to the to the parents do i
[1:15:32] what do i do with this
[1:15:34] you know next revival comes along and
[1:15:36] she's up there weeping and crying again
[1:15:43] and she never
[1:15:45] i bet she she went to that altar 50
[1:15:47] times
[1:15:49] that i've known that young lady and
[1:15:51] today
[1:15:52] she's a drug addict
[1:15:56] and the reason why because
[1:15:58] she never would have a new birth
[1:16:06] and finally i sat down at her with her
[1:16:08] dad you know it went on for for a few
[1:16:11] few you know a few weeks and so i sat
[1:16:14] down with her dad
[1:16:16] and her dad said i don't know what i'm
[1:16:17] going to do
[1:16:23] you know
[1:16:24] and i'm saying you better be praying
[1:16:27] you better be praying
[1:16:30] because if she don't have a new birth
[1:16:32] it's gonna go deeper
[1:16:36] and see
[1:16:37] she always feels like she can come back
[1:16:39] to that religious spirit that's waiting
[1:16:41] for her at that altar
[1:16:43] and walk away feeling as clean as clean
[1:16:46] can be is she clean absolutely
[1:16:49] because god don't lie
[1:16:53] if you ask forgiveness he's going to
[1:16:55] forgive you
[1:16:56] if you ask for cleansing he's going to
[1:16:58] cleanse you
[1:17:02] is brother junior being a little rough
[1:17:04] this morning
[1:17:07] see
[1:17:14] see well listen
[1:17:18] see knowing this romans six
[1:17:20] let's let's do this knowing this that
[1:17:22] our old man is crucified with him that
[1:17:25] the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:17:29] now if something's destroyed
[1:17:34] you know
[1:17:37] what does that mean
[1:17:39] somebody tell me
[1:17:41] something's destroyed
[1:17:43] is it usable again
[1:17:49] can you use it
[1:17:52] oh
[1:17:53] i went to the altar and and i backslide
[1:17:58] did your old man
[1:18:01] become destroyed
[1:18:06] because that's what my bible says
[1:18:08] happens
[1:18:10] you don't have something to fall back to
[1:18:15] it ain't there no more
[1:18:22] so don't tell me you sit there and
[1:18:24] backslid
[1:18:30] you might have walked out of the grace
[1:18:31] of god but you didn't backslide
[1:18:34] not if you had a new birth
[1:18:43] man the hair on my back of my neck is
[1:18:45] standing up straight
[1:18:50] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:18:53] then henceforth
[1:18:54] we should not serve sin
[1:18:58] now listen for he that is dead
[1:19:02] is freed from sin amen
[1:19:18] i ain't got nothing behind me
[1:19:20] all i got heaven before me
[1:19:26] god said he destroyed it
[1:19:29] annihilated it
[1:19:32] you can't find the dna of that old body
[1:19:43] hallelujah
[1:19:46] say brother junior are you still tempted
[1:19:49] absolutely
[1:19:51] but see i realize i ain't got nothing to
[1:19:53] go back
[1:19:57] so i might as well push forward
[1:20:00] god
[1:20:02] you promise grace
[1:20:05] and i want grace
[1:20:08] help me
[1:20:14] the young people sits there
[1:20:16] and they come up here
[1:20:17] and they say i got it
[1:20:19] i got it
[1:20:21] all right let me let me get to the quote
[1:20:23] lord mercy it's already 12 o'clock
[1:20:27] so you see
[1:20:28] the same rain that makes the wheat grow
[1:20:31] makes the cocker world grow
[1:20:33] and therefore
[1:20:35] i got the picture
[1:20:38] there
[1:20:39] your carnal confessor
[1:20:42] that's right in the church
[1:20:44] but his fruit
[1:20:48] he might shout jump dance speak with
[1:20:51] tons
[1:20:52] but his fruit
[1:20:55] he's a cocker burl
[1:20:58] and there's the other one that's got the
[1:21:00] same spirit the holy spirit can drop
[1:21:03] right in a bunch of people and a
[1:21:05] hypocrite can shout by the holy spirit
[1:21:08] just the same as a cocker bird can live
[1:21:11] by the rain that sent that's what paul's
[1:21:14] speaking of here
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:21] oh brother i i don't understand
[1:21:24] the power of god i know it was the power
[1:21:25] of god to hit me

[1:21:29] with this girl that i'm not married to

[1:21:56] teaching ain't going on very much these
[1:21:58] days
[1:22:00] but there was a daddy taught his girls
[1:22:02] he said if any boy even touches you
[1:22:06] he said you command them to take their
[1:22:09] your hand he said the only one should be
[1:22:11] touching you is a man of god
[1:22:14] and i said that's strong teaching well i
[1:22:17] happen to be at youth camp
[1:22:19] and here's this girl i'm coming down

[1:22:29] that little girl was standing there and
[1:22:32] she had like four girls around her and
[1:22:34] boys and all of a sudden it was a boy
[1:22:37] laid his hand on this girl's shoulder
[1:22:42] and i caught it out of the corner of my
[1:22:44] eye and i went oh gracious day
[1:22:46] because i know what that little girl was
[1:22:48] taught
[1:22:50] and that little girl said sir

[1:24:08] sitting in a service
[1:24:14] and somebody looks over and he just
[1:24:16] receives a picture
[1:24:20] from a girl
[1:24:22] and she ain't got nothing on
[1:24:25] i said how in the world
[1:24:29] can they say they've got new bursts
[1:24:32] shouting dancing the spirit
[1:24:36] and with that kind of mess going on

[1:24:47] presses towards perfection into the
[1:24:50] world is dead
[1:24:52] and you become a new creature in christ
[1:24:55] jesus
[1:24:56] that's it's impossible for that man to
[1:25:00] ever
[1:25:01] fall
[1:25:03] did anybody hear that
[1:25:07] impossible
[1:25:10] paul said he destroyed it
[1:25:17] get that old man destroyed this morning
[1:25:20] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:25:25] see we're before the judgment seat
[1:25:28] god's inviting you come
[1:25:29] come
[1:25:31] come to the judgment seat
[1:25:34] and paul says if you judge yourself
[1:25:37] you don't need to be judged
[1:25:44] god i need you
[1:25:46] that was when he turned the mic over
[1:25:48] that's what we were singing lord i need
[1:25:51] you right now
[1:25:54] but i wonder in people's minds that were
[1:25:57] setting under this tent if you were
[1:25:59] actually
[1:26:01] saying
[1:26:02] my god i need you
[1:26:06] i've got things in my life
[1:26:08] that i need to
[1:26:09] pour out before you
[1:26:13] and get rid of
[1:26:15] kill it
[1:26:17] before it multiplies
[1:26:28] that's what the bible says
[1:26:31] see how that compares with the rest of
[1:26:33] the scripture see how it lays right in
[1:26:36] there in its place
[1:26:40] he says if we judge ourselves
[1:26:44] we should not be judged
[1:26:50] wow there they go let them go this time
[1:26:54] because we're finished
[1:26:58] because god has made us
[1:27:01] overcomers
[1:27:05] there's nothing in your life
[1:27:08] that you cannot
[1:27:09] get rid of
[1:27:13] i've seen i've seen drug addicts
[1:27:17] i've seen nicotine devils
[1:27:21] countless
[1:27:26] i've seen the spirit of homosexuality
[1:27:28] delivered amen several times
[1:27:39] i've told you all this story i'm pretty
[1:27:41] sure
[1:27:49] preacher's kid
[1:27:50] i get woke up at 3 30 in the morning
[1:27:55] preacher's kid
[1:27:58] you say brother junior why does
[1:28:00] preachers kids always have such a
[1:28:02] problem
[1:28:03] it's because
[1:28:05] normally the preacher is so busy trying
[1:28:07] to save your kids
[1:28:12] i know
[1:28:13] i know
[1:28:14] i'm not blaming nobody
[1:28:17] but i'm saying
[1:28:19] preachers it's hard for us to keep our
[1:28:22] family and keep keep your family too
[1:28:27] and here's a preacher's kid
[1:28:30] brother jr
[1:28:32] i need for you to pray with me
[1:28:37] brother
[1:28:38] i know your daddy
[1:28:40] what a tremendous preacher of gospel
[1:28:43] you don't not need me to pray for you
[1:28:46] you know go get your dad and i'll pray
[1:28:48] for you
[1:28:52] he said brother junior
[1:28:54] i got something that i can't tell nobody
[1:28:56] else
[1:28:58] and when he said that i said i know
[1:29:00] where he's going
[1:29:07] because see we are in the age you say
[1:29:10] brother junior that spirit doesn't get
[1:29:12] around the message oh yes it does
[1:29:21] you know and then to that boy grew up he
[1:29:24] was
[1:29:26] 14 years old i believe 15 years old
[1:29:30] and until he grew up got married he's
[1:29:33] got children now he finally
[1:29:36] stopped emailing me and saying brother
[1:29:39] how sweet jesus christ is
[1:29:42] just as a reminder
[1:29:44] he said i just want to remind myself
[1:29:47] what god did that night
[1:29:52] it ain't nothing you can't
[1:29:55] god will destroy anything you put in
[1:29:57] front of him
[1:30:00] but are you willing
[1:30:02] see
[1:30:04] we go right back to the same question
[1:30:07] are you willing
[1:30:09] and obedient
[1:30:13] and if you're not willing and obedient
[1:30:18] then how can you ever expect to make it
[1:30:22] like i said we re we recite john 3 16
[1:30:25] for god's who loved the world that he
[1:30:27] gave his only begotten son that
[1:30:28] whosoever believeth on him shall have
[1:30:31] eternal life
[1:30:34] everlasting life
[1:30:40] but do we ask ourselves god
[1:30:43] am i born again
[1:30:47] has my nature died
[1:30:50] or am i just shouting in the services
[1:30:53] feeling the presence of god when it
[1:30:55] falls just like an old cocker bird
[1:30:59] growing
[1:31:01] like a weed
[1:31:06] it's up to you
[1:31:10] the altar is open this morning
[1:31:16] i don't believe god sent me clean from
[1:31:18] richmond virginia down here to preach
[1:31:20] this message because without a shadow of
[1:31:22] a doubt
[1:31:24] i believe it had to come forth this
[1:31:25] morning
[1:31:29] i know it hadn't been the shouting
[1:31:31] message that a lot of a lot of times
[1:31:34] still is delivered
[1:31:37] it's the message that starts making you
[1:31:39] examine yourself
[1:31:42] because young people we don't have very
[1:31:44] much longer
[1:31:50] just any day now
[1:31:52] i'm expecting him to split the eastern
[1:31:55] skies
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:31:58] and what
[1:31:59] if you are not born again
[1:32:03] you
[1:32:04] you will not make it in the rapture
[1:32:08] i'm not trying to say whether you'll
[1:32:10] make it in in the church and all of that
[1:32:12] other stuff that doctrine i just leave
[1:32:14] out
[1:32:16] because i won't accept make it into the
[1:32:18] church
[1:32:20] i want to make it into wrath
[1:32:26] i've even prayed god if i can't make it
[1:32:28] in the rapture then go on to slay me now
[1:32:36] but isn't there somebody
[1:32:39] there one
[1:32:43] let's all stand
[1:32:53] you say brother junior what did that do
[1:32:55] when you stood up you got just a little
[1:32:57] more closer
[1:33:00] to taking that first step
[1:33:04] this altar is open
[1:33:07] you say brother i've had i've had
[1:33:10] i've been to that altar 50 times
[1:33:14] and i've never changed
[1:33:16] and i've heard that testimony
[1:33:21] and that's what causes me to preach this
[1:33:23] message

[1:33:50] you've got to give me an answer
[1:33:54] and that's what he gave me
[1:33:57] was
[1:33:58] you've not become willing
[1:34:03] do you know how hard it is to look
[1:34:06] at a teenage young man and said
[1:34:08] the reason why you're not born again is
[1:34:11] because
[1:34:12] you've not become willing
[1:34:17] isn't there somebody in here this
[1:34:19] morning
