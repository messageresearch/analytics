[35:39] thank you tonight for your grace and
[35:40] your mercy.
[35:42] Oh God, thank you for making everything
[35:44] all right.

[35:54] throne of grace, Lord. And oh God, we
[35:56] ask, oh God, that you continue granting
[35:59] mercy, Lord, to those that were in the
[36:01] storm's way, God. And think about our
[36:04] friends over in Jamaica, Lord, and
[36:06] brothers and sisters in Christ. Lord, I
[36:09] just pray, God, that you'd make ways for
[36:11] them. And oh God, so many that were
[36:13] affected, Lord. And oh God, we just
[36:16] thank you, Lord, tonight. Lord, we pray,
[36:18] oh God, by your grace, Lord, that you
[36:21] would speak to our hearts tonight, Lord,
[36:23] and that you would meet the needs of
[36:25] your children, Lord, if we said or did
[36:27] anything that ain't like you and if it
[36:28] would hinder the move of God. I just
[36:30] pray God that you would oh God forgive
[36:33] us tonight oh Lord and help us to get
[36:35] out the way Lord that your spirit might
[36:38] have the preeminence Lord that you would
[36:40] touch bodies Lord those that are
[36:42] battling with sicknesses God and but
[36:44] Lord we know that they're only demon
[36:46] powers Lord but you're still here oh God
[36:49] Lord to to bring about change we thank
[36:52] you Lord tonight bless your children oh
[36:56] God we pray move in a mighty way bless
[36:58] those that are here those that had a
[37:00] desire to come but couldn't make it.
[37:01] Pray God you would strengthen them
[37:03] somehow. In [music] Jesus Christ's name
[37:05] we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is good.
[37:09] Amen. We want to look at the book of
[37:11] Hebrews by the grace of God. Hebrews 3.
[37:15] Very familiar scripture. Amen. Tell we
[37:18] was looking at that that storm that come
[37:21] over and hit those islands. It looked to
[37:23] be pretty bad. So that one storm covered
[37:26] it looked the storm was so big it
[37:28] covered the whole island of Jamaica. I
[37:31] said Lord knows. I was praying. I says I
[37:33] pray that God had mercy on all the
[37:35] saints of God over there. Amen. But we
[37:38] know we living in the end time. Amen. So
[37:41] glad that we got a hiding place though.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 3 by the grace of God.
[37:46] Hebrews 3 and 7. Very familiar.
[37:51] If you got it, say amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Wherefore, as the
[37:55] Holy Ghost saith, today if you if ye
[37:59] will hear his voice, harden not your
[38:01] hearts as in provocation in the day of
[38:05] temptation in the wilderness, when your
[38:07] fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
[38:10] my works 40 years. Wherefore I was
[38:13] grieved with that generation, and said,
[38:16] they do always er in their way in their
[38:19] heart, and they have not known my ways."
[38:22] So I swear in my wrath they should not
[38:25] enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren,
[38:28] lest there be in any of you an evil
[38:31] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[38:34] living God. But exhort one another daily
[38:37] while it is called today, lest any of
[38:39] you be hardened through the
[38:42] deceitfulness of sin. For we are made
[38:44] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[38:48] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[38:50] until the end. May God bless you to read
[38:52] of his word. You may be seated tonight.
[38:56] You know, tonight by the grace of God
[38:58] for a moment, I just want to to talk to
[39:01] you about departing from the living God.
[39:03] Amen. Departing from the living God. You
[39:07] know how like how here it says you know
[39:09] in the scriptures he's saying wherefore
[39:12] wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today
[39:15] if you will hear his voice harden not
[39:18] your hearts as in the day of temptation
[39:21] in the wilderness wherein your fathers
[39:24] tempted me and prove me not only did
[39:26] they prove him but they saw his works.
[39:28] Amen. But he says the day that you hear
[39:30] his voice don't harden your hearts.
[39:32] Right? You know, we find that, you know,
[39:35] I said throughout all the all the
[39:37] scriptures, you know, we find that that
[39:40] God does things to show himself alive
[39:44] and isn't uh long before people depart
[39:47] from the living God. Amen. Something
[39:49] about the for some reason the attraction
[39:52] that people they don't they feel
[39:54] comfortable serving a God that ain't
[39:56] living. Amen. Not necessarily that
[39:59] they're calling on a different God, but
[40:01] you know, he doesn't just to uh uh be
[40:05] intellectual. That isn't that isn't the
[40:08] living God. Amen. Because we know that
[40:10] the scripture said the letter will kill
[40:12] you, but it's the spirit, right, that
[40:14] gives life. But we find that, you know,
[40:17] many of times people get caught up in
[40:20] the we say the intellectualism or the or
[40:22] thing, but it's the it's the spirit that
[40:24] gives life. Amen. And that's what you
[40:26] know I was thinking I says a lot of
[40:28] times people when they when they just uh
[40:31] uh intellectual or or they just smart
[40:34] you know in that way then many of times
[40:37] they think that they can take the word
[40:39] and just handle it any kind of way they
[40:41] want right or that makes them qualified
[40:44] to be a a teacher or a leader or
[40:46] everybody becomes super spiritual right
[40:49] but the thing is is that you know God
[40:52] reveals his secrets in the word we know
[40:55] his word the word come to the prophets
[40:56] but you know it God God gives the gifts
[41:01] out to men right men don't you can't
[41:04] give a gift for yourself God's got to
[41:05] give you that gift right
[41:07] &gt;&gt; and many of times people cover covered
[41:09] those things because they want to be the
[41:12] person of the hour want to be the one
[41:13] that God use right but like I said the
[41:17] thing about it is is God's got to be be
[41:20] the one give you that gift right other
[41:22] than that you going to make a shipwreck
[41:24] of people lives us. How many believe
[41:26] that tonight? You'll take the word
[41:28] intellectually and mix it and make it
[41:29] and the devil will make everything sound
[41:31] good, right? But no matter how good it
[41:34] sounds like it says when you had to come
[41:35] before the urine thrum, no matter how
[41:37] real that dream sounded, no matter how
[41:40] real and and logical it might seem, but
[41:43] the supernatural had to flash across it,
[41:46] right, to prove that it was from God.
[41:48] How many believe that tonight? And
[41:50] that's what I always I've been saying
[41:52] here recently, you know, doing a lot of
[41:54] uh witnessing and you know at work and
[41:56] stuff and talking. I says one thing
[41:58] about it, everybody claims that they
[42:00] have the truth, right? That they have
[42:02] the the the truth and God is with them.
[42:05] I says, but I know one thing that I'm
[42:07] confident of is that God will back his
[42:09] word up, right? Whatever is the truth,
[42:12] God will back it up. No matter how good
[42:14] it looks or how good it sounds, God will
[42:16] back his word up. How many believe that
[42:18] tonight? You know, I was thinking I says
[42:20] one thing about it, you know, God God uh
[42:24] he he comes and and he'll do
[42:26] supernatural things, right? To show you
[42:28] that he's alive and well and he'll show
[42:30] you the way. But it what happens is many
[42:34] of times people even in that they still
[42:36] want to follow their own guidelines,
[42:38] right? Still want to follow their own
[42:40] rules, right? And think that, you know,
[42:42] uh uh God will just accept it. But you
[42:45] know, I thought about the a Cain and
[42:46] Abel and how when they were making their
[42:48] sacrifices, right? The thing about it is
[42:50] God, he came down and he confirmed which
[42:53] sacrifice that he loved, right? Which
[42:55] one was right? But even though he
[42:58] confirmed it and he even spoke to Cain
[43:00] and says, "Why you why you mad?" You
[43:02] know, he says, "If you do like your
[43:04] brother doing, come on, cuz that's the
[43:06] way that's what I'm accepting. You do
[43:08] what he doing." He says, "And I'll
[43:09] accept you." But Cain didn't want to do
[43:11] what God was accepting, did he? He
[43:14] wanted to do his own way. And we find
[43:16] that that what it is. It's a spirit,
[43:17] ain't it? You know, I thought about
[43:19] that, you know, when when I've been
[43:21] ministering on here lately about the
[43:24] awakening and how, you know, Moses uh uh
[43:26] God sent Moses down to deliver the to
[43:29] bring the children out of Israel, even
[43:30] though he was the one doing the
[43:31] delivering, but you had so many voices,
[43:34] right? So many voices am in the among in
[43:37] the camp amongst the people, right? I
[43:40] says, "But where were those voices when
[43:41] they were bound in Egypt? Come on. Where
[43:44] were those voices when they when Pharaoh
[43:46] had them bound? Right. But then now now
[43:50] when God brought them out, God did
[43:52] mighty works, great works and things
[43:54] among them. And now they get out there
[43:56] and they think that they was just going
[43:57] to be able to manhandle Moses, do what
[43:59] they want now. Right? Those voices rose
[44:02] up, didn't they? Come on. And they
[44:04] thought that we know the way we don't
[44:05] need uh uh uh Moses in that particular
[44:08] uh sense like that. But what it was, the
[44:10] one thing they didn't understand is that
[44:12] God is the one who set men up. Right?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; God is the one. And most of the time,
[44:17] the one that God choose, he never wanted
[44:19] to go from the beginning, right?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; He might just want to be a regular old
[44:23] common person, but nevertheless, like I
[44:26] say, it's God that chooses, right? And
[44:28] that's what blinds the people so many of
[44:30] times because of one thing. People got
[44:33] uh motives and objectives, right? They
[44:35] got ambitions and goals. But one of the
[44:37] things coming to Christ is that you have
[44:40] to learn to lay down all of what you all
[44:42] of your ambitions, all of your goals,
[44:45] right?
[44:45] &gt;&gt; I often say it's all right to have
[44:47] things that you want to achieve and all
[44:49] that. I says, but when you when you when
[44:51] one of the things come to Christ, even I
[44:53] had to realize that God, I I got certain
[44:57] things I desire, but Lord, don't let my
[44:59] desires take me outside of your will.
[45:02] Nevertheless, change my will. change my
[45:04] desires that they'll meet up to yours,
[45:06] God. Hallelujah. Because that's what
[45:08] it's all about. How many believe that
[45:10] tonight? Come on. But God does a a lot
[45:13] of things and and he shows himself like
[45:15] we says uh many of times, you know, uh
[45:18] uh uh uh uh what the he shows himself
[45:21] alive and well, but it ain't long for
[45:23] the people depart from him. You know, I
[45:25] says I says, you know, one thing about
[45:28] Satan, he don't mind he don't mind you
[45:31] quoting the Bible. He don't mind you
[45:33] quoting the the message or service,
[45:35] things like that. He don't mind you
[45:36] quoting to say any good things. But what
[45:39] he's keep what he wants you to stay away
[45:41] from is the life of it.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; He says here in the scriptures, as the
[45:47] Holy Ghost says, see people don't want
[45:49] the Holy Ghost to lead them.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he he's a judge now, ain't
[45:54] he? But one thing about it, he want to
[45:56] keep you away from the life of it. But
[45:59] we know that I says I don't know about
[46:01] you, but I don't just want just to give
[46:03] me the letter that I can quote and do
[46:05] all these things, but I want the life of
[46:07] it.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. I want that when I'm when I
[46:10] speak or when I open my mouth that God
[46:12] will back it up. Hallelujah.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; With signs and wonders following. That's
[46:16] what it is. He's not a dead God, but
[46:18] he's a living God, ain't he?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. When when Christ died and and
[46:22] went on, he be to tell them, "I want you
[46:24] to go and tarry and wait till you be
[46:26] endured with power from on high. I don't
[46:28] want you to slip back. Now, God is
[46:30] living, but I don't want you to slip
[46:31] back into day to worship, but I want you
[46:34] to continue on in the living God. Right?
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why on the day of Pentecost,
[46:39] when Peter and those got up and begin to
[46:42] speak with tongues and do all kind of
[46:44] things in the in the in the uh in the
[46:45] name of Christ after the Holy Ghost
[46:47] fell, they begin to look at them certain
[46:49] way. They says, come on. They said,
[46:50] "These men ain't he said these men ain't
[46:52] drunk as ye supposed, but this is that."
[46:55] Come on. You know that scriptures y'all
[46:57] been reading? You know that. But this is
[46:58] the life of it. This is the very living.
[47:01] This is this is the life of what you've
[47:03] been reading. Hallelujah.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's what I say is what
[47:06] it is. God God spoke words, right? And
[47:09] God, he is a living God, ain't he? I
[47:11] believe how uh David says that my soul,
[47:14] he said uh uh uh panth for the living
[47:18] God, right? As the heart panth for the
[47:20] water, soul does my soul. It thirst for
[47:23] the living God. For the God, he said the
[47:25] living God. He had to make that uh uh uh
[47:28] very well known that not just for God
[47:30] now, but the living God, right?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. I said that's how you you
[47:36] ought to feel tonight. That's how I
[47:37] feel. God, I want the living God, right?
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Not just don't just give me anything,
[47:42] but God, I want to Why? Why do I want a
[47:44] living God? You see the struggles and
[47:46] the and the things that's coming on
[47:47] earth today.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You see the trials and the tribulation.
[47:50] You see the storm after storm. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I heard the other day an earthquake hit
[47:54] over in Oregon or somewhere like that.
[47:55] Big earthquake under the water on the
[47:58] news, right? You you see the thing
[47:59] that's coming, you going to need more
[48:01] than just, oh, quote this, quote that,
[48:03] say this, say that scripture like that.
[48:05] But you going to need the life of it,
[48:06] right?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You going to need the life of it cuz
[48:08] when that storm come, hallelujah. He
[48:11] says that one thing about it, what
[48:13] people don't realize is that Jesus is
[48:17] not no more that he he's saying why you
[48:20] marveling. He says that if you can have
[48:22] faith, right?
[48:23] &gt;&gt; He says then all things are possible,
[48:25] right?
[48:26] &gt;&gt; It'll do as you say. What it is? He
[48:28] wants to put the word in your mouth,
[48:30] right?
[48:31] &gt;&gt; That you can speak and it'll be as you
[48:33] say. But people struggle with that,
[48:35] right? They struggle with that. But one
[48:38] thing about it, the Holy Ghost don't
[48:39] want you to struggle with that, right?
[48:41] He just want you to let go and let him
[48:43] have his way in your life. That it ain't
[48:45] you, but it's him speaking, ain't it?
[48:47] Come on. on that when the storm come,
[48:49] you'll be able to stand up and call
[48:50] peace to the storm,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; peace to the trial, right? Hallelujah.
[48:54] How many believe that tonight?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; But I says one thing about it. Come on.
[48:58] Departing. You know that they they
[49:00] departed from the living God. And that's
[49:02] what uh uh uh he's here speaking about
[49:04] tonight, right? He says what what caused
[49:07] them uh uh to depart from the living God
[49:10] was unbelief. How many believe that?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. In them they had a evil heart.
[49:16] The Bible says unbelief, right? He said
[49:18] they that they they they saw my works,
[49:21] right? It wasn't that they never saw the
[49:23] power, they saw the power, right?
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that they never heard the voice,
[49:27] they heard the voice. They saw the
[49:29] power. But somewhere in the in the in
[49:31] the journey, they departed from the
[49:33] living God. Right?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Not that they didn't hear, they didn't
[49:38] see, but they saw, they heard, but they
[49:40] departed. Come on. I says what it is.
[49:43] Sometimes we get so comfortable, right?
[49:46] Because God has took the the the great
[49:49] look like the greatest thing that was
[49:51] bothering you. He looked like he moved
[49:52] it out the way. So you get comfortable,
[49:54] right? Thinking that now maybe we don't
[49:56] need God. But I want to tell you, you
[49:58] need God every day.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. You need God every hour. Just
[50:02] cuz the storm looked like it let up.
[50:04] Don't think you don't need God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz tomorrow might your foot slip.
[50:08] Hallelujah. You'll find out then I need
[50:10] him every day.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because what the enemy is
[50:14] seeking whom he may devour, right?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, I
[50:20] say it's one thing about the devil. He
[50:22] don't care about neither side.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; The devil working on every side, ain't
[50:27] it?
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. The devil don't care about he
[50:30] he he get you. He gets your family. The
[50:32] devil, what his thing? Divide and the
[50:34] devil don't care about neither side,
[50:36] right?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't think that just you the
[50:39] devil just fighting them, but he ain't
[50:40] fighting you. Come on. then he already
[50:42] got you. The devil, he don't care about
[50:44] neither side, does he?
[50:45] &gt;&gt; But one thing about the love of God, it
[50:47] it it covers all. Hallelujah.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. But we find that I says, you
[50:52] know, come on, they departing from the
[50:54] living God. What it is? What it is? Uh
[50:57] uh I says, you know, people can think
[51:00] that they with God but not necessarily
[51:03] be with God.
[51:05] Y'all believe that tonight? People can
[51:07] think they right where they need to be,
[51:09] but then God shows up and show them that
[51:11] you ain't nowhere near where you need to
[51:13] be at.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I believe uh Paul, he might
[51:18] have thought that he was somebody, but
[51:19] then when he met that light, hallelujah,
[51:22] and it knocked him down, it showed him
[51:24] where he was at. He was fighting against
[51:25] the very thing that he thought that he
[51:27] was standing for. Right?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the light showed him,
[51:31] didn't it? Knocked him down, blind him,
[51:33] right? Hallelujah. brought about a
[51:36] humility in his life. And that's what I
[51:38] believe that the Holy Spirit has to do
[51:40] today. Come on, knock some of us down,
[51:43] right? Back to the place of that
[51:45] humility, right?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; The way we understand that it's God that
[51:49] gives us strength.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; It's God that set up. It ain't me, but
[51:52] it's the Lord. God know how to do that,
[51:54] don't he?
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But I says, God, I I pray you don't have
[51:57] to do that to me. I pray that I'll be
[51:59] able to walk all the time in humility.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, lest I forget. Yes, enemy.
[52:03] Hallelujah. Lest I forget. Hallelujah.
[52:06] The way that God made for me, this
[52:08] blood, his agony. I said, Lord, lead me
[52:10] to Calvary. Hallelujah. Take me back.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Somebody need to go back.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; The way they first believe. Hallelujah.
[52:20] When you first believe, you were in a
[52:22] place the way you didn't know whether
[52:23] you was going to make it tomorrow.
[52:25] Right? Come on. It's a simple thing. out
[52:27] of all that God was doing for them, the
[52:30] reason why they they they perished or
[52:32] they departed from the living God was
[52:34] because of unbelief.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Out of all of the miracles and the
[52:38] things, they they they lacked one thing.
[52:40] They couldn't uh uh uh they never
[52:42] learned how to grasp what simple faith
[52:45] was.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. out of all the things
[52:52] they lack,
[52:54] they couldn't grasp what simple faith
[52:56] was, right? They couldn't grasp how to
[52:59] take just what God said and just believe
[53:01] him just what he said. You know, when
[53:04] they got to the land, you know, and now
[53:06] it looks like they going to get ready to
[53:08] go over those spies come back and they
[53:10] all, oh, we can't do it. We
[53:11] grasshoppers. Then they begin to be mad
[53:13] with Moses, right? One of the things is
[53:17] I was I was looking at I says one one of
[53:20] the thing about the people they couldn't
[53:21] never get Moses out of their minds could
[53:23] they out of all the signs and the
[53:26] wonders and the things that God was
[53:27] doing through Moses but the thing about
[53:30] it was I don't believe Moses never
[53:33] pointed nobody to himself right but he
[53:36] was trying to get your faith to know
[53:38] that hey God is with you hallelujah
[53:41] &gt;&gt; and God is among you right
[53:43] &gt;&gt; and he'll fight against those that fight
[53:45] against you. He'll be an enemy to those
[53:47] that be an enemy to you. God loves you.
[53:49] You are his people. Right? Whatever you
[53:52] ask him for, ask him. Prove him. He'll
[53:54] give it to you.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; But it was all [screaming] leading you
[53:56] up to where you come to that place to
[53:59] where you say, "God, I believe you can
[54:01] do anything."
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I believe that all things are possible.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But they couldn't get them out of their
[54:08] minds. That's why every time something
[54:09] went wrong, they went to blaming him and
[54:11] getting upset and mad with him. Right?
[54:14] But you had two, I believe. Hallelujah.
[54:17] That the Bible says they were of a
[54:19] different spirit. Right?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. They had, even though they were
[54:22] in the in the camp, they had another
[54:24] spirit, didn't they?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; What spirit did they have? They had the
[54:28] spirit of God.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. They they was something and
[54:31] they were seeing, they was hearing, but
[54:34] it [screaming] went beyond what Moses
[54:36] was showing, right, or doing, but it
[54:38] went on to see the God that was back in
[54:41] Moses. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Hallelujah.
[54:45] I like how God told Joshua, he said,
[54:47] "Moses, my servant is dead now." Right?
[54:49] He says, "But as I was was with Moses,
[54:52] so shall I be with thee." Right?
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'll be with you. Signs and
[54:56] wonders, powers [screaming] through all
[54:57] the mistake, I'll be with you. But I
[54:59] want you to follow my word. And if you
[55:01] do, I'll be God to you. Hallelujah. Oh
[55:04] Jesus. I thank God that we got a God
[55:07] like that, right? He don't forsake his
[55:09] people, but he says, "I'll be with you
[55:11] even in you." Hallelujah.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. You'll prophesy again. Come on.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. How many believe that
[55:17] tonight? Come on. But that's what I I'm
[55:19] I I I I looked that says that what it
[55:22] is, you know, uh uh God God is always
[55:25] Come on. I say that he's always uh uh
[55:27] when he sends his his man or or God does
[55:30] something among amongst the people, it
[55:32] most of the time is misunderstood.
[55:35] Right? Come on. They depart like we say
[55:37] from the living God. One thing about it,
[55:40] you know, when when when Jo, not with
[55:42] Joseph, but when Jesus came on the
[55:43] scene, right, for him, John the Baptist
[55:45] shows up and they begin to ask John the
[55:48] Baptist because they knew the
[55:49] scriptures. The Pharisees and the
[55:50] scribes, they knew they knew the
[55:51] scriptures or the scrolls or whatever
[55:53] that day, they begin to ask him, "Are
[55:55] you the Messiah?" He says, "No, I'm the
[55:57] voice of one crying in the wilderness."
[55:59] Right? But even though they had the
[56:00] letter of the scriptures, they couldn't
[56:02] see it when it was living right there
[56:03] before them, could they?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when Jesus uh
[56:08] begin to show up, right? When Jesus
[56:09] showed up, begin to do the signs and
[56:11] wonders, they called him be elabub. I
[56:13] like how the even the people of uh that
[56:16] day they testified they that when Jesus
[56:18] was speaking, he was saying some of the
[56:21] same things that the that the scribes
[56:22] and the Pharisees been saying, but he
[56:25] says, "But he's speaking different from
[56:26] them." Hallelujah. Cuz he ain't just
[56:29] quoting it, but he's speaking like he
[56:30] got authority [screaming] behind it.
[56:32] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. What were they
[56:34] saying? He was making the word live.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; He's saying the same thing. But when he
[56:39] he speaks living something in my heart
[56:42] move. Hallelujah.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And I said that that's what it
[56:46] is today. You and I come on. As
[56:48] believers, what do you want? Come on. I
[56:51] want I want when when when I hear the
[56:53] word like they say something in my heart
[56:55] gets stirred. Something move on the
[56:57] inside. Right. You know that's why the
[56:59] devil don't want you to get near to
[57:00] life, right? He trembles at those things
[57:03] because he want to shake you. keep doing
[57:05] things, keep confusing, keep moving
[57:07] things among you. Keep your mind on
[57:08] this, keep your mind on that. Because if
[57:10] they ever get locked in, Hallelujah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; If they ever get in prayer, Hallelujah.
[57:17] and begin to hear God's voice, something
[57:19] to wake [screaming] up on the inside of
[57:20] them.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. So what does he want to do?
[57:25] Keep noise about, don't he? Come on.
[57:28] Keep things, you know, uh, shaking,
[57:30] moving like that. What, whatever. But I
[57:31] says, "Lord, no matter what, you know,
[57:33] it's a lot of noise out there." Come on.
[57:36] There's a lot of things out there to
[57:39] contend with, right? But I says, "Right
[57:42] now, Lord, I got to be locked in."
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. I got to be marking a perfect
[57:47] man, which is Christ, right?
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Keeping my eyes. How many want to keep
[57:51] their eyes on Christ tonight? But I says
[57:53] that what it is a lot of times we find
[57:56] that that I says that that you know uh
[57:58] through that through unbelief that's
[58:00] what it is. I says you know all of that
[58:02] what God was building them up to uh or
[58:05] was it was it get them just to grasp
[58:07] simple faith but they never could get it
[58:09] right. Come on. They never could get it.
[58:11] They always looked and to think things
[58:14] were way harder than what they were.
[58:16] Right. But I was thinking I says what it
[58:18] is. That's simple faith. One thing about
[58:20] Jesus, he he began to when he went down
[58:23] to uh Lazarus tomb and talking to
[58:25] Martha, he was saying that, you know, he
[58:27] that liveth and believeth in me, he'll
[58:29] never die. Right? But one of the things
[58:31] he he he said to her, he says,
[58:32] "Believest thou this?" Asking her, "Did
[58:35] she believe?" She said, "Yay, Lord, I
[58:36] believe." Hallelujah. Come on. I believe
[58:38] it. He said, "Then you'll see." You'll
[58:40] see the greater things. Right?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, God. That's what he wants. Do
[58:44] you believe? Hallelujah. Come on. If you
[58:47] believe it. I like how Mary says, she
[58:49] says, "How's it going to be? No man ever
[58:52] touched me." Right? But the angel begin
[58:54] to tell her the Holy Ghost was going to
[58:56] do it, right?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. It ain't in you. When you
[58:59] thinking about it, yes, you going to
[59:00] think you ain't able to do it, right?
[59:02] But one thing about it, you got to let
[59:04] the Holy Ghost do it. Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; It ain't in [screaming] me, but it's in
[59:07] him. God, he'll do it.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. She said, "Be it
[59:12] unto me according to thy word."
[59:14] Hallelujah. When you looking at the sick
[59:16] being healed, come on. Signs and
[59:18] wonders. What it is, it ain't you, but
[59:20] you looking to God to do it
[59:22] &gt;&gt; because [screaming] God told you he'll
[59:23] do it.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And then it's ain't in us, but it's in
[59:26] me saying, "Yes, Lord, I believe. Be it
[59:29] unto me." Hallelujah.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. And God will confirm it. One
[59:32] thing about it, God will confirm his
[59:34] word. Hallelujah.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Well, I was I was sharing uh I think
[59:37] yesterday, one thing about God, you
[59:39] can't be God-given. Hallelujah.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. You think that what you do God
[59:44] going to forget. Hallelujah. Come on.
[59:46] But when you when you do it out in the
[59:48] open and everybody know it. Come on.
[59:50] Then you already receive. God got no got
[59:52] no way to bless you. Right.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Because you already got it. Self
[59:55] glorification. But when you do things in
[59:58] secret. Hallelujah.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; He said in the word that I'll bless you
[1:00:01] what? Openly. Right.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. God's word can't fall to the
[1:00:05] ground. So many people want to be out
[1:00:07] like it said out there. But remember
[1:00:09] they got their reward. Hallelujah. But
[1:00:11] it's that one that's in secret praying,
[1:00:14] bringing down strongholds, standing in
[1:00:17] the gap. Hallelujah. God making a way.
[1:00:19] They might never get no recognition in
[1:00:21] this life, but they serve the purpose
[1:00:23] [screaming] that God put them here for.
[1:00:24] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And a lot of times
[1:00:27] they praying for you. How many believe
[1:00:28] that tonight? Somebody give the Lord a
[1:00:30] hand clap of praise. [applause] Amen.
[1:00:33] I said, what it is, you know, all those
[1:00:35] things what God God brings us to those
[1:00:38] places, right? Come on. to get us to
[1:00:40] believe, but it ain't far. And that's
[1:00:43] what the devil does. He comes with all
[1:00:45] kinds of things, right? When the when
[1:00:47] God, you know, probably God was talking
[1:00:49] about one time that when the Lord
[1:00:50] reveals something, come on. When the re
[1:00:53] real revelation comes, then here come
[1:00:54] the devil. He sends something too. Come
[1:00:57] on. To try to combat it, a spiritual war
[1:00:59] break out. Come on. And what it is want
[1:01:02] to get everybody. And the worst thing
[1:01:03] can be everybody now get super
[1:01:05] religious, don't they? Everybody got a
[1:01:08] word. Everybody. Come on. But one thing
[1:01:10] about it, like I said, no matter what
[1:01:12] what it is, God going to back it up,
[1:01:14] right? Ain't it? You wait around long
[1:01:16] enough. That's why I said, Lord, that I
[1:01:18] I don't have you don't have to go around
[1:01:20] proving this and that, but God God going
[1:01:22] to back it up. He going to do what he
[1:01:23] said.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that with all of my
[1:01:27] heart. That's why you you can have
[1:01:29] confidence not in yourself, but in
[1:01:31] Christ, right? When you out doing
[1:01:33] witnessing to those that all over the
[1:01:36] place, right? You can stand fast in
[1:01:38] faith. They can tell you all this and
[1:01:40] that or there, but it won't never shake
[1:01:41] you. Won't never move you because you
[1:01:44] know what your relationship is with
[1:01:45] Christ. You know what he did for you.
[1:01:47] Hallelujah. And you're standing solid as
[1:01:50] a rock. Nothing can't shake you. You
[1:01:52] know what the voice of God is, right?
[1:01:54] You heard that voice and you'll know it
[1:01:55] when you hear it again. Hallelujah. It
[1:01:58] might sound This might sound real, might
[1:01:59] sound, come on. But just something in
[1:02:01] your spirit say, "Mm, come on.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. That ain't right."
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. or something ain't right. But
[1:02:08] when the real when the voice comes,
[1:02:09] you'll stand up and you'll cover your
[1:02:11] face. Hallelujah. Go out and meet God
[1:02:13] because you know that's God right there.
[1:02:15] Hallelujah. The fire won't shake
[1:02:16] [screaming] you. The quakes won't shake
[1:02:18] you. But when that still small voice
[1:02:20] come, you'll know that voice.
[1:02:21] Hallelujah. I heard it once and I hear
[1:02:23] it again. Come on. How many believe that
[1:02:26] tonight? Oh Jesus. But what it is, come
[1:02:29] on. I said many times people did that.
[1:02:31] They departed. Come on. From the living
[1:02:34] God. God. Not not not that God didn't
[1:02:37] come down and do things. He did. But
[1:02:40] what what happens? What caused him? Come
[1:02:43] on. I says I says we got to get back to
[1:02:46] the living God, right?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; You got to get back. Hallelujah. To the
[1:02:51] to the real power, right? Real the life
[1:02:56] of the gospel.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; The life of it. The way you might not
[1:03:01] even understand all things, but you know
[1:03:03] one thing. You believe all things,
[1:03:05] right?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You believe it and God will confirm it,
[1:03:08] right?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't fully understand it, but
[1:03:10] to whom shall we go? Hallelujah.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I don't fully understand, but to whom
[1:03:14] shall we go? I know that you got the
[1:03:17] answer to my problems right now.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; I know that you can solve my situation
[1:03:21] that I'm in right now.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; I don't have all the Come on. But I know
[1:03:24] one [screaming] thing that you're able
[1:03:26] to solve my situation.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I know that you're able to intervene
[1:03:29] right now.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. on that woman that had that
[1:03:32] issue. She spent all her money from
[1:03:34] doctors. You got backed up in a corner
[1:03:36] to where she ain't had no other choice
[1:03:39] but to have simple faith. Right? That if
[1:03:42] I can touch the hem of his garment,
[1:03:44] right? Then I know what it is. God put
[1:03:46] her in that place the way she had no
[1:03:48] other choice but to believe.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And God does the same thing today. How
[1:03:52] many believe that backs us in corners?
[1:03:55] Come on.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. What he wants to show? He
[1:03:58] wants to show you that I'm alive and
[1:04:00] well. Hallelujah.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I'm still living today. I ain't dead. I
[1:04:03] ain't I'm not just the God of old, but
[1:04:05] I'm I am that I am. I'm right now. Come
[1:04:08] on. He Most time people take God, they
[1:04:11] put them on a shelf. Oh, he do this, he
[1:04:12] that. When they look at it and then then
[1:04:14] they put it so far away from them that
[1:04:16] they can't even reach out to it theirel,
[1:04:18] right? Because it's so many things in
[1:04:20] their way. But I want to say the word is
[1:04:23] even he's not you. Come on. God is not
[1:04:25] even. He's in your mouth. He ain't that
[1:04:27] far away. I said, "Don't put him on a
[1:04:29] shelf." Come on. But let him be in your
[1:04:31] heart. Hallelujah. That when all these
[1:04:33] things try to block your way. He's right
[1:04:36] there sitting in your heart. Hallelujah.
[1:04:38] Trying to block your way from your
[1:04:39] victory. Block your way from your peace.
[1:04:41] Block your way from your joy or your
[1:04:43] healing. Nevertheless, God [screaming]
[1:04:45] is in my heart. Where I walk, he's
[1:04:48] walking with me, directing my paths,
[1:04:50] [screaming] making a way. Oh, there's
[1:04:53] big mountains, but I got the mountain
[1:04:54] moving within me.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[1:04:58] mountains in the way,
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; but he is here living inside of me.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Wake up, brothers.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Wake up, sisters. Come on. It's a living
[1:05:06] God on your hands, right? [screaming]
[1:05:08] Believe us how it is.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's alive and well?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. When you know you
[1:05:16] serving a living God, you always have
[1:05:18] joy.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. Things catch you unaware, but
[1:05:22] then the joy joy bells ringing in my
[1:05:25] soul. Hallelujah. Why you got joy?
[1:05:27] Because I know that God is going to make
[1:05:29] a way. Though he slay me, yet I'll trust
[1:05:32] him. Right? And even if he don't show
[1:05:34] up, I still got faith to believe that
[1:05:37] God is going to make a way. He'll raise
[1:05:39] up the dead, won't he? Oh, Jesus. Come
[1:05:42] on. But that's what it's got to be. Come
[1:05:44] on. In your heart. How many believe that
[1:05:46] tonight? Come on. I'm stirred. I said
[1:05:48] what it is. Departing from the living
[1:05:50] God. One thing about Joshua and Caleb,
[1:05:53] different from the rest of them, they
[1:05:54] had a different spirit, didn't they?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. And you can see that today,
[1:05:59] it's a difference, right?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I know it to be the truth. It's a
[1:06:05] difference.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:10] [applause]
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said in the last days
[1:06:20] many are going to depart from the faith
[1:06:23] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:06:25] doctrines of devils or demons. Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But be thou steadfast unreovable
[1:06:34] always abounding in the work of the
[1:06:35] Lord. For as much as you know that your
[1:06:38] labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. It doesn't
[1:06:44] matter. Amen.
[1:06:47] If you know where you stand and you know
[1:06:49] whom you believe. Amen. You can trust in
[1:06:52] his unfailing word of promise that what
[1:06:55] God promised he's able to perform. So
[1:06:58] you can trust in that unfailing word of
[1:07:01] promise. Leaning on the everlasting
[1:07:04] arms. God. I know you do what you say.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I've already decided. Amen.
[1:07:11] I already made my choice.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] So, thank God we made our choice.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that we know that Jesus
[1:07:23] is the answer.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; No matter what the problem is, no matter
[1:07:26] what we're going through, he is the
[1:07:29] answer.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; So, we thank God for Jesus.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You love him tonight.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Appreciate.
[1:07:38] Praise God. The Lord, let us just bow
[1:07:40] for a moment. Father, in the precious
[1:07:42] name of Jesus, again, Lord, we thank you
[1:07:45] for precious brother Ernest, Lord, we
[1:07:48] thank you for the word tonight, Lord. We
[1:07:50] thank you for each and everyone that
[1:07:52] pressed their way out tonight.
[1:07:55] Lord God, and those that are listening
[1:07:56] in, Lord, Father, we especially pray for
[1:08:00] Brother Keith and Lord God, all the
[1:08:03] ministering brethren and Lord over in
[1:08:05] Jamaica. Lord, the thanks, Lord. And
[1:08:10] God, we lift them up tonight. And
[1:08:12] Father, we pray, God, that you continue
[1:08:14] to be with them and continue to supply
[1:08:17] every need according to your riches of
[1:08:20] glory where there's no way. Lord, you
[1:08:23] are more than able to make a way for
[1:08:25] your people. For in the precious name of
[1:08:28] Jesus Christ, Lord, we thank you. Bless
[1:08:32] your people tonight. Oh God, let
[1:08:35] somebody know, oh God, tonight that they
[1:08:38] can depend on you tonight. They can
[1:08:41] trust you, oh God, no matter what the
[1:08:43] situation is. Oh my God, won't you
[1:08:46] believe tonight? Won't you let God have
[1:08:49] the preeminence in your life tonight?
[1:08:52] Won't you ask him, God, that Lord, you
[1:08:54] said ask. Oh God, I don't know what it
[1:08:58] is. I don't know what you need, but if
[1:09:00] you're willing to ask,
[1:09:03] Lord, that my God is able to supply your
[1:09:05] needs.
[1:09:07] If you need salvation, ask,
[1:09:10] Lord, I want to receive it tonight. I
[1:09:13] know it's already been paid for. It's
[1:09:15] already done 2,000 years ago. But I want
[1:09:18] my portion.
[1:09:20] I want to receive you now, Jesus. I want
[1:09:23] you to come into my life. I want to be
[1:09:25] made over.
[1:09:28] trust in you. Now,
[1:09:30] somebody make an honest confession.
[1:09:32] Somebody
[1:09:34] repent of your sins and
[1:09:37] come to Jesus.
[1:09:39] It's up to you, brother, sister
[1:09:44] in Jesus name. We thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:09:47] you. Amen.
[1:09:49] want to tell you that brother Keith and
[1:09:53] the Saints said that's the worst storm
[1:09:57] Jamaica has had.
[1:10:00] But he says
[1:10:02] not one of the saints lost their lives.
[1:10:06] [applause]
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God we he said he'd
[1:10:15] get back with me. He's was trying to
[1:10:18] check and see whether the bank near him
[1:10:22] was able to
[1:10:24] we can send some funds to him and and he
[1:10:28] said you he would get back with me this
[1:10:31] afternoon but he wasn't able to get back
[1:10:34] with me this afternoon. So by the grace
[1:10:37] of God, we're going to be looking to
[1:10:40] hear from him and the saints over there.
[1:10:43] Said some people lo lost their pastor
[1:10:46] lost his house and everything and then
[1:10:50] some have lost the church roofs and
[1:10:54] different things that happened. Some was
[1:10:56] just some houses was you know there
[1:10:59] wasn't that they couldn't stand the
[1:11:01] storm so they were taken away. So,
[1:11:05] [music] and he says the roads were
[1:11:07] almost impossible to pass. So, you can't
[1:11:10] get from one place to another. People
[1:11:12] just stuck in the place they are at.
[1:11:16] So, I guess they're going to have to
[1:11:18] take helicopters or something. Said the
[1:11:21] most thing that they needed right now
[1:11:24] immediately is water and food.
[1:11:28] So, they he said that's the immediate
[1:11:30] need is water and food. He said most of
[1:11:33] the saints in his church, he said he
[1:11:36] went ahead and got those some supplies
[1:11:39] and all ahead of the storm coming. But
[1:11:44] some of them wasn't as fortunate as
[1:11:46] that. So by the grace of God, just pray
[1:11:49] for Jamaica and pray for not only the
[1:11:53] the bride of Jesus Christ there, but
[1:11:55] just pray for the people as a whole that
[1:11:58] God would be merciful to them and God
[1:12:01] would be with them. Anybody had a
[1:12:03] question or comment concerning
[1:12:06] Jamaica? Okay. Well, by the grace of
[1:12:09] God, we thank God for the word tonight.
[1:12:11] Thank God for you pressing your way
[1:12:13] tonight. And let's remember brother
[1:12:15] Jeremiah's meeting and he's got brother
[1:12:18] Wooley and
[1:12:21] I thank brother Solomon is brother
[1:12:23] Wooley in the morning and brother
[1:12:25] Solomon that night and
[1:12:30] he started tonight but we thank God for
[1:12:36] them them down there. So we're praying
[1:12:38] that God would bless those services. God
[1:12:42] be with you tonight. Let us stand.
[1:12:49] Praise God. Father, in the precious name
[1:12:52] of Jesus Christ, we thank you, Lord God,
[1:12:55] for your word tonight. We thank you for
[1:12:57] each and every one that pressed their
[1:12:59] way out tonight. I pray that you would
[1:13:02] watch over each and every family, each
[1:13:04] and every home. Thank you, Lord God. Not
[1:13:07] only is the floods and things hit New
[1:13:10] York City and our brother Carry on and
[1:13:13] sanks up there and Lord up in
[1:13:19] Lord upstate,
[1:13:21] Lord God in the east coast up in the
[1:13:26] north. Father, I pray God for them,
[1:13:29] Lord. I pray that you watch over them.
[1:13:32] And father we know that the floods and
[1:13:35] the storms are hidden everywhere. The
[1:13:37] earthquakes and different things Lord
[1:13:40] the condition where the people may not
[1:13:43] have food stamps and different things.
[1:13:45] And Lord we ask you in wrath remember
[1:13:48] mercy that chaos might not break out but
[1:13:52] Lord God that you would provide needs
[1:13:54] Lord and Father for your people Lord.
[1:13:59] And Lord God, we know the condition of
[1:14:01] the country and the nation. And we pray
[1:14:04] for those that are in authority. Lord,
[1:14:06] we pray that you guide them, Lord God,
[1:14:09] that they can come together with some
[1:14:11] type of solution, Father. Oh God, that
[1:14:14] so many people, oh God, jobs are in
[1:14:17] jeopardy, their lives are in jeopardy,
[1:14:19] the families, Lord. But Lord God, you're
[1:14:21] a merciful God. And we know you can fix
[1:14:24] things and you can work things out,
[1:14:26] Lord. And we ask you to do that God in
[1:14:29] the precious name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:14:31] thank you Lord as we leave this place
[1:14:33] with not your presence. Go with your
[1:14:35] people in Jesus' name. Amen.
