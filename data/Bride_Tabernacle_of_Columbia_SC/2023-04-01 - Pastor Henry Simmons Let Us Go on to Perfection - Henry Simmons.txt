pressure We Are Tonight God is good amen let's just we thank God for the holidays coming up and it we want to have communion next Friday in feet washing I've noticed feet communion and feet Watching Next Friday and let's just try to find us and pray next week Monday through Friday and um let's pray for it it's coming a time where we're going to have to move into more proud more fasting if we want to see God move amen so by the grace of God we're going to have to step it up and gonna have to give God more are you with me so by the grace of God we thank the Lord for brother Palmer we went down to um Atlanta area and picked up a tent so hopefully we'll let we'll have a tent meeting the same time that we usually have it last weekend in July like Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday of July the last week for July and we'll try to get the Flyers out soon so by the grace of God we thank God for brother Paul whatever's being on the lookout and God bless him to get somebody that he knew that knew somebody amen so by the grace of God we appreciate your prayers concerning intent let's just keep praying and those that on the prayer list always remember them it's just so much is going on so fast and seems like it's so much to be done and I'm trying to do as much as I can do and uh I want you to try to do as much as you can do in the kingdom of God Amen we having good Fellowship not in Sumter just pray for the Saints death let us just stand tonight okay let us your smile father we thank you Lord God for just blessing us tonight to come together in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord you paid the price and we thank you for paying the price dying for our sins and and father God forgiven us oh God for all our shortcomings my Lord may you bless your word may you bless every heart that have come God may you strengthen your people Lord those that desire to be here that couldn't make it those that have made it Lord I pray God that you speak a word in season in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hebrews 6 in a world where it's so much confusion and chaos the prophet speaker spoke a message be certain of God and I I said we need to be certain we don't need to be done at this particular hour so as we were speaking on adoption and uh we continued on with that but we talk about let us go on to perfection it's time to go on it's time to stop going around in circles it's time to get a hold of God in a real way in a way where we're getting results in our lives where God is getting to be more real to us and we feel ourselves growing and getting closer to him so it's time for us to get up the lungs of our mind and and go on let's just not stand still let's go on because I know sometimes there's things that can hinder you things that could uh stop you and startle you trip you and things that can cause you to not move forward but let us go on he says here therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not land again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith towards God and of the doctrine of baptism and of the land on our hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this is what we do if God permits God bless you I'm not going to get into the next versions I thought it was impossible for those that once enlightened amen and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and we're partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the power of the world to come if they shall fall away if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the son of God afresh and put him to open shame so by the grace of God we want to just deal with that first verse let us go on to perfection because like I say it's things that come before us and things that hinder and start the growth of the people of God so oftentimes we try to go forward but we're stunted in our growth because the enemy is there to hinder you to resist you to try to keep you from moving forward now Hebrews 2 and nine it says but we see Jesus who was made a little Lord and angels for the suffering of death crying with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man I want you to look at Jesus and what he did to us for us for in the temporary it became him for whom are all things and by whom all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation what perfect the temp first perfect through what suffering we talk about let's go into Perfection we want to be perfect our desires to be perfect and in this age that the prophet spoke on the Statue of a perfect man and we know Hebrews I mean Matthew tells us to be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect now God is not looking for a church with excuses he's looking for perfection he said let us go on to perfection now the revelation of the word and the opening of The Seven Seals and God sent in a prophet to come down not for us to stay in our nomination of thoughts and our ideas but to go into the land to lead us Cross Jordan when we come out of mystery Babylon God wants us to go on not just to come out but to go in go into the promises go into the blessings so the prophet was to come to introduce us to the revealed word of the hour to Jesus Christ the word that God wanted us to manifest for our day we live in everybody else was in people in other ages God went that ignorance but now he's calling every man everywhere to come to a repentance so we have clarification on the word amen we're not to add to the word we're not to take away from the word praise God but God's holding us accountable we're gonna be accountable for much giving as much required God wants us to go on to Perfection there's no excuses now I think that there's more excuses in it and those that call themselves The Bride than in any other people with all the word and the church being set in order for rapture Rapture in faith Faith come by here and here and by the word of God by faith in Egypt was what translated isn't that right and faith is a revelation amen so you must have a revelation on what God is requiring for the day you live in praise God if you're living in no day you had a revelation that you built you got it going on he was with Moses the Revelation you had to put the blood on the doorpost in land you didn't do it deaf Angel gonna get isn't that right but failed to recognize it in the days of uh Paul didn't recognize Peter and the rest of the Apostles he was Saul of Natasha's persecuting the church but God had shined the light amen when you're trying to live under the law God doesn't move down in other words he said Paul come on you got to go into perfection amen praise God in the days of Paul and then in days of Iranians and days of Martin in Columbus so forth we had to keep going you couldn't stand still said in Luther with justification you had to go on the sanctification you got to go on you got to keep moving and when the Holy Ghost came down and the restoration of the gifts there was still another stage of Grace God wants you to go on to Perfection you got it going on in the perfect word are you with me the light is shining brighter you can't stop there's no stopping brother sister amen because you're walking into a manifestation of the sons of God you're walking into your translation are you up man you can't stop until you get out of here you got to walk like in it walk because it was a seventh from Adam you in the seventh Church age you stepped out of the seventh and today this is a new day are you up man let us go on amen Love's gone praise God stop standing still let's go on praise God we got to keep moving praise God you can't stand still amen from glory to the glory he's what changing me amen hallelujah God is looking for a perfect perfection not excuses not excuses well Lord you understand ah no no excuses I know we got a lot of excuses are not walking like we are to walking living like we ought to live but there's no excuses God has given us a word not only did he give us the word but he gave us his Spirit to anoint the word and cause the word to come to life are you with me praise God so we're gonna we have no excuses Hebrews five brothers and sister we it's it's time now to go on praise God let's go on praise God let's go on praise God stop standing still let's go on go on to Perfection amen this word didn't come in this hour for us to stand still and you'll say thank you Lord and we got the word amen the evening time the evening light has come on not to clap your hand and Shout let's go on praise God if all it took is going over the Red Sea they can shine and dance and have a Revival but the Red Sea was not the Promised Land are you up man praise God Amen you come out but you didn't go in yet praise God let's go on praise God even when you go on then the position the place you've got to know what part of the body you are praise God Amen we're not in the footage praise God hallelujah praise God you got to know what where you are I said this is the intelligent this is the mind of God praise God we are saved we have had a seal amen praise God but we are here back amen we're in Spoken Word season isn't that right praise God where is it deity amen the prophet said this is not in heaven but deity is where it's in you are you with me God Amen was in Christ with God Christ is in Christ is in you is the what hope of glory what is he saying amen dear to being in you amen God in you is the same God that created the heavenly are you with me but you got to recognize that God that's in you what the holy who the Holy Ghost is and the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ but you cannot amen use what you got until you get understanding amen and all by getting let's go on we got to grow up we don't never grow up we'll never be able to exercise our senses praise God I fight in Hebrews 5 and 12. you see Hebrews 5 and 12. from when for the time ye ought to be what teachers are you with me you have need that what one teach you again which be the first what of the ours is gone leaving the principles of the doctrine let us go on to perfection in

problem with the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life you're trying to get them to overcome this world trying to get them to come out from among them and be separate they're still holding on to the world of things can't get them to dress right can't get them to live right can't get them to do right they're more interested in Wireless stuff than they're interested in the things
