if you have your Bibles this morning we ask you turn to the book of Acts chapter n amen amen when you got it say amen amen amen and it reads and it reads and Saul yet breathing out threatening and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letter us to Damascus to the synagogue that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women and he might bring them bound to Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there Shine from Heaven round about him a light from heaven and he fell in to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest and if it and it and it is hard for thee to kick against the prick and he trembled astonished and said Lord what would thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do amen may God bless the reading those word you may be seated amen this morning I'd like to speak on a small of the topic that I entitled a finished work or a complete work amen and I looked at the I looked at the scripture with Paul and I wanted to come down a little bit further um in verse 17 and it says and ananas went his way and entered into the house and put his hands on him saying brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way that thou camest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forth with and arose and was baptized and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saw certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus and straight way he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God but all that heard him were amazed and and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem it came hither for the intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priest but Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt in Damascus proving that this is very Christ amen and I was looking at the story of Saul this morning now and I like I said I entitled it a complete work and I said when saw when he met Jesus on the road to Damascus his life changed it was a change from night and like night and day to even they said when in verse 21 they said that when the people heard him they were amazed they were astonished at what God had done in his life they were astonished at the transformation that had happened in his life and see they they understood that something was different but some didn't want to believe it they didn't want to see it they didn't want to believe it because because they couldn't believe of what had happened they went from one day seeing a man go out and kill people because they professed the name of Jesus they seen one day a man go out and he reached out and he was going against these people and yet he turns around and a few weeks later is preaching the same thing and they said how can this be but they didn't understand that he had had a visitation with Jesus he had met Jesus along the way and his life was changed and see God had done a complete work in his life he had done a completed work that when people looked at him they knew it was nothing but God it was nothing but him that had come down and changed his life had changed his life for the better had done a complete work in his life and Saul was just he was what it was such a complete word that God changed his name he said I can't call you by what you used to be he said I got to change your name I got to give you a new name he had to give him a new name because he had a work for him to do he had something that he wanted Paul to do he had something that Paul had and no matter what his life looked like before God had changed his life God had done a complete reworking of his life and made him into who he wanted him to be and I was reading something and I said but and it says but the thing of it is is having nothing that you can depend on in your own self or anything that you can do just a complete total surrender of your weakness is unto God and say here am I have nothing or or no ability that you can trust in see God wants you to come to him and say Lord I I can't do nothing all that I have learned all that I have attained is nothing Lord I want you to do a complete work in my life that Lord my life every day when I live every day when I wake up every day when I go around those that are around me they can testify and prove that you are God it can prove that you you are the one that can change things Lord you they may have seen me yesterday but that's not today they may have seen me last night but that's not today cuz God can do a complete work in my life and make sure that everything that I do can testify of him see Paul had that testimony he said I've been to the best of the best I've learned under the best of the best but I count it all not I count it as nothing that I have done because I have not attained anything it's only because of the grace of God and the mercy of God on my life that I can even sit here and testify that God is good and said God said that he wanted to be a savior but he had to let some people be lost he had to give you the opportunity to choose him and today we all had the opportunity to choose him and say Lord I want you to do a complete work in my life I want you to do a work and finish this work in my life and I was looking back through the scripture and I was thinking about many many stories that I that I want to point to and just for a short time this morning and ask if you turn in your Bible to 1 Samuel 1st Samuel chapter 17 I thought of a very familiar scripture and you may you may know it and you may have read it many times but I want to look at the latter part of the scripture said there was a man in 1 Samuel and his name was David and David he had went out and David was a little little Ruddy boy they said and he had went out and he was a sheep herder and nobody looked at David as anything special the only one that knew that he was special was God he knew that what was in him was going to come out one day but he had to go into the sheep field to learn the lessons that God was going to prepare him for and then you looked at the story and David killed a lion and he killed the bear and God was building up a testimony God was doing a work in David's life God was doing a special work in his life but when David came and he came into he had a test one day he went to his brothers his brothers was fighting was fighting the enemy and the enemy had a champion and the champion's name was Goliath and Goliath was bigger than everybody stronger than everybody and was a Warrior from his Youth and nobody wanted to fight Goliath cuz they thought for sure that they will get killed and sometimes if you are afraid of your enemy you will be destroyed if you are afraid of what's coming against you you will lose that fight not because you're not able and God's not able to do it it's because you're afraid that he won't do it you have doubt in your heart but you got to come with faith but when there was nobody in that camp that had faith that they could defeat the Goliath but one day David he came and he brought some supplies to his brothers and he came out of there and he he realized he he heard Goliath boasting in front of them and basically like y' y'all don't have nobody that can fight me y'all just weak to paraphrase it y'all ain't got nobody and so he came he came and David heard him and it's like what are y'all doing he he looked at his brother like what are y'all doing isn't this the same God that brought us out of Egypt isn't this the same God that delivered Jericho to us isn't this the same God that did so many wonderful things before us and we can't trust him to defeat this enemy see David had seen that God can deliver him from a bear David has seen that God can deliver him from the a lion and David said what is this this is nothing there's nothing too big for my God there's nothing that God can't do for me because he has seen God work he has seen God do these things and David heard heard this Goliath he said man I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to attack this go this Goliath and when and David said and said and David he went out out and he went to Saul and Saul was like well if you want to go fight him let's protect you let's put you on some armor let's put you on but David realized what they were putting on wasn't what he used to fight the enemy he he realized this this just going to weigh me down this ain't helping me cuz this ain't how God delivered me before he realized that God ain't have to use all this to deliver me God didn't have to use armor and protection to deliver me he just wanted me to walk out on faith he just wanted me to go out and trust him and say God you're the same God that can deliver me before you'll deliver me again and David he got out there and he went to he went to he went out there and he grabbed his five stones out of the brook and he he got out there and in verse 41 and it reads and the Philistine came on and Drew near unto David and the man that bear The Shield went before him and I I just explained that there there David Goliath was so big that he had someone to carry his shield for him he was so big that he The Shield was so big that he had someone else to carry it for him in verse 42 and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him and for he was but a youth and Ruddy and of a fair countenance and the Philistine said unto David am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his Gods excuse me and the Philistines said unto said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fouls of the air and to the beasts of the field then David said to the Philistine thou comest to me with the sword and with the spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied see David wasn't worried about what goliath believed in he wasn't worried about all the gods that Goliath cursed him out in he wasn't worried about that cuz he said I come in the name of the Lord of hosts he knew the God that he served and he knew what he was capable of doing in verse 46 this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand see David didn't even have to fight the battle to know that he was going to have the victory he didn't even have to fight the battle he already knew that God was going to deliver Goliath into his hand and he said and I will smite thee David wasn't worried about anybody else he he was telling Goliath exactly what was going to happen to him because he knew what God can do and and and he said I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fouls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel see David had to show them that my God is real I don't know who you believe or who you serve but my God is real and he he was so careful he didn't even tell him what was going to happen to Goliath he told him to all Goliath friends he said all y'all going to die too said I'm going to tell y'all when God does thing he completes it he does an other works in your life he makes sure that he doesn't just destroy the the biggest thing he destroys all the friends that come along with you he destroys everything that comes against you he said that my God is real and God will complete the work and said that and that the all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel now David could look back at them and said do y'all not trust the god that you serve because the God that I serve can do Mighty things he said there's nothing that can stand in front of him and I'll skip down to verse 48 and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and Drew not of David that David hasted and ran towards the army of the to meet the Philistine see David he got going into the battle when the battle started David wasn't even afraid he started running towards this Philistine and verse 49 and David put his hands in his bag and took then of stone and slang it and smoked the Philistine in the forehead that the stone stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the Earth so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smok the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David David all he had was a stone and a sling and this Philistine had all the armor the newest things the greatest protection that he probably could have because he was a warrior since his Youth and and David all he had was just a sling in a stone and a belief in God that God can do anything that that that that was was more greater than he was able to do David wasn't strong enough he wasn't big enough but one thing David trusted God and he wasn't afraid those were the two things that David had and said in verse 51 therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine took his sore and Drew it out and cut off and sheath there and slew him and cut off his head there with and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead they fled see all you to do is trust God to defeat your enemy and when that happens the ones that around you will flee because they just look it up and say as long as he got you we good we good as long as you fighting that we good as long as you working with that but when God comes and he does a complete work all the other ones will flee and 52 and he said and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistine see the men of Israel had something to shout about now they they had something to give joy about cuz they realized that the god that they sered was still the same God he was still the one that brought them out of egyp he was still the one that raised from the dead he was still the one that can do mightiest work and they shouted and pursued the Philistines till they came into the valley and the gates of eon and the wounded Philistines fled fell down by the way of sharum and even unto G unto Eon see everything that David told Goliath was going to happen happen exactly how he said not because David was great not because David was strong not because David was mighty but because David trusted God David had such a great faith in God that he said I I can speak this and I believe it will be so I can speak this and I believe that my enemy will be defeated I can speak this and I believe that these things will happen just like I say they will because I trust God to do it I trust God that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God that can move mountains he's the same God that when you speak to the sun the sun will stop he's the same God that left the sun to stop so that Joshua could defeat the rest of his enemies he said Lord the Sun is going down I I'm not finished destroying the rest of my enemies cuz God when he does something he does it completely he finishes thing he does just leave it halfway he wants to make sure that you have utterly and total Deliverance over whatever may be in your path and David was just an example of this and I I said that I had another example when I thought about the story of Abraham and I said when God blesses you He blesses you completely as well he doesn't just do it only bless part he doesn't in hold see when God came to Abraham and he a and and he said I'm going to give you a son he he came and he came to Abraham and he said Sarah laughed and I I had one thing that I I wanted to read because it stood out to me in Genesis chapter 22 Genesis chapter 22 I think I got the wrong scripture actually Genesis Chapter 18 and chapter 18 and verse 14 verse 13 I'll start in verse 13 and the and and God told Abraham and Sarah they were going to to have a child but Abraham and Sarah they said that we're old and Sarah laughed at the word of the Lord that they were going to have a child because the time had passed for for her and childbearing and the Lord said uh and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assurity bear a child which am old and is and verse 14 says and this is what I wanted to point out say is anything too hard for the Lord he asked him is anything too hard for the Lord said at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and see even in verse 15 it shows that then Sarah denied saying I laugh not cuz Sarah was embarrassed because when God says something he does it when God says I'm going to do a thing he's going to do it exactly how he said he was going to do it he said at the time appointed these things shall happen he didn't tell him when exactly it was going to happen but he said it shall happen because he spoke the word so you can hold on to that word and know that God will complete exactly what he said he would do and and it said in verse if any is there anything too hard for the Lord and I'm here this morning to let you know that there's nothing too hard for God there's nothing that he cannot do for for you there's no battle That's too great for him because he's done so many things and he said if you trust in him as the song writer said song writer said if I trust in him and never doubt he will surely bring me out said God is that good and that gracious and that merciful that I can look at him and I can and I said that I think about how that in the beginning God created everything he created everything and when he got done he said this is very good because God knew that he was the only one that could create he's the only one that can do these things you see God did and when he created everything from the very beginning he didn't leave nothing out he didn't Overlook anything he made sure that all things would work in Harmony and when he finished the work he gave man Domin dominion over it see God when he does a thing he does it completely God didn't Overlook anything he made sure he said that he was the beginning and the end so God knew from the very beginning what the end was going to be and he could create the beginning to make sure the end ended a certain way because he's God he's the god that's always there he's the god that always has been there he's a God that always will be there because he's God there's nothing too big and too hard for him because he's God and if I if you look back and say what what has the Lord even in your own life what has the Lord done for me what has the Lord done for me when I looked and I said that things were impossible and he still made the impossible possible because he's God and when he does something he completes it if he says by his strikes I am healed I can hold on to that because he's God and I can look at when he went to calvalry he defeated everything that was before he defeated every devil that may come up against you because he's God and he said I'm going to finish this it says in in John it says when Jesus was on the cross and he came to the end of the road he stretched out and he said it is finished it was right then and there the devil had no Dominion he had no control over anything else because what was going on everything that was there before was finished cuz God had done a complete work he had given us a way to get back to Heaven he had given us a way and given us an opportunity that said because I shed my blood I'm going to take your place I'm going to make sure that you have a way of Escape I'm going to make sure that you have a way to come to me and he said come to me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for and he said that he would make your burdens e easy and your burdens light amen he make the Yoke easy in your burdens light amen see God he wants to take your burdens he wants to take what you've been going through and said I know that you can't defeat it that's why I gave it to you so that you can learn to trust me I gave this to you so that I can prove that I'm a deliverer I gave this to you so I can prove that I'm a Healer I gave this to you so I can prove that I'm a provider I gave this to you that you can come back and say I understood what David was saying recently Lord if I had 10,000 tongues I couldn't praise you enough because God had been been that good to him God had done a complete work in David's life and when he looked back over his life he said you know God been too good to me God has been too good to me and when God starts something he completes it when God starts something he finishes it he's not a runner that starts a race and gets tired and say you know what I'm done I quit that's not God God when he starts the race when you when he gives you the race that he gives you he make sure that he gives you the strength he said I will supply all your needs I will make sure that I give you the strength that when you get tired I'm going to give you something to encourage you I'm going to give you something that's going to uplift you I'm going to give you something that's going to propel you forward and say and remind you that I'm still here with you I'm still God and I can change things in the moment in the twinkle of an eye I can make things disappear I can make things reappear I can make all that's going against you be a blessing for you so sometimes we look at our struggles and our trials and say man this this is hard for me but when you look back and said you know everything that was hard was just a lesson that God was trying to teach me it was just something that was a blessing even though even while I was stressing it was still a blessing because I would not be the one that I am today if God didn't start this work and complete it I would not be where I am today if I hadn't gone through what God had allowed me to go through because when God starts something he never leaves you confidence he never leaves you by yourself he never leaves you going through and continue to struggle he as long as you keep your eyes on him I said there was a story in the Bible where the disciples they had went out at night and I think the Book of John and they had went out and they were fishing all night and they were fishing and they were fishing and they couldn't catch anything now imagine if your livelihood the thing that you were good at the thing that you were great at all of a sudden you're no longer great at it you got to think about it Simon and those they were fishermen in all their lives they have been fishermen so you would think they know where to catch fish they know how to catch fish they know where to go and what time and what season to catch fish you don't go at certain Seasons because of the different things that and there's some that could tell you better than me but there are certain times when you go fishing and you expect to catch fish see they went out and they was expecting to catch something and they had they had fished all night long they had toiled all night long they might have moved from this spot to this spot to this spot and they were looking for some fish but they couldn't find nothing and when they got done and then Jesus came and they didn't know it was him and he said hey cast your nets on the other side now mind you if you was in that boat would you have listened would you have said you know what we've been doing this all our lives we don't even know who that is and they saying cast your net on the other side of the boat now now you don't think we tried that you can imagine what they might have thought but you know what someone might have said you know what let's just try it let's just see what happens and you know and and in the scripture said he said cast your net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find and they cast therefore and John chapter 21 and6 and he said they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw in for the multitude of fish see they were not able to draw in because God when he starts something he completes it and they said and that that's when they recognized that it wasn't just someone on that on that Shore it was Jesus it was Jesus it was the one that had been there with him the one that can speak things into existence whenever he wanted to and said when they got done and they counted it up it said it was 153 fish in that in that net and it was a small boat but they said the thing about it was with all the fish that was in it all types of fish the net never broke because when God does something he doesn't allow you to just if one blessing comes he wants you to get all the blessings everything that he has bestowed on you he wants you to capture it all he want to make sure that you get everything that he has for you he want to make sure that when I do this work you going to I'm going to complete it not you I think of how when God said he was going to destroy the Earth he destroyed everything he didn't leave nothing out but Noah who he said I was going to provide a way for you he said build this because I'm going to provide a way for you and God destroyed everything that the world was no longer like it was before because God when he does something he does a complete work he does something and he changes it in such a way that you know it was God that you can look back and say I know because of where I've been and what I've done Lord I know that it's only you that brought me out I know that what I was going through and where I was might have been in the bed of Affliction you might have been going through hard things in life but when I came to you Jesus I realize that Lord I was forever changed I realize that God you was you can do a work that nobody can do you can do a work in such a way that God that you can change my life no matter what I face no matter what I go through no matter what may be attacking me no matter what I may look at no matter who's around me God you can do this work said when I come to him I said the only thing that stops you is that you got to give a total surrender you got to give a total surrender to God that said Lord I want you to do the work I said there's a saying that says the Lord will keep you but I heard someone say if only if you want to be kept see you got to want God to do a change in a work in your life you got to want the Lord to change you you got to want the Lord to do a special work in your life and said Lord I give you everything Lord I can stand up and say Lord I trust you see David got before Goliath and he knew that Lord I trust you I can run towards my enemy because my enemy is going to be my foot stol today I can run towards my enemy because I know that God you're going to deliver him into my hand Lord I can run towards my enemy because I know when I get there you're already going to perform the work Lord I can run towards my enemy because I'm no longer afraid because I know that you're behind me Lord Lord I can run towards my enemy because I know there's nothing nothing too hard for you Lord I can run towards my enemy because I know that all things are possible if I only believe Lord you're the one that can do the work and there nothing that I can do there's no reason that I can point to myself and say that I did this my only thing I can do is point to you I can look up and say Lord my Help Cometh From The Lord my help and my strength and my Lord everything that I have each and every day that I wake up every breath that I breathe it comes from the Lord and I can look up and say Lord if you can give me life to breathe I know that you can keep me I know that you can direct me Lord I know that you can guide me Lord I know that you can watch over me Lord I know that you can bless me Lord I know that you can heal me Lord I know that you can deliver me Lord I know that you can save me because you're God and there's nothing too hard for you cuz when God does a thing he finishes it he completes it and he leaves nothing to nothing to to chance because he's God he said I know your beginning and I know your ending amen he knew when you started he knew all the ups and downs that you were going to go through he knew that when you got to certain points and places you was going to have no one to turn to but God and he said I had to give you that so that you could trust me more said I can't give you more if you if you're not using what I already gave you I can't give you more cuz God God wants to do a complete work he he does nothing halfway if God builds something he said I can imagine the best reward that you can ever get I said I started thinking the other day I said you know some people look to retire but I said there's no retirement like heaven there's no retirement when you get over there you don't have to worry about trying to find a house when you get over there you got a mansion and when you step out your door you're walking on Street streets of gold said when God does something he does it so spectacular that even you can't imagine it when he does something he does it so mighti full that even you couldn't even fathom it you didn't understand how God was going to do it but he did it you didn't understand how it was going to happen but he did it and he did it and said I sometimes I just want to prove to you that I'm God I remember the story in the Bible there was a blind man and the fa and God when he healed him the Jews they came back to him and they asked him or people asked him was it because of his parents' sin well that he was blind all his life and then then they as and Jesus said no was it because of his sin they asked and Jesus said no and and to paraphrase it and when he got down to it he said the reason that he was blind so that one day I could get Glory God allows certain things to happen so that he can get Glory so that he can say the work that I started was always going to be completed I just had to wait and let you go through so that I can complete the work so that I can show you that it's not anything that you could do it's not anything that you could say it's not anyone around you that can do it but I am God and I change not and I will do exactly what I said I would do amen at this time let us all
