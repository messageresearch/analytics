read the 15 together God is good amen saying on Thursday night we must apply the blood and amen the movies they're preaching the funeral the other day we were talking about them the blood of Jesus Amen so this morning we won to talk about the Power in the Blood the power of the blood of Jesus amen the Hebrews 9 and 1 then verily the first Covenant had also audience of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary too and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holy of all four and over it the cherubims of Glory shouting The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly six but unto the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the error of the people eight which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscious ten but Christ's been come and high Priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hand that is to say not of this building 12. for if the blood bulls and goats and the ashes of the help of spranking the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh 14. together for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance God bless you towards you may be seated there's power in the blood or the power of the blood of Jesus Amen that's Power in the Blood amen it's probably too loud a little time there's power in the blood amen so we thank God this morning because you know I I just praying and just brought tears to my eyes that there's so many things I said the prophet of God said we can bring the people to the church and we can bring them to a system or Wicked but he said I'm afraid that the people are not being bought to Jesus Christ and you know sometimes we bring them to the message we bring them to the church we bring them to that but the people are not being bought to Christ and um the reason why because there's only way one way we could be bought to Christ amen he said in Romans 5 by one man sent in it in the world and by one man amen God made a way that we can be come back to God and that's the man Jesus Christ do one man sin and do one man die God made a way that you you and I could come back be reconciled back to God if by one man can condemnation set in then one man is the free gift amen and that's the gift of eternal life and he talks about any in Eternal in the 15th verse he said the promise of an eternal inheritance that really struck me amen the Eternal inheritance and he said we have Redemption amen we have been redeemed so let me just I I was all excited I've been excited about the blood of Jesus Christ and been excited about because we we make the blood Sometimes some not effect because we esteem other things greater than the blood of Jesus and not seeing the pathway in which amen Jesus came to the Earth to make a way that we can get back to God and all in types and shadows that was showing from the beginning amen that through the blood of bulls and goats and Ash over the half heifer and the Tabernacle itself was saying this is the way back to God but in that Tabernacle that Moses built and it had you know the ark and so forth and different things that was in there the furnitures and all it was showing us the pathway and we know that through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was showing typing out but seeing that it took a blood sacrifice at the altar altar without the blood sacrifice that even God was not real please and when the high priest went into the holy of Holiness once a year into that Tabernacle he couldn't go in there without blood but he had to offer for himself and for the sins of the people he had to offer blood sacrifice of a lamb and that lamb had to be without spot oh it could not be or lane or whatever Hawk it had to be without spot it had to be perfect are you with me and it was for their sins to be covered but the conscious was still there the conscience of sin it could not take that nature away they still had the same desires they couldn't say well you know but I I don't I I don't desire that no more they were just covering in me it discovered the sins couldn't take away sins the conscious still was he still felt condemned unconscious still felt like a sinner and because you felt like a sinner in your conscience and you know some folks because they don't recognize what the blood of Jesus Christ has done a lot of folks come to church and and it's supposed to be Christians but they they're walking around in condemnation they feel condemned they're conscience because the devil is already always bringing out what you're doing and seemeth though people are not able to grasp their Deliverance they're not able to comprehend what the blood has achieved and accomplished for them so them not really recognizing the power of the blood and what Jesus died and what he did in that he died it wasn't just that he died it was the power in which God Amen the power of that blood the power of the death of Jesus Christ it was so powerful it did something not only did it do something about our sins but it did something amen about the conscience that we had the desire to sin when we could not overcome things see because we had to face the fight that do I come to church and do I feel like I'm a part of Brian Tabernacle of this church at that church have we come to uh recognize the power of the blood and what the blood has achieved and accomplished for you and I and sometimes I feel like we haven't fully uh comprehended that and because of a lack of understanding the devil will still have you bound twisted up tied up and Tangled Up mixed up in messed up but once you recognize the power of the blood and what the blood has achieved for you things would be different that's why Paul says there is there for now no condemnation to them that are what in Christ Jesus who walked not after the what oh God see you're gonna constantly feel condemned when you do not recognize your Eternal inheritance if you do not recognize the power of the blood and what he achieved and accomplished for you you will still walk with your head down you said I accept that Jesus Christ as my person the Savior yes but you don't really know what accepting Jesus Christ is savior what it really means what it really entails what does it really mean to accept Jesus Christ what is it what does it really mean to confess Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead if you do not understand the magnitude of what has been achieved for you we merely can go through the motion and not get what we're supposed to get because we don't understand what has really transpired but when we recognize what transpired that day on Calvary praise God let's just go to Acts 2 for a moment uh to and 22. Peter talked about on the day of Pentecost standing up with 11 and telling them these men are not drunk as you suppose when the Holy Ghost was pulled out there was there were misunderst they didn't understand what this Holy Ghost was all about they thought it was new wine they met but Peter standing up says these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is not which is spoken of by the prophet Joy that in the last days say to God I promise Spirit upon All Flesh amen see the Holy Ghost being poured out was a representation amen and it was Amen to signify and to demonstrate and to manifest that what Jesus has accomplished Amen on the cross and what he died for amen it truly has been Vindicated amen your faith in him has been uh Vindicated praise God you just didn't accept Jesus but God has come down to affirm and to reaffirm to you that your faith has been accepted are you with me so brothers and sisters amen God gives you confirmation and constellation are you up there so God wants you to walk with amen with coughing in your heart and a constellation that Jesus has achieved a great team for you and I amen we don't have to amen one writer said we'll no more fondness amen and strangers with no more alienated there amen but we have come to the blood of Jesus Christ amen as not strange as the foreigners but we have come to be a fellow citizens of the kingdom of God amen we become amen Jordan is with God in Christ amen we've come to be Sons and Daughters of God by faith in the blood amen by what he's achieved for you and I the magnitude of it amen your mind cannot comprehend in this fullness only thing is amen we just amen even understanding part he meant the magnitude of what has taken place on Calvary amen the devil has taken men and he is so tormented our souls and amen he's made us amen slaves to uh bondage to corruption and things that amen have no amen uh uh joy and peace and we've become slaves to sin not by our own will and our own wants it was because of Adam's sin and because of Adam's sin all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but the last item which was Christ amen he came to paint the price amen praise God He Paid a Debt he did not owe amen praise God he came and he paid uh the price for you and I thought you and I might not have to pay that debt are you a man but if somebody paid the debt that you owe amen you ought to say thank you for painting you ought to say thank you amen if you're old for your car your house and different things amen your credit card and somebody came and paid it all off you said Thank You Hallelujah somebody sometimes you hold two or three hundred thousand dollars on your house they owe uh uh twenty thousand dollars on your car somebody come and pay your house off and pay your call and all your credit offer amen and then you say wow you Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord somebody came and said well uh your house is paid off your car is paid off and all your debts have been taken care Hallelujah hey I can get a shot in the gas then somebody said if I had never shot it before I could shop now praise God hallelujah because all my my house my car everything we know everything you're all depending on nothing praise God and then I'm gonna tell you what you can go get what you want now and that'll be paid off too just go and get what you want and that is paid off too anything you desire just go on get it and and I'll take care of that too are you up there and you say wow you you mean it I I he means what he said go into anything else you need amen I Supply I supply all your needs just anything you need just go ahead on because our supply God is Rich enough to take care you'll understand the magnitude of what God is saying to you and I it doesn't matter if you were born in sin shaping and iniquity it doesn't matter how many mistakes you made it doesn't matter how bad you were how terrible you were God said amen when you go before the judge you don't have to feel like you're nervous and shaking because he gonna give you 20 years to 30 years you can go before the judge amen and you can say amen I got an eternity attorney amen and I got somebody amen say Amen to the already paid my my dad are you with me isn't it good that the judge that you go before is your attorney amen what if the judge in the attorney was the same one amen did you have nothing to worry about isn't it right the one that can condemn you I can send you Amen to hell is the one amen that's signing amen as your attorney are you up there so you say amen I ain't got nothing to worry about amen praise God when I go before the judge I can say hallelujah my attorney has taken care don't worry everybody think a lot of attorneys tell you amen just give me uh 50 000 and don't worry about a thing because I'll pay off the judge and all the prosecutor and all of them that's enough to split up he said this is the way it works yeah well if that's the way it works then I got to come up with fifty thousand dollars because if I don't want to go to jail are you with me the system is corrupt it looked like the vote with the most money get off for the crime isn't that right but God is a righteous judge I say he's a righteous judge it ain't gonna be no under the table or schemes and tricks amen Paul praise God he said whatever right I'll pay but you got to know that you can have the right attorney amen when you got to face God and go before the judge of all the Earth amen you've got to stand before God you can know that amen my attorney I got full confidence in him praise God I've got four complete confidence amen praise God hallelujah has he taken care of it he said I took care I took care amen of your uh sins I took care of your problem I took care of it so his show you sure he took care of it you certain you you took care I took care of it I didn't paid the debt praise God the debt has been paid praise God you know what folks don't understand the Simplicity of what Jesus has done that he truly paid the debt he truly has paid for your sin but it it won't do you no good if you don't believe that if you do not believe that he paid the price it won't do you no good until you willing to believe that he has dotted if you don't believe it you won't receive it oh you want me somebody said well I know I I I I I'll believe that the the lawyer can do that are you paying your money in vain if you can't take care why you why are you giving your money are you with me but if you don't believe Jesus can do what it has it can't do what he's already done it amen he don't have to do it he's already done it are you with me and because he's already done it amen you can rest Assurance amen that your sins have been forgiven because what it took to forgive you sin Jesus Christ has paid that debt are you your sins are forgiven it's up to you to receive your forgiveness praise God and if you receive it then God will give you a proof he'll give you a token praise God that you have received and you are a believer and if you are a Believer you don't have to no more be a sinner oh God have mercy hey God Hallelujah I don't have to walk with my head over say I'm trying to be a live right I'm trying to do right amen and your trying is all over you don't have to do try to do something that you will never be able to achieve but Jesus Christ have already achieved it for you the blood is already the price is all right everybody Hallelujah what's using you trying let's not by trying this my trust amen I Trust You Lord oh God Amen I got no doubt in my mind amen I don't doubt the blood no my brother sister the blood of Jesus as a tone amen here it has a tone for my sin they met a nice Power in the Blood well yes the power to forgive my sin the power to oh Hallelujah wash and make it clear there's power in the blood one in working power in the precious blood I'll tell his blood is precious it's precious to me and you amen the precious blood of Jesus amen hallelujah but there are many that sat around says I've accepted Jesus Christ I'm a Christian but are you are you confident are you confident that Jesus Christ see it was all about the blood of bulls and goats in the ashes of heifers and all of that sacrifice for the flesh but how about you conscious do you feel still feel like a sinner you're still being tormented and the devil bring it up see until you're convinced that the blood has not lost his power if you were convinced that the blood of Jesus Christ has done exactly what he set out to do once you convinced of that huh devil you can't accuse me no more you can accuse but it ain't working on me because I truly believe that Jesus Christ paid my debt I'm not a sinner I'm not an unbeliever I believe the gospel and if I believe the gospel it is the power of God yeah the blood has not lost his power hey what the gospel mean to you it means that Jesus died bearing in roads again amen do you believe that that he died he was buried and he rose again and in depth somebody said he took the stain of death look what he said here in Acts I got to read it but brother and sister you'll always be bound up twist up tied up and Tangled Up if you don't catch a hole to the blood what it means you're always struggle but he said whom the free gift whom the son is set free is free indeed you must receive the free gift the gift of God the wages of sin is what but the gift of God the gift that Jesus gave himself he gave his life for you the gift of God is eternal life he died for you this is the free gift that you don't have to die and go to hell you don't have to be struggling with the things of this world The Works of the flesh the cancer of this life if you love the world the love of the father is not in you when you are struggling and battling you're struggling because of your identity the battles that you're facing is because you light your identity you don't know who you are but if you recognize who you are then you have power to stand but if you still feel like a sinner act like you act like a center that you feel still don't understand the power of the blood then you'll still be twisted up tie that Tangled Up fixed up but once you recognize that I'm a son of God these people around me and these things around me amen this little sinful world I got a heaven loan to me I got streets of gold belong to me I got a God that's on my side that will never leave me never forsake me my father is rich and houses in land he holds the wealth what's the world in his hand I got a guard that cares for me Hallelujah let's not make this journey complicated amen sometimes praise God amen I I I I'm a member of a church I'm in the message I'm the snap but you don't recognize you're in Christ I said you in Christ by faith amen we accepted Christ we're in Jesus Christ that makes the difference you could be in the church praise God you can be a part of Brian Tabernacle but not a part of Christ you've got to be in Christ that's only one way Jesus said I'm the way the truth in the life amen God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son

know it's real brother and sister the devil can make you doubt who you are for just a moment amen but God won't leave you in despair amen the devil can make your doubt just a little bit about who you are and then things could go on all twist and turn and all backwards and and things could get all twisted up when the devil bring a little bit down when he brings that little bit of doubt you begin to not be sure of your salvation praise God not certain that the blood of Jesus Hallelujah oh God that the blood of Jesus Amen is strong enough power for nothing the perish your conscious from dead works that you can serve the Living God yes Lord oh Hallelujah there he did it for me my conscience will no more a desire to do the things of the world though the devil come back and he knocks you a little bit and he gets you a little confused for a little season but he can't hold you down amen he gets a little confused a little cold out balance but he can't hold you down and sin praise God because once

he should be holding of it the devil can't hold you ain't gonna hold you but you can't hold me the power that's in the blood amen that's why Jesus amen the scripture said thou will not leave his soul in Hell neither would I suffer the Holy One to seek corruption thou hath made known to me the way of life I said God has made known unto you and I the way of life hey man I don't have to walk around all confused up the devil don't he can't mess up my life no more yeah I got a greater purpose for living I'm living amen hallelujah this life that I can live again praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus I'm on my way to heaven I'm enjoying my trip praise God praise God the devil amen tried everything he can do amen for Jesus to come down from the cross are you they said you save others yourself you can't save but Jesus stayed up on the cross not for himself somebody said he could have called Ten Thousand Angels but he didn't stay on the cross because he amen he had done something wrong amen but he saw you and I the one day we would need a savior one day we would need healing one day we would be pounding up twisting up tired of Tangled Up mixed up and we needed a savior praise God we needed God I said he saw many sons and daughters of God he saw that you'll be sitting here this morning in need amen of a savior and he died there when they spit on him and they pierced him and they called him everything if you be the Son of God come down he didn't have to prove it to nobody brother and sister won't you have accepted the blood of Jesus Christ and what Jesus had died for your sins once you have accepted that then all the Devils the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail amen because amen Jesus Christ has already prevailed he's already taken care of the sin business ever have it every deformity every sickness every sin everything that the devil have robbed and stoned and killed and stole and destroyed Jesus Christ said I've made peace with God through the blood of his cross in other words I've achieved your peace I've achieved your healing now it's up to you take God is my sin really forgiven am I really a son or daughter God see that's what the devil does don't you yeah any of you thinking well I don't know that's all he has to do give you a little bit of I don't know I don't know if I I thought I thought and it worked for a little while but some it didn't seem like it did enough for me it's not that the blood has lost its power it's not that Jesus got weak is that the devil started messing with your mind and making you up isn't that right when the devil gets you just to die to look what just said what just a little bit then he gets you to doubt a little bit that he got interest you can come in then you're back to your old tricks doing your old things your back line you're back fornicating you're back doing this and doing that why because you listen to his life isn't that right but you got to turn you got to turn around now let's just go to first John and I'm going to close here I I thought I was going to close a long time ago and I was I was already closing first John one and and six y'all all right this morning don't you know many of you gonna walk out here and still said I don't understand no I I don't understand I don't know how to believe the prophet of God said the hyssop that they took and put the blood on the doorpost in the lent he said that meant simple faith if you had enough Faith to get out put your clothes on this morning that same kind of faith you apply the blood like that it's nothing that you gotta imagine not super duper nothing it's just that I accepted simply are you with me I accept what Jesus died for my sins I accept that and the simple faith it'll work how long it has never lost its world it would never fail he would never fail you but the devil's job is to get you to doubt the power of the blood his job is to come to you and tell you like he told Lee you should not surely die get you to doubt what Dr word and right now he's trying to get you to doubt what Jesus died for your sins and if you believe that Jesus died for your sins then you don't have to be a sinner no longer are you with me but if the devil come and give you that little bit of doubt then what you do you start acting like a sinner because you don't believe that Jesus died for your sin but if you believe that you he died for your sin then you're going to accept your forgiveness and you're not a sinner anymore what are you your son or daughter God are you with me because you've accepted Jesus Christ now you said would that make me uh that I won't make mistakes no you you might stumble you might fall just like a baby crawling a baby crawl get back up but that don't take away the fact that you still a child of God you trip up devil put stumbling blocks in your way but you'll get back up because why that baby has been born it's still amen got life in it but the stumbling and the falling and all of that one day you'll be strong enough to walk one day you'll be strong enough but you just don't go a baby ain't supposed to go and get 15 years old and still can't walk are you with me and some folk get uh go to church and say I'm a Christian 15 20 years and still can't walk are you living now come on something wrong you need to Recon affirm your faith you need to go back and do your first work over you need to make certain that you got what you say you have amen you need to go back to the basics as a Lord amen have I really for my heart and do I really mean I've surrendered my life to Jesus do I really affirm that sometimes we have to check ourselves because God's word can't fail us okay I got a first John uh one and six if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in what Darkness we were are y'all with me did Brother Simmons say that the Bible said that isn't that right and do not the truth but if we walk what as he's into what we have what and what see what happens the blood cleanses a small sin then he says if we what if we say we have what we deceive our cells and what but if we what if we confess our sins he's what into what that we say we what we make him what and his word is what but he says in the second uh chapter first verse my little children are these things right eye unto you that you are that you sin not and if any man what he have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world amen now God don't want you to make mistakes but if you do confess your sins for he's faithful and just to forgive you are you with me the blood works it don't matter who you are where you are is not the church it's the blood of Jesus Christ you purchase you've been purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ it's not what group of people you with is not the man that the prophet that died for your sins is not the church that did it it's not a group it's Jesus Christ he came in the flesh to die and take away the sins of the world you got to always remember that that's where you how you come to Christ by accepting the blood of Jesus Christ the death of the cross if you have not come to Jesus Christ that way you came another way if you not receive the atonement we thank God for the message we thank God for the prophet we thank God for his church but you got to come to Christ you got to come to Jesus Christ go to church assembly it says together that's the word God sent a prophet that's the word are you with me there's a message that God has given that's the word are you with me but to get your sins forgiven you got to come to Jesus Christ if you come to do all these other things and don't come in by the door brother and sister that's where the failure is that's where we make all our mistakes that's what we stumble because we never we don't have that relationship with Jesus Christ are you with me and sometimes see we can want the church to do certain things the preacher to do certain things the message but we got to know that Jesus Christ has done it all everything that we needed done Jesus Christ has paid the price for anything that we ever could do any mistake anything we need Jesus Christ has paid the price are you with me what he died on the cross the price has been paid I'm gonna tell you something brother and sister if you accept Jesus Christ you that's the greatest thing you could ever do in your life nothing is going to replace Jesus nothing is going to replace the cross there is no other thing that's going to take the place of the blood of Jesus Christ nothing that I don't care how deep the mistress I don't care how great the man I don't care how great the whatever the blood of Jesus Christ and what Jesus did for us on the cross nothing can replace it we can't downplay it we can't make it of a less important if without the shed in the blood there is no remission of sin there's no forgiveness there's no way we could get
