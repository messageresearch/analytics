[33:52] in your bibles tonight turn with me
[33:55] two places of scripture
[33:57] first we'll go to the book of
[33:59] [Music]
[34:00] saint mark
[34:10] saint mark the 16th
[34:13] chapter
[34:24] very familiar
[34:26] scripture reading
[34:30] but i want to try to take it from a
[34:32] different angle
[34:33] tonight
[34:36] saint mark 16 15-20
[34:40] and then i want to go to the book of
[34:41] acts 1-8
[34:46] and he said unto them
[34:49] go ye into all the world
[34:52] and preach the gospel to every creature
[34:55] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[34:57] be saved
[34:59] but he that believeth not shall be
[35:01] damned
[35:03] and these signs shall follow
[35:06] them that believe
[35:08] in my name shall they cast out devils
[35:12] they shall speak with new tongues
[35:15] they shall take up serpents
[35:18] if they drink any daily thing
[35:21] it shall not hurt them
[35:24] they shall lay hands on the sick
[35:27] and they shall recover
[35:30] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[35:33] them
[35:34] he will receive up into heaven and sat
[35:38] on the right hand of god
[35:41] and they went forth and preached
[35:44] everywhere
[35:45] the lord working with them
[35:49] and confirming the word
[35:52] with signs
[35:54] following them
[35:56] one scripture there acts one and eight
[35:58] and we'll come back to um there
[36:07] one in eight acts one and eight said but
[36:10] ye shall receive power
[36:12] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[36:15] you
[36:16] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[36:19] in jerusalem
[36:21] and in your deer
[36:23] and in samaria and into the uttermost
[36:27] parts of the earth let us pray
[36:30] father we thank you god for the reading
[36:32] of your word
[36:34] god we pray dear god for your holy
[36:36] spirit tonight lord that you were quick
[36:38] quicken it lord and
[36:40] praise god for the right atmosphere god
[36:43] for
[36:44] your anointing lord i pray god that you
[36:47] bless o god the people
[36:50] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[36:53] amen amen be seated
[37:02] i want to use for
[37:04] just for a few minutes tonight uh
[37:07] something that we were working with
[37:11] back in marion for a while
[37:16] and i want to entitle it god
[37:19] confirming his word
[37:23] god
[37:25] confirming
[37:27] his word
[37:29] and i know many of us have heard this
[37:32] read and
[37:34] we've heard many different
[37:36] sermons
[37:38] about
[37:40] god confirming his word
[37:46] and i know that
[37:47] many of us have preached it i know
[37:49] basically every preacher generally have
[37:51] preached it
[37:54] but i'm understanding that
[37:58] until that word
[38:01] be quickened
[38:05] we have
[38:06] letter
[38:10] now god
[38:11] when he
[38:12] gave us the word and
[38:16] he
[38:16] was dealing with his disciples teaching
[38:19] them
[38:21] when he was in his earthly ministry
[38:25] and he also even in one place gave them
[38:29] power
[38:30] to go to heal the sick
[38:33] cast out devils
[38:37] and what he was doing even after his
[38:39] demonstration
[38:41] of showing
[38:43] that uh
[38:44] he had something
[38:48] with him
[38:51] he had a power
[38:56] that he was
[38:58] demonstrating
[39:00] to the people on earth that now
[39:04] i just didn't come like any other
[39:07] preacher
[39:08] are trying to start a certain church but
[39:11] i'm actually showing you that
[39:15] god wants to confirm the word
[39:22] religion
[39:25] has
[39:26] betrayed people as a
[39:29] social
[39:32] ism of
[39:34] uh a gospel
[39:37] but yet
[39:40] the gospel has not really been
[39:43] demonstrated
[39:47] now to us we know about it
[39:51] and god gave a distinct vindication
[39:56] even in the serpent he said now before
[39:58] you go in the way he said now
[40:00] go to jerusalem
[40:03] and entirely there wait there
[40:08] because you're going to need something
[40:13] because he knew that the religious
[40:16] people of that day
[40:18] they could read the very same scripture
[40:26] they can read the very word
[40:29] just like it was writ but he said but go
[40:32] to jerusalem until
[40:35] i give you power
[40:41] and that word power actually authority
[40:45] because god got the power but he gave
[40:49] the church of that thing
[40:53] the authority to use
[40:57] you know what what good are you having
[41:00] something and you don't never use it
[41:05] and god
[41:06] as we know
[41:07] and heard
[41:09] thousands hundreds of years that
[41:12] this bible had been preached
[41:15] every nation has every country
[41:19] know about the gospel of jesus christ
[41:24] but very few people
[41:28] have the god confirming the word
[41:35] in other words that
[41:37] this gospel that
[41:39] we are talking about
[41:42] it got power to deliver
[41:47] it has power to transform you
[41:53] oh my
[41:55] it has power to to cause us to live
[42:00] differently
[42:03] it has power to change
[42:07] your very desire that you've been born
[42:09] with
[42:12] but you got to know where the power is
[42:15] at
[42:17] no church has it
[42:20] no certain preacher can give it to you
[42:24] but here in the book of acts he told
[42:27] them now um
[42:29] stay there
[42:31] until you be endued
[42:33] with power
[42:38] and i'm going to sin it
[42:41] jesus said i'm going to send the power
[42:45] how long you just wait
[42:48] and when it comes you will know that
[42:51] it's here
[42:54] and they believe the word they they
[42:57] followed what jesus had told them
[43:02] and as they waited in a paroon
[43:06] it never said how long it was
[43:09] but yet
[43:10] they had to believe
[43:12] what god had told them
[43:16] and the bible say now faith come by
[43:19] hearing
[43:21] and hearing
[43:23] of the
[43:24] word so they were there
[43:29] on what accord
[43:32] waiting
[43:35] for the promise of the father
[43:38] to me being manifest in them
[43:46] i wonder sometime
[43:50] have we received the power
[43:56] our church
[43:59] or you as a believer
[44:05] you
[44:06] are entitled to this same power
[44:13] but you must believe
[44:16] the word
[44:19] as god gave it to from there jesus and
[44:22] mark
[44:23] as he gave it to him that was saying
[44:26] they went
[44:28] see faith caused you to move
[44:33] because i say faith without works is
[44:36] dead
[44:38] and if god promised you sister or
[44:41] brother anything my god is able to do it
[44:50] if there's any a time that the church of
[44:53] the living god
[44:54] need the power of god it's right now
[44:59] there's never been a day
[45:02] never been an hour that
[45:04] we
[45:05] are seeing
[45:07] our christians
[45:09] living beneath
[45:12] their god-given privileges
[45:16] and you wonder why
[45:21] why are we so tossed and why are we so
[45:24] defeated like we don't know what to do
[45:29] it's because a liking of the power
[45:36] and sometimes the devil doesn't put this
[45:40] little betrayal on us and and keeping us
[45:44] down
[45:49] and putting us in fear
[45:53] that god
[45:54] won't do what he said
[45:58] but i want to tell you tonight it's time
[46:01] for us to move
[46:05] if we don't move now when
[46:12] we need deliverance
[46:17] spiritually and physically we need
[46:19] deliverance
[46:23] when we need it right now
[46:27] i can't wait to another servant i can't
[46:30] wait to a good sermon or a good prince
[46:34] lord i need the power right now
[46:39] why because the devil is flexing his
[46:43] powers
[46:45] political economically uh
[46:49] our every nation they're flexing their
[46:53] power
[46:54] they're making threats they're they're
[46:56] making this allegation that allegation
[46:59] church what about us
[47:07] i think it's time no i know it's time
[47:11] for us to really be about our father's
[47:14] business
[47:16] you know in the beginning of christ say
[47:18] lord
[47:19] i need it right now
[47:23] and i know
[47:24] that the state that uh the people are in
[47:28] or round our church folks
[47:32] the one that god gave this
[47:36] promise who gave the word y'all the
[47:38] problem ain't with the word we got the
[47:40] truth
[47:42] but the problem is get the truth to
[47:45] activate
[47:48] to get it to to come alive
[47:52] and i'm talking about not as a group but
[47:55] come alive in you
[47:57] in me
[48:00] because when you got something you know
[48:03] what you got
[48:06] and not boasting of anything
[48:08] but one day i remember
[48:10] peter those were going to prayer service
[48:14] oh my what a time for god to send the
[48:17] power
[48:19] and there was a man there by the church
[48:22] going to prayer you see what prayer
[48:24] service to do
[48:26] at that hour of prayer there was a man
[48:30] sit there begging for arms
[48:34] looking
[48:36] to receive something
[48:40] peter those that day
[48:43] if they were going to prayer i believe
[48:45] that was something that they did regular
[48:49] to go to prayer service
[48:52] no doubt
[48:55] peter them my inspiration
[48:58] saw that man and bible say the eyes
[49:01] fastened on him
[49:04] and they began to say
[49:06] look on us
[49:09] why because they saw a man that he
[49:12] needed
[49:13] he thought he needed arms or money
[49:17] and peter said no no no no silver gold
[49:21] have i none but such as i have i give
[49:25] unto thee
[49:28] he didn't say we give he said i
[49:31] give unto thee
[49:33] in the name of jesus rise up
[49:38] peter knew what he had
[49:41] and when you know what you got then you
[49:43] ought to use that
[49:46] it's not how much you know but do you
[49:50] know him
[49:53] do you know him his life
[49:56] oh my
[49:58] telling the truth i said listen
[50:01] we can't be sitting back looking for a
[50:04] good sermon to be preached to us
[50:08] we need god and we need them right now
[50:13] oh my
[50:16] i've been reading some things
[50:19] you as i look at the
[50:21] calvin and knox and
[50:24] all of those reformers and luther and
[50:27] wesley and you know even in that time
[50:31] they had signs and wonders
[50:35] god
[50:37] was confirming the word
[50:40] i looked up the word confirmed
[50:44] i i like i got real happy when i saw it
[50:48] i had an idea but
[50:50] it brought a better understanding to me
[50:55] and it said confirming means to
[50:58] to give new assurance
[51:02] of that
[51:04] of
[51:05] remove doubt
[51:08] oh my
[51:10] by
[51:11] authoritarian excuse me act are
[51:14] indisputed facts
[51:17] in other words god wants to move
[51:21] all the doubt
[51:23] about the gospel
[51:26] so god himself know not nobody but the
[51:29] god confirmed the word
[51:34] because if the world has been preached
[51:36] right
[51:37] and it's even believed right
[51:40] then god can confirm it like he said
[51:44] but there must be
[51:46] somebody that's going to catch it
[51:51] oh my
[51:55] intellectualism
[51:58] won't be able to produce this
[52:03] knowledge which is all right
[52:07] the gospel as people know it
[52:12] it's more than just telling people how
[52:14] good jesus is
[52:16] though that's good he is good
[52:20] but you really don't know how good he is
[52:23] until he confirm the word
[52:26] until god give us
[52:30] each one a personal
[52:32] experience
[52:34] with him
[52:36] that you can say i know
[52:40] my redeemer living
[52:43] i know that the god that i'm serving he
[52:46] is more than able to do what he said
[52:50] he'll do
[52:51] how do you know he did it with me
[52:55] see your very life
[52:58] ought to be a living testimony
[53:02] your living life
[53:04] your each one of us wherever you go
[53:10] you ought to be a lighthouse
[53:14] the way when people come in your
[53:16] presence
[53:17] they know something's with you
[53:20] devils tremble when you come
[53:24] the conversation has changed
[53:27] why because
[53:28] there's another presence there
[53:31] they're not able to sing and to do like
[53:34] they used to why because the power is
[53:37] there
[53:41] not to condemn
[53:43] but come to deliver
[53:47] that man that
[53:49] peter though prayed for
[53:52] after
[53:55] god raised them up see
[53:59] what would happen god been confirming
[54:01] the word
[54:03] they had then received the power
[54:07] they were in that upper room men and
[54:10] women
[54:12] and when that power come it shook
[54:18] that place they were in
[54:21] i don't know about these experiences
[54:23] that i'm hearing you know this quiet
[54:25] holy ghost
[54:27] i know it all about emotion but let me
[54:29] tell you something
[54:31] when the holy ghost came in the bible
[54:33] days they might have was quiet before it
[54:35] came
[54:36] but when it came bro i said they weren't
[54:39] like drunk man
[54:41] [Music]
[54:44] no no no no it wasn't quite anymore
[54:47] brother why because he came
[54:51] and when the power of god come or
[54:53] wherever jesus go there's a lot of noise
[54:58] and if you don't like the noise of jesus
[55:00] there's gonna be noise in another place
[55:02] too
[55:06] well when though people saw them
[55:07] striking like that room they said they
[55:10] drunk
[55:12] they thought they were in that upper
[55:14] room
[55:15] drinking wine
[55:18] oh no no but peter
[55:21] when he heard it he said no brother no
[55:24] we're not drunk
[55:26] and you support what did he do he
[55:29] pointed them back to joelle
[55:32] the very scripture identified this is
[55:37] that
[55:41] we ought to be able to point to the very
[55:43] scripture that have been spoken of us
[55:45] this is that
[55:50] oh my
[55:51] what are you doing
[55:52] what am i doing
[55:54] i'm letting god confirm the word
[55:58] come on somebody we're not we don't have
[56:01] a weak guard
[56:02] our god is powerful
[56:05] and he's not dead he's alive but then
[56:09] where is he at right here
[56:18] no more time to sit back
[56:21] what are we hiding back for
[56:24] everything else is out
[56:27] anybody's saying or nothing no more come
[56:30] on it's no time to sit back now
[56:33] come on let's show the world that you
[56:36] are one in a million
[56:38] what the people are looking for is a
[56:41] real
[56:42] powerful jesus
[56:44] never god just talked about or read
[56:47] about a sing about
[56:49] devil screaming
[56:52] amen
[56:54] oh yeah
[56:57] i was telling them trust me
[56:59] they're gonna be many they're gonna be
[57:00] looking on
[57:02] and wondering what you doing
[57:04] and you ain't even gonna answer them
[57:06] okay you know because we don't have time
[57:08] for that
[57:09] but you know you're moving into
[57:11] something you look at this word now then
[57:14] it came off
[57:16] the book
[57:17] come on the word this ain't on the book
[57:19] no more the bird out of word ought to be
[57:22] in you
[57:23] you become the manifestation of what god
[57:27] spoke of you in this hour
[57:35] oh yeah it's time to move
[57:38] not by your might but by the power of
[57:41] god
[57:43] that's what the church of the living god
[57:44] need
[57:46] the servant of god said something here
[57:48] that was so striking
[57:50] he said we are missing the power
[57:54] that's what's wrong with the churches
[57:56] he said they got truth
[57:59] but that you need to be enlightening
[58:02] it need to be quickened
[58:05] and only the holy spirit can quicken
[58:08] that word and when the word is quickened
[58:11] it'll cause you to act
[58:14] unseemly
[58:17] but act right according to what the
[58:20] scripture said of you
[58:23] this is our day
[58:26] they had a day in the bible
[58:29] he said the church of god
[58:32] that she will be the continuation
[58:36] of the book of acts
[58:38] we are to continue
[58:40] the commission he said the last
[58:43] commission that jesus said is to god
[58:47] preach the gospel
[58:49] and i'm gonna give you something
[58:52] i'm gonna i'll confirm your word
[58:56] because it's not your word
[58:59] and bible say they went forth look at
[59:01] that
[59:02] 20th verse mark
[59:06] 16 and 20.
[59:08] he said and they
[59:10] went forth
[59:12] and preached
[59:14] everywhere
[59:18] the lord
[59:20] working with them see
[59:23] that's what you want
[59:25] be sure you get god first
[59:28] don't do nothing till he come
[59:32] go to the upper room parry there wait
[59:36] until power come
[59:39] and when the power will come
[59:41] then you go everywhere
[59:44] preaching the gospel and god here was
[59:48] working with them confirming
[59:52] what they spoke with signs and oneness
[59:56] or church where are the signs in the
[59:59] wonder that god has spoken of
[1:00:02] where is the power
[1:00:05] where is the god of elijah
[1:00:10] oh my
[1:00:12] is he here are we looking for it
[1:00:15] i want to declare to you he's here
[1:00:18] come on let's stop looking around
[1:00:21] stop looking to what has happened stop
[1:00:24] looking to what others may have done
[1:00:27] that's good for them but now how about
[1:00:30] us
[1:00:32] sisters you can lay hands on the sick
[1:00:37] if you got the power
[1:00:40] you know where you're at in the
[1:00:42] scripture
[1:00:44] god gives you authority
[1:00:47] you can cast devils out
[1:00:50] by the authority of the word
[1:00:53] be sure you got the power though
[1:00:56] don't do nothing he told him don't you
[1:00:58] go nowhere yet
[1:01:00] don't go out to all the world yet until
[1:01:05] oh that's why i believe the greatest cry
[1:01:08] in our churches ought to be
[1:01:10] let's have a prayer holy ghost night
[1:01:16] probably gonna say that's what we need
[1:01:18] he said we need to all night shut in
[1:01:22] and tell god something happened
[1:01:26] i mean not a thrill and not just a chill
[1:01:28] but we need a feeling
[1:01:32] but what he said that the church just
[1:01:34] got formal
[1:01:37] either got lukewarm
[1:01:41] the devil like a rampage
[1:01:46] making the people
[1:01:48] be belittled
[1:01:51] because of what's going on on the earth
[1:01:56] servant of god said here
[1:01:59] he said god hates a powerless religion
[1:02:06] he said it's got to have the power
[1:02:12] one plus he said if you have a religion
[1:02:14] ain't got no power he said you need to
[1:02:16] bury that
[1:02:19] and let me tell you something this is
[1:02:20] the hour you know what not now that
[1:02:23] everybody is making claims i'm the
[1:02:26] church
[1:02:28] i'm the church our church
[1:02:30] what we believe what our church what our
[1:02:33] path to say but let's go back to the
[1:02:36] scripture
[1:02:38] because that's where our identification
[1:02:40] is
[1:02:42] if you are that church of the living god
[1:02:46] then god ought to be working confirming
[1:02:49] the word with signs and oneness
[1:02:52] don't just say and i know we can say it
[1:02:55] because it's written in the bible that
[1:02:57] god is a healer
[1:03:00] until you see god heal
[1:03:03] until you know
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] he's a healer
[1:03:09] we need the supernatural
[1:03:13] but to get the people minds in a
[1:03:16] condition
[1:03:17] and get it off of what's going on that's
[1:03:20] i believe it was the problem we've been
[1:03:21] distracted
[1:03:24] all this going on amongst us and what's
[1:03:27] going on in russia what's going on all
[1:03:29] this or that or death or that but the
[1:03:32] servants of god say normally
[1:03:35] in the darkest hours is when the
[1:03:38] supernatural take place
[1:03:40] oh when it gets so bad and everything
[1:03:44] seemed to be chaotic watch the
[1:03:46] supernatural then
[1:03:48] watch the church move in the power of
[1:03:52] jesus christ right in the midst of the
[1:03:55] world by to go crazy
[1:03:59] and people are giving up hope
[1:04:01] but they're going to be a people that's
[1:04:03] going to catch
[1:04:04] the vision
[1:04:05] and they're going to understand
[1:04:08] come on i don't have time for this i got
[1:04:11] to have the power of god working
[1:04:13] preachers you've got to have the power
[1:04:16] of god
[1:04:19] not just the intellectual of the message
[1:04:22] we need to see jesus
[1:04:25] that's what they told that man they said
[1:04:27] sir
[1:04:29] we would see
[1:04:31] jesus oh my
[1:04:34] what a uh uh a contradiction
[1:04:38] they want to hear but they wanted to see
[1:04:41] jesus
[1:04:44] how are you going to see jesus
[1:04:46] jesus was god
[1:04:49] manifested in the flesh
[1:04:52] and all that god was he poured it into
[1:04:55] jesus
[1:04:57] and all that jesus had he poured it into
[1:05:01] the church
[1:05:04] oh my
[1:05:06] what kind of people we ought to be
[1:05:11] he said the greatest curse he said fear
[1:05:15] he said they are scared they ain't not
[1:05:17] going to work
[1:05:19] church god word will work
[1:05:23] if that word can find a resting place in
[1:05:27] somebody's heart god will go to work
[1:05:31] but that word must fall on good ground
[1:05:35] no doubt no wavering
[1:05:37] i believe lord
[1:05:40] oh my
[1:05:43] no wonder he loved that song
[1:05:46] all things are possible
[1:05:48] only
[1:05:50] believe
[1:05:53] what kind of church we ought to be
[1:05:56] what kind of church is god looking for
[1:06:00] here he said here
[1:06:02] he said now if the church of the living
[1:06:04] god
[1:06:06] which is a pillar of truth
[1:06:09] god intended the church to be powerful
[1:06:12] church
[1:06:13] a glorious church
[1:06:16] a church that the whole world could look
[1:06:19] upon as a bride of christ
[1:06:23] well
[1:06:24] well expected
[1:06:26] in his spouse
[1:06:28] and live in such
[1:06:31] an atmosphere and conduct itself in such
[1:06:35] a way that god will be proud of this
[1:06:39] church to present it to christ at the
[1:06:42] coming of the lord
[1:06:45] you see what kind of church god looking
[1:06:47] for
[1:06:49] that's why you don't have time to be
[1:06:51] lukewarm
[1:06:53] come on sampson shake yourself
[1:06:58] some
[1:06:59] played around with delilah
[1:07:02] uh a long time a type of the world he
[1:07:04] played around
[1:07:06] with the world too long and
[1:07:08] and she had him
[1:07:12] script
[1:07:14] of the power
[1:07:16] she found out he told her
[1:07:21] his secret
[1:07:23] you tell the world your secret
[1:07:27] and the devil will script you
[1:07:31] of your power
[1:07:33] your prayer life
[1:07:36] is your power
[1:07:39] no prayer no power
[1:07:43] it's up to you and i
[1:07:46] i'm not gonna be like everybody else
[1:07:49] why because god called you
[1:07:54] each one of us
[1:07:57] god called you
[1:08:00] to manifest his word
[1:08:03] we're not a group but individually
[1:08:08] turning the cities upside down
[1:08:12] oh my lord
[1:08:15] but what are going to happen to howler
[1:08:18] we need to get back to prayer
[1:08:22] i mean crying out
[1:08:25] god
[1:08:26] we need the power right now
[1:08:31] our families our loved ones we see
[1:08:35] the condition we see the condition of
[1:08:37] the church
[1:08:38] we see the condition even around the
[1:08:41] message of the hour
[1:08:43] there's a a a lukewarmness
[1:08:47] there's a spirit of just giving the
[1:08:49] people some intellectual
[1:08:51] thing that what been said but where is
[1:08:54] the power
[1:08:57] come on either god is living or he's
[1:08:59] dead
[1:09:01] either we we're living in the our glare
[1:09:05] of what somebody else said and what i
[1:09:08] know that they say what he's saying i
[1:09:10] don't mind doing that but i want to see
[1:09:12] the manifestation of what he said
[1:09:18] but god never took his power
[1:09:20] he took his man but not in spirit
[1:09:23] even when in days of elijah and elisha
[1:09:26] elisha know that a lot it was going to
[1:09:28] go away and the people were trying to
[1:09:29] get don't you know your servant going to
[1:09:31] go he said
[1:09:33] i know it hold your peace
[1:09:36] what he was telling him come on i can't
[1:09:38] afford to be distracted
[1:09:40] i'm following something
[1:09:42] see when you know what you follow it it
[1:09:44] doesn't care what nobody else said you
[1:09:46] got a revelation
[1:09:48] i will not
[1:09:52] listen to what you have to say but i'm
[1:09:54] going to follow the pill on fire
[1:09:56] and elisha and father elijah went
[1:09:59] through different phrases and jordan in
[1:10:01] different places until elijah
[1:10:04] tried to even discourage him
[1:10:07] he said no i'm not turning around
[1:10:10] he said i know it might look like i'm
[1:10:12] following some man but no it's more than
[1:10:15] a man i'm following
[1:10:18] and when he got to the place he said but
[1:10:19] then
[1:10:20] what do you want
[1:10:23] he said i want a double potion
[1:10:26] of your spirit
[1:10:29] and a lot of he said you asked the hard
[1:10:31] thing
[1:10:32] he said nevertheless
[1:10:34] if you see me
[1:10:37] when i go it'll be granted
[1:10:40] an elixir was not going to leave he
[1:10:44] never came too far now church we didn't
[1:10:47] came too far
[1:10:50] where are you going to go now
[1:10:52] we don't see what god is able to do
[1:10:56] you have to keep your eyes when the
[1:10:58] pillow fire moved when the holy ghost
[1:11:01] move you need to move
[1:11:05] but there got to be a vision
[1:11:08] except people have a vision that people
[1:11:10] will perish

[1:17:01] he said when the preaching of the word

[1:17:14] that they're going to hell
[1:17:16] and they're on the way to the lake of
[1:17:17] fire

[1:17:27] oftentimes we see people on their way to
[1:17:29] hell
[1:17:31] and nobody want to stop them it's just
[1:17:33] like you're seeing somebody running out

[1:17:46] you see somebody on their way to hell
[1:17:51] to the lake of fire
[1:17:54] and he said what if the house is on fire
[1:17:58] and you in it
[1:18:00] burning up
[1:18:05] somebody got to recognize your house is
