[42:32] the book of Acts 13
[42:38] acts 13 and 44.
[42:42] I read the first you read the next
[42:44] and re-read the last verse together
[42:48] acts 13 and 44.
[42:51] the next Sabbath day came almost the
[42:54] whole city together to hear the words of
[42:58] God 45.
[43:10] and then Paul and barnwell's wax bold
[43:13] and said
[43:14] it was necessary that the word of God
[43:18] should be first have been spoken to you
[43:22] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[43:27] yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[43:31] Lo we turn to the Gentiles 47.
[43:45] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[43:48] were Glide and glorified the word of the
[43:52] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[43:56] eternal life believe 49.
[44:03] but the Jews stirred up The Devout and
[44:07] honorable women and the chief men of the
[44:10] city and raise persecution against Paul
[44:15] and Barnabas and expelled them out of
[44:18] their course
[44:19] 51.
[44:25] gather the disciples were filled with
[44:28] joy and with the Holy Ghost may God
[44:31] bless you read this word you may be
[44:33] seated
[44:34] in the 48th verse she says
[44:37] at the end of it it says
[44:40] as many as were ordained to eternal life
[44:43] believe
[44:46] you know I I I was telling them Marlins
[44:49] on Thursday that we were gonna
[44:51] start it off with uh born for a purpose
[44:55] for this purpose or this cause was I
[44:58] born
[44:59] but I thought we just this morning
[45:03] die of praying and
[45:06] ordained to eternal life I just couldn't
[45:08] get away from it it looked like it's all
[45:10] running together ordained to eternal
[45:13] life
[45:14] now sometimes we struggle in trying to
[45:17] understand the mind of God and
[45:19] understand the purpose of God and the
[45:20] will of God just trying to understand
[45:22] God man in this finite mind cannot
[45:25] understand the infinite Mind Of God but
[45:28] yet he tries to figure out and he blames
[45:30] god with his little finite mind amen
[45:34] knowing that God by violence he said
[45:38] your thoughts are not my thoughts and
[45:39] and and see what man think that he's
[45:42] just got a little intellect that God
[45:45] allows him to have for a few moments and
[45:48] so he he tries to figure out that amen
[45:51] that he can come back God and what God
[45:54] purpose and what God is doing he tries
[45:57] to bombard he tries to understand see if
[46:01] we're going to serve God the Bible said
[46:03] he that cometh to God because first of
[46:04] all believe that he is and he is a
[46:07] reward of them that dealing to seek him
[46:09] and it is something about believing that
[46:13] God is
[46:14] amen he said the invisible thing to God
[46:18] had clearly May has seen by the things
[46:21] which are made so you see the heaven you
[46:24] see the Earth you see even yourself the
[46:27] Bible said is he has made us and not we
[46:29] ourselves
[46:31] well you know where do we come from amen
[46:34] the Bible said God created man in his
[46:37] own image in his own likeness
[46:39] are you with me now if you can figure
[46:42] out another means another way as a
[46:44] scientific world through the test to I
[46:46] mean to twos and all kind of mixing of
[46:49] Steve or what what did they get this uh
[46:52] seed from or whatever to mix
[46:55] are you with me man can only pervert
[46:58] what God has already made
[47:01] so uh a day to eternal life these uh
[47:05] Jews that God was the chosen people
[47:07] supposedly be amen that supposedly have
[47:11] God but yet they find it necessary amen
[47:15] when light has come amen that they had
[47:18] the Old Testament and as the day we have
[47:21] the Bible they had the Old Testament
[47:23] they could say well we got the Bible we
[47:25] got Moses Abraham Isaac and Jacob but
[47:28] when God seemed to look like he's
[47:31] stepping out of the pages of the Bible
[47:32] and he's actually amen uh moving for
[47:36] amen the pro the prophecy amen and to
[47:41] the prophecy being fulfilled amen the
[47:44] word of God that was led up was being
[47:46] made manifested in the flesh but yet
[47:49] they could not recognize the
[47:51] manifestation of God God was amen
[47:55] stepping out of History amen and he was
[47:57] coming on the scene
[47:59] same thing they struggled because they
[48:02] had the letter they could go back and
[48:03] read Moses they could go back and read
[48:05] their Bibles on the side of the street
[48:07] now amen if God does something today
[48:10] amen a man that is religious go to
[48:14] church got their Bible they can look in
[48:16] their Bible and read it but when the
[48:18] when the word becomes alive they fail to
[48:21] see it
[48:23] amen now though the scripture said a
[48:26] virgin shall conceived yet when a virgin
[48:29] conceded who want to believe something
[48:31] like that I've talked about God's people
[48:34] that read their Bible all the time but
[48:36] yet when Mary comes on the scene amen
[48:41] you so Jesus you've been born a
[48:43] fornication come on man get away from
[48:45] that you know you we don't believe that
[48:47] those were God said he came into his own
[48:50] but his own what
[48:52] if he came the day he would come in the
[48:54] same way because the Bible said Jesus
[48:57] Christ is saying yesterday today and
[48:58] forever amen what you already said in
[49:01] your religion said in your church said
[49:03] in your ideals amen when the word of God
[49:06] come you already think you got it
[49:09] amen what we need we already got God
[49:11] what we need we already got the word
[49:13] what we need we don't need nothing else
[49:16] amen and that's what it and so
[49:20] Paul even Saul or Paul amen he called
[49:24] amen a ridiculous thing
[49:27] man this is mine this is uh heresy uh
[49:30] this is uh uh what are y'all trying to
[49:33] do we ain't got the one God y'all
[49:35] worship this one called Jesus what in
[49:38] the world we got Jehovah
[49:41] but they had Jehovah only in letter form
[49:45] only in the traditional
[49:47] form
[49:49] amen yet when uh amen the word became
[49:52] life they could not recognize the word
[49:54] being made and manifest because why they
[49:58] already thought they had it
[50:01] and when we already think we got what we
[50:04] it takes amen we don't see no father
[50:07] amen and accepting nothing else
[50:12] and God don't want you to accept another
[50:14] God but he wants you to accept God when
[50:17] he reveals himself in his own word
[50:20] are you up man God won't say Amen tell
[50:24] you you cannot relax amen because you
[50:27] amen come to church
[50:29] see sometimes we feel secured
[50:33] we feel secured in our uh
[50:36] uh our religious spirit
[50:40] amen sometimes we don't know where we
[50:42] get our spirit from
[50:45] and
[50:46] no more mother that God did a lot of
[50:50] wonderful things it meant to the Jews
[50:52] and a lot of Miracles and things that
[50:55] they could testify amen that God did in
[50:58] their lives
[50:59] you had a lot of folks that the new God
[51:02] and God had moved in their life and they
[51:04] had testimonies but hear the word amen
[51:08] for that day they could not recognize
[51:11] and that's what is happening amen people
[51:13] amen are are ready to say I know I know
[51:17] God what God heard my prayer God did
[51:19] this God did that yet when Jesus came on
[51:22] the scene
[51:25] no we don't need you
[51:27] amen if Jesus came today what would you
[51:31] stand
[51:32] would you be like one of these Jews hey
[51:35] what y'all doing
[51:37] you know what I'm saying that Jesus came
[51:39] today he would come the same way he came
[51:40] then
[51:42] amen he would come to you and you would
[51:46] already be secured already be I got
[51:50] everything I need I know God hurt myself
[51:53] oh Lord
[51:54] and
[51:55] it wasn't that
[51:58] Jesus didn't come to condemn the world
[52:00] but what
[52:02] save the world
[52:03] I came to seek and save that which is
[52:06] lost
[52:07] amen I didn't come to destroy what you
[52:10] got
[52:11] but I come to fulfill
[52:14] I I I didn't come to take the law away
[52:17] from you but I came to fulfill
[52:21] amen I want you to know that there's
[52:23] been a dispensation of change amen and I
[52:26] want you to know that for this time
[52:29] the law and the prophets were until John
[52:31] but from this time the kingdom of what
[52:34] God is fruit
[52:36] amen God he was talking about the
[52:39] kingdom has come
[52:41] amen and because the kingdom of God is
[52:44] preached they didn't want it why because
[52:47] they were already they've got my uh they
[52:50] were talking about David
[52:52] amen and this is what he says this is
[52:55] what this is what got them really mad in
[52:57] the 13th chapter he said
[53:01] in the 33rd verse she says God has
[53:04] fulfilled the same unto us and their
[53:08] children in that he has raised up Jesus
[53:12] again
[53:13] as it is also written
[53:18] in the second song
[53:20] Thou Art my what
[53:23] thou my son this day have I what
[53:26] and as concerning that he raised up him
[53:31] up from the dead
[53:34] now no more to return to what corruption
[53:39] he said on this wise I will give you the
[53:45] sure mercies of David
[53:47] wherefore he has
[53:50] he said also in another song thou
[53:55] shall not what
[53:59] you mean to tell me Jesus did not seek
[54:03] corruption
[54:05] are you with me
[54:07] y'all what y'all talking about
[54:10] so this is strange to the here and they
[54:12] had never heard such a thing but it was
[54:15] written in the scripture
[54:17] he was taking them back to the Bible yet
[54:20] they didn't want to believe it because
[54:22] they didn't want to believe in this
[54:24] Jesus that they have taken their wicked
[54:26] hands they've crucified and slain
[54:29] neither were the word is made manifested
[54:32] through the religious spirits today want
[54:35] to believe what the word says
[54:38] because they already think they got it
[54:44] are you a man
[54:46] when you think you got it amen it says
[54:50] for David I'm gonna tell you there's
[54:52] something can you see a ball it man
[54:54] we're talking about the kingdom that
[54:56] it's come and talk about a king and uh
[55:00] what what y'all what's wrong with these
[55:02] people that's what the Jews said y'all
[55:04] now y'all don't believe something like
[55:06] that don't you know we got the Jehovah
[55:09] God we got Abraham we got prophecy we
[55:13] got oh God Kings
[55:17] and you telling me about Jesus
[55:21] oh the attitude of those people that day
[55:25] is the same attitude of the people today
[55:30] that's why people even can sit inside
[55:32] Brad Tabernacle and have that same nasty
[55:35] spirit
[55:38] are you with me
[55:40] they can sit here and the word you see
[55:43] because if you're not a thing to eternal
[55:45] life you can't receive you can't believe
[55:50] are you with me
[55:52] you say I don't care who I ain't gonna
[55:55] believe it no you won't believe it
[55:56] because you got to be a name to eternal
[55:58] life
[56:00] are you with me
[56:01] and eternal life
[56:04] is in his son
[56:07] are you with me
[56:09] and if you're gonna receive his son
[56:11] you're gonna receive his word
[56:13] are you with me you cannot receive the
[56:17] Son of God and not receive the word of
[56:19] God because the word is eternal life
[56:24] are you with me
[56:25] but a lot of folks say I receive Jesus
[56:28] but the word of God is eternal life
[56:31] he was the word but he was the word
[56:34] manifested
[56:36] brother and sister
[56:38] you were going for a purpose
[56:41] and I can't get there this morning but
[56:43] you were born to manifest the word
[56:48] and to manifest the word of God for your
[56:51] day and the hour you live in not amen
[56:54] trying to manifest what Moses did or
[56:56] what Noah did but you the manifested
[56:59] word in this last day hour
[57:03] God has chosen you here now to be the
[57:08] light of the manifestation of the word
[57:12] are you with me
[57:13] when God said let there be light there
[57:16] was light and you are the light of the
[57:19] world
[57:21] are you up there
[57:22] so God has chosen you to light up this
[57:26] dark and corrupt age that we're living
[57:28] in God has chosen you amen as the light
[57:34] even Jesus said I am the light of the
[57:37] world
[57:38] but men love Darkness rather than light
[57:40] because they're white
[57:42] the Deeds are evil
[57:44] amen if they were of the light they
[57:47] would come to the light
[57:49] are you with me
[57:50] I'm not you know you said well what's
[57:54] the preface Amy tell everybody God loves
[57:57] you and everybody going to heaven and
[57:58] it's going to be all right
[58:01] but if if everybody went to heaven it'd
[58:04] be just like it is here
[58:07] are you with me
[58:09] we have all this sin corruption all this
[58:13] oh me nasty all this all this filthy and
[58:18] all these spirits that these people are
[58:20] going to carry to help them with them
[58:22] because if they go to experience
[58:26] going with them isn't that right if you
[58:29] go to heaven your attitude gonna go
[58:31] right there with you I I know God and
[58:34] let me
[58:36] I heard one uh
[58:38] a man of God says oh Lord I call the man
[58:42] of God because you say he is
[58:44] one of the largest churches in Colombia
[58:46] I was at a funeral
[58:49] and the preacher said
[58:52] um
[58:54] it was one of our friends came up in
[58:56] church with us
[58:57] but she
[58:59] sort of went to her persuasion and she
[59:02] became a minister
[59:04] and at her funeral
[59:07] the the Pastor said
[59:10] oh when sister so and so on get to
[59:13] heaven
[59:14] she gonna say I don't want to see Jesus
[59:18] but I want to see Paul because I'm going
[59:21] to straighten you out when you said a
[59:23] woman couldn't preach
[59:32] you know I felt like what's wrong with
[59:35] this all these people said here what's
[59:38] wrong with them
[59:42] and this man a teacher in at the college
[59:46] teaching preachers and all
[59:48] and everything
[59:53] can articulate I could never touch him
[59:55] in preaching
[59:58] but
[1:00:01] we're not trying to
[1:00:03] it's the truth that we're interested in
[1:00:06] not in how well you can speak and how
[1:00:08] well you can I intelligent you are
[1:00:12] but it's a word
[1:00:14] could you imagine somebody with that
[1:00:17] kind of intelligence
[1:00:19] a teacher of preachers
[1:00:22] and yet he assess a statement like that
[1:00:24] I don't want to see Jesus I want to see
[1:00:26] Paul where I can straighten them out
[1:00:29] Lord have mercy
[1:00:32] are you with me
[1:00:36] but I I believe that today some people
[1:00:40] if they would examine themselves they'll
[1:00:43] straighten out some of the men of God
[1:00:46] that God used in such a supernatural
[1:00:48] ways and they'll tell them amen you must
[1:00:51] have a Devil Within you because I don't
[1:00:53] believe you would you you you you're
[1:00:55] true
[1:00:57] see sometimes people think that my
[1:01:00] experience with God and my intellectual
[1:01:02] intelligence even though amen I may not
[1:01:06] be as apologize you but one thing I do
[1:01:09] know I oh Lord have mercy
[1:01:12] you see what I'm saying we've got in our
[1:01:14] minds that we're we're in a place that
[1:01:17] we can examine enough amen God
[1:01:21] are you with me that we put God up into
[1:01:24] our little uh on our scale
[1:01:27] God is Not on your scale on my scale God
[1:01:31] is above our scale it's either above all
[1:01:33] that we can ask I think
[1:01:36] amen he's Beyond amen we can't and we oh
[1:01:39] your thoughts are not my thoughts and
[1:01:41] your ways are not my ways you can't oh
[1:01:44] Lord only thing amen God allows us
[1:01:47] through his Spirit just to understand
[1:01:50] what we do understand
[1:01:53] amen and that's only by the grace of God
[1:01:56] that God gives you amen a potion amen
[1:02:00] imagine
[1:02:02] and not every man has the same measure
[1:02:05] are you with me but it's only God's
[1:02:08] grace
[1:02:09] to us in our lives that God gives us
[1:02:13] Grace amen that we have imagined
[1:02:19] so thank God for the little magic that
[1:02:21] he gives us
[1:02:25] but God let me see
[1:02:28] so
[1:02:31] so he says
[1:02:33] I I got to go on I gotta I gotta off
[1:02:37] but y'all y'all sometimes you get
[1:02:40] amen people can say some stuff
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:46] I'm saying to you
[1:02:48] this morning be careful what you think
[1:02:52] be careful about your thoughts and
[1:02:55] be very careful what come out your mouth
[1:02:59] you know some things people can say out
[1:03:02] their mouth I couldn't say
[1:03:04] you know I I hate to hear people say the
[1:03:07] n-word
[1:03:09] when they said I sound like they're
[1:03:10] cursing
[1:03:14] and I said wow
[1:03:16] I can't hear that
[1:03:18] don't don't don't don't let don't be so
[1:03:21] loose with the tongue
[1:03:25] try to try to be careful how you speak
[1:03:29] just because it used to you know it's a
[1:03:31] terminology no no no no no be careful
[1:03:33] how you speak
[1:03:35] Amen Let Your word be with Grace you're
[1:03:38] Christians
[1:03:40] let your words be with Grace season with
[1:03:42] salt
[1:03:43] be careful what you say how how it comes
[1:03:47] off
[1:03:49] you know if you got the Holy Ghost the
[1:03:50] Holy Ghost
[1:03:53] you know attack you
[1:03:56] are you up man you you don't speak like
[1:03:59] that you can't say anything out your
[1:04:01] mouth amen the closer you get to God
[1:04:03] you'll find yourself walking in more
[1:04:05] maturity
[1:04:08] but when you fall off man everything can
[1:04:11] fly out your mind any kind of way you
[1:04:13] can say anything
[1:04:17] you know what I'm saying but once you
[1:04:19] once you get closer to God you examine
[1:04:22] how you say what you say
[1:04:24] are you a man now that you trying to
[1:04:27] examine it it's the holy spirit in you
[1:04:29] that won't let you say certain things
[1:04:33] and when you said it ought to check you
[1:04:37] you can't just be I I just the way I am
[1:04:40] no no no God don't have to take you the
[1:04:43] Way You Are
[1:04:45] he wants to make you the way he wants
[1:04:47] you to be
[1:04:49] are you a man
[1:04:51] God can't use you he wants to the new
[1:04:54] man amen which is created in Christ
[1:04:57] Jesus amen
[1:05:00] the recreated man the new man the new
[1:05:03] you
[1:05:05] are you with me
[1:05:07] so don't let anything come out your
[1:05:09] mouth
[1:05:12] okay I gotta go move on
[1:05:15] move on but
[1:05:17] ordain into eternal life
[1:05:20] now you couldn't tell those people
[1:05:23] you couldn't confess to him that they
[1:05:26] wouldn't have known to eternal life
[1:05:28] you couldn't convince them that they
[1:05:30] didn't have everything they needed
[1:05:33] that's what the Jews they had seen they
[1:05:37] heard about all the signs and wonders
[1:05:39] and there was God's special chosen
[1:05:42] people they were God's people
[1:05:45] but mind you Moses was born for a
[1:05:47] purpose isn't that right
[1:05:49] and the purpose because when he was born
[1:05:51] the the mother they saw that he was a
[1:05:54] proper child he was special
[1:05:57] so they put him in a little bastard and
[1:05:59] put him on the river and the Pharaoh
[1:06:01] daughter got him isn't that right
[1:06:03] God got away amen if he ordained you for
[1:06:06] a purpose God got a way to make sure
[1:06:09] that that purpose is fulfilled
[1:06:13] are you with me
[1:06:15] your reaction and your response to the
[1:06:18] word of God shows your destiny
[1:06:22] are you with me how you respond to the
[1:06:26] word it shows whether or not you believe
[1:06:28] the word or not
[1:06:32] those that were dead to eternal life the
[1:06:35] Bible said they believed
[1:06:37] the rest of my arms they persecuted they
[1:06:41] they talked about it they wanted to kill
[1:06:43] Paul and Barnabas
[1:06:47] were they not Jews were they not the
[1:06:49] religious Church Gods or whatever
[1:06:52] yeah but they couldn't they couldn't
[1:06:54] receive the word
[1:06:56] why because it was new to their ears
[1:06:59] and anything new to us
[1:07:02] I can't believe that but if you have if
[1:07:06] you ordained to eternal life something
[1:07:08] in you said I believe it
[1:07:10] it's got to be that that that that that
[1:07:13] that that firm desired that's something
[1:07:15] not inside your bones it says I believe
[1:07:18] it
[1:07:19] um Romans 8 I gotta move on I I know I'm
[1:07:22] behind time now Romans 8 and 14.
[1:07:27] it says for as many as the led by the
[1:07:30] spirit of God they are the what
[1:07:32] sons of God for ye have not received the
[1:07:35] spirit of bondage again to fear but ye
[1:07:38] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:07:40] whereby we cry what
[1:07:43] father the spirit itself witness with
[1:07:46] our spirit
[1:07:47] uh
[1:07:48] excuse me
[1:07:50] the spirit is said that
[1:07:52] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:07:55] what
[1:07:57] now if the spirit don't bear witness
[1:07:59] that you you are a son or daughter God
[1:08:01] you're children of God then what what's
[1:08:04] what's going on it's got to be something
[1:08:06] inside your bad Witness
[1:08:09] amen you know I wrote some diners and
[1:08:12] then prayer this morning I wrote
[1:08:13] something down uh depression pressure
[1:08:16] pressure
[1:08:17] will cause what's in you to come out of
[1:08:20] you
[1:08:23] pressure wood
[1:08:25] you saw yourself some folks I didn't
[1:08:27] mean to curse yes you did
[1:08:29] it was in you
[1:08:32] I didn't mean to slap you it was in you
[1:08:40] it just shows you you might have a gross
[1:08:43] a growth spurt
[1:08:46] where you need to grow
[1:08:50] you might need to get some of that stuff
[1:08:52] out of you that's in you and God allows
[1:08:54] you to do certain things to show that
[1:08:57] it's something in you the need to get
[1:08:58] out of you
[1:09:01] are you up man so a lot of things that's
[1:09:04] in us that we think that way I got the

[1:13:50] with Christ
[1:13:52] if so be
[1:13:53] that we suffer with him that we
[1:13:57] may be also what
[1:14:01] glorified together for I reckon that the

[1:17:43] the sovereign
[1:17:45] choice of God

[1:17:51] God's Sovereign is sovereign
[1:17:55] he can do what he wants
[1:17:57] he said in Romans 9
[1:18:00] it had not the part of power to claim
[1:18:03] make one best of the heart and one to
[1:18:04] this island
[1:18:06] can God do what he wants
[1:18:09] and you question why you did that God

[1:18:18] search you that's why you wouldn't have
[1:18:19] named eternal life

[1:18:32] thing they say and only saying the
[1:18:34] things that their father said

[1:18:42] devil is a liar and they would actually
[1:18:44] speak the things that their father said
[1:18:46] they were always trying ain't not to be
[1:18:49] like God but they won't receive the
[1:18:52] spirit of God
[1:18:54] Judas amen he was one under 12 but he
[1:18:57] was the son of prediction

[1:19:04] Pentecost and receive the baptism of the
[1:19:06] Holy Ghost neither the these that amen
[1:19:09] are not the day to eternal life have

[1:23:18] are you with me what I I'ma close with
[1:23:20] this verse Lords really uh first Peter
[1:23:24] 1 and 18. I'm gonna read this portion
[1:23:29] first Peter
[1:23:32] I'm rejoicing in in the whole program
[1:23:34] glory of God
[1:23:37] it's a lot of things
[1:23:40] election
[1:23:42] is therefore according to full knowledge
[1:23:46] God has elected us
[1:23:48] we are the elect we are chosen
[1:23:52] but election is according to full
[1:23:54] knowledge
[1:23:57] and full knowledge
[1:23:59] is according to the election
[1:24:02] God
[1:24:04] is I'm not science
[1:24:07] he knows everything
[1:24:09] the Bible tells us he knows the end from
[1:24:12] what
[1:24:13] so the choices that you make by full
[1:24:16] knowledge regarding men are all knowing
[1:24:19] he knew
[1:24:21] what you would be before you were ever
[1:24:23] born
[1:24:24] and he knew your choices
[1:24:26] that you would make
[1:24:28] so he could speak in the Bible before uh
[1:24:31] Jacob and Esau was ever born said Jacob
[1:24:34] have I loved Esau have I hated
[1:24:36] because he knew the actions that Esau
[1:24:39] was going to take
[1:24:41] and God knows your thoughts
[1:24:43] and the actions in the tents of your
[1:24:46] heart God know what your heart want to
[1:24:48] do
[1:24:49] he know exactly what you got in your
[1:24:51] mind your intent of your heart he knows
[1:24:54] exactly because he's the word of God he
[1:24:56] knows your thoughts and intent of your
[1:24:57] heart he knows exactly what you want to
[1:25:00] do
[1:25:01] and you can't hide it from God
[1:25:04] are you with me
[1:25:06] so if you don't you don't intend to do
[1:25:08] right don't you think you're gonna get
[1:25:10] by
[1:25:12] and you so smart I I I I don't have to
[1:25:16] comply with your word God knows you
[1:25:18] already don't worry about a thing you
[1:25:20] wouldn't have tank ordained the eternal
[1:25:21] life anyway so God ain't worried about
[1:25:23] that
[1:25:25] God still he's still in control but if
[1:25:27] you're a danger eternal life it's
[1:25:29] something not inside you that harmless
[1:25:31] and thirst for God yes you might have a
[1:25:34] lot of things blocking you a lot of
[1:25:36] things knocking you a lot of things
[1:25:38] against you but not in your heart
[1:25:40] there's a yearning there's a desire I
[1:25:42] want to be a Christian I want to live
[1:25:44] for God God I know that you chose me
[1:25:47] that I oh Lord there's something about
[1:25:50] that ain't nothing nothing that you've
[1:25:52] done it's just something that's inside
[1:25:54] of you and God knew that
[1:25:56] God knew that you would have a desire
[1:25:58] and a Walter and a will to please him
[1:26:02] God knew that
[1:26:04] amen and you don't have to explain that
[1:26:06] to nobody else but God knows your heart
[1:26:10] he knows your desire
[1:26:13] and he knows when you say well God I
[1:26:15] want to go out there in the world and I
[1:26:17] want to hear the word and Lord I want to
