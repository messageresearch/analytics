in the ministry full-time now for 18 years but i've been preaching since i was 14 and i also celebrated 30 years of ministry this june it's hard to believe it's been that many years passed by but i've been uh at least one time around the world in evangelism and and uh and so happy to be in south carolina i uh i know gene williams and with isaiah brooks and some of the brethren that come from the assembly here many years ago um i started preaching for isaiah when i was 15 as a matter of fact the lima when he first went up north and i had always heard of brother simmons always heard of brother simmons henry simmons brother simmons brother simmons i told the lord a number of years ago i said one of these days i want to meet that man amen hallelujah and so here we are and i appreciate god letting us come together like this amen i appreciate the lord that way and it's just wonderful and i appreciate uh the desire of god allow us to come by here and maybe share a little something with you that might help you along the way so we appreciate you amen attending the service this morning i know with uh all of the little things and situations going around the world sometimes it makes people a little timid but if perhaps you are at home because maybe you're protecting yourself or trying to be wise where your family is concerned for those of you that are streaming i want to say god bless you as well and for those that get the service later on may the lord bless you as well we appreciate god's grace to us and his mercy i would ask that you would pray for me as i travel i am full-time in the ministry and we have a full schedule for the rest of the year coming god's willing we're going to try to get back over to the congo at some point also other places calling different parts of the world virtual meetings are being set up to preach in other lands as well and uh i would just solicit your prayers for those meetings coming and for the norad family and by the way i noticed a little hesitation on that no rod it's normal i'm going to help you say my last name i couldn't have been a priest in the old testament because i ain't got no rod [Laughter] that'll help you a little bit amen but pray for us and pray for our family if you will we just trust that the lord will just bless you in return and that's not a pull for money now that's just i want your prayers and

bless his holy name amen and bless the lord o my soul forget not all of its benefits amen if you got your bible stand with me what a privilege it is to be in the house of god we love the lord with all of our hearts today matthew chapter 5 if you've got your bible just appreciate god's grace to us you know when i was a boy i was raised in a little church that had later at some point become what they call return ministry in other words one day brother ram's gonna come back set up a tent speak us in resurrection and things and for many years our pastor never really revealed it until about the time we got married 1998 and i received the holy ghost in 91 when i got born again these message folk come around and said give him time he'll quieten down he'll settle down a little bit i'll get a little age on him and he'll slow down a little them wet blankets have been trying to put my fire out for 30 years and it ain't getting worse it's getting stronger now you got to understand something about type church we come from you didn't amen you didn't clap your hands you didn't praise the lord you sat there twiddling your thumbs waiting on the prophet but i got news for you brother i'm glad jesus got to me before a whole lot of the rest of them did because god by his grace he helped me see what holy ghost and fire really is it ain't an emotion no i get that it ain't an emotion but it is the trueness of the holy spirit amen it is the infilling of the holy spirit if you love the lord shout amen god bless you matthew chapter five verse one thank you my brethren it's a privilege to play with you today matthew chapter five verse one and seeing the multitude now jesus is gonna go to the mountain and teach them a couple things i want you to pay attention to the way that this is worded because it's very crucial to understand the arrangements of the scripture here and he's seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and he taught them taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven let's pray over the word lord jesus what a privilege it is to be gathered here in the house of god lord i have no doubt in my mind that i am amongst the company of saints of god for lord jesus as we stand here in divine presence lord these folks around here the feeling that's reverberating around us these aren't hitchhikers they're not just people that just coming along for a ride and hopefully playing church as some people might think of it lord i can truly feel the movements of real christians in this place and i want to thank you for the atmosphere that's been amen presented before us today and lord god we want to ask you to come into this place hallelujah and that you would take your word and that you would speak to us expressingly lord god my lips are that yet of clay but thou art the master who speaketh and i anoint lord jesus thy word by prayer and i pray you'll anoint me with the holy spirit that i can take both and put them together by your grace to be a benefit a blessing to all of those gathered around us in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and the saints of god said amen hallelujah praise the lord glory to god thank you jesus amen amen see some folk just get that say amen in there i want it all god bless you may be seated may the lord bless you real good hallelujah now i would tell you to turn shake hands with somebody but i don't know if i'm breaking rules asking that amen you just elbow at somebody or wave at him i guess amen i i'm i'm trusting that you know that the holy spirit can help me present this in the way that he showed it to me some months ago and if god will help me i want to try to speak to you this morning on those three little words that he spoke there blessed are they now there's many things we could go in and add on to that but i just want to focus on just a little bit of this beatitude i think it'll be a blessing to us if we looked at just some of it uh maybe uh you know sometime later uh i don't know maybe if we had a couple nights in a meeting or some kind of thing you know here at the church we might be able to take more of these type of things and break them down but uh you know just having the one service i'm just gonna hit the high spots for you try to give you as many scriptures and things from the message and what more that you can study this and trust it'll be a blessing to you because i believe that the word of god has power in it how many believe that's ryan this is not just an ordinary book and i want to say something to you and those that are listening if any man would look at you and say the bible is just a book they need to understand one thing that this is the only infallible book that we have in the world there is no dictionary there's no encyclopedia there's no concordance that has been put together more perfectly than the word of the lord this bible from his as the old fellow said give her to give her amen i like that amen from the cover to the other cover give her to killer he said there's never been a book more inspired in any other book amen that is inspired by some inspiration it might have artistic or musical inspiration behind it or political inspiration but the bible said that holy men of old were inspired by the holy ghost to put together god's thoughts in god's mind down here on the pages of the bible and i believe that the word of the lord as you just read the word of the lord just the words i believe they are the words of the lord but don't forget that every word is birthed from a thought somewhere the thinking has to be there before the word can be expressed and as believing christians as bible-believing christians we understand that especially in the english language that the english words can take on different meanings and they can have different sayings and different uh understandings behind them let me give an example what i mean if i use the word board this morning b-o-a-r-d i could say the spelling of it you know right away what i'm talking about but if i just pronounced it and said board well you don't know if i'm talking about a committee board a deacon board or board like a plank board like that or as some people are in church bored amen you have to know the thought behind what it is that i'm saying in order to catch the word that i'm trying to use and i believe the bible is the same way that many times the bible will use words and wording that we might think in our our natural way of looking at it it means one thing but if you catch the inspiration behind what it really means you'll understand it's an entirely different thing than maybe what we would use in english now let me just give you an example what i'm talking about when jesus uses here blessed are the poor in spirit that word poor in our english thinking or our english words we might translate that to say no money person that is poor destitute ragged they have nothing about them that you know has any economic value or no value or wealth or just poor but really the thought behind this word is not the word poor as in not having any money but what jesus is referring to here is those that are not poor as in financially destitute but those that are empty in other words an empty vessel those that are empty amen blessed are the poor or the empty in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven so the word poor is what we would use it has a different thought behind it than what we would say oh he's poor she's poor they're poor that church is poor whatever so jesus here is referring to those that are blessed of god now let me say something to this church first before we get too deeply into the thought about blessings now i understand and you you can tell already that i enjoy worship in the lord i enjoy shouting and i enjoy good music and worship in god and and i certainly enjoyed the special this morning and i meant that was a wonderful selection i enjoyed amen the spirit of it and and i felt blessed we would say i felt blessed of the lord but i don't want you to forget that blessings of god are not just the outpouring of emotion and jesus is going to describe down through these beatitudes what the blessed are and what those blessings look like and actually when we look at what a real blessing is a real blessing has nothing to do with whether or not you felt a chill run down your back or you spoke in an unknown language or you saw a vision or whatever it might have been but the blessing of god goes a lot deeper than that as a matter of fact the blessings of the holy spirit are something amen that goes so deep into the soul that when you don't feel one thing is anybody hearing me this morning say amen amen when your flesh is dry amen in the skies are brass and you don't feel not one thing around you amen you are still blessed of god and the blessing is still following your life it's just like in divine healing when somebody comes to the platform and we lay our hands on them and we pray for them amen the blessing of that prayer because jesus said whoever you lay your hands on they shall recover amen and if they're sick in their body and we pray the prayer of faith over then the blessing of that prayer follows them around and the prophets say it this way amen whether or not in two days or three days from now a person begins to get sicker he said that don't have one thing to do amen with your faith or the prayer amen the blessing is still there no matter you feel it or whether you don't feel it oh my god i'm about to preach in just a moment but what i'm trying to tell you is that we have we have leaned too much upon the emotional side and the feeling side of religion amen i like it i enjoy it i want more of it but god almighty amen when the chips are down as they used in the world amen when all hell is breaking loose around me almighty god give me the strength and the dexterity and the foundation amen to stand right there on the promised word whether i feel it or whether i don't feel it let me have that confidence to know who i am where i came from and where i'm going amen we have a problem in our message we have a problem in the ranks of religion in general there is two classes of people there are those that despise holy godly worship sure they don't enjoy amen people getting loud they don't enjoy things like that now to me amen i don't believe every service we go to has to be a shout but i believe that the shout is there and you quench it you're displeasing the lord i've always said the person just needs to be flexible are you listening to me that if god wants you just to sit there and cry or sit there under the awe of the holy ghost and you can't hardly move a muscle amen that's just as religious of a service as if they're running the backs of the benches and shouting and hollering amen but people in this mode are often resistant to the outpouring of emotion and that's sad because without anything amen being said at all a human being is born emotional from the time they are separated from their mother's womb from the moment that they break the matrix of their mother's womb they're an emotional thing or they're a dead baby one or the other life will produce a stimulant life is a stimulant within itself and life will produce a reaction in somebody's body you know we call a person laying in a hospital bed with no responses amen they say they're brain dead but you can put a little meter on them and you can see laying in that hospital bed there's some sort of activity going on why amen life though it might be depressed though it might be amen and push down to where that the life is barely there but life will cause a reaction oh god is anybody hearing me this morning amen and why would i want to come into the gates of the holy ghost amen come into the presence of the holy ghost and stand there like a dried up old stick dead like a methodist and no understanding of what it means to worship god in spirit and in truth i'm called to be a priest that all right and what that means is priests didn't always feel like doing the service there might have been some wake up of a morning that had migraines maybe some of them didn't feel i don't know maybe we'd say on top of the mountain but yet they had a service to god whether their back was hurting whether they had sores on their feet whether or not they had a dental issue maybe their mouth was hurting or some kind of thing like that they were under obligation to go into that temple and do the works of the lord and when peter said you are a sacrament giving sacrificial lips he never spoke to us in the way of whether you felt it or whether you didn't feel it he just said you're a priest and you give sacrifice no matter what this is one reason why i believe that a true child of god can worship god if everything is going wrong if their body is hurting if they're wracked with pain amen how many of you seen on the laying on a death bed be able to raise up a little old hand and say glory to god in the highest why is it life will produce a reaction life is a stimulation and within itself it will react in some way then there are those that believe that life to be produced life as we would say what life is there's another side of the coin where some might say that life is just the output of constant emotion but i want to remind you that the sun got up this morning out of its bed from sleepy time amen and it put the moon away and when it got up in the morning it drew thousands and millions of gallons of water up into the heavens and it never made one sound oh hallelujah i meant for you to get a little quiet and listen but not dead come on now preach to me a little what i'm trying to tell you is not everything that is emotional is necessarily alive hey man we got copperheads in in tennessee you all got him here you ever killed a copperhead cut his head off he still moves and jerks and his body will quiver and carry on for hours afterwards even though he's got no head he's dead and he don't know it he's got he got reaction there's movement there but there's no life in there the life is leaving that body amen and it's producing a reaction sure but that's not the evidence of life in itself now with these two schools of thought you can see how modern day pentecost now we believe in the original pentecost but we are firmly against modern day we do not believe that we need gifts in order to have the holy ghost we do not believe that we have to see visions to be spiritual although spiritual people will see vision and spiritual people will have gifts but not everybody will have everything i'm reminded of sister florence ciccarion when brother branham had uh mentioned about her praying fasting she wanted to cast out devils she asked brother brown i i'm wanting to do it but i can't do it he said you wasn't called to it you were called to pray and fast for those who could i know we like to think that we'd like to have god pour out everything on us number one you couldn't handle it and number two you'd make a mess out of it if you got it all so would i so we just take what we get we tell our girls i've got three girls back home and they're with my mother in ohio for summer vacation as uh 14 years old should get maybe 15 october then 12 and then my baby is 6. and we tell the girls when they're little you know they like to eat you can see where they get that from amen and while they're in a restaurant or something like that we get them just a little potion we don't want them to have everything but we get them just a little bit and sit down and maybe the little baby would squall a little bit and i would say you get what you're getting you don't throw a fit amen that's the way i feel about it when it comes to the holy ghost if god chooses to bless us with things from on high we get what we get we shouldn't throw a fit we should be a blessed person to know god instills in us what he wants us to have i'm going somewhere i'm just trying to get this foundation in before we get there remember jesus is teaching now on the mountain he's not preaching preaching and teaching are vastly different they're different in this regard that if i'm just preaching the gospel just preaching in general i might say get saved get born again get to holy ghost get the new birth i might use all them terms and if i'm preaching it all means the same thing but if i'm teaching there's a difference in being saved and being born again and not everybody that receives the holy ghost is necessarily born again so jesus is teaching he's entering into a form of ministry glory to god where he is going to scripturally found the manifestation of the sons of god now remember before paul can ever lay the foundation for those sons he said no other foundation could be laid which was laid jesus christ so the lord is laying down the real character glory of what a manifested son will look like now i know a lot of people in the message and and different parts of the message they got it in their brain that a manifested son of god is somebody like brother branham that that when they walk out every time they walk out the front door they're seeing a vision remember men are called to certain things men have jobs men have responsibilities men are called to those things but having gifts and divine signs and wonders is no sign your god-selected child and when we look at manifestation of sons often we will point to the spiritual outworking of gifts and things in the prophet's life when that had nothing to do with whether he was a son of god or not unless you don't believe the bible which i will remind you gifts and the calling of god are without repentance any two-faced soured-up hypocrite moss-backed demon could stand there with a priest robe on or stand there with a preacher's tie on and cast out a devil supposedly brother bam said wisdom versus faith i've seen demons speak in tongues i've seen demons shout now i have to i've seen people in churches that i knew wasn't a bit more boring again than that guitar is born again and run the aisles and shout and scream and holler and living with somebody else's husband that ain't got nothing to do with the character of jesus christ and this is what god is laying down as his character because remember the blessings he's referring to here in matthew 5 are not just rain glory to god it's not just the reign of the holy ghost something to make you feel good but this is the actual divine nature hallelujah to god of a child of god full of the holy ghost that's been born again by the holy spirit this is the very character in nature another son and daughter of god blessed are they what kind of blessing are we supposed to receive well here's the question i want to ask you how can we receive a blessing if we're not empty because remember when peter stands up on the day of pentecost and he preaches this is that that was poured out by the prophet joel don't forget that in order for something to be poured out and something to be received it has to be empty down here before it can be received it wouldn't do me no good to take this bottle of water right here and pour it into something that's already full the container must be emptied out first and there lies our problem and i don't mean just this body here but universally around the world that's the biggest problem that christians really have more than anything else they're too full you've got so much on your mind that even some of you sitting here this morning are distracted from my words because of stuff that is filling your mind up you know that goes to proof it's not that you're not a christian not that you're not born again not that you're backslid it just goes to prove you need a time to empty out this is why jesus said cast all your care on me for i care for you this is why the scripture records take upon me cast all of your burdens there because as long as we are so filled up with the nonsense of the world there is no way that we can create a container for the holy ghost and don't remember any true child of god is an absorbent for the spirit of god not a repellant [Laughter] preach brother ben i think i will right amen no individual that is truly born to the holy ghost will ever resist the power of the holy ghost amen you may not even be a shouter but if the holy ghost comes as a shout you're just welcome to it yes lord i'll do what you want me to do i've heard people say through the years i'm just a quiet person i said sure until you see your grandkids hit a baseball home run or kick the soccer ball through the net one guy said to me i've preached to him for a number of years you're always trying to get me to say amen i'm just not in a manner i said you mean you're not a shouter you're not a neighbor you're not a motive i said no i said i challenge thee brother meet me in the office in a few moments i'm going to find me a deacon or a carpenter or a trustee or somebody's got a hammer and i want you to offer up the right hand of fellowship i'm going to take said a hammer and place it on said thumb and after i whack you if you sit there quiet you are have my just my my in my specific permission to remain quiet in church but if i whack you and you squeal you're doing nothing but making a bunch of excuses because you don't want to worship god right but remember the blessing of god is not always the emotional side listen to me friends a true child of god that's got peace they have peace in the middle of a situation or circumstances or set of circumstances that is not peaceable somebody say amen if you've got joy in your heart you can have joy when everything around you is not joyous right that is the true character of a child of god they are not dictated to by what goes on around them because any real believer that's got the new birth they are the master of every circumstance that goes on around them and you realize mastering circumstances goes beyond just speaking storms back into the heavens and creating squirrels but being a master of your circumstances might be as simple as you waking up of a morning and every day you wake up that old devil tries to make you depressed and sour and you wake up one morning determined in your heart them days are over and i'm going to take this joy i'm going to take this faith i'm going to take this peace glory to god i'm going to take all of that and i'm going to apply it to my life come on somebody and when i get up this morning i put my toes on the side of the bed i'm not going to be old sourpuss walking around but i'm going to let the joy of the lord be my strength amen that is a master of circumstances it can be that easy i'm a firm believer that a sister there's a situation going on in her home she's a prayer warrior or she talks to the lord anyways and she's got god's ear i believe that little lady could be vacuuming the floor kids in this way and grandkids this way and that and all mixed up every which way and i believe she could be vacuuming the floor like this is a holy ghost striker tip that vacuum cleaner up and so i take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of god in the name of jesus christ because you're a master the blessing of your life is not whether you feel it it's being empty and letting the holy spirit fill you up being poor in spirit represents humility i'm about to get in something right now you all ready as you can tell i'm not bashful so you shouldn't be either humility is a realization that all of your gifts and blessings come from the grace of god that's where everything i get comes from so i tell my girls and my wife when i have to travel a lot and i have to be away from them they're crying for me and things i say listen i love you so much i love you so much i said don't forget you are my gifts he is my giver and i have to be in service to him you are my gifts and i i appreciate you and i love you and i honor you for what you are but he is my giver who give you to me the bible said all things come down from the father of lights in whom has no variableness of turning in other words he he ain't going to give you one thing turn around and take it back whatever god promised he'll stick with it somebody say amen hallelujah i'm about to speak another language right now whatever he promised in his word he still keep it to the very letter you don't have to be afraid of it amen i read a little thing this morning i thought was so good so when you get into a plane you relax even though you don't know who the pilot is when you're on a boat you kick your feet up and relax even though you don't know who's driving the ship amen what about a child of god amen in this life as we live let jesus drive the boat and fly the plane and just relax [Music] hallelujah let him take control of the whole situation yes being empty this is god's gifts to have poverty of spirit means to be completely empty and open to the word of god now you and i may not ever understand everything this book says but i remain open for the lord's interpretation i may not receive every interpretation that's given to me i may not receive every interpretation that is preached to me or somebody that tries to translate it to me or interpret to me what it means but if the lord wants to show me something even though it may take years before i get there i remain open for him to show me and brother sister therein lies the key of revelation if you want the holy spirit to reveal something to you out of your bible you just keep reading you just keep praying and don't forget the main important part remain open because there's many people that will read this book they will read this bible right here and not be open to what it has to say well if it be that way if that's the reason of it then tell me how come women still cut their hair there's bibles in every hotel room around this nation any of them can open up to first corinthians and reaper paul says it's a shameful woman to do such a thing why they still do it and i say this in the utmost respects when i was in africa some of our precious black sisters is that okay i they come to me they said well brother ben we got to trim the ends of it in order for it to grow out and be long i said you don't understand the message then because i said the prophet of god was asked a question about what long hair was and he never gave a description of the link 12 inches 14 inches that has nothing to do with long hair it's long when it's uncut when you don't put scissors in it or trim it off with fingernail clippers or burn it off with a curling iron or whatever some people do to get out of the side step the drill reality of the bible whoa getting quiet in here well if your sisters don't cut your hair you ought to be screaming amen sure the point i'm trying to make to you is i'm not trying to divert into a holiness scheme i'm not trying to bear down on you and put a spotlight make you feel bad what i'm trying to say to you is that if we are open to the word of the lord when we read the word there'll be something in us that will say help me understand it lord praise the lord god bless you brother i needed that amen right now he felt what i'm feeling if there's an openness to scripture and when they hear it read they'll say yes lord yea and amen to the word of god why is there such a resistance listen people are too full they're too full of theology they're too full of understanding from others they're too full of this that and the other and i believe with all of my heart that the people around the ranks of this message have come into a different stage they're in a different realm than the rest of the people around this world and i'll tell you why i believe that people have come into such a position to where they themselves have become their own absolute and such people will wind up in the tribulation period and wind up in hell because they believe their opinion is the sayeth the lord i got news for you brother be it a preacher be it a a monarch a potent tape being a schoolboy or schoolgirl amen let every man's word be alive and let god's be the truth i don't care how studied he is or how long it's been around truth or how long has preached or what kind of a big ministry he's got if he leaves that bible you leave it don't touch it leave it alone right i'm open that's what being empty simply means is to be open and receptive now you arm folders in here don't i'm not picking on you okay but you know when people come to the house of the lord and they just sit you understand what i mean and not that they're not listening not that they're not absorbing but i mean that resistant hard spirit i don't care what you read them or what you tell them you could take it right out of the bible take it right out of the message of the hour the holy ghost could come right back around behind that and confirm everything you're saying and they sit there and look at you like a mule staring at a new gate resistant to the spirit of god not interested in what anybody's got to say well there ain't no preacher going to tell me what to do well somebody's telling you what to do and if it ain't a preacher remember it is a preacher because satan was the one that preached in the beginning preached to the angels he preached to eve he's got a whole ministry team down here on the earth that's what paul said [Laughter] well i've enjoyed my time here with you brother simmons it's been good while it lasted come on now don't get quiet on me so i know we don't like to think of things like that but it is true satan has a great influence in the realms of religion don't forget in revelation 12 the entire world is deceived except for those whose names were on god's book before the foundation of the world hallelujah so if my name was on the lamb's book of life i cannot be deceived what are you afraid of then bring on all of the scandal bring on the false doctrine bring on the lies amen my soul my womb is stopped up i cannot receive anything that is falsely against the word falsely thus saith the lord if i'm a child of god the very evidence that i've got his holy ghost is that i'm open to his word this is what brother branham was trying to get us to understand when he said believing the message that term we've thrown that thing around until everybody's a believer and i got news brother forgive me for signing straight forgive me for signing harsh forgive me for sounding rude but you nor me or anybody else is a believer until god himself has come down and confirmed your faith with the seal of the holy ghost and said yes they are a believer because remember church remember little bride it's not when you accept the holy ghost it's when the holy ghost accepts you takes the power right out of our hands so the only thing we have left to do be empty praise god listen to this in perfect strength my perfect weakness brother said that's god's strategy to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like he did at pentecost and pentecost wanted to do it took them 10 days to get all emptied up they were standing there with their vessels turned up glory that's why i want to be in church turned up when i play the piano i preach the gospel i've had many of them because of my big mouth and because of my loudness turn me down but i tell them don't turn me down turn me up i want to example what's going on in my own walk with god i ain't killed nobody yet amen but they were standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself granted lord and filled them up he said that's all they shook the world he poured himself into them praise god that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty human vessels glory to god so god can fill them up don't you understand this is why we don't have bigger revivals this is why the churches are half full this is why the preachers preach at half speed people are too full and the ministry we get fed up with it you think you get tired of us bashing on you we get tired of you not wanting to be passed on you think you get fed up with with the nonsense and this side the other and we stand around and we preach about people not coming to church not paying their tithes not paying their offerings not loving one another and you get i wish he would shut up we wish you'd pay your tithe and offer to love one another see i'm preaching on ties and offerings i'm no pastor i can get away with it the point i'm making to you friends is we're too full we're too filled up with things when we come to the house of the lord and the man of god has spent his time absorbing that shekinah it comes out under the anointing of the dew of his ministry and he steps behind the platform he's ready to bring and there's nothing more frustrating than preaching to a bunch of people that are not ready to receive that their vessels are not turned up you know it's kind of like when you go to some of these specialty restaurants they have all of the silverware and the cutlery and everything laying on the table and if you've never been to one of these places generally what they do is when they aren't serving anybody they take everything turn it upside down that's the sanitation to keep things from falling in the cups and some waiter running by and a french fry fall off or some little dot or dollop or something it's a respectful thing to the guests to prove to them we are not ready to serve until you arrive and then when you sit down the way to the waitress they'll come up they'll start flipping everything over they'll turn them up because it's time for you to eat how often does a preacher come to the house of god and looks out across the congregation and there's cups turned upside down and plates flipped over not ready to receive what's being served by the lord then my precious friend in that situation if you walk out of the house being discouraged and you walk out of the church house feeling like you didn't get nothing take a look and see if you ever turned your cup up or not ask yourself was my plate ready to be filled or was it already full was something that the pastor of the evangelist or the teacher of the apostle prophet could not get to you because it was already filled up remember this is the reason that israel had become such a stench in the nostril of god listen at his words all of the tables are full of vomit how could god set down a seven course revelation how could he set down the blessings of the holy ghost the understanding of the godhead water baptism how could he have laid that on israel when they were so full that when jesus arrived they refused to believe he was who he said he was we know who you are you know what you're all about your mother had an affair with a roman soldier and you're trying to cover it up with something spiritual that's history they actually mentioned when they said we not be born in fornication that's what they're referring to it was wrote in history that they did not believe that mary was virgin some people still got that idea when i was going to school some years back i was in a debate with a fellow by the name of dr terry meath and dr mead if he ever hears this he's a personal friend of mine but he's a he's a real theologian well we had entered into a discussion about the that the humanity of christ and later on he sent me some remarks his letterhead was that all the way across it with abbreviated doctor's degrees and i thought who in the world did i lock horns with we were talking one day and he said to me he called me ben we were we were friendly like that i'd call him dr me that i respect and he said to me ben he said you claim that jesus christ had no part of the human system i said he didn't then tell me he said where did he get his humanity from if not from mary and not from joseph i sat there a moment and i thought lord you said take no thought when you come before men like this and before i could even speak i heard the holy spirit say it out of my mouth where did adam get his from [Laughter] praise god god was the father and god was the mother and when jesus stood there before him in the flesh his blood was not mingled with this serpent-seed affair don't forget of all of the animals that jesus could have chosen to identify when he would say you generation of why didn't he say brother simmons why didn't he say you generation of zebras you generation of rhinoceros out of all of the animals that jesus could have chosen to identify them pharisees with why did he call them vipers and snakes why did john tell him you're nothing but a bunch of vipers in the wilderness because that was where the original sin happened it was a serpent in the garden of eden whose later was changed and put on his belly as a snake sure jesus standing there his his blood the very blood cell was created by god oh you said but mary mary put yes she she pumped into that blood cell the vitamins to bring it to birth but the very creation of the blood cell has nothing to do with the food that is received because remember cell upon cell upon cell precept upon precept that builds itself the life was god's life are you with me say amen and when jesus stood there the holy virgin-born son of god he wept over jerusalem why why listen to me why did jesus weep over jerusalem because he come to a bunch of people that were full and couldn't receive not one blessing of god remember when he went into the city and said many great things he could not do because of their unbelief you see their unbelief had so clouded them until they could not be open to receive any blessing that jesus could give but he could walk right down to the well side where there was a prostitute standing there and she was wide open just like that well glory to god we know when messiah cometh he'll tell us he said why she wasn't standing filled up full of a bunch of theology she wasn't filled up on her own self-conceit oh well i'm a i'm a believer i'm a jew i'm a this i'm a just like people today well i was in this message before you was born well so was the devil what's that got to do with anything let a man tell me one time many years ago i'll have you know he called me benjamin you know that was to put a little sting on it have you know benjamin that i sat in the tabernacle with the prophet i said right next to the devil i said because the the most faithful member brother branham ever had was the devil he was in every convention he was in every revival he was in every church service i said when other people would miss satan was right there on the front row don't ever think he wasn't come on out that ain't got nothing to do with whether or not a person is going to be spiritual or not it's how open they are they tell me that after the squirrels were created that they were sitting around the table and some of those brethren that were there had told this now this is just table talk but take it for what it's worth but they said it when brother was talking about them squirrels they thought he was just telling a story and they were laughing cutting up and laughing with brother brother and they didn't take him too seriously when he talked that way but i said all at once that's when hattie walked in there and said that ain't nothing but the truth brother branham what i'm trying to tell you friends is that we can be sitting right in the middle of god himself not that brother brahma's god don't take it that way but we can be sitting right in the middle of the holy spirit himself sitting right in the middle of the presence of god and if we're not open he can't do nothing for us blessed are they blessed are they that can receive blessed are the empty can i go a bit further thank you no need to worry two more hours we're good jesus said in matthew 5 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven remember the kingdom of heaven is not meat or drink but joy peace consolation in the holy ghost therefore if i am empty then i can receive the kingdom even jesus said it he made the statement very plainly when they said well where is he going to be at he said no don't look in the desert if they say here they say there you see people are still in that quandary today they still don't know where to identify god you will never find god hanging between the cherubims you will never find god sitting on a soapbox in heaven deity is with man and sister you're a part of that because every time the bible if you'll notice the bible always mention men very rarely mention women that's because you are the rib to some man somewhere and the blessing that comes from him is the same lesson that applies to you that there be no schism in the body of christ come on come on preach to me sometimes women can be more spiritual you're not left out of this sister oh you say they can't oh i know brother i felt that you hercules guys in here tell me i'll remind you who was it that came to pilate saying don't fool with this man jesus it was his wife you know why she was more open where god could deal with her glory to god words amen in case some of y'all forgot it right oh praise the lord we don't want that rutted place though david said i would rather be a doorman at the house of god but we don't want the doormat we we don't want to become the lowest of the low and the lowly of all lowlys we don't want to become a doormat that people can rub their feet on us that people can work on us all right doormat testify talk to us this morning you're a part of the kingdom of god tell me what you're worth nobody ever sees me nobody ever honors me nobody ever pays attention to me until they're wiping their feet on me but to be empty though i may not be called to that i've got to be willing to become some of y'all didn't hear me this morning let me say it again to you i may not be called to be a doormat but i must be willing hallelujah come on now preach to me for a little while amen i must be willing to become the lowest of all if i'm not willing to become that then god can never exalt me to that praise god some people are so against this kind of preaching of course because we have this elitist mentality we are in the message well good for you what do you want a cookie star a gold star a trophy you get a trophy put this right here this is what god wants to see is your willingness here don't forget the ma the man that quoted this was king david a man after god's own heart said i'd rather be this spoiler as the world calls it you know when they tell you the end of a movie they say it's a spoiler spoiler the reason david was a king is because he was willing to become that all but you say brother ben there ain't no way in the world i'd ever become like that right there and that's the reason you don't get nowhere i don't know you i'm just preaching okay don't get mad at me but the holy spirit's got your address he knows where you live at so if he's hitting you then you say all right lord thank you yeah please don't kill the messenger this is my first time give me mercy somehow let me get through this all right notice we don't have to be so much poor in money but poor in spirit now now here's something i want to i want to want to relate to you god help me say this right but in my travels in different parts of the world there isn't a presumption an assumption if you will that poor people are spiritual people we have instances in the bible we have lazarus laying at the gate we have the rich man that wouldn't go in and so the idea of the attitude is is that if we're poor ergo we are spiritual i'm about to say something i realize where i'm at and it's on the internet and all this i i'm not ashamed of this remark ain't the first time i've said this publicly but not just because somebody is poor don't make them open amen because a lot of times we'll say you know we have people around the ranks that will say things like well if a man's got an education must be of the devil somebody said to me one time educations have the devil the prophet said so i said brother branham was not talking about being educated in terms of having an education or having a trade he was talking about people using such things to figure god out man said well a man shouldn't have any education i said then quit eating and quit walking because somebody educated you on how to do both it's this mentality that has kept our churches like charity cases people have no degrees they have no trades they have no skills and they sit there in the church destitute and poor they have no education they can barely read if that's your state of life your station i'm not throwing off on you but when a person can do better and better themselves and better their families don't thank yourself as being less spiritual because you decide to get an education or because you decide to i mean i know i know a certain individual that i had went to school with myself many years ago he was 81 years old and decided to return to college and the poor fella had been out of high school for so many years they didn't even call it high school he had to learn all over again how to learn but that didn't make the man closer to the devil and further away from god because you see when we come to any other age in paul's day they were poor in jesus day they were poor down through the church ages they were poor but when you come to lady osea the environment the culture is completely the opposite because some of you folk in here that would consider yourself poor you're rich compared to some of the people i've preached to you've got shoes on your feet you've got electricity in your house i preached to them where they didn't even have a pair of shoes now does that make those people more spiritual than you of course not because some of them same people are some of the most hard-headed people i've ever worked with glory i may end up having to preach and amen all at the same time before this thing's over with now just follow my thoughts here for a moment because what we have to understand when we come to the ladies and age it is an age of the abundance of earthly goods where often the criteria if you will or the gauge or the measuring stick of spirituality is how much money you've got you know that people will judge you based on what kind of car you drive judge you based on what kind of clothes you wear they'll judge a pastor based on the condition of the look of his church if you go to a place that's kind of run down a little wore out don't tell me you don't walk in there look around all them little spots and digs and dings and stuff around on the and think to yourself good night don't they have money for a bucket of paint huh and the quieter they get the harder i preach right because we get it in our mind that poor and wealth are criteria of how spiritual you are and none of that is true at all now is it true that it's hard for a wealthy man to make it into heaven jesus said so he that has riches like that it's hard for him to do it why because of the influences that surround him but brother don't be deceived the poor folk that i preached to in my lifetime they have spent many many a night surrounded by atheists bank robbers drug addicts people that would hate the very name of god surrounds them and tries to keep them from going to church but one reason it's harder for a rich person amen to move into that mode of being touched by the lord it's because the attitude is i don't need anything ah what happens if a poor person gets that mentality you know i've heard people say i've got everything i need right here what about god still need him because if you are flat broke and you have that ladies and attitude you will go to hell just as quickly as the millionaire will as a penny heir will go just as quickly as a millionaire will whoa amen the bible didn't say money was the root of all evil it said the love of it and love will produce an attitude i've seen people in churches they are so stingy they pull the hairs off of george washington dropping a dollar into the offering my father-in-law used to say they squeezed the nickel so tight the buffalo begs the indian to shoot it amen not trying to be funny but such a stinginess such a an attitude oh i ain't going to do that and you will not put a dollar in church and then turn right around and go out and pay 25 at mcdonald's for a sack of hamburgers see attitude again my point is we're too full we're filled up full of all of these things if ain't none of y'all been praying you're praying god let that preacher quit before he digs any deeper [Laughter] when i start feeling like that i know i am right where i belong i'm digging in the right tater patch yes sir look here matthew chapter 12 verse 43 and 44 when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished now listen what i'm going to say don't misunderstand me i believe we should receive the holy ghost if we are called to receive the holy ghost but listen careful the foolish virgin go out of this world swept and garnished and clean but not filled now i'm not advocating that any of us should accept anything less than what god would have for us but if in the in the scope or the canon of my life if all i could do in the very end was just remain empty i'd rather have that than have the world fill me up full of pleasures and everything else i know i know that gets down to a place we don't like to think of it i would rather remain empty even if it meant that god would not fill me with the holy ghost i would rather remain empty because that would at least be a sign of my faith toward him that even though i may not be able to receive the holy ghost i'm not going to let the devil occupy me either i'll remain virgin to you in luke chapter 1 verse 46 and 53 those two verses mary said my soul doth magnify the lord he hath filled the hungry with good things amen now i know a lot about eating you all don't have to say amen i get it you're with me i learned one thing about true hunger hunger in my stomach like i feel right now is the evidence that i am empty and i need to be filled blessed are they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled you can't be hungry if you're full oh you listen to me say amen proverbs 16 19 better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud proverbs 29 23 a man's pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit a couple more things we're going to quit humility is an aspect of christianity that we still have not got worked out yet because humility in our mind's eye is the way we dress the way we speak and our behavior that is not humility humility has nothing to do with the outward actions of your body no it doesn't because you take all of those humble people that are in a catholic convent right now praying on concrete the action of their body is in the most lowest of piety that is not humility that might be humbling themselves in a manner but that is not godly gospel humility don't forget gospel bible words have different meanings than the definitions we put to them but true humility and again sister it's more than just the length of your hair brothers whether you don't wear shorts and these type of things but true gospel humility are you listen is remaining empty and remaining sensitive for the lord's leading if you are open to the word if god tells some of you boys don't go running around here with a pair of shorts on what you shouldn't then you're open to that all right lord no problem now i'm going to use simple little examples to get a point across don't get hung up on it okay if god tells a man don't cheat your taxes you're open to what the lord says about it and you will respond accordingly not everything that has a long dress and long hair necessarily has a full heart and not everything that wears a suit and tie and packs a bible is necessarily godly and full of the holy oh you're ghost about my daddy i'm talking about whoever it is oh you're talking about preacher so-and-so i don't care what their name is or who she is humility is not the behavior of how we dress on the outside if it be that way then the amish have got all of us beat you know my wife i don't know what this thing has been but you know for the last three weeks we keep running into amish people who smoke that's the craziest thing i ever saw in my life my wife was just we was in ohio and there was a bunch of them standing outside of a van and these men just puffing away like freight trains just a few days ago she was in line getting some paying for some gas and there was an amish man standing there getting buying tobacco i never seen such as that i thought lord if we've slipped or the amish are smoking now we hadn't been a worse shape than i thought but if it's the attitude or the outside or the behavior on the outside if that's what humility is don't misunderstand me now but the devil's got every one of us be cause satan knows how to impersonate every bit of that therefore true humility is not what we do on the outside now you're saying brother ben we shouldn't live holy if you listen to the entire statement again i think you'll be able to pick out that it's not that way because let me repeat it one more time to make it clear for those here online that hear let's make this very clear true humility is being open to respond to what god said right if god said don't cuss or don't lie or don't cheat you're open you may not master it but you're open god help me you might have a little besetting sin like paul said that you fight on a daily basis but you're open god help me live right help me live holy and as a result i believe you will right well it's what it looks like on the outside oh i figured that would come all right here we go so what are we going to do about the woman then sitting at the tabernacle this is on tape who brother branham identified as a babe in christ sitting on the piano with a short dress cut hair and makeup on her face and the people were pitching a fit about it and you know what brother bram said leave her alone she is a baby in christ you know why because jesus said when he the spirit of truth has come he will reprove the world of righteousness so when the holy ghost comes into an individual he will start doing the correcting and the straightening out in your life and brother branham knew that that woman had truly received the holy ghost and it was only a matter of time before she started lining up step by step by step by step but some of us around the message we would have had heart failure if we would come into a church and see somebody in that condition we would it goes to prove our understanding of humility is not as mature as it needs to be [Laughter] well you ain't no special group everybody i've preached to thus far has reacted the same ways don't think yourself odd or strange but the reason i preach this way is because brother we need to understand these things we need to understand what true humility is not everything that packs the bible and says brother ramsey's name is a christian that's like one fellow i was sitting in a service one time and he said let me prove to you got the holy ghost my wife and i were sitting in the back of the church we'd come in a little bit late because i i knew the pastor well i didn't want to put pressure on him make him feel like he had to ask me to preach or something like that so i slipped in the back and i was sitting down and thankfully this other speaker was there and this fellow said let me prove to you got the holy ghost and he he said how many in here believes god sent a prophet put your hand up all right now i want you to help me do this all right you believe brother man was a prophet put your hand up like this all right now i'm going to answer one more thing i said to my wife every devil in hell is raising their hand too do you realize that the devil don't even believe his own trinitarian doctrine because the bible said he believes in one god and he trembles he knows there ain't no three sitting up there come on church he knows he's won oh i believe brother is a prophet so does the devil yeah a little further in matthew chapter 18 verse 4 whosoever thou shalt shall humble himself as this little child the same as the greatest in the kingdom of heaven [Laughter] here comes all these big preachers peter and james and john all of them they just got their chest stuck out who's the greatest in here lord jesus looks around come here little boy [Laughter] he takes that little fella and goes right here's the greatest could you imagine them big shot preachers judas and all them standing right there thought he was a hot shot anyway and saw that little boy standing there i imagine they probably thought about like i thought when i threw that door mat up there i like you all thought that that's what god wants us to become but remember the way up and the way down yeah matthew 23 12 whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted james chapter four verse six and verse ten not through now but those two verses six and ten he giveth more grace wherever we say if god resisteth the proud but gives grace to the humble humble yourselves in the sight of god he shall lift you up how do you how do you do that become empty brother brain gives us a great example that when he tells us in voice of the sign go into a place and pray until all the other voices are quiet pray until just like in jerusalem how long lord until you'll know when it arrives somebody asked me just the other day how do you know you have the holy ghost i said if you are even asking me that you don't have it because no man or no woman that's ever met god can ever deny the meeting of the lord jesus christ he has an influence on your life now i don't mean some of you that have come along and you've been baptized and you're doubting your experience and the devil's trying to throw you off the trail and but even you folk that would come back afterwards and maybe you would say i just don't know if i got it or not even you if you've got anything at all can point back to a time in your life to where almighty god met you at some place just because you don't have the confidence of your experience don't mean you didn't have the experience right now turn turn with me to this one i want you to read this with me romans chapter 1 verse 28 last scripture we quit we quit and we quit and we couldn't don't get it on your mind that we couldn't but we quit in first peter 5 and 5 he said likewise younger submit yourself to the elder all of you be subject to one another one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble therefore humble yourselves therefor unto the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time romans chapter 1 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient all right how he's got the bible open raise your hand look at the next two words being filled and that in itself is self-explanatory this is the reason god turned these people over to a reprobate mind not that god didn't want to help them not that the lord didn't want to reach his hands out and do something for him not that the lord jesus didn't have a desire to take his heart and pour it into their life i wish people would get this out of their mind that the holy spirit is some kind of a dictator waiting for you to make one mistake so he can bam hit you with a lightning bolt and send you to hell if we only knew the long-suffering and the true grace of god for each and every one of us me included amen we would be shining the roof off this place knowing how patient he's been with us he's never been angry for keeps though his anger would endure for a little while though it lasts for a little while joy comes in the morning this is the reason god turned these people over to a reprobate mine if satan's trying to tell some of you sitting here this morning i will never be anything more than what i am i'm a loser i'm worthless i'm no good i'm sorry god's probably already dismissed me and got rid of me and i'm done the only reason he would do such a thing is if you were filled with other things and wouldn't let him have entrance when he come to the door of his own church in ladies he wasn't allowed occupancy why someone else was already occupying it if christ was on the outside please somebody tell me who was on the inside satan the god of this world had already blinded their eyes and they shut him out message people i want to say something to you though this is our first meeting and i'm i'm getting pretty common with you already i guess pretty pretty down to earth but please listen to me if i found favor with you in a little bit please listen to my next words if we're not careful our have need of nothing attitude is going to put us in a place so we're going to shut christ completely ahead of our lives and out of our churches it already is now that you're not even considered a message preacher unless you're throwing brother rams name around a thousand times that'll make you a message preacher that makes you being able to read hello oh glory to god i'm a i'm a believer of the message yeah but as god said you are as you've indicated it with the baptism of the holy ghost if he hasn't then you're still too full yeah boasters haters backbiters three messages i want to read one line in pride he said my subject tonight is pride what a cursed thing so awful so evil he says his pride again unwelcome christ what a horrible curse pride is queen of the south you see what pride and selfishness does it shuts you out from the kingdom of god lord jesus how many people have we seen depart our ranks for that very reason right there we become so arrogant and so prideful we think we've got the cat by the tail as the expression goes but we don't know that god is the only one that gives us the strength to know thus saith the lord if i've learned one thing in my 30 years of serving him since i've been a boy i've learned that in the times that i always thought that maybe i was holding on i found out it was him holding on to me play something brother if you don't i'm going to get out of this i'm going to keep going you keep pulling i keep preaching he's got to get me out thank you for that thank you for pulling but i want you to understand the very reason that we as christians repent it's not saying words see this is where altar calls have failed because you get people up here and they kneel down before the lord and they start saying words god i'm sorry for this i'm sorry i'm a low down scum i'm good for nothing i'm a liar i'm a whoremonger i'm y'all y'all reckon god didn't know that before you come to the altar so is repentance you having to come and remind him of what you are you mean when you were sitting in the pew and that preacher was preaching and and that dark cloud sat over top of you trying to keep you from from getting closer to the lord and the gospel coming and cast that devil away from you where you could hear truth for a moment and all of a sudden the sunlight of god permeated and hit that soul and you started responding i'm a sinner i need a savior are you trying to tell me that you didn't that god didn't know what you was when he dealt with you then why would our repentance just be a matter of words that's not repentance what they call the sinner's prayer that's just a ritual we perform let me tell you what real repentance is it's coming before his presence and it's opening up your heart and saying lord you already see what's in here and i'm opening myself up for you to clean me out of anything that is contrary to you be it my attitude be it my opinions be it my teachings be it my own honorings or my own spirits of lust or debate or whatever it might be god i'm open for you to come clean me church that's what real repentance looks like you're saying you're sorry and god forgive me for this and god forgive me for that that's wonderful don't discontinue doing that but don't say words without also accompanying it with lord clean me i'm open because i've seen people come to the altar i've worked these altars for many many years and i watch them come right up here and pray and i've seen them cry and cry and cry and then when i get down close to them and i put my hand on them and while i'm under the anointing of the holy ghost you know how this brother simmons many times you can feel whether that person's ready or not i've even pulled him off the altar and sat him down and talked to him a little while you're too close something's wrong well you're not open yet tell me what's going on with you i've had many of them say i just i'm here because i know i need to get right but i just don't think it's going to happen i said that's the reason you felt the way you felt whenever i laid my hands on you and then after talking to him a little while and quoting the bible to him a little while and explaining to him you're approaching it wrong friends if what brother brandon taught us is true about all the little doors in our heart then all we have to do and this goes for every christian and hear me included all we have to do is open up all them doors and say okay lord you have free access to every room in my heart god when you get there blessed are they that are poor in spirit praise you lord let's bow our heads just a moment i'm assuming that the majority of you here today i'm assuming the majority of you are probably already saved but that's just an assumption if there'd be somebody here this morning they'd like to say brother ben as i've heard the word go forth this morning my heart has smote me and i know i need to get right with god i know my life's not where it should be and i need to get right would you raise your hand to the lord so i might pray for you i bless you you you and you and you back there i see you yes you god bless you and you and you praise the lord [Music] let's pray together now you say brother ben what am i supposed to just be open just be open father as i pray lord jesus for these hands that were raised i'm asking that the holy ghost will meet him right there where they're sitting not that i'm against it ought to call lord but may your holy spirit i pray may you move upon each one that had their hand raised bring a change an evident change and as they open up doors lord be it in their kitchen or their living room or their bedroom or whatever they might be opening in their heart may lord you find free access to where you can go right in there and do a great work inside of their heart bless them o god i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen i'd rather have jesus more than silver or gold i'd rather have jesus can we stand to our feet this morning than [Music] silver or gold i'd rather [Music] have him [Music] than riches untold i rather have jesus than anything in this world yes amen than to be can we raise our hands to him now [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] i'd rather have jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] today if you believe that will you say amen one time i'd rather have jesus i'd rather i be faithful to his dear cause i'd rather have jesus i'd rather be called by his whole name than [Music] that behaves [Music] thank you lord i'd rather have jesus god bless your saints god bless your voice than anything this world [Music] hallelujah rather have jesus hallelujah glory to jesus i trust this morning you have allowed the word to have preeminence i trust that you receive jesus christ into your hearts for god knows exactly where we stand you didn't lift your hands and given your hearts whether it be by repentance sin whether it be by accepting him the bible says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin shall receive the gift of the holy ghost brother sister now is the day of salvation today if you were his voice not your heart god has given you an opportunity to do something about your situation take advantage of god's opportunity that he's given you today and yield with all your heart [Music] but today is the day of salvation as we bow again father we thank you again for your word today thank you for every hand that has lifted every heart that's open even those that are out on the internet lord father i pray god that there'll be a movement and a stripping of the holy ghost that will penetrate lord god every home and every heart in the name of jesus christ that you would make a difference oh in the lab that these that are open that would empty out let you fill them up father in the name of jesus may it happen may there be a manifestation of what you've spoken those that you've delivered today continue to bless our brother being lord his wife and family it's ministry lord god i pray that you're keeping god on the battlefield stretching him provided every need in the name of jesus christ but we thank you we love you we appreciate it amen love the lord this morning appreciate the word this morning god is good amen praise god [Music] praise god god is good you want prayer amen if you already got what you needed but if you want to come we're going to give you the opportunity to come if not have the caleb sing this song said i need [Music] the [Music] [Music] i [Music] lord bless lord bless me [Music] i come [Music] to [Music] i need [Music] my [Music] i need [Music] [Applause] [Music] i oh bless me now i see [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music]
