but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespass god bless you reading towards you may be seated amen i was just ministering on patience down in mullins on thursday night i was ministering on patience amen but we want to talk this morning about perfect love and a little bit of amen some things that god was dealing with us on patients amen perfect love amen and perfect faith this morning we know that love and faith they work together so we got to have perfect if we're going to have perfect faith then we need perfect love so we talk about perfect faith this morning said have faith in god amen in order to have faith in god you must know that he is god are you with me the bible says he that cometh to god must first of all believe that he that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligence seek him have faith in god perfect faith brother and sister this morning i was like i was saying in mullins you know the trine of your faith work is patient and we must be patient amen because then your patient possesses your soul and we understand that the bible teaches us the tribulation work is patient so what we go through sometimes god is saying this is how patient can have a perfect word amen so in return god is god's will for us is perfection god will for you and i is perfection now how are we gonna be perfected perfection is patience perfection is patience and patience what it does it develops character are you with me so developing character is what we are dealing with because people amen want that character god is identified by its own characteristics they want character but they don't want to suffer the bible tells us the tribulation work is patience and patient experience and experience hope and hope makers is not ashamed because the love of god is shedded abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost are you with me so we understand that we must be patient amen and patient is perfection i mean perfection is patient waiting on god and waiting for god are you with me i'm waiting on you lord amen we're just in a hurry we seem like we got to move before god i can't take it no more i can't stand and i'm uh we get all perplexed in trouble but god is developing character god is taking us to a place where he's trying to get you amen amen where you need to be because god is allowing certain things to happen in your life to bring into a place that you can understand that all things would work together to the good to them to love the lord amen we cannot amen try to bypass amen the things that we go through we're gonna have to take it with patience wait on god and wait for god amen i'm waiting on god and i'm waiting for god the lord to come amen praise god why are you going to have patience away they mean somebody said i'm going to wait till my change come amen you got to have passion to wait till your chains come even when the adversary is coming against you you're going to have to have patience to wait lord i'm waiting on you amen something bound to happen if you have passion praise god how can you have patience when you don't have faith amen when you don't have faith you see if you had faith then you have confidence you can trust you can trust in the god that's able no matter what you're going through i can trust your god because i know you're evil he's more than able to fix it for you amen you got to have it takes perfect faith and perfect faith is a revelation it's got to be revealed to you praise god are you with me perfect faith is based on forgiveness amen perfect faith is based on forgiveness see a lot of folks amen said i got faith in god but they don't amen they don't find themselves knowing how to forgive amen christ forgave us the bible said even when we were enemies in our minds by wicked work christ died for the ungodly are you a man amen we want them so good that amen but if he can forgive us we ought to be able to forgive amen one another amen and forgive amen no matter what the circumstances what the condition is if you want perfect faith it's based off of forgiveness are you but if you can't forgive then your heavenly father what won't forgive you isn't that right so we're talking about perfect faith but we want to say i have faith in god but i will not forgive amen our attitude and how we respond and react to one another is based on whether or not you've forgiven your brother you're forgiving your sister you're forgiven amen praise god you know it's something that somebody spit in your face and put a uh some thorns sticking in your skull and people are wit uh whip you and spit on you and you you could say nail nails in your hand and so forth and yet you can say i forgive you amen you think that's that's a real uh did it really happen amen if jesus did all of that and he took all of that then uh oh some things happen to us a lot of its light afflictions but to have perfect faith and then faith is based off of forgiveness it meant the bible said the captain of our salvation he was faithful amen as until faithful creator amen god was faithful amen praise god jesus was faithful in his service amen praise god and you must be faithful to god and your love for him because his love for us amen it was unconditional love he didn't love us because of what we've done uh how amen praise god how much we loved him but his love was unconditionally praise god so god loved you in spite of amen when we amen did wicked works when we were enemies in our minds and when we did the stuff we did god still died for us he still cared about us he hadn't stopped caring he hasn't stopped loving us he still loves us it's whether or not those that will they may believe that he loves you they may believe that he cares about you believe that he cares amen see some fine folk amen they put on a a false persona they meant sometimes folks don't mean it what they're doing they don't even love god like the altar praise god i tell you brothers and sisters once they meant the love of god is shedded abroad in your heart by the holy ghost amen it takes you to another place now faith is based off of faith i i just we just don't want to have any kind of faith but romans uh 10 and 17 romans 10 and 17 says how did you don't want to have just faith in anything you want to have faith in god amen i want to have faith in god faith and god and what he says amen nice says faith cometh by what and hearing what amen so then faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god i'ma tell you something it's the word of god that i want you to have faith in perfect faith in what god said god said it i can have perfect faith prophet god says you can go into the deeper things he said because of where we're at he said the church has gotten to got to be lifted lift itself in the power of god the church got to lift itself in the power of god and it says how how can the church be lifted in the power of god we're too close to the end how many believe that we're too close to the end now and i believe the church in the condition where we can teach it a little deeper deeper things and rub some of the make belief out rub some of the make believe out i believe we got to rub some of the make-believe out see sometimes we think we believe but we just make believers but we got to rub someone to make them believe out to get into something real you got to get to make believe out to get into something real see because sometimes we can uh just presume we can venture without authority we can just presume that we have it we can have the potential but we don't have the acon is the potential of the oak tree is we have potential there and we're on our way to that but until the oak tree is manifested that we don't have the oak tree as of yet we have the potential we have the econ are you with me brother and sister i'm talking about going somewhere amen into the deeper walk with god by faith amen by faith we ain't we understand that the world were framed by the word of god are you look man see we got to have faith and without faith hebrews 11 6 without faith it's impossible amen impossible the the the please god amen without faith faith is what you know you see [Music] do what you know faith is what you know amen what you see is not faith because you see it then it can't be faith because faith is the substance of things hoped for in the evidence to think what but faith is just as real as your sight see because faith is the sixth sense and it's just as real and the bible says faith is the what so faith is a substance amen faith is something that you know you got because it's a real substance it's just as real as your eyes your eyes says that that is light isn't that right now uh you know why amen that somebody tried to talk you out of it and say it's not amen then you said my sight has declined it's light amen then your faith if it's amen perfect faith if it's genuine faith amen then you can declare it and you got faith to back you up hallelujah praise god nobody can talk you out of it that is life why because i see it praise god hallelujah some things you see and you know it's real they meant something you feel and you know it's real amen some things you hear and you know what you heard amen faith has to be something that you're certain of there's no fear and there's no doubt amen perfect faith i'm walking by faith not by sight praise god faith amen is a place where christians live amen faith is a place that god says amen it's the kingdom of god amen cometh not with other vatican jesus said they said lord hear a lord there because the kingdom of god is where it's within you praise god you possess it it's real it's genuine the woman in with the issue of blood she had perfect faith she said if i can but touch the hem of his garment i believe that i'll be made whole her faith says if i can touch it the hymn of his garbage and when she did jesus respond because she had faith praise god her it's your blood was stopped right then why because she believed that she had perfect faith brother sister when you got it like the bible said you're not vengeance you're not presuming you're not vision without authority amen you have something that's genuine amen you got to roll up the unbelief house amen something that you know amen now what happens amen to many people they think they have what they don't have amen uh uh uh it's something to have a gun and you got the shells and everything there everything is that you have you know what the bullet can do the ballistics of it the power in the shell the powder you know what it can do you got it amen but until you fire amen then it's just down line dominate but once the fire get hold to the powder and blast it off amen then you see the power of it the it's in your hand it's got the power to do it amen but the f it's got to take faith to put it in action amen the disciples had power god gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power are you up man god gives you an eye the holy ghost's power but we got to have faith to operate that power the power of god is within you greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world are you with me but you got to have faith to release and activate the power it's something about jesus was with them and they couldn't cast the devil out of the man that was gassing himself down and tearing himself and casting himself in the fire father brought him to jesus said jesus can you help me amen he said if you if you can he said if you can believe then all things are what possibly isn't that right god knew what he jesus knew who he was he knew he was the word and he knew who he was as being the word he knew he had power and authority over the devil are you up man so jesus amen activated what he had praise god hallelujah he commanded that spirit and the spirit had to come out are you with me because jesus knew who he was and you as a believer got to know who you are and once you recognize and i am a believer then you have a right to say amen because i'm a believer the sign shall follow the believer the believer is not following signs but amen the signs follow the believers amen you got a lot of people that are looking and falling out if this prophet came to town this man came to die in this group that group people people joined groups they get with a certain man this man and that man and this group of people this organization not and they trust in that but genuine faith praise god amen some people identify themselves as a group as they identify themselves with a name or with the man or whatever but real genuine faith praise god i'm talking about perfect faith amen praise god christ was with him and but he said oh lord why can't he said this kind come about faster than praying amen christ was whacked him oh but things changed the one that's what him got in them things changed then amen he's just not with us but he's in us makes the difference brother they meant some church some folk got amen christ with him but they don't have christ in them amen i want christ amen once he's in you then you have the confidence amen the holy ghost in you amen that woman amen she didn't confess the holy ghost she just had perfect faith amen but it's difficult it's a little harder they meant to have perfect faith when you don't have the holy ghost in here oh you wouldn't but that woman amen was not the holy ghost said amen she said if i can put touching him of his garment are you with me so it's it's a different like you got the holy ghost in you then amen a real believer a genuine believer in god amen that got god in the inside oh yes oh yes you got the power in the inside of you but amen the church got to come to a place amen the church got to be lifted up in the power of god praise god because we're close to the end so we got to be lifted up in the power of god amen we got to recognize who we are and what we're here to do they meant to exercise the power of god are you with me we can't talk about it we got to do it amen we had enough preaching about it we got to manifest it praise god it's all right they get stirred up by an emotional lies amen we get all emotional get all anointed but still it don't move the devil are you a man praise god what is perfect faith amen perfect faith is taking god at his word god your word declared it praise god amen the devil see you coming amen he knows that he's in trouble now i i i i praise god i've had some circumstances with amen i never can't forget the young man full of demons and calling on lucifer amen but the devil said to him amen he's going to cast us out tonight praise god hallelujah amen the devil's in him he said i didn't have no control over those demons in me but he said but they told me you're going you was going to cast them out amen the devil knows amen whether you're walking in authority and you're walking in power amen there's a lot of folk preaching about something that they don't have a lot of folk talking about god that they don't realize amen they just have the potential but it's time now let's go look deeper let's go a little deeper let's let let's activate it let god be in action amen it's something about faith amen some folk if they see it they believe it amen and they're waiting until they feel it they believe it amen they're waiting amen it's not what you see or what you feel it's what the word declares amen you have confidence in the word and what it he declared in his word let's just go to uh faith amen we get faith by hearing the word of god isn't that right so romans 4 here i'm so glad that i heard one day i heard that word praise god how did you get out your sin you believed that jesus died for your sin are you with me when you heard the gospel of your salvation it was to the saving of your soul you heard that jesus died on the cross yes or you would be once you heard it you accepted it but there are many sat here in this mode that have not accepted in in in revealed form and revelated form that the god died for you jesus bled and shedding this precious blood for the forgiveness of your sin brother and sister that you can sat here amen but till it becomes real to you praise god you only presume it there's got to be something amen that speaks amen praise god you got to hear the voice of god and once you hear you got to know that it's god hallelujah once you know it's god hallelujah okay uh romans four and uh 17 for it is written i have made their father many nations before him who whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and called it those things that what calling those things to be not as what brother and sister you don't have to see it amen you can call those things that be not as though they are amen perfect faith when joshua was in the battle and the sun was going down and joshua just with perfect faith he's his son standout steel amen i need some more light praise god sometimes amen perfect faith to take a hold and it's not you speaking it's god's speaking to you amen when god would speak to you no devil in hell can hold you back amen when god said amen you can stand ashore that he'll bring it to pass hallelujah god speaking well amen nothing get whole nobody can make me doubt i know too much about it amen i come too far amen
