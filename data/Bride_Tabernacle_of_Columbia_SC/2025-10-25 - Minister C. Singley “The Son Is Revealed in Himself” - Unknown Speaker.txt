Paul asked that question one day. What is truth? Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that the word of God is truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Truth may not make you popular, but at least truth will make you honest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Genesis 1 in your Bible. Amen. Genesis 1, start reading at verse 26. Thank you, Jesus. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, over the cattle, and over all the earth, and o over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and created he them. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Male and female created he them. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, Revelation 81. Thank you, Jesus. The scripture says, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Last scripture, Luke the 17th chapter starting at verse 28. Likewise, Amen. Thank you, Jesus. I like hearing those pages turn. Amen. Amen. Jesus Christ's name. Thank you, Jesus. Luke 17 verse 28 it said likewise also as it was in the days of Lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. Amen. Amen. Our lesson tonight is the son of man revealing himself is revealing himself. Amen. Let us just brow once more Lord Jesus as we come approach you through your word. We ask you Lord Jesus first of all forgive my sins and anything done contrary to your word. Forgive the sin of your people now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless the word Lord Jesus. Oh open up the word to us once a deeper way in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you for your redemptive work that you've done for us on the cross and we accept it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Bless us now as we reproach you through the word in Jesus Christ's name we pray and we thank you. Let church say amen. &gt;&gt; Church say amen again. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen. We that the son of man is revealing himself. Amen. And we see that in the in the first scripture text scripture we read where God made man in his image. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. God said let us make man. A lot of you know um church world got that all mixed up and they use that to justify the trinity. Amen. But we know that that wasn't not wasn't three gods that he's talking to. Is that right? God was talking to the logos. He said, "Let us make man in our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fowl of the air, over the calendar, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Is that right? Amen. So, man was made in God's image. Amen. And at that time, God man was made spirit man. Amen. Because God at that time, God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is God is a spirit. And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Amen. But right there, he made made man in his image. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said male and female created he them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So Adam was actually made in the very image of God. So we know that God inside of God was male and female. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I know it's been said a lot of time that Eve was a byproduct of the creation. Amen. But Eve was actually made in the original creation in the spirit. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Cuz he God's God God made Adam in his image and in his im image of God was male and female. Amen. And he said let them have dominion. Amen. Amen. So we see that Adam and Eve Amen. Before he made Adam in a male physical body, Eve and Adam was already made in the spirit form. Amen. And we see that God, he gave them dominion. That word dominion means to subjugate. In other word, to rule and to reign, to conquer and to subdue. Amen. And we know that God Adam was made in God image. So inside of Adam was male and female spirit. Amen. Amen. So when God put Adam to sleep, then he took the rim out of Adam which was the spirit of Eve and he made the woman. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Y'all with me? Amen. Amen. We see in Genesis 5 2 5 and 8 that man became a living soul. God let a mist come up out of the ground and form man out of the dust of the ground. Breathe life breath into Adam and Adam became a living soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. Therefore, when a person die, hallelujah. And they say over them ash to ash, dust to dust, that don't pertain unto the soul. That only pertains to that body that's going in the ground. Is that right? Amen. Amen. So when they say a dust to dust, that don't mean your soul. Now, amen. Hallelujah. I'm reminded when that young rich ruler came to God, he said, "Good master, what must I do to be saved?" And he said, "Keep the commandments." He said, "I've done all the deeds from my youth." Amen. And the Lord said, "But you have one thing left yet to be done. Sell all that you have. Give to the poor. Come and follow me and you have eternal life." But the Bible say he went away sad. Amen. Because he had much riches. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And Jesus said, "How hard it would be for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of heaven." Amen. Amen. It's easier for them to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Amen. Hallelujah. But we see that as we read this on down through the scriptures, Amen. that this rich man, Amen, we follow him through the scripture. He one time he came to the point that he had a lot of goods and he went and he wanted to tear down his bones and build bigger bonds. Amen. Amen. And he built bigger bonds. And he said, "Oh my the old soul, lay back and take your ease now cuz you got much good." But this the voice came that night said, "Oh thy fool, tonight thy soul is required of thee." Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Even though he had laid up all these treasures, Amen. God required his soul at night. Amen. And the Bible say when that young when that young rich ruler the man at that time when he woke up he woke up in hell. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine him being a rich man? Amen. He had when they had his funeral. Amen. They had him laid out in the best coffin. Amen. He he probably dressed in the best clothes that he could have. Amen. Is that right? Amen. The altar will probably array with all kind of flowers. Is that right? Amen. People were singing the best song. He got up to give good testimony about this young rich brother Bruter. Amen. But while all of that was going on, all the accolades were being made. Amen. People were praising his name, that man's soul was in hell. &gt;&gt; Even though he said ash to ash, dust to dust, that only pertained to his body and not to his soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ's name. See, man became a living soul. So when we they when we die, we going somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either going to heaven or you going to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Straight forward. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we got a chance now, why God, we still got breath in our body. Is that right? Amen. We should give everything that we got to serve God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Forsake everything him. Amen. Amen. Cuz one day we going to leave this place. Amen. None of us has come here to stay. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Amen. We may stay here 100 years. Amen. But sooner or later you gone. Amen. But the thing when you leave the condition of your body is the most important part. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. So while we got a chance, excuse me. &gt;&gt; Let us take give our lives to the Lord and worship him. Amen. Forsaken everything but him. Amen. Nothing is more important than eternal life. Is that right? Nothing more important than to beat God's face in peace. Amen. Cuz God said every every knee is going to bow and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of God the father. Amen. Amen. So it's best to bow down and worship God now. Hallelujah. While you can meet his face in peace cuz one day you going to meet going to bow down and say it. Amen. And acknowledge that he is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we can meet his face in peace, do all that you can now &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we going to leave here one day. Is that right? By and by one of these mornings, we won't be here. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ. I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Also, we see in Genesis 2:18, God said it's not good that man should be alone. Amen. And why did he said that? Because God knew what it was like to be lonely. Amen. Cuz he was once Elohim, the self-existent one out there all by himself. Amen. He got lonely. Is that right? God lonely. So he began to create. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So after he then cuz before his creation he wasn't even God. He was just Elohim the selfexistent one because God means an object of worship at that time there was nothing or nobody to worship him. Amen. But after he began to create then he became God. Amen. Is that right? Amen. So everything when God did the creation everything in the in the creation had a made except Adam. Amen. And that's why he said it's not good that man should be alone. Is that right? Amen. Amen. So God created Eve for him. Amen. Not only that, he brought after God created all the animals and everything, he brought them all to Adam to name. Adam named him the cow, dog, elephant. Is that right? And God said, "That's exactly what I would name." Amen. Cuz he Adam was a God image of God made in God's own image. Amen. In other words, God Adam was a minor God here on earth. Is that right? Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. And see God formed Eve from Adam and God brought Eve even to Adam to name and he Adam called her name woman because she came out of me. Amen. Hallelujah. Then we see that God told him as he formed Adam and Eve. He said you can eat of all the trees of the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he said the day that you eat of it, you shall die. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And they did that. Amen. Amen. They ate of that tree of knowledge of good and evil. But we know that Adam was not deceived. &gt;&gt; Eve being in was deceived being into transgression. Amen. Is that right? But Adam Amen. knowing that he didn't want to lose his wife. Is that right? Adam parttook of that sin. Amen. To save Eve. Amen. Is that right? Just as the Lord Jesus Christ, he who knew no sin became sin. Amen. That we might become the righteousness of God in him. Amen. Is that God didn't know no sin, but he took our sin on him. Amen. Is that right? When he was hanging on that cross, we should have been there. Amen. Amen. But God took our sin upon him. Amen. God, he knew no sin, but he became sin. Amen. Amen. He became a liar, a dope patter. Whatever sin that there was out there. Amen. He became that on the cross. Amen. Cuz he took cuz if if he didn't, we as his bride would have been lost. Amen. Amen. But he became sin that we might might become the righteousness of God in him. Amen. Do you thank God for that? Amen. Amen. Cuz the Bible say if God will mark our iniquities, which one of us could stand? Amen. None of us could. Is that right? Amen. in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. And so man, they ate from that tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Amen. Amen. And they and death sent in. Amen. Cuz true death means to be separated from God. Amen. They died a natural death later on. Amen. Amen. But they wasn't lost. Adam and Eve wasn't lost because God killed an innocent substitute for them. God killed a innocent lamb for them. Amen. Amen. This innocent of lamb will point toward the true lamb of God who was cometh which was Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Cuz John the Baptist, he said, "Behold the lamb of God." Amen. Which take away the sins of the world. Amen. Amen. He was standing in the midst of the people and the people didn't know who he was. Amen. Hallelujah. He's still standing in the midst of people right now. People still don't know who he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Is that right? We know that God is a living word. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us because Amen. And right now God is in flesh yet once again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to claim that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. Amen. Amen. And if you are what you eat. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you eat the word of God, you become the word of God. Cuz one thing about the word of God, is that right? The word of God is a seed. And a seed got within itself transforming power. Amen. Amen. If you take the word of God, place it in an under heart. Amen. Amen. That word is going to change you into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You take a word of say a grain of corn, a seed of corn, you put it in the ground. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Amen. As the condition get right, all of a sudden you see a little green thought come out the ground. What is happening? First of all, that seed rot. Amen. And out of that rottness come life. Amen. Amen. Before we came to the word of God, our life was rotten. And we were stink. But out of that rottness and stinking came life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. The Bible said we've all had our conversation in the world. Amen. in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. But through all of that fall, through all of that rotten, through all of that stink, out came the life of Christ once we received the word of God. Is that right? Amen. Because we planted the word in our heart like David said, "Lord, let me hide thy word in our heart that I might not sin against you." And once that word get in our heart, it begin to strange us. Amen. Cuz we're washed by the waters of the word. Amen. Amen. Amen. We're taking a bath in the word. Amen. Amen. And we're washing off all the dirt. Amen. But that word has changed us. Amen. Into the very express image of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. So if you want deity in your m, welcome the word in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Welcome the word in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You may not understand it, but read it anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Plant it in your heart. Amen. Amen. Therefore, when when it's needed, the Bible say that Lord when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against you. Amen. Amen. Because that that word that's inside of you will step forward. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I love the word of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm like Job. Amen. I esteem thy word more than my necessary food. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Y'all love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Adam failed, Adam forfeited the title deed to the earth. the title deed to learn to eternal life to all the powers and promises of God. He forfeited that when he failed. Amen. Amen. And when Adam gave up the title deed for wisdom instead of faith, Satan couldn't take that that deed. Now, is that right? Satan is the god of this world. 2 Corinthians 4:4, he said, "Amen. If I was gossip, be hid to those that are lost. to whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of those that believe not. Lest the light of the glorious gospel shall shine unto them. Amen. Amen. God is Satan is a god of this world, but Satan don't own this world. Amen. Is that right? Amen. We We're living in in Satan's Eden right now. All you got to do is look around. Amen. You can see de demon spirits on people everywhere you go. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for it. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the title deed went back to the almighty to original owner. The almighty God, the El Shadai. Amen. The breasted God. Amen. Is that right? The almighty God. The breasted God. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm reminded God told a uh uh Moses, you know, after he went and spoke to Pharaoh and Pharaoh got upset, you know, and told him to take away the straw and but they still got to make the same tail of bricks. Amen. And the people got began to mumble and complain. Amen. So God told Moses, "Amen." Hallelujah. He said, "I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known." Hallelujah. Amen. He said, "By my name Jehovah, I was not known." Amen. Because Jehovah means one with his family. Hallelujah. Amen. Adam and Eve knew him as Jehovah. Amen. Because the Bible said it God would come down and fellowship with Adam and Eve in the cool of the day. Amen. Is that right? They knew him as Jehovah. But once sin came in. Amen. They lost that name. Amen. They So God had to restore that name to him. Amen. He said, "I as I said earlier, I appeared under Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name of uh all God Almighty, the blessed one, El Shadai." Amen. Amen. If you get weak, suck on the breast of Elad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; The Old and the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Is that right? If you get lonely, suck on the the breast of El Shadai. Amen. Amen. If you get short of money, suck on the breast of El Shadai. Amen. I guarantee you, he'll give you strength. Amen. Amen. He told Abraham, Amen. And say that, I'm going to visit you according to the time of life, and you shall have that son. Amen. Abraham needed some strength to bring forth. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Amen. He So he appeared unto him as a God Almighty. Amen. Amen. Abraham got received strength to bring forth that child. Amen. Even though he waited 25 years. Amen. Amen. He was able to still bring it to him. Amen. And even while he was waiting, the Bible say Abra he did not stagger. Amen. Is that right? At the promise of God through unbelief. Is that right? Amen. Amen. And God have made us exceeding g has given us exceeding great and great and exceeding promises. Everybody &gt;&gt; precious promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a promise I think about a promise we sometime we have to wait on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But wait on them. &gt;&gt; If God said it, it's amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz all the promises of God like yeah and what? Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometime we got to wait on them. &gt;&gt; Is that right? God told Abraham and Sarah that she was going to have a child. But Sarah got a little fast. She tried to produce the promise. Is that right? Amen. You can't produce the promise of God. You got to wait on it. Amen. Amen. She told Abraham to go into Hagar. Amen. Amen. And have that child and let him lay across my need and I'll claim him as mine. But that wasn't God's approp. &gt;&gt; That wasn't God appropriate way. Is that right? God told him that Sarah was going to have that child. Amen. Because through through all through Isaac, Amen. was all the world's going to be blessed. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But he wasn't actually talking about Isaac, but he was talking about the royal seed, which was the Lord Jesus Christ. All nations was going to be blessed. Amen. Y'all love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We said the title deed went back to the original owner. Amen. And it was the abstract title deed to eternal life. And the word abstract means that it was searched all the way back to the beginning. Amen. You know, when you get ready to buy a house or something, you have to do a title search. Amen. to make sure that there's not any leans or any judgments against it. Amen. Amen. So they churched this abstract title deed was searched all the way back to the beginning and there was no claim on it. Is that right? Hallelujah. Amen. And that abstract deed went to back to God and he was sitting on the throne with it in his hand. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, the deed to eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The deed to the earth. Amen. Is that right? Y'all know this is where we going to live at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? The Bible say the meek shall inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Note the legal possession that that abstract title deed to eternal life means notice to you and me that we possesses everything that Adam and Eve had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything. We got to believe that &gt;&gt; that we possess. We've been restored back to that. Is that right? To everything that Adam and Eve had. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to believe that we are more than just church people. &gt;&gt; Is that right? We are more more than just just coming to church woman of pew. Amen. Amen. We we we're here to finish that redemptive work of Christ. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Amen. That's our job. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We're more than just bench warmers, church goers. Amen. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. And we're here to finish that redemptive work of Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. We got to believe it. Amen. that we have now become the living word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've become that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. People a lot of time they said, "Lord, I want to see you." And God send one of us. &gt;&gt; And as it was when Jesus was here, he was an unrecognized God. And right now we are even God is being unrecognized. Why? Because he's in a body of flesh again. Amen. All that God was, he pulled it into Jesus Christ. All that Jesus Christ was, he has poured it into his church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why we we're more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. He's already conquerable, but we are more than conquerors. Amen. Because we're receiving the benefits of what he paid bought for us. Amen. Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ, all we got to do is write the check. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the problem is a lot of time we scared to write the check. Is that right? Amen. Amen. But see, we don't want to limit the unlimited God. Amen. The Bible say God God can do exceedingly, abundantly, more than we can even ask or think. Amen. All we got to do is ask in in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name and claim it. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Y'all love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. And see, like I said, that legal possession of the abstract title to eternal life mean that you have everything that Adam and Eve's law. Believest this. Amen. But the requirement for redemption, no man, not even Adam, he needed redemption himself, was able to fulfill that. Is that right? Amen. God's law required a kinsman redeemer. Hallelujah. And the grace of God fulfilled that kinsman redeemer uh law in what? In the person of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. He had to had to be human and born and virgin born. Is that right? The virgin birth produced that product cuz he had to be human. Is that right? Amen. Jesus, he was immaculately born as we all know. Amen. Amen. He was born without that sexual act. Amen. Amen. He was born virgin birth. He came to to a virgin which was Mary. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why his sin was sinless. Amen. Because we know what the original sin was. Amen. Amen. that were original sin, you know, was a sexual desire through Adam and Eve. Amen. Amen. And that that created a sin nature in all of us. Amen. But Jesus, he had to come and bypass that sin nature. Amen. That's why he was born virgin birth. Amen. God created the egg and the sperm and put it inside of Mary. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And Mary didn't have nothing to do except incubate that word. Amen. That God had put inside of her. Amen. That's why when he was on the cross and they said, "Your mothers look for," he said, "Who is my mother and who is my brother?" Except he who keeps my word. Hallelujah. Amen. God never did acknowledge her as being his mother. Is that right? Amen. Cuz he knew that she was on a bar remove. Amen. Even Mary denied the virgin birth at one time. Hallelujah. Amen. They had gone down to Jerusalem, had left out of Jerusalem for about 3 days journey and they realized that Jesus wasn't with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They realized that they had left the word. Amen. Hallelujah. Sometime we can get going. We have to and we may sometime leave the word. Amen. But one thing about leaving the word, wherever you left it, that's where you'll find it. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They went back into Jerusalem. Amen. And Jes and uh Mary went to look at Jesus said, "Don't you know that me and my father been looking for you?" Amen. Denying the virgin birth. Amen. Hallelujah. But Jesus, you see, one thing about the word, the word will correct that error. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The word will correct the error. Jesus looked at her and said, "Don't you know I must be about my father's business." Amen. And God's Jesus's father's business was not building canvas. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. It was preaching the gospel. Amen. Amen. That's why we got to be about our father's building. Amen. Especially in this hour that we're living in. Amen. When we see that all foundations are out of course. Amen. Is that right? Everything that we put in in trust in is on shaky grounds right now. Amen. Amen. You can't believe the police force. Amen. You can't believe teachers in school. Amen. Amen. You can't even tr put trust in your doctors. Is it right? Amen. And definitely not your politicians. Ain't right. Amen. The only true place you can put trust in is in Jesus Christ and he heal the living word. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the living word. Amen. Put your trust in Christ. Amen. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart. Lean not to thine own understanding, but in all your ways acknowledge him. And his promise is that he will direct your path. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen. See as a John. Amen. He saw that in the right hand of him that sit on the throne. As I said earlier, that that that the cry went out for the kisman redeemer. And God fulfilled that kinsman redeemer requirement in the person of Jesus Christ. He had to become become human and the virgin birth produced that person. Jesus came in the likeness of sinful flesh. As I said, amen. He was in he was just like we are. Jesus got hungry. Jesus got sleepy. Jesus got tired. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But he he didn't his flesh was not sinful. The Bible say he was in all points tempted yet without sin. Because if he had one sin against him, he could not have gone to the cross. Amen. It had to be a sinless sacrifice. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. So he was he was tempted now. Amen. Y'all better believe it. Women approached Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Jesus was offer offer some of alcohol to drink. Amen. They he was probably offered some drinks or something. Is that right? All of that is sin. He was tempted in that but he did not accept it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I say he was in all points tempted but yet without seeing in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. So the cry went out for the kinsman redeemer. Revelation the fifth chapter said who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals the hell? Amen. But there was no man worthy. Amen. Amen. He looked up in heaven. John looked up in heaven. Amen. The 24 elders wasn't worship. That Moses wasn't worthy. Adam wasn't worthy. David wasn't worthy. Amen. He looked even into the earth. Martin Luther King wasn't worthy. Billy Graham wasn't worthy. Ro, even William Brandon wasn't worthy. Amen. Is that right? Amen. He even looked under the earth. The young rich ruler wasn't worthy. Dayan wasn't worthy. Dayan and Kora. Amen. Balam, none of them was worthy. The Bible said John began to weep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he knew if nobody worthy was found that all was lost. Is that right? Amen. But one of the elders said, "Weep not John. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed." Is that right? To open the book and to loose the seals thereof. Amen. But John said he turned and he looked. Amen. But he saw a line a lamb as it has been stain slain. Is that right? And that lamb, he wasn't sitting down. He was standing. Hallelujah. Amen. Cuz he didn't traded a wine press of the wrath of God all by himself. Amen. And he saw a bloody lamb. Amen. That's why the Bible tell us once you've done all that you can do &gt;&gt; stand. Amen. Had your loans gird about with truth. Hallelujah. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. As you've done all you can do. Don't don't give up. Amen. Stand. Amen. God said. Hallelujah. Amen. Bring back the scripture to him. Is that right? God, you said. Hallelujah. I pay my tithes and offering. You'll pour out a blessing enough to me that I cannot behold. Amen. Lord, you said by your stripes I'm already healed. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. God, you say you're my Jehovah Gyra. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. You said bring it back to him. Bring break his word to him. God, you said it. &gt;&gt; And I'm standing on your promises. Amen. I'll do all hell a sail against me. Amen. I'm standing on your word. Amen. I'm like Job. Amen. Hallelujah. Go God gave a good testimony of Job. Amen. He told Satan about Job. Amen. He said, "Though you move against Job, you've taken all that he got. You even got careless children." Amen. But one thing about him, though you move against him, he still holds fast his integrity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Amen. Though the Satan come against us, Amen. Hold on to your integrity. Still be honest, still be pure. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Regardless of what going against you, Amen. Amen. Don't falter. Amen. Hold fast your integrity just like Job. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God can give a testimony to him. Amen. Why they say God allowed Satan to come against Job? Cuz God knew the testimony that Job had in his heart. Amen. He knew the testimony of Job. That why he said, "Have you considered my servant Job? Have you considered my servant Earnest of my servant brother Fred? Have you considered them?" Is that right? Amen. God God knew what was in him. Is that right? Amen. And so when the enemy come in like a flood, stand &gt;&gt; like that lamb was standing. Is that right? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. And see the lamb, he came and he took the book out of out of the hand of him that set on the throne. Amen. It now belongs to the lamb. God's law required a kinsman redeemer. And the lamb cannot book. He said, "I'm the kinsman. I'm the redeemer. I made intercessions for them. Now I have come to claim the rights for them. Amen. They have a right to everything that was lost. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We thank God. Amen. That he said in the Bible. I shall restore unto you all the yield that the canker worm, the pormer, the caterpillar, and the locust have taken away. Is that right? Amen. Well, God said my army that I s against. Amen. But God promised that he going to restore it. And he have in this hour restored it all back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If y'all can believe it. Amen. Amen. God has restored back to us what Adam and Eve had. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I'm crazy enough to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And I and I live live according to that. Is that right? Amen. Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen. And see after the lamb took that book. Amen. Worship broke out into heaven. Is that right? Amen. Worship broke out in heaven cuz God had take the lamb had taken that book and opened the seals and loo and worship. The elders fell down there 24 elders and all of them began to worship and the Bible said they sang a new song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That song be sang that thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kingdom and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth. Amen. Worship broke out. Hallelujah. Amen. Wow. Because God had done something. Amen. Look back through the scriptures. Every time God does some miracle, a news they bring out with a new song. Hallelujah. Amen. I remember when they walked through the God open up the Red Sea. Amen. They walked across on dry land. Amen. Amen. After they after his children got on the other side and Pharaoh tried to follow and God let the sea come back over and kill them. Amen. But the Bible said on that other side of that river, Miriam got that tamarine and they began to praise and worship God. Is that right? Amen. Amen. That's how we should be. Amen. When God bring us deliverance to us, Amen. we shall break out with joy and songs. Amen. And praise to God. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, thanking him for what he have done for us. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can sing a new song. Amen. Amen. I thank God when he brought me out of the world. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. He took out out of the songs worldly songs out of my mouth. Is it right? Amen. Brother, what's going on? And he say loud. I'm breaking. I'm proud. God took them out of my mouth. Amen. And now I can sing a new song. I can sing Amazing Grace. How sweet that sound that saves the rest like me. A new song that I sing now. Not that old song. Amen. Amen. Cuz I once was lost, but now I'm found. Amen. Amen. And hallelujah. And when them seals was open, Amen. God was calling my name. Amen. Cuz see I was I was saved with from the foundation of the world. Amen. Amen. I came into the world and I had spiritual amnesia. I didn't know who I was. Amen. But when them seals open, Amen. Amen. He was calling my name. Amen. Hallelujah. Is that right? Because when them seals open and the revelation of them seals came, Amen. It revealed to me who Jesus Christ was. Amen. Amen. It revealed to me the devil and how he worked. Amen. But it also revealed to me who I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm a child of the king. Amen. Is that right? Amen. I should carry myself as a child of the king. Amen. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Wherever I go. Amen. I carry myself as a son of the king. Amen. Is that right? Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Because you are he God. Amen. You're not the God, but you are a God. Jesus said, "Have not I caught you gods and children of the most high?" Amen. Amen. Is that right? That's the word of God. Amen. Amen. And I reminded him when during this dur during the days of of slavery, there was this man, he had slaves. He that they had to work hard and everything, but it was just one slave. He was distinct from all the other ones. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Regardless of what the man put on him, he did it like did wholeheartedly. Amen. Amen. But he still carried himself. Amen. With dignity. Amen. Hallelujah. So this man came out one day, he wanted to buy some slaves. Amen. So he said, "I I'll take that one over there." The man said, "Not for sale." He said, "Why?" He said, "He's not for sale." Amen. He said, "Do you feed him different?" He said, "No, he eat in the gallow with the other slaves." Amen. Amen. Do you do you let him have any breaks or no? He said, "No, he do all his work just like everybody else." He said, "I wondered about that one day until I found out that in the homeland that his father is a king." So even though he's in a foreign land, is that right? He still carry himself as the son of a king. Is that right? Amen. Even though we are in this land right here. Amen. We know that we are a child of the king. So we should be carried ourselves in royalty. We should act in royalty. Why? Because we are children of the king of God. Amen. I'm a child of the king. Amen. A ten of cardage. I don't care. Amen. We got a mansion over there. Is that right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But on this side, we should carry ourselves as children of the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? Amen. Cuz when we say the name Christian, we we are actually representing the whole Christian nation worldwide. Amen. When you name that name Christian, Amen. And that word Christian means to be Christlike. Amen. Amen. that they were first called Christians at Antioch. Hallelujah. Why? Because they saw that they act and live like Jesus Christ. Amen. And that's what we should be doing in this hour. Amen. I'm not saying you're not doing it. Amen. Amen. But but that's the way we should be. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Because the Bible say we are written epistles &gt;&gt; read of all men. &gt;&gt; People read your life. Read your life. I don't care what somebody profess with their mouth. Amen. All you got to do is read their lives. Amen. The Bible say you know them by the fruit that they bear. Amen. Cuz a apple tree don't bear pears. Amen. And a plum tree don't buy don't bear blackberries. Amen. Is that right? Amen. You know the tree by the fruit you bear. Amen. If you say you a true Christian then the people you be looking for the fruits of the spirit. Amen. In our lives. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Paul when them seven sons ofKea went to that attack that man. Amen. them devils looked at him said, "Paul, I know. Jesus, I know, but who are you?" Amen. Is that right? Amen. But see, right now, we got the devil's answer through the revelation of God's word. Amen. Y'all got to believe that. Amen. Amen. We got to operate in that in that area. Amen. Not saying you're not, but Amen. But I exalt you to do that. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You don't have to sit back and take nothing from the devil. Amen. Amen. We got the reveal word of the hour. Amen. In Jesus Christ. Everything that Adam and Eve lost, God has restored it back to us. Amen. If thou can believe it. Amen. In Jesus Christ. Y'all love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible said in Revelation 8:1, when he had opened that seventh seal, said there was quiet. Is that right? &gt;&gt; There was silence in heaven. When he had taken that that uh uh uh book out of the hand of him that sit on the throne, is that right? Worship broke out. There was worshiping a lot of, you know, praising and worshiping God. Hallelujah. Thanking Jesus. All of those things was going on in heaven. Is that right? But when he opened that seventh seal, everything got quiet. Hallelujah. There was silence in heaven for space of a half an hour. Worshiping stopped. Amen. While God had left the throne, it had come down to the earth. And there was silence because what God was doing was so sacred. No one wanted to. Hallelujah. To interrupt what God was doing. That title D that Adam law that went back in the hand of the original owner was now being brought down to the earth being given to God's earthly messenger. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. To impart to all those who was written in the lamb's book of life of eternal life from the foundation of the world. Is that right? Amen. In Revelation 10:7. Amen. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he began to sound, the mystery of God had just has been finished as he had declared to his servants of prophets. Is that right? Amen. But see that that but all of 10 to one there was a mighty angel come down clothe with a rainbow across his head. Is that right? Amen. And he had in his hand a little book open. Is that right? &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was bringing back the title deed. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. And he handed that title deed to his servant the prophet. Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He handed it to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And John said he looked and he told John said, "Take that little book." Is that right? Is that right, John? Yeah. He went there and said, "Give it to her." He said, "No, you take it. You got to take it." Amen. The Bible said the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violence take it by force. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Sometime we have to get radical with this thing. Amen. Is that right? Amen. You can't Amen. We sometime we have to get forceful with this thing of this word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. In Jesus Christ. Even even like Paul. Amen. Hallelujah. Paul was forceful with that thing. Amen. And we Jesus said Hallelujah. Paul said even if an angel come from heaven and speak anything other than what I speak, let him be accur. Cuz Paul was so sure that that revelation that he had was a direct revelation from Jesus Christ. Amen. Is that right? He He even stood it again. He said, "I say again, if we or an angel come from heaven to speak anything other than what I speak, let him be a cursed." Amen. Is that right? Amen. That's why when a prophet he he was caught beyond the curtain of times. Amen. And he was up there saying all of those old saints up there. Amen. And they told him a lot of those most of those saints were saved during your ministry. Amen. And I got around uh paraphrasing that and he asked him said, "Will Paul be uh judge according to what he's preached?" And he said, they said, "Yeah, he will." He said, "Well, I preach just what Paul preached." Amen. Is that right? Amen. And that the whole all the people that said, "We're resting on the fact that you preach what Paul preached." Amen. Amen. And right now, we got people from Achen laying in the grave. resting in the grave now, trusting in the fact that what we preach to them with what Paul preached. Amen. Is that right? Amen. And we did. Amen. We preach the word. Amen. Just like Paul preaches. Amen. Hallelujah. Sometime you can get tight. But it be right. Is it right? Hallelujah. But we preach what Paul preach. Amen. Amen. But you don't add to it or take away nothing. Amen. Amen. From the word of God. Amen. Is that right? Amen. And Paul preached all of this this word of God cuz he was apostle to the Gentiles in Jesus Christ's name. Y'all love it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now we possess that title deed that Adam lost and all the benefits of of it. The same power, the same authority, the same dominion. God has made us kings and priests. And the Bible said we shall reign on earth. The Bible said Jesus washed us from our sin in his own blood and had made us all kings and priests. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. When you stand in the gap for somebody pray, you're praying and you stand in the gap for somebody. You're actually operating in your priestly ministry. Standing in the gap with that person. Amen. Amen. You say, "Well, I'm a king when I'm a rule." Rule over sin in your life. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Have dominion over sin in your life. Amen. Bring your body into subjection to the word of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Rule over your body. Amen. It says in Jesus Christ's name, we're king and priest. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for that. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And operating your priestly ministry also. Amen. Stand in the gap for your loved ones. Amen. Is that right? Amen. For your children, for your wife, your husband. Amen. Amen. Pray and claim them for the kingdom of God. Amen. Amen. I'm reminded when Job Amen. Hallelujah. Every morning he offer offered a sacrifice for his children just in the event that he may have sinned against God. Amen. any God servant in this house that when that house fell on them and killed them all. Hallelujah. Not one of them was lost because that prayer of Job was there as a memorial for them. Amen. Is that right? Y'all believe that? Amen. Amen. So when God was restoring Job, Amen. Cuz they had taken all these cattle, all the horse, all these animals and everything. God restored them back double. He had a thousand horses, he gave him 2,000. Amen. Had a 100 sheep, he gave him 200 sheep. Is that right? But when it came down to the children, he only gave them seven. Amen. Why he didn't double the children? Because he already had seven on the other side already saved. So when the seven on the earth to get over there with the seven in heaven. Amen. That was double. Hallelujah. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. We possess the title of deed that have lost and all the benefits of it. Why? Because the Bible said the meek shall inherit the earth. Amen. Luke 17:30, God promised that the Son of Man would be revealed when the days get like they were in Sodom. And I must say that we're living in the days of Sodom right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perversion is everywhere. &gt;&gt; All over the world, &gt;&gt; men marrying men, women marrying women. We're in that sodomite condition yet once again. Amen. But to to us, Amen. It's not a bad time for us because we realize that in even in the midst of all of this mess, the son of man is revealing himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Y'all believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We know that that that uh in the God comes in three sons names. Amen. God came in the son of man with a prophet. Is that right? He come in the son uh son of God. Amen. Which is the Holy Ghost. Amen. He didn't come as the son of David in the millennium. Amen. Amen. But we know that in the midst of uh in between the the ministry of the son of God and the son of David that God was going to be revealed once again as a son of man. Is that right prophet to reveal what? The son of man. Amen. And he has done that. Is that right? Amen. He has come. Amen. I remind him when he was baptizing I think on it may have been on Ohio River. What? What river he was baptizing on. Amen. And that light came and it shone over him and out of that light the voice spoke. He said as John the Baptist for my first coming. Is that right? He said your message shall forrun my second coming. Amen. So this very message that we got is that right? We we're privileged to have Amen. is actually a message that's forrunning the coming of Christ. That's how important it is. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can believe that. Amen. Amen. It's for running Christ. Christ is on is this coming this message has been given to us. Amen. What? To turn our hearts back to the faith that the Pentecostal fathers had. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Because right now we're enjoying this message right now. But one day, Amen. As God cut the Jews off, he going to cut us off. Is that right? Amen. Because the same message that we're enjoying got to go back to the Jews. Go to the Jews. God promised the Jews, Amen, one week of preaching. Amen. We know that one week in the Bible represent seven years. Jesus preached only three and a half years and he was cut off at the cross. Amen. Is that right? And after that Jews would were not accepted. God ushered us Gentiles in. Amen. We know that God blinded the Jews that they might not receive him. Is that right? Why? Because that gave us an opportunity for us Gentile dogs to come into the &gt;&gt; Is that right? The kingdom. Amen. But as as God cut the Jews off and ushered us in, God is going to cut us off. Is that right? The days of the Gentiles dispensation is closing. Amen. Amen. And once that this days of the Gentile dispensation closes, then this this uh uh revelation of Jesus Christ that we're enjoying, I hope you're enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Is going to come go over to the Jews to pull out the elected 144,000. Amen. Amen. Because they don't know Jesus Christ as the Messiah not yet. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So God owed he preached to them for three and a half years. He owed them another three and a half years of preaching. Amen. Amen. Like I said earlier that all the promises of God are what? Yay and amen. Amen. Hallelujah. But I said in between the ministry, the son of God ministry and the and the son of David ministry, God will be revealed again as a son of man. Is that right? And God will be in human flesh again. Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, God's messenger is off the scene now. But did did the the ministry stopped? No. The ministry is now in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is that right? Everything that that he did. Amen. We may have not reached that total point yet, but what he did, God is now using us to do the same same thing. Amen. Is that right? Amen. And he and he had reached the pinnacle of his ministry. Amen. Amen. And he said he had to pull back. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And Jesus said, you know that brother, he was out a way chief over. Is that right? Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen. But we now when he left off the scene, he said now the move is on the bride. Is that right? The very thing that he did, Amen. we should be doing and will be doing. Amen. If you can believe that. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. God has brought us back to the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; God has now brought us back to the spoken word. Whatever he said in the word Bible said, "Whatever you say, that's the way it'll be done." Whatever you say. Amen. He said, "If you pray and doubt not, you'll have what you ask for." Y'all believe that? Amen. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. You pray and doubt not, you'll have what you ask for. I reminded when Paul and Paul Paul and Silas I believe was in the jail in the book of Acts. Amen. And they were locked up in the chains. Amen. But they were still worshiping God. Hallelujah. They worshiping God so so much. Amen. That all of a sudden the chains fell off of them. The jail those are the jail flew over. Amen. The jailer he ran back there scared. Amen. That they had escaped and he know that they had escaped that they were going to kill him. Amen. So he he was about to take his life. Paul said, "Oh, do yourself no harm. We all still yet here." Amen. Hallelujah. But they had worshiped God so much that that that jeal had fallen under conviction. Amen. Till he come running to him and said, "Men and brother, what must I do to be saved?" Hallelujah. Amen. Paul didn't tell him what not to do. But he said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. You and your household shall be saved." Amen. Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Not that his not that his faith not that his salvation was going to save his house, but his faith for his family was going to save his house cuz he believed God what the word say if you believe and doubt not you should have what you ask for. Hallelujah. That's why claim your children. Amen. They may be cutting up. Claim them anyway. Claim your brothers and your sister, your loved ones. Amen. They may not be coming this way, but claim them for the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Amen. If you and you hold that prayer, God is obligated to answer that prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you praying dot dot, God ain't going to break his word. Amen. God ain't going to change his word. He didn't even change his word for himself. Amen. Amen. He looked at he said, "Lord, if it be possible, let this cup pass for me." Amen. But nevertheless, not my will, but let thy will be done. Amen. He ain't going to change your word, not for himself and not for us. Amen. Amen. And none of his word shall ever fail. Amen. Amen. Heaven and earth will pass away, but not one jot, not till, not even the punctuation in the in the scriptures, the periods and the comma, none of that will pass away to all be fulfilled. Hallelujah. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. So, we got a sure word of prophecy and we got to believe that. Amen. We got to honor that. Amen. And and and hold fast to it in the name of Jesus Christ because it's your message. Amen. Is that right? Amen. is is introducing is ushering in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. This wrote, this message is going to get get us filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This message of our Amen. is going to get us filled with faith. Is it right? Amen. Cuz this is a faith message. Amen. It's a Holy Ghost message. Amen. Amen. Cuz see, faith is a revelation. Amen. And the the the key to the rapture is faith. Is that right? The Bible say Enoch was translated. Is that right? Amen. Amen. H Enoch walked with God, but he was not. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God took him. But before his translation, he had this one testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He pleased God. Jesus said, "Lord, I know you hear me because I always do the things that pleases you." Amen. Is that right? Amen. And we want to always do things that pleases God. Amen. So we can have that same testimony. Lord, I know you're here because I do everything to please you. Amen. Amen. And all you got to do is keep God's word. Amen. Amen. You keep God's word, you'll please him. Amen. Is that right? Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I say, the same ministry, the same thing, the spirit of the own brother, it didn't leave when he left. is now moved into the bride. We've now become the living word of God. Is that right? Amen. And see, because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Amen. I reminded when Elijah crossed that Jordan River. Amen. He had told Elijah if he see him when he leave, he'll get what he asked for. So Elijah asked for a double portion of what he had. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. So when Elijah walked down to that river, Amen. he took that mana and he smoked that water. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And that water party. Amen. And they walked across. Amen. Hallelujah. The Bible don't say that. But when they walked the cross, that water closed back up. The Bible don't say that, but it did. Why? Cuz when after after Elijah took off and that man fell down with the type of the Holy Ghost, is that right? Elijah picked up that manner and he spoke that water again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Amen. And once again, the water parted. Amen. Why? He had that same spirit that was on Elijah was in a double portion upon the Elishia. And the Elisha is a type of the bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Y'all believe he got a double portion on you now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All we got to do is operate on it. Amen. Do what Jesus did. Amen. Is that right? Do as Jesus did. Amen. Hallelujah. Cuz Jesus said, "The works I do shall ye do even greater work than these cuz I go to the father." Is that right? Not that we can do anything greater than what Jesus did. Amen. But the greater work is that we once we can impart eternal life to somebody. Is that right? But it'll be more of us doing what Jesus did. Amen. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of man is re being revealed in this hour of sodomite condition through his bride. Is that right? In the form of the Holy Ghost. Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Y'all believe that? Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. As I as I draw down to close, I'm reminded about two years ago, we lo lost our son down in Florida. Amen. A guy killed him. Yeah, man. Stabbed him. Is that right? He stabbed him one time in the chest. That wasn't too bad. Is that right? Anytime you get stabbed is bad. Period. You know, excuse me. But when they stabbed him on this side, it cut a main artery that went to his brain and he was uh actually dead. Is that right? When they went in, they patched up that vein and they gave him eight pints of blood and and as he was coming out of the surgery, he had a major stroke and they had to rush him take him back to surgery. They put a a hose in his head to drain the fluid off of his brain. But actually a son, he was actually even though it had him on life support, he was dead for actually for 8 days. For 8 days he laid in that bed, no response, no kind of activity. Only thing that kept him going was that life support that was breathing breath into his body. Amen. So they called and told the wife, Amen, that they were going to have to take him off the life support. And she said, "If you can just leave him on there to Sunday, we'll be back down to Florida." And we had to be back down there at 10:00 that Sunday morning. And and we was there. And so we went in the room to see him. They asked us to leave out the room cuz they were going to take the life support off off of it. And because they said once they pull that tube out of it, a lot of time they throws up and they didn't want us to see that. But God was in control. Amen. They they like I said, he laid there. He was actually dead for 8 days. And he was only being kept going by that respirator. And once they took it out of him, is that right? Well, he didn't throw up. Amen. So they brought us back into the room. Amen. And he he had he was gone. He was dead. Hallelujah. God is good. But my prayer as we were standing here, I said, "Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, let him open his eyes." Hallelujah. Lord, I want to see his eyes open. Now, a man that's been dead for eight days, no activity in his body. Is that right? Amen. Amen. Just like God did to Lazarus. Amen. Lazarus dead in the grave. Amen. His spirit was gone. His soul was gone. God called that spirit back into Lazarus's body. Called his soul back into that Lazarus body. Lazarus got up out of the grave. God did the same thing for my son. even though he had been dead for eight days. Is that right? Through prayer to the Lord. Amen. A man that's been dead for eight days opened his eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this day, he opened his eyes. He looked around. Then he closed his eyes. Then he opened his eyes again. And this time a little tear was coming down his eyes. Hallelujah. Amen. But then he closed his eyes and he was gone. Amen. Amen. Well, I just want to share to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. All we got to do is take him at his word. All we got to do is be willing enough to step out on his promises. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And that that's a testimony that I share. Amen. Until I leave here, God opened the eyes of a dead man for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The works that Jesus did, I was able to do through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Because the word has been restored back in my life. And now I claim it. I am a walking living word in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And you are too. Amen. Amen. You just got to be willing to claim it. Amen. and operate in it and do the very works that Jesus did and you will receive the same results. Is that right? Get a lot of cap praise. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Though my son has gone on to the other world now. Amen. Amen. Even though he didn't like live a life worthy of the gospel, my prayer will save him cuz I prayed for him constantly like Job did his children. So I'm not I'm sad because I don't have the fellowship with him on this side, but I believe on the other side he's all right. He's all right. Amen. Cuz God is faithful to his promises. God is faithful to his word. Because the son of man is revealing himself through his bride in this sodomite condition hour that we're living in. Amen. Believest thou do &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us bow Jesus name. Lord in your allsufficient name. Hallelujah. First of all we thank you for being our God. We thank you for predestination. We thank you for bestowing upon us eternal life even before the foundation of the world. We thank you for sending the word back in this hour, Lord, to to open our eyes and take away our spiritual amnesia that we can see who that we are, that we are the child of the queen, that we are the bride of Jesus Christ, knowing that even as you put Adam to sleep, Lord, and took a bride out of his side when you died on the cross and they spirit you in the side, out came your bride in this hour. I came water and blood and now that water, blood, and spirit is searching the earth. Amen. Seeking for those, Amen. who was ordained to eternal life.
