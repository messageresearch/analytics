[30:44] it says and he said unto them
[30:52] and said unto them it is not for you to
[30:55] know
[30:56] the time of the season which the father
[30:59] has put
[31:00] in his own power but you shall receive
[31:04] power after that the holy ghost has come
[31:07] upon you
[31:08] and you shall be witnesses unto me
[31:12] both in jerusalem and in all judea
[31:15] and in samaritan and in the utmost parts
[31:18] of the earth
[31:20] may god bless you towards you may be
[31:21] seated
[31:25] luke 24
[31:29] luke 24
[31:37] and 44
[31:39] [Music]
[31:42] and he said unto them these are the
[31:45] words which i
[31:46] spake unto you while i was yet with you
[31:49] that all things must be fulfilled which
[31:52] were written in the law of moses and in
[31:55] the prophets and in the song
[31:57] concerning me then opened he their
[32:00] understanding that they might understand
[32:02] the scripture
[32:04] and said unto them thus it is written
[32:07] and thus it behooves
[32:08] christ to suffer and arise from the dead
[32:12] the third day and that repentance
[32:15] and remission of sin should be preached
[32:18] in his name
[32:19] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[32:23] and you're witnesses of these things and
[32:26] behold
[32:26] i send the promise of my father upon you
[32:30] but terry in the city of jerusalem
[32:34] until ye be endured with power
[32:39] from on high
[32:43] they were under expectation
[32:49] expecting the power
[32:53] expecting the power
[32:57] they were expecting the power
[33:02] i believe the element
[33:05] of the church today
[33:09] is that their loss they have
[33:13] lost their expectation they don't really
[33:16] expect the prophet of god said we get
[33:18] what we
[33:19] what expect
[33:22] expecting the power god said
[33:26] i want you retiring in jerusalem and i
[33:29] want you to wait there until you be
[33:30] endured with power
[33:36] now
[33:39] without the power
[33:43] of god in our lives
[33:48] without his power
[33:51] we're not going to be able to do
[33:56] the greater works we need the power
[34:01] for he said the works that i do shall
[34:04] you do
[34:04] also and greater works than these shall
[34:08] you do
[34:09] because i go to my father
[34:13] so jesus said i go away
[34:18] but i shall return i'm coming back
[34:22] and you're gonna he said i'm with you
[34:25] but i shall be in you
[34:29] god that was with him promised to be in
[34:32] them
[34:35] and the works that he did
[34:38] are expectation or we ought to be
[34:41] expecting
[34:42] to do the same works
[34:48] but i feel like it's just a byword
[34:52] preachers are preaching it folks are
[34:55] repeating it
[34:59] but there must be a manifestation and a
[35:04] fulfillment of it
[35:08] not in the just the preacher but each
[35:11] and every individual
[35:16] for he said without me you can do
[35:18] nothing
[35:22] just talking to
[35:26] one of the store managers
[35:29] at a store yesterday in
[35:32] and he said he was spiritual
[35:36] and i said that's fine
[35:40] and he was talking about energy
[35:47] and he was talking about
[35:51] the creator
[35:57] and that
[36:01] he came from the word
[36:04] in the breath of god
[36:10] i said you call just creator
[36:15] an energy i call it and then he went on
[36:18] to say
[36:20] the holy ghost that's the whole lord
[36:23] he's talking about the holy ghost
[36:26] he got you i'm talking about folk and
[36:29] mis
[36:30] mix it all up messed it all up
[36:34] the folk don't know what the holy ghost
[36:38] is
[36:40] am and and when he got through talking i
[36:42] said
[36:43] he seemed to be a little deeper than
[36:46] most preachers i know
[36:48] even in the message of the hour
[36:53] i said but i i i want to rename
[36:56] what you call the creator and i'm
[36:58] talking about jesus
[37:02] and i'm talking about you don't want to
[37:05] recognize
[37:06] you know uh god but
[37:10] i want to tell you about god
[37:14] who is the word
[37:20] see brother and sister people are under
[37:23] expectation and they don't know what
[37:25] they're looking for
[37:31] just to die and become energy
[37:37] but you and i are on expectation not
[37:40] to die but to be changed
[37:46] glory to god it's got to be something to
[37:49] quicken your mortal body
[37:53] it's got to be quick and power inside of
[37:56] you
[37:57] amen the prophet of god talked about it
[38:00] in the horizon of the sun he was talking
[38:01] about the quickening power
[38:04] brother and sister we need quick and
[38:06] power in the church
[38:09] hallelujah i look for a church that full
[38:11] so full of the quicken power
[38:13] amen that when you walk through the
[38:15] doors the people are coming in there
[38:17] what other power of god is quicker than
[38:20] them
[38:22] amen somebody that's in gut
[38:26] with god in a real way
[38:29] in the power of god is activated in
[38:32] their life
[38:35] that quick in power real brother sister
[38:38] you got to
[38:39] amen it's not only good to feel it but
[38:42] to know that
[38:43] it's not just power but the person
[38:46] praise god oh yes the very person the
[38:51] very light
[38:52] oh god of god inside of you
[38:57] see we just don't want just the power we
[39:00] want
[39:01] amen the person we want jesus christ
[39:05] because if we got him
[39:07] we have the power
[39:11] see people just want to amen to
[39:14] do great works but they don't want jesus
[39:17] to have the preeminence in their life
[39:21] are you with me we ought to want jesus
[39:24] to live in me lord
[39:29] i want you to be my life amen that i
[39:32] live i want you to be my life god
[39:36] the life that i'll not live i don't want
[39:39] it to be me no more
[39:40] i want it to be jesus
[39:43] oh yes i want jesus to live oh
[39:46] god hallelujah
[39:50] it's something about expecting something
[39:53] from god
[39:55] amen expecting god to do what he said
[40:00] amen what he promised our lord you
[40:02] promised
[40:03] you shall receive power after the holy
[40:06] ghost has come
[40:07] upon you amen i said if
[40:11] it has come upon you
[40:14] then i'm expecting to see the power
[40:18] come on somebody too many times folk
[40:21] claim to have
[40:22] something that they know nothing about
[40:26] come on somebody they're waiting on god
[40:29] to do what he said
[40:33] amen believers shall do in my name you
[40:37] shall
[40:38] cast out devils isn't that right
[40:41] because the power that's in you
[40:44] amen produces the miracles
[40:48] the signs and the oneness amen of
[40:50] produce because
[40:52] god is in you
[40:56] hallelujah oh we're not
[40:59] we're not just here just having uh a
[41:02] meeting
[41:02] or a church we here amen because
[41:06] the power of god is here when two or
[41:09] three are gathered in my name there i
[41:11] am in the midst i'm talking about
[41:14] genuine
[41:15] power that you as an individual possess
[41:19] inside of you not you confess but
[41:22] possess
[41:24] amen because many people are confessing
[41:27] but they're not possessing
[41:29] amen they don't have the goods
[41:32] are you with me but if you as an
[41:35] individual
[41:36] ain't it has been endured with power
[41:39] from on high
[41:41] if you have the baptism of the holy
[41:44] ghost
[41:45] amen then if you got the holy ghost
[41:48] power
[41:52] praise god paul said i didn't come to
[41:54] you with excellency of speech
[41:56] with the wisdom of amen but i came to
[41:59] you in demonstration of the spirit and
[42:01] in power
[42:02] amen is something about the power of god
[42:06] praise god it changes change they meant
[42:09] amen it transformed things they meant
[42:12] praise god you ought to be expecting
[42:14] amen a transformation
[42:17] amen praise god that's what happens when
[42:20] amen the power of god comes into your
[42:22] life
[42:23] amen when jesus come in it transforms
[42:26] you
[42:26] it changes you amen praise god it
