something lord comfort them this morning father father god speak to the needs this morning let your mercy reign let your grace be pulled out let your name be uplifted bless the word now as we trust you in jesus name amen saint john 11 25 i just read the 24th verse saint john 11 24 marta said unto him i know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though you were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this god bless you reading his word you may be seated the bible tells us the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death so death seems to be our enemy the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death but we want to talk about resurrection jesus talked about he that believeth in me though you were dead you actually live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die i want to talk about the resurrection this morning because that is our hope but to be resurrected in the event of a resurrection you must have the resurrector inside so we're looking forward to the event they call the rapture amen the resurrection we're looking forward to the event but without the resurrector then we don't have resurrection but jesus declared that i am not just an event i am the person so the resurrection is not just an event it is also a person and that person jesus identifies himself as being the resurrection for i am the resurrection so in order to be in the resurrection in order to be in the rapture then the rapture amen must be in you are you with me now the bible tells us in ecclesiastes that which has been is now and that which is a b is already man and god requires that which is past and that there is nothing new under the sun are you with me so we have the event of a rapture as one that was translated named enoch we had another event that elijah was taking up in the fiery chariot and then we had jesus the resurrector amen he said no man take my life i laid down and i got the power to take it up again amen and he told them in saint luke 24 after he had rose from the dead he said thus it had written and does it be who christ the suffering the rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin shall be preached in his name beginning at jerusalem are you with me so we understand that he said but i want you to tarry ye in the city of jerusalem and wait there until you be endured with power from on high the church without the power is with a church without the resurrection and in the future without the power amen does not have the resurrection many folks are are inclined to believe that somehow they'll be in the rapture in the resurrection because they meant they're simply they made believers in christ now many people thought because they were god chosen people and they came out of egypt that they had access to the promised land it was a promise to abraham eisen and jacob but there many people that came out of egypt that never made it to the promised land and there are many people that accept that jesus christ will never be in the rapture or you appear because the bible said because of unbelief they did not enter in we got the continuity amen to believe and follow god's instructions all the way until the chains come amen we cannot stop until we reach our final destination and if we got heaven on our mind then we got to keep pressing as they told the prophet beyond the curse of time keep pressing on amen keep pressing on we got to keep pressing we cannot stop in this journey as though we have apprehended that though we are already attained we must keep practicing amen there must be oppressing us lord i got to attain until the resurrection of the dead amen i can't stop pressing well yes sometimes folks get comfortable and settle down and stop praying and stop fasting and stop amen crying out for a close a walk with god they get contented in the wilderness and amen they don't feel a need that i have not even reached my final destination amen there must be a people on the earth in the last days that would challenge death and that would defeat death and they would end death dominion in the physical realm and they would defy death amen paul amen speaks of oh death where's the stain oh grave where's that victory amen i want you to know amen that there must be a people that looks at death and tell death praise god i'm going to destroy you praise god hallelujah that death is defeated and those that are victors and those that are overcomers and those that know who they are amen will walk out in the face of adversities in the troubles of this world amen i thought i was going to speak on this morning the secret place amen hide me in the secret place somebody said hire me until your rap passover he said in psalms 27 he said hallelujah the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i feel the lord is discriminating my life for whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and failed i like it said the walls shall rise against us i will not fear amen i like when he said in the time of trouble he should hide me in his provision and the secrets of his tabernacle shall he hide me i thank god that god got a secret place to hide us amen i thank god today is a sacred place brother and sister to hide us in the time of trouble i believe we're in trouble times and i believe that god has a sacred place to hide you and i in a time of trouble praise god the world does not know about this secret place amen because the world amen cannot enter into the secret place just like the high priest went into the holy of holiness only once a year and i'll tell you there's a place where the rapture takes place amen there's a place where the resurrection takes place amen and joseph knew it remember by revelation that the amen the place of the resurrection was not going to be in egypt so he said when you leave egypt take my bones with you amen take my bones with me because there is a place where the resurrection will take place and my bones are in egypt amen it's a oh hallelujah there's a place that god has ordained that the resurrection will take place [Music] praise god bearing with me with my fathers amen i want to go i don't want you to bury me here some folks may not think amen that they can be buried in any way and anyhow amen and still amen be a part of the resurrection but brother and sister let me serve notice on you you can't be buried in any place amen and expect amen to be resurrected amen if that was the case amen joseph would have stayed his bones in egypt but he didn't want to stay in egypt take my bones out of here let's go to romans 6 brother and sister if i were a teacher i would have you here for hours just teaching and giving you scripture but i'm just preaching to you and hoping that you're following me are you with me this morning god is good you love him this morning amen all i want is folks to love god if you love god you love me amen if you love god you'll love one another amen if you're not in love with god you're going to have all kind of craziness going on in your mind and in your heart amen but when you got the love of god in your heart you don't worry about a thing praise god and you don't worry about what folks think about you what folks about you amen you don't worry about what happened yesterday what's gonna happen tomorrow you just love god amen i'm on my way to heaven and i'm enjoying my trip you want to go here you are uh praise god i didn't got caught up here so where we are six romans six uh what shall we say then amen praise god i thank god he says what shall we say then shall we continue and sin the grace may abound god forbid how shall we there amen are dead to sin living and long are they in are you with me i i want to know amen paul is re-emphasizing uh or emphasizing what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound amen i want to know god forbid amen he said no ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his what amen see what happens if you don't have that personal personal amen you know i in connection this morning i thought i i i would just let you know that the resurrection has a voice and something about the voice of his thunder amen the secret of thunder the resurrection has a voice and divorce is associated uh with thunder the voice of resurrection is associated with the thunder the bible says when he uh called ladders up from the grave he said he cried with a loud voice as though it thundered are you what man the bible says in revelation 10 seven thunders uttered their voices and i was about to write and he said seal up the sand with the seven thunders other than write them not but in the days of the voice the bible says in the lord himself your descent from heaven with the shard and with the voice of an archangel amen so the voice of god must speak to you in order for you to be a part of the resurrection you must hear the voice certainly joel said he'll call and i'll answer you must hear god's voice as an individual personally because it is the voice of the resurrection that called ladders from the dead that same voice must cause you from the dead amen that's why he said in ephesians 2 you who were dead in crutch christ and sin has a quickened amen made alive amen zika saw the valley of the dry bones and he said amen the spirit of the lord took me out into a valley and it was full of bones and he said son of man can these bones live and he said lord god i know it he said prophesy to the bones and say ye all your dry bones hear the word of the lord i wonder if anybody hearing amen can anybody hear the word of the lord praise god one day amen my bones were dry and i was hopeless but i heard the voice the voice of the resurrection that spoke to me you and i must hear the voice of the resurrection we must hear god personally speak to you praise god you must be certain that it is god that's speaking amen it's not the preaching in the pulpit but it's the voice of god amen it's not amen william brown i'm just speaking but it's the voice of god it's not uh brother simmers they're speaking but it's the voice of god amen they can't be the preacher in the book it's got to be god personally heaven let you know that i am the resurrect praise god he that liveth and believeth in me though he would die you actually live and whosoever liveth and believe it to me shall never die where how many you want to live forever you'll never die amen you'll never die praise god amen oh lord i can't die now somebody said i i done died one time and i don't have to die no more praise god i died and died one time oh thank god that oh god you be dead with christ amen praise god i thank god that a death got to take place in order for a resurrection to take place okay praise god if you expect resurrection then you've got to die first because in order to have resurrection then something got to be dead praise god and you must die to yourself amen if if death would take you to a better condition and give you a better body would you trade this life for a better one for eternal life will you lose this one amen that you might find a better amen the bible said that this earthly house of this tabernacle word is all oh we have a building a house not made at hand eternal in the heavens do you want a better house praise god are you satisfied with this pet's house amen this thing here is skin worms this is that's what god got a body hallelujah not a temporal but an eternal hallelujah for the things that are seen a temporal but the things that are not seen those things are eternal faith is the substance of things hopeful in the evidence of things not seen you are the seed of abraham by faith so you are resurrected the invisible has been made visible to you by the power of the holy ghost you say those things that ought to be hallelujah what do you see amen those things that are revealed to you by the spirit amen if our eyes have not seen here have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god has prepared for them that love him amen but their things are being revealed to you by the spirit amen what eyes cannot see earth cannot hear but by the holy ghost god will make known to you the mysteries of his will amen i'm so glad that there is something they meant that god does with our hearts praise god our hearts need to be washed amen we need to be clean it needs to be purified and god would take it amen david said wash me with his ship that i might be made clean god can take a amen a heart amen that is filthy and dirty and god can wash you god bless you romans here for it says therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto what for unto death for romans 6 and 4 we're buried with him by baptism unto death see when you're baptized in water in the name of jesus christ that's why you don't be sprinkled when you're baptized in water in the name of jesus christ you're baptized unto death and not only it describes deficits here he says we shall also be in the likeness of his what resurrection excuse me no i skipped over okay we're baptized into his death that like as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also shall walk in what come on somebody if you're not living the life then it's something about the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the lord in jesus christ's name something about what you're missing out on if you still got your same filthy and dirty desires if your heart is still dirty and filthy and you still desire the things of this world then you have not died yet to die is to accept what jesus paid the price for amen he died that you might not have that you can live okay i gotta close here in a minute let me read the next verse but because you might miss that that verse but don't miss this one okay for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his what okay some people just play in church they come to church but they died yet and they don't want to die you know the prophet god said about the lunatic man that was beating up all the preachers and and he fell at his feet he was breaking preachers noses and beating them up and the prophet rose about 120 pounds and the man was six feet something all the preachers about 100 preachers on the pulpit they weren't running the man come up and say i'll show you he said you'll fall over my feet that man come up down and he thought he was going to hit him and when he got the rail back to hit him he fell down under the anointing and they had some officers in the audience because there was thousands of people there and they came up to say is he dead and he said no they say is he healed he said no he said what's the bible he said he loved that spirit see you got to get out of love with the world and the things of the world long as you love the world the love of the father is what not in you it's a lot of people love what they're doing you can't stop them from doing what they're doing until god bring conviction in their heart a lot of folk love what they're doing they love sinning and they love being a sinner but when you love god amen [Music] you got to fall in love with god are you with me and when you fall in love with god god takes your sins away your desires change your nature change you want to live for god now are you with me so most people you know until god changed that nature changes your heart changes your desire but before he can do that you got to hear god my sheep know my voice amen and that voice is the voice of the resurrection that voice that said prophesied to the bones can these moans live and ezekiel began to prophesy to the bones god does that for our lives when we're dead in our sins jesus said come to me all you the labor and heaven late and i'll give you rest it doesn't matter how many times we go to the motion when we go to the motion and nothing happens in our lives there's no change made there's no uh new creature come forth there's no new life come forth all we did was join the church all we've done was fake it that if you fake it you can't make it are you up man well don't lie to yourself don't deceive your own self amen amen you got to be honest amen when god speak you know i'm going to tell you something when god speaks to you amen changes are made amen you can't say well i thought god i thought i was saved i thought i you know ain't no thought in thinking that praise god there's nothing like god when god speaks to you amen it's certain it's certain you know it's god you amen because you know that nobody knows you like god praise god amen and god can identify the secrets and thoughts and intents of the heart god knows everything about you are you with me the preacher can be preaching but god can be talking are you with and when god talks amen you know it ain't the preacher talking is god talking to you amen and god emphasizing to you this is not the preacher this is me are you with me and when god speak to you you have no other choice but obey god or suffer the consequences are you with me praise god the consequences of if i turn down god where i'm going if i tell god i don't want to come to him where i'm going amen peter said thou only have the words of eternal life where i'm going lord where we gonna go praise god amen but i tell you jesus said come to me amen i'll give you rest amen it's whether or not your your soul needs rest whether or not you want your soul to have rest or not it wants it amen i got the clothes he said in the fifth verse if ye then be what the romans six and five if you then be what planted together in the likeness of his what y'all hear that now you worry about whether or not i can be sprinkled whether or not i just accept jesus christ in my heart i want you to be buried i want you to be planted oh you look man and the likeness of his what there we shall also be we shall be also in the likeness of his work resurrection you know you got so many people said brother simon won't you just tell the people that you just lying to yourself playing church and playing like you're going to heaven and playing like you love god and all that hypocrisy you're you're fooling you're lying to your own self you're cheating yourself because in the final analysis you can't fool god are you with me you might as well get real nine be real because brother and sister don't amen well i blame the preacher don't blame the preacher amen when god speaks to you he speaks to you as an individual are you with me if i if i die my soul be lost and nobody fall are you with me so you must make your own decision whether or not you're going to serve god or whatnot you want to be in the world amen if you love him you're serving if you don't love him you better well make up your mind i don't love god i don't love god i love the world i think the devil will treat me better than god i know some folks think that they and they say when they're mild i love god with their deeds the way they they actually speak what a lot of them in their words are you with me when you go and you do what you big enough and bad enough to do amen when god worked amen you trot and you over the word of god and go and do what you want to do anyhow oh are you with me god bless you this morning i want to i can't i really can't get into this too deep but god is good amen the resurrection is i believe we're closer than we ever been to the rapture and the coming of the lord i believe he with jezebel in the white house i believe that baal worship is coming and the mark of the beast is coming i believe that doors like this will be shut down and closed up in the future except you received the mark are you with me say what the rest of the folks are saying everything is all right and we all love are you with me folks don't want to know that they're going to hell if you don't live right are you with me don't say that that sounds like a bad word but you better hear it now because you don't want to hear him say depart from me your work was over then i don't know you how would you like for god to say it you better listen to the preacher tell you amen because one day the voice that was echoing inside of you telling you to give your life to jesus that voice that was working and you said you need to put away this and put away that and you kept on ignoring the voice are you with me praise god it's just like the man that was out prospecting and he found gold and he was on his way back amen with all his gold and he had a dog that was with him and the [Music] was dog and barking and he was trying to sleep he's on his way back to make his claim and he was going to be rich and thinking on his riches and he was tired of the dog barking and he he said well he told the dog to shut up the dog barking trying to warn him so i'm tired of the dog shut up and sort of what happened the prospect of his good friend the dog has been his buddy all the time he took and he shot the killer dog shot the dog the dog was trying to tell him there was somebody following him and trying to warn him but instead of him listening to the dog and that's what the voice of god he's trying to warn you don't kill the voice that's trying to warn you speaking to you every time you go do this and do that and go this way that way that voice don't you kill the boy and stop the voice are you with me when you're going in the wrong direction that voice that tells you to come on back to god don't do that baby don't do that sister brother don't do that oh no you said that boys that sound like my daddy that might be your daddy but it ain't your daddy it's god it's god's speaking to daddy god's speaking to mama is god saying to you don't do that and you wish you could dead in the voice of mama and daddy amen well mom and dad are gone but their voices still live they meant the things that they they they told you amen and i'm gonna tell you something as i said on another sunday divorce of many water divorce of judgment divorce of multitudes amen be the verses of judgment that will come up and those preachers and the messengers to our daisies that have told you the truth those voices will meet you in judgment you couldn't add those dead in those voices anymore brother and sister you got to get right with god now remember he says i am the resurrection the one that you'd ever dead and sin you heard his voice that same voice if you continue to follow that voice not only would it save you from your sins for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life that same voice that called you simply i died for your sins you don't have to be sinner and be condemned in the end but you could be saved god bless you this morning the voice of the resurrection the voice of jesus calling the voice of the archangel which causes the dead in christ to rise that same voice causes the dead that was in the world amen that calls you out of the world calls you out of your sin that same voice of you the voice of the resurrection same jesus just are you with me not another voice the same
