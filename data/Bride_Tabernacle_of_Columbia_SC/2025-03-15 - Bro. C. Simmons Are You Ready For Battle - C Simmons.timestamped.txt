[18:49] to give us a song. Amen.
[18:54] [Music]
[19:17] is a challenge to
[19:20] accept. It takes grace to rise and
[19:23] prove.
[19:25] is the way that we can show the world
[19:29] that Jesus Christ is
[19:32] true. Is a life to live a
[19:36] testimony
[19:39] blameless. Living for
[19:43] Christ, standing every
[19:47] day. So we got to
[19:51] prove that we're one in a million.
[19:56] And we got to
[19:58] show the power of the
[20:03] blood. And we got to prove that we're
[20:07] not like those from
[20:10] Sina. We got to show that we're a people
[20:15] that this world isn't worthy of.
[20:22] Now, the testimony of
[20:25] Christ is a feeling that you've been
[20:29] saved. It's a joy of your life with him.
[20:34] It's the glowing on your face to really
[20:39] know that you have
[20:44] overcome. and you'll keep the
[20:48] promise of sitting on the
[20:53] throne. So we got to
[20:57] prove that we're one in a
[21:01] million and we got to
[21:04] show the power of the
[21:09] blood. And we got to prove that we're
[21:13] not like those from
[21:16] Satan. We got to show that we're a
[21:20] people that this world isn't worthy
[21:26] of. Now, the testimony of
[21:30] Christ is the feeling that you've been
[21:34] saved. It's the joy of your life with
[21:38] him.
[21:40] It's a glowing on your face. You'll
[21:44] really
[21:45] know that you have
[21:50] overcome and you'll keep the
[21:54] promise of sitting on the throne.
[21:59] So we got to
[22:02] prove that we want to
[22:06] be and we got to
[22:09] show the power of the
[22:14] blood and we got to prove that we're not
[22:19] like those from.
[22:23] We got to show that we're a people that
[22:27] this world isn't worthy
[22:31] of. And we got to
[22:35] prove that we want
[22:39] it. And we got to
[22:42] show the power of the blood.
[22:49] And we have pro that we're not like
[22:52] those were made
[22:54] of. We've got to show that we're a
[22:59] people that this world isn't worthy
[23:03] of. We've got to show that we're a
[23:07] people that this world isn't worthy of.
[23:12] We've got to show that we're a people
[23:16] that this world isn't worthy of.

[32:49] Heat.
[33:00] I'm going to rise above it
[33:05] all. I'm going to rise above it
[33:09] all. Amen. How many going to rise above
[33:12] it tonight? Amen. At this time, let us
[33:15] all
[33:16] [Music]
[33:22] stand. And let us pray.
[33:28] Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us
[33:29] to be in your house. Lord, as the
[33:31] songwriter said, Lord, we're going to
[33:33] rise above it all. Lord, we're going to
[33:35] take wings one day and fly away to
[33:37] heaven and rise above all that's here,
[33:40] Lord, all the filth and the famine. And
[33:42] Lord, we ask that you, Lord, come down
[33:44] tonight in our midst, Lord, speak to us,
[33:47] Lord. Speak to each and every need, Lord
[33:49] Jesus. And Lord, move us out of the way,
[33:51] Lord, that you may get all the glory,
[33:54] all the honor, and the praise. Lord, we
[33:56] thank you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[34:00] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[34:02] we'll turn to Nehemiah chapter 4.
[34:05] [Music]
[34:36] Amen. Nehemiah chapter 4. When you got
[34:39] it, say amen. Amen. And it reads, "But
[34:42] it came to pass that when Simbal heard
[34:46] that he that we builded the wall, he was
[34:48] wroth and took great indignation and
[34:51] mocked the Jews. And he spake before his
[34:54] brethren, the armies of Samaria, and
[34:56] said, "What do these feeble Jews? Will
[34:59] they fortify themselves? Will they
[35:01] sacrifice? Will they make an end in a
[35:04] day? Will they revive the stones out of
[35:06] the heap of the rubbish which are
[35:08] burned?" Let's drop down to verse
[35:13] 7. But it came to pass that when Sam
[35:16] Ballad and Tobaya and the Arabians and
[35:19] the Amorites and the Ashdodites heard
[35:22] that the walls of the Jerusalem were
[35:24] made up that the breaches began to be
[35:27] stopped. Then they were ve very wroth
[35:30] and conspired all of them together to
[35:33] come and to fight against Jerusalem and
[35:35] to hinder it. Amen. God bless the read
[35:38] another word. You may be seated. I'm
[35:41] going to read down a little bit
[35:43] further. Nevertheless, we made our
[35:45] prayer unto our God and set a watch
[35:48] against them day and night because of
[35:51] them. And Judah and Judah said, "The
[35:53] strength of the bearers of the burden is
[35:55] decayed, and there is much rubbish so
[35:58] that we are not able to build the
[35:59] walls." And our adversary said, "They
[36:02] shall not know, neither see till we come
[36:05] in the midst among them." and slay them
[36:07] and caused the work to cease. And it
[36:10] came to pass that when the Jews were
[36:12] which dwelt by them came, they said they
[36:15] said unto us 10 times, "From all the
[36:18] places which ye shall return unto us,
[36:21] they will be upon
[36:27] you." Amen.
[36:32] And I want to drop down to 15 so we
[36:35] don't read the whole chapter. And it
[36:36] said, "And it came to pass that when our
[36:38] enemies heard that it was known unto us
[36:42] and God had brought their counsel to not
[36:44] that we returned all of us to the wall,
[36:47] everyone unto his work. And it came to
[36:50] pass from that time forth that half of
[36:52] my servants wrought in the work, and the
[36:54] other half of them held both the spear
[36:57] and the sh the spear, the shield, and
[37:00] the bows, and the harbing harbingers,
[37:03] and the rulers were behind all the house
[37:05] of Judah. They which build on the wall,
[37:09] and they that bear burdens, which those
[37:11] that laded, everyone with him, one in
[37:14] his hand, wrought in the work, and with
[37:16] the other hand held a weapon. Amen. God
[37:19] bless the reading of this word. Tonight,
[37:21] I'd like to speak on a little topic that
[37:23] I entitled, "Are you ready for battle?"
[37:26] Amen. Are you ready for battle? And I
[37:28] and I like this scripture
[37:30] because it remind me of what the Bible
[37:33] said said at the end time they would be
[37:35] building barns and they would be doing
[37:37] these things. But sometimes you got to
[37:39] be careful in all you're building and
[37:41] all you're getting that you forget to be
[37:43] ready for battle. Amen. Because no
[37:46] matter what you are doing, the devil is
[37:48] still on attack. No matter what you are
[37:51] doing, the devil is still trying to
[37:52] figure out how he can knock you down,
[37:55] how he can take you out. But see, the
[37:57] question I want to ask you is, are you
[37:59] ready for battle? See, it it got to a
[38:02] point that they weren't necessarily they
[38:04] weren't ready for battle when we first
[38:06] started. They didn't know that their
[38:08] enemies, it wasn't just one enemy. It
[38:10] was a multitude of enemies that decided
[38:12] that you know what, we heard about the
[38:14] progress that they were making. And many
[38:17] of times when you start making progress
[38:19] with God, here come the devil. As soon
[38:22] as you start to build something with
[38:23] God, here comes the devil. And the devil
[38:26] is coming to attack you because he knows
[38:28] that once the walls get built, it
[38:30] becomes that much harder for him to
[38:32] attack you. Once the walls once you
[38:34] become fortified in what you may believe
[38:37] and what you stand for, the devil has a
[38:39] hard time attacking that because there's
[38:42] a wall between him and you. There's a
[38:44] barrier between him and you. And once he
[38:47] realized that you realize there's
[38:48] someone there to help you build that
[38:50] wall, there's someone there that's going
[38:52] to stand beside you when you build that
[38:54] wall. There's someone's there that's
[38:56] going to uplift you while you're
[38:57] building that wall. The devil don't want
[38:59] you to realize that because that's when
[39:01] you have victory. But see, you got to be
[39:04] ready for battle. You can't be getting
[39:06] ready for battle. You got to be ready
[39:08] for battle. Because if you getting
[39:10] ready, it's already too late. It's
[39:12] already too late. The enemy will be upon
[39:14] you. They told them it was more than all
[39:17] of us combined together. That's hard.
[39:19] Our enemy was. See, but many of people,
[39:22] they they they they want to wait till
[39:24] they can see the enemy before they start
[39:26] getting ready. That's not the way that
[39:28] you're supposed to be. They they they
[39:30] decided that you know what even while we
[39:32] building we going to hold a spear in one
[39:34] hand. Say we might be building this but
[39:37] why why if you come n us we're not
[39:39] afraid to attack. We're not afraid to
[39:42] stand for what we believe. We're not
[39:43] afraid to stand for what God has given
[39:46] us. Amen. See they realized it was
[39:48] greater than them. It was a promise to
[39:50] them. God has sent a word and this is
[39:52] what they were supposed to do. They
[39:54] weren't worried about how many enemy was
[39:56] out there because they realized they had
[39:57] the ultimate secret weapon. They had God
[40:01] on their side. And see, when you got God
[40:03] on your side, see, that defeats all the
[40:06] devils and all the demons and all the
[40:07] enemies that may come against you. So
[40:09] you don't have to be afraid to fight.
[40:12] Sometimes you don't go to battle cuz you
[40:14] afraid of the war. You afraid of the
[40:16] battle. You afraid of the enemy that you
[40:19] going to face. And I thought about it
[40:21] and my mind went to David and Goliath. I
[40:24] said, you know that when once they got
[40:27] out there and and I want to read
[40:29] something that the prophet of God said.
[40:30] He
[40:31] said, he said, and so an army first is
[40:34] getting ready for a battle. So when an
[40:37] army goes out, the first thing they have
[40:39] to do, they have to get ready for battle
[40:41] first. They got to be a select. So they
[40:44] got some soldiers, they got to be
[40:46] dressed for fighting. They got to be
[40:49] trained for fighting. Say, you don't
[40:51] just go to battle without no training.
[40:53] Amen. You don't just go to war without
[40:55] no training. They don't ever say, "Hey,
[40:58] let's go to war." And they come to your
[40:59] door, knock, and say, "Let's go." They
[41:02] always got to put you through training
[41:03] first.
[41:05] But sometimes you don't realize when God
[41:07] is trying to train you. You don't
[41:10] realize that God is taking you through
[41:12] things because he knows the battle is
[41:13] coming. God didn't say, "Hey, David, go
[41:16] ahead and kill Goliath." That wasn't
[41:18] David's first battle. David had already
[41:21] faced the bear and the lion before he
[41:23] faced Goliath because God was training
[41:25] him for the for the battle that was to
[41:28] come. And and the prophet of God said,
[41:30] "And I believe that the greatest battle
[41:32] that was ever fought is now ready to go
[41:34] in action. I believe that God has been
[41:37] selecting his soldiers. And I believe
[41:39] that he's been dressing them and
[41:41] training them. And the battlefront is
[41:43] now set. Getting ready to start to
[41:48] start. See, see the battle is getting
[41:52] ready to start. And see, that's what
[41:54] happens that you can't get ready for the
[41:56] battle when the battle comes. You
[41:58] already got to be ready for battle. You
[42:01] can't be getting ready for the battle
[42:02] when the battle is upon you. You will
[42:05] be. It'll be a surprise attack to you.
[42:08] But see, the battles that's coming
[42:09] forward in the future is not a surprise.
[42:12] It shouldn't be to you. It shouldn't be
[42:14] to you. But it but it's something that
[42:16] you got to be getting ready for. Amen.
[42:18] Cuz I tell you, the devil is not getting
[42:20] smaller. It's only increasing. And you
[42:23] wonder why the attacks are increasing.
[42:25] Because the devil has multiplied. He got
[42:27] loosed out of the Euphrates, all the
[42:29] demons and devils of hell. And it's only
[42:31] specifically to attack you. Amen. It
[42:34] wasn't to attack everybody. It was
[42:36] specifically let loose to attack you.
[42:38] But you see that in this they said even
[42:41] though these devils were coming towards
[42:43] them, they realized that you know what?
[42:45] We got to be ready if they do decide to
[42:48] attack. We got to be ready and we and it
[42:51] wasn't just one. They stood together.
[42:53] They said we not going to fight by
[42:54] ourselves. We said that if if if you got
[42:57] the spirit behind me, I'm going to do
[42:59] the work and then we going to switch.
[43:01] And they had shifts. Said while I'm
[43:03] standing ready, you you working. And
[43:05] while you working, I'm going to stand
[43:06] ready. And when while I'm working, you
[43:09] stand ready. And then when you when I
[43:11] get tired, I'm going to take your place.
[43:13] And I'm going to stand there and watch
[43:14] over you. And I'm going to pray for you.
[43:16] And I'm going to watch you work. And I'm
[43:18] going to stand looking. And when the
[43:19] sound of trumpet, that's when everybody
[43:21] should come together. And we going to
[43:23] fight as one. See it. They knew that
[43:25] they couldn't fight by themselves to
[43:27] defeat this enemy. They couldn't fight
[43:29] by themselves cuz if they did they would
[43:31] get like they said um divided we fall.
[43:35] If they got separated they wasn't going
[43:37] to stand against this enemy. This enemy
[43:39] was too great. But if we stand together
[43:42] there was a unity that they decided to
[43:44] come together and said the only way for
[43:46] us to finish this wall is to come
[43:49] together. The only way for us to defeat
[43:51] this enemy is to stand together. The
[43:54] only way that we going to win this
[43:55] battle is to be on one accord. Amen.
[43:59] Listening to one voice and believing
[44:00] that Lord, you told us this is what you
[44:03] wanted us to do. We we ain't turn to
[44:06] this one or that one. This ain't a
[44:07] thought. This is something that you told
[44:09] us that you wanted us to do. So if you
[44:11] wanted us to do it, you provided a way
[44:13] for us to do it. And no enemy on the on
[44:16] the planet is going to be able to stop
[44:17] us from accomplishing what you want us
[44:19] to do. And see, that's the battle that
[44:21] you have to fight. You you have to go
[44:23] and decide, Lord, is this the battle
[44:25] that I'm supposed to be fighting? Cuz
[44:28] some battles you can be in and it ain't
[44:29] even worth it. It's some battles you can
[44:32] hear of and it ain't even worth it. When
[44:34] you look back and you realize you said,
[44:36] "I could have let that gone on. It
[44:38] wasn't that big of a deal." Amen. But
[44:40] you over here fighting a battle that
[44:41] didn't have that was
[44:43] inconsequential, that didn't have a lot
[44:45] of meaning to it, but you over here
[44:47] spending all your energy on something
[44:49] that didn't matter. Amen. But you see,
[44:52] see, you want to be fighting the right
[44:54] battles. What you got to go and search
[44:56] God in prayer and say, "Lord, what would
[44:58] you have me to do? Lord, what would you
[45:00] have me to do so I can fight the right
[45:02] battles? Cuz Lord, I don't have time to
[45:04] be spending wasting energy. Lord, I
[45:07] don't have time to be fighting battles
[45:08] that ain't mine. Lord, I don't have time
[45:11] to be fighting things that you don't
[45:12] want me to fight. If it's not going to
[45:14] build me and help me to get further in
[45:16] you, Lord, why am I doing it? Why am I
[45:19] fighting this battle when I could have
[45:20] just leave it alone and let you work it
[45:22] on out?" He and even the battle that I'm
[45:25] in, I know you going to work that one
[45:26] out cuz you sent me in the battle. Yeah.
[45:29] You wouldn't have sent me in it if you
[45:30] didn't have a way for me to get through
[45:32] it. And see, that's the battles that I
[45:34] want to fight. You can fight a losing
[45:36] battle and realize that I'm losing
[45:38] because I'm not in the right battle.
[45:41] Bless said, you could be in a knife
[45:43] fight and and somebody else got a gun.
[45:45] How you going to win?
[45:49] You got the wrong weapon for the wrong
[45:50] battle. Amen.
[45:52] said, "That's why you want to make sure
[45:54] that you in the right battle. And God
[45:56] don't ever put you in a battle that he
[45:59] put you in that he ain't provided a way
[46:01] for you to get out of when he put you in
[46:04] it." Now, sometimes you can put yourself
[46:06] in a battle. Amen. You can put yourself
[46:09] there and realize that you know what and
[46:12] God will have mercy on you and bring you
[46:14] out of it. He'll have mercy on you and
[46:16] bring you out of it. But sometimes some
[46:18] battles you can avoid by saying, "Lord,
[46:20] what would you have me to do? Amen.
[46:22] Lord, what would you have me to do? Cuz
[46:25] sometimes the devil will sit there and
[46:26] he'll lay a trap. He just waiting for
[46:29] you to cross it so you can fall right
[46:31] in. And he said, "I got you now." But
[46:34] see that God is still even in that he
[46:37] gave you grace and mercy. He gave you
[46:39] grace and mercy and understanding and
[46:42] all his plans that he ordered your steps
[46:44] if you were his child. If you come to
[46:46] him and said, "Lord, I surrender
[46:48] everything even in your mistakes." He
[46:50] said, he said he will order your steps.
[46:52] So when you fall in that trap, sometimes
[46:55] that's when the time that you get the
[46:56] closest to God. Amen. Cuz you realize
[46:59] that the only way that I'm going to
[47:01] survive this is that Lord, you bring me
[47:04] out of this. That Lord, you got to take
[47:07] me through this. And Lord, you got to
[47:09] bring me over this. Lord, you got to
[47:11] give me the overcoming power to to
[47:14] defeat this devil that's in front of me.
[47:16] Amen. Amen. Cuz some things happen by
[47:18] ignorance. But you see, God is the one
[47:21] that can deliver you out of them all.
[47:23] It's not me or you or it's not this
[47:25] person or that one. It's the Lord Jesus
[47:27] Christ that can deliver you out of them
[47:29] all. And some things is greater than the
[47:31] pastor. It's greater than this minister
[47:33] or preacher. But the only one you can
[47:35] turn to is God on the secret time in
[47:39] your secret place. You got to go to God
[47:41] and say, "Lord, this is the battle that
[47:42] I am in. And Lord, I don't know which
[47:45] way to go, but Lord, I need you to lead
[47:48] me through it. Lord, I don't know which
[47:50] way to turn, but Lord, I need you to
[47:52] bring me through this. Lord, I'm not
[47:54] going to make this battle if you don't
[47:56] bring me through this. If you don't lead
[47:58] me and guide me and give me direction,
[48:00] Lord, I'm not coming through this." Yes,
[48:02] Lord. Amen. See, when you get in those
[48:05] places in life, you realize how real God
[48:08] is to you. Amen. Amen. Not to somebody
[48:11] else, to you. And when God becomes real
[48:14] to you, you realize where all your help
[48:16] comes from. You become like Elijah's
[48:19] servant. Your eyes come open. You
[48:22] realize that there was something out
[48:23] there that was greater than you. That
[48:25] was stopping the devil from coming to
[48:27] take you out. There was something that
[48:29] was greater than you that was watching
[48:31] over you, that was keeping you, that was
[48:33] helping you, that was leading and
[48:35] guiding you. Even in your in your wrong
[48:37] moments, he was still there keeping you
[48:40] from allowing it to go worse than what
[48:41] it was. Amen. Amen. Amen. See, sometimes
[48:45] you got to have those experiences where
[48:47] you recognize God was there. Amen. And
[48:50] if you don't have if you don't recognize
[48:52] it, just think back over your life. Yes,
[48:55] Lord. Just think back over. Think of the
[48:57] worst moment in your life. And if you
[49:00] think of it, you probably can still see
[49:02] God there. Yes, sir. Amen. And if you
[49:05] didn't think about it, you just didn't
[49:06] think hard enough
[49:10] because God was still there. He was. But
[49:13] see, are you ready for the battle that
[49:15] is to come? Thank you, Jesus. See, you
[49:17] got to be prepared. It see God bless you
[49:20] cuz you might have been ignorant in that
[49:21] time. But that is becoming a time where
[49:24] it's no
[49:25] more. Ignorance is not bliss. You can't
[49:28] you can't use that excuse no more. Amen.
[49:30] You can't use that and say, "Well, I
[49:32] didn't know
[49:36] cuz it becomes a times where that ain't
[49:38] no excuse no more. Amen. That's not
[49:40] something I can continue to pass on and
[49:42] say, "I didn't know." Well, then you
[49:44] turn right. I didn't know. And then you
[49:45] turn left. I didn't know. Some things
[49:47] you had to know or or think of and you
[49:50] just went past the stop sign. Say,
[49:52] "Officer, I didn't know it was a stop
[49:54] sign." Well, you might have not seen the
[49:56] first one, but then there was a blinking
[49:58] light above you and there was the cars
[50:01] over here that had stopped and this one
[50:03] had stopped and that one had stopped.
[50:05] So, what made you think that? And the
[50:07] person in front of you stopped. So, what
[50:09] made you think that you can just go on
[50:10] on through? I don't know.
[50:14] The officer going to look at you and
[50:15] say, "Um, well, I got to give you this
[50:18] ticket." Because it was no excuse. Amen.
[50:23] much less if that's the natural. What
[50:25] about the spiritual? Amen. What makes
[50:28] you think that God has just continue to
[50:30] say you can go on on by? It's okay. You
[50:32] can go on on by. That's okay. If you can
[50:34] go on on by, that's okay. The pastor was
[50:37] speaking on Sunday said it's a holy
[50:38] city. Amen. And everything ain't going
[50:41] to pass through there. Amen. People
[50:43] think, "Hey, I'm going to do this and
[50:45] I'm going to go, hey, I'm going to
[50:46] heaven." It ain't going to be like that.
[50:49] Come on now. It can't be like that
[50:52] because God is holy. That's right. God
[50:54] is perfect. And he said, "Be you perfect
[50:56] as I am perfect." So if you ain't
[50:59] perfect, then how you think you going to
[51:00] get in?
[51:03] How you think God just going to say,
[51:05] "Hey, that's fine. You can go on in." If
[51:06] that was the case, he would have let a
[51:08] whole slew of people on in.
[51:12] But he said it' be a few that make it.
[51:15] Ain't going to be no whole slew that
[51:16] make. It's going to be a few that make
[51:18] it. Amen.
[51:20] and said, "Are you ready for that battle
[51:23] that's going to come?" Cuz I can tell
[51:25] you, your battle might not be my battle,
[51:27] but your battle is you going to have
[51:29] one. You definitely going to have one.
[51:32] And you got to be ready when that battle
[51:34] come. And and and and that battle might
[51:37] be so intense that you might barely make
[51:39] it.
[51:41] You might barely make it through that
[51:42] battle, but that battle's gonna come.
[51:45] And when that battle comes, you can't be
[51:47] saying, "I got to get ready." Well, let
[51:49] me go find my Bible and read my Bible
[51:51] now cuz cuz Lord, it's getting hard.
[51:56] You got to know it by then.
[51:59] It ain't no time to go search. You can
[52:02] search it, but now it's the time to know
[52:03] it. It's a time to go back and and and
[52:06] lean on your experience with God. It's a
[52:09] time to go back and say, "Lord, I seen
[52:11] you do this. I've seen you do this. And
[52:13] Lord, I know you can carry me through
[52:15] this.
[52:16] That's the time that you got to lean on
[52:18] your experience with God and say, "Lord,
[52:20] I when I prayed for this, I seen you do
[52:22] this. And when I prayed for this, I seen
[52:24] you do this." So Lord, I know you are
[52:26] God that answers prayers. I'm not
[52:28] wondering, "Are you a God that answers
[52:30] prayers?" I know you are a God that
[52:31] answers prayers. And I can't run to
[52:33] pastor to ask him cuz pastor got his own
[52:35] things that he dealing with. Amen. Amen.
[52:38] Amen. Right. Amen. The brother so and so
[52:41] got his own thing. Now, he can pray with
[52:43] you, but sometimes it's got to be on
[52:45] your prayers. It's got to be on your
[52:47] faith. It's got to be that you was ready
[52:49] for the battle and you was ready for the
[52:52] battle. And they said when two or three
[52:54] are gathered in them there, he would be
[52:56] in the midst. So, you can touch and
[52:58] agree with someone, but if you ain't got
[53:00] it for yourself, it's hard cuz they not
[53:02] only fighting for themselves, they
[53:04] fighting for you, too.
[53:07] And you wonder why, hey, why things
[53:09] ain't moving? Where have you checked
[53:10] yourself and say am I ready for battle?
[53:14] Am I ready to to to face the battle? Am
[53:16] I am I ready to take these things
[53:19] undertake these things? Did I have my
[53:21] spear sharp enough? Did I have my sword
[53:24] on my side or was it laying somewhere?
[53:27] And now when the when the enemy trying
[53:29] to break through the door, I'm trying to
[53:30] search where I put it. Where' I put it?
[53:33] I think it might be over here. No, no,
[53:34] no. I think it's over here. That's too
[53:36] late. The enemy in the house. Amen.
[53:39] That's right. The enemy is in the house.
[53:41] Amen. So, what what does a weapon any
[53:44] good is when the time that you need it,
[53:46] you can't find it.
[53:52] That just shows you wasn't ready.
[53:55] And sometimes you go through things
[53:57] where it'll be you'll be warned here and
[53:59] you'll be warned there and you'll be
[54:01] warned here. Hey, get ready. Hey, get
[54:03] ready. I think it's time as the Lord
[54:06] comes, he knock at your door. I think I
[54:08] think you need to wake up. And he'll
[54:11] send a little something to kind of push
[54:12] you. And then he'll send a little
[54:14] something else to kind of get you here.
[54:16] Hey, hey, you start praying over here.
[54:18] And then once you come through it, you
[54:19] forget and go
[54:22] back. And then when something else come,
[54:24] you start reading your Bible every day
[54:26] and praying every day. And then once you
[54:28] come through, you say, "Thank you,
[54:30] Jesus." And then you go
[54:32] back. Then a little bit bigger storm
[54:35] comes. And then you go back to Lord
[54:37] Jesus, I need you. Mhm. Every day you
[54:39] you get you get faithful. Real faithful
[54:41] real quick. Boy, you coming to every
[54:43] service. You're early for service cuz
[54:46] cuz you realize that that something got
[54:48] to move. And then you forget blesses.
[54:52] And then and then something else comes.
[54:54] But see the battle that's coming, it
[54:56] might not let up. Amen. So how you know
[54:59] that you ain't got time to be to have a
[55:02] L time? See, at that point in time, you
[55:05] got to point back and say, "Lord, Lord,
[55:07] I I I was searching daily. And Lord, I I
[55:11] was I was doing the things that you
[55:13] asked me to do. And Lord, even in my
[55:16] moments, Lord, you came down and you and
[55:17] you spoke to me and you helped me
[55:19] through and you brought me through
[55:20] this." See, the battles, they was a
[55:22] daily battle. But the every single day
[55:24] you was growing stronger. Every single
[55:27] day you was growing stronger. Every
[55:29] single day you realized the weapons that
[55:31] you had. A weapon ain't good if you
[55:33] don't know how to use it either. If you
[55:35] can't find it, that don't do you no
[55:37] good. If you got one and you don't know
[55:39] how to use it, that don't do you no
[55:41] good.
[55:43] It's just something that's a
[55:44] placeholder.
[55:46] But the most powerful person is they
[55:48] know what a weapon is and they know how
[55:49] to use it.
[55:51] That's when you wonder why the devil run
[55:53] for some and stay with others.
[55:57] Cuz some people realize the weapon that
[55:59] they got. Amen. Amen. Some people
[56:01] understand how to use the weapon that
[56:03] they got. Amen. See, that's the
[56:06] difference.
[56:07] Some know the weapon that they have and
[56:10] they also know the one that's backing
[56:12] them up. See, they ain't worried about
[56:14] it when they come. They see, yeah, yeah,
[56:16] it might it might cause them to to get
[56:19] down on their knees. They might seem
[56:21] like they pray, but you don't realize
[56:22] they was always praying. Amen. They was
[56:25] always staying close to God. You didn't
[56:27] see the behind the night scenes in the
[56:29] middle of the night where they was
[56:30] crying to the Lord. You didn't see that.
[56:33] But now you see it more openly because
[56:35] it it because it's different when you
[56:38] going through battle.
[56:41] Nobody knows or the training that takes
[56:43] place with a soldier behind the scenes
[56:45] till he goes into battle. Amen. People
[56:48] don't realize like when you have the
[56:50] elite forces of the elite how all they
[56:53] train they train for years and years to
[56:56] be able to handle one battle. They might
[56:59] only fight one battle in their
[57:01] lifetime. But they training year after
[57:04] year, day after day because they got to
[57:06] stay in shape. They got to stay in
[57:08] training. Cuz when they go to battle,
[57:09] it's life or death. It ain't just, hey,
[57:12] we going out here to play play with some
[57:14] water guns. Hey, we going out here. We
[57:17] going we going to hit each other across
[57:19] the head real nice cuz the enemy is a
[57:21] nice person, you know. So he just going
[57:24] to he just going to come over here and
[57:25] hit me with a little light stick and I'm
[57:27] going to hit him back with a little
[57:28] light stick and we just going to go back
[57:29] to camp. That ain't the that ain't the
[57:32] enemy. When the enemy comes out there,
[57:34] he ready to take you out. So you have to
[57:37] have the same mentality. And they train
[57:40] every single day to gain that mentality
[57:43] that when the enemy comes, there's got
[57:45] to be something that stands up against
[57:47] it. When that enemy comes, there's got
[57:49] to be something that stands up against
[57:51] it. If there's nothing that stands up
[57:53] against it, that enemy is going to run
[57:54] you over. I don't care how much better
[57:57] you think that you are than that enemy.
[57:59] That enemy is going to run you over
[58:01] eventually cuz he going to go and say,
[58:03] "Hey, they defense is weak right here."
[58:05] And they gonna get all their friends to
[58:07] say, "This is a spot to attack. This is
[58:10] the spot to attack. And when I get
[58:11] inside, when I get inside, I'm going to
[58:14] let you in. I'm going to let this one
[58:16] in. And I'm going to let this one in."
[58:18] Said, I think the pro I think it was
[58:21] said that when when when one goes back,
[58:24] he can he comes back with seven more.
[58:27] He comes back cuz he said, "If I can't
[58:29] get in, let me bring my friends and let
[58:31] all them try." That's right.
[58:33] because it's some because he knows that
[58:36] as long as you have God on your side and
[58:39] you realize that he's on your side,
[58:41] there was nothing that he can do.
[58:43] There's nothing that he can do. And when
[58:46] and when you realize that Lord, you on
[58:48] my side, that when I go into battle, I
[58:51] don't have to worry about am I going to
[58:54] win or not. Amen. That gives you a
[58:56] certain level of confidence. If you go
[58:58] to an interview and you realize that,
[59:00] hey, they already going to offer me the
[59:01] job. You was so
[59:03] relaxed. Somebody done told you, "Hey,
[59:06] they done looked at your resume and told
[59:07] you, hey, yeah, you a great candidate.
[59:09] All you got to do is do this interview."
[59:11] Boy, you going there, you said, "Well,
[59:12] this is a wonderful
[59:14] day." Cuz you you have no stress. Amen.
[59:18] Cuz the job is yours. Amen. If if you
[59:21] believe them,
[59:24] can't always listen to some
[59:27] people. But if if it's a trusted person
[59:30] and you realize, hey, when I go to this
[59:33] interview, if I go in there and do well,
[59:36] the job is mine. And you needed a job.
[59:39] Oh yeah. You go in there, you say, all
[59:41] the pressure is off. It's the reason why
[59:44] the pressure is on because you don't
[59:45] know the answer. The whole reason that
[59:48] you are stressed out is because you
[59:49] don't know the answer. But if you know
[59:51] the answer before, if you know the if
[59:54] you go and you take a test and you
[59:56] already know all the answers to the
[59:58] test, boy, that's a wonderful test,
[59:59] ain't it? You go in there, you say, I'm
[1:00:02] going to make a A. Everybody else is
[1:00:04] like, but but you was struggling. You
[1:00:06] said, I'm going to make a A and they
[1:00:08] just looking at you, we going to
[1:00:11] see. But you see, when you go in there
[1:00:13] cuz you got a supreme confidence that I
[1:00:16] know all the answers. It's the same
[1:00:18] thing when you have a battle in your
[1:00:20] life. When God is on your side, say if
[1:00:24] you are ready for that battle, you going
[1:00:26] in there and you march into that battle.
[1:00:29] Say you marching into that battle cuz
[1:00:31] you realize we already won the victory.
[1:00:34] We already overcome. We already It don't
[1:00:37] matter how bad this battle is going to
[1:00:39] get. Cuz it might get bad. You might be
[1:00:42] stumbling through the battle, but you
[1:00:44] know that I'm coming through. Jacob had
[1:00:46] to wrestle with that angel all night
[1:00:48] long. And when he came out, he had a
[1:00:50] limp, but he had overcome. Amen. See,
[1:00:53] Jacob, he realized that, hey, I'm not
[1:00:55] going to let you go until you bless me.
[1:00:58] See, that's sometimes why you got to go
[1:00:59] in your battle. Said, I'm not going to
[1:01:01] come out of this until I win. I'm not
[1:01:04] going to come up out of this until I've
[1:01:06] overcome. I'm not going to let this
[1:01:08] moment go until God, you do something
[1:01:10] for me. Amen. And when you get to those
[1:01:13] points, you'll see God do some
[1:01:15] extraordinary things for you cuz you
[1:01:17] realize that Lord, I've come to the
[1:01:19] point that I can't go back and I can't
[1:01:21] go to the side. I got to go through this
[1:01:23] Red Sea and there's no other way that I
[1:01:26] can turn but watch you do something
[1:01:28] miraculous.
[1:01:30] I got to see you do something miraculous
[1:01:32] because there's nowhere for me to go.
[1:01:34] Amen. There's no I I was prepared as I
[1:01:36] could be, Lord, and the enemy is still
[1:01:38] too great. I had studied. I had prayed.
[1:01:41] And I was more prepared than I could be.
[1:01:43] And the enemy was still too big. He had
[1:01:46] me trapped.
[1:01:48] But still, there was a way. Still there
[1:01:51] is a way. Even when you feel trapped,
[1:01:53] there is a way. God has a way that's
[1:01:55] prepared for you that you can walk
[1:01:57] through on dry land. And said when they
[1:01:59] walked through on dry land that they
[1:02:01] chased them after them and the Lord
[1:02:03] swallowed them up and they said they saw
[1:02:05] that enemy no more. Amen. You didn't
[1:02:09] realize that when you walked through on
[1:02:10] the dry land, God was destroying a
[1:02:12] dynasty. Amen.
[1:02:15] That's what the Egyptians were. They
[1:02:16] were a dynasty. They were the people
[1:02:18] that ruled the ancient world
[1:02:21] at that time. And when they went through
[1:02:23] the Red Sea, they were no more the same.
[1:02:26] They were conquered after that. You
[1:02:29] didn't realize that God God was going to
[1:02:31] take you through that so that when you
[1:02:33] came through that that devil couldn't
[1:02:34] touch you no more.
[1:02:36] He would never you would never have to
[1:02:37] fight that battle no more cuz you was on
[1:02:40] a pathway where God was taking you where
[1:02:42] he wanted you to go. God was taking you
[1:02:44] where you wanted to go. And as long as
[1:02:46] you didn't doubt that God was going to
[1:02:48] take you in that promised land,
[1:02:51] God had a way that was prepared for you
[1:02:53] to go there. God has a way that's
[1:02:55] prepared for you to go there. Sometimes,
[1:02:58] even when you are prepared, God has to
[1:03:00] show you that even though you come to
[1:03:02] the point that you didn't think that you
[1:03:04] was going to overcome, he said, "I still
[1:03:06] got a way." Even though you didn't think
[1:03:08] that you was ever going to win that
[1:03:10] fight, God said, "I still got a way."
[1:03:12] Even though you didn't think that, "Hey,
[1:03:14] I was ever going to make it through
[1:03:15] this, God still had a way." You just got
[1:03:18] to be like, look up and say, "Lord, I
[1:03:20] need you to provide the way for me.
[1:03:22] Lord, I need you to show me the way cuz
[1:03:25] I can't see it through the Red Sea.
[1:03:27] Lord, the waves are tossing and the and
[1:03:29] there's big things in the water. I can
[1:03:31] see that, but I can't see how you going
[1:03:33] to make dry land. But you see, when I
[1:03:35] got to a point that I realized I didn't
[1:03:37] have to see it. All I had to do is
[1:03:39] believe that you was going to do it.
[1:03:41] Hey, that changed your perception. That
[1:03:44] changed how I walked. That changed even
[1:03:45] my thought about my enemy. Cuz I wasn't
[1:03:48] looking at him no more. Cuz you had my
[1:03:50] back covered. See, he ain't never give
[1:03:52] you nothing for your back cuz he covered
[1:03:54] it. Amen. And said, when I realized
[1:03:57] that, all I had to do was lift my hands
[1:03:59] up and walk forward. And lift my hands
[1:04:03] up and walk forward. Cuz when you lift
[1:04:05] your hands up is a sign of surrender.
[1:04:07] Yes. Anytime you see someone surrender,
[1:04:10] they raise the right flag and they lift
[1:04:12] their hands up. And when you surrender
[1:04:14] to God like that, God can do things and
[1:04:17] allow you to come out of things that you
[1:04:19] didn't think was possible. All you had
[1:04:21] to do is lift your hand up and say,
[1:04:23] "Lord, Lord, Lord, I need help. Lord, I
[1:04:26] surrender to you. Lord, I give you
[1:04:28] everything. Lord, Lord, I surrender to
[1:04:31] you. Lord, Lord, I want you to be the
[1:04:33] ruler of my life." See, when you do
[1:04:35] that, God can bring you through. You can
[1:04:38] come through on dry land and that enemy
[1:04:40] that's chasing you, you'll see them no
[1:04:42] more.
[1:04:45] See, God has a way that even when you
[1:04:48] are prepared, he said, "I made a way of
[1:04:49] escape. I made a way that that you can't
[1:04:53] understand and it's not for you to
[1:04:55] understand. All I want you to do is
[1:04:57] believe."
[1:04:59] That's all I want you to do is to
[1:05:00] believe. said the prophet of God said,
[1:05:03] "If you can get the people to believe,
[1:05:05] then all things are possible." That's
[1:05:07] why the angel loved that song because
[1:05:09] all you have to do is believe that Lord,
[1:05:11] you can do it. And then you got to keep
[1:05:14] that faith that even though I can't see
[1:05:16] it, Lord, you still going to do it. And
[1:05:18] when I can't see it, Lord, you still
[1:05:20] going to do it. And you can't let your
[1:05:22] faith waver that God is not able to do
[1:05:24] what he said he was going to do. And
[1:05:26] when you don't let your faith waver, you
[1:05:28] can be in the barber shop when you see
[1:05:30] God do it.
[1:05:33] It don't matter when he does it. It's
[1:05:35] that he promised that he would do it.
[1:05:38] See that that sometimes we get so
[1:05:40] anxious trying to figure out when God is
[1:05:42] going to do
[1:05:43] it. And and sometimes that can make your
[1:05:46] faith waver because you you said it's
[1:05:48] meant too long. But was it too long for
[1:05:50] Lazarus?
[1:05:52] He was in the ground for 4 days before
[1:05:54] Jesus showed up. And when he showed up,
[1:05:57] he said the disciples asked him, "Why
[1:05:58] are we going to see him? He already
[1:06:00] dead." And Jesus said, "He sleepeth."
[1:06:02] Yes. Because Jesus knew what was going
[1:06:05] to come. So is he ever too late?
[1:06:09] Is your battle too great for him?
[1:06:13] But see, you got to be ready when the
[1:06:15] battle comes. See, the whole point that
[1:06:18] I I wanted to hope that you got is that
[1:06:20] when my battle comes, Lord, I want to be
[1:06:23] ready. Yes. Cuz I got a battle that I
[1:06:25] got to fight and you got a battle that
[1:06:27] you got to fight. And sometimes you got
[1:06:30] to touch and agree and come together and
[1:06:31] say, "Lord, I'm here because I don't
[1:06:33] have strength to fight no more. But
[1:06:35] Lord, I need you to give me strength.
[1:06:37] And Lord, I need for I need to pray for
[1:06:39] strength. Lord, give me strength to
[1:06:41] fight the battle. Lord, give me wisdom
[1:06:44] for how to handle the battle that I'm
[1:06:46] facing. Lord, guide my footstep. Guide
[1:06:48] my tongue. Lord, guide my actions. Lord,
[1:06:51] Lord, in this battle that I'm fighting,
[1:06:53] Lord, Lord, touch me that I can
[1:06:55] overcome, Lord, do something in me that
[1:06:58] when I fight this battle, Lord, I know
[1:07:00] that you coming and you going to rescue
[1:07:02] me out of it. See, but he's the God that
[1:07:05] never fails. He's the God that never
[1:07:08] leave you helpless. He'll never leave
[1:07:10] you alone because he said, "I'll never
[1:07:12] leave you and I'll never forsake you."
[1:07:15] So tonight, I ask, are you ready for the
[1:07:17] battle? And if you're not ready for the
[1:07:20] for the battle, tonight is your
[1:07:22] opportunity to say, "Lord, prepare me to
[1:07:24] be a sanctuary, Lord, pure and holy,
[1:07:28] tried and true, and with thanksgiving,
[1:07:30] let me be a living sanctuary for you."
[1:07:34] See, that's what God wants to do if you
[1:07:36] will let him. If you say, "Lord, when my
[1:07:38] battle comes, I want to be ready." And
[1:07:41] then if you say that, I believe the Lord
[1:07:43] will prepare you for your battle. I
[1:07:46] believe that the Lord will do something
[1:07:47] in your life that'll change it. And
[1:07:49] that'll make you and you make that
[1:07:51] decision that God allow you to grow and
[1:07:53] become to a certain point that you can
[1:07:56] say, "Lord, I'm ready for the battle."
[1:07:58] Amen. I'm no longer afraid. When the
[1:08:02] enemy comes in the silent of the night,
[1:08:04] I know that you prepared a secret place
[1:08:06] for me. Oh yes. I know that you got a
[1:08:09] place that's prepared for me. And when I
[1:08:11] turn to the right, I don't have to
[1:08:13] worry. When I turn to the left and can't
[1:08:15] see nowhere to go, I don't have to worry
[1:08:17] cuz I know that even in when I can't see
[1:08:19] a way that you got a way of escape.
[1:08:22] Amen.
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:31] Thank
[1:08:45] you. You fight
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:50] on. Amen. You say you fight on. Amen.
[1:08:54] Amen. Keep fighting. Amen. Amen. If you
[1:08:58] fight the good fight of faith, you can
[1:08:59] lay hold on eternal life. Amen. He said
[1:09:03] the battle is not yours, but it's the
[1:09:04] Lord. Amen. Must be ready. We thank God.
[1:09:08] Sister Linda, we're glad to see you in
[1:09:10] the night. Appreciate
[1:09:13] everyone.
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:16] Amen. We know that there's an oncoming
[1:09:19] storm and the battle of Armlagettton is
[1:09:23] look like it's heating up over there and
[1:09:26] Ukraine and different parts of the world
[1:09:28] and they're battling. They're having
[1:09:30] trade wars and all kind of wars going
[1:09:34] on. But you got to realize it could come
[1:09:38] nigh even the effects of these battles
[1:09:41] can come to your house. Not just to
[1:09:45] America, but to you as individuals.
[1:09:47] Amen. These these things that are
[1:09:50] happening, these walls that are taking
[1:09:52] place could come nigh to you. So you
[1:09:56] must prepare yourself.
[1:09:59] Amen. God can hide you in the cliff of
[1:10:02] the rock. Yes, Lord. Are you with me?
[1:10:05] Amen. So you
[1:10:07] said, "The wall shall encamp against me,
[1:10:10] and this will I be confident. One thing
[1:10:13] have I desired of the Lord, that will I
[1:10:15] seek after, to behold the beauty of the
[1:10:18] Lord, in the inquiring his temple. For
[1:10:21] in the time of trouble, he should hide
[1:10:23] me. Amen. He said, "Hide me in the
[1:10:26] secrets of his tabernacle shall he hide
[1:10:28] me." He should set me up upon a rock,
[1:10:32] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:10:34] my enemies around about me. Amen. Why?
[1:10:38] Because he said, "The Lord is my light
[1:10:40] and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The
[1:10:44] Lord is the strength of my life. Whom
[1:10:46] shall I be afraid? Amen. And when the
[1:10:50] wicked, even my enemies, Amen. You know,
[1:10:54] Amen. God, he got you. Amen. Oh, yeah.
[1:10:58] God bless you tonight. We're not going
[1:11:00] to prolong the time. We appreciate the
[1:11:02] word tonight. Amen.
[1:11:04] [Music]

[1:11:10] Hallelujah.

[1:11:15] tonight.
[1:11:17] And as we look to you
[1:11:19] tonight,
[1:11:21] Lord, we ask you, oh God, to prepare
[1:11:24] each and every one of us.
[1:11:27] Help us to prepare ourselves
[1:11:30] for you said the bride has made herself
[1:11:32] ready. Lord, Father, may your bride make
[1:11:37] herself ready.
[1:11:39] Lord, you

[1:11:45] should prepare for war." Yes, Lord.
[1:11:48] Lord, so Father, in the name of Jesus,

[1:13:14] life, hallelujah. If you haven't given
[1:13:17] Jesus Christ your heart,
[1:13:22] why don't you
[1:13:23] prepare yourself because
[1:13:26] surely the war's going on now.
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:33] There are natural wars going on and
[1:13:35] there's spiritual wars going on.
[1:13:42] If you're here tonight and you haven't
[1:13:44] given Jesus your
[1:13:46] life, why don't you do it
[1:13:49] now?
[1:13:51] Jesus, forgive me of my sin. Come into
[1:13:54] my
[1:13:55] life. Jesus, I need you now.
[1:13:59] I want to be ready. Yes, Lord Jesus. I
[1:14:02] don't want to get ready. I want to be
[1:14:04] ready. Yes.
[1:14:06] For you said the bride made herself
[1:14:08] ready.
[1:14:11] His
[1:14:13] wife. So, Father, I pray you give peace.
[1:14:16] I pray you touch these
[1:14:18] lives and every heart that is open
[1:14:22] tonight in Jesus
[1:14:25] name. Amen.

[1:14:30] repent, be baptized, every one of you in
[1:14:33] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:14:35] remission of sin, and you shall receive
[1:14:37] the gift of the Holy
[1:14:38] Ghost. If you have not been baptized in
[1:14:41] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:43] Christ

[1:14:49] and as a said, I want to be baptized in
[1:14:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We

[1:14:58] Jesus

[1:15:11] God for the
[1:15:12] word. God bless you tonight. Let us bow

[1:15:28] us. May you bless Brother Caleb, Lord,
[1:15:31] in his ministry,
[1:15:33] Lord. May you continue to be with him,
[1:15:37] Lord. May you speak through him and
[1:15:40] speak to
[1:15:44] him in Jesus Christ's name. Bless every
[1:15:48] heart that press the way out.
[1:15:51] those that are listening in, the Lord
[1:15:54] may something said that would touch
[1:15:57] their lives, make a difference for
[1:16:00] them. And as we depart this place
[1:16:03] tonight, whenever your
[1:16:05] presence, may you go with each and
[1:16:08] everyone till we meet again. In the name
[1:16:11] of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
