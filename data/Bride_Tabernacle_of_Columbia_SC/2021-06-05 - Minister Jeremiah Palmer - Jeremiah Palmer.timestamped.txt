[33:16] and a people more than thou
[33:20] be not afraid of them
[33:23] for the lord thy god is with thee amen
[33:27] which brought thee out of the land of
[33:29] egypt
[33:30] and it shall be when ye are come nigh
[33:33] into the battle
[33:35] that the priest shall approach and speak
[33:38] unto the people
[33:40] and shall say unto them hear o
[33:43] bride tabernacle
[33:47] hear israel he approached this day into
[33:51] the battle
[33:52] against your enemies let not your heart
[33:55] faint fear not

[34:57] given to us
[34:59] in the name of jesus christ amen
[35:03] and amen let me see
[35:11] i want to just speak just for a few
[35:13] minutes tonight
[35:17] and i entitled this as i was thinking on
[35:20] war
[35:20] time
[35:24] but then i want to use as your day of
[35:28] battle
[35:30] your day of battle
[35:34] we understand
[35:39] and i believe that we are our witness to
[35:42] realize that
[35:45] we're in a battlefield
[35:53] the word battle it means
[35:57] an extinct extended contest
[36:01] or struggle
[36:06] to secede or survive
[36:11] a contest between two forces
[36:17] an extended
[36:21] battle
[36:25] we're in the hour
[36:31] that we must understand that
[36:37] we came to fight
[36:43] but in fighting
[36:46] you must be armed
[36:51] we look through the church ages and the
[36:53] dark ages of history
[36:57] every age and every generation had
[37:01] something they had to contend with
[37:06] and god knowing that they
[37:10] had to deal with that
[37:13] spirit of that particular age
[37:17] didn't leave them without a weapon
[37:21] church i like to say you got a weapon
[37:26] i know we are facing as he said horses
[37:29] and
[37:30] chariots and word demon powers
[37:35] bible saying ephesians we're not
[37:38] fighting against flesh and blood but as
[37:42] principalities
[37:45] powers rulers of of darkness
[37:50] you can feel the intensity of the spirit
[37:54] that are surrounding you and oppressing
[37:57] against
[37:58] us even when you
[38:02] sleep the demonstration bother you
[38:06] everywhere you turn there is some type
[38:09] of
[38:10] a spirit that is constantly
[38:13] trying to suppress you
[38:21] but thank god he didn't leave
[38:24] us alone
[38:30] we understand that
[38:33] if we don't rise up and fight
[38:38] we're going to be destroyed
[38:42] but i want you to really understand that
[38:45] the battle isn't yours though
[38:50] it's the lord's the bible said when the
[38:54] enemy comes in like a flood
[38:58] he said the spirit of the lord will
[39:02] raise up a standard against that spirit
[39:08] cover 19 ain't no match for jesus christ
[39:14] come on somebody we are not
[39:17] fighting with physical armor but is
[39:20] spiritual
[39:21] [Music]
[39:24] oh my i'm glad
[39:27] god didn't leave us to fight our own
[39:30] battle church
[39:32] he know that we could never we are not a
[39:36] match
[39:38] for what is going on in this hour
[39:42] we are not a match for these demon
[39:44] powers
[39:47] medicine can't even uh uh
[39:50] heal all this that we got going on
[39:55] they don't have the right antidote they
[39:57] don't have the right
[39:58] answers they are just guessing with the
[40:01] people
[40:02] but god got an answer
[40:06] he got an antidote that has been tested
[40:11] proven and been
[40:15] shown that i have the victory
[40:20] not even death
[40:23] can hold him down it's been proven
[40:29] amen is that if your life is hidden in
[40:32] christ
[40:33] you can never die
[40:38] death only takes you in the presence of
[40:41] god
[40:43] and if the same spirit being you
[40:47] that was in christ it will quicken
[40:50] your mortal body we need the quickening
[40:53] power
[40:59] your day of battle
[41:02] we all kind of look like how things used
[41:04] to be and
[41:05] what happened to the old saints and
[41:08] how they had to trust in the lord
[41:13] with all their heart all their mind
[41:18] lean not to their own understanding
[41:21] don't
[41:21] lean to your ability don't don't lead to
[41:25] your success
[41:26] or whatever you may do trust in
[41:29] the lord
[41:36] looking at the standpoint from the old
[41:38] testament
[41:41] how what they had to went through
[41:46] not even yet seeing
[41:50] what god was going to do but just
[41:52] holding
[41:53] fast to god's unchanging word
[42:00] did it had what we got now
[42:04] they had a substitute of a sacrifice of
[42:07] a lamb
[42:08] we get a perfect sacrifice
[42:12] we got a sacrifice that has been torn
[42:16] has been beaten has been cast
[42:19] down yet he said
[42:23] not even death can hold my body down
[42:27] not only that hell couldn't even stop
[42:30] him
[42:31] he went to hell where the devil had the
[42:35] keys
[42:36] at sea he had to go there
[42:41] because satan hold a power a key
[42:44] to death that nobody ever could get out
[42:48] of it
[42:50] oh but our champion the lord jesus
[42:52] christ
[42:54] he went to the region of the loss
[42:59] he went to where satan
[43:02] had the keys and and you know keys go to
[43:05] a door
[43:08] and if he didn't get those keys satan
[43:12] will still
[43:13] have that power
[43:16] but when he went down there that time
[43:18] and
[43:19] knocked on that door and the devil no
[43:22] doubt were wondering
[43:24] who is this
[43:27] he thought he had finished everything
[43:30] but he forgot who was the lord god
[43:35] almighty
[43:37] and when he went the devil no doubt
[43:42] maybe peeped out
[43:45] and probably said to himself i thought i
[43:48] got rid of you
[43:51] but he forget you can't kill the lord
[43:55] god
[43:56] almighty he said i lay my body down
[44:00] and i pick it up
[44:04] see that was god almighty flesh
[44:08] but he thought it was just a prophet
[44:11] just another man with a lot of words but
[44:15] they have seen and they've heard his
[44:18] his authority they said that we
[44:22] never heard a man speak with such
[44:25] authority
[44:27] why because he knew who he was
[44:32] he knew that his purpose had come that
[44:36] i must go to calvary
[44:42] oh my sometimes i wonder
[44:48] whether we really got a real true
[44:51] glimpse of what happened that day
[44:56] let me go to one place in colossians
[45:00] oh my
[45:09] i believe it's colossians 3.
[45:18] yes 14 and 15.
[45:23] it says blotting out
[45:27] the handwriting for artists that was
[45:29] against us
[45:32] which was contrary to us and took
[45:35] it out of the way nailing it to the
[45:39] cross
[45:42] in having spoiled principalities
[45:45] and powers he made a show of them
[45:49] openly triumphing
[45:53] over them god
[45:59] triumphing over principalities
[46:05] and powers
[46:09] artisan that was against us
[46:13] that nature of sin he took it to the
[46:17] cross
[46:20] and once and for all he
[46:23] cleared us oh my i'm too glad tonight
[46:29] that
[46:29] you have been cleared you've been
[46:33] pardoned there's nothing against you
[46:38] the blood had had erased
[46:41] all the past all the the old things
[46:46] now all things are become new
[46:50] sorry if i seem to be screaming i'm a
[46:52] little excited about this
[46:57] i like that script that keep coming to
[46:59] my spirit no weapon
[47:02] form against thee shall prosper
[47:07] let me say that again and let me say it
[47:10] like this
[47:11] no weapon form against
[47:15] you see it must be
[47:19] a present tense understanding that you
[47:24] have to understand that
[47:27] nothing he didn't say it won't come but
[47:29] it won't prosper
[47:33] sickness comes but it won't prosper
[47:38] come on somebody rough times come
[47:42] but it won't prosper
[47:46] trials come but they will prosper
[47:50] why because you got the victory
[47:56] greater is he that is in you
[48:00] come on somebody
[48:05] stop looking at the preacher all the
[48:07] time but
[48:08] greater is god that is in
[48:12] you see
[48:15] it must be a personalized
[48:18] experience that you know who is in you
[48:22] come on somebody and when you know
[48:25] he is there you don't worry about it
[48:29] you're not scared come on you're not
[48:32] trembling you're not fearing why
[48:36] because i know who i
[48:39] believe oh my
[48:43] god oh the servant i'm saying
[48:46] he said when the church realized
[48:51] who she is
[48:55] when come on somebody this is not a
[48:57] group thing church
[48:59] when you catch a revelation
[49:03] when the holy ghost reveals
[49:07] himself to you
[49:10] and you know and you know that he's
[49:13] there
[49:14] see that's why you got to know that god
[49:17] is there
[49:19] don't be guessing don't be thinking
[49:22] you got to know
[49:27] oh my
[49:34] but the battle is not yours
[49:40] i'm looking to that day
[49:44] when the church can rise up in
[49:48] faith and understand
[49:52] no matter what comes no matter what goes
[49:57] it can't touch you
[50:01] why because i'll be the best there are
[50:04] angels
[50:07] angels all around here
[50:10] what did the angel come to do
[50:13] it's come to fortify you
[50:17] oh my one time there was he was a large
[50:22] uh servant of god that we're going to
[50:24] battle
[50:26] and not be able to get hazel and they
[50:30] were just them too when
[50:32] this had that was outnumbered
[50:36] and many god told them saying sir
[50:40] look at all the them that is against us
[50:44] man of god said lord open up his eyes
[50:49] i pray the night that god will open up
[50:52] our spiritual eyes
[50:55] give us a revelation god that what we
[50:59] are talking about
[51:00] is not some prehistoric thing but
[51:03] this is reality it becomes more real to
[51:08] me sister brother
[51:09] i'm understanding that if god be
[51:12] for you then who can touch you
[51:17] i say if god be for you
[51:20] who are what conduct you
[51:24] i see who can lay anything to god elect
[51:29] it's god that justifies
[51:36] if a god before us
[51:40] who or what
[51:43] though it come every time those spirits
[51:47] came
[51:48] especially during the seals when
[51:52] those powers began to rise up
[51:55] to 8 god always had something to combat
[51:58] it
[52:00] because he knew what the people needed
[52:04] at that hour
[52:06] church god knows what we
[52:09] need in this hour
[52:13] that's why you have best understand what
[52:18] has been
[52:18] given to you
[52:22] we are not defeated that's that song
[52:27] we got the power come on in the name of
[52:30] jesus
[52:32] don't hell assail us and though
[52:35] the forces of the enemy press against up
[52:39] but god has given us a weapon
[52:42] and the servant of god said the word can
[52:45] defeat
[52:46] the devil any place anywhere
[52:49] at any time
[52:52] but you got to use it what good is you
[52:56] having something
[52:58] in your possession and you don't use it
[53:02] what good is you having a lot of money
[53:04] you don't spend none
[53:07] then why do you have it see
[53:10] god gave us something
[53:14] he just didn't give us just a message to
[53:16] say what he's saying
[53:19] but this message must come alive
[53:23] it must come a manifestation
[53:26] of god in your life
[53:30] see the message the message well what is
[53:32] the message
[53:33] is christ revealing himself in you
[53:37] the hope of glory
[53:42] oh yes sir i'm telling you something i'm
[53:45] enjoying my
[53:47] trip i'm enjoying the things that god
[53:51] has given to me i'm seeing a glimpse
[53:55] you know what the devil been hiding from
[53:57] us see
[53:58] and long he keep you blind and you can't
[54:02] see what god given you and you just
[54:05] stumbling around and stumbling around
[54:07] or the devil having a pity party on you
[54:10] but when you
[54:11] catch a true revelation
[54:14] that no matter what come against you
[54:18] let me just say that again no matter
[54:21] what
[54:21] come against you
[54:25] you got the victory you got the victory
[54:28] over it
[54:30] it don't contain you you contain
[54:33] it why because the power
[54:36] of the god down in your hearts
[54:44] let me tell you something it's
[54:47] getting greater and what god is trying
[54:51] to do
[54:52] i said what he is doing through his the
[54:55] revealing of his word
[54:57] he's getting a people prepared
[55:04] and these people let me go back to
[55:07] deuteronomy again
[55:15] oh my i had a another encounter
[55:19] with that old spirit of back
[55:26] and you know these things are trying to
[55:27] come back on you
[55:31] even after you have pronounced you've
[55:32] been healed
[55:34] they'll try to come back
[55:38] but i understood that the god that
[55:41] healed me
[55:42] god don't do passion work
[55:47] when god does something he does it
[55:51] when god saves he saves to the
[55:54] utmost god just didn't brought you out
[55:59] of the world
[56:00] are you to be a good church member no
[56:02] god wants to fortify you in the holy
[56:04] ghost
[56:06] he want to give you power give you
[56:09] authority
[56:10] over your situations
[56:17] but we're being tested time memorials
[56:22] all the word that we've been getting
[56:26] what have we been doing with it
[56:30] there's a season god i understand he
[56:33] began to do
[56:34] things and pour out the word in such a
[56:37] way
[56:38] and then the people you know if they
[56:40] don't really catch a really revelation
[56:42] of it
[56:43] then god began to let testing time
[56:46] come
[56:49] yes you say you believe god and you got
[56:53] the
[56:54] message of the hour now god wants you to
[56:57] put that to work
[57:02] because no good are you having something
[57:04] you don't use
[57:06] it ain't worth nothing
[57:09] but what we got is precious
[57:13] it can blow the devil out of this world
[57:20] when the holy ghost begin to quicken it
[57:26] god is looking for a super church
[57:30] a church that's going to be moving in
[57:35] heavenly places a church that
[57:39] knows what god want done with the word
[57:42] of this house
[57:44] not just to say what he's saying but to
[57:47] do what the word say amen
[57:50] because jesus said that the works that i
[57:52] do
[57:53] he said you are going to do
[57:57] you are going to do in other it's a
[58:01] continuation
[58:03] of what was started in the bible and you
[58:07] are
[58:08] writing another bible your
[58:11] written epistles read of all men that
[58:15] when they see you like you did in the
[58:17] book of acts when
[58:18] when they had went to the upper room and
[58:21] they
[58:22] uh the holy ghost fell and they came out
[58:26] of that
[58:27] upper room staggering like drunk man
[58:31] and those people saw some people that
[58:34] that didn't look right they they they
[58:36] look crazy
[58:38] they say are they drunk
[58:42] and brother third they said no say but
[58:44] this
[58:45] is the new wine and when that took place
[58:49] you noticed in the book of acts they
[58:51] went forth
[58:52] turning the cities upside down
[58:56] they had to come together we got to stop
[58:59] them
[59:00] from preaching in that name don't let
[59:03] them
[59:03] put them in jail you when they got in
[59:06] jail
[59:07] the prayer of the saints got them out of
[59:09] jail
[59:12] see you can't stop what god start
[59:17] i mean god starts something he know how
[59:19] to finish it
[59:21] and god don't need a big group if god
[59:24] can get
[59:25] one person to submit
[59:28] their lives to him and consecrate
[59:31] themselves
[59:33] that one person can be in a visible army
[59:37] oh my lord have mercy
[59:41] let me tell you something we
[59:45] you we are in a visible army
[59:49] but let me tell you something god did
[59:51] not
[59:52] call us to sit down brother come on
[59:55] sister robinson
[59:56] you just sing that's like here sing it
[59:59] get up
[1:00:00] sitting down god can't
[1:00:03] use you god tell all the people for
[1:00:10] nothing there's a purpose god got a
[1:00:14] purpose
[1:00:15] in your life god wants to use you
[1:00:18] god wanted you to be the light of the
[1:00:21] city
[1:00:22] god wants your life to reflect him so
[1:00:25] that when people see you they say dumb
[1:00:28] people been with god
[1:00:32] they know they had something
[1:00:36] sometimes they went places they say even
[1:00:40] a
[1:00:40] shadow of though the disciples healed
[1:00:44] the people
[1:00:46] wow because there was such under the
[1:00:48] influence
[1:00:49] of the holy ghost but see it's a price
[1:00:52] to be paid
[1:00:54] nobody want to pay that kind of price
[1:00:57] we all want the power of god but who is
[1:01:01] willing to pay the price
[1:01:05] we just want to be
[1:01:08] telling messaged know that slogan
[1:01:12] a slogan come on but we need to see
[1:01:16] jesus
[1:01:18] we need to see the same god that was
[1:01:20] moving
[1:01:21] back then moving now come on
[1:01:25] if he ain't moving in your life then
[1:01:27] where is your god
[1:01:31] come on don't talk about elijah that day
[1:01:35] where is the god of elijah
[1:01:38] and if god be god where is all his
[1:01:41] miracles
[1:01:43] where is the deliverance
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:48] lord have mercy
[1:01:52] oh my i know but it's 7 days it might
[1:01:56] not be time yet but
[1:01:57] we might need a trip somewhere
[1:02:03] something i feel like i'm about to
[1:02:06] explode
[1:02:08] because i see the condition
[1:02:13] of the world and mind-setting
[1:02:17] i see the spirit that had done made the
[1:02:21] church
[1:02:21] cold lukewarm
[1:02:27] we are backing up and we need to be
[1:02:29] pressing forward
[1:02:32] come on we didn't have the little time
[1:02:33] of time off
[1:02:36] now it's time to get on fire again
[1:02:39] come on it's time now let's have all
[1:02:41] night prayer again
[1:02:43] come on let's have a revival again
[1:02:47] let's get a stirring in our heart that
[1:02:50] lord
[1:02:51] here i am tonight lord and if i have to
[1:02:54] stay here all
[1:02:55] night lord let me stay
[1:03:00] see any move of god that ever took place
[1:03:04] it was a price
[1:03:08] that the people had to pay
[1:03:11] seymour one man
[1:03:14] five hours every day
[1:03:19] praying and ask god you know what god
[1:03:23] told him
[1:03:24] i want more
[1:03:28] five hours and god told me he wanted
[1:03:31] more how about
[1:03:34] us tonight how many of us want more
[1:03:40] are we satisfied
[1:03:44] i'm not satisfied we never can get
[1:03:47] satisfied
[1:03:49] because god got greater things that he
[1:03:52] wants to do see
[1:03:54] this church is supposed to do exploits
[1:03:59] hallelujah what the holy ghost is
[1:04:03] stirring
[1:04:04] inside of the people that we got to pay
[1:04:06] a price
[1:04:08] to get it
[1:04:12] because god is the god that weighs
[1:04:14] action
[1:04:17] talk i know we ought to do
[1:04:20] you know i'm gonna feel like doing come
[1:04:23] on
[1:04:24] let's go let's silence the day that
[1:04:28] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[1:04:32] city
[1:04:32] don't you see what's going on in our
[1:04:34] city
[1:04:36] don't you see what's going on even in
[1:04:39] the church
[1:04:39] world don't you see all what's even
[1:04:42] going on
[1:04:43] in our families and people around us
[1:04:49] but where are the real
[1:04:52] soldiers oh
[1:04:55] yeah oh where are those were rugged
[1:04:59] soldiers who stood on the front line
[1:05:05] i believe those old sinks laid on that
[1:05:08] model bench
[1:05:09] and they begin to sigh and cry lord my
[1:05:13] child lord lord my child lord
[1:05:16] lord i don't know where they at god but
[1:05:19] lord
[1:05:19] save them
[1:05:24] oh my how can we get comfortable
[1:05:29] how can we get satisfied
[1:05:32] i was telling them you remember i said
[1:05:35] you know coming to church
[1:05:37] uh isn't a duty it ought to be a
[1:05:41] love affair
[1:05:44] because your love for god
[1:05:48] is so real and you understood that
[1:05:51] what he did for you you never can repay
[1:05:54] it but
[1:05:54] the little you can do
[1:05:58] he said love the lord with all thy heart
[1:06:01] with all thy mind love him
[1:06:06] and jesus if you love me you keep my
[1:06:08] commandments
[1:06:11] oh my lord help us tonight
[1:06:15] i don't even know where i was at
[1:06:19] he just said i'm closing
[1:06:25] in at first verse the bottom
[1:06:29] he said be not afraid of them
[1:06:33] don't be afraid because uh they're a
[1:06:36] biggie number
[1:06:38] don't be afraid because you may be the
[1:06:41] only one that really got an
[1:06:42] understanding of what god wants you to
[1:06:45] do
[1:06:47] and the holy ghost move upon you you
[1:06:49] move
[1:06:51] amen don't wait on
[1:06:54] groups
[1:06:57] it's an individual affair
[1:07:01] we want the people to come up
[1:07:04] we want you to come on up
[1:07:08] because god is on the move
[1:07:11] i started this thing hallelujah
[1:07:15] god is on the move but he's on the move
[1:07:18] in simplicity see he's not for
[1:07:22] outward show see but god
[1:07:25] moves supernaturally i just can't get
[1:07:28] over the thing the sherpa god said he
[1:07:30] said
[1:07:30] you know he's it's generally in the
[1:07:32] darkest hours

[1:15:25] world
[1:15:27] praise god and i may
[1:15:30] get to that on sunday the imaginary
[1:15:33] world
[1:15:34] praise god i see some of the children
[1:15:37] they have imaginary friends and they be
[1:15:39] talking
[1:15:40] to the imaginary friends and you say
[1:15:44] i said one word
[1:15:47] they just be talking holy conversation
[1:15:49] imaginary friends
[1:15:51] and um so what these children doing now
[1:15:56] and then they got all kind of i guess
[1:15:59] they got all kind of little cartoons
[1:16:01] some of the imaginary friends and all of
[1:16:03] that
[1:16:04] trying to get them to uh cross over into
[1:16:06] that imaginary world
[1:16:08] and to those communicating with spirits
[1:16:11] and demons
[1:16:13] and so we'll the children are being
[1:16:16] taught through the
[1:16:17] cartoons to go into the demon realm
[1:16:20] so the cast spells and do
[1:16:24] uh all kind of things
[1:16:27] and the little words they used to tell
[1:16:29] us i had a book
[1:16:32] that i let brother ernest hold some
[1:16:34] years ago
[1:16:36] it was a book uh dancing with the demons
[1:16:39] the devil amen i never got it back
[1:16:47] don't never let her preach your book
[1:16:50] because you won't get it back
[1:16:51] they told me a long time ago the old
[1:16:53] preachers don't never let a preacher
[1:16:55] book
[1:16:57] because they'll promise you they're
[1:16:58] going to get it back to you
[1:17:00] and i used to have my books in my office
[1:17:02] you notice i put the preachers back here
[1:17:04] because if i put them in my office all
[1:17:06] my books would be gone
[1:17:08] they said brother simon can i borrow
[1:17:10] this book next thing you know
[1:17:11] preachers i i let a preacher's borrow
[1:17:16] some of the books i got from brother
[1:17:17] mammals he said you know
[1:17:19] y'all gave me no book a lot of
[1:17:22] some books i paid a lot of money for i
[1:17:24] let preachers
[1:17:25] i don't remember that the show
[1:17:31] but by the grace of god you keep
[1:17:33] fighting the good fight of faith saints
[1:17:36] it won't be long and we'll be going home
[1:17:39] i said the devil
[1:17:42] is battling you with all he got but he
[1:17:44] ain't got much
[1:17:46] each and every one of us are going
[1:17:48] through our own personal battle with
[1:17:50] demon powers
[1:17:52] but you got to know each and each and
[1:17:54] every one of us have our own
[1:17:56] individual battle that we got to fight
[1:18:00] the prophet god said the devil got one
[1:18:02] punch for each and every one of us
[1:18:05] and you got to learn amen what that
[1:18:07] punch is all about
[1:18:08] in your life because
[1:18:11] he said he'll allow that devil to punch
[1:18:13] you in that area
[1:18:15] but as soon as you recognize with that
[1:18:17] area which the devil is punching you in
[1:18:20] look like he's just punching you
[1:18:22] punching you're punching he said he got
[1:18:24] a right to do that
[1:18:26] amen so what happens if you know the
[1:18:29] devil
[1:18:29] got a right to punch you in that area
[1:18:31] you must guard that area
[1:18:34] that particular place in your life must
[1:18:36] be guarded
[1:18:38] because if you don't guard that
[1:18:39] particular area the devil will punch you
[1:18:42] out
[1:18:43] amen but if you guard the area
[1:18:46] in which the devil amen comes against
[1:18:49] you
[1:18:50] at the most crucial and most difficult
[1:18:52] times
[1:18:54] you must guard the area amen
[1:18:57] so as i was saying the prince of this
[1:19:00] world
[1:19:01] is cast out because jesus christ
[1:19:04] amen has defeated the devil on every
[1:19:08] point the devil is defeated
[1:19:11] it doesn't matter what he tries to do
[1:19:13] what he attempts to do
[1:19:15] the devil is a defeated foe
[1:19:19] when jesus declared is finished
[1:19:22] then it's finished praise god doesn't
[1:19:25] matter what the devil tried
[1:19:27] it's over with you have the victory by
[1:19:30] faith
[1:19:31] and you have overcome the world amen
[1:19:35] praise god
[1:19:38] the devil will tell you amen
[1:19:42] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[1:19:44] that but don't worry about it

[1:26:09] men in high school there was witnessing
[1:26:11] and everything
[1:26:12] and i would get them and take them
[1:26:14] through georgetown
[1:26:17] and we walked the streets and witnessed
[1:26:19] the folk
[1:26:21] and um
[1:26:24] one was always trying to do the other
