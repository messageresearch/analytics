and Lord we ask you should come down and just move us Lord speak to every need tonight those that are here and those that are watching Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight I ask that you turn to the book of First Kings First Kings chapter 18. it's a very familiar scripture First Kings chapter 18 we're actually starting the 21st verse and it reads when you got to say Amen amen and the reason the logic came unto all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bailed then follow him and the people answer him not a word then said Elijah unto the people I even not only remain a prophet of the Lord but Bale's Prophet are 450 Men Let Them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one Bullock for themselves and cut it in in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your God and I will call on the name of the Lord and the Lord answered by fire and the Lord that answered by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken God bless the reason that's where you may be seated I'm going to read a little bit further down here and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal choose you one Bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your God but put no fire under and they took the bullet which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Bell from morning until noon saying Obel hear us but there was no voice nor any answer and they leaping in upon the altar which was made and it came and was dropped down to the 29th verse and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither a voice nor any answer no any to answer nor any that regarded and Elijah said unto the P unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob and not to whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the Bullock in pieces and laid it on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it a second time and they did it the second time and he said do it a third time and they did it a third time and the water ran round about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has not that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice in the wood in the stones in the dust and licked up the water that was in in the trench and all and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the he is the god the Lord he is the god amen God bless you read another's word amen I read that because tonight I like to speak on a little topic and I entitled it Victory Day Victory Day at this moment in Junction as we read in the story there was two opposing forces they had There Was Elijah and there was the prophets of Baal and they came to this in this call many of times as many people call it they call it the Mount Caramel Showdown because of where it happened but there was something that was taking place and and Elijah said you've you've forgotten what God has done for you you've forgotten where God has brought you from you've forgotten from where you've come from but I want God to show you and give you Victory on this day so it was a Day of Victory it was something that was going to be miraculous see God had to remind them of where they was and what they needed so he brought them to a Day of Victory and so I I looked up the word Victory and they said the overcoming of an enemy it's an achievement of Mastery of success and a stroke in a struggle in the or an Endeavor against odds or difficulties see there this was against odds they put that sacrifice on the altar that Elijah had made and then they put water on it and many people know that if you got anything and you put you got fire and you put water on it it puts out the fire so anything that's wet shouldn't burn but this fire wasn't just regular fire it was Supernatural fire see it was a there was victory in this fire there was a victory so powerful that the water couldn't destroy it the stones couldn't destroy it what was in the trenches couldn't destroy it see that fire could take care of everything it could consume everything see that's the victory that God wants to give he gives you victory that nothing can stand against it nothing that comes against you can stand against it see that's how powerful the victory that God's has and see it had to come to a moment on a day see that's why I'm tired of Victory Day because it happened at a specific time in a specific place and I want to ask the question when did you get your victory when did you get your Victory and you say Victory maybe you say well it might not happen like did happen for Elijah but you mean victory over what and I asked the question when did you get your victory over your anger when did you get your victory over over your pride when did you get your victory over your fear when did you get victory over lying over stealing over cheating when did you get your Victory when did you get victory over self-righteousness or your attitude see today can be your day of Victory today could be the moment in time when you say I can walk away today was my day of Victory this was my moment where I came to my Showdown these two opposing forces came together and I said and I got my victory see each there are many stories and examples in the Bible that we can look back to and see there were specific moments when they got Victory you look at the story of Moses he one day he he got taken out of Egypt because he had done wrong and he got in the backside of the Wilderness but that wasn't where he was meant to stay that wasn't when he was going to get victory that wasn't when God was going to fulfill his promise to his children of Israel that he was going to bring them out of Egypt he was going to deliver them from captivity but he there came a moment on the day where after the he went back to Egypt he got back in his right position he got back in his right place God has showed him see Moses got victory in the wilderness when God came down in the burning bush where the Bush was not consumed he came to his victory day but that wasn't the children of Israel's Victory Day it was different see each one has got to be your own individual Day of Victory you can't lean on someone else you got to have your own experience you got to have your own time when you got a loan you got along with God and God has given you the victory and you can point back to that time and say this was when that was my day of victory that was the day I overcame that was the day I put all these things behind me and I died out and God took control it was that day that day of Victory see Moses had his in the wilderness but he had to go back and do what God told them and he said I can't speak but God said I don't need you to speak I do all of the I'll do all of that he went back and Pharaoh heart was hardened and it was hardened against Moses and the children of Israel but God worked all that out and one day they was delivered out of Egypt and they got to the Red Sea they had the mountain on one side and the sea in front of them and Pharaoh behind them and something else so they couldn't go back and they couldn't go to the size and Moses went to God and he said God what can what shall I do you didn't bring him this far to leave them see there was a victory that was about to happen and he said he said you speak don't you speak and you and Moses lifted up his hands and the Sea parted see that was the Day of Victory and they walked across that Red Sea on dragging around now everybody know that if you've been in water and you take all the water away you're still damn but they said it was dry ground because that was their Day of Victory and God was showing them if I can do this what else can I do if I can do this everything that I promise you is on the way everything that I promise you that promised land that flowed with milk and honey is on the way if I can do this what else can I do see there's a Day of Victory that you got to come to and you got to see that if God did this he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God and he said I change not because there was a Day of Victory and they came and they crossed the Red Sea and when they got Crossing Pharaoh chased them and God swallowed up the enemy he swallowed them up in the water the enemy was utterly destroyed just like the sacrifice it was utterly destroyed because when God does something he doesn't do it halfway when God does something he doesn't say I'm going to do part of it and lead the rest to you for you to pick figure out he said I already worked it out because there was their Day of Victory and he took that day and they got crossed that Red Sea and you know what they did there's a sound there's a sound once you get Victory you don't just sit still and you you they started thanking God they started praising God they started playing instruments they started singing songs because there was a shout with the victory there was a dance with their Victory it wasn't just the moment that carried on and they and they got the they realized that I got the victory there were some actions that had to follow when they got to Victory there were some things that had to happen after they got the victory because they realized we only got to Victory because of the Lord was with us we only got the victory because he was our strength we only got the victory because he came by and he did exactly what he said he would do see there was their Day of Victory and they can look back and see when he brought me through I praise the Lord then why can't I praise him now so he went and brought me through the Red Sea he can take me over Jordan because Jordan's not bigger than the Red Sea see he got to that point in their Day of Victory and one day Joshua they got to the red the Jordan ribbon it was overflowing it was flowing they said how we gonna get crossed who crosses the river the enemy was looking from the opposite Bank maybe and they was looking and saying who crossed the river when it's flooded who crosses a river when it's flooded ain't no way they're gonna cross that and Joshua walked up to it because he was given the word and the waters parted again he said if God brought us through the rest she Jordan ain't no match for him and they walked crossing the enemies got scared because they knew what was coming they might not have known to the fullness but they say our day our Day of Defeat is coming see there's two things that happens when when the Day of Victory happened there's a Day of Defeat there's a Day of Defeat for the enemy so you don't have to worry about that because you just worry about your Victory you just worry about the Lord taking you on higher and further on into your Victory and maybe you don't understand the extent of it but it is until you die out it is until you sacrificed it is until you come and you said when how when have when did I get my victory and if you haven't got your Victory what's holding you back if you haven't obtained your Victory what's holding you back what's stopping you from getting your Victory is it people is it friends is it status is it your dreams is it your things that you think that you're going to achieve in life is it maybe your the people that you're around what is holding you back from getting your victory see there was people that came to job when Cho was there and he was struggling he would look like he was down and out and his friends came to him and said and why don't you just give up on God there ain't nothing else you can do and his wife came to him and she said you might as well curse your God and die but one day job kept he kept holding on he said naked I came into this world and naked I shall return but that didn't cause him to give up on God and one day after the trials was over he had a Day of Victory he had a day where he could shout and he could sing about how much more God did than what he already had he replaced it and replenished it double for what he already had see job had a Day of Victory Dayton job had a day where he can look back and say what God has brought me through he can continue to carry me through see job had that experience and there was more of the Hebrew boys they had victory over the fire they have victory over a furnace that killed the ones that threw them in it killed the ones but it didn't harm them and when they got out they didn't even smell like smoke now if you've been around anything that has ever burned you ever been barbecuing on the grill and you stand next to the smoke you don't have to stand there alone to smell like smoke this fire was so hot it killed people when they got near the fire so you know the smoke was all over the place now how in the world do you not smell like smoke but it was their Day of Victory God was going to show them that I can do exceedingly abundantly more than you can ask a thing they said even they told they told the king that even if we die we still won't doubt the god that we serve that has no bearing if we die in the fire it has no bearing on the faith that we have in our god it has no bearing on how much we believe in our god it has no bearing that we will never doubt them because our Day of Victory is today whether we whether we live or whether we die it was still their Day of Victory it was still the day that they was going to overcome because God was with him God was with him and he was going to overcome it and see Daniel had victory over the Lions he got thrown into the lion's den and but the Lions did not touch him it was the God has shut them out to the Lions from attacking his servants see Daniel had a Day of Victory and then David had days multiple days of Victory they even had victory over the lion he had victory over the bear and then he had victory over Goliath sometimes God got to give you Victory after Victory after Victory to get you to where you need to be event David couldn't be a ruler without having victory over the lion David couldn't be a ruler without having victory over the bear David couldn't lead a nation without having victory over Goliath David couldn't have a victory until he had laid down and in himself and overcame his pride and said that I will let Saul live the many times he had to take him out even though it was his right to be king he said touch not God's anointed and see David had many a times where he had to overcome and it in this life that you live you have many moments where you got to overcome you got to have them days of Victory days and in battles that you're gonna face with and that's a NASA Victory and that's a mystery and many times we call them testimonies what is a life live if you don't have a testimony what is a life living you you have don't can't point back and say God did this and God did this and God did this and God did this and because he did all that I can believe him for this and because he did this and this I can believe him for this because he's the same God yesterday today and forever see he's the god that gives Victory he's the one that gives you overcoming power he's the one that gives you the power that you can rise above it all now you can take wings and you're gonna fly over the storm you can fly over and you can say Lord I I don't know what you're doing but I know you're keeping me I know you're holding me up here so that the storms don't bother me I know that you're keeping me and you continue to watching over me Lord and you're stopping me from going ways that I shouldn't go but that's after you've had victory over yourself that's after you've died out and you've given God all you've given him everything that he can have the victory not your Victory but his victory see he'll lead you through the storms he'll lead you through the through the past as you should go he'll take you through places that you never thought you would be and he'll take you on a on a path that you thought this was not my way but see that's the key it wasn't your way it was his way see he had given you the victory to overcome what was going to be in your way see it was a it was a Day of Victory see Jesus came he came to he came to the Garden of Gethsemane he got Victory because he got that he said Lord if this cup can't pass he said Lord not my will but thy will be none see Jesus had gotten a victory and because he got the victory we could get to Victory because he laid down his life he laid it down to save us he saw us in the back of his mind and he said I'm going to lay down my life so that they can get Victory I'm going to lay down my life so they can look up at the cross and at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart was rolled away and it was there by faith I received my sight and now I'm happy all the day see that at that cross there was Victory see you know and if you read through the scripture many times you didn't see Victory without a sacrifice you didn't see Victory without a sacrifice before the before the many times the the Kings would go to battle they would say let's go consult the Lord let's offer up a sacrifice let's offer up a sacrifice to God to see what he wants us to do and everything it had to be by a blood sacrifice it couldn't just be by any sacrifice had to be the right sacrifice and see Jesus was the right sacrifice for you and I he understood that there was no nothing else that could take the place of him dying for us he understood and all and by him dying for us he'll he overcame and he had the victory over everything that could come over every sickness disease and over every demon power that was stand in the way of his people he overcame it in that moment at Calvary brother random said he said Godless disappointments happen to show victory he said God lets disappointments happens to show Victory see you'd only see that these things that seem to be burning you and upsetting you they are trials the things that are bothering you and upsetting you they are trials and see God lets those things happen so that he can gain victory said these things are these things they are things to stand still focus on the word of God and speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to do just and speak the word and just walk forward see when God gives you Victory you can just walk forward when God gives you Victory you might not know how you might not know why but God is all you got to do is walk forward I was going to read the scripture there was lepers that was sitting on the gates outside of Samaria and Samaria was surrounded by an army and there was no food going in and out and the people in the city were starving and these leopards because they couldn't be in the city because of their disease one day they got up and they consulted within themselves and they said you know if we go in the city city we gonna die and we go and we might as well try our chances with this Army we might as well try our chances because either way we're going to die so they went to the Army but they didn't know that God had already worked in the background God had sent a sound that the Army had fled because they thought that they they had consulted other armies and brought them in to take them out so they had fled but the lepers didn't know that so they walked by faith they took the faith that God had given them and they said we if we die we already was going to die one way or another and they got down there and they realized oh this tent is empty and they see oh there's some food and they got to eat and then they went to the next one they said this one empty hey go down there and check that one and it went down a little bit further and they checked that one and they checked us they said oh and then they got the oh they started celebrating because God had given them the victory but they started celebrating and then they said hold on wait a minute this Victory ain't good enough if we don't tell somebody we can have Victory all by ourselves but we need to share this Victory with others we need to go back and tell somebody of what God has done we need to go back and share so that they can celebrate in our Victory they can celebrate in what God has done they can celebrate with us because of how Mighty God has been and given us our Day of Victory it's not just my day but it's all our days of Victory that's that's what they wanted and they ran back and they told them they said come come come because God has done a mighty work and of course something was skeptical there were some that may be doubted but after they got going and one came back and they said no it's true no it's true how many times do you have to hear somebody say it's true before you believe before you accept it maybe this is my time for victory maybe I can accept Victory because if God Did It for this one and he did it for that one and he did it for this one why can't he do it for me he's the same God he said I'm God and I never change see there was a Day of Victory in those leopards they got they they decided to one day take take the word and move forward they decided to with that thought that came to them they decided to move on that thought they decided to go to that camp and say if we die but they didn't know God had done the word and sometimes that's how easy Victory is is to trust God and just move forward is to trust God and take him at his word and say God you're the god that delivers God you're the god that heals God you're the god that saves Lord I can believe that you will save Lord I can believe that you will deliver Lord I can believe that you will heal because you said it in your word I can believe for my Day of Victory and see even though I don't see Victory happening today I know that this Victory is is on the way I know that this Victory is on the way I can I can stand up I can shout today I can lift my hand and I can say today is my day of Victory I can turn to my neighbor and I can say today I got the victory today I can walk forward in faith and believe in that today was my day of Victory because God said it in his word see Paul had to come to his Crossroads he had to get on the road and and the Lord had to Blind him and said Paul Paul while persecuted thou me see Paul had to die to himself to get his victory to the point he died so much that he said all that I attained I counted as lost and Paul was a scholar The Scholar may be one of the brightest minds of his time he wrote half of the New Testament he was one of the brightest men but he had to die to himself he had to die and give himself completely over to gain Victory and Paul said all that I counted as laws and Paul said here in Philippians he said not as though I have already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Paul came to the point that he wanted Victory he won the victory over everything that that he had done everything that had happened in his life he won a victory and God came down and gave him his Day of Victory he can point back to the time I said I used to be like this but this is what God has made me he could point back to the time and he said I used to do this thing but this is what God has done for me he had a testimony he had his days of Victories and he turned around and he could give his testimony to others and say this is where God has brought me from because of his days of victory now I asked when did you get your victory when did you when did you get your victory over what you were struggling with over what you may may have had in your life because these moments and these these battles will come but it takes something greater to overcome it takes something greater than you have inside of you it takes something greater on some battles only can be won by the Lord being in You by the Lord overcoming those battles for you so I asked when did you get your victory [Applause] they may appreciate the word amen she had a lot of hand clap of phrase [Applause] what a word we heard tonight amen I was thinking about it Lord give me a message I entitled a witness it says you got to be a witness of what the Lord is doing and I just thought that was good tonight how he was saying what what's good as a victory if you ain't gonna tell nobody God do those things for you because he wants you to be a witness I thought about so many things he was saying Victory Day I was in my mind going about Moses before he went there and then he went there standing on the Red Sea and the Lord told him after this day the enemy that fight against you they won't see him no more again at this this Victory Day that's the terminology he used after this day I thought about David before he went there David how he he told Goliath he says you know I'm gonna take your head off and I'm gonna feed it to the files I mean the carcass body file's gonna eat it he said in this day he said all the Earth gonna know there's a God in Israel I thought about it it's a victory day it come a point and I thought about it I said so many times in my Christian Journey I carried things and I wrestle with things but you get tired sometimes and that's why I always found my way right out here to the altar on my knees and I said I ain't carrying it no more after this day when I get up I ain't carrying that no more situation can get worse don't change nothing but after this day it ain't my fight I'm not fighting it no more and that that becomes your Victory because you get down like Jacob did you wrestle you say I've been carrying it and I'm tired I'm tired of carrying it I'm tired of having sleepless nights I'm tired of being worn out I'm tired and God you said to cast all my cares upon you because you care for me you said to take my yoke upon you and learn of me because my yoke is easy right and my burden is light so you come to that place those times and sometimes you come to them a little later than you should have you carry it a little longer than you should have but you get tired when you get tired you said Lord I don't care no more after this day I ain't I'm going on in God I ain't carrying it no more but I thought about that I said what a word tonight that we heard I believe it was still a small voice you know as like I said as the Lord I was I was going to minister on and I still probably with the Lord's will on being a witness because all week long I don't know about y'all but all week long I've been testifying at work I've been telling somebody about the goodness of Jesus all week long I know this morning God forgive us we're supposed to be out there working probably about an hour and a half we was going over scriptures talking about the goodness of Jesus one of the guys at work the other night because they had a problem right after the Bible study as soon as I walk out the door they call me we need you to come out here because the ball are down so I went out there and uh Lord will Lord blessed in 10 minutes we had it back on so the next day everybody looking at you as a hero man you what'd you do and I said you know what I said let me tell y'all like this I says if it ain't God that show me these things I wouldn't know it I said I said if I tell you I did this whatever like that I said God might take everything from me right now I says I can't tell you nothing without saying how good God is to him I said everybody looking at this I said but don't you know God be showing me all these things God that be God doing that I started and from there it turned into a testimony service I started telling them about the goodness of God and I said you know we started talking about health and sicknesses and I said you know if you've got health or good health you you a blessed individual but you take it for granted but let the Lord take a little bit of that away you'll understand how good that Health was or how good God was you woke up in the morning and you had good lungs I always say that you woke up in the morning you had legs I started talking my I said you know those are the things that you learn to praise God for you know we out there on the floor post to be working now talking about the goodness of Jesus one guy we call them we call him OG he says Ernest he he's uh almost 70 years old still working he said Earnest he said let me tell you something he said you see that one of these trial is he says about 30 years ago ran out and I wasn't watching it and ran and hit my leg he said it broke my leg in like three places he named the bones that it broke and he said that so I was out of work for a little while not sitting in the house he said I was so frustrated he said enough I got in the car he says I'm gonna go in the car and go to the store he said I got my crutch and I was pushing that driving with the crutch going to the store and he says I was miserable he says and I was so mad because I couldn't work and all this other stuff because my leg was messed up he says but no soon as I got to the to the store he said this guy got out the car he had but one leg and he says I looked at that he said I'm glad for this broken leg you know but he didn't start telling me about how his mama died when he was when she was 39 and it was eight of those children and how good all of his siblings still living and how God been keeping them and blessing them I tell you we started having testimony service but I said you know what I said God is good we got to tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus all that he did for us and brought us from a mighty long way like brother Kayla was saying tonight a victory what good is a victory you ain't gonna tell somebody about it you got to tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus I was talking to them boys this morning at work and just talking I said you know through all the the the stuff you had to deal with with racism and all this other things had to deal with in in certain departments at work and all the I said but God give me favor all the time I said God is so good I said don't you know God he's he set up whoever he won't he tear down whoever he wants because he's God and he don't got no respect to persons I said so the thing is I recognize the place that I am in the place in the mind that I am in life I recognize that everything I have belongs to God and I can't tell you nothing people don't believe in God and all these things I says but I I wish you know you would believe I was telling the um testimony about how you know y'all forgive me but I was telling testimony at work but we worked all night one time and I said I'm going to church they say Ernest how you doing you I don't know how you do it and I start testifying about where God brought me from and how I was low and how I started testifying how I was in bad shape and I prayed and I said God if you help me get out of this I'll do the best I can to serve you and I said how little by little God begin to bless me I talked about them about addictions that I had I talked to them about when I ain't had money talk to them about him through sicknesses and all that God has been good to me and I says that the little thing that you think about that's a lot because you you press your with that ain't nothing compared to the blessings that God gave you and as I was talking like that big Gene we call them at work a big Gene he said Earnest you almost convinced me to go to church in the morning and I thought about Paul and Kingdom gripper and I began to tell them I says I wish that I wouldn't convince you but you get on and come on put your clothes on come on to church in the morning I said because I don't even know your story but I know God been good to you you about 50 years old I know you had some storms and some things in your life I don't even know your story but you here right now walking talking breathing all that God been good to you boy can I say it like that he been good to you you know you got to testify to tell somebody about the goodness of God you know but you know what happens don't wait to to till you don't have right you say I should have told somebody how good God was don't wait I don't know you got to brag on Jesus you got to let you know people brag on themselves and they ain't nothing but dirt they ain't nobody and they bragging on I did this I did look what it ain't nothing they couldn't they informed themselves God made them didn't he God Made You You bragging doing all that what are you nothing if it ain't for God touch you wake you up if it ain't for God angels of around your car seeing cars flipped over if it ain't for God what are you nothing without me you can't do what he said nothing can you but God is so good you know I was telling them about the testimony how my stomach was bothering me bad one time and I come to the church and and I don't know if y'all remember but I was bent over and couldn't hardly walk and we Russ Simmons called me up everybody stood around to pray for me and Brother Sam was praying but brother Gordon he said he said brother Gordon touch your brother Ernest hey lay your hands on his stomach and know soon as brother Gordon laid his hands on my stomach the pain left just like that and it ain't never came back I said don't you know God and that's why that's why I said I'm a witness you could talk about say what you want I'm a witness God is still a Healer I'm a witness that Miracles is still real I'm a witness I'm a witness that is blood ain't never lost its power I'm a witness that he still saves he still heals he still delivers I'm a witness and I'm gonna testify about the goodness of Jesus he might ain't did it for you but for me I know what he did for me and I'm gonna tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus come on you know when you start talking about God the presence just comes at working you know you see them boys tears come in their eyes and all that when you start talking about the goodness of Jesus right because what it is you thankful of what God has done for you right he gave you the victory didn't he not to just be walking shame or whatever you got to tell somebody you got to tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus you can't be ashamed of him how you know what he did for you they stripped all his clothes off of him didn't they they will spit on him pull hair out of his face mock them slapped them upside the head didn't they give him a cross to carry hung him put nails in his hand his feet hanging out there I know like they say on the pictures they got clothes on him but he was naked hanging Between Heaven and Earth right blood coming down his face he did it all because he know that if he didn't go that distance you and I wouldn't have rights to the Tree of Life you and I wouldn't have access to get back to that place in God so he wasn't ashamed to go that distance for you and I wasn't he did it God God is so good so are you ashamed of him tonight Are you ashamed of God he wasn't ashamed of you I don't know about you but I thank God like I said for the word tonight there's so many things especially when he start going into that area about you got to tell somebody you know because because you got to be a witness you know God gives
