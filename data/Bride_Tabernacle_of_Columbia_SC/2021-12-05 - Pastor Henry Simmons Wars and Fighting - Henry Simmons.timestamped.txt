[34:52] i'll read the first you read the next
[34:54] and we'll go through the 10th verse read
[34:56] the 10th verse together
[35:01] from whence cometh walls and fighting
[35:04] among you
[35:06] come they not hints
[35:09] even of your lusts
[35:12] the war in your members too
[35:27] and receive not because you act some
[35:29] miss
[35:30] that you may consume it upon your lust
[35:34] for
[35:47] do you think that the scripture says in
[35:49] vain the spirit that dwelt in us lusts
[35:54] to envy
[35:56] 6.
[36:04] submit yourselves therefore to god
[36:06] resist the devil and he would flee from
[36:10] you eight
[36:19] be afflicted and moan
[36:22] and weak
[36:23] let your laughter be turned in the
[36:25] morning and your joy to heavenness
[36:28] together
[36:29] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[36:31] lord and he shall lift you up may god
[36:34] bless you in his word you may be seated
[36:37] praise god
[36:41] they said there's a battle between
[36:43] humility and pride
[36:45] praise god
[36:47] god resists the proud but he gives grace
[36:50] to the humble
[36:52] so there's always a battle where he met
[36:54] the flesh don't have no humility in it
[36:56] it don't
[36:58] they don't desire humility and to be
[37:00] humble
[37:02] amen
[37:04] but in order to be humble you must
[37:07] you must
[37:08] resist the devil amen
[37:12] and sometimes we're looking for an
[37:13] outside devil but
[37:16] our greatest enemy adversary is self
[37:21] amen so we must look at the walls and
[37:24] fighting where they come from
[37:26] what causes the walls and fighting
[37:30] now i i want you to be mindful this
[37:32] morning that a lot of times we think
[37:35] that
[37:36] amen he says now here
[37:38] he said from whence cometh
[37:41] walls and fighting
[37:43] we want to talk about wars where did it
[37:45] come from for which commented james had
[37:47] to deal with it i i want you to know
[37:50] that he was not talking to
[37:53] the world
[37:54] but he was talking to the church
[37:57] and he met in the jews at that time they
[38:00] had a lot of schisms and isms in the
[38:02] body
[38:04] and so they had internal fighting
[38:08] and he said but where did it come from i
[38:10] want you to understand for where it
[38:13] comes from whence cometh wars and
[38:15] fighting among you
[38:17] amen
[38:18] see because a lot of times
[38:20] uh people don't understand why
[38:24] they're warned and why they are fighting
[38:27] you know
[38:29] he says
[38:30] come they not hints
[38:33] even of your what
[38:37] the first verse is james 4 1.
[38:40] he says
[38:42] from
[38:43] whence cometh wars and fighting among
[38:45] you coming they not
[38:48] hints
[38:49] even of your what
[38:55] not somebody else's now
[38:58] he said who's
[39:00] yo lust
[39:02] you see what i'm saying now we don't
[39:04] want to put it on an exterior somebody
[39:06] else he said it comes among you but
[39:10] where did it come from
[39:13] are you are you with me
[39:16] god is not the author of confusion but
[39:19] of what
[39:21] peace god says my peace i what
[39:25] now but where did walls and fighting
[39:28] come
[39:29] among you
[39:31] you know i i
[39:33] i was
[39:34] saying ernest you know he said you're
[39:36] going to consumption this morning and i
[39:38] says
[39:40] it's a possibility that i said let me
[39:41] pray on it and everything i prayed for
[39:44] is i said i got to come here because i
[39:46] got to speak to the church
[39:48] and uh
[39:50] it's it's a matter of
[39:52] i believe that it's an urgency that the
[39:54] church grow up fast
[39:57] and growing up that means we come to
[40:00] maturity
[40:02] he says when i was a child i was
[40:06] i speak as a child i understood as a
[40:08] child
[40:09] but when i became a
[40:11] when i became a man i put away what
[40:14] i put away childish things isn't that
[40:16] right
[40:17] see it's time to grow up and and the
[40:20] only way we're going to grow up
[40:22] amen into the statue of a perfect man is
[40:25] that we be no longer babes
[40:29] drinking milk we gotta start eating meat
[40:35] amen and you got to have your senses
[40:37] exercised
[40:39] and being able to return good and evil
[40:43] are you with me
[40:45] so there must be a spirit of discernment
[40:47] and that spirit of discernment shows you
[40:49] who your real enemy is
[40:52] are you with me
[40:53] because if you can't discern the devil
[40:56] and how he works
[40:58] are you with me
[40:59] then you would be looking at friendly
[41:01] fire as i said another week
[41:04] friendly fire a lot of folk get killed
[41:07] from their own people that's on their
[41:09] side and they call it friendly fire
[41:12] jesus said to judas friend
[41:15] betrayed thou me what the what
[41:18] kiss
[41:19] he said uh it was a men of my own
[41:22] company my own acquaintance those are
[41:25] the ones
[41:26] you know
[41:28] the foes of my own house
[41:31] see jesus amen was facing what those
[41:34] that he came to save was the one that
[41:37] thought he was against them so they
[41:39] sought to kill him
[41:42] and jesus said well i seek you to kill
[41:44] me he they said we know he said well you
[41:46] got a devil ain't nobody trying to kill
[41:48] you
[41:50] are you with me
[41:52] they said you know the jews amen did not
[41:56] know they meant the spirit that was
[41:58] operating in their lives they couldn't
[42:01] understand it that jesus was even peter
[42:03] at one time he said a master don't all
[42:06] deny you i would never do it and jesus
[42:09] said to peter get me behind me
[42:12] satan amen why because the devil was so
[42:16] crafty that he could slip in and you be
[42:18] unconscious unaware
[42:21] amen
[42:22] so paul even addressed the galatians he
[42:24] said he said i i'm marvel that you're so
[42:28] soon removed from him that i call you
[42:30] until another gospel
[42:32] are you are you with me he said which is
[42:35] not another
[42:37] he said but don't we on an angel come
[42:39] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[42:41] than that which we preach he said let
[42:44] let him be a curse ain't that right
[42:47] see what happens amen sometimes we
[42:50] forgot
[42:53] we forget and we get amnesia quickly
[42:57] amen
[42:58] and and sometimes uh we're looking at
[43:01] the wrong
[43:03] adversary
[43:06] and then if we think that
[43:08] uh
[43:09] wars and fighting come from within
[43:12] but it comes from a spirit
[43:16] and you know
[43:18] the bible said take here at least you'll
[43:20] be consumed one of another
[43:22] are you whooping
[43:24] the devil can sit on the outside and
[43:26] just sit looking in because he's caused
[43:29] all the trouble then he let you
[43:32] are you with me
[43:34] the devil caused all the trouble and
[43:37] then he just set back
[43:39] and like he ain't done nothing
[43:42] he doesn't cause all the trouble amen
[43:44] and then all of a sudden people are uh
[43:46] focusing their attention on one another
[43:49] instead of on the devil that calls it
[43:50] all
[43:53] it
[43:54] a lot of times a misunderstanding amen
[43:57] can cause a lot of division a lot of
[43:59] trouble just some misunderstanding
[44:02] are you with me
[44:04] the devil will cause you to be thrown
[44:07] off in just a minute it'll corrupt your
[44:10] spirit it'll cause amen
[44:13] from whence com it'll cause marriages to
[44:16] break up
[44:17] homes should be destroyed everything why
[44:20] a misunderstanding
[44:24] instead of uh you know
[44:26] trying to uh
[44:27] uh stay amen together we'll divide
[44:31] ourselves
[44:33] and the devil know if he can get you to
[44:35] divide yourself
[44:37] amen then he can conquer you
[44:41] amen he can conquer the family he can
[44:43] conquer the home if he gets the husband
[44:45] and wife divided then he conquers the
[44:48] children are you with me the devil seek
[44:51] to kill to steal and what
[44:54] destroy but he wants you to divide you
[44:56] he wants you to be up against one
[44:59] another amen
[45:01] and then we try to prove who's right and
[45:03] who's wrong
[45:05] it's
[45:05] what when we come to maturity it's not
[45:07] who's right and who's wrong
[45:10] we don't want to even bother with that
[45:12] we're talking about a church coming into
[45:14] maturity amen because we got to come
[45:16] into maturity to get out of here
[45:19] amen we got to grow up to get out of
[45:21] here and and growing up amen we're
[45:24] talking about let's go to first
[45:26] corinthians 13 for a moment
[45:30] coming into that statue of a perfect man
[45:32] and coming in to perfect love is
[45:35] something that we must strive to do
[45:38] amen in in striving for that um
[45:43] perfect love status
[45:45] it's some things that we got to forget
[45:48] those things which are behind us
[45:51] are you with me
[45:52] we got to deal with amen
[45:55] from whence coming walls and fighting
[45:57] among you
[45:59] it don't come from without
[46:02] the lust that was in our members
[46:06] it's things that inside of us that god
[46:09] wants to take out of us
[46:11] you know i was telling brother nate and
[46:13] he was telling me about the situation i
[46:15] said brother nathan you know we almost
[46:17] 70 years old stuff that used to bother
[46:20] us 20 years 30 years ago don't bother us
[46:22] now
[46:25] are you with me
[46:27] how many of you know the stuff that
[46:28] bothered you in first grade when you
[46:30] getting in junior high school you know
[46:33] it don't even bother you
[46:35] are you with me that first great stuff
[46:38] and elementary stuff you get on up
[46:41] junior high you said i'm past that
[46:44] you listening to the first and second
[46:45] graders talk about their little uh
[46:47] little things that they're going through
[46:48] you look at them and kind of smile well
[46:51] you don't become a teenager
[46:55] and you look at a teenager when you
[46:57] become a young adult
[46:58] and this little stuff they're going
[47:00] through
[47:01] as a teenager you look at them
[47:05] the parents look at the teenagers and
[47:07] stuff they get trying to get over and uh
[47:10] you know parents don't understand this
[47:12] and they don't know this and you know
[47:14] and the parents just look at them like
[47:16] you've never been a teenager
[47:18] they think you've never been a teenager
[47:21] and then
[47:22] it gets on
[47:23] up to a place where your grandparents
[47:25] your grandparents and
[47:28] and your children trying to rare their
[47:30] children and stuff like that and
[47:31] grandparents looked at him and said
[47:35] you know they already been that way and
[47:37] they know certain things there's a
[47:39] certain level of maturity and i'm saying
[47:42] the
[47:43] somebody trying to you know learn uh uh
[47:47] how to add and subtract and you're up
[47:49] there in algebra and you're going on in
[47:52] trigonometry and all of that stuff and
[47:55] they said they
[47:56] have trouble with you know four
[47:59] and four
[48:01] ah and they're happy
[48:03] it's eight
[48:07] dealing with
[48:08] algebra trigonometry
[48:11] geometry and they happen because they
[48:14] just find out that two plus two is four
[48:17] and all of that and adding subtraction
[48:19] but you don't pass all of that and in
[48:21] the spirit realm amen we got to get to a
[48:24] place that
[48:25] amen we're no longer in elementary
[48:28] school we're no longer in junior high
[48:30] school and we're no longer in high
[48:32] school but we going on up amen
[48:35] and we've graduated from college now
[48:40] and we you should we're supposed to know
[48:41] how to navigate and how to be successful
[48:44] in this
[48:45] because all of our preparation all over
[48:48] growing up is to know how to be
[48:49] successful in life
[48:52] so uh in coming to church amen it's
[48:56] preparing you how to handle yourself
[48:58] where you can be successful in the
[49:01] kingdom of god
[49:02] and how to resist the devil and how to
[49:05] defeat the enemy
[49:07] that you can live in the spirit walk in
[49:09] the spirit amen
[49:12] so by the grace of god god is you know
[49:14] taking you to those places where you can
[49:16] come to maturity and i i'm afraid that
[49:20] uh oftentimes we all fail
[49:23] we all fail to be matured christians
[49:27] and failing to become mature christians
[49:30] is because
[49:31] we we don't know where it's coming from
[49:35] amen
[49:36] and i don't care how many times we say
[49:38] what the prophet said our greatest enemy
[49:41] is our
[49:43] ourselves amen i don't care how it
[49:45] cannot be over emphasized
[49:48] because until it gets over to us we
[49:51] always gonna think that our enemies
[49:58] walls and fighting who
[50:01] among you
[50:03] are you with me
[50:05] until we can look at ourselves amen
[50:08] knowing if things that god allows it to
[50:11] he allows it for purpose and things that
[50:14] we go through it is allowed and intended
[50:16] for a purpose that god can bring us into
[50:18] maturity
[50:20] you know joseph brothers i'm talking
[50:23] about friendly fire joseph brothers uh
[50:25] sold him into uh uh slavery and so forth
[50:29] and and
[50:30] and they kept on people kept on doing
[50:32] stuff to joseph but joseph in the
[50:35] process he was
[50:37] getting into maturity are you with me
[50:39] it was all about maturing what kind of
[50:42] what's coming walls and fights and so
[50:44] i'm talking about coming into maturity
[50:46] sometimes you have to go through some
[50:48] troubling things
[50:50] you know i was talking to this um
[50:52] a group yesterday and i was talking
[50:55] about you know
[50:56] certain things you you you learn certain
[50:59] things you experience and so you'll know
[51:01] how amen to encourage others
[51:05] you'll know how to help others amen
[51:07] certain things you learn as parents that
[51:09] you might be able to help your children
[51:11] but while you was going through you was
[51:13] in the learning process but you know now
[51:16] because you've already learned
[51:18] certain things you can tell a young
[51:20] couple what they can go through because
[51:22] you've experienced certain things are
[51:24] you with me
[51:26] so certain things amen that are one that
[51:30] has completed courses sometimes you can
[51:32] uh
[51:33] tutor somebody caleb because you you've
[51:36] already you know went through the math
[51:37] and all that so
[51:39] and rachel and so
[51:41] different ones you you can do help
[51:42] people after after you've gotten help
[51:45] yourself
[51:47] are you with me
[51:48] so there's certain things that you can
[51:50] do amen as a as grandparents brother
[51:53] friends
[51:54] certain things you can do amen that
[51:56] experience what it's like to be a
[51:58] grandparent what it's like amen that you
[52:01] can help people with amen
[52:03] so but by the grace of god if you've
[52:05] never been there you just uh you know
[52:08] because you know you your spiritual god
[52:10] might help you to give a little good
[52:12] advice but it's nothing like you know
[52:14] experiences
[52:16] amen nothing like you know you're
[52:18] experiencing certain things
[52:20] and once you experience certain things
[52:22] you can say well
[52:24] you know i've been there amen once
[52:26] you've been through the battle you've
[52:28] been through the walls then you can
[52:30] speak on it some people are speaking
[52:31] because they learned about it and they
[52:33] read about it but some people have
[52:34] experienced it
[52:37] amen
[52:38] none of us have experienced what uh
[52:40] brother franken sister betty experienced
[52:43] uh we can't speak we can talk about god
[52:46] is a healer and god can bring you back
[52:48] from death doing uh you know all of that
[52:50] but we ain't experiencing
[52:53] so they can you know you know let me
[52:55] tell you what god can do they can speak
[52:57] for me from an experienced standpoint
[53:00] so what i'm saying is is is coming into
[53:04] maturity and coming into uh
[53:07] a church that god can accept amen that
[53:10] you said the bride his wife has made
[53:13] herself ready amen i'm talking about
[53:16] ready to get out of here ready for
[53:17] rapture
[53:20] so we gotta have the mind
[53:23] it says
[53:26] the 11th verse when i was a child i what
[53:32] i'm going to tell you something
[53:33] sometimes we all are victims of still
[53:36] being children
[53:37] and still speaking as children
[53:42] do unto others as they
[53:46] do unto us that's not what jesus says
[53:48] amen
[53:52] that sometimes we still
[53:54] you know using the word to allow
[53:57] advantage
[53:58] for what purpose
[54:01] to consume it upon our own lust
[54:05] amen we use it because we want
[54:08] the bible says not your what
[54:11] yourself
[54:13] for it is written vengeance
[54:16] i will
[54:18] say the lord isn't that right
[54:20] i will repay but sometimes amen when
[54:24] we're children you know we all sometimes
[54:26] respond react out of haste and hurry and
[54:30] we all respond and not even knowing our
[54:33] own response
[54:36] sometimes we cannot love
[54:38] uh uh
[54:40] those that you know really uh have said
[54:42] something or done something to us
[54:44] in past we can't just let it go and said
[54:47] i forgive and it's all over with
[54:49] sometimes we always holding on to it
[54:53] are you with me but when we were
[54:56] children we did that
[54:58] when we were children it was an eye for
[55:00] an eye you know
[55:03] two foot two isn't that right but when
[55:05] we when we grow up in the maturity we
[55:08] become more christ-like
[55:10] he said let this mind be in you that was
[55:12] also
[55:14] in christ what did he do amen how did he
[55:16] do amen they had friendly fire he said
[55:20] father forgive them because they what
[55:24] no not what they do amen it's something
[55:26] about us coming into maturity they meant
[55:29] that the devil does not want a mature
[55:31] church
[55:33] he don't want a mature church that's
[55:35] going to behave and conduct their lives
[55:37] like jesus conducted himself when he was
[55:39] on earth
[55:40] he don't want us to conduct our lives
[55:42] that way so the devil would have us
[55:45] holding on to things that we need to let
[55:48] go
[55:49] amen
[55:50] he knows that you i i'm talking my
[55:53] brother and sister i'm still learning
[55:56] and i'm still growing
[55:58] amen but i'm i'm learning to let go
[56:01] certain things and release them and say
[56:04] it doesn't matter
[56:06] amen we're too close to heaven now
[56:09] i told brother nathan we too close
[56:12] i mean we we we oh no
[56:14] amen what what folk do to us and say
[56:17] about us well man they didn't mean it
[56:20] you know i i said in mueller's the other
[56:22] night i said that that didn't mean
[56:25] what uh they said well what brother
[56:28] branham that said song so he said that
[56:30] didn't mean it it's oh no no we're gonna
[56:32] let it go and i'm gonna tell you
[56:34] something they didn't want bro
[56:36] the brother to let it go but he said
[56:38] that was a trial a name before the
[56:40] foundation in the world i let it go
[56:43] [Music]
[56:47] let it go
[56:50] it don't mean nothing
[56:52] don't hold all this stuff let it go it
[56:54] don't mean nothing what is going to do
[56:56] for you
[56:58] they ain't gonna do a thing to hold on
[57:00] to something somebody said or done to
[57:02] you it ain't gonna do a thing but keep
[57:04] you hurt and keep you feeling bad keep
[57:07] you looking at them strange keep your
[57:08] acting straight no let it go if that did
[57:12] that didn't mean it
[57:16] how about if god just hold something
[57:17] against you
[57:19] and say you've done it yeah i'm not in
[57:21] that and i'm in it no no no no no
[57:23] that's the way the proud i've done it i
[57:25] meant what i didn't know i said it no no
[57:28] no no no no no that's the way the proud
[57:29] god resists the proud he gives grace to
[57:32] the world
[57:33] we don't you know
[57:35] we don't want you to flesh your eyes up
[57:38] god uh does certain things to see what
[57:41] kind of response you're gonna do you're
[57:43] gonna give because he allows certain
[57:44] things to operate now
[57:47] he allows certain things to happen
[57:50] and we give the response sometimes as
[57:53] children
[57:55] not as mature christians
[57:57] i'm not talking about you i'm my media
[57:59] i'm talking about all of us
[58:01] we give responses sometimes and you know
[58:04] god look at us you ain't grown up yet
[58:07] you're not able to handle the swole amen
[58:11] you're not able to handle spoken word
[58:13] you're not able to you know you're not
[58:16] able to come to adoptionism yet you
[58:19] cannot really i cannot give amen full
[58:22] authority and power in your hands as of
[58:25] yet
[58:26] because you need maturity to handle the
[58:29] swole
[58:30] but this is the king sword
[58:33] are you with me
[58:35] so he says
[58:36] here
[58:37] uh when i was a child
[58:39] because you got to my when i was a child
[58:42] i spoke as a child i understood as a
[58:44] child
[58:45] and i
[58:47] and he said i thought as a child
[58:49] you know even you know even our thinking
[58:53] i mean
[58:55] sometimes it's it's childish but we got
[58:57] to elevate
[58:59] we got to be elevated we got to grow
[59:02] i i'm gonna tell you something
[59:05] if your children are teenagers and
[59:07] you're giving them a color book in in
[59:09] church to try to keep them you know
[59:12] give them a little cram and color book
[59:16] okay aaron be good here go some people
[59:20] here to work with
[59:23] i know what renee would give him
[59:27] not a culling book
[59:29] you know what i'm saying
[59:31] but
[59:32] but at the same time we got they got to
[59:35] you got to teach them that we're
[59:37] expecting certain things of you
[59:41] you know and when a child gets to a
[59:43] certain stage you you spiritually we can
[59:47] come to certain levels that the prophet
[59:49] talked about a a nickel a dime a penny a
[59:52] 50 cent piece uh a full dollar
[59:55] you know
[59:57] some people now you can't make 50 cents
[59:59] a dollar
[1:00:02] and you can't make a nickel a dime
[1:00:06] are you with me
[1:00:08] you guys just got to see what what god
[1:00:10] is placing you and you must amen
[1:00:13] all that god gave you amen you must use
[1:00:16] it to its full protection
[1:00:19] everything god gave to you use it to its
[1:00:22] full potential
[1:00:24] and then it may not never equal up to
[1:00:27] what you might think of somebody else
[1:00:29] has
[1:00:30] because god has given you your potion
[1:00:33] and that he's gonna require that which
[1:00:34] he gave you
[1:00:36] in that day
[1:00:38] amen what god has given to you god gonna
[1:00:41] come back to you then what do you do
[1:00:43] with the life that i gave you
[1:00:46] are you with me god what is required of
[1:00:48] you as an individual and that's why
[1:00:50] sometimes what
[1:00:52] sometimes pastors and preachers we can
[1:00:54] try to push you to to to a place that we
[1:00:57] want everybody to be on the same level
[1:01:00] but everybody would never be on the same
[1:01:02] level you got to recognize with your
[1:01:04] children some uh might be straight a
[1:01:07] student some might be a b student and
[1:01:09] some might just make it
[1:01:12] but thank the lord
[1:01:14] but you try to push them to be a because
[1:01:17] so-and-so on his a and plus on his b but
[1:01:20] uh something might have a nice skill a
[1:01:23] nice trade
[1:01:24] and might make
[1:01:25] more money and some more successfully in
[1:01:27] life with that when they got all the
[1:01:30] intellectual knowledge and all but yet
[1:01:32] that don't mean they won't be successful
[1:01:34] in life
[1:01:35] so you got to recognize amen how amen
[1:01:39] i'm pushing you this way and i'm trying
[1:01:41] to make you go to see in in the spirit
[1:01:44] realm there's certain levels and certain
[1:01:46] things that you might desire you might
[1:01:49] look at your own self and think that you
[1:01:51] should be on the level so and so on and
[1:01:54] sometimes people put people up amen in
[1:01:57] church because they've been there the
[1:01:59] longest
[1:02:01] amen because they've been doing this and
[1:02:04] that for a long time but if god can uh
[1:02:08] uh
[1:02:08] you might be max out
[1:02:11] but amen
[1:02:13] and something amen somebody might could
[1:02:15] come and pass your level
[1:02:18] somebody can come and just you know
[1:02:20] do something on that organ and make
[1:02:22] caleb look like amen you're in
[1:02:24] elementary school
[1:02:27] and you and caleb can say now i've been
[1:02:28] here longer nobody was here i mean i

[1:06:06] repentance and who god blessed can't no
[1:06:08] man curse and who god curses everybody
[1:06:10] can bless him
[1:06:12] but we but we got to be mindful how god
[1:06:15] works in the spirit realm and we got to
[1:06:17] sit back and say god you're walking
[1:06:19] you're moving let god move
[1:06:22] don't put brakes on god let the holy
[1:06:25] ghost move
[1:06:26] let god use you amen as much as he wants
[1:06:29] him when he don't need you say well let
[1:06:32] me be here and let me push the other
[1:06:34] fellow
[1:06:36] are you what man
[1:06:37] god let me let me be spiritual enough
[1:06:40] amen just to push you off the fella you
[1:06:42] know what
[1:06:43] god uh elect you
[1:06:45] he began to advance you he began to take
[1:06:47] you to levels because you got the right
[1:06:49] attitude
[1:06:51] are you look man when you got the right
[1:06:53] attitude god might let you become the
[1:06:55] coach
[1:06:59] are you with me
[1:07:01] then you're still at a place that you on
[1:07:03] another level why because you had the
[1:07:05] right attitude and look at god begin to
[1:07:08] impart some things amen that you didn't
[1:07:10] know was in you because you had the
[1:07:12] right attitude god is going to
[1:07:14] continually bless you
[1:07:17] amen you wouldn't have never discovered
[1:07:19] certain things that certain things
[1:07:20] wouldn't have happened
[1:07:23] are you with me
[1:07:25] but if you'd have had a bad attitude god
[1:07:27] could not give you what he wanted to
[1:07:29] give you in that particular instance
[1:07:33] are you up man
[1:07:34] it's your attitude the right attitude
[1:07:38] amen that god can give you amen things
[1:07:41] that you never thought you could have
[1:07:44] blessing that you couldn't have room
[1:07:46] enough to receive
[1:07:48] because you kept the right attitude
[1:07:53] not take your ball and go home
[1:07:58] okay so
[1:07:59] uh by the grace of god
[1:08:01] we're going places in christ
[1:08:03] the church is a need that the church
[1:08:07] moved quickly into maturity amen the
[1:08:11] church moved quickly
[1:08:13] into maturity there has to be
[1:08:15] a a quick move
[1:08:17] into maturity to understand that god is
[1:08:21] calling
[1:08:22] the church into perfection
[1:08:24] amen calling them to capstone ministry
[1:08:27] headstones
[1:08:28] god is calling us to a place in christ
[1:08:32] amen that we must attain we must reach
[1:08:35] and it's an urgent it's an urgent time
[1:08:38] it's a time to pray it's a time to seek
[1:08:41] god because god is doing something in
[1:08:43] the spirit realm as much as the urgency
[1:08:46] is one virus after another and stuff is
[1:08:49] coming up on the natural that is it it's
[1:08:52] causing a shake up in the world and
[1:08:55] shake up
[1:08:56] and and from all angles
[1:08:58] the economy everything shook up
[1:09:01] amen was because god is saying when the
[1:09:04] enemy come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:09:06] the lord will live of a standing
[1:09:08] are you with me
[1:09:10] so god has got a standard amen that he's
[1:09:12] going to give you and i
[1:09:16] and so the bride must
[1:09:18] quickly
[1:09:19] advance in maturity
[1:09:22] quickly grow up
[1:09:24] don't let things amen shake you up no
[1:09:27] more
[1:09:28] grow up fast
[1:09:30] amen because god is requiring certain
[1:09:33] things now he says
[1:09:35] uh
[1:09:36] i thought as a child i understood as a
[1:09:38] child
[1:09:40] and what brother caleb but when i
[1:09:43] became a but when i became a man i put
[1:09:45] away childish things when we become now
[1:09:49] now we don't we never come a man we're
[1:09:51] not gonna never put away childish things
[1:09:54] now you might understand that david
[1:09:57] before he could get to the throne
[1:09:59] that
[1:10:00] you know
[1:10:01] he he killed goliath and all of that was
[1:10:03] good but that didn't last but a little
[1:10:05] while sometimes certain victories in
[1:10:08] your wall
[1:10:09] amen where god want to take you certain
[1:10:12] victories don't end it amen when
[1:10:14] everybody's you know patting you on the
[1:10:16] back because amen you just killed the
[1:10:18] giant and amen everybody loves you but
[1:10:21] it won't be long but for somebody to get
[1:10:23] jealous of you
[1:10:25] are you with me
[1:10:27] and the one that got jealous of him
[1:10:30] was
[1:10:31] the one that amen david was anointed
[1:10:33] king and he didn't know it and i'm going
[1:10:35] to tell you brother and sister if god
[1:10:37] has ordained you before the foundation
[1:10:39] of the world as known as you as kings
[1:10:41] and priests before him it meant the
[1:10:43] world is going to get jealous of you
[1:10:46] and then amen
[1:10:48] now god had given uh
[1:10:50] saul the position as king
[1:10:53] and and why he's going to be jealous of
[1:10:55] david amen which david loved him and
[1:10:58] david respected him and david was gonna
[1:11:00] you know
[1:11:02] he was all right but the women you know
[1:11:04] this outside forces
[1:11:07] the women began to sing that saul has
[1:11:10] killed his thousand but david has killed
[1:11:13] his
[1:11:15] ten thousand
[1:11:16] so they
[1:11:17] and saul said uh um
[1:11:20] you see what they doing
[1:11:22] they they're disrespecting my leadership
[1:11:25] and their exalting david which uh yeah
[1:11:28] uh huh uh i'm not gonna put up with that
[1:11:32] are you with me
[1:11:34] see what happens is amen when there's a
[1:11:37] position they'll change
[1:11:39] where god is doing something and
[1:11:41] bringing somebody instead of us being
[1:11:43] glad for them we get jealous of them
[1:11:47] are you with me that's a lack of that's
[1:11:49] immaturity
[1:11:51] instead of getting jealous we ought to
[1:11:53] be glad for him and thank god well he
[1:11:55] thank you so much she thinks she's up i
[1:11:58] can sing together well i don't know why
[1:12:00] they don't call on me
[1:12:05] yeah they be calling on me i've been
[1:12:07] doing that years before they started
[1:12:14] who they think they are
[1:12:17] you know it's all kind of spirits get on
[1:12:19] people
[1:12:20] all kind of attitudes come out of people
[1:12:23] and saul got his little attitude
[1:12:28] i i why did why didn't it say saul had
[1:12:31] killed his ten thousand david killed his
[1:12:32] thousand
[1:12:34] what what's going on in here
[1:12:37] you know the church having an uh uh uh
[1:12:39] we're having revival a move of god and
[1:12:42] the enemy's being destroyed we have a
[1:12:44] victory out the victory and they're
[1:12:46] gonna exalt somebody over me i'm the
[1:12:48] king
[1:12:50] who they think they are i'm the pastor
[1:12:54] you know what i'm saying don't
[1:12:56] let us not be mindful
[1:12:59] amen god amen has already foresaw david
[1:13:03] and the kind of heart he had and god was
[1:13:06] giving respect
[1:13:08] amen but he's on our side
[1:13:11] let's not have friendly fire
[1:13:14] and when saul got disturbed by evil
[1:13:17] spirit from the law trouble him and
[1:13:19] david come and play
[1:13:21] and give him peace all of that david was
[1:13:23] displaying
[1:13:25] and that was the man that wanted to kill
[1:13:27] him
[1:13:28] he took a javelin and he quoted that
[1:13:31] david tried to
[1:13:33] you know what i'm saying
[1:13:35] and david had to run for his life
[1:13:37] because saul was seeking to kill him the
[1:13:40] man that fought in his army and fought
[1:13:42] the battles for him and always you know
[1:13:44] what i'm saying with the people you try
[1:13:46] to help the people you stand in the gap
[1:13:48] for the people you lean on your life for
[1:13:51] sometimes the ma oh our enemies are the
[1:13:54] foes of our own house
[1:13:57] friendly

[1:14:00] are you a man
[1:14:02] because they don't understand he came
[1:14:04] into his own but his own received them
[1:14:07] not they didn't understand him

[1:14:31] because the message is to y'all
[1:14:34] and i said i won't go to something i'll
[1:14:36] stay here
[1:14:37] you know
[1:14:38] it's it it's something that god said i'm
[1:14:40] calling the people to an urgency of
[1:14:42] becoming mature
[1:14:44] amen stop acting quit you like me and
[1:14:47] stop acting like babies

[1:15:10] is focusing on getting our attention
[1:15:12] where he can take his way we need to be
[1:15:14] where he wants us to be
[1:15:16] oh you look man
[1:15:20] so by the grace of god

[1:15:43] because they were calling them
[1:15:46] he said i could not forget you with meat
[1:15:49] because
[1:15:50] you ain't able to bad i got to stay with
[1:15:52] milk because you're calling the money

[1:16:01] to advance the bride to take her into
[1:16:04] his arms and say i love you and let's go
[1:16:07] to the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:16:10] are you with me

[1:20:33] my mind
[1:20:35] when i desire to do good what
[1:20:38] he was present with me amen
[1:20:40] so he says but the weapon

[1:21:17] and the only way it's going to die amen
[1:21:20] you got to allow amen it to be destroyed
[1:21:23] mortified therefore your members upon
[1:21:25] the earth
[1:21:27] are you with me you got to die out to
[1:21:29] yourself as paul said i die daily
[1:21:33] are you with me
[1:21:35] so you got to realize that even the
[1:21:37] enemy that i got that's the greatest one
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:41] how am i gonna kill it how god gonna
[1:21:43] kill it amen because you're gonna
[1:21:45] overcome evil with what
[1:21:48] good you're gonna love your enemies
[1:21:50] you're gonna forgive those no matter
[1:21:52] what they do or say about you you're
[1:21:54] gonna have forgiveness in your heart
[1:21:58] and the love for them
[1:22:00] you're not gonna hold it against them
[1:22:03] are you with me
[1:22:05] go head on
[1:22:07] you lust and have not you kill and
[1:22:10] desire to have and cannot attain
[1:22:12] you fight you you kill the desire to
[1:22:15] have
[1:22:16] but go ahead
[1:22:17] you fight in war yet ye have not because
[1:22:21] you ask not
[1:22:23] yes yet you have not because you ask not
[1:22:26] you know
[1:22:28] it was said a lot of people praying
[1:22:30] and they're acting
[1:22:32] but they're not receiving
[1:22:35] the reason why they're not receiving
[1:22:38] it's because what they're asking for
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:44] it's for a purpose
[1:22:46] they want to consume it you know people
[1:22:48] pray and cry to god nice for and it's
[1:22:51] not going to present humility
[1:22:54] it's going to make them oh
[1:22:56] i know the lord heard my prayers and i
[1:22:58] prayed for this one and they got well
[1:23:00] and i literally died you know all about
[1:23:03] them
[1:23:06] a lot of times i've been accused
[1:23:08] the president said i think he's just
[1:23:10] talking think he can do this and all can
[1:23:12] use him and i'll use me too i said
[1:23:15] so i know god god keep us humble keep us
[1:23:19] watchful
[1:23:20] you see because sometimes what folks
[1:23:22] think about you
[1:23:24] and what folks say about you
[1:23:26] it doesn't matter
[1:23:29] it doesn't matter
[1:23:31] but what does matter
[1:23:33] when you come up against the enemy
[1:23:35] that god comes and vindicate who you are
[1:23:39] are you with me
[1:23:40] sometimes god will let things happen and
[1:23:42] he'll say hey
[1:23:45] this my daughter
[1:23:47] that's my son
[1:23:49] and folks will keep on talking they
[1:23:51] might talk more but god will vindicate
[1:23:54] who you are
[1:23:55] it doesn't matter god approve it don't
[1:23:57] worry about it amen
[1:23:59] god approve who you are if you just keep
[1:24:02] on loving and don't let the outside
[1:24:05] world bother you
[1:24:08] stay humble
[1:24:10] don't try to prove your right
[1:24:13] and them wrong because that's charlie's
[1:24:16] stuff
[1:24:17] i didn't know i don't want to tell you
[1:24:19] i'm right and you're wrong no no no no
[1:24:22] that's all right you can be right then
[1:24:24] finally ain't got time who right who
[1:24:27] wrote who said this who said that ain't
[1:24:29] got time for that
[1:24:31] it's time for maturity let's go to
[1:24:33] heaven
[1:24:35] are you with me
[1:24:37] because that don't matter anyway it
[1:24:39] ain't no it ain't nothing
[1:24:40] we're falling
[1:24:42] up but when you're a child you think oh
[1:24:45] no no no
[1:24:47] mommy hey mommy
[1:24:50] you saying something about me the
[1:24:52] teacher go go to school tell that
[1:24:53] teacher
[1:24:55] mama
[1:24:56] you say something about my child
[1:25:01] got to stay in prayer
[1:25:03] and make sure you go in the right spirit
[1:25:05] if you got to go
[1:25:06] but a lot of times you you might not
[1:25:08] have to go
[1:25:10] until you get a word from the law
[1:25:13] see you got to get a word from the law
[1:25:15] sometimes we get overprotective
[1:25:20] uh are you with me
[1:25:21] sometimes we're in a hurry before we
[1:25:23] pray
[1:25:24] and see what god has to say about it
[1:25:28] because we can get
[1:25:30] we can get we can fight for somebody
[1:25:32] that god ain't fighting for
[1:25:34] god trying to get him a good uh lesson a
[1:25:37] good weapon
[1:25:38] and we don't took off in front of god
[1:25:40] and god honoring you because he honors
[1:25:42] you
[1:25:44] are you a man
[1:25:46] god honors you because of who you are
[1:25:48] with him
[1:25:50] but sometimes we need to let sometimes
[1:25:52] folk go through certain things because
[1:25:55] god is trying to bring them as
[1:25:56] individuals into maturity
[1:25:58] but sometimes we ain't gonna let them
[1:26:00] get their weapons
[1:26:03] are you with me
[1:26:06] are y'all with me sometimes we stop god
[1:26:09] from chastising somebody because we
[1:26:12] think that god don't know what he's
[1:26:14] doing
[1:26:16] if we'd only prayed about it god would
[1:26:18] say hold your peace
[1:26:21] be still because i'm god
[1:26:24] are you with me
[1:26:26] i was in prayer yesterday and i started
[1:26:29] praying for a child
[1:26:32] and i started praying and i just
[1:26:34] i was shocked
[1:26:38] i just prayed and kept praying for the
[1:26:40] child because i was you know
[1:26:42] closing out praying with the family and
[1:26:45] i'm praying
[1:26:46] i started praying for the child
[1:26:48] because the child standing there holding
[1:26:50] hands with us
[1:26:51] and i just what they were praying
[1:26:53] and calling their child's name and just
[1:26:55] praying
[1:26:59] and the grandmama said
[1:27:01] you know something
[1:27:04] you didn't know what happened the other
[1:27:05] day
[1:27:07] this child
[1:27:09] just got beat up
[1:27:11] pushed his head down
[1:27:13] teeth broken
[1:27:16] being bullied at school
[1:27:18] and you started in a scene praying that
[1:27:20] god would send his angels to camp about
[1:27:23] him and to do this to that so you didn't
[1:27:26] know that did you
[1:27:28] you didn't know why he was calling his
[1:27:30] name
[1:27:31] how you start zeroing in on the prayer
[1:27:34] as we're getting ready to dismiss
[1:27:36] from
[1:27:38] here
[1:27:39] and you're going to praying like that i
[1:27:41] said well you know i didn't know
[1:27:43] but god knew isn't that right see that's
[1:27:46] what i'm saying god will fight for you
[1:27:48] if you just
[1:27:49] let god do it amen
[1:27:51] but some are parents that child did my
[1:27:53] child like that i'm going to school now
[1:27:55] i'm alright let me see that child
[1:27:58] you know but god will take care of
[1:27:59] things for you just be still and know
[1:28:02] that i'm god
[1:28:04] are you with me
[1:28:05] god is good he'll take care of things
[1:28:08] for you
[1:28:09] you know i'm looking for you know
[1:28:12] greater results for that child in his
[1:28:14] life
[1:28:15] okay
[1:28:17] go ahead hold on i got to i got to close
[1:28:19] i better close nine i just
[1:28:21] i'm closing in the middle of this lesson
[1:28:25] god is good amen
[1:28:26] but i wanted to show you some things
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:31] i wanted to show you the friendship of
[1:28:32] the work pride
[1:28:34] maybe it's just a little lesson how
[1:28:38] what caused
[1:28:39] war in heaven
[1:28:41] what caused lucifer to act up
[1:28:43] it was the battle of the wheels
[1:28:46] and there's a battle right now of the
[1:28:48] wheels
[1:28:49] god will
[1:28:51] and your will
[1:28:53] are you wiping
[1:28:56] lucifer said
[1:28:57] i will
[1:28:59] amen
[1:29:01] so his will to do
[1:29:03] what he want
[1:29:06] because of pride his heart was lifted up
[1:29:10] if he can help cause war in heaven what
[1:29:13] about wall going on among us
[1:29:15] which comes as walls and fire it's
[1:29:17] because of pride
[1:29:19] and if you read on nine and james he
[1:29:21] said god resisted the what
[1:29:24] pride
[1:29:25] and giving grace to the world
[1:29:28] and that's what we're dealing with
[1:29:29] people god is trying to let us recognize
[1:29:32] he's expecting matured christians to be
[1:29:35] be humble
[1:29:36] people it's not the proud he resists the
[1:29:40] pride but give lord
[1:29:42] you know
[1:29:45] all things
[1:29:46] will work together to the good to them
[1:29:48] to love you
[1:29:50] it's going to work to my good anyhow i'm
[1:29:52] not worried about it
[1:29:54] you know i'm not worried about it's
[1:29:56] going to work it's working to my good
[1:29:59] if god allows it it's going to work to
[1:30:01] my good
[1:30:03] but if i get myself in the way
[1:30:06] as thought saul said i touch not god's
[1:30:09] anointed
[1:30:11] amen they say
[1:30:13] david had a chance to take saul ahead
[1:30:16] the kill song and he said he told us he
[1:30:18] told his uh the ones that was with him
