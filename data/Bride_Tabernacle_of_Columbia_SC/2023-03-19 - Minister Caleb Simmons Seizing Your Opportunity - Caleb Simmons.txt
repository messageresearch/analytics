the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen at this time he asked you if you got your Bibles this morning and you turn to a familiar scripture Matthew chapter 19. [Music] amen Matthew chapter 19. I know it's a familiar scripture and we'll start in verse 16 this morning when you gotta say man amen and it reads and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments and he saith unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt shall do no murder thou shall commit thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness however thy father and I honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself in the young man and the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet and Jesus said unto him that thou will be perfect go and sell that thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me amen God bless you read another's word you may be seated this morning amen God is good amen this morning I'd like to speak on a short small topic and I I entitled it seizing the opportunity seizing the opportunity amen amen this morning this young man he had an opportunity to do something with it with his life he had his opportunity and Jesus came before me and he went to Jesus and he asked him what can I do what can I do I've done all the things that people have told me to do I've done all the scriptures according to what I'm supposed to do but what else can I do see he had a decided to do something else with his life he had a desire to do something greater with his life and he said what can I do and Jesus said if you follow these Commandments he said I've been doing these since since my youth and Jesus said well I got one more request of you he said I want you to go and sell all that you have and give it to the poor and as you read down in the scripture in verse 22 and I'll keep reading but when the young men heard that saying he went away sorrowful but he had great possessions see this young man came to an opportunity and it was presented to him and he had to make a decision do I go for this opportunity or do I keep what I have am I satisfied with where I am and what position I'm already at or do I go for a greater opportunity and this opportunity that was set before it was greater than what he had because he didn't realize that this opportunity was for eternal life this opportunity was greater than all the possessions that he had on this Earth it was for eternal life but he had to but he came to the position where he had to choose which opportunity he was going to take which opportunity he was going to possess while he was here on Earth and he came and he said and Jesus gave him the opportunity but what did he do with it what opportunity did he take he decided to keep what he had he decided to keep it and he missed out on eternal life and he missed out on going to heaven he missed out on all the riches and all the glory that God was going to give him if he just did this one small thing and see I looked up the word opportunity and it says it's a time or occasion that is right for doing something a good chance see God always gives you an opportunity he always gives you a good chance it gives you something an ability to choose the right thing he gives you a moment in time where you can make a choice where you can make a decision but you have to choose is the opportunity worth it and sometimes someone may come and say hey I got this great this great opportunity if you take this job you can do such and such and so and so and you say you know what that sound good that sound real good or I can stay where I'm at or I can stay here and it may seem stable but you didn't know that this was going to take you to Greater opportunities it was going to open doors because you never could have dreamed of but you said I'm gonna stay where I am I'm gonna stay here because it seems stable it seems like I'm satisfied with where I am but it was a greater opportunity presented for you and that's what God he comes to you and he does the same thing he presents a great opportunity for you he puts it in front of you and say what will you do with it it's your choice it's your choice it's your decision this morning whether you want to choose the right opportunity or stay where you are because whether you know it or not if you're not moving forward you you you're not stand still you may think that you are but it but you're not many of times that you are always opportunities are set before you but you have to make a choice you have to make a choice where am I going with this you may can't you may not see with the levels that this opportunity may give you you may not see all the blessings and things that may come with this opportunity because it may not be shown to you you're just giving a simple opportunity many times is the difference between right and wrong it's just that simple whether you want to make the right decision or not but it's an opportunity you don't look at it like that because maybe you don't see it through the eyes that others may see it I said many of times we come to things what is an opportunity to one may not be an opportunity to another why because of perspective because one can see oh this is going to do this for me but another may say I can't see that it's all in what you see but God has the ultimate perspective he knows the end from the beginning he's Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end so he knows what's coming and what shall be and see he said I'm going to give you this opportunity because it's going to lead you to eternal life it's going to lead you to greater things than you can ever imagine but you want to stay where you are see you have the opportunity this morning and this genre truly he had the opportunity to do something better to do something greater but he said I'm satisfied so I want to ask you are you satisfied are you satisfied with where you are this morning are you satisfied with the position that you're at this morning or do you want something greater do you want something that's going to last through eternity because that's what God has to offer this morning amen there are many examples in the Bible where it shows you that many people came to these moments where they had opportunities they had opportunities to do greater they had opportunities to do the right thing but they didn't I think of the story of Cain and Abel there were two brothers that came together and one they they started they had to come and they had to offer a sacrifice it was an opportunity to do the right thing but one didn't understand that that that the sacrifice had to be a blood sacrifice one said I'm just going to offer up I think my best but there was something greater that he can offer up it was something greater there was a greater opportunity for him to take the chance and Cain came to it and he said I want to offer up all the fruits of this field but that's not what God wanted to God wanted the blood to be shed because that's the only thing that could take away sin amen so there was an opportunity but he came and he instead of him instead of him doing what his brother Abel did and offering up a sacrifice that was acceptable he killed his brother he killed his brother that was that was the thing that he did and God came to him and and Cain had an opportunity to repent Cain came and God said where where is your brother he said I'm Not My Brother's Keeper she can't have the opportunity to say you know what I'm sorry I messed up I made a bad decision and and did and I'm repenting of that but Cain decided not to see he took the wrong opportunity he took the wrong path but he could have he had the opportunity to do the right thing because it was presented before him and see God always gives you the opportunity to do the right thing he always comes to you and say you got a choice you can choose writer you can choose wrong but it's your choice I don't force you to do anything that you don't want to do but it's your choice I don't force you to walk in any door that you don't want to walk into but it's your choice and if you hear that voice inside you in your in your head and from your heart that speaks to you and say don't do that it's a choice it's something that's warning you that the there's consequences to what you do there's a there's consequences to the decisions that you make there's consequences to the doors that you walk through the places that you go those things have an influence on you but see there's opportunities to do the right thing there's opportunities to walk through the right doors there's opportunities to make the right decision well what choice are you making each and every day you walk you wake up and God gives you the opportunity and the chance and the ability to make the right decision but what decisions are you making you don't may not see the impact of decision these decisions but they have an impact the Bible says what you sow that's therefore you shall read so what sees your plant in the day that's the fruits that you're going to see of that tree maybe not tomorrow it may take years many times when you go and you see an apple you eat the apple and there's something in the Apple there's a seed and then that seed is an apple tree but you don't see the apple tree when you look at the seed all you see is something very small you see it very small but in there is a great apple tree and see that's that's how your decisions can affect your life you plan to see today but you don't realize the impact it may have 5 10 15 years from now if God permits and God Wills but it's an opportunity to choose and do the right thing with that seed it's an opportunity to take that seed you can plant it in good ground you can plant it in good soil or you can plant that seed in Rocky stormy soil and it'll die and see God gives you the opportunity to plant the seed in good ground and he and he fertiles the ground and he tills the ground and he gives the water and Sun like that that seed May grow but it's what opportunities and what choices are you making we come further in the scripture and we see that pilate he had the same opportunity pilate he had Jesus there before him if you look in Matthew chapter 27 and Jesus came before him after he had been captured and Judas had an opportunity before Jesus came to pilate Judas could have chosen not to betray Jesus he could have chosen but instead Judas he made he chose the opportunity to make some money he chose the opportunity to make some money and you say what is money in the grand scheme of things because Judas couldn't take the money with him after he got done betraying Jesus he decided to throw the money and try to give it back but he couldn't do that they said what is money to us see the money had no value but Judas took the money in the moment because that was the opportunity presented before him see Judas chose the wrong opportunity but he he wanted the money and then he came and there was another person he come a little bit further in the story there was pilate after Jesus had been captured and taken to pilate pilate had the opportunity to to he had the opportunity and we'll start in let's start in verse 11 and it says 27-11 and Jesus stood before the governor the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him thou say yes and when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders he answered nothing then said pilate unto here here is thou not how many things they witnessed against thee and he answered him never a word in so much that the governor marveled greatly now at that Feast the governors want to release unto the people of prisoner whom they would and they and they had been a notable prisoner called Barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto unto them whom will will ye that I release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ see the people had an opportunity to do the right thing they had an opportunity that they could choose Jesus or they could choose a notorious criminal but they came and they they colluded together and they got together and they said you know what we don't want Jesus we don't want him let's get the criminal now he was a known criminal and everyone knew him but they said we'd rather have him than have Jesus a man that had done no sin had done no wrong and only was helpful to the people but they had an opportunity to choose the right thing but they didn't and see in verse 18 it said for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him so he pilate the governor knew that they were just jealous of Jesus and that was the only reason that they had brought him to them and see and when he had sat down on the Judgment seat his wife sent out to him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him see sometimes when the opportunity is presented before you and you're about to head in the wrong direction God sends you warnings God sends something along your path to tell you hey you didn't listen when I sent my sin of that little voice I'm going to send you something greater to get your attention I'm going to let something happen right in front of you to show you this is the way it's going to go but you can got the opportunity to listen or not many times God comes and he speaks and you hear it and you say oh that wasn't for me oh that was for somebody else but many times that's when God is trying to get your attention and trying to knock on your door and trying to tell you to wake up this is for you this is your opportunity but what are you gonna do with it are you going to just let it pass by are you going to take the opportunity and say you know what this is for me this might not have been for no one else but this is for me and I'm going to seize my opportunity see that's the you got to step out on faith and seize the opportunity that God places in front of you and see God sends those warnings to get your attention all the things that may be happening in the world in life right now it may be just there to get your attention so why are these things happening because there's an opportunity presented before you and God is trying to warn you to take the right path God is trying to get your attention to say you need to do the right thing and I've given you the opportunity but what will you do with it and see as you go on he said by the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for rabbits and Destroy Jesus Jesus see there were some people that was persuading them and many of times you may have influences around you that's trying to persuade you to change the wrong opportunity that's trying to persuade you to go the wrong path and trying to influence you and make you choose the wrong direction but what are you going to do what are you going to do are you going to seize the right opportunity are you are you just going to go with the flow you're just going to go with everyone because they're persuading you to choose the wrong thing and the governor answered and said unto them whether the twain will ye that I release unto you and they said Barabbas and pilate said unto you what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ and they said unto him let him be crucified see Potter came to the pivotal moment where he could have chose something different but he asked him excuse me he asked them what will I do what will I do with the opportunity and they said let us crucify him and the governor said why what evil has he done but they cried out the more sin let him be crucified when pilate saw that he could know of it could Prevail nothing but that rather tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person c e to it see pilate he chose an alternative route but he had the power to let him go he had the power to say you know what you're a free man because he had that Authority and that power in that moment to do something great but he he took a different opportunity he said I'd rather not have nothing to do with this but he needed he needed Jesus because Jesus was the one that could forgive him of his sins amen see there was an opportunity for him to do something greater but he chose not to do it see there's so many things in the scripture to show you what you can do and how God can can manifest his ways in his life but see there was purpose in this opportunity see Jesus had to go to the Cross because there was a greater opportunity he had to go to the Cross he had to go and die for your sin not for many maybe not for some people that don't take the right opportunity but he did it for you and me he did it he shed his blood for you and me and he came to the cross and he died because there was a greater opportunity he wanted to give the whole world a chance to see him he wanted to give a whole world a chance to reap eternal life but see you have to choose the right opportunity to get there you have to make the conscious decision and Lord I want to surrender my life to you but what I want to give you my heart I want to give you my life Lord I want you to use Me For Your Glory see that's the opportunity that you want to give and that's the opportunity that's presented before you this morning but what choices are you making are you making the right decision are you making the right choice are you seizing the right opportunities in your life are you stepping forward and say Lord that's what I want you to do in my life are you seizing it sometimes you have to step out and go against the grain that's what season the opportunity is about you have to step out you have to put forth some effort you got to do something different than everyone else that's around you see that seizing the opportunity that's not just gone because it's there you seize it you got to step out you got to do something you got to do something that's different you got to seize the opportunity see Jesus always knew what was going to happen he always knew that this was a greater opportunity this was a greater opportunity than what was set before and see he even said that after I'm gone I will leave my spirit that he may lead and guide you see God sent these these moments and you have to seize the opportunity you have to seize the opportunity to not just be there but Lord I want to be more I want to do more Lord I want to be used by you Lord I want you to take my life and Lord I want you to leave me in the right direction Lord I want to labor for you Lord that you may do something you may do a work in my life that that not only does my words testify but my life does as well not only what I do and then what I say but Lord also when people see me they know that that you are working through me they know that you are that you're doing a work in my life sometimes the greatest testimony that you can have is your life you can say many things but people will always watch and look how you live you may say the Lord Jesus is the Lord and savior of my life but how is your life living how are you living your life people knew that Jesus was a Healer because of the works that he did people knew that Jesus was a savior because he saved so many see they knew because of his life his life testified of who he was his life testified of who he was so so if you're a Christian does your life testify of it see that's the opportunity that you have today that you may profess him and that you may repent of your sins and that you may be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says it's a promise given to you but are you seizing the promises of God are you seizing the opportunities and all the blessings that God has in store for you or are you just letting those Pastor by and said the opportunity Is Not Great enough for me that opportunity is not worth for me I said when will an opportunity be great enough for you to take it or to take a risk on it some people say you know what I'm not going to risk it because I'm stable I seem to be stable but just know that all it takes is one bump in the road to rock your ship all it takes is one small little Iceberg to rock your ship and you're sinking one of the greatest ships of all time that was built they called it Titanic and and they built this huge ship and then one day they're out on the ocean and they see the small Iceberg and they say you know what we gonna pass because we're so great and we're so mighty we're so we're so great and that this ship can go through anything we built it it's it's the most amazing ship that we had built at the time and so they took this and they said they had the opportunity to maybe go a different direction or to go around but they said we're not going to worry about that we're not going to worry about that but they didn't realize once they hit that Iceberg it was gonna sink their it was going to sink their ship and they were going to lose so many hundreds of and out maybe thousands of lives because they didn't take the right opportunity they didn't choose the right direction to go they went away that they they thought that looked good at the time when they started out their Journey but they didn't see the troubles in the trials and tribulations that was coming down the road they didn't see the the things but they took an opportunity and what looked nice and plain and good when they first started see they didn't seize the right opportunity they didn't take it see this a great opportunity that set before you I said if someone was to offer you today a hundred dollars and they say all you had to do was take it would you take it how many would take you how many would take it let me see I see some people that wouldn't take it Lord have mercy Lord have mercy do does it have to be greater for you to take it and someone had five hundred dollars would you take it let me see a thousand anybody okay now we're getting more consensus this morning see that's what that's what somebody would take a hundred dollars but it was there and it was free somebody said you know what I want better but what's what's the best thing that you can have if you can't have eternal life is there anything greater than your soul is there anything worth more than your soul this morning there's no money in the world that can count for your soul all the money if you had Elon Musk money it wouldn't even count for the greatest riches that are in heaven there's nothing that can compare to the beauty that shall be desired in him there's nothing that you can give that's worth more than reaching and then having eternal life but are you seizing the opportunity for eternal life are you seizing that opportunity to accept before you this morning because you have the opportunity to have eternal life you have the opportunity to come to Jesus and say Lord I Thank you for Dying For Me Lord I know that when you went to Calvary you shed your blood for me you didn't mind not you shed your blood for everyone but Lord I want to seize the opportunity and take that opportunity to say Lord thank you for saving for sharing your blood for me and Lord I accept and Lord I ask for forgiveness for my sins that's what seasonal opportunity is all about is stepping forward and say Lord I'm taking this opportunity the Lord to give you my life the Lord set myself apart so that Lord you may use me that you may gain all the glory and all the honor and the praise out of my life because Lord I give my life to you as the song says I give myself away that you can use me see I come to you got to come to those moments that God gives you the opportunity for salvation God gives you the opportunity for rededication God gives you the opportunity to come before him and say as long as you're living and you got breath in your body Lord I can do better than I'm doing today Lord I can give you more than I'm getting than I gave you yesterday Lord I can I can lean down and I can give you a greater sacrifice even if my sacrifices Just Praise even if my sacrifice is just prayer Lord even if my sacrifice is Lord just telling somebody about you I can give you a greater sacrifice because Lord you gave me a great opportunity you gave me a great moment and you gave me another day the Lord give you the glory give you the honor and say this is the day that the Lord has made and I will rejoice and be glad in it see there's great opportunity this morning Lord I can always come to you and give you more Lord David said
