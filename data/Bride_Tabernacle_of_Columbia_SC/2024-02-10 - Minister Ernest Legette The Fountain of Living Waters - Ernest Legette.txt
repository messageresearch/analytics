Jeremiah 2 little something I was ministering on on Sunday and I preaching on broken sisters but the same thing but tonight we want to talk little more a little about Living Waters amen Jeremiah 2 And1 if you got it say amen and it reads have not a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit be astonished all ye Heavens at this and be terribly afraid be ye very desolate sayeth the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and have heed themselves heed hewed out heue them out sisters broken sisters that cannot that can hold no water is Israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled the Young Lions roared upon him and yelled and they have made his land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant may God have bless to reading of his word may be seated tonight by the grace of God just for a moment amen we said we want to talk about Living Waters amen you know uh sitting here and you know there something that was on my heart and and I was thinking about you know I was just going over and reading over the book of Jeremiah here lately and you know and and and the things that you know he was prophesying and mostly you know what he was trying there at the beginning was to call the people to a back to a repentance State you know to repentance to let the you let them know you know y'all you have gone astray and God is calling you back and if you don't come back God is going to punish you you know but the people weren't listening at that time were they and the thing is the reason why they weren't listening is because a lot of times you know they had too many other voices in the land of that day same as uh you know we deal with today was Jeremiah was crying out you know and the Lord put the word in Jeremiah's mouth and he was crying out to the people to come back to God or or the Babylonians was going to come and burn this city with fire and yet you had other prophets at that time too false prophets crying out to the people telling the people that everything is all right you all right you all right God is going to come Deliver Us One the place they said Egypt going to come and then but Jeremiah was telling them Egypt ain't going to come they going to go right back where they came from and say I'm telling you you know to repent if you turn from your ways God will God will restore you God will visit you but if you don't you're going into captivity but he had a lot of things thinking he had a lot to contend with in those days you know a lot of was so many other voices and what it was all the other voices you know as Jeremiah was calling the people to repentance all the other voices were telling the people you all right everything all right every all is well you know and I says you know a lot of times ain't that what you know we deal with in the hour that we live in as the Bible declared that you know Darkness was going to cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people right and you try to say 10 tell the people today that the world is is not getting any better it's only getting in worse going in Gross Darkness so we we find ourselves a lot of times you know uh like Paul says dying daily searching your own self out your own soul salvation with fear and tremble searching yourself out calling you always find yourself in a repentant State saying Lord I want to search my I want you to search my heart try my reign I don't want to feel like you know oh I'm all right I'm all right cuz what that's that's the the makeover of the Mind that the devil want to put on the people that likey Daisy everything is all right everything is all right and nobody really come into a repent of State because there's so many other voices saying yay yay yay but yet the voice of God is crying out no y'all believe that tonight so I says that Jeremiah had a lot to contend with but no matter how many other other voices there were in that day coming against what Jeremiah was saying Jeremiah had what the word of the Lord was and you know I believe he said one place I'm going to make your word like fire and the people like wood right but I says what it is you know it just just Liv looking here at how you know uh uh uh Jeremiah was saying here and prophesying he was saying you know the the people have committed two evils against me he says they have tra they have uh uh forsaken me you know and that's the thing God in this journey he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but the people have forsaken him and they turn and they say a lot of times where is God or they or they'll you know just going in their ways but God said he'll never forsake you and that's what it is he says they have committed two evils and they have forsaken me and he called himself the Fountain of Living Waters come on you know as we always been saying here the last couple of weeks if if you would only know what God want to do for your life if you would only know the depths that God want to take you to but a lot of times you know the the people they don't they don't stay long enough to see The Depths because what happens God you can be in a you can be in a bad state or whatever in a bad condition and just like Israel was down in Egypt but they sighed and cried by the reason of bondage didn't they but then all then God and he sends a prophet down to deliver them oh they rejoicing shouting and rejoicing as a prophet came down to bring them out but it wasn't long after they got from under their task Masters after God had delivered them it wasn't long before now they don't want hey we what happened to this man Moses we'll make this golden calf wasn't long before they they they uh div it away from from that cry that stir that they once had they wanted God to do something in their life wasn't long before they got away from that cry why because they the Taskmaster things look like it l up right been a little easy in their life so it wasn't long before get away from that and they already ready to forsake the one that brought them out y'all believe that tonight but I says what is it what it is we always we always want to stay in in Revival mode in your spirit you always want to stay within yourself or or refreshing that's what that's I you know we sing that song sometime Lord take me back to where I first believe because you want to stay in that refreshing mode I don't know about you but always to that place you always want to see God like that like we singing a little song Lord do something new you always want to see God do something new in your life you always want to see God move again in your life and then when you feel you know sometimes that you're a little stalemate or or things look like they creeping in you get somewhere in isolation with God and you say Lord people might say oh you all right God is blessing you move but within yourself you feel like you need something something more from God no matter how much men are telling you everything is all right you within your in your in your spirit and your inner man you longing saying God I need more of you come on it's not that man can tell you you all right every day but what is the inner man telling you come on all these voices can say everything is all right but what is the inner man what is the teacher what is he telling you what is that is that thirst do you still have that emptiness that that something you know that you need to be quenched and don't and sometimes we'll ride it on out ride it on out but I says you know God God he's the Fountain of Living Waters y'all believe that tonight I was preaching last week I said I know a little bit about running water now brother Gerald since happened last week but I says what it is he's that Fountain ain't he come on he's that Fountain of Living Waters I I know I know one thing you know one thing about God he he never ever it's never been a trial that God wasen able to right to handle I was laying in the bed today I said you know it's nothing that God God is the champion of everything things come up and what it is he's a Fountain of Living Water he's a well that'll never run dry come on he says you come to drink of the draw of this well he says and you going to thirst again but the water I give you he said it'll be like a whale springing up in you I've experienced that Christ is that well that never runs dry come on it's not that you come to God and like some people say I say oh he coming back again what you need now come on but God said I'll Supply your needs according to his riches and Glory come on he's that well he's that Fountain of Living Water that well that'll never run dry anything you need all you have need of and all he is the place where you can go and draw from and it never you can't stop I was thinking that you can't stop God you can't you can't beat god- giving you can't beat God blessing you can't stop him you can't tell him what to do or what not to do right but the thing about it is one thing about God he's going to keep his word no matter what because he is the word he can't change he can't he says God is not a man I'm not a man he's he's not going to lie to you right so what it is when when you have needs need of healing I like how here in Jeremiah he was saying I'm going to bring the health and the Cure come on I'm going to heal you and I'm going to bring the cure to all your diseases come on but I want you to turn to me You' forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters haven't God blessed you haven't God brought you haven't God delivered you haven't God provided all your needs having God made a way come on but when things seem to be good we forsake Him sometime don't we and he says they Hune out themselves sists he says and broken sists now we know what a sister is it's a handmade ain't it like a tank or something that you know they put water in you know I was thinking about back in the in the in the days my dad was telling us cuz we raised in a house with a tin roof on it and I was thinking about uh back in the days and my dad was telling us about some of the people would knock the the water out the house in the buckets and stuff ball it drank it you know whatever but I was just thinking about you know when you comparing how sometimes people had used to have to strap for water scrap for this but yet God is the Fountain of Living Waters he's that he's that well like we say that River that's going to keep on running you can't stop it you can try to Dam it up and all that that but it's going to find a way to flow over to burst to get in every crack every crevice anywhere where it can find its way in that water is going to run in you can't stop it so I says the what it is you compare when you compare the two right the living water versus the the broken sister or the stagnated water when you compare the two there is no comparison sometimes you think why people in their minds when you compare what godh has to offer versus what the what the enemy has to offer there's no comparison is it but the minds of people I says what it is the Devil Makes what he has must be so appealing right that is way more appealing to the world than what God has to offer you but you know you know a lot of times like it says U when we beheld him there's no beauty that we shall desire him right there no Beauty and God didn't look like much of nothing did it come on he didn't look like much of nothing but he was a king of kings and the Lord of lords wasn't he he was standing there you know uh uh and they was uh uh before pilot that day maybe and had to read on his head blood coming down hair on his face beat all night look like look like much of nothing did he but then you can go into King's palaces you can see Kai and all those look like they were great men and somebody but Jesus didn't look like nothing but he was the Fountain of Living Waters what you were looking at was The Giver of Life wasn't you what you were looking at was the only one worthy to die for our sins what you were looking at was the only one that could pay for you and I right all of the the we were born in in sin we came in the world in bad shape and on top of that we still offended God often when he called us and we turned that death fear didn't we and all of our sin and all of our transgressions he didn't look like much but all the money that the world has to offer couldn't have paid your debt y'all believe it all the friends all the people that could stand up and talk for you couldn't have paid your debt come on couldn't have bought your way in glory it was only one that could have did that and he didn't look like much he didn't look like nothing but he was the Fountain of Living Waters Hallelujah he was the he was the The Giver like he was the King of Kings you can't you can't it ain't enough names that we can call him to to exalt him how high he is y'all believe it Hallelujah then you want to take other names and exalt them other people exalt them and make them walk around like they somebody come on but when you think about Jesus the lowly one the meek one ain't had H know couldn't even maybe afford a pair of shoes sometime the the birds have Nest come on everything got place in life but God didn't have place to lay his head did he come on but yet he was the maker of it all wasn't he Hallelujah come on but what it is I said the enemy makes himself a lot of times more way more appealing I think about it but I say it's what it is you know you know the people they have forsaken the Fountain of Living Waters and human themselves out sisters they always did that always made and what it is we was calling it a tradeoff is what it is come on we always say there's only two powers in the world out of all the kingdoms all there only two powers and that's God and Satan and Satan don't really have no power up other than what you give him over your life because when Jesus rose he said all power ain't that what he said is given unto me in heaven and Earth the devil don't have no power over you than what you give him through unbelief right cuz what is say sin is unbelief ain't it come on that's what it is you know uh I was ministering once on what God allows I said the thing is the devil don't got no power on you but if God whatever happened if God allowed it come on then God God's got a purpose in it but the devil you can't give the devil that power over you am even Jesus standing before pilot he says don't you know I got the power power to have you crucified or set free but he had to he had to straighten them out didn't he he said you wouldn't have no power over me except it been given to you my from my Father which is in heaven other than that you ain't got no power over me let me let me straighten that out you don't got no power over me and you and I being Sons and Daughters of God Christ when he's risen come on all that was in God he poured in Christ all that was in Christ he poured in the church the devil don't got no power over you God has taking us through tests and trials to build our character Hallelujah but other than that the power belongs to God right and he says to many that believe to them gave he power to become what the sons of God the devil ain't got no power over you except for what you give him Hallelujah you can speak the power and give it to him right oh the devil just Dev yeah he got me what you did you spoke it and gave it to him other than that come on God is taking me through something don't worry about it come on and I Ain going to give the devil no glory in it God going to get all the glory come on cuz no matter what you know he say oh Joseph we we we sorry we did like he said uhuh come on he says God did it didn't he God sent me down here you didn't do that God did this God did it because he already knew that what was going to take place and that many people can be save today you didn't do it God Did It Right can't give the enemy no kind of credit no kind of glory god God Did It things that in your life I look at it as as I sharing brother Gordon tonight I said we going to you got to live one day at a time right one day at a time just praise God thank God for everything you going because one day at a time because you know that he's got his hands on you you know that this situation is under control because God's got you come on God's got you I believe it brother well calling a brother friend of mine at work he was saying Earnest he said I I had a he said I got me a he say he bought me one he didn't give it to me yet a hoodie that's got on the back God's got me and he said his sister is picking at him a little offended not offended but picking at him says cuz he wearing this big sweater on the back that say God got me he said he walked to the to the mailbox and they had a a a big check in there he opened the check up he told his sister said see God got me come on he said now she want to wear one of them sweaters cuz every everybody that read that on the back of your sweater say God got him come on cuz you you say God got me he got you don't he come on he won't I like that little song He said Jesus said if you lean on me come on I won't let you fall if you lean on me you know a lot of time we stumbling but he won't let you fall Willie seen that little baby the other night at the little program I kept saying oh every time I thought your little one maybe just learning how to walk but she kept stumbling and falling back and and then one time I think she was doing it on purpose cuz every time she fall back she knew that Mama was going to catch you I was scared I said up up like that then Mama reached out there and grab but the baby was doing that why because she knew that Mama was going to let her fall now come on but what I say is with us now we don't tempt God and by no means right but we ain't afraid of falling why because God got us hallelujah I was saying you know one thing about it I was telling people today I said you know I'm not I don't get intimidated by people people you know I don't get I said the people walk in this plan I don't get intimidated by them I said they might be more skilled and might more no know more than you and all that but that don't intimidate me why because I ain't even trusting in My Own Strength myself I ain't even I ain't even trusting in my own knowledge and my own ability in myself I got an understanding that all this come from God come on just in a moment God can take your memory take your mind take all those things and you can't even troubles shho or do none of that so all the glory belongs to Who belongs to God don't it so why should I be intimidated long as when I wake up in the morning come on God is still holding my hand I ain't worried about it Hallelujah long as when I lay down at night God is still holding my hand I ain't worried about it come on when I go down in the grave if God's still in me I ain't worried about it Hallelujah that make you feel good don't it hallelujah oh oh Jesus God got you tonight we all all get some sweaters that say God got us because it's the truth ain't it come on we got to think that way y'all believe that tonight he's the Fountain of Living Waters you got to think that way nothing can't stop that up you try to stop it up it'll rupture won't it come on it'll find like I say some crack where to get out you can't stop it up it's going to flow ain't it and that's what it is God if you can use anything Lord you can use me come on he says it says stop them uh the people they saying hosan stop them he said if they stop the Rocks should cry out won't they come on God can use what he want can he but my thing is he is the Fountain of Living Waters it's a tradeoff don't trade him off for nothing it ain't worth it is it I was thinking about that in the in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve right I says they were sitting there at a tree of life right we know we can go into teaching and all but let's just talk about tonight the tree of life right the the tree of knowledge good and evil you know the Bible says Eve saw that it was good for for the pleasant to the eyes and good for food right it was pleasant uh uh listen look at that part all the time it was pleasant to the eyes it had to be more appealing didn't it than the tree of life had to be by subtility we know the serpent begal Eve and all that but the Bible says she saw come on her eyes messed her up didn't it come on her own eyes blinded her to the truth didn't it come on cuz she thought for sure well she know Adam know the woman was in transgression but Adam know what he was doing right come on but it had to be look so good to it was deceptive right come on I said don't let nothing deceive you tonight don't let nothing take you off of that stand that you that promise that you made with God don't let nothing take you off of that don't let no trial no nothing come in your way that's going to take you off of that stand that you made with God am I thought about some things some testimonies this talking the other day I said you know I saying uh guys at work there's only two of us in the maintenance department that don't drink out of all the people right so it's talking and I said the thing is I says you know and I I said it many times you know trials and things and all kind of situations come up in your life and the enemy put things in your mind but it's one thing about it God's Got got me right what I don't care how ping or how good the enemy might make it sound I know that what I've got is living I know that what I've got is life and I can't trade it off Hallelujah my desire is only for him and what he has Hallelujah though he take me through mountains though he take me through valleys though he take me through hardship and trials though I have to pass by that way come on the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green PES he restoreth my soul come on he leadth me beside the righteous for his name's sake Hallelujah though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I won't fear no evil I know I'm messing it up but y'all know what I'm talking about Psalm 23 come on but what it is though I go through all those things I said I found something greater than that in my time of trouble TR alcohol can't pull me out of it come on in my time of trouble drugs can't pull you out of it a woman or a man can't pull you out of it but I know one in my time of trouble in my time of depression in my time of pain sorrow whatever came my way Hallelujah the word found a way to pull me out of it yes it did found way hallelujah oh I oh God something might to be bubbling in your soul that Living Water brother brother Fred that Living Water ought to be bubbling in your soul something always well I say something but the word always found a way to pull you out of it I love that that's always says that a lot of times when I was faced with trials or situations or didn't know how to handle situations you go into prayer a whole lot but God always would answer it'll be a scripture come alive somewh the word will come and in that scripture when you hear it or when you read it it becomes life to you you read it you quoted it many times but now in this time the Holy Ghost brought it back to your remembrance come on and it's a Well springing up on the inside of you it was there the whole time but now it's springing up come on in the time that you needed and it brought you up out of that place you were at people say what happened the word got hold to me hallelujah what happened the word changed my life Hallelujah and it's changing me from day to day is it changing you tonight come on but he says they they they've committed two evils against me come on they forsaken me God God never forsakes you but we forsake Him they forsaken me come on all that and and Jeremiah crying out to them all they was trying to get them to do to repent turn back to me turn back to me get those Idols away from you put those Idols out the camp get get back come on worshiping those other gods get back he says I told y'all to you to do this to the stranger take them in all that you've done the opposite you're doing the opposite he said get it out put it away from you turn back to me come on he said and I I'll bless you he says but if you don't the Babylonians coming come on and then it came to the place to where the he cried out so much and you know I was thinking about that he was crying out and God told him to put a a wooden Yol around your neck go stand in there and tell them I'm you with these you going to be carried away into Babylon but then you had a and they knew the Babylonians was eating up the countries around them come on and they were coming for Jerusalem but here it is I believe hananiah one of those took the sword and broke it off Jeremiah neck with this prophesying come on prophesied a lie though didn't he and the people sided with a false prophecy rather than the word of the Lord why because the word of the Lord was calling them back to repentance people don't want to repent do they people don't want to know want to admit that they wrong admit when they exposed to where they are in God they don't want to admit Lord I'm sorry God you exposed me help me to get back they don't want to get back but he on my man you all right everything is all right God is with you and God ain't among you come on you know you think about Samson all the time he was down there up there playing with the laa but the Bible says men was lying and weight in the chamber to bind him whole time he playing with dalila come on first a couple times playing around but it came that time he said I'll shake myself as other times but he didn't know that God wasn't with him went out there didn't he come on but I said tonight don't don't forsake the Fountain of Living Waters come on as I was I've been saying this for the last several weeks cuz been looking over some things and you know where God brought us from and I one of my one of my classmates got hired on a job with us it's a small world real small world but he got hired on the job with us and and I pull a phone out my pocket it's a old picture with us on when we was growing up in the neighborhood and he's like man you just brought back so many memories so we just talking and just talking about you know how many of them dead and gone how many of them had hard lives how many of them in jail and all those things and and I say you know see what happened to me God I was one of the called out ones he's like Ernest man you was doing stuff a lot early way and you were you know leading the pack or whatever I says but I was one of the called out ones I says when he called me it was something that I ain't know from the beginning I couldn't explain what was going going on with me everybody thought I said everybody thought I went crazy everybody thought it was just something that just going to oh it's going to pass sooner or later I said but back then it was something that got hold to me come on and I said that some of the same places I walk I carried the Bible to to talk to the boys and all that I said if if every if y'all would only knew back then how real it was if You' only knew it's still real right now but I said said if you only knew then if everybody could have just came along some of us wouldn't have had to live those hard lives some of us wouldn't have had to suffer because he was the Fountain of Living Waters he was he was going to make the way for us they say well you didn't know where you was going yourself Ernest but I know who was leading me though I didn't know the way I didn't know where I was going but I knew that the one that was calling me knew the way come on and he's still I say he's still the same he's still the same today as he was back then he's still just as real I said when you look over though you wish that that a lot of them most you wish all of them would have would have know back then what God would could have did in their life you know some of you say that Destiny and all that and that may be true but I says that I want I like to think sometime what God could have did with your life if you would only at that point let go and let God have his way you know what I was told oh you going to waste away your youth by some older people you ain't got to do all that you going to get old and you going to wish you hadn't did live that way but it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory come on I still ain't old yet I'm a little older but I still glad that I gave God my life long time ago I'm glad that I didn't seek after him but he sought after me I'm glad that he didn't wait on me to come after him but he called after me he's been drawing and pulling on me and I'm glad that I had the courage amen hallelujah and the faith to step out even in then right come on aren't you glad tonight that you're in the house of God come on because it don't stop here but it's going out throughout all eternity come on that's the thing we're not soring I I was sharing one of the guys at work I man I said you believe in God he's older in his 60s almost 70 no I don't believe in God I said what do you believe then it's going to happen he said you just go back to dust so I start talking to him I said man you know he ain't disrespectful he just don't believe in God Sayan never was raised that way so I said man good has God been to you talking to him I says the thing is cuz his wife his wife is starting to uh have some issues complications but you know all your faith is in the doctors cuz you don't believe in God but the doctors can't find nothing what's wrong he telling me what's going on and and I already know I said you see it's a demon they ain't going to be able to see that on X-rays and all that stuff right but you know you don't believe in God but I says what happens is I ain't going to say what happens is but I look at that and I says I see the scriptures say we don't sorrow as those that don't have no hope cuz in this life we we know we just passing through God is blessing us and we you know living this life and enjoying the Lord while we here but this ain't we in that we're looking for the Hereafter we're striving with all our hearts one day at a time asking God thanking God for keeping us one more day thanking God for holding on to us one more day thanking God because when it's when it's all over we know that we'll wear a crown when it's all over when you when you're dead you're not done but when we have to come God we already know that he already judging us now come on that when we come before him we can be blameless washed in the blood of the Lamb y'all believe that tonight but you know I says we don't sorrow as those that don't have hope but we've got hope right when they say it's over with we got hope don't we when you close your eyes we got hope do you have that hope tonight God is good let us bow Jesus the Fountain of Living Waters I said God wants you to drink tonight how many want to drink of that Fountain how many want to dip of that well that never runs dry even if you are already dipped how many say Lord I want more of it God I want more fill my cup Lord let it run over that I won't thirst no more let it be that well Lord springing up on the inside inside of me is that what you want tonight well God want to give it to you right now said I've already tasted but I need another drink God got enough for everybody come on he said whosoever will let him come God got enough you can drink from the Waters of Life freely you can get quench come on
