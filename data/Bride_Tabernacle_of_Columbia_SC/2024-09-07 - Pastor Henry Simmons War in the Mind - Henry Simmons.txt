Afflicted now in Jesus name will you bless your word tonight meet the needs of your children in Jesus name amen the book of uh Romans 8 we speaking last night on speak your mind tell me what's on your mind yes what's in your heart am amen so we want to talk about the wall that's going on now not over there that over across the water in Israel and Ukraine but the wall that's going on within your mind amen the wall of the mind it says Romans 8 and5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be caral minded is what but to be spiritual minded is what life because the caral mind is imity against God it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be so then they that are in the flesh cannot what please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is what and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is alive because of righteousness but if the spirit that raises up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also what Qui your moral Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwells in you amen therefore brethren we are dors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall what die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall what for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are Son of God God bless the re word you may be seated so by the grace of God glad to see s Patricia and brother Fred back amen God is good amen we're in a war we're in a battle whether you want to fight it or not you amen you still everyone in here whether you like it or not you're in a war amen and the wall is going on we talking uh the other day about uh mind battles and the control tower and all of that and the Battleground and how the greatest battle ever fought is fought in your mind ain't that right so we have a battle going on and who's going to get control of this mind and who's in control of your mind amen sometimes people think that I'm just going to you know just going to be blanked in the mind but there's a walk going going on Amen the devil will have you think that you can just set aside and amen but the the Mind amen is going to be bombarded with thoughts that's right and we understand that in the days of Noah every imagination thought of men Hearts were continually evil amen so the mind is being bombarded with thoughts amen some are from above and some is from beneath amen the devil amen amen Satan and God Amen is battling amen who's going to control you amen all the Demons of Hell amen is bombarding amen and we know that those angels I mean those unclean spirits let loose out of Euphrates coming against the bride isn't that right so you have thousands of demons may be in this room but you have the angels of God and Camp right about you isin't that right so by the grace of God uh the W that's going on the battle that's going on what you going to do about it sit down and you say they're dropping bombs everywhere but I'm just going to sit down I'm passive see people don't get engaged you got to get engaged you got to know that if if I don't fight amen the devil is going to destroy my life but am I going to set still and allow the devil to destroy my life or am I going to fight there's a war going on when you see amen uh one uh a country are coming against another and they are maybe dropping bombs and maybe they trying to amen control or take over the the country then the other one begin to come back amen come back that so we understand Through the Ages amen that the enemy comes riding a white horse amen then God sent out the lion anointing to come back amen so as it was throughout the church ages so it is throughout our lives amen amen when uh amen the red horse rider rides amen God sends out an ARX anointing are you with me does anointings come to come back the devil when the enemy come in like the flood the spirit of the Lord lift up a standard against the devil so we're in a w don't mean nothing to those that am me the devil got control of Amen the word don't mean a thing to those that the devil got control of matter of fact they ain't even interested all they weren interested in is what the devil trying to tell to them they don't even want to hear the word they don't need it because they got their God Jesus are you with me so you have some that's in here now that don't mind nothing amen hey we don't want to hear nothing you got to say because we're listening to the one that's got control over our lives jus Jesus amen but I want you to know you got to pay attention amen and to what is going on with your life because you can end up in a a in a terrible situation in a terrible State thinking that hey I ain't got to hear this but you better take heed oh Lord because the Battle Ground what the devil want control of is your mind and perhaps he's already taken captive he's already controlling your mind and you are allowing it and won't do nothing about it thank sometimes you can tell by people demeanor how they respond to the word how they look you can tell what spirit is controlling them because they don't care for the things of God Jesus bless amen but when it comes to the pleasure and the things of the world Amen they all happy and smiling because why they care for the things of the word are car minded is imity against God and is not subject to the laws of God and neither indeed can it be but the spiritual mind amen is life amen amen those that want the spirit of God they want Amen Let me just pick back up here he says in the beginning of here uh uh Romans 8:1 it says there is therefore now no condemnation Amen to them that are what in Christ the in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life amen has made me free from the law of sin and death amen so somebody amen said Paul says we die daily and reckon yourself to be dead so Hallelujah reckon yourselves to be dead to sin so if you're dead amen then we realize uh uh amen that once one is dead then he says modify the Deeds of the body let it rotten amen and you shall live mortified get rid of it amen he said if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above amen let's look at Colossians 1 now I I got to move on pretty quick but by the grace of God Colossians 1 I wasn't long last night but you got a mortify those things which are uh upon the Earth amen the car of mind if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ set it on the right hand of God set your affections on what things above and not on what Colossians 3 and it say not on the things of the Earth for ye are what 3 and three for you are dead and your life is what Colossians 3 your life is here with Christ in God he said for you are dead are you dead are you really dead say ye are dead you said well I I don't understand how am I be a dead dead to sin sin has no more dominion as Romans say sin does not have any dominion over you are you with me when Adam Sinn and Eve Sin Sin amen had dominion over when when Christ died for our sin amen and we were buried with him in baptism we Rose to walk in newness of life amen sin does not have any dominion over you the devil does not control you anymore amen one writer said we're carrying a dead body around amen praise God we are carrying a This Old Man is dead is been crucified with Christ amen it said nevertheless I live but yet not I live but Christ live carrying this old dead man around and you can see it amen it's a dead man amen hallelujah but amen the new man is inside of a dead body are you with me amen this old adamic man this uh came from sin after the first Adam amen he had to die that Christ might live are you with me so the life amen that's in the inside amen he said I want you to reckon yourself to be dead but alive unto righteousness Amen Let Christ rule in you am the battle is whether or not I'm going to do it or not the world is going on whether not I'm going to let Christ amen rule my life or whether not I'm going to let these are vain imaginations Jesus Jesus these thoughts and inclinations that coming from beneath am I'm going to let these evil thoughts these bad thoughts of all kind of worldly ungodly unclean thoughts am I going to let them Ruess thank you Jesus am I going to fight and cast down amen do you want to cast down imagination true amen so he he he talks about the weapon of our Warfare are not con amen amen but they're Mighty to God Amen you can't let this uh you can't let the devil win the battle devil you not going to win am devil you not going to win the battle I'm going to fight for my right amen you're not going to win hallelujah hallelujah but somebody just sitting around this don't play play when when you come here amen judgment begins in the house of God and the first beginning us well shall the sin and ungodly appear amen I'm going say that the righteous scarcely be save are you with me we we hear amen God has given you Victory but you don't if you don't take advantage of what he done for you when he died on that cross for your sins and it wants to give you eternal life but if you turn it down you say well I don't want it why you don't don't want it cuz the devil offering you something that you think that's better Hallelujah the battle is going on the greatest battle ever fought for in your mind the devil tell you you're sick when you God say you heal but that's a battle that you got to fight am I going to believe what God Said with the stripes I'm heal I'm going to believe what the devil said I'm sick bless bless I said I'm Healed heal in Jesus name Hallelujah you got to fight what you feel you got to fight what you think and you got to lay hold on what God Said in his word amen you can't lose because the word of God is right it's powerful Hallelujah in the word of God I got a hiding place amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus I tell you you can't let the devil do you any kind of way and get by with it he said for the for though we walk in the flesh we do not walk after the flesh that's 2 Corinthians 10:4 he said for the weapons of our Warfare are not Conor to be con minded is death I'm G tell you something how can we just come to church and a don't even be don't I uh we just not in it you can reach all you want you can say what you want people just not in it oh how many people not in it when is that's going to be somebody says Lord feed me Jesus feed me till I want no more feed me your word God I need it I need Deliverance Lord I need help I'm not going to be hell caped by the devil amen praise God hallelujah I may not be I might be tired I might be War but I want your word God God I need your word I need Deliverance Lord I need help God lord GL lord it's hard to feed somebody that's full and when people get full of the devil you can't give them nothing cuz they full Jesus I ain't say y'all full of the y'all don't take it that way but if people were full you can't give them nothing amen but it's it's something about the illumination of the Holy Ghost how the Holy Ghost begin to light on you and illuminate your life once you begin to feed on the word that's right the word if the word don't have interest the interest of that word give it light are you with me if the word don't have a a a where it can penetrate where it can come into your heart if the word is not received it reflects back amen are you with me if the word cannot find a resting place remember the Holy Ghost is like a dove and it won't not a wolf it can't light on a wolf if you got a wolf spirit then when the when the word goes out it cannot light because a wolf or what away if a d come near a wolf what the wolf going to do eat it eat it up you going to devile it so the dove know the stay away from the wolf ain't that right but we need a a lamb he said behold the what Lamb of God that take away the sin of the world so our nature got to be amen our hearts got to be uh right where the word can fall on good ground isn't that right and and the word can penetrate amen find a resting place you know what God is only going to give you amen what you you begin to pull on it and say Lord I I need something from you God speak to my heart God I need amen a word from you I need Deliverance Lord I need help how can God help somebody that don't want no help how can God heal somebody that don't want to be healed how can God save somebody that don't want to be saved how can God bless somebody that say I'm off I don't need it um you know it's so much that's available for us right now and God wants to feed us and God wants to bless us but you know until we start you know our mind the mind the Mind amen amen as a man think it in his heart so is he who's controlling thank you Jesus have you thought about it amen I don't want to holl have you thought about who's controlling your mind or do you believe that hey I'm in my right mind I was thinking real hard about how many people have sound Minds y'all see what happened down to the schoolhouse the other day and what's wrong with the daddy that bought the boy that gone amen how many have sound Minds sometimes you you look for the parent or the ad to have a sound mind but something wrong amen sound Minds the war that's going on in our mind sober mind sound mind all going on in the mind people ain't so minded I said the people something wrong with people that get these children uh cell phones and they they ain't 2 years old one year old and and they they playing game something wrong people have lost Shake somebody hand say people have lost y'all say what they lost amen who got it if they lost it where is it you know I I remember going to a church back in the dirt road back in Mullins and I went in that church and so uh ladies was in there and they were just shower and they was going around and had a big old Bass from that's only kind of music had and they was my mind my mind it gone my mind I said oh look Holy Ghost got my mind Ain gone I said I never could forget that son that that s they had that big Bas room and they was beating it and it said my mind my mind is gone the Holy Ghost got my mind and gone amen and I I said I I can't forget it my mind is gone the Holy Ghost got my mind and gone so my mind my mind is gone see people have say it again people have lost their minds it's it's sad isn't that right the prophet of God said the whole world will be totally what insane isn't that right the whole world not just in Columbia South Carolina in the in Atlanta Georgia in that area but the whole world will be totally insane Insanity has struck the world that's right if a person stripped their clothes off you remember what happened to uh uh Nebuchadnezzar when he lost his mind his nails got real long a't that right and it began to be like a cloth and then they begin to eat grass ain't that right he begin to smoke no he to ate grass but people was smoking grass ain't that right that what we they used to call it grass what they call it now weed people smoking weed and grass but uh nezzar when he lost his mind he begin to eat grass like a like an animal ain't that right and people when they lose their mind they go to uh smoking grass are you with me and they begin to you know these long fingernails and they begin to look like claws when you lose your mind when when when Legion when they met Legion he stripped his clothes off and no man could bound them with chains and nothing when Jesus come by he said why you come to to in us before the time are you with me people strip their clothes off why it's it is certain things show you the spirit of insanity when when folks have gone insane when I worked in Max and Security in the mental institution the insane people would strip their clothes off and they almost should be almost naked and they would uh hit their heads up against the wall and all Insanity when it strikes now we got people the whole world going insane to the people that got a little bit of common decency they look like The Crazy Ones they look like the one that is gone insane the one that's trying to cover them their necklaces it look like the one that going insane remember when e Adam and Eve sin they amen they took fig leaves and they tried to cover themselves ain't that right so what happens when men go ins s when they lose their mind I'm talking about the Battle Is fault the wall is going on where in our minds so when people lose their mind they strip off their clothes what want you know I I I was out on the track yesterday and and walking and and I saw one of the most beautiful young ladies and and I said Lord have mer look what running in front of me a walk fast she had on something all the way up and I don't know why half of her backside was looking I said Lord have mercy glory to God look what we got out here and you can't turn your head to the right or left cuz it's all around the prophet said put a cross in you one you you know I don't know what you going to do turn your head where going turn it in the whole world going insane he be he be turning his head off cuz every way he turn it's going to look at look the same people have gone people ain't got no shame faceness amen they're not ashamed of the nness but when the we got to have the anointing of God to come down that conviction might come on people amen you don't have to tell them to go put on some clothes amen the Holy Ghost will bring conviction when there's enough of God in the midst amen amen when the presence of God come down amen I've seen you know young ladies you know they have a little mini and you get around you you talking you a you ain't got to be talking about the Lord they just go to pulling down and they ain't got nothing to pull they can't pull it are you with me because Ain no it ain't halfway are you with me they come under conviction you might not even be talking about the lord it's just a presence that you carry when you got the Holy Ghost you got a holy presence true amen amen and the people amen that is insan the spirit that has gotten them amen that of mind is death but people amen are are trying to conform look look what he said it said in in um Romans 12 said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God I I I meant to say the W going on y'all don't turn to Romans 12 yet cuz I'm I got to read this verse first he said and 5 10 and 5 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imagination in every High thing that exalt itself amen praise God you got to pull down strongholds amen casting down imagination and every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God bringing in the Captivity every what thought every thought into The Obedience of Christ amen see the thoughts that causes people to do certain things that it it's a thought amen before it becomes a word it's a thought amen and then that thought begin to make you imagine this is how Beyonce look and she look good but you didn't know Beyonce has got a spirit of insanity amen amen and she been anointed from demons amen amen you said don't say so but those demons that anoint you begin to entice you and begin to control your life but amen if anybody say something about it they're insane because everybody's doing it don't mean it's right the word of God Is Right amen amen but people want to be anointed to look like the word act like the world to be Amen in The In Crowd amen the majority don't win amen amen it's the one that keeps the word of God hallelujah this the battle that you're fighting the war that's going on you got to keep the word of God am CU he said if you love me keep my Commandments oh yes yes yes he said they would be turned over because they did not LA to retain God in their knowledge for this cause God to give them over to reprobate Minds amen the reprobation the wall that's going on in the mind people have become reprobated in mind they don't want God because when they knew God they glorified him not as God but became vain in the imagination and their foolish Hearts were darkened amen are you with me I said people amen done gone into that dark world Amen and they actually fellowshipping with devils and demons they come amen that they can look at amen those uh demon um pictures and go to the movie and look at them hey and it don't even make them scared folk you just see a mommy back in my everybody in the movie now they see all kind of hideous creatures that they done got out of the pits of hell and they put it on the screen and vus said that n just no bless are you with me amen and the young lady fallen in love with a demon and he become a prince see had to kiss the demon are you with me so people falling in love with devils are you with me and and Hollywood and the world is trying to get you ready for the pits of Hell amen God trying to get the people ready to go to heaven Hollywood trying to get the people ready for hell am amen but it ain't going to be nothing that you going to sit back and high the Bible said that be welling the nashing of teeth the fire going to be so hot are you with me it ain't going to be fall and then you might look at it now but the demons say ha they going to have the last laugh because somebody been anointed by the devil to show you those hideous creatures that's that's right amen hallelujah and they made a movie of what they experienced my cousin was the artist and he bowed demons sometime and he could draw those Spirits he told me he said he said bro I seen these hideous creatures these toen and demons and he could draw them but he knew they were demons now they he Heroes the the heroes and stuff they make them you know you have a Superman and Batman they got all kind of demons of this and demons of that Superstar superhero they was it was all they was all right back then but n in took it to another level they they they're trying to Captivate your mind get you ready and everything that's coming out is getting you ready to go into that dark world so the the the the dark world has invaded Satan has invaded the church Satan has invaded the school Satan has invaded the minds of the young people so so you're getting amen when when when the devil has taken over and control amen people are out of control amen because the devil done took over their mind that means they don't have control of their minds anymore they don't have no control of themselves so when they do things they're not doing it because they want to do they have lost control amen amen are you with me don't you believe it for one moment the devil amen want to take over and he wants to control your mind that you in control you're not in control no more are you with me so you're doing things that you don't want to do but you
