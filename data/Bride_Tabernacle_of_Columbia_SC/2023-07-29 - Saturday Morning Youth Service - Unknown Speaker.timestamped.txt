[1:02:43] down there I wake up Saturday morning
[1:02:45] and my left eye I couldn't I couldn't
[1:02:48] barely see on my left eye it looks like
[1:02:49] a barely I'm just like
[1:02:50] it's nothing I mean it is what it is you
[1:02:52] know I'm young I gotta worry about I
[1:02:54] ain't got to worry about nothing ain't
[1:02:56] no but ain't nothing and uh as the day
[1:02:59] went on by my eye just started hurting
[1:03:01] like more and more and more
[1:03:03] and by the time we finally got done with
[1:03:05] everything and made it back to Columbia
[1:03:07] on Saturday night
[1:03:08] my vision was completely gone on my left
[1:03:10] eye
[1:03:11] I couldn't see and I'm just like all
[1:03:14] right maybe this might be something a
[1:03:16] little serious cuz that's not normal and
[1:03:20] uh go to my text my mom and tell her uh
[1:03:22] whatever said Sunday morning I said yeah
[1:03:25] I can't I can't see anything on my left
[1:03:26] eye we might need to go to the hospital
[1:03:29] and yeah that's a picture of me in the
[1:03:32] hospital
[1:03:32] uh so we went to a first hospital first
[1:03:36] and they like I'm still thinking this
[1:03:38] ain't nothing you know they gonna give
[1:03:40] me some medicine I'll be good by Monday
[1:03:41] so he goes to the first hospital the
[1:03:43] first hospital like
[1:03:45] oh there's something more serious than
[1:03:47] what we can do here and I'm like
[1:03:49] oh okay and I'm kind of getting like a
[1:03:52] little and down I'm like you know this
[1:03:54] might be a little bit more serious and
[1:03:56] we finally went to another hospital we
[1:03:58] sitting in the room
[1:03:59] the it's one doctor come in I'm like
[1:04:02] okay the first doctor gonna figure it
[1:04:03] out we good we going
[1:04:05] first daughter came in
[1:04:07] didn't know what was going on
[1:04:09] they sent another daughter in he came in
[1:04:11] didn't know what's going on and then
[1:04:14] they see the third doctor and he she
[1:04:16] didn't even know what's going on so I'm
[1:04:17] like
[1:04:18] I'm like oh this is this is serious
[1:04:21] and uh
[1:04:22] um
[1:04:23] finally the daughter come in and tell us
[1:04:25] well we're gonna have to have you stay
[1:04:27] overnight uh well one night ain't that
[1:04:29] bad I mean that's that's cool but all I
[1:04:33] mean
[1:04:33] what after the first night we'd had the
[1:04:36] uh what the neuro
[1:04:38] neuro uh
[1:04:40] neurosurgeon uh come in the room and he
[1:04:43] came in he's checking me out looking at
[1:04:45] mine and everything and I'm like it's a
[1:04:47] new real surgeon he can tell me what it
[1:04:49] is right off the get-go we could go
[1:04:50] ahead and get him back on out of here
[1:04:52] and uh the neurosurgeon come in he's
[1:04:54] doing his test and everything and he
[1:04:56] looks at me and he said
[1:04:58] I don't know what's going on I'm like
[1:05:03] that ain't good if nobody know what's
[1:05:05] going on so now I'm like sitting in the
[1:05:07] room and I'm like
[1:05:09] I'm just like kind of I mean honestly I
[1:05:11] was kind of like I'm young I shouldn't
[1:05:13] have to deal with this like I mean I'm
[1:05:16] just it just don't make no sense and as
[1:05:18] the people kept coming in didn't know
[1:05:19] what was going on
[1:05:20] uh Pastor Simmons came in he was like I
[1:05:24] mean nobody like nobody really know
[1:05:25] what's going on so you got to have faith
[1:05:27] in like basically almost claim your own
[1:05:29] healing and just you know do it that way
[1:05:32] because I mean the daughters don't know
[1:05:33] what to do and
[1:05:35] like the doctor know what to do and
[1:05:38] don't know what else can help you but
[1:05:39] God that's the only person that can't
[1:05:41] help you at this point
[1:05:43] uh but we end up staying there for a
[1:05:46] couple of more days I just start praying
[1:05:48] every night trying to listen you know
[1:05:50] listen to the message
[1:05:51] and just
[1:05:53] try to you know really claim my healing
[1:05:56] the right way not just I'm Healed
[1:05:58] all right you're like you know you gotta
[1:06:00] you gotta claim it and uh as the days
[1:06:03] went on my vision started just like
[1:06:05] coming back you know slowly but surely
[1:06:08] and like I said that's what that was
[1:06:09] like the progress of just claiming your
[1:06:11] healing was a
[1:06:12] was it was like I don't know it was good
[1:06:15] and uh if that if that wasn't enough
[1:06:17] right there losing your vision and can't
[1:06:19] see out your eye
[1:06:21] and that wasn't enough
[1:06:22] I guess
[1:06:24] and you know I just started you know
[1:06:26] trying to follow God a little bit better
[1:06:27] and I guess the devil's just like you
[1:06:29] know what he doing too good let's knock
[1:06:30] him down again
[1:06:32] few what two months after that I'm uh me
[1:06:36] and my girlfriend was riding down to my
[1:06:37] my sister's uh birthday dinner
[1:06:40] we're riding down the highways raining
[1:06:42] outside uh we're just driving I'm like
[1:06:44] it's raining real hard I'm like I'm not
[1:06:46] gonna speed today I speak most of the
[1:06:48] time I drink on speed today it's raining
[1:06:49] outside so I slow down a little bit so
[1:06:51] I'm going a little bit below the speed
[1:06:53] limit you know just cruising and uh
[1:06:56] as we're driving it's a little Nissan
[1:06:58] Altima
[1:07:00] just comes on the right side of us and
[1:07:02] hits the back of my truck
[1:07:04] and slams the whole truck into the wall
[1:07:07] and we slam into the wall I black out on
[1:07:10] the Wheel
[1:07:12] and we spend in 360 in the highway and
[1:07:15] my girlfriend says she can see all the
[1:07:16] cars just coming towards it's almost
[1:07:19] like it was like a like a standard like
[1:07:21] right there just making sure nobody hit
[1:07:23] us and as we're going off the side of
[1:07:25] the road as I'm blacked out at the Wheel
[1:07:28] by the time I wake up if you can see in
[1:07:30] that what that third picture right there
[1:07:32] that pole if I didn't if I would have
[1:07:35] waked up a couple more seconds later
[1:07:36] that pole would have probably been in my
[1:07:38] in my head
[1:07:39] but it's just I don't know like I say
[1:07:42] it's unbelievable how you know how good
[1:07:44] God is and
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:50] and uh
[1:07:54] I mean as I seen that picture on uh
[1:07:57] Instagram the other day and basically in
[1:08:00] that whole time period I was like in
[1:08:01] between
[1:08:03] do I really want to give my all to God
[1:08:05] do I really want to step into church
[1:08:07] it's like as a you know I don't know for
[1:08:10] all young people but I know for me it
[1:08:12] was a battle because the world looked
[1:08:14] more appealing than going to church but
[1:08:16] it's like I guess God just came like
[1:08:18] they see you running to the lamb like
[1:08:20] I'm coming to get you like you ain't I
[1:08:22] ain't letting you go far and that
[1:08:24] scripture
[1:08:30] uh that's that scripture right there
[1:08:32] been on my heart it says for the son of
[1:08:35] man it's come to seek and save that
[1:08:38] which is lost
[1:08:39] which was Lawson and it's like in that
[1:08:42] time period I was just lost I didn't
[1:08:43] know
[1:08:45] I guess I didn't know like what I wanted
[1:08:47] to do and God said this is where you're
[1:08:49] gonna go and I say I ain't I ain't
[1:08:52] perfect I'm still trying to learn some
[1:08:53] things and trying to live my life in the
[1:08:55] best way possible but because they've
[1:08:56] been leaning leaning on him and just
[1:08:58] gonna keep believing and trusting in Him
[1:09:02] foreign
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:20] I'm Grace uh I'm the daughter of brother
[1:09:24] Gordon over there and my testimony
[1:09:27] starts the beginning of my senior year
[1:09:31] August 12th I collapsed down on the
[1:09:34] floor right over there and I started
[1:09:36] having a seizure
[1:09:38] I was foaming at the mouth I would
[1:09:40] violently Shake I would gasp for air and
[1:09:43] we went to the hospital
[1:09:45] it stopped on the way to the hospital
[1:09:48] and we were like
[1:09:50] maybe it's the Clorox wipes that I use
[1:09:52] maybe I got alert allergic reaction to
[1:09:54] that
[1:09:55] and was like okay just don't use them
[1:09:57] again you know I was like okay fine
[1:10:00] about two weeks later
[1:10:02] the same thing happened but it happened
[1:10:05] longer I wasn't seizing but I was going
[1:10:09] in and out I would always my eyes would
[1:10:12] roll in the back of my head I would lose
[1:10:15] my sight I could hear all the time I
[1:10:18] blacked out and I would just lay there
[1:10:21] and then come back it was like
[1:10:24] I don't know it was like I was sleeping
[1:10:25] and then waking up but I could always
[1:10:27] hear so brother Simmons had prayed for
[1:10:29] me and were and we were saying that I
[1:10:32] wouldn't go to school because we didn't
[1:10:33] know if it would happen again but School
[1:10:35] hasn't hadn't started
[1:10:37] or had it
[1:10:39] it started school started so
[1:10:42] I had the most violent one that I had
[1:10:45] was at home I woke up and I was not
[1:10:48] breathing my sister had to get Mom and
[1:10:51] Dad and help me to wake up to get up to
[1:10:55] breathe but I was shaking violently I
[1:10:57] was shaking my mother I was shaking the
[1:10:59] bed I was just trying to breathe I was
[1:11:03] trying to stop shaking it was just
[1:11:05] terrible after that we went to the neuro
[1:11:10] neurologist thank you we went to the
[1:11:13] neurologist and we did an EEG and that's
[1:11:16] when they put
[1:11:18] things on your head to see if you're
[1:11:20] having seizure
[1:11:22] signs on your brain and I was not having
[1:11:27] any shown up show up at all and we're
[1:11:30] like okay that's great so I go to the
[1:11:31] bathroom
[1:11:32] because we're about to leave and as I'm
[1:11:34] washing my hands you know my mother's
[1:11:36] outside waiting for me and I opened I
[1:11:39] don't know if I opened the door but I
[1:11:41] think my mother opened the door I opened
[1:11:42] the door and mom was like Grace you
[1:11:44] ready to go I looked at her and I
[1:11:47] realized I was not moving but in my mind
[1:11:49] I thought I was
[1:11:51] and then I fell
[1:11:53] uh thank God there was a doctor there
[1:11:55] who was able to see this because you
[1:11:57] wouldn't believe us because the test
[1:11:58] wasn't showing that it was happening so
[1:12:01] a doctor was there they got me in the
[1:12:03] they got me admitted to the hospital
[1:12:04] right next door and I had another EEG
[1:12:07] when I woke up
[1:12:09] I could talk to you
[1:12:11] but I'd pass out and still be in the
[1:12:13] conversation
[1:12:15] I would pass out and I would answer the
[1:12:17] doctors came they saw how it was
[1:12:19] happening and they told me that it was
[1:12:21] stress
[1:12:24] from being a senior
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:28] I had only been a senior for two weeks
[1:12:31] and I wasn't even in the classroom
[1:12:34] yeah so um
[1:12:38] we did not believe it I can't remember
[1:12:40] the term right now
[1:12:43] uh but it was
[1:12:46] something disorder
[1:12:48] and mom didn't believe it because they
[1:12:50] had given mom a paper and on the paper
[1:12:52] they were saying if she has another
[1:12:54] episode don't let her do something
[1:12:56] because it's out of um
[1:12:59] it's out of spite for what she wants
[1:13:01] like basically punish her because this
[1:13:04] is stress and she's just doing this for
[1:13:06] attention
[1:13:08] and we did not like that at all so I
[1:13:11] went home and I started to have it again
[1:13:15] and we went to the um
[1:13:18] MUSC a hospital in Charlotte and it this
[1:13:22] was a movie scene because I could not
[1:13:24] get up oh sorry before that I was
[1:13:27] passing out and my brother took me
[1:13:29] downstairs because I couldn't walk
[1:13:31] I couldn't walk
[1:13:33] and my brother was yelling at me wake up
[1:13:36] and everything and I was just passed out
[1:13:38] pass out every position you put me in I
[1:13:41] would pass out or I couldn't breathe
[1:13:43] and for some reason I don't know but
[1:13:46] Paul had lifted my leg my older brother
[1:13:48] and I woke up and then he dropped it and
[1:13:52] I passed out
[1:13:53] and then Paul was like Mom look at this
[1:13:55] because I can hear everything now even
[1:13:57] though I'm passing out Paul lists my leg
[1:13:59] I'm awake I can see he drops it again
[1:14:02] I'm out so
[1:14:05] God bless Paul Paul did a lot for me
[1:14:08] um so for I don't know about 20 minutes
[1:14:11] he's just standing there holding my legs
[1:14:13] so I'm awake and conscious and Mom and
[1:14:17] Dad are videoing because we don't know
[1:14:19] what's going on and Mom had never seen
[1:14:21] that before
[1:14:22] so we decided to go to MUSC to see
[1:14:25] what's happening because maybe they have
[1:14:26] better doctors I can't walk and the ER
[1:14:30] is probably on the third floor
[1:14:33] so this nice man carried me all the way
[1:14:36] to the ER and I think I was passing out
[1:14:39] but he was screaming move and stuff it
[1:14:41] was like in a movie scene and then he
[1:14:43] put me on the tray that they put people
[1:14:46] in the ER in and we spent some time in
[1:14:48] the ER because the doctors were asking
[1:14:50] all the basic questions
[1:14:52] um is she up to left is she epileptic
[1:14:55] does she have any issues with her heart
[1:14:58] is she healthy is she you know is her
[1:15:01] blood sugar right and mom was telling
[1:15:03] them we don't know what's going on we
[1:15:06] already had a EEG but it shows nothing
[1:15:09] but this is still happening what do we
[1:15:12] do the doctor had to um
[1:15:15] an IV we were having troubles with the
[1:15:18] IV come in my vein because it was to
[1:15:22] uh well it wasn't working and we had to
[1:15:26] spend time on that to get the IV and
[1:15:28] draw blood and stuff and Mom had to try
[1:15:31] to do it so that was that because mom
[1:15:34] had to try to do it I was like oh no you
[1:15:37] know because mom's a nurse and when the
[1:15:39] nurse tries to take over from another
[1:15:41] nurse it's not good so we stayed there
[1:15:43] and we did another e k e g I think and
[1:15:48] this one seemed to be better because the
[1:15:50] one the guy who did it on my head said
[1:15:52] that if they didn't remove my hair
[1:15:56] um like he had they did it wrong and
[1:15:59] we're like oh okay that's great because
[1:16:01] they most definitely did it wrong
[1:16:03] because they just put it on top of my
[1:16:04] braids while he sectioned out my hair
[1:16:06] and put it on my scalp
[1:16:09] once again it showed no sign even though
[1:16:12] Mom and Dad sitting on the sitting on
[1:16:15] the side in the room and me on the bed
[1:16:17] they could see me Twitch
[1:16:19] just twitch and still sleep and that's
[1:16:22] what's been that what had happened
[1:16:24] so because of this I'm on
[1:16:28] Homebound and I can't go to school
[1:16:31] because I can't walk while I'm eating
[1:16:34] I'm passing out and people are my my
[1:16:36] family's jumping out at the table making
[1:16:39] sure I don't choke while I pass out with
[1:16:42] food on my mouth
[1:16:43] I'm drinking through a straw my brother
[1:16:46] is carrying me upstairs I can't use the
[1:16:48] bathroom by myself I can't shower by
[1:16:50] myself I was completely helpless
[1:16:53] and
[1:16:55] we're coming back from MUSC Paul takes
[1:16:58] me up the stairs and I'm in my bed and
[1:17:01] I'm thinking how in the world can this
[1:17:03] happen I was just walking how long in DC
[1:17:07] enjoying the sights in the heat with all
[1:17:10] my strength intact we went to an
[1:17:13] orchestra we walked downstairs I didn't
[1:17:15] have any of this trouble
[1:17:18] so Mom and Dad going downstairs because
[1:17:19] during this time Dad's in Florida well
[1:17:22] no Dad's here but he's working in
[1:17:24] Florida I think they're talking about
[1:17:26] that or whatever and I lay in bed and
[1:17:28] I'm looking at the TV in front of my
[1:17:29] room
[1:17:30] nothing is in my mind right now
[1:17:34] and I hear
[1:17:36] Grace you can walk
[1:17:39] and when I hear that
[1:17:42] I get up
[1:17:44] I have all strength in my legs
[1:17:48] and I walked
[1:17:57] I don't remember
[1:17:59] I I know I walked but I don't remember
[1:18:01] walking and I get to the stairs and then
[1:18:04] I remember this I say Mom Dad I'm
[1:18:07] walking
[1:18:08] and my parents run up to me and I'm
[1:18:12] crying my dad's crying my mom's crying
[1:18:15] and we're just praying and thanking God
[1:18:17] at the end of the stairs
[1:18:19] and then I pass out again
[1:18:22] so
[1:18:23] me finally hearing God's voice I'm
[1:18:26] energized I'm like we are gonna get
[1:18:28] through this
[1:18:30] during uh that was during September in
[1:18:33] October mom had found a uh
[1:18:37] neural functional neurological a
[1:18:40] neurological chiropractor in Michigan
[1:18:42] and as we talked to him we heard that he
[1:18:45] had dealt with he had seen cases like
[1:18:48] mine people are fine and then they can't
[1:18:50] control their body at all
[1:18:52] so we talked to him and we pray about it
[1:18:55] and we decide to go to Michigan
[1:18:57] and we go to Michigan and we stay there
[1:18:59] for two weeks just doing normal
[1:19:02] um all he's doing is moving my head back
[1:19:05] and forth and as he and if I try to
[1:19:09] stand up I would pass out
[1:19:11] if um he tries to move my head a little
[1:19:14] bit too fast my heartbeat would shoot up
[1:19:18] for no reason so we just stay like there
[1:19:20] for a while and when I leave
[1:19:23] when I um walk I'm walking to the right
[1:19:27] but I can still walk straight
[1:19:30] but I just keep walking to the right my
[1:19:33] body is just pushing people
[1:19:36] so when we leave God help me help my
[1:19:39] body and him to correct it So the plan
[1:19:43] is when I came home from school
[1:19:46] when I come home from Michigan I'll go
[1:19:47] to school
[1:19:48] it took time God bless Lydia because she
[1:19:52] had to roll me in a high school with so
[1:19:55] many children who apparently don't see a
[1:19:58] wheelchair
[1:19:59] one time Lydia hit this girl's ankles
[1:20:02] because we had to turn and we're like
[1:20:04] sorry but we didn't really care but
[1:20:07] um
[1:20:08] I thank God for Lydia she pushed me up
[1:20:11] she took me back to the car when I
[1:20:13] wanted to go home
[1:20:14] and I thank God for Joy for just
[1:20:16] encouraging all of us
[1:20:18] during school you don't realize
[1:20:22] that people only ask when they see
[1:20:25] something's wrong they don't truly care
[1:20:28] you know and my church family thank God
[1:20:31] for them because they always came and
[1:20:33] prayed for me and they just made me feel
[1:20:36] real welcomed and loved
[1:20:39] and this went about during all December
[1:20:42] I was in a wheelchair and then I talked
[1:20:44] to Lee I was like Lydia
[1:20:46] I'm gonna walk when Christmas break is
[1:20:48] over
[1:20:49] and Lydia said bet let's do it so
[1:20:53] we would walk in our neighborhood with
[1:20:56] the wheelchair
[1:20:58] I would walk with the wheelchair in
[1:20:59] front of me and we'd go down the street
[1:21:01] when it was too much I'd get in the
[1:21:04] wheelchair and Lydia would roll me back
[1:21:06] up we did that all during Christmas
[1:21:08] break
[1:21:09] and um
[1:21:11] sooner or later I wouldn't have the
[1:21:13] wheelchair in my hand or with me at all
[1:21:15] so Mom was like okay put the backpacks
[1:21:18] on your back because that's extra weight
[1:21:19] so we would do that we would even add
[1:21:21] more weight to make sure
[1:21:24] so
[1:21:27] even during all of this during church
[1:21:31] I would be experiencing symptoms that
[1:21:34] I've never seen my arm would flop like
[1:21:37] it was a fish out of water by itself
[1:21:40] it would just do that one time my arm
[1:21:44] should shot out and I hit my grandmother
[1:21:46] I didn't even mean to that just happened
[1:21:49] it I just did that and my leg would kick
[1:21:52] like it was a machine out of function
[1:21:55] my eyes I couldn't open my eyes by
[1:21:58] myself I would have to wait
[1:22:00] I couldn't tell them to do it apparently
[1:22:02] I had to wait on them
[1:22:04] so I had to battle with my body for some
[1:22:07] time and I thank God for healing me
[1:22:09] because
[1:22:11] um
[1:22:12] I'm standing and walking
[1:22:15] and
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:24] just yesterday I was helping carry
[1:22:26] things and you know I'm taking my time
[1:22:29] because you know I'm still recovering
[1:22:30] but God is so real
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:42] I have a picture
[1:22:44] of when me and Lydia went back to school
[1:22:46] after Christmas break
[1:22:48] and it's a picture of me and Lydia
[1:22:50] walking in school without the wheelchair
[1:22:53] and we titled the picture Victory Day
[1:22:58] because
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:05] so um I just thank God for giving me the
[1:23:08] opportunity to tell my testimony
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:26] hey man how many thank God for that
[1:23:29] make mine short and sweet
[1:23:33] a couple years ago
[1:23:36] since we've given testimonies about how
[1:23:39] God healed your body and if you heard
[1:23:41] the word last night and you received
[1:23:42] your healing just thank God for it a
[1:23:45] couple years ago um this was right
[1:23:47] before covet hit
[1:23:50] um I would have these spells in my
[1:23:52] throat where
[1:23:54] I would have a sore throat for months at
[1:23:57] a time and it's not on and off but a
[1:24:00] consistent sore throat for three four
[1:24:03] months at a time
[1:24:04] and never knew what was wrong it would
[1:24:06] go away for three days and then it'll
[1:24:08] come back and then I have it for six
[1:24:10] more months or however long
[1:24:12] and uh so I just finally was decided to
[1:24:15] go to a doctor because it just was
[1:24:16] getting unbearable
[1:24:18] and um I went to the doctor and he said
[1:24:21] well you know you never got your tonsils
[1:24:23] removed and
[1:24:24] your tonsils are very swollen and I knew
[1:24:27] I had a problem with my tonsils when I
[1:24:29] was
[1:24:30] actually in a freshman in high school
[1:24:33] my tonsil swole up to the size of a a
[1:24:36] orange and I just sat there on my neck
[1:24:39] and um but Pastor Simmons prayed for me
[1:24:43] and the Lord healed me without any
[1:24:45] surgery and all that
[1:24:47] and so
[1:24:49] it was just like brother Randy said last
[1:24:51] night the devil will come back and he'll
[1:24:53] make you believe that
[1:24:54] whatever you received you didn't receive
[1:24:58] and it don't always happen right away
[1:25:01] sometimes it may be years down the road
[1:25:03] that Satan will come and say well you
[1:25:05] know you never got healed from that
[1:25:06] thing
[1:25:07] and so I went to the doctor and he told
[1:25:10] me that you know we got to remove your
[1:25:12] tonsils and we have to remove your
[1:25:13] adenoids well like a lot of saints that
[1:25:17] go to this church my mom is a nurse and
[1:25:19] so she's like well I don't think that's
[1:25:21] a good idea you're too old for that and
[1:25:24] I said well Ma I really it's just
[1:25:26] unbearable I can't do it and young
[1:25:29] people I want to tell you if your
[1:25:31] parents tell you something
[1:25:33] listen to oh listen to him because my
[1:25:37] mom told me over and over don't get that
[1:25:39] surgery don't get that surgery
[1:25:42] and me being thinking I'm grown and I'm
[1:25:46] persistent and I'm saying I'm gonna do
[1:25:48] it anyway I'm gonna do it because I'm
[1:25:49] just tired of it I'm tired of it so I
[1:25:52] went and had the surgery which was
[1:25:54] successful
[1:25:56] but after I get out of surgery
[1:25:59] I just begin to have seizure-like
[1:26:01] symptoms and then I just die
[1:26:04] in
[1:26:06] many medical professionals in here the
[1:26:09] brain can't go without oxygen for eight
[1:26:12] minutes I was dead for about 10 to 15
[1:26:14] minutes they were taking trying to
[1:26:17] revive me and revive me and whenever
[1:26:19] they would take me back to the operating
[1:26:21] room out there would bring me back then
[1:26:24] I would go out again and they would
[1:26:25] bring me back and I'll go out again
[1:26:27] so they put me on a ventilator for three
[1:26:30] days
[1:26:31] I went into surgery on a Tuesday I
[1:26:33] didn't wake up until Friday afternoon
[1:26:36] and didn't know what was happening what
[1:26:39] transpired to nothing like that
[1:26:42] and I just went into a deep dark
[1:26:45] depression
[1:26:46] I was living with my I went and lived
[1:26:49] with my mom to recover and I just like I
[1:26:52] just want to go home I just want to go
[1:26:53] home I want to go home and again my mom
[1:26:56] said I don't think you need to go home I
[1:26:57] don't think you need to go home and
[1:27:00] I just decided to pack my stuff up and
[1:27:03] when I leave and I go home anyway
[1:27:05] and that night I just don't know what
[1:27:07] came over me
[1:27:08] but I was so depressed I was so upset
[1:27:11] because you know when you're going
[1:27:13] through problems as a young person
[1:27:14] especially it ain't just one problem
[1:27:16] that you're going through it's one two
[1:27:19] five seven I have that many problems it
[1:27:21] ain't just one and so I was just going
[1:27:23] through in my mind and I just bought a
[1:27:26] gun
[1:27:27] to to have you know protect myself
[1:27:30] and I said you know what I'm just tired
[1:27:32] of it I said I'll just become a burden
[1:27:34] of people I don't want to do it no more
[1:27:37] and I literally put my gun right here
[1:27:41] and I was about to pull the trigger and
[1:27:44] my phone went off
[1:27:47] and I knew my phone was on silent
[1:27:50] I knew I put it on silent because I knew
[1:27:52] somebody was going to call me
[1:27:54] my phone dinged and then it dinged again
[1:27:57] and it dinged again and it was a message
[1:28:00] that I you know I know we ain't supposed
[1:28:03] to have favorite preachers but I do so
[1:28:05] y'all forgive me if y'all don't
[1:28:07] one of my favorite preachers was
[1:28:09] preaching a sermon
[1:28:10] and he was preaching on
[1:28:13] having a purpose and the devil
[1:28:15] destroying it destroying your life to
[1:28:18] keep you from fulfilling that purpose
[1:28:21] and I was like I don't have no purpose
[1:28:23] you know within myself and so I was
[1:28:26] getting ready to pull the trigger and
[1:28:27] that went off and so I watched the full
[1:28:29] sermon then I began to pray and the Lord
[1:28:32] took it off of me
[1:28:34] well years down maybe a year down the
[1:28:37] road I just went to the doctor to get a
[1:28:39] physical
[1:28:41] and uh some other things done
[1:28:44] and the doctor told me he said you know
[1:28:46] son
[1:28:47] I don't know how to tell you this he
[1:28:48] said but you gotta you got a disease
[1:28:50] that you're gonna have to live with for
[1:28:52] the rest of your life
[1:28:54] and he said well you may not have
[1:28:57] children he said but you'll live a
[1:28:58] comfortable life and you'll be all right
[1:29:01] and so I went on and I believed that
[1:29:05] I believed it and
[1:29:08] that night I went to work in a brother
[1:29:11] uh clip came across my Facebook page and
[1:29:15] the brother said sometimes God puts a
[1:29:18] incurable disease on you
[1:29:20] just so he can make a miracle out of you
[1:29:26] and so from that point on
[1:29:28] I began to confess my healing like Lord
[1:29:31] you healed me Lord you said by your
[1:29:33] stripes I was healed it's already done
[1:29:36] and when I did that I just began to just
[1:29:38] keep confessing and keep festing it and
[1:29:41] it didn't happen right away
[1:29:43] I moved to uh Gastonia North Carolina
[1:29:47] and I had to get a physical done for
[1:29:49] work again and I was just dealing with
[1:29:51] some things in my body
[1:29:53] and I went to the doctor
[1:29:55] and she examined me she did and then she
[1:29:59] tested me for what I knew I already what
[1:30:01] they told me I had and so you know I was
[1:30:04] expecting
[1:30:06] to hear it
[1:30:08] but when I got my results back
[1:30:10] it was gone
[1:30:15] it was gone
[1:30:17] she called me and she said Son you got a
[1:30:19] clean bill of health
[1:30:20] and I knew and right then the Lord
[1:30:22] brought back to my remembrance I said
[1:30:24] Lord I told the Lord I promised Lord if
[1:30:25] you heal me from this I said I was serve
[1:30:28] you and I never looked back
[1:30:30] and God came back on that promise
[1:30:33] and not only did he do that
[1:30:36] but
[1:30:37] we were me and my wife we were trying to
[1:30:39] have a daughter God had promised us a
[1:30:42] daughter
[1:30:43] and we were trying to have it in in
[1:30:45] we couldn't we no matter how hard we
[1:30:48] tried we were trying we would have a
[1:30:50] negative test after negative test and
[1:30:52] miscarriages and all these things and
[1:30:54] nothing worked
[1:30:56] and so my
[1:30:59] I went to go preach a sermon down in
[1:31:02] Arkansas and
[1:31:03] this is what I believe true Ministry is
[1:31:06] when you can preach
[1:31:09] unbiasedly knowing that you're going
[1:31:10] through something where you can pour
[1:31:12] your heart out to people and know that
[1:31:14] you suffer within yourself and you don't
[1:31:16] try to cast your burdens on the people
[1:31:18] I'm preaching about speaking things into
[1:31:21] existence
[1:31:22] but I'm not speaking over my own life
[1:31:26] and sometimes that happens you speak
[1:31:28] things over other people and you serve
[1:31:30] in other people and then you lacking
[1:31:32] within your life because you don't apply
[1:31:34] the same Faith to your life
[1:31:37] and so I began to my wife thank God for
[1:31:41] her she said you know you preaching to
[1:31:43] all these other people
[1:31:45] preach to me
[1:31:47] you know how about we how about we put
[1:31:50] this stuff in action in our family you
[1:31:52] know
[1:31:53] and so after I finished preaching I
[1:31:56] didn't know the lord gave my wife three
[1:31:58] dreams you know God is perfected in
[1:32:00] threes he gave us three dreams that we
[1:32:02] were gonna have a baby
[1:32:04] and
[1:32:05] we got back and she said honey I think
[1:32:08] you need to go get a pregnancy test
[1:32:10] and I said okay you know and me being a
[1:32:13] husband and I love my wife and I don't
[1:32:15] want her to suffer because I know what
[1:32:18] she's been going through
[1:32:19] I told her I texted back I said honey I
[1:32:21] said I'll do it I said but you know if
[1:32:23] it's a bad result
[1:32:25] I want you to you know still be strong
[1:32:27] and still have faith
[1:32:30] and I don't know what changed within my
[1:32:32] wife
[1:32:33] but she said something that I think we
[1:32:35] should all tell ourselves
[1:32:38] she said honey don't worry she said I'm
[1:32:41] delayed but I'm not denied
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:48] and I know that's something we can all
[1:32:49] take for ourselves sometimes it the
[1:32:52] Bible says though it Tara wait on it you
[1:32:54] know and so she said baby I'm delayed
[1:32:57] but not denied so I'm not worried about
[1:32:58] it
[1:32:59] and so we took a test and normally it
[1:33:02] take you know three to three to five
[1:33:04] minutes for it to show up positive or
[1:33:06] something like that well we took a to
[1:33:09] decide to go a different route we took a
[1:33:10] you know regular old-fashioned test
[1:33:13] and within two seconds it was positive
[1:33:17] so of course
[1:33:19] we want to be sure and sure so we say
[1:33:22] you know what we're going to take the
[1:33:23] test that's been giving us giving us the
[1:33:25] fault the the results of negative we're
[1:33:28] going to take that test in the morning
[1:33:29] we took that test and it was positive
[1:33:32] and now we got our little baby girl
[1:33:34] sitting back there just like what she

[1:34:09] Mullins South Carolina I got my wife
[1:34:11] over here with Christian Rogers 11 years
[1:34:13] take the law off of My Wife and my two
[1:34:16] sons
[1:34:18] brother Simmons encouraging me to start
[1:34:20] telling my testimony because I had
[1:34:21] stopped because uh you know it has been
[1:34:24] some years and you know I started Living
[1:34:26] Large save me and delivered me from so
[1:34:27] much I tried to like not talk about it
[1:34:30] but the Bible tells us we overcome by
[1:34:32] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:34:34] Our Testimony
[1:34:35] but uh me and Ernest grew up in Mullins
[1:34:39] brother in this right here
[1:34:40] on small mothers who are forsake the day
[1:34:43] of the Small Things amen
[1:34:45] Mayors grew up in Mullins I grew up a
[1:34:47] straight A student
[1:34:49] I never lived with my mom or dad as far
[1:34:52] as I remember they said I was about two
[1:34:53] or three I lived with them
[1:34:55] but I don't remember living with my mom
[1:34:57] or dad
[1:34:58] I'm a family baby which my grandma's had
[1:35:01] pretty much raised me and I had a couple
[1:35:03] of aunts and uncles you know that kind
[1:35:05] of looked out for me but um I'm born and
[1:35:08] raised out of mother in South Carolina
[1:35:10] and you know I didn't really grow up in
[1:35:13] church we went to a Baptist Church and
[1:35:15] whatever Grandma wanted me to do I did
[1:35:17] you know I tried to keep my Grandma
[1:35:18] happy because I knew if it went for her
[1:35:19] I would have been in the system
[1:35:21] you know I didn't really I felt love but
[1:35:24] I didn't understand like you know seeing
[1:35:26] the people with mom and dads always
[1:35:28] wanted a family you know what I'm saying
[1:35:31] um but
[1:35:32] as I kept growing old I of course I made
[1:35:35] Straight A's in school Ernst to tell you
[1:35:37] that I was naturally smart that's
[1:35:39] god-given a blessing but I ain't really
[1:35:41] made the best decisions
[1:35:44] um I started hanking around but I didn't
[1:35:46] have a father figure so of course the
[1:35:48] men in the streets were in small mothers
[1:35:51] those were the guys that looked up to
[1:35:52] the money that the guys that had the the
[1:35:54] jewelry the money and respect in the
[1:35:56] streets
[1:35:58] um so that's all the guys that I started
[1:36:00] being around of course start
[1:36:02] experimenting with drugs
[1:36:04] um started smoking marijuana now I
[1:36:07] wanted money so I started selling drugs
[1:36:09] as well
[1:36:10] a little stuff turned to big stuff as
[1:36:12] everybody should know
[1:36:14] I haven't started started selling drugs
[1:36:16] started selling you know little stuff
[1:36:18] tennis shoe hustling is what they call
[1:36:20] it you do it just you know have some
[1:36:22] money and look good it's all perception
[1:36:26] but um as I kept doing that I ended up
[1:36:30] getting caught
[1:36:32] um like I said I ain't had my mom or dad
[1:36:34] and my dad I had to meet him until I was
[1:36:37] 16 years old
[1:36:39] good I end up getting caught and they
[1:36:41] gave me a probation
[1:36:43] they had a program I could have went
[1:36:45] through but they I wouldn't tell on
[1:36:46] nobody so they wouldn't let me go
[1:36:48] through this I think it's PTI program
[1:36:50] let me put me on probation so uh after I
[1:36:53] was on that I became a fugitive
[1:36:57] it was a fugitive for three and a half
[1:36:59] years
[1:37:01] y'all know who else was a fugitive
[1:37:04] we in the youth service I'm pretty sure
[1:37:06] your youth know who the fugitive was in
[1:37:08] the Bible
