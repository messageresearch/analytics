objection of time there are many Junctions of time that changes are made Junctions of time there are times in our lives of the individuals there are Junctions of time where changes are made in our lives are you with me so by the grace of God as the Junctions come amen that the junction came when you were in uh Elementary School and there was a time when you're moving into adolescent Teenage life that was a junction of time there were changes made in life somebody says every seven years you come to Junctions and things change and they said that you know at 40 and 40 is Judgment amen and uh the objections of time come but in our lives as we go through Junctions and different Crossroads comes in our lives decisions has to be made amen sometimes it comes to a junction of time when we want to you know go off to school and you graduate from high school when you come to a junction decisions that I make whether I go to trade whether I go to college and those objections of time those particular animals in life decisions have to be made amen sometimes we're faced with decisions that we don't want to make we want somebody to make our decisions for us but we come to a place where we have to make our own decision when it comes down to uh the junction when Christ called you to himself for salvation you have to make your own decision about it sometimes we'll we'll make decisions based on the family we'll make decisions based on friends we make decisions based on uh uh uh us a Grandmama or granddad but you got to make your decision for God on your own you got to know that God is speaking to your heart and God is calling you as an individual the Cambio church called and it's got to be an individual calling he said my sheep will hear my voice they know my voice amen when God is speaking to you amen can't no devil in hell amen stop you from coming are you a man if God said come then you're able to come no matter what the condition is amen you know that Jesus Christ died for your sin and that his blood was shedded for you and then no devil can hold you in sin if you want to receive amen what Jesus done for you amen so that Junction when you make that decision that was a junction in time there was a junction in your life that Jesus came into your life and changed your whole life amen everything changed the way you think changed the way you're walking the way your talk changed everything changed because that was a junction when Jesus saved me amen things change some folks amen they come to that Junction and they only come uh they make their minds up partially they let Jesus in partially amen it's not a total surrendering where there are major changes in life and I heard you know uh God's service talk about when when uh there are Junctions that come amen and in the days of Noah and when the days of Noah came he says uh the miraculous speaks of the omnipotent and when the omnipotent takes place amen Miracles uh vindicate the god the miraculous the Miracles take place defindicate that God I mean you'll come to that Junction it was a miracle that amen Noah was building an ark Amen on dry land people had never seen rain amen because it never rains but yet it was God speaking to Noah telling them to belong that's something when God speaks to your heart as an individual when God deals with you as an individual praise God Nobody Knows the inner voice nobody knows what amen when God Amen is able to speak to you amen maybe it's not an art of a voice but God began to deal with your ins and outs and what you going through in life and God began to talk to you and tell you it's time to make a change it's time you'll come to a junction it's time to give your heart to him it's time to give God your problems your situation your condition it's time to let God handle what you can't fix it it's time to let God fix things for you let's let God provide your every need it's time to let God take a while sometimes we have trouble on every side where we're not willing to let God happen our problems in our situations in our conditions we're not willing willing to do that but I've said if you allow him then God will back up his word with the miraculous amen praise God because you're listening to the omnipotent God the god that got all power to a god that can do exceedingly and abundantly above all that which we can actually think a God that can handle your problems a God that can stop amen every condition that you're facing if you let him Hound in in the days of Noah the people that want to believe that they have come to a time of a junction they heard no humble servant talking about rain but they didn't want to believe that I mean when you're speaking of an odd thing and it's not the common thing he was probably the only preacher was preaching what he was preaching amen that the world was getting ready to be destroyed in the world had come to an end he probably was the only one that had that voice that was speaking of such a thing and who would believe that report who would believe such a thing could happen all the scientific world and everything was the scientific world was beyond what we have now amen it probably you know you talk about the computer age and all of that the things that they did then with the pyramids and all they they haven't been able to match it yet are you up man so that age were was uh Beyond and looked like this age that we're living in yet they said it could not rain it wouldn't rain but Noah had an uncommon message speaking of something that was not really in that uh if it happened it happened it has to be a miracle there have to be something Supernatural you have to be something amen out of the ordinary brother and sister I believe because of your message you suffer you suffer because nobody want to hear your message are you a man the bible say that they that live Godly in Christ Jesus gonna suffer persecution but you find that we're living in a world where people don't want to suffer no more amen we don't want to go through it Jesus said If any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me Amen brother when you come to that Junction they make the cross don't seem too hard to Bear them amen because you're not looking at the cross you're looking at the crown amen some people look at the things that they have to go through amen they're not looking at the blessings that in store for you if you take up that cross amen God Amen has tremendous blessings amen no suffering of this present time is willing to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed oh God got so many blessings but the devil show you the suffering pod he'll show you the cross well he don't show you the victory amen praise God he don't show you how blessed you're going to be to be a Christian amen how God would bless you they may have things God will bless your family God will bless your home God will bless your children God will bless you if you let him have it with the devil alone ain't gonna show you the suffering part how you amen have to give up the world and the things of the world Amen the devil to show you all what you're missing out on but he don't show you the glory he don't show you the glory part here we are in the first second Thessalonians 5 I've been one and five I read the full verse why you turn in there so that we
