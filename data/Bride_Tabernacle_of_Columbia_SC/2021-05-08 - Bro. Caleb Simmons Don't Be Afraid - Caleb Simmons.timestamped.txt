[33:01] other side before
[33:03] unto bethsaidia while he sent away the
[33:06] people
[33:07] and when he had sent them away he
[33:09] departed into a mountain to pray
[33:11] and when even was come the ship was in
[33:14] the midst of the sea
[33:15] and he alone on the land and he saw them
[33:18] toiling and rowing for the wind was
[33:21] contrary
[33:22] unto them and about the fourth watch of
[33:25] the night
[33:26] he cometh unto them walking upon the sea
[33:29] and would have passed by them but when
[33:32] they saw him walking upon the sea
[33:34] they supposed it had been a spirit and
[33:36] cried out for they all
[33:38] saw him and were troubled and
[33:40] immediately he talked with them
[33:42] and saith unto them be of good cheer it
[33:45] is i
[33:46] be not afraid and he went up unto them
[33:49] into the ship and the wind ceased and
[33:52] they were so amazed in themselves
[33:54] beyond measure and wonder for they
[33:56] consider not the miracle of the loaves
[33:59] for their hearts were hardened amen god
[34:01] bless to read another word you may be
[34:04] seated
[34:06] amen tonight we'd like to speak on a
[34:07] little topic
[34:09] entitled don't be afraid
[34:13] don't be afraid and the book of mark
[34:16] here is
[34:16] this is a story about jesus walking on
[34:18] water and you see
[34:20] he the story goes that
[34:23] the lord was tired so he told them to
[34:25] get on the ship and he went into the
[34:27] mountain to pray
[34:29] now that's now the prophet of god he
[34:32] speaks
[34:33] in the sermon and the sermon entitled be
[34:36] not afraid
[34:37] he speaks on there and he says that the
[34:39] disciples they were
[34:41] he told them to get in the ship and they
[34:42] went to rowan and they went out there
[34:45] and everything looked calmed and
[34:46] but at the moment in time they got
[34:49] distracted
[34:50] they got distracted and they left jesus
[34:52] behind he told them to go and so they
[34:54] they didn't persuade him to come with
[34:56] him they left him behind because those
[34:58] were his words
[34:59] and he said he said that the that
[35:03] that the disciples they got distracted
[35:05] stand by they got distracted by the
[35:07] seed they got distracted by moving
[35:10] forward
[35:11] and then jesus he said said that the
[35:14] lord he got up there and even in the
[35:15] scripture says the lord he went up into
[35:17] the mountain
[35:18] to pray and sometimes
[35:21] looking at god was watching he was
[35:24] looking down
[35:25] and at the whole time while they were in
[35:27] the midst of the storm when the sea
[35:29] arose and the storm
[35:30] rose and the winds blew and they were
[35:32] tossing and turning
[35:33] and on that sea god was watching the
[35:36] whole time
[35:37] and they got in the ship and they were
[35:39] afraid they were i'm gonna lose my life
[35:41] i'm
[35:42] these things are going to capsize this
[35:44] ship all these storms all these winds
[35:46] are going to
[35:47] push me over and going to take me out
[35:50] and this might not be
[35:51] might not have any more chances or this
[35:53] might be my last time
[35:55] but they never they never realized that
[35:57] god was watching him the whole time
[35:59] he was standing on the mountain he was
[36:00] looking down and he never
[36:02] he never let the winds he never let it
[36:05] go so far
[36:06] that it would take them that it would
[36:08] take them out
[36:10] and and he never let the winds and he
[36:13] said that's what the devil wants to get
[36:14] you
[36:15] he wants to get you separated from god
[36:18] separated from him distracted
[36:20] things come up things and you were just
[36:22] looking at
[36:23] your problems your circumstances you're
[36:25] not looking at
[36:26] that he's watching over you the whole
[36:28] time you become you start to doubt
[36:31] you start to you start to become afraid
[36:34] of the things that are around you
[36:36] not realizing that god got you that he
[36:38] understands
[36:39] what you're going through and he won't
[36:40] put more on you and you can bear the
[36:42] scripture says
[36:44] the scripture says um
[36:48] and the scripture said if god be for us
[36:50] then who can be against us
[36:52] it says that in romans 8 and 31 he said
[36:54] to god before us then who can be against
[36:56] us
[36:57] and don't be afraid of what's going on
[37:00] because in the midst of everything
[37:02] that's going on god always knew the plan
[37:05] he always knew what you were going to
[37:06] face he always knew
[37:08] what you were going to see he always
[37:09] knew what was going to come up
[37:11] and he said that he had never put more
[37:13] on you than you can bear
[37:14] and he'll never give you more than
[37:16] you're supposed to and you're supposed
[37:18] to have because if god gives you the
[37:20] test
[37:20] in the trial he gave you the will and
[37:23] knew that you were going to be able to
[37:24] withstand
[37:25] he knew that you were going to be able
[37:27] to make it he knew that you were going
[37:28] to be able
[37:29] to go through it and process through it
[37:31] and god was going to give you the
[37:32] strength
[37:33] he was going to give you the the power
[37:36] to be able to withstand the storm
[37:38] and he knew that their faith was failing
[37:41] in that
[37:42] he knew that they were sinking he knew
[37:44] that they needed encouragement
[37:46] so then he said you know what i'm going
[37:48] to go watch them i'm gonna go
[37:50] i'm gonna go to them to show them that
[37:51] i'm here i was watching but now i gotta
[37:54] go down and see my people
[37:55] i gotta go visit my people to show them
[37:58] that i
[37:59] am here i am with you and he he got in
[38:02] the ship
[38:03] and he said be of good cheer it is i be
[38:05] not afraid
[38:06] so you don't have to be afraid because
[38:09] god is out there he watching
[38:10] he looking at you he watching you in the
[38:12] school he's watching you in the homes he
[38:14] watching you at the job he's watching
[38:16] you
[38:17] he's he's putting his hedge about you
[38:19] and he said i got you
[38:20] i understand that it gets hard i
[38:23] understand
[38:24] that the trials of life are coming
[38:26] towards you things are on every hand but
[38:28] don't worry i'm gonna show up i'm gonna
[38:31] show up because you don't have to be
[38:32] afraid
[38:33] because i'll never leave you nor forsake
[38:35] you he'll be with you
[38:36] always even to the end amen and god has
[38:39] been so good and
[38:41] understanding that that he was watching
[38:44] over us i think
[38:45] in daniel chapter 3 about the hebrew
[38:47] boys
[38:49] and daniel chapter 3 with the hebrew
[38:50] boys he said
[38:52] in in the scripture they said let me
[38:55] just turn there daniel chapter 3.
[39:07] in the hebrew boys we know that
[39:09] nebuchadnezzar he built a
[39:11] he built a statue so many cubics high of
[39:14] gold and
[39:15] a statue in the and the three hebrew
[39:18] boys that recognized that it was a idol
[39:20] it was not the god of gods that had
[39:22] brought them that brought their people
[39:25] through the wilderness that had
[39:26] delivered them from pharaoh and he said
[39:28] thou shalt not put no other gods before
[39:30] me
[39:31] and in verse 16 it says and
[39:34] they come before the king and they would
[39:36] not bow to it and they came before king
[39:38] nebuchadnezzar and and they and
[39:41] nebuchadnezzar
[39:42] is asking them why won't you bow and
[39:44] they said it doesn't matter what you do
[39:46] if you threaten us to throw us in the
[39:47] fiery furnace
[39:48] we're not going to bow and verse 16 it
[39:50] says shadrach meshach and abednego
[39:53] answered and said to the king oh
[39:54] nebuchadnezzar we are not
[39:56] careful to answer thee in this matter if
[39:59] it be so our god whom we serve is
[40:01] able to deliver us from the burning fire
[40:04] reforms
[40:05] and he will deliver us out of thine hand
[40:07] but if not
[40:09] be it known unto thee o king that we
[40:11] will not serve thy gods nor
[40:13] worship the golden image which thou has
[40:15] set up
[40:16] they said if if god don't deliver me
[40:19] i still won't bow i still won't be
[40:22] afraid of what you
[40:23] what you can do to me because in the end
[40:25] of the road god already knew
[40:27] what was supposed to happen if i die
[40:29] today well i died
[40:31] knowing that i live i live the right
[40:33] life i live for the lord and the lord
[40:35] will always
[40:36] see his people he'll always watch over
[40:38] he always rewards them
[40:40] that diligently seek him amen and
[40:43] shadrach meshach and abednego they said
[40:46] we're not careful
[40:48] we're not even worried we're not even
[40:50] careful
[40:51] with how we answer you in this matter
[40:54] because they knew that if god be for us
[40:56] then who can be against us
[40:58] and they came and nebuchadnezzar they
[41:00] were able to be a witness
[41:02] to nebuchadnezzar they they got further
[41:05] down the scripture if you read it long
[41:06] further in that chapter you'll see where
[41:08] they got in the fiery furnace
[41:10] they were bound before they got there
[41:13] the heat was so hot
[41:15] it was killing the people that was
[41:16] taking them to the fiery furnace
[41:18] it was killing the people that were
[41:20] leading them there
[41:21] and they got into the but it never
[41:23] scarred them and never burned them even
[41:25] going into the fire furnace
[41:27] then when they finally got in there the
[41:29] only thing the fire burned was their
[41:30] change
[41:31] the only thing that the fire burned was
[41:33] the things that was holding them back
[41:35] from praising god the only thing that
[41:37] held them
[41:38] that was burned was their clothes didn't
[41:40] even burn
[41:41] they they were so protected by god that
[41:44] there was not even a smell of smoke
[41:46] on their clothes nothing was sins but
[41:49] the things that was
[41:50] holding them back from praising god and
[41:53] they got in and nebuchadnezzar was
[41:55] looking in that fiery furnace
[41:57] he looked there and he seen he said
[41:59] didn't we throw three men in there
[42:02] and then he looked twice he said i
[42:03] thought we threw three man he looked to
[42:05] his right
[42:06] he looked to his right and he said i
[42:07] thought we'd do three and they said we
[42:08] did
[42:09] he looked to his left i thought we threw
[42:11] three why why am i seeing four
[42:13] and the fourth man looks like the son of
[42:16] god
[42:17] nebuchadnezzar recognized that someone
[42:19] else was in that furnace and not just
[42:21] someone
[42:22] it was the son of god that was in that
[42:24] furnace with them and he called unto
[42:26] them and he told them to
[42:27] come on out of their fiery furnace and
[42:29] he said
[42:31] that he told him he said the god that
[42:33] you serve
[42:34] is not like like the ones that we serve
[42:37] it's the one and true god
[42:38] nebuchadnezzar recognized there was
[42:40] something different
[42:42] and also with don't be afraid
[42:46] don't be afraid to take a stand don't be
[42:49] afraid
[42:50] to stand up for for the lord stand up
[42:53] wherever you are
[42:54] don't be afraid to take to step forth
[42:57] and move
[42:58] forward and say lord i'm standing for
[43:00] you
[43:01] i'm standing for what's right i'm
[43:03] standing for what i believe
[43:05] because i know that lord that you never
[43:08] failed me
[43:08] and lord no matter how people may pick
[43:11] people may look at me wrong
[43:13] people may look at me disdain but in the
[43:16] end of the road it's not the reward
[43:18] the bible says lay not up for yourself
[43:20] treasures on earth where moth and rust
[43:22] do
[43:22] does corrupt but lay up for yourself
[43:24] treasures on heaven when neither moth
[43:26] nor rust does grow up nor thieves do
[43:28] break through and steal
[43:29] so it's not about the rewards that's
[43:32] here it's about the rewards that
[43:34] when you want to get to the lord and say
[43:37] you want to hear him say well done good
[43:40] and faithful servant
[43:42] because you stood for him you weren't
[43:44] afraid to take that stand
[43:46] when your friends looked at you so weird
[43:48] and your friends looked at you some type
[43:50] of way
[43:51] it didn't matter because you knew what
[43:53] god had done for you
[43:54] you knew that god was watching over you
[43:56] you knew that god was keeping you
[43:58] he was protecting you he was putting a
[44:00] hedge about you
[44:01] you knew that god was even though things
[44:04] things may not be going in the way that
[44:06] you thought
[44:07] god always had a plan that was right for
[44:09] your life
[44:12] and even going forward
[44:15] he said coming forward even to you can't
[44:18] be afraid to give god your life
[44:20] you can't be afraid to give him your all
[44:23] and commit to it
[44:25] and say that lord i accept you into my
[44:28] life
[44:28] because i want to give you my whole life
[44:31] my entire my will my plan my desires
[44:34] lord you take control don't be afraid to
[44:37] give them your life but then don't stop
[44:39] there
[44:39] don't be afraid to move forward there's
[44:42] steps past
[44:43] the steps past sanctification you got to
[44:45] go to justification
[44:46] and then there's give getting the
[44:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[44:50] so don't be afraid to get the
[44:51] justification and then stop and say i'm
[44:53] good
[44:54] no there's more to it you have to go and
[44:57] get the gift of god that he freely gives
[44:59] to each and every last one of us
[45:01] he said come to me all you that are
[45:03] heavy laden
[45:04] and heavy burden and i will give you
[45:06] rest take my yoke upon you and learn of
[45:08] me
[45:08] while me can lowly and still and you
[45:10] shall have rest for my soul
[45:12] so god promised to take your burdens the
[45:15] son one songwriter says take your
[45:17] burdens to the lord and leave them there
[45:19] amen he decided that he was going to
[45:22] bear your burdens
[45:23] he went to calvary for each and every
[45:25] one of us to save us
[45:27] to give us a way of escape in the old
[45:30] testament
[45:30] they had to continue to sacrifice lambs
[45:33] ghosts and for all their sins
[45:35] but god said come unto me and and lay
[45:38] your sins before me and i'll wash them
[45:40] white as snow
[45:41] amen i think what david said yea though
[45:44] i walk through the valley of the shadow
[45:46] of death
[45:47] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[45:49] thy rod and my staff
[45:51] that come from me that protect prepares
[45:53] the table before me in the presence of
[45:55] my enemy
[45:56] amen i anointed my head with oil surely
[45:59] goodness and mercy shall follow me
[46:01] all the days of my life and i will dwell
[46:04] in the presence of the lord forever amen
[46:07] david knew he had been through some
[46:09] experiences
[46:10] with god he knew that god was with him
[46:13] the bible says that david was a man
[46:15] after god's own heart
[46:17] and you see that he wrote the longest
[46:18] book in the bible because he had he said
[46:21] if i had 10 000
[46:22] tongues i couldn't praise you enough
[46:25] david knew that
[46:26] he couldn't be afraid of what god was
[46:28] going to do
[46:29] even if he did not know the plan even if
[46:32] he didn't understand
[46:33] what was going to happen he knew that he
[46:36] had to put his whole trust
[46:38] in god and not not in himself because he
[46:41] recognized
[46:42] that i can do nothing i can do nothing
[46:46] without god
[46:46] one songwriter said without god i can do
[46:49] nothing without him i would fail
[46:51] without him i will be drifting like a
[46:53] ship without a sail
[46:55] and i uh it's i understand that you
[46:58] think of another
[46:59] songwriter they said because he lives i
[47:01] can face tomorrow
[47:03] because he went to calvary and died for
[47:05] you and me i don't have to be afraid
[47:07] i don't have to stand there and wonder
[47:10] what's going to happen because i know
[47:12] that god has me in his hands he's
[47:14] watching over me he's protecting me
[47:17] he's keeping me so i can surrender my
[47:19] life to him
[47:21] i can decide lord i want you to be the
[47:24] head over my life
[47:25] i want to put you first because you know
[47:28] what's best for me
[47:30] you you got a plan that i even can't
[47:32] understand
[47:33] i don't understand sometimes i look back
[47:35] even in my life
[47:36] why i had to go through things and then
[47:39] years past time passed
[47:40] and you look back and you see how god
[47:42] was working
[47:44] how god was moving so some things you're
[47:46] going through and you don't understand
[47:48] but you can't be afraid in the midst of
[47:50] the trials in the midst
[47:52] of the test the don't be afraid of
[47:55] what's going to take place
[47:57] because god understands he understands
[47:59] your needs
[48:00] he he said that i will supply all your
[48:03] needs
[48:04] and he according to his riches and
[48:07] and mercies i think of how joshua and
[48:10] caleb when they came to the
[48:12] they came to the land and they went to
[48:14] spy out the land
[48:15] and they came back and there were eight
[48:17] people in front of them that testified
[48:19] we can't do it
[48:21] we can't they got up and they gave a
[48:23] testimony in front of the congregation
[48:26] and church
[48:26] that we we won't be able to possess this
[48:29] land
[48:30] it's too many giants there's too many
[48:32] obstacles
[48:33] it's too many things have you seen them
[48:36] look at the fruit that's in there and it
[48:38] took two people to bring the fruit out
[48:40] of there
[48:41] and said there's too many obstacles for
[48:43] us to possess it
[48:44] but caleb and joshua they knew that we
[48:47] can't be afraid god already promised us
[48:49] that that's our inheritance and they
[48:52] said we are more than able
[48:53] to conquer this land we don't don't
[48:56] doubt god because god
[48:57] already gave us a word and said we are
[48:59] more than able
[49:00] to take this land joshua and caleb they
[49:03] knew
[49:03] that they couldn't be afraid rahab the
[49:06] harlot all she had was a word
[49:09] all she had was a word she just knew
[49:12] that she had spared them and they said
[49:14] hang this cord here that's all she had
[49:16] to trust
[49:17] on she didn't have no bible to read she
[49:19] didn't have no
[49:21] no thus saith the lord she had a word
[49:23] from god's people
[49:24] that said hang this court here and you
[49:27] and your family will be saved and that
[49:30] and she trusted in that word
[49:32] she gave her undivided you know what i i
[49:35] have nothing to lose but to believe
[49:37] i have nothing to lose but to give my
[49:39] trust to the lord
[49:40] i have nothing to lose to believe in the
[49:42] god of jehovah
[49:44] because he brought up we've heard the
[49:45] stories of what god has done for you
[49:47] and your people she trusted him so so
[49:50] much that she said i'm on
[49:52] not only save me but save my family i'm
[49:54] going to bring everyone that i know into
[49:56] this house
[49:57] that will listen that will hear because
[50:00] i
[50:00] i know that i got a word from god that
[50:03] if they come in here and i hang here
[50:05] then all i have is a word and
[50:08] you think about the story of jesus met
[50:10] the harlot at the well
[50:12] in samaria and he met her
[50:15] on that road and the disciples was
[50:17] wondering why would he stay back to
[50:18] speak to
[50:19] what what the bible says as an ill-famed
[50:21] woman and
[50:23] he said that they they got there and
[50:25] they started congregating you know let's
[50:27] let's watch this
[50:28] let's hide over here in the bushes let's
[50:29] watch his interaction
[50:31] between jesus and the and the young lady
[50:34] and they said that
[50:35] jesus would ask the question he asked
[50:37] the question of the woman
[50:38] at the well he asked her he said where's
[50:40] my husband
[50:42] and they got over there and they said oh
[50:43] okay that's a good question
[50:45] so they got over there and they thought
[50:46] about it and she said i have no husband
[50:49] and all them over there thinking well he
[50:51] didn't well i thought he was the one but
[50:53] you know he got something wrong
[50:55] and then jesus came out of his mouth and
[50:57] he said he said
[50:59] you speak the truth you have no husband
[51:02] he said and and the one that you have
[51:05] five husbands
[51:06] the one that you with is not yours and
[51:09] jesus and they got over there and they
[51:11] were astonished the disciples were
[51:12] astonished
[51:14] just imagine just being there listening
[51:15] to this interaction
[51:17] and and understanding but she understood
[51:20] that she was she was in the midst
[51:23] of someone great she understood that
[51:25] this was not a normal interaction
[51:27] she had met someone she thought it was a
[51:30] prophet
[51:30] and she said and she asked him our dial
[51:33] prophet he said no i'm the one that was
[51:36] sent
[51:37] to to be the light for the age and she
[51:39] said our fathers told us of this thing
[51:42] and jesus said i am he and and she and
[51:44] the revelation struck her
[51:46] that she didn't have to be afraid no
[51:48] more she didn't she was so it struck so
[51:51] so in such a way that she ran back and
[51:55] told
[51:55] everyone and it struck us so and they
[51:58] knew something had changed so
[51:59] drastically
[52:00] that they came and saw the man that they
[52:03] saw the one that she was talking about
[52:05] because if god could do that for her
[52:06] what could he do for me
[52:08] if god could change her in such a
[52:10] drastic way
[52:11] she became she was no longer afraid to
[52:13] tell the story
[52:15] after all the things all the things that
[52:17] her past
[52:18] everyone that knew her and knew the
[52:20] things that she had been through
[52:22] understood that god had something had
[52:24] happened that was real
[52:25] a change had taken place she had she had
[52:28] given over she wasn't afraid
[52:30] to tell her testimony because she knew
[52:32] that god
[52:33] god had done something for her had
[52:36] changed her life and she wanted everyone
[52:37] to know
[52:38] she wanted everyone to know and not only
[52:41] she didn't even have to tell half the
[52:42] people
[52:43] they just saw they just looked upon her
[52:45] and saw
[52:46] that this is a change and
[52:49] going saying that don't be afraid don't
[52:52] be afraid to
[52:53] to step out on faith and believe god
[52:56] don't be afraid to step
[52:57] out on his word and say lord you said in
[52:59] your word
[53:00] when two or three are gathered in my
[53:02] name there i am in the midst lord
[53:04] so whatever i need lord you said that
[53:06] you supply all my deeds
[53:08] and everything that i need lord if you
[53:10] need salvation if you need
[53:12] heal and deliverance if you need power
[53:15] if you just need
[53:16] god to come and do something special in
[53:18] your life
[53:19] you don't have to be afraid because he
[53:21] will do it he will come and he will
[53:23] stand by you
[53:24] he will he will take everything that he
[53:27] is supposed to
[53:28] that he wants to do in your life and he
[53:30] will do it but you have to completely
[53:33] surrender you have to completely give
[53:34] your life to to the lord and say lord
[53:37] this is no longer mine
[53:38] but it's yours as the lord said it said
[53:42] in the prayer of gethsemane lord not my
[53:44] will
[53:44] but thy will be done and that's
[53:48] and just understanding the lord no
[53:50] longer even though he didn't want to
[53:53] take that cup he said lord not my will
[53:56] he wasn't
[53:57] he wasn't afraid because he knew how it
[54:00] would change
[54:01] and he gave us an opportunity to to save
[54:04] us he gave an opportunity a way
[54:06] to make it back to god to intercede for
[54:09] us
[54:10] amen and it's such a powerful thing to
[54:12] be able to give your life to god
[54:14] it's such a powerful thing to be able to
[54:16] say lord
[54:17] i trust you i give you everything lord i
[54:21] give you
[54:21] everything all my wills all my plans all
[54:24] my desires
[54:25] and know that he got you when other
[54:27] people are failing and list this
[54:30] and wondering what th what what should i
[54:32] do with my life
[54:34] you can give it to him and realize lord
[54:37] you got it you got that plan you got
[54:40] that thing
[54:40] and lord i trust you i believe in you
[54:43] and
[54:43] and i give everything to you in jesus
[54:46] name amen
[55:03] praise god amen i said
[55:09] god is good amen be not afraid amen
[55:13] it is our amen
[55:16] praise god be not afraid it is uh
[55:19] jesus still walks on water amen
[55:23] he still does the impossible he's still
[55:25] calm to rage at sea
[55:27] what he did yesterday he's the same god
[55:29] today
[55:32] he's in no situation no problem
[55:35] no storm that he can't come
[55:38] no wind that he cannot
[55:42] speak to the wind speak to the storm
[55:46] amen so god can speak to your storms he
[55:50] could speak to the wind
[55:52] he can calm the rage and see
[55:55] so it's nothing that god did then
[55:58] that he cannot do now
[56:02] amen if he did it then we could have
[56:04] that assurance that he's the same god
[56:08] yesterday today and forever
[56:11] and all we have to do is say god you're
[56:13] the same
[56:15] and i'm going to stand here i'm not
[56:17] afraid
[56:18] when i'm going through my storm i know
[56:20] you're there
[56:22] amen somehow the scripture said see
[56:26] jesus saw them tall then and when he saw
[56:30] him tall and on that sea
[56:33] he knew amen they was trying to
[56:37] amen get where they were going but
[56:42] they needed help so jesus just came
[56:45] walking on the wall amen
[56:49] in the midst of what we go through
[56:53] amen then jesus came
[56:58] our life amen needed
[57:01] a change jesus came walking
[57:07] he walked right in
[57:10] when i needed him the most
[57:13] jesus came
[57:17] i don't know where you were when he came
[57:19] i don't know what you
[57:20] were going through when he came but here
[57:24] come
[57:26] when you're going through you're trying
[57:28] time
[57:29] and i believe that's what is needed many
[57:31] times
[57:33] because sometimes people come and they
[57:35] thought when everything is going swell
[57:38] and well and everything and sometimes
[57:40] they don't
[57:42] fully recognize the impact
[57:47] of what salvation means and what god has
[57:51] done for
[57:53] sometimes they just you know they just
[57:56] it's just like jesus said the woman that
[57:58] has sinned much
[58:00] she'll love him much but sometimes folk
[58:04] amen they just think i i hadn't been
[58:08] bad enough i hadn't done anything wrong
[58:11] and they can't seem to love god uh
[58:14] enough to give them their own
[58:15] and sometimes god can deliver folk from
[58:18] so many things
[58:21] and but there's the they're getting
[58:22] amnesia they forget what
[58:24] what god done for him and where he
[58:26] bought them from
[58:29] amen so never forget amen
[58:32] then when god amen
[58:36] calm your troubled waters when god
[58:39] saved you when it came to you when you
[58:42] were going through your stone
[58:45] don't never forget what god done for you
[58:48] because there's so many people amen the
[58:50] reason they don't praise him because
[58:53] they forget wait
[58:54] amen amen there was a status
[58:58] amen praise god oh can't you see
[59:04] walking on a stormy sea
[59:07] praise god i can see them thinking it's
[59:09] in the spirit
[59:11] they meant but jesus stepped in the ship
[59:16] and everything got calm
[59:19] i'm gonna tell you something when jesus
[59:21] stepped in your
[59:24] i said when jesus steps into your ship
