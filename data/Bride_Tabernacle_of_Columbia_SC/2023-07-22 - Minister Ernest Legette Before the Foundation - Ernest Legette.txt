A Little Bit Stronger Lord and look to you God from which cometh the hills the hills which come to our health Lord we thank you tonight bless us just now Lord as we look to you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Ephesians 1. by the grace of God amen Ephesians 1 and very familiar scripture was started the first verse you gotta say Amen and it reads Paul and the Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus you may be seated I'm gonna read a little further down the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from our from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of of the glory of Glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of our of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mixture of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself that in a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him may God have bless the reading of his word tonight by the grace of God just for a moment we want to minister on a topic and I entitled it before the foundation amen before the foundation looking here in the fourth verse and how he's saying according as as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so so I want to talk about tonight before the foundation you know thank God and here just reading over these scriptures and I like how you know Paul was such a humble character even though in life uh in US in achievements and things he could have seen the at some point walk Head and Shoulders above some of the others but yet he he developed such a humble uh humility Spirit when when Christ got hold to him and it was because he had to recognize that you know even in all of his speeches and all his writings he talks about the grace of God especially here in Ephesians and talk about how the grace of God and the grace of God and he has chosen us it's by his grace it's by his grace so just looking at those things and and it's all you know pointing to to what he has done and I was beginning to think you know looking at it I says you know what what it is you and I we can look at our lives and and and how we've uh come a long way God has brought us a long way a mighty Long Way amen and how he's brought us along and we can look at the Times past and the mind frame that you had in times past and the lifestyle you model lived in times past and then you you start taking account of you know the mind frame you are now where you're sitting at now and you can look and say God is God has transitioned he's brought me a mighty long way and he ain't done with me yet but you begin to look at that sometimes and you can say to yourself how did I get here how how did I become what I am today but you know this ain't something that just started yesterday but this was before the foundations of the world before the world even began before the world was even formed God already had these things planned out in his mind he already had our paths set he already had the road established before the before like I said the foundation of the world before the foundation before it was even established before it was even formed God already had his thoughts you were already in his mind then at that place he already saw you he knew your flaws he knew what the the battles you'd have to fight he know the struggle but he know the road you'd have to take because he's the one that set that road so in that you know you looking at you says sometimes you know how did I how did I get her and all these things but then you begin to look and say it's not me but it's Christ that done these things I got nothing to Glory about except for if I Glory I want to glory in him you know somebody uh was talking today at the job and I was telling them about a situation that's like Ernest they said see they said you took the humble approach they said if I was you this is what I would have said and he was saying I would have said it like this because I'm Earnest that's what he said and I said the thing is I started laughing we both had to laugh I said it's not that I'm I'm taking the humble approach I said but the thing is I I recognize that God is in control of everything God is in control of every every situation I say God God I'm gonna let God handle things because he already got all this caught us by surprise but it didn't catch God by surprise he already knew that that trial would come that situation would come that destination be there and he's just he he want you and I uh to trust him he want you and I when we see these things we face with these things to realize that hey it's God that brought me it's God that brought me here and I'm not I'm not worried about these situations these trials I'm gonna let God I'm gonna let God handle them because it's him it's him I like how in the book of uh John how Jesus was beginning to say it because John 15 he said ye have not chosen me he says but I I've chosen you he said you ain't chose me but I chose you not only that he said but I ordained you that you might uh bring forth fruit you won't be unfruitful not only did I chose you but I ordained you that you're gonna bring forth fruit and then he says he goes on to say and the fruit that you're going to bring forth they're gonna remain I begin thinking about that in prayer I said Lord my spirits start to get started stirred I said you know what God has ordained us to bring forth fruit we didn't show we didn't choose him he chose us not only did he chose us but he ordained us to bring forth fruit so when the fruit come you don't have to worry about the wind shaking the tree come on because God said that that fruit will remain you don't have to worry about the storm nobody cutting the tree down nobody cutting the limbs off in the fruit come on he said but what I ordained you to bring forth fruit right he said and those fruit gonna remain so I said let the winds and all that blow God give us fruit that nobody can take away God give us something that even though it might look like it fell off all God doing is purging it that he can bring forth more and the next time gonna be more in abundance than it was the first time it'll be even greater why because God don't have two things Hallelujah I said that I said that's what it is God he said he let him know I chose you and I I want to encourage you I chose you come on you didn't just happen to be here on your own before the foundation of the world I chose you I could already write your name there you already overcome you're already Victorious you got battles and struggles you got to fight you might look at yourself uh sometimes as Gideon looked at itself and but when God looked at him what did he say to him come on you're a mighty man of Valor get in can look and say hey me I'm a mighty how are you gonna say I'm a mighty man of Valor and I'm sitting here hiding from my enemies every time I get a blessing the Devil come take it away so I got to hide it I got to run and worry about whether the devil gonna come tonight and steal my joy come on here how you gonna call me a mighty man of Valor as a matter of fact if God be with us then weigh all his miracles at come on but nevertheless in all of that he know he was just in himself at the time and what he was going through and sometimes that happens even to the greatest of of we look at the the children of God sometimes that happen to the greatest of Warriors they get in themselves sometimes and they can they all alone and all that but something has to come and most of the time it's through the word to stir you up and encourage you that hey you you looking at these things because you you you're somewhere along the line throughout all out of all the victories you got in yourself a little bit and all the victory somewhere along the line you forgot that it wasn't your strength but it was me behind your mouth that hand the whole time when I'm behind that hand it ain't your hand but it's a mighty hand and the only thing that makes that hand Mighty is because God is behind it Hallelujah so we find that ourselves you know he says you I've chosen you and our danger and I like how he goes on to say this at Saint John 15 he goes on to say that now our danger he said and that anything you ask of my father he'll give it to you not only did I chose you and our danger to bring forth fruit come on and they gonna remain but I also set it up to where anything you ask of my father he gonna give it to you oh that encourages us tonight and I said you know what as I was praying I said we have not because we ask not because Jesus said that he made it that we can ask anything of his father and he'll give it to us I said I'm gonna start asking Hallelujah ask for big things why because he's a big God ain't he sometimes we sit there and we we jealous of other people and what they have maybe they've been asking God maybe they realize that God he he set it up like he says that you can ask my father anything he'll give it to you that's the way I made it I ordained it that way I blessed you come on not just didn't just start now because you have some faithful memory are you some good uh boy or girl but before the foundation of the world before the world was formed you was in my mind Hallelujah everybody looking at your faults and where you're at and all those things he says but before the foundation of the world I already saw you coming Hallelujah I knew you'd come and I set it up that you're gonna be blessed you're gonna walk like kings in the earth hallelujah oh Jesus come on but before the foundation you know he says that he said you can ask anything then I but I like how he goes on to say he said but but one commandment I'm gonna give you that you love one another then he went to talking about love and how the world gonna hate you come on say the world gonna hate you say it but I want you to remember one thing that when the world hates you remember he hated me first come on but if but if if the world love you remember you might not be part of him but when the world hates you and rejects you don't feel bad about it remember they hated me and they rejected me but in all of the hate you feel blessed and all of the rejection come on all of the standing alone might be Vineyards and and forests or trees and ain't none unfruitful dried up come on but it might be a tree somewhere in the desert by itself say how is that tree thriving because it's an oasis down there you can't see the water but down in the dirt in The Roots come on it's water that's life something coming up Hallelujah y'all like that God can do those things though can he come on you say it but I I say one of the things we got to understand you don't want you uh get saved you know Lord Savior and all you know it's a battle it ain't it ain't an easy Road come on it ain't the easy Road I said but the thing I said you know I was looking at some things and you know uh our Lord uh brought me in coming up and I says but you gotta you gotta understand one of the things you got to quit wrestling with is that you you belong to God you don't belong to the devil you got to quit wrestling with that I belong to God come on and all God promises if I belong to him all I'm subject to all those promises everything he said I'm I'm Victorious I'm a conqueror I'm a I'm a warrior I'm a battle I'm a fight I'm I'm overcoming why because he overcame these things come on I thought that little scripture today uh the battle ain't your that's what I was saying my friend he said Ernest father did this I said you know I should have said I should have said but the Bible say come on that the battle ain't yours hallelujah it's whose it's God's ain't it and I believe that you know I says but what it is we got to quit wrestling you gotta you know I was sharing with my uh family the other night and how me and somebody was riding together I didn't say who it was we were riding together when it was uh teenagers and uh I was a teenager then they was older than me it was riding in the car and they told me they said you know you know we going to hell right that's what they told me and I look I said no I ain't going and they looked at me they said they said Jermaine so you know it's about the fabulous Jermaine they said so you think with all the bad we doing you going you ain't going to hell like that I said I ain't going he said see the problem is you didn't you ain't accepted see I don't accept it he said you gotta accept it come on but oh it didn't matter how bad we were doing at the time in my heart I still wanted God in my heart I didn't want to go to hell I wanted to go to heaven come on so even like I says in the midst of all that the devil can come to you use people come to you however and say hey you know you've gone too far I told somebody how you know you ain't going too far because it's still a desire there it's still something I don't care how bad you might think you you fell off or you gone but it's still a desire in there to do right it's still a desire in there that you want to please God it's still a desire still a something in there that want God and I say what you got to do you got to do the best that you know how do do all you know and God's gonna do the rest come on you can't save yourself you can't do it you you can't fight your own battles like it says I don't have to go to hell because he went there for me I don't have to go he went down there he took my place Hallelujah I didn't know it at the time but I found out one day when I wanted to get out of the mess that I was in I wanted to I wanted something to change in my life I was tired of living for the devil tired of of doing those things that seem to be Pleasures but was miserable on the inside lonely wanted God Hallelujah didn't know how to break out but I'm so glad that when I got to that place I said Lord if you help me that's what I said in a Motel 6 Lord if you help me get out of this place I I can to serve you all the days of my life God knows that he reached down right there Hallelujah did something for me wasn't never was perfect come on but little little and little he began to prosper me little and little he began to show me that if you lean on me Hallelujah I'll fight all your battles literally little he began to show me those things come on oh and he ain't done with me yet I'm still pressing on but what it is the more uh the more he does for me the more you recognize that it ain't about me it's about him the devil come to you that's a great test a big old test now what you're going to do the same God that brought me out the little star is going to bring me out these big storms he ain't doing nothing but perfecting me Hallelujah my faith is in him come on where's your faith today is your faith in him come on because what it is I I said I had this little saying the other week uh I said God saw you coming Hallelujah he saw you coming he knows who you are I said this something it's new to you but God saw this day coming now I saw you coming before he told uh Jeremiah before you was formed in your mother's womb I already knew you didn't and he said I I ordained you come on this ain't something you done if it was something you done then you can worry about losing it you can worry about it being taken away but when you didn't do it when you recognized it wasn't me but it was the mighty hand of God it was God himself that done it Hallelujah that was saying he took our place it was God that didn't when we stand before God you can't stand before him in your righteousness it says filthy rags you can't stand before him and nothing good you done or any or any of those things money can't buy your way out can it but you're gonna need something that supersedes anything that on this Earth they can give you and it's only one thing and that's the blood of Jesus Christ the bleeding lamb he did the things that we couldn't do I like that little song he paid the price that I couldn't pay hallelujah oh He Paid a Debt he couldn't know y'all know the song he paid it didn't he I was telling them the other day I said Mike can't sing it but I could preach it the songs amen but I said it's what it is I'm stirred about these things why because see the devil what it is you you got to recognize that you don't you belong to God come on before the foundation this ain't nothing that just started come on God judging you uh uh now now you know that we know how we know we ain't gonna go too far to the left or to the right but I said that you know you're looking at yourself like oh oh today tomorrow how I'm gonna do it come on ain't how I'm gonna do it this started before the world began before he I like how Paul said he chose us in him come on he chose us he chose me out of all that he could have used he chose me I'm not can't walk Head and Shoulders above nobody and says hey I'm the children no we could but I said the thing is it still ain't but what you did it's what Christ did it's what he did God picks and I'm glad that he does that he picks the violence of people don't he he don't pick the perfect people because there is none but he picks that one that knows he's insufficient no he didn't have no he was lost without hope no he didn't have a way out didn't have a business coming in the house of God he went to him though didn't he he brought the kingdom of God to him and they enjoyed it why because they were the chosen of God I like I I thank God for that tonight how many thank God for his choosing tonight come on I said before the foundation of the world like he told Jeremiah he said I chose you he says he said for your for your mother using for your mother's belly I already knew you I saw you coming come on and I know that you know you're going to have opposition you say I'm a child you said don't say that that don't mean nothing when God is for you when God is for you no matter who you are how big you are what color you are or any of those things when God is for you nobody can't be against you come on if God be for us who can be against us ain't that what the scripture says come on no matter how much money you got and all those things God is for you come on and he owned every cattle on the hill he's Almighty sitting on the throne come on giving rose with all power so no matter what the opposition is look look at look at who who's telling you hey I'm the one backing you I'm the one I'm doing it you didn't it didn't just start like we said before the foundation for years for under your mother's womb I already set you above Kings I already set you above Kingdom this day don't be afraid of their faces but I just want you to go out and speak my word I want you to go out and tell them what I tell you to say that's all I want come on I like how you know in Jeremiah Was was talking here I think it was Jeremiah 20 and 7 and he was saying you can go home and read it sometimes he was saying uh to himself when he was in prison one day and he was saying Lord he says you deceive me he said you deceive me he says because you told me that they wouldn't Prevail but they have prevailed against me you told me that you put me above them but ever since I began speaking in your name just paraphrasing it I ain't been having nothing but trouble people been mocking me he says but you but Lord you said that you that that I wouldn't be I wouldn't uh be uh they weren't prevailed against me that's what you said let's look at it Jeremiah 20 by the grace of God I was trying to paraphrase it but I'm slipping all over it Jeremiah 20 and 7. come on God is good tonight ain't he before the foundation that's one thing like I said we gotta we got to come to the Reckoning if you if you come to that reckon and that hey I belong to God come on nothing the devil can do the change God's mind about you you know he says I know my thoughts concerning Israel right he said and they're good and not evil I know I know nothing the way God saw you it's nothing that can uh nothing that anybody can do or any say that can change his mind sometimes you say Lord like Moses oh you picked the wrong one it wasn't me but no God knows exactly who who it was he knew what was in Moses because he had already ordained it right and no matter how much he kicked against and didn't want it nevertheless God already knew what was in him God already like was uh brother Josh was teaching in the Bible study of the image you know that that was in Michelangelo's mind just like God already envisioned you when he saw you he saw you even in all your flaws and all those things he saw you he ordained it that way he made you that way come on but nevertheless in all of that he was going to bring you out perfect how from through the blood shed blood of Jesus Christ not nothing you done but when you was lost without hope here come the savior when you was lost without hope Harry is riding on the cloud come on Heck on the Savior coming that when you held your head down and you said I'm lost but here come the Savior come on at that place your Lords in life at that lower spot that lowest moment hey come the Savior to let you know that there is hope how There's Hope in Christ you messed it all up you made a mess of it but I'm here to show you that in your mess that was in my plans the whole time because I'ma bring Perfection out of the mess I'm gonna bring a testimony out of the mess come on I'ma win Victory is out of the mess out of your mess gonna come testimonies that's gonna sack the world on fire out of your mess Hallelujah oh Jesus so it wasn't you but it was God that did those things then you can learn like Paul said in one place he said we all walk that way in times past he says but God come on who was rich in Mercy we all walk that way we felt bad about it but God who was rich in Mercy where where he loved us I thank God that he loved me when everybody walked and they said they loved you but but the action's so different come on let's be real people say they love you from their mouth but the action's so different don't it but it's something about God he don't just give mouth service like that but God's love is felt hallelujah it's genuine it's firm oh yes it is come on I believe that tonight Jesus Jeremiah 20 and 7. you gotta say man he says here in seventh verse Oh Lord thou has deceived me and I was deceived Thou Art stronger than I and has profiled I am in derision daily everyone mockets me but since I speak and I cried up I cried out I cried violence and spoiled because the word of the Lord was made of approaching to me and in the derision daily then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name come on but Jeremiah you know I can see like I said God told him you know I already set you it was a good salutation right because God told him I'd have made you I set you above Kings and kingdoms come on I made you above all them don't be afraid of them you Victorious you're on the mountain you Kings I set you above all those things but somewhere along the line after being uh beaten thrown in jail fed with bread Affliction all those things and suffering and going through and being rejected of me and his family everybody walk away from them hit in the mouth and all those things right somewhere along the line he's he began to think about the promise that God made him and said Lord you said that you set me above you said that I'll be a problem he said but you deceived me that's how he got in himself didn't he because I'm I'm here bound going through trials he never said you wouldn't have trials and tribulations he never said that storms would come did he but he said he'd be there when they did I like that he never said that you wouldn't have to fight but he said that every place a soul on your foot tried upon I'll give it to you Hallelujah you're gonna have to fight but I'm gonna give you the victory oh Jesus wouldn't have to fight right but we get that mixed up sometimes don't we we believe that because we the chosen of God and God is your father and your king son sometimes you ain't gonna have to go through but no that's even the more ain't it remember because you rejected of all men rejected of the world yes God has given you veteran in all those things then he began to save but but in the very next verse he began to say but his word was was like it was so in my heart it was like fired I was shut up in my bones and they began to talk about those things and even begin to glorify God because even in the midst of all of that you know he realized that that God ain't left from God was still there because what he was prophesying was the truth you know he was hated because he told them the truth Hallelujah he was hated because he told them that if you didn't get right come on the Babylonians was coming you don't straighten out they gonna take the city and burn it with fire and they hated them didn't they and they knew they was doing wrong but yet they hated them didn't they and it seemed like he suffered for them but no he didn't suffer he was right there in the will of God wasn't he he suffered but he was right there in the will of God he was right there doing well in in the end Hallelujah he can look back and say God you never failed me middle in a minute that album you were still there when destruction came I was saved why because God kept This Promise didn't he Hallelujah I like that I said the thing is you know sometimes you know we believe that come on that even though it's for the foundation of the world things we chosen of God that we won't have to go through nothing but like I said even the more because what is what is God doing God is perfecting us ain't he God is perfecting us he's bringing I wrote some things down you know he's bringing some some things out of us you know and and he's bringing things out of us because he wants to perfect us he he knows it's a place in his mind before the foundation in the world he saw us it's a place in a Perfection there you know I was I was sharing with uh the church I was saying you know coming up and I can look at all your friends and all those things and but some of us came to certain Crossroads in life and maybe those roads LED down four or five different lanes and somebody might have took off down this Lane I was I was just going in prayer going about it but I started preaching on it by saying maybe you know the crowd could have said hey this road right here is big enough for all of us to walk down let's walk down it together come on a minute you'll go that pathway won't they they need to have something say hey no we'll take this road or we'll take that road but as I was in prayer I could see I says but then here come that that's that role that only one person can walk down at a time hey come that road that didn't have the street lights it was dark down that road that road that looks like spooky coming down that road but when everybody else took the broad in a lit up path everybody else took the easy route and the route where everybody can go together something and you was attracted to that straight in that narrow way something you was attracted to that to that like he says he ordained us to be holy something inside you attracted you down that Holy Rock wow something you know you need to be picked that you knew you'd be rejected and laughed at in person calls you Hallelujah the Deep call to the Deep something was bidding you come you didn't understand it but I thank God that the Deep call to the deep I thank God that he drew on me he chose he pulled me down that road people say Ernest where you going we we all over here we can walk together God called you alone Hallelujah don't he individuals come get near to me I want to show you who I am look like ain't no lights down this path but I'm the light of this path come on his word is like a laptop feet like to our Pals I'm gonna light out the path Come On In The Valley in the shadow of death you don't have to fear no evil he said I'ma be with you you heard him calling you you couldn't see him but you heard him calling you down that path come on I was having a little Revival to myself in prayer I said but it's the truth though ain't it and I thank God because he's still leading you down that path ain't he you get down halfway down the road you said God we we ain't finished yet the journey ain't over yet come on God is still safe so you say Lord I still need you to hold my hand I ain't too grown well I don't need you to hold my hand come on I ain't too down down the road where I can say Lord I got it and I can walk by myself no God hold my hand keep me in your arms Hallelujah don't ever take your hands off of me oh because if God did the devil to have his way with you but I said God keep your arms around shout to me keep me in your arms that's what I want how many want that tonight but I said that that's what it is but the raccoon before the before the foundation of the world I says that's what God brought us two but but in seeing those things and I had a couple of things I wanted to talk about tonight but and to go along with that but in seeing those things you know I says in seeing that that give you confidence you know that where we are now no devil in hell could have stopped us from getting here and where are we going no devil in hell could stop you from going there because that way is ordained by God so all we doing is yielding to the image that he had of us in his mind all we doing is saying Lord here I am make me what you saw of me make me that God I got uh missions and goals but I I might want to be this and that but God I want to be what you saw of me whatever you what you saw me Lord don't let me fight against it because I got to get there anyway but just let me yield to what you got for me let me yield to what you have of me if I got to walk alone that's what I want I want to yield to it God help me to do that in seeing that because I know that that path no devil can't stop you from going on that path you know I was thinking about I said the image what God had in his mind I don't care how much the the world had a hold on you and how much the lust and things had a hold of and grip on you the devil had no other choice but when God say it's time to let you go he had no other choice but to let you go because God said it's time now come on I saw you coming and Now's the Time Hallelujah the devil had to say they mine I got him I'm accusing him but he says I've died to take their place the blood and set them free Hallelujah he had no other choice but to let you go right and that encouraged you you could shout the victory you can say thank you Lord hallelujah I ain't understand all of it but God I'm seeing it little by little each and every day and I thank God for it that what he's saying just start now but it was before the like I said the foundation of the world he chose us to reveal to reveal his uh son in us you know his brother Jeremiah comes tonight I says before the foundation of the world you know I was telling I was telling Moses and I thought I'd say this tonight I was telling Moses the other day we were uh was it maybe at the house I think I was riding on the car or something and I was telling him I said you know the time will come I said when uh people wish they had been more for God I told him I said the time Gonna Come where people gonna wish Lord I wish I because everything else didn't matter is everything else was so important nobody had you had you gave God the smallest you can give him you gave them the littlest that you can give him out your life you get them that's all you gave them because everything else was taking up too much of your time you was too busy too much of time too much your space but I was telling Moses we're just talking I said the time will come with many of us wish that they could have that they would have took out more time for God that time will come amen's a brother Jeremiah [Applause] man I mean you appreciate the word that's good to be in the house of the Lord and more so than that you know I was just read his brother Ernest was speaking you know and uh as we understanding you know the will of God for our lives and the things of God that he has given to us and seeing I believe we've seen the servant of God was saying that Ephesian Church Aid they had come to a place that they had matured and they uh a little more uh knowledgeable in the things of God to be more settled and regard began to deal with of him in this Paul he was trying to get to the Church of the place that we had not just tossed about whatever with our Doctrine in me we know where we came from and know where we're going amen and I know it's it's getting clearer and clearer our view to each and every one of us now that we understand that God had a purpose for our lives amen but the nothing that we did to deserve it it was God grace did that and nothing you can do about it you can't stop it amen but God will will be done amen amen so we're not going to try to prolong the service any uh by God's grace so y'all just continue to be praying for a pastor and those and the services coming up this week and man so we look at them in just to try to finish up the tent work at least by Monday maybe like God's grace so I'm gonna try to get everything done some tomorrow some Monday and try to maybe put the chills out either Tuesday or Wednesday something like that Tuesday because Wednesday to be in Sumter I'll be the brother Keith to be preaching down there by gods Grace let us all stand tonight I'm telling you to read those things and hear those things it does something you know turn it in a man because you really see yourself as being nothing I mean it was all God all the time your path my path what you did what you've been going through God orchestrated but now look at you who would ever thought we would arrive at this place in our lives right now I mean because we know that our lives always said it was a mess remember that's when God come on the scene amen I mean that's just about at this time Heavenly
