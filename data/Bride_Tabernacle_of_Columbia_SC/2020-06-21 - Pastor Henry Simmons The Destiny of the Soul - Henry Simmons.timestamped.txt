[28:46] Jesus name Amen
[28:50] the book of
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] is equal 18 The Book of Ezekiel 18 and
[29:07] reach the word of the Lord came to me
[29:12] again saying what mean ye that you use
[29:20] this proverbs concerning the land of
[29:23] Israel saying the father have eaten sour
[29:28] grapes and the children's teeth are set
[29:33] on edge as I live saith the Lord God you
[29:42] shall not have an occasion any more to
[29:47] use this proverb in Israel behold all
[29:53] souls are mine the soul of the father so
[30:00] also the soul of the son is mine the
[30:05] soul that sinneth it shall die the
[30:12] subject matter this morning the destiny
[30:18] of the soul judge where is the soul
[30:27] headed the destiny of the soul so top it
[30:37] thus mourn and being there for death
[30:42] began you may be seated
[30:45] appreciate everyone the destiny of the
[30:49] soul before death began sometimes there
[31:00] are many definitions that they give
[31:05] concerning what solely
[31:10] but we understand in Genesis 1 when God
[31:15] created man he created him in his own
[31:19] image and it's all lockness male and
[31:28] female created he them what happened was
[31:32] that man was spirit man with God created
[31:43] Adam Eve was hidden inside of Adam but
[31:49] they were spirit did as his to tell us
[31:53] the God formed man from the dust of the
[31:56] ground and then we hear that when he
[32:04] formed him of the dust of the ground he
[32:06] breathed in his nostrils the breath of
[32:10] life and man became a living soul so man
[32:19] became a living soul we are told the
[32:24] difference between the animal world and
[32:28] man the animal have flesh and blood and
[32:36] it had the spirit but man has a soul
[32:43] soul sometimes we would look deep within
[32:49] and say what is my soul what is the
[32:56] destiny of my soul what we understand
[33:01] that Word of God tells us this morning
[33:12] you
[34:08] is the house that the soul lives in and
[34:18] because of the body MANET seemed to be
[34:23] more interested and is exterior than
[34:29] interior but you must be concerned about
[34:37] the destiny of your soul when God told
[34:46] magnet and the tree of the garden you
[34:50] may freely eat but the tree of knowledge
[34:52] of good and evil for the day you eat
[35:02] land
[35:07] made a decision and was influenced by
[35:13] the serpent as it is today the
[35:19] Supplemental serpent called the devil
[35:22] has influenced mankind to death he calls
[35:30] Eve took out one word and because of her
[35:38] doubted one way deaf Keamy Bible tells
[35:46] us that the soul that sinneth shall die
[35:54] so days a destiny a destination that
[36:02] Santa comes in - and what was the sin of
[36:10] unbelief that he doubted what God see
[36:17] and believe what the devil told her how
[36:24] many today believe in 9 the cup from the
[36:29] devil instead of trusted what the way
[36:34] has sat us friends of mine sometimes man
[36:46] don't want to believe the Word of God
[36:52] and that death is real conduct he meant
[37:00] it as much as death is real I like for
[37:06] you to look with me today in Hebrews 9
[37:13] the reality
[37:18] amen of the destiny of the soul for
[37:26] Hebrews 9 begins to tell us that we have
[37:34] an appointment
[37:38] ebrill 9 in 27 it says that it is
[37:47] important appointed to men once to die
[37:53] but after this the judgment
[38:04] mine comes to an apartment that everyone
[38:13] that forward of a woman has to come to
[38:18] me and a pony time is an appointment
[38:28] supported the man once to die and after
[38:37] you die no judgment towards me is coming
[38:45] for each and every one of us too small
[38:50] may not be a sound message but I want
[38:54] you to hear that you are returning and
[38:58] you're going somewhere and where are you
[39:03] going
[39:05] determines that is Satan that you make
[39:10] so I would to God that
[39:20] the inside of a woman when she's
[39:25] pregnant she had a craving for sadness
[39:31] type of food that the baby inside of her
[39:36] is craving for so why she's pregnant my
[39:41] wife
[39:42] she wanted t-bone steak and it was just
[39:47] about every day I found myself going and
[39:53] buying her a t-bone but it wasn't that
[39:59] she wanted the people it was the craving
[40:04] that the baby that she was carrying on
[40:07] the inside my son wanted a t-bone is
[40:18] from the each side that you sold is
[40:22] craving five even God the soul has a
[40:33] desire I want to say after my wife after
[40:41] my son was born she almost never eats
[40:50] steak
[41:00] you see what I'm saying
[42:31] [Music]
[42:38] but he began to speak but he said this
[43:23] [Applause]
[43:29] are you brothers and sisters they made
[43:39] many talked about the soul and sometimes
[43:47] I've heard God's servants a soul is the
[43:51] nature of the spirit and what's awkward
[43:56] separates the soul from the spirit is
[44:01] the god word it's quick powerful sharper
[44:07] than any two-edged sword of the Sun they
[44:14] men it could reach the jokes in the
[44:16] marrow I need to go down to the soul and
[44:20] the spirit but God can tell separate the
[44:28] soul from the spirit are you what
[44:32] they're the soul recognized condition
[45:09] for magic leaving only inside I believe
[45:17] such a gorgeous five talks about
[45:27] I'm telling you it's an after house
[45:30] that's carried the spirit in the soul
[45:36] but the house I want to thank you about
[46:06] that you take about the destiny of the
[46:10] soul and the food death what was man
[46:16] like before death death brought about
[46:21] sin bought about death and seeing
[46:27] because Manon disbelieved away and San
[46:36] calls death and that speaks of land is
[46:42] separated from God and being separated
[46:49] from God that's like a wire would not
[46:54] discern if the Sun was not here the
[47:01] grass wouldn't grow and the Sun causes
[47:12] the world that we live in to be seen and
[47:19] the natural earth without the Sun
[47:24] everything will be in chaos and in
[47:28] darkness brother sister
[47:33] we need the Sun without the Sun he said
[47:55] to a world that was in darkness let up
[47:59] in life and God said to you and I when
[48:09] we were in darkness they could see but
[48:15] it's amazing grace came to see about you
[48:19] and I all you with me today
[48:24] God love us God about us before death
[48:33] there was a man in the image of God and
[48:36] in the likeness of God man that didn't
[48:40] know anything about time because he was
[48:45] living in eternity he meant so man comes
[48:50] out of time in to come out eternity at
[48:53] the time but where are we going
[48:56] Jesus come to take us back to when he
[48:59] came from going back from time back to
[49:03] eternity back from the prison house he
[49:09] meant for he said and first Peter 3 amen
[49:15] he said the spirits that were imprisoned
[49:18] in the times of no he meant the word
[49:25] they meant and then he talks about the
[49:29] souls that was saying was only each
[49:35] Souls than the time of the flood I'm
[49:40] talking about last long and we have the
[49:45] sense of
[49:46] / hey Dad the Holy Ghost can be only
[49:51] inside but we're in a present house fall
[49:58] this body that we have it holds back our
[50:03] potential because it does not yet appear
[50:09] what we shall be seen what God will do
[50:22] for you and I why because this
[50:25] corruptible is holding us up this flesh
[50:30] is holding our PR Feeney
[50:34] but one day amen we're gonna break the
[50:39] chains of death the last enemy that's
[50:44] gonna be destroyed is death
[50:47] we're gonna tear the flesh you can't
