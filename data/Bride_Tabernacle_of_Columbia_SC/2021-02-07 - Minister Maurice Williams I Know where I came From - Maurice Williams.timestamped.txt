[43:20] book of john this morning
[43:22] go start dave chapter
[43:26] verse amen hallelujah how many trust in
[43:29] god this morning
[43:31] amen
[43:35] man i see brother ernest got one on the
[43:36] drums amen scripture say train up a

[43:40] hallelujah praise the lord that's good
[43:42] to see
[43:43] put on the word gabe appreciate all of
[43:45] you this morning
[43:48] the gospel of john amen name chapter
[43:57] let's start the 14th verse we're going
[43:58] to skip around a little bit amen there's
[44:00] a lot that he's saying they've been in
[44:02] the
[44:02] eighth chapter of the gospel of john and
[44:05] if you want the background on the story
[44:07] this is when
[44:08] jesus went up to mount olive amen and he
[44:11] was actually in the process of preaching
[44:13] and teaching the people
[44:14] and while he's preaching to the people
[44:16] this is when the pharisees come storming
[44:18] in and they're dragging this woman
[44:19] along with them and said look we caught
[44:21] in the very act of adultery
[44:25] they interrupt the service that lord has
[44:26] gone on
[44:28] and they say you know this is the law of
[44:30] moses what should we do amen they
[44:31] thought they was going to trap him and
[44:33] of course we know the story he said
[44:34] leahy that is without sin let them cast
[44:36] the first stone
[44:37] and the scripture let us know that from
[44:38] the oldest all the way down to the
[44:40] youngest they turned and walked away
[44:42] and after they turned and walked away
[44:44] then all of a sudden jesus christ starts
[44:47] to preach a little bit more because
[44:48] this is an inspiring moment this is an
[44:51] inspiring situation
[44:53] because you see people trying to use the
[44:56] word of god
[44:57] deceitfully and in the 14 verses what
[45:00] jesus said amen he
[45:02] jesus answered and said unto them though
[45:04] i bear record of myself
[45:07] yet my record is true for i
[45:10] know whence i came and whether i go
[45:15] but you cannot tell whence i come
[45:18] and whether i go let's go down to the
[45:20] 23rd verse
[45:22] and he said unto him unto them
[45:25] you are from beneath he already setting
[45:28] up that there's going to be a distinct
[45:30] difference between the two of them you
[45:33] are from
[45:34] beneath i am from above
[45:39] you are of this world i want y'all to
[45:42] read this part with me this morning
[45:44] because this should be your testimony
[45:46] i am not of this
[45:49] world praise god hallelujah
[45:52] let's move over to the 42nd verse amen
[46:00] said unto them if god were your father
[46:03] you would love me if i proceeded forth
[46:06] and came from god
[46:07] neither came out of myself but he sent
[46:10] me
[46:11] how many glad to be sent by almighty god
[46:13] this morning
[46:14] why do you not understand my speech
[46:17] there's a lot of people out there that
[46:18] does not understand the speech almighty
[46:20] god
[46:21] even because you cannot hear my word
[46:26] you of your father the devil that's
[46:28] putting it bluntly
[46:29] and the lusts of your father you would
[46:31] do he was a murderer from the beginning
[46:34] and a bold not in the truth because
[46:36] there is no truth in him
[46:38] when he speak of a lie he's speaking
[46:40] from his own for he is a liar
[46:42] and the father of it we're going to turn
[46:44] one most pl spot of scripture in the
[46:47] gospel of john to the 13th chapter
[46:50] third verse i'll just read it to you
[46:52] amen
[46:54] jesus knowing that the father had given
[46:55] all things into his hands
[46:57] that he was come from god and he went to
[47:00] god amen
[47:01] we joined a lot of emphasis on where the
[47:03] lord said that he came from in the word
[47:05] the lord said that he was going back to
[47:08] and if we can get you to understand this
[47:10] morning where you came from
[47:12] and what you're going back to where you
[47:15] came from and what you're going back to
[47:17] it's going to even out everything else
[47:19] in the meantime maybe
[47:22] so so our title for this morning just
[47:24] for a few minutes of your time this
[47:26] morning it's going to be i know
[47:28] where i come from amen i know
[47:32] where i come from let's just buy our
[47:34] heads this morning heavenly father
[47:37] in the lovely name of jesus christ lord
[47:40] lord we know no other name that can do
[47:43] the things that you do
[47:46] there's no other name that could be our
[47:48] redeemer
[47:50] there's no other name that could give us
[47:52] strength for we need strength
[47:54] there is no other name lord that can
[47:57] settle us down father god
[47:59] when everything is breaking loose around
[48:01] us lord
[48:03] lord you've been our friend lord you've
[48:05] been our healer lord
[48:06] you've been our redeemer father god lord
[48:09] you've been our comforter lord when we
[48:10] needed confidence
[48:12] we thank you for that father god lord we
[48:15] thank you for the opportunity lord to
[48:16] come out as a body of believers this
[48:18] morning lord
[48:19] despite all that's going on all around
[48:21] us lord you have kept your people lord
[48:24] and you've given us another opportunity
[48:26] father god
[48:27] to lift up the name of jesus christ lord
[48:30] we never take that for granted
[48:32] we never take that lightly lord but we
[48:34] thank you lord
[48:35] lord we ask that lord your spirit will
[48:36] flow through our midst
[48:38] in the lovely name of jesus christ lord
[48:40] that no believer lord will leave
[48:43] this place lord the same way that they
[48:45] came in
[48:46] we think in the mighty name of jesus
[48:48] christ at the saints say amen
[48:50] amen you can be seated this morning
[48:52] hallelujah
[48:54] glory to god amen i used to preach to no
[48:57] quiet church so i
[48:58] i pray that y'all help me preach a
[48:59] little bit this morning
[49:01] but you know it's like to tell the
[49:03] people the ministry we don't come out to
[49:05] do nothing deep for you
[49:06] the only thing we come out to do is show
[49:09] you what the promised book of god
[49:11] has already said about you show you what
[49:14] the promised book of god
[49:15] has already said or what's going to take
[49:18] place in your life
[49:20] remind you who you are remind you of
[49:23] what you mean to almighty god amen
[49:26] and if we remind you of those things
[49:28] that should be able to give you
[49:30] great boldness in the face of the enemy
[49:32] in the sideways man
[49:35] see the word has expressed different
[49:37] things about you
[49:38] and it's expressed different things
[49:41] about your life amen
[49:43] it's shown us that we are different from
[49:45] the rest of the world
[49:48] and sometimes you know there might be a
[49:50] point in time in your life
[49:51] where you shy away from that and shy
[49:54] away of the aspect of being
[49:57] and shy away or the aspect that maybe
[49:59] god has called you
[50:01] to something higher but saints i trust
[50:03] by now that you are able to embrace
[50:06] those things
[50:07] that almighty god has called you to be
[50:09] different
[50:10] that almighty god has separated you amen
[50:14] just like he separated israel from the
[50:16] rest of the heathen nations all around
[50:19] them
[50:19] almighty god has separated out a bride
[50:22] of christ in this
[50:24] hour the bride is placed differently
[50:27] from the rest of the woman amen
[50:29] the bride is placed differently from the
[50:31] rest of the churches out there
[50:33] that's why you call bride tabernacle
[50:36] because jesus christ is your husband
[50:38] and your husband is holding you to a
[50:40] higher standard this morning
[50:43] so we can embrace being different
[50:46] hallelujah
[50:47] glory to god we can embrace having
[50:50] a different set of expectations
[50:53] hallelujah
[50:54] because the expectation for you as a
[50:57] body
[50:57] believer this morning is different from
[50:59] the expectation of the rest of the world
[51:01] amen
[51:03] you can embrace having a different
[51:04] quality
[51:06] because almighty god will have to call
[51:08] you for you to be able to walk in this
[51:10] way
[51:11] almighty god got to call you to it
[51:14] but the sin brother brother simmons he's
[51:16] a very good past amen
[51:19] he preached the word with conviction
[51:20] amen and
[51:22] he could teach that thing to you at the
[51:23] same time but if you just follow along
[51:26] amen because brother simmons said some
[51:28] good words to you amen
[51:29] you're gonna fall short you have to be
[51:34] called to it amen and the call of
[51:37] almighty god
[51:38] is not for everybody hallelujah i'm
[51:40] gonna say it again
[51:41] the calling of almighty god is not for
[51:44] everybody
[51:45] but the bible lets us know he that has a
[51:47] ear
[51:48] let him hear amen what the spirit is
[51:50] saying unto the people of god
[51:56] you know that call and found out to be
[51:58] something separate back in the time of
[52:00] samuel
[52:01] hey samuel was a young man and the bible
[52:03] lets us know
[52:04] he was laying in his bed one night and
[52:06] he kept hearing a voice that was calling
[52:08] his name
[52:10] say samuel samuel you know saying it'll
[52:12] be him being a good young man he get up
[52:13] and come running because the bible lets
[52:15] us know that the word of the lord was
[52:17] precious in those days
[52:19] what it meant was that that god wasn't
[52:21] speaking openly to the people at that
[52:23] point in time
[52:24] through his prophets as he generally did
[52:26] in the times past
[52:28] amen so the word of lord was very
[52:29] precious it was a rare thing so samuel
[52:32] did not recognize at that point in time
[52:34] that that was almighty god speaking to
[52:37] him he thought that was the priest he
[52:38] was with eli speaking to him amen
[52:41] he would go running to the priest i'm
[52:42] here brother amen he said i didn't call
[52:44] you i don't know why you're running to
[52:46] me
[52:46] so sam you go back to bed amen and y'all
[52:48] know the story happened again samuel
[52:50] come running he hear the voice amen
[52:52] and by then he lost us to perceive that
[52:54] it's almighty god
[52:56] calling him amen and his samuel was able
[53:00] to hear a word from almighty god
[53:02] because it was almighty god doing the
[53:05] calling amen
[53:06] and you understand that samuel wasn't
[53:08] just any type of young man
[53:11] coming on the scene but saying it was
[53:13] even born coming out of his mother's
[53:15] womb
[53:15] with a promise and a purpose already
[53:18] over his life
[53:23] when he had him to begin with amen it
[53:26] was certain promises
[53:28] that was promised unto samuel and now he
[53:30] was just stepping
[53:32] into the thing that was already promised
[53:34] for him
[53:36] you being a believer there are certain
[53:39] things
[53:40] that almighty god said about you
[53:43] and said about your life from before the
[53:46] foundation of the world
[53:48] even before you came out of your
[53:50] mother's womb
[53:52] and that's what allowed you to hear the
[53:54] call in the voice of almighty god
[53:57] because he gave you a different set of
[53:59] ears to be able to hear amen
[54:03] at a time where the word of the lord is
[54:05] precious
[54:07] god is allowing some people to fully
[54:10] hear
[54:10] and fully understand where he's going
[54:13] amen
[54:14] and where he's bringing us to him how
[54:16] many of the lord this morning
[54:18] hallelujah you know we talk about being
[54:21] a christian amen
[54:23] you have to understand that a christian
[54:25] is built different ain't no way around
[54:27] it now christian has to be
[54:28] built different christian has to have
[54:31] a different mindset amen i already told
[54:34] you a christian
[54:35] has a different calling and the word
[54:38] christian brother brandon taught us is
[54:39] that that word christian means
[54:41] to be christ-like glory to god
[54:46] because a lot of people talk about jesus
[54:48] and talk about god amen
[54:50] but how many are pushing to be
[54:52] christ-like amen
[54:55] see without calling to be christ-like
[54:57] that is a calling
[54:59] for us to reflect the things and reflect
[55:01] the nature
[55:03] of our heavenly father amen and it's a
[55:06] hot honor
[55:07] amen it's a high privilege for us to be
[55:09] able to to take upon the name of christ
[55:12] to take upon the aspects of being
[55:15] christ-like because a lot of people out
[55:18] there in the world
[55:19] i reflect in a totally opposite nation
[55:23] we read in the scripture this morning to
[55:25] hear jesus christ is on the scene
[55:28] and he wasn't talking to uh uh the drug
[55:32] dealers or
[55:33] the prostitutes the things that nature
[55:35] where he was saying this
[55:36] but he was talking to the pharisees he
[55:39] was talking to the people that
[55:40] that had the letter of the word amen but
[55:43] but their hearts was far from the word
[55:45] amen
[55:46] and what he told these preachers now
[55:48] this is what he telling the preachers
[55:50] that's not what he's telling the dog on
[55:51] the street
[55:51] he told the preachers that you were of
[55:54] your
[55:54] father the devil
[56:00] there were a lot of of hurtful things
[56:03] that you could say
[56:04] that somebody ain't gonna i think i told
[56:06] you before you can call somebody a rat
[56:08] or
[56:08] a car somebody a dog or a snake amen
[56:12] your daddy is no good your daddy is a
[56:14] deadbeat dad
[56:15] but to say that you of your father the
[56:18] devil
[56:20] that's a high-level insult
[56:23] and that's what he was telling the
[56:25] ministry at that point in time but
[56:30] if there was some that were there of
[56:32] that wicked one
[56:33] there had to be some that was made in
[56:36] the very image of god amen
[56:38] there would have to be something that
[56:40] shaped in the very likeness of god i
[56:42] mean
[56:43] there would have to be some amen that
[56:45] have a calling
[56:46] that could reflect that calling amen
[56:49] know exactly
[56:50] who they are where they came from and
[56:53] because they
[56:54] know exactly what they're going back to
[56:59] god called us in that calling amen it's
[57:02] why the brothers act like
[57:03] brothers this morning amen it was good
[57:06] to hear the brothers amen coming up here
[57:08] praying before almighty god this morning
[57:10] amen it
[57:12] caused the sisters to act like sisters
[57:14] and to dress like
[57:15] sisters amen and to wear their hair like
[57:18] sisters amen because you're reflecting
[57:20] that you are different
[57:22] you are reflecting your heavenly father
[57:25] you're reflecting the things that the
[57:27] word of god
[57:28] has told you to do
[57:33] come on now we carry ourselves
[57:34] differently when we go to work okay man
[57:36] hallelujah i hope we do not glory to god
[57:40] if you could tell every joke that
[57:42] everybody else telling amen and
[57:44] everybody else talking about how much
[57:45] alcohol they drunk over the weekend amen
[57:47] you right there with me now
[57:49] now you're not in this separate calling
[57:50] that i'm talking about it man
[57:52] but but hopefully amen somebody at the
[57:55] job can recognize that you conduct
[57:57] yourself
[57:58] differently man you act differently amen
[58:01] hopefully your family members that might
[58:03] not be in the masses they ca
[58:04] they can recognize something different
[58:07] about you amen
[58:08] because what we're doing saints we're
[58:10] representing and showing
[58:12] that we're not from here amen but that
[58:15] we got a different place
[58:16] all together that we are from
[58:20] and almighty god is allowing that to
[58:23] reflect through
[58:24] you as a believer in jesus christ this
[58:27] morning amen
[58:28] let's get the lord some praise
[58:31] hallelujah amen
[58:34] it's a different calling amen you know
[58:37] when others are doubting amen the
[58:39] believer keeps on believing amen
[58:42] when others are doubting that's when
[58:43] you're starting to manifest faith amen
[58:46] when other people are worried and crying
[58:49] and
[58:50] upset about the situation amen you being
[58:53] different you are here to show that god
[58:54] is in control
[58:55] hallelujah amen glory to god
[58:59] if god is in control everything is going
[59:02] to be all right
[59:05] it don't matter if other things and
[59:07] aspects of the situation
[59:09] are looking all out of control if god is
[59:12] in control
[59:13] he's going to see to it that you are
[59:16] taken care of
[59:18] hallelujah when those three hebrew boys
[59:22] got put in the fiery furnace by the king
[59:24] that was supposed to be their friend
[59:26] the average person would have said it
[59:28] looks like things are out of control
[59:32] hallelujah but the bible lets us know
[59:35] that it was a fourth man that showed up
[59:37] in the fight
[59:38] and the fourth man that showed up in the
[59:40] fire showed that he
[59:42] had everything under his control
[59:46] even down to the fire he could change
[59:48] the chemistry
[59:49] of the fire to when they came out not
[59:52] even their clothes had the smell of
[59:53] smoke on it
[59:54] because almighty god had everything
[59:56] under his control
[1:00:00] hallelujah man when everybody else is
[1:00:03] getting weak hey
[1:00:04] man getting weak in faith hey man and
[1:00:06] people have been out of church so long
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] you know the longer you stay home the
[1:00:11] easier it is to keep staying home amen
[1:00:13] that's why i'm glad to see you out here
[1:00:15] this morning everything
[1:00:16] and if there's something that's out here
[1:00:17] listen amen and you don't got so
[1:00:19] comfortable staying home amen
[1:00:20] sometimes it's trying to come on out to
[1:00:22] the service again
[1:00:27] lord is blessed this amen he's kept this
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] he gave us some wisdom and some
[1:00:32] protocols and places and everything has
[1:00:34] been all right
[1:00:34] man and the scripture lets us know we
[1:00:37] don't forsake
[1:00:38] the assembling of ourselves amen and i
[1:00:40] ain't afraid to tell you what the bible
[1:00:41] said this morning hallelujah court of
[1:00:43] god
[1:00:45] when people are getting weaker amen we
[1:00:47] are showing that we are feeding on the
[1:00:49] word of god
[1:00:51] and getting stronger in this hour
[1:00:54] when people can't see past the natural
[1:00:57] and can't see past
[1:00:58] natural situations and natural
[1:01:00] circumstances and
[1:01:01] natural things moving through the land
[1:01:03] with the politics and the silver unrest
[1:01:05] say man we can look past the natural to
[1:01:07] the spiritual
[1:01:08] man because god has made us different
[1:01:11] he's wild as different
[1:01:12] he's called us with a different calling
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:15] how many love the lord this morning
[1:01:18] hallelujah
[1:01:19] amen now you know a lot of people in
[1:01:22] general they are
[1:01:23] proud to reflect where they are from
[1:01:25] even
[1:01:26] you know if somebody was maybe let's
[1:01:28] just say randley from texas or something
[1:01:30] they'd be proud to say i'm i'm from
[1:01:31] texas
[1:01:31] you know you might meet somebody from
[1:01:33] another country like germany maybe amen
[1:01:36] they proud to represent you know the
[1:01:38] fact that they're from
[1:01:39] a different country they're from a
[1:01:40] different place and even when i went
[1:01:43] down to college amen
[1:01:44] i started to recognize you know people
[1:01:46] started to to to really put an emphasis
[1:01:49] on recognizing where they were from
[1:01:52] and when i went down there down to
[1:01:53] florida i went to school in florida they
[1:01:55] were doing something that
[1:01:56] was unusual to me at the time they was
[1:01:59] representing where they were from
[1:02:01] even down to the county amen
[1:02:04] because i never heard anybody say you
[1:02:06] know i'm from columbia county uh
[1:02:08] richmond county are we from lexington
[1:02:09] county i never heard people talk like
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:12] when i got down to florida there was are
[1:02:14] we from dade county
[1:02:16] miami 305 we're from dade county huh are
[1:02:19] we from duval
[1:02:20] i mean jacksonville that's what you know
[1:02:23] i said why people are
[1:02:24] really glad to be from from that little
[1:02:26] county
[1:02:28] and what i started to realize is is it
[1:02:30] didn't matter where people were from
[1:02:32] even if you were from a little country
[1:02:33] holding the wall like green pond south
[1:02:35] carolina that's where i'm from
[1:02:37] and people are kind of proud to be able
[1:02:39] to identify where they're from
[1:02:41] people like to gravitate uh uh next to
[1:02:44] other people
[1:02:45] that that are from the same place that
[1:02:47] they're from even
[1:02:49] maybe when i was going to school in
[1:02:50] florida if i would meet somebody from
[1:02:52] south carolina we was instantly
[1:02:54] oh you're from south carolina yeah man
[1:02:55] i'm from south carolina too
[1:02:58] so man if they were from columbia
[1:02:59] greenville or whatever amen
[1:03:01] i had a lot of friends that was from
[1:03:02] south carolina because we could all be
[1:03:04] on one accord because we were from the
[1:03:06] same place
[1:03:09] but then every now and then you would
[1:03:11] meet somebody from the exact same town
[1:03:13] that you were from
[1:03:15] and what that would do if i met somebody
[1:03:17] from walterboro see that would bring it
[1:03:19] in
[1:03:19] even a little bit more closer amen
[1:03:22] because now we we are fully from the
[1:03:25] same place amen
[1:03:27] see will you from the same place you can
[1:03:29] identify with each other a lot better
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:32] see without being believed is a like
[1:03:34] precious
[1:03:35] faith amen the faith that i hold
[1:03:37] precious is the
[1:03:38] same faith that you all precious and not
[1:03:41] everybody else
[1:03:42] holds that faith precious but if the
[1:03:44] both of us are holding that same thing
[1:03:47] precious now that means that it means a
[1:03:49] lot to us amen
[1:03:51] and i can tell by you being here this
[1:03:53] morning at the word of god it means a
[1:03:55] lot to you
[1:03:56] and the same word that means a lot to me
[1:03:59] means a lot to you
[1:04:00] you know what that means that i mean
[1:04:02] we're gonna have a good time in the lord
[1:04:03] this morning
[1:04:06] that means we can all be on one accord
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:09] hallelujah even that song we were
[1:04:11] singing everywhere to worship on one
[1:04:13] accord
[1:04:14] it's hard to get the church going good
[1:04:16] and praising the lord
[1:04:18] if you got one half of the church maybe
[1:04:20] singing along and waving the hands
[1:04:22] and the other half of the church amen
[1:04:23] they got their arms folded like this
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:26] but we want to get our praise on one
[1:04:28] accord amen
[1:04:29] we want to have our spirit on one accord
[1:04:32] we want to have a mindset
[1:04:34] on one accord and if we're all in one
[1:04:37] accord then that's when the almighty god
[1:04:39] steps
[1:04:40] in and when he takes over
[1:04:43] the impossible becomes possible amen
[1:04:45] when he takes over there's nothing that
[1:04:47] cannot happen in the service amen
[1:04:51] you know one reason why people like to
[1:04:52] reflect where they're from
[1:04:55] is because where you from kind of mold
[1:04:57] you in a way man
[1:04:59] some people that was raised in a tough
[1:05:00] environment that thing molded them in a
[1:05:02] way to make them tougher and
[1:05:04] give them a different mindset about
[1:05:05] things and see the place that we are
[1:05:08] from amen
[1:05:09] is molding us it's giving us
[1:05:12] a different mindset amen
[1:05:16] almighty jesus christ said i've come
[1:05:18] from god amen
[1:05:20] i'm going back to god amen
[1:05:23] and when we talk about our same and the
[1:05:25] bible lets us know that we were made
[1:05:27] in his image and we were made and his
[1:05:30] likeness amen
[1:05:31] i'm just here to remind you that you are
[1:05:33] made in the very
[1:05:34] image and likeness of almighty god
[1:05:38] that's your heritage that's where you're
[1:05:41] from amen
[1:05:43] and what the prophet of god said brother
[1:05:44] branham said amen you're being made in
[1:05:46] his image and made in his likeness amen
[1:05:49] and god is a spirit amen so what did he
[1:05:52] do amen
[1:05:53] he made your spirit to be like his amen
[1:05:57] we ain't talking so much about this
[1:05:58] flesh man that has his ups and downs and
[1:06:01] his doubts and his faults and his
[1:06:03] players and he make mistakes from time
[1:06:05] to time amen
[1:06:06] sure that man has his things that he do
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:09] but there's a man on the inside of the
[1:06:12] inside
[1:06:13] and his reflection is exactly like that
[1:06:16] of his maker
[1:06:17] his reflection is exactly that of jesus
[1:06:20] christ
[1:06:23] that's what john said when we sin we'll
[1:06:25] be just like him
[1:06:26] can we see him as he is we'll see him
[1:06:30] through the word of god we wash him
[1:06:31] through the word of god
[1:06:32] we seeing him operate amen we seeing him
[1:06:35] bring things to pass that he said he
[1:06:38] would bring the passing
[1:06:40] we see him holding you when he said that
[1:06:42] he will hold him
[1:06:46] you know when you've manifested where
[1:06:47] you're from i mean there's a certain
[1:06:49] culture that you manifest where you're
[1:06:50] from amen
[1:06:52] there's a certain way that you walk
[1:06:53] there's a certain way that you talk amen
[1:06:56] your speech pattern is a giveaway where
[1:06:58] you from
[1:07:00] you know if i'm down in the low country
[1:07:02] and i start talking to some of the
[1:07:03] people like this and i say boy go and
[1:07:05] get some of that rice from over there
[1:07:06] man
[1:07:07] where people will start to identify what
[1:07:08] say much you must be uh get your boy
[1:07:10] like one of
[1:07:11] you boys from down there man that would
[1:07:13] identify me quickly where i'm from
[1:07:16] and if i don't want people to identify
[1:07:18] that that i'm from there i'll cover it
[1:07:20] up i'll talk a little bit more regularly
[1:07:23] when i start getting home and some of
[1:07:25] the other people around there they start
[1:07:26] talking like that a minute that i might
[1:07:28] get caught up but i might start talking
[1:07:29] like that cause we all from the same
[1:07:31] place
[1:07:34] see when we from the kingdom of god we
[1:07:35] speak a heavenly language amen
[1:07:38] we talk about the things that concern
[1:07:40] almighty god amen
[1:07:42] we we we we talk about us
[1:07:45] moving towards this kingdom almighty god
[1:07:47] has established amen
[1:07:49] we talk about the things of the spirit
[1:07:51] amen there's a lot of things in the
[1:07:53] flesh going on amen a lot of natural
[1:07:55] things going on lecture went on i mean
[1:07:56] that's fun to talk about sometimes amen
[1:07:58] super bowl today that's all right to
[1:08:00] talk about amen but you know somebody
[1:08:01] believe amen we like to talk about the
[1:08:03] things that god amen
[1:08:05] we like to manifest the things almighty
[1:08:08] god amen
[1:08:11] if he know if you know where you come
[1:08:13] from
[1:08:15] you know that you come from god you know
[1:08:17] that you're going back to god
[1:08:19] there's a lot of circumstances in the
[1:08:21] middle that we have to deal with in the
[1:08:22] meantime
[1:08:24] we know that all these things are going
[1:08:25] on around and same in civil unrest and
[1:08:27] the pandemic all those things amen
[1:08:30] but see because we know we come from and
[1:08:33] because we know we're going
[1:08:35] we got that great confidence in god in
[1:08:37] the meantime amen
[1:08:40] you know you find that this is a time
[1:08:42] and an age
[1:08:44] where people have placed their
[1:08:45] confidence
[1:08:47] and a lot of different things outside of
[1:08:50] jesus christ amen
[1:08:52] people have placed their confidence and
[1:08:54] a lot of
[1:08:55] different things outside of the word of
[1:08:57] god
[1:08:59] people have placed their confidence and
[1:09:01] whether trump would stay in or whether
[1:09:03] trump would get voted out amen
[1:09:06] and he saw the people that placed their
[1:09:07] confidence in trump amen their
[1:09:09] confidence was so broken that they
[1:09:11] they did something that seemed to be
[1:09:12] unthinkable that people were actually
[1:09:14] stoned the white house
[1:09:15] man a stone the capitol building rather
[1:09:17] than it's because they had their
[1:09:19] confidence placed in the wrong thing
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:23] and then there's people they mean they
[1:09:25] have their confidence so heavily placed
[1:09:28] and joe biden amen not understanding it
[1:09:30] ain't but so much body can do for them
[1:09:32] he got his own agenda amen
[1:09:35] he got his own daddy that he got the
[1:09:37] answer to
[1:09:39] call pope to call the pope because he's
[1:09:41] a catholic this morning we ain't afraid
[1:09:42] to say that
[1:09:45] so when you start to put your confidence
[1:09:48] in
[1:09:49] other things what you end up finding is
[1:09:51] that
[1:09:52] those things are end up failing you and
[1:09:54] me
[1:09:56] there's a lot of people they put so much
[1:09:58] confidence in the vaccine that's coming
[1:10:01] out amen
[1:10:03] i thank god for the vaccine amen if you
[1:10:05] ask me if you want the older ones go and
[1:10:06] take the vaccine that man not wrong with
[1:10:08] taking the vaccine amen
[1:10:09] but that's not all of our confidence in
[1:10:12] it man
[1:10:14] because people say if we get this
[1:10:15] vaccine that we have this thing to feed
[1:10:17] it we can go back doing everything like
[1:10:19] we want to do
[1:10:20] everything's going to be all right i'm
[1:10:22] here to tell you this morning
[1:10:23] that there's always going to be a
[1:10:25] certain sense of fear amen
[1:10:27] that things are never going to fully be
[1:10:28] the same again
[1:10:31] because even if that vaccine wiped
[1:10:33] things out completely and the best one
[1:10:34] is working at 95 percent the next one
[1:10:36] coming out is that 85 percent of johnson
[1:10:38] johnson what am i
[1:10:40] even if if it weren't even to his
[1:10:42] fullest amen it's still at five percent
[1:10:44] it's still at fifteen percent amen
[1:10:46] there's still the next thing that can
[1:10:47] come on down the road there's still a
[1:10:49] brazilian mutation a south african
[1:10:50] mutation amen
[1:10:51] so you can put your confidence in those
[1:10:53] things only but up to a certain extent
[1:10:59] you know some people put their
[1:11:01] confidence in getting another stimulus
[1:11:02] check amen
[1:11:04] according to god amen but if we get one
[1:11:07] more check
[1:11:08] we're gonna be all right
[1:11:11] and boy we get that next check oh man i
[1:11:14] mean it's tina what we do we're doing
[1:11:15] good feeling good
[1:11:17] and we got that last stimulus checked
[1:11:20] and we moved it to an uh
[1:11:22] a a new house that we bought but she
[1:11:24] ain't like the flaws in that house amen
[1:11:26] so y'all know what he was able to do
[1:11:27] with that chat we was able to get my
[1:11:28] wife the flaws that she wanted
[1:11:32] and she was so happy about it i said wow
[1:11:35] if i know that she would have been to
[1:11:36] everybody
[1:11:37] we would have did a long time ago
[1:11:40] but what i'm saying about that stimulus
[1:11:42] check as quickly as you get it
[1:11:44] it's gone into something amen and now
[1:11:46] you hoping for the next check amen
[1:11:49] and then one time they say we'll send
[1:11:50] you a check every month
[1:11:52] and that's all right but you know what
[1:11:55] happened if they start sending us a
[1:11:56] check every month and your light bill
[1:11:58] gonna go up
[1:11:58] your grocer's gonna go up baby because
[1:12:00] there's a there's a check and balance to
[1:12:02] all of these things they meant
[1:12:04] so i thank god for my stimulus but
[1:12:06] all my confidence isn't fully in that
[1:12:08] that's what i'm getting at this morning
[1:12:10] my confidence is the one amen who who
[1:12:13] stimulates me with the word amen
[1:12:15] whatever i have need of he lifts me up
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:19] he ain't gonna cut me off he's not gonna
[1:12:22] say i don't qualify for the benefit
[1:12:25] they can't vote in and vote out the plan
[1:12:27] to redeem me
[1:12:29] but i'm glad that this one he's stable
[1:12:32] he's sure he's secure
[1:12:36] and see if this mattress has been fully
[1:12:38] revealed to you
[1:12:40] nobody can take that away from you
[1:12:44] hallelujah it's a lot of people that was
[1:12:47] just going all along
[1:12:49] because mama went on along and daddy
[1:12:51] went all along
[1:12:52] and pats went on along and what we find
[1:12:55] out
[1:12:55] is that's not good enough it's got to be
[1:12:59] fully revealed to you personally as an
[1:13:02] individual
[1:13:04] and if it's been revealed to you amen
[1:13:08] you got full confidence in that thing
[1:13:10] amen hallelujah
[1:13:14] and that's why we can fight for the
[1:13:16] things of god like we do amen
[1:13:18] that's why we can fight against the
[1:13:20] devil like we do
[1:13:21] because whatever you got confidence in
[1:13:24] if you got enough confidence in it
[1:13:26] i mean to tell you this morning that
[1:13:28] you're willing to fight for it
[1:13:31] now you can't fight for anything that
[1:13:33] you don't fully believe in
[1:13:35] but if you fully believe in it you can
[1:13:37] dedicate yourself to it
[1:13:39] you're willing to turn yourself give
[1:13:41] yourself fully over to it
[1:13:43] because you got full confidence in the
[1:13:45] thing
[1:13:48] the bible lets us know it man there was
[1:13:50] a young man named david that came up on
[1:13:52] the scene
[1:13:53] and that same prophet samuel that i was
[1:13:56] telling you about at the beginning of
[1:13:57] the service
[1:13:59] here this prophet named samuel he had
[1:14:01] another purpose and calling in his life
[1:14:03] and that was to come and anoint david to
[1:14:05] be king
[1:14:07] and you know that annoying it was
[1:14:09] confusing to a lot of people at that
[1:14:11] point in time
[1:14:12] it was even confusing to david's own
[1:14:15] daddy
[1:14:17] david's own daddy said well out of all
[1:14:19] of my sons
[1:14:21] this is the one that they would want to
[1:14:22] be king
[1:14:25] but samuel was there to let them know
[1:14:28] that he wasn't a man that
[1:14:29] was just doing what the democrats said
[1:14:31] or just doing what the republicans said
[1:14:33] they mean
[1:14:34] sam was there to do a purpose of what
[1:14:36] almighty god said
[1:14:38] and if almighty god said anoint uh oh
[1:14:41] if if he would have told samuel to
[1:14:43] anoint a bullfrog to be king amen
[1:14:45] samuel would have did it amen because he
[1:14:47] knew that word came for the lord
[1:14:50] but nevertheless he anointed a little
[1:14:51] shepherd boy by the name of david to be
[1:14:53] king
[1:14:54] what happened as the story goes we know
[1:14:56] about goliath amen and after david slay
[1:14:58] goliath
[1:14:59] that that that that took the name of
[1:15:01] david from just being something people
[1:15:03] laughed at and snickered at so people
[1:15:05] started to sing songs about david
[1:15:08] people start the the whole david's name
[1:15:10] in high esteem because they
[1:15:12] they saw how the lord was with david and
[1:15:15] that great battle against goliath
[1:15:18] and what happened is the king that was
[1:15:20] there on the scene and there was already
[1:15:21] a king in place by the name assault
[1:15:24] and the bible lets us know that that
[1:15:26] saul got
[1:15:27] very jealous of david amen
[1:15:30] saul got very jealous of david a man
[1:15:32] these days caused
[1:15:34] david to have to run amen and hide him
[1:15:36] in
[1:15:37] and move from country to country and
[1:15:39] from place to place
[1:15:40] because saul was on david's track to try
[1:15:43] to kill david because maybe saul thought
[1:15:45] that he could do something to slow down
[1:15:47] the program almighty god
[1:15:50] but i'm here to tell you this morning if
[1:15:52] almighty god has called you
[1:15:54] to it there is not a devil
[1:15:57] in hell there's not a a
[1:16:01] virus there's not a pandemic there's not
[1:16:04] a social unrest amen
[1:16:06] that can keep you away from your promise
[1:16:09] if
[1:16:09] almighty god has anointed you for that
[1:16:12] promise
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:20] and david he kind of started out solo
[1:16:22] but as he went different places as you
[1:16:24] read through the story in samuel
[1:16:25] it was different men that recognized
[1:16:28] something david and
[1:16:29] they began to have confidence in david
[1:16:32] and say you know we're going to follow
[1:16:33] after him
[1:16:34] because i see something in him and it
[1:16:37] might have been unpopular at the time to
[1:16:39] a certain degree
[1:16:40] because saul had his army saul was
[1:16:43] trying to hunt them down
[1:16:44] like dogs amen but the more david went
[1:16:47] around
[1:16:48] the more the people started to link up
[1:16:51] with david amen
[1:16:52] the more that these men decided that if
[1:16:55] they were going to fight
[1:16:56] they were going to fight on the side of
[1:16:58] david's side
[1:16:59] they were going to fight for david it
[1:17:02] didn't matter what hockey was set up in
[1:17:04] place otherwise
[1:17:05] but they saw almighty god moving and
[1:17:07] they had
[1:17:08] confidence in that thing and because
[1:17:11] they had confidence in the call to david
[1:17:13] and they had confidence in the anointing
[1:17:15] of david they said you know what david
[1:17:17] we wanted to fight with you amen we will
[1:17:20] understand
[1:17:21] next to you you're not necessarily the
[1:17:24] king right now
[1:17:26] but we got a belief and confidence in
[1:17:29] you
[1:17:29] that you're coming into your throne that
[1:17:32] you
[1:17:32] coming in the power way man and david he
[1:17:36] didn't have an
[1:17:36] army he didn't have a crown he had all
[1:17:40] kind of equipment around him and all
[1:17:42] kind of soldiers just yet for them
[1:17:43] people to follow behind
[1:17:45] but one thing that david had was he had
[1:17:48] the anointing of almighty god
[1:17:50] and if you got the anointing of almighty
[1:17:52] god it don't matter what you do
[1:17:54] god you need to focus on what you do at
[1:17:58] the anointing the almighty god is able
[1:18:01] to
[1:18:02] cover amen it's able to be more than
[1:18:05] enough
[1:18:07] because god's anointing it never runs
[1:18:09] dry man it never falls short
[1:18:12] it's never not able to meet the
[1:18:15] challenge of the situation
[1:18:17] because it's his anointing i'm here to
[1:18:20] tell you this morning if almighty god
[1:18:22] has blessed you
[1:18:24] with his holy ghost simmons that is his
[1:18:26] anointing amen
[1:18:27] what did the prophet of god break down
[1:18:29] tell us what the holy ghost says
[1:18:30] that's you recognize the word for your
[1:18:33] day man
[1:18:34] that's you recognizing the word for your
[1:18:36] time period
[1:18:37] in the midst of 2021 those brothers they
[1:18:40] recognize the word for that data that
[1:18:42] was david we're going to follow behind
[1:18:43] it
[1:18:44] if you recognize the word for your day
[1:18:46] the revealed word of the hour
[1:18:48] that's the anointing of god amen and
[1:18:50] there's not a devil
[1:18:52] in hell that can stop the anointing of
[1:18:54] god amen
[1:18:55] i'm gonna love the lord this morning we
[1:18:57] ain't gonna keep you all morning
[1:18:58] hallelujah but the lord said it wasn't
[1:19:03] for everyone amen
[1:19:05] some people couldn't catch their mindset
[1:19:07] that they was going to be king
[1:19:10] they would still focus on saul how tall
[1:19:13] saul was
[1:19:14] how hams he was in the face amen how
[1:19:17] high his shoulders were
[1:19:18] was all nice and maybe that six pack he
[1:19:20] had amen they would still focus on the
[1:19:22] flat man
[1:19:24] maybe maybe saul was like uh march
[1:19:26] chestnut or sherman more of his time
[1:19:28] maybe
[1:19:29] they were still looking at the flesh we
[1:19:30] bringing up today michael b jordan of
[1:19:32] your time amen
[1:19:33] everybody looking at it oh man he looked
[1:19:35] like he needed to be king man
[1:19:37] he got had people uh with a specific
[1:19:39] anointing to be came
[1:19:41] and everybody couldn't catch that they
[1:19:42] were supposed to be king all they saw
[1:19:44] was a little ruddy boy that was running
[1:19:45] around amen
[1:19:47] and the lord in the scripture in the
[1:19:48] gospel of john he was telling us the
[1:19:51] same thing amen
[1:19:53] that he was from above but some are just
[1:19:56] from beneath amen
[1:19:57] they were reflecting where they fronted
[1:19:59] from beneath amen
[1:20:01] they were flooding their bloodline he
[1:20:03] said to them point blank you are of your
[1:20:05] father the devil
[1:20:08] that's a harsh thing to say but truth is
[1:20:11] truth
[1:20:13] truth is true and when you're dealing
[1:20:17] with people in this
[1:20:18] world amen and and you wonder why such
[1:20:20] and such did this thing like that and
[1:20:23] why would this person do that towards
[1:20:25] you why why would this person behave
[1:20:27] like that
[1:20:28] in this specific situation amen don't be
[1:20:31] confused
[1:20:32] with those things that man just had to
[1:20:34] understand that everybody is not a child
[1:20:36] of god
[1:20:37] they just reflect in their father where
[1:20:39] they came from and you
[1:20:40] can follow the devil as much as we like
[1:20:44] to preach and present presenting
[1:20:45] that it is for everybody at the end of
[1:20:47] the day sayings to be honest which is
[1:20:48] not for everybody even
[1:20:51] sometimes we witness the people and
[1:20:53] witness the people amen and even
[1:20:55] something as simple as water baptism in
[1:20:57] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:20:58] according to acts 2 38
[1:21:00] you think that would be a simple thing
[1:21:03] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:21:05] the lord jesus amen
[1:21:07] but still some people can't understand
[1:21:09] how that ties into these titles of the
[1:21:11] father son holy god
[1:21:12] man father is not a name amen
[1:21:15] son is not a name holy ghost is not a
[1:21:18] name amen you
[1:21:19] you know anybody with a reasonable
[1:21:21] understanding of the english language
[1:21:23] should be able to look and and see that
[1:21:26] what he was talking about in the name
[1:21:28] of the father son holy ghost said man
[1:21:30] that that name was lord jesus christ
[1:21:33] but everybody is not able to see it even
[1:21:37] and instead of you getting disappointed
[1:21:39] with their understanding man you got to
[1:21:40] understand
[1:21:41] it's not for everybody to understand man
[1:21:45] some things are not for everybody to
[1:21:46] understand
[1:21:49] brother brandon he uses john 8 when he's
[1:21:52] writing out the church age book and
[1:21:54] he's reading john 8 amen and and using
[1:21:57] that as an example
[1:21:59] and when he's talking about uh them
[1:22:02] being the father of the devil ave and
[1:22:04] and the lord being from above and then
[1:22:05] being from below amen
[1:22:07] but brahman said it's most evident from
[1:22:09] these scriptures
[1:22:10] that no man of himself can hear god amen
[1:22:14] that ability has to be given of god amen
[1:22:19] that's in the smyrna church agent you on
[1:22:21] your own can't hear god amen and that's
[1:22:24] not saying you on your own you can't
[1:22:26] hear god
[1:22:26] so you got to get the preacher you got
[1:22:27] to get the pope you got to get
[1:22:29] such-and-such
[1:22:29] no you on your own can't hear god unless
[1:22:32] almighty god tunes your ears for you to
[1:22:36] be able to hear almighty god
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:41] just like in matthew 17 when he was
[1:22:43] talking to peter it said flesh and blood
[1:22:44] have not revealed it unto you
[1:22:46] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:22:48] revealed this revelation tell you
[1:22:51] and brother brown he turns around and
[1:22:53] says that that we
[1:22:54] see in that that is only one
[1:22:58] very special group of people who are
[1:23:01] able to hear what the spirit says in
[1:23:04] each age
[1:23:05] there's only one special group of people
[1:23:07] that group
[1:23:08] has to be of god because the group that
[1:23:11] cannot hear
[1:23:13] is not a god amen and those are the ones
[1:23:16] that are
[1:23:16] baptized into the body those are the
[1:23:19] ones that
[1:23:20] received the holy ghost say man because
[1:23:22] those are the ones
[1:23:23] that recognize where they're from amen
[1:23:26] and they recognize
[1:23:27] where they're going hallelujah glory to
[1:23:30] god
[1:23:32] musicians y'all can come on out we're
[1:23:33] gonna keep you all morning
[1:23:36] here the lord is on the scene in the
[1:23:38] flesh
[1:23:40] and he's preaching to the people he's
[1:23:42] ministering to the people and
[1:23:44] hear these pharisees they've been
[1:23:45] looking for a way to trap them for a
[1:23:47] long period
[1:23:48] of time because they felt like this
[1:23:50] jesus christ
[1:23:51] he was too forgiving they felt like this
[1:23:54] jesus christ he was
[1:23:56] associating with too many people of a
[1:23:58] low standard
[1:24:00] they felt like this jesus christ he was
[1:24:02] out there with the publicans and
[1:24:03] and with the wine bibles and with the
[1:24:05] prostitutes and they said
[1:24:07] we're going to catch them now we're
[1:24:08] going to get them back to the letter of
[1:24:09] the law
[1:24:10] lord we caught in the very act of
[1:24:14] adultery
[1:24:18] and him being a holy god he would never
[1:24:20] deny the word
[1:24:21] he never said that what she was doing
[1:24:24] was not wrong amen
[1:24:26] he just said for her punishment amen
[1:24:29] the one of you that is perfect let you
[1:24:31] start with the punishment
[1:24:34] and all that did was reveal to them that
[1:24:36] none of them were perfect amen
[1:24:38] and people think god is the god of jesus
[1:24:40] christ and somebody man it was just a
[1:24:42] law kind of wiggle room hey man
[1:24:43] he told he asked him where were your
[1:24:45] accusers
[1:24:47] she looked right i said and i hear lord
[1:24:49] amen he said neither do i accuse you
[1:24:52] but go and sin no more don't get caught
[1:24:56] back
[1:24:56] up in the same day that took you down i
[1:24:59] forgive you but that don't necessarily
[1:25:00] mean
[1:25:01] i want you to continue in that way
[1:25:06] hear the lord preaching to those
[1:25:08] pharisees amen
[1:25:09] after this situation and see what they
[1:25:12] were doing
[1:25:13] they were hearing what he had to say but
[1:25:16] they couldn't
[1:25:17] understand what he had to say
[1:25:20] that's why he said to them why do you
[1:25:22] not understand my speech
[1:25:25] it's because you cannot hear my word
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:29] and why can you not hear my word because
[1:25:32] you got a different father
[1:25:34] and that's a heavy indictment but i'm
[1:25:37] here to tell you this morning say you
[1:25:38] can hear his speech
[1:25:40] if you can understand his word that's
[1:25:42] because he is your father amen
[1:25:45] that's because he he he's burger he's
[1:25:48] brought you into something
[1:25:49] that you always be able to walk in he's
[1:25:52] brought you into something
[1:25:54] that would never leave you or forsake
[1:25:56] you
[1:25:58] and all i'm here to do is remind you of
[1:26:00] that this morning
[1:26:01] to remind you that you came from
[1:26:03] someplace higher
[1:26:05] don't be trapped about it as well and by
[1:26:08] the things of the world
[1:26:09] you young sisters amen don't be
[1:26:11] disappointed because you got to dress
[1:26:13] different from the rest of the world
[1:26:16] almighty god
[1:26:17] made you different from the rest of the
[1:26:18] world
[1:26:20] embrace that because there's great
[1:26:22] blessing that comes with that
[1:26:25] there's great power that comes with that
[1:26:28] and whatever you do saints if you know
[1:26:31] where you're going
[1:26:33] if you know where you come from then act
[1:26:35] like you know where you come from
[1:26:38] act like you know where you're going
[1:26:39] amen act like you're marrying the king
[1:26:44] act like you reflect in the ways of the
[1:26:46] king
[1:26:47] hallelujah amen i'm gonna leave you with
[1:26:50] this
[1:26:50] amen bible tells us about esther man we
[1:26:53] know that esther amen she was called to
[1:26:55] be the queen
[1:26:56] esther had a natural beauty about her
[1:26:58] amen but the chamberlain still had to
[1:27:00] come in and teach her how to be the
[1:27:02] queen amen
[1:27:03] esther had a natural beauty but but she
[1:27:05] still had to learn
[1:27:06] how to conduct herself around the
[1:27:08] kingdom
[1:27:10] and as she learned those things and she
[1:27:12] learned how to carry
[1:27:13] herself a minute how to move with grace
[1:27:15] at the right time
[1:27:16] she knew how to say the right thing
[1:27:18] before the king
[1:27:20] man she reflected what she had been
[1:27:23] taught at man she reflected
[1:27:25] what she had been trained to do amen she
[1:27:26] reflected what her purpose and what her
[1:27:28] calling was
[1:27:31] you're here to reflect that you're a
[1:27:32] queen in this hour man you here to
[1:27:35] reflect
[1:27:35] that you come from a city whose building
[1:27:38] makers god
[1:27:39] we don't get caught up in all these
[1:27:41] political struggles amen
[1:27:43] we don't get caught up in in the spirit
[1:27:46] of racism that's moving all around the
[1:27:48] country amen
[1:27:50] because in this day and age i mean it's
[1:27:51] back and forth for me you got a lot of
[1:27:52] black people just as racist as a lot of
[1:27:54] those white folks out there that's
[1:27:55] racist
[1:27:56] man and that spirit is a can't say man
[1:27:59] because so many people have been done
[1:28:00] wrong for so long and what that does it
[1:28:03] allows a spirit and a root of bitterness
[1:28:06] to raise up in the people i mean because
[1:28:08] they've been done wrong amen
[1:28:10] and there's no denying that they've been
[1:28:12] done wrong
[1:28:13] and still getting done wrong but god is
[1:28:16] the god of grace it baby
[1:28:18] god is a god that shows that no matter
[1:28:20] how much wrong
[1:28:21] man has done you that he's still more
[1:28:23] than able to keep you
[1:28:25] he's still more than able to sustain you
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] he has a place amen that he because you
[1:28:32] came from almighty god
[1:28:34] he gonna keep you while you're here on
[1:28:35] this natural journey amen
[1:28:37] all the way up until we go back to
[1:28:39] almighty god amen
[1:28:40] and because we came from we know we're
[1:28:42] going back jay man and we know who's
[1:28:44] keeping us in the meantime
[1:28:45] how many love the lord this morning
[1:28:48] hallelujah

[1:29:28] anybody lord that's struggling this
