[27:43] infallible proofs
[27:45] father we thank you now as we look to
[27:48] you lord
[27:50] we love you we appreciate you we thank
[27:52] you god bless your word
[27:55] move flesh back out of the way god that
[27:57] you can get glory and praise
[27:59] in jesus wonderful name amen
[28:05] as we stand and for the word we
[28:08] continuing on with the message the right
[28:12] mental attitudes
[28:14] towards any divine promise
[28:17] will bring it to pass
[28:20] the right minute attitude towards the
[28:23] word of god
[28:25] in proverbs 23 and 7 it says
[28:30] proverbs 23 and seven
[28:34] for as he thinketh in his heart
[28:37] so is he
[28:41] eat drink says he
[28:44] unto thee but
[28:48] his heart is not with thee
[28:51] but god bless the reader's word you may
[28:53] be seated
[28:56] the right mental attitude
[29:00] we must amend
[29:03] the way we think
[29:06] affects what we say
[29:12] so our thoughts must be pure
[29:18] but they cannot be pure
[29:22] if in our spirit
[29:25] it's not right david said creating the
[29:28] me
[29:29] great in me a right spirit within
[29:33] amen because he realized his spirit had
[29:35] got off
[29:38] he had uh pursued another man's wife and
[29:45] had the other man killed but he said i
[29:48] acknowledge my transgressions
[29:50] my sins are fair ever before you
[29:54] so david need
[29:57] to get a right spirit i i need
[30:02] lord have mercy on me
[30:06] god i need my spirit
[30:10] to be right
[30:14] created in me i believe that
[30:18] david realized the status or the
[30:20] situation
[30:23] that he was in need
[30:28] of god's cleansing power
[30:32] he knew that he needed hyssop clean me
[30:34] up lord
[30:37] lord i need to be washed early
[30:41] i need a washing i need a cleaning
[30:45] somehow this attitude has gotten
[30:50] the foul brother and sister
[30:56] as he thinketh in his heart i said to
[30:58] the young people on tuesday
[31:01] depersonalize it
[31:05] and to personalize it was to say
[31:08] as i think in my heart
[31:11] so am i
[31:14] as i think in my heart so am i
[31:19] it's not the enemy that's without that
[31:22] defeats you but it's the enemy that's
[31:24] within
[31:28] our defeat comes from within for
[31:34] if you abide in me my word abide in you
[31:40] the devil cannot cross the bloodline
[31:46] he cannot penetrate the word of god
[31:52] and when he was was fortified by the
[31:55] word of god
[31:56] she didn't have to worry about the devil
[31:59] without
[32:02] this only amen when she began
[32:05] to think different
[32:09] when her thoughts began to turn and
[32:12] began to
[32:14] they might think on the things in which
[32:18] the enemy without they met was trying to
[32:21] get into her mind
[32:26] remember god's servant god prophesied
[32:29] the greatest god i ever fought is fought
[32:31] in your mind
[32:36] so you that are troubled amen and
[32:39] think that your enemy is without is
[32:42] something wrong
[32:46] because you are secured because you are
[32:49] under the blood
[32:52] and the enemy cannot penetrate the blood
[32:56] of jesus now
[32:59] we're not just talking about the
[33:01] chemistry blood
[33:03] but we're talking about the life the
[33:05] talk and the life
[33:07] that was in the blood you with me
[33:11] and that is the holy ghost
[33:15] that is the spirit of the living god
[33:19] so brother and sister
[33:23] as i think in my heart
[33:26] so am i
[33:30] we have a lot of problems
[33:34] and we're concerned about a lot of
[33:36] things
[33:37] but those things that without are not
[33:41] amen our problem but our problem
[33:45] is with ourselves
[33:48] because our greatest enemy
[33:53] itself as
[33:56] i think in my heart
[33:59] so am i
[34:02] so amen we have to
[34:06] let this mind be in you
[34:11] that was also in christ
[34:16] they could not do anything
[34:21] that would make jesus
[34:25] attitude change towards them
[34:30] no matter what came
[34:34] upon jesus they could not change
[34:37] his character
[34:42] he loved the world
[34:45] in spite of the world hating him
[34:50] he loved us when we were enemies
[34:53] in our minds by wicked white yet
[34:56] christ still loved us are you with me
[35:04] so enmity and hatred did not
[35:07] change the way god thought about you and
[35:11] i
[35:13] it's very simple and very easily
[35:17] that folks would think that their
[35:20] enemy is one another
[35:24] and not the enemy within
[35:28] so your greatest enemy is not those that
[35:32] talk about you those that you think
[35:37] do you wrong those that borrowed
[35:41] money did not pay back
[35:46] that's not your greatest enemy
[35:50] the enemy within
[35:53] it's what comes out of you determines
[35:58] who you are
[36:01] for you the tree is known
[36:05] by the fruits
[36:08] amen the attributes of god
[36:13] amen that we're concerned about the
[36:16] expression
[36:17] they meant that jesus was the express
[36:20] image
[36:20] of the invisible god
[36:24] and we must even express
[36:28] god's attributes in our lives
[36:35] saint john 1 as i
[36:39] said the right mental attitude towards
[36:43] the word
[36:45] the right mental attitude
[36:49] i find that
[36:53] about 99 of the problems in the church
[36:57] is because people themselves blame
[36:59] somebody else
[37:00] for their own attitude
[37:05] all the schisms and all the divisions
[37:08] and
[37:09] all of our troubles are not because amen
[37:12] somebody else calls it it because it
[37:15] meant
[37:16] the mental attitude that we have
[37:21] as i think in my heart so am i
[37:28] as i think in my heart so am i
[37:31] as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[37:36] are you with me so it's what comes out
[37:40] of the heart that is the thing that
[37:43] defies the man
[37:46] when we perceive evil thoughts
[37:51] amen we cannot allow evil thoughts to
[37:54] come
[37:55] and we perceive them and we amen
[37:59] uh digest them and we think on those
[38:03] things
[38:04] he said think on these things finally my
[38:07] brethren
[38:08] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[38:10] things are honest whatsoever things are
[38:12] lovely
[38:13] well amen oh god if there's any virtue
[38:16] of there'll be any praise think on these
[38:18] things
[38:19] but what the devil will divert and he'll
[38:23] move your thinking away amen for
[38:26] thinking
[38:26] on the things that god amen
[38:30] said to let your mind
[38:33] be in christ amen set your affections on
[38:37] things above
[38:40] the devil try to bring you down and make
[38:43] you wrestling but god is bringing you
[38:45] into his divine
[38:47] nature are you with me
[38:51] god is lifting you up the devil is
[38:53] trying to take you down in the gutter
[38:58] the devil attacks you into negativity
[39:01] but god is bringing the positive
[39:06] the devil have you thinking evil but god
[39:09] wants you to think
[39:10] good to overcome evil with good
[39:15] to love your enemies
[39:19] amen so the way we love is by
[39:23] separating ourselves and dividing
[39:25] ourselves
[39:26] and hating one another
[39:30] we love that's what we call pure love
[39:33] when we can have our our devices
[39:37] in and think good of ourselves because
[39:40] we're better than this one or we're
[39:42] better than that one
[39:44] and our attitude becomes up and
[39:47] lift up because we're more spiritual
[39:50] we're more holy
[39:51] and we're more godly
[39:55] brother and sister he said the strong
[39:59] ought to bear
[40:00] the infirmities of the weak
[40:03] if we're strong amen let's lift one
[40:06] another let's
[40:07] wake up not
[40:10] amen it causes us to go down
[40:14] and amen causes us to begin to be
[40:16] depressed
[40:18] and causes us to have pity parties
[40:21] because
[40:21] amen we figure amen i'm looking for love
[40:26] from without
[40:27] and not within i'm looking for somebody
[40:31] to love
[40:32] me amen when i cannot produce
[40:35] or give love
[40:39] love comes with it within not from
[40:42] without
[40:45] for he said greater is he that
[40:50] within you amen though the greater love
[40:54] has no man the gifts that he'll lay down
[40:58] his
[40:58] life for you
[41:03] are you with me so the great
[41:06] love even in the divine love
[41:10] and their god-paid love and god's love
[41:13] that's inside of the believer amen
[41:18] we have embraced amen
[41:21] the new creation the new man that is in
[41:25] christ
[41:26] jesus the new man that has
[41:30] new attributes that can walk
[41:33] amen in the spirit that can live in the
[41:36] spirit
[41:37] that can walk in the light that can
[41:39] produce
[41:40] imminent kindness gentleness meekness
[41:44] long suffering patience the new man has
[41:49] attributes
[41:50] that's on display amen that folks are
[41:54] seen
[41:55] but i'm gonna tell you the negative
[41:58] minded person
[41:59] no matter how good jesus was
[42:03] amen they still called him visible
[42:07] they meant the negative mind that
[42:10] does not see the goodness of god
[42:15] they would always show you the backside
[42:18] of israel
[42:20] they may they never show you the
[42:22] bleeding lamb the blood
[42:25] that was on the doorpost amen
[42:28] it'll never show amen but balaam
[42:32] wants to curse god's people
[42:35] amen he don't want god's people to be
[42:38] blessed
[42:39] what god told them whom i bless
[42:43] they are blessed and no man can crush
[42:46] you
[42:47] and i'm saying to you the right mental
[42:51] attitude
[42:52] if god before us
[42:56] then who can be against us
[43:01] amen so the enemy that
[43:04] you are fighting is not the outside
[43:07] enemy it's the inner person
[43:11] when you are not satisfied and happy
[43:15] because the bible says the joy of the
[43:18] lord
[43:19] is my strength
[43:23] and the kingdom of heaven coming not
[43:26] with other vation
[43:27] neither shall they say lo here alone
[43:30] there for the kingdom of heaven
[43:32] is within you
[43:36] amen and the kingdom of heaven is not
[43:40] meat and drink but it's righteousness
[43:44] peace and joy in
[43:48] not outside of the holy ghost but it's
[43:50] in the holy ghost
[43:53] amen get in the spirit
[43:56] amen we must get in the spirit
[44:00] the spirit amen the dwells in you
[44:04] get in the spirit
[44:07] god if i be lifted up
[44:10] i'll drown brother and sister just
[44:14] lift jesus up let jesus be magnified
[44:19] and glorified in your bodies
[44:23] oh let jesus have the preeminence in
[44:26] your life
[44:28] amen all the outside interference
[44:31] it's too long that we've agonized and
[44:35] wonder why this and why that and try to
[44:38] understand the outside but it's not the
[44:41] outside that we're dealing with
[44:43] we're dealing with the inside and inside
[44:47] of god
[44:49] tragedies remember that amen beyond our
[44:53] comprehension
[44:55] beyond all knowledge
[44:58] amen all wisdom god has struggles
[45:02] for you to have and be partakers of
[45:07] that divine nature thank y'all one i got
[45:10] to get there
[45:12] but i'm i'm just kind of caught up
[45:14] because
[45:15] the right mental attitude
[45:19] it's it it's too often
[45:22] that we're actually
[45:26] blaming somebody else for our own
[45:28] unhappiness
[45:30] why we don't have peace and why we don't
[45:32] have joy
[45:33] amen if you don't have it then you don't
[45:35] have the holy ghost
[45:38] amen if you're not if you don't have
[45:40] happiness and you don't have
[45:42] joy and you don't have peace he said my
[45:44] peace i give to you
[45:46] now who took it from you not as the
[45:49] world give give i you
[45:52] amen no man is able to pluck you out of
[45:55] my hand
[45:57] nobody can take god's the joy that i
[46:00] have
[46:00] the world i said the world didn't
[46:05] the world didn't give it in the world
[46:09] isn't that right if the world didn't
[46:12] give it to you the world can't take it
[46:15] but some folks are sitting around
[46:17] mumbling and grumbling and complaining
[46:19] about their status and their spiritual
[46:22] state
[46:22] and their own welfare amen and they're
[46:25] talking about
[46:26] amen oh lord why did
[46:30] amen such a soul brother oh amen
[46:34] oh lord so it's so unsad
[46:38] and why did they do this and i believe
[46:41] the day of this and they are that
[46:44] don't you go running off and they make
[46:46] your own little private
[46:48] vendetta you got to realize
[46:51] who are you whatever you're
[46:55] thinking whatever you're giving out so
[46:58] is as i
[47:01] think in my heart what so what i think
[47:05] about
[47:06] you amen as i think
[47:09] whatsoever man's soul
[47:12] that shall he also reap
[47:16] so he's thinking and he's reaping that
[47:19] so he's actually exercising
[47:21] what he's thinking his thoughts he's
[47:24] acting out
[47:25] on his thoughts and the reason why he
[47:28] cannot speak to you
[47:30] he had to separate himself from you is
[47:33] because
[47:34] his insecurity from within is not
[47:37] without
[47:40] amen love will cover what
[47:43] a multitude of sin amen
[47:47] love amen praise god that is stronger
[47:51] than death
[47:52] isn't that right so we must have
[47:56] the strong one inside of us
[48:00] amen we're coming to a place let me get
[48:03] there
[48:05] i'll just uh skip over and just go right
[48:08] to that verse the 12th verse
[48:10] but as many as
[48:14] for as many as received him to them gave
[48:18] me powers
[48:19] to what become
[48:24] the sons of god
[48:29] even to them that believe on his word
[48:34] see i want to take it from the
[48:38] attitude uh uh from this
[48:41] perspective from the respect
[48:44] the power to become
[48:50] you have power to become the sons of god
[48:53] by receiving him now whether the icon
[48:57] becomes an oak tree it determines
[49:02] amen it determines on the condition
[49:08] amen and some conditions might
[49:11] start the growth
[49:16] it's whether or not things could block
[49:21] the icon from becoming the oak tree
[49:26] a baby
[49:29] one baby young baby girl can become
[49:36] a woman
[49:39] a baby boy can become
[49:43] a young man
[49:47] are you with me but
[49:51] the power to become
[49:56] i'm talking about from baby to maturity
[50:02] i'm talking about amen from posture to
[50:05] complete
[50:08] from partial reality
[50:11] to a full reality
[50:15] are you with me i'm talking about
[50:19] that which is in part
[50:22] being done away with when that which is
[50:26] perfect it's come are you with me
[50:31] so i'm saying power to become some of us
[50:35] amen
[50:39] many had received him
[50:42] to him that them gave you power
[50:47] to become the sons of god
[50:51] but whether you become a son or daughter
[50:53] god is up to you
[50:56] the power is available if you believe
[51:01] but whether you become or not
[51:04] and it's up to you
[51:08] recognize who you are
[51:11] and whom you have received
[51:16] amen it's what amen you have in the
[51:20] inside
[51:22] amen that wants to materialize
[51:27] and come in the very image and the
[51:29] fullness of christ
[51:32] unto the statute of a perfect man
[51:36] so maturity lies within the seed
[51:42] but only through suffering
[51:46] that we bring forth perfection
[51:50] are you with me not the trying of your
[51:54] faith working
[51:55] patience but you must let
[51:59] patients have a perfect word
[52:02] that you may be perfect hallelujah
[52:06] god wants to bring you to maturity he
[52:09] wants to complete
[52:11] what he begun the
[52:14] effort bride or the effort church
[52:17] becoming the omegle
[52:22] the seed that went down in the ground
[52:25] the foundation that were laid by paul
[52:30] the foundation stone and the headstone
[52:33] they meant one
[52:36] are you with me for
[52:40] faith and love coming together
[52:44] the cap the bride into
[52:47] that statue of a perfect man
[52:51] but in the process of moving from
[52:54] faith amen to charity
[52:58] amen you must go through virtue
[53:02] amen you must understand temperance and
[53:05] patience and knowledge
[53:07] and the different aspects of the
[53:09] attributes of god
[53:12] jesus was born a little baby
[53:15] in a manger but at 33 years
[53:20] at 30 years old he stepped in to join
[53:25] and the holy ghost came down in the body
[53:28] shape
[53:29] of a dog and a voice said this
[53:32] is my beloved son at whom i'm pleased to
[53:36] dwell
[53:38] it must come a time of adoption
[53:42] oh you will be god is bringing you
[53:47] an eye into a place of adoption
[53:51] the placing of the sun
[53:55] power to become
[53:58] brother and sister there must be an
[54:01] urgency inside of us
[54:04] as the world is coming to his end
[54:07] that must be oppressing a groaning in
[54:09] the inside
[54:11] because we are looking at something
[54:14] the power to become
[54:18] as i think in my heart
[54:23] so am i what i think about you so am i
[54:30] what i speak about you so am i
[54:35] so good seed
[54:38] i said so good seed
[54:42] are you with me sow it on good ground
[54:47] and it'll bring forth

[55:02] skip over a whole lot of things because
[55:05] i don't mean to hold you along
[55:07] but by the grace of god we're on a
[55:11] journey
[55:13] our vision and our attention
[55:17] and our focus must be looking at
[55:19] something
[55:21] we must visualize and we must amen
[55:25] the bible says in the days of noah ever
[55:28] and my imagination and thought of man's
[55:31] heart was continually evil
[55:34] are you with me but we want to
[55:41] our thoughts and our imagination to be
[55:43] holy
[55:45] we want to meditate on his word
[55:48] and we want to think on the things
[55:50] that's going to cause us
[55:52] amen to walk into the dimension of
[55:54] perfect love
[55:55] and that the zoe life of god could come
[55:58] down
[55:58] and express the attributes out of the
[56:01] light
[56:03] that's inside of us the rainbow amen
[56:06] covenant of god
[56:08] but that rainbow amen began to express
[56:11] from those lightsabers and express
[56:15] amen what god is calling for amen is a
[56:18] complete
[56:19] amen covenant in this hour that he made
[56:22] that you and i
[56:23] and that's why he meant he had a rainbow
[56:26] amen on his head
[56:27] amen praise god hallelujah
[56:31] clothed with the sun amen and the moon
[56:34] underneath me i'm saying it's time to
[56:37] realize
[56:38] that the son of a righteousness arrives
[56:41] with healing in his wing
[56:42] come down he met he meant praise god the
[56:45] mighty angel comes off of heaven clothed
[56:48] in a cloud
[56:49] and a rainbow a rainbow a covenant with
[56:53] you and i
[56:54] and as he puts one feet on the earth and
[56:57] one on the sea
[56:58] amen he made a cry
[57:02] amen and seven thunders out of their
[57:05] voices
[57:06] and when the seven understand us out of
[57:08] their voices i was about to write
[57:11] amen and he said the child seal it up to
[57:14] the time of the
[57:15] end but brother and sister amen
[57:18] the time of the end has come
[57:22] and the covenant people must be on the
[57:25] scene
[57:26] to receive the new covenant life
[57:29] that which he purchased he's come to
[57:31] claim
[57:33] they meant by coming down
[57:36] amen in descending in a shout out

[57:44] the call of people out of revelation 18
[57:47] come out of her my people
