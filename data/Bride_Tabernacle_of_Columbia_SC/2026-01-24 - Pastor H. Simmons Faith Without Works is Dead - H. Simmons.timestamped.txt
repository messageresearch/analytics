[34:27] Woolley. Lord, continue to touch him.
[34:30] Lord, oh God, may Oh God, you give him a
[34:34] miracle upon miracles that you've
[34:36] already wrote, Lord. But we ask you to

[34:40] Father. Oh God, THE THINGS THAT THE
[34:43] DARKNESS CAN'T HELP, LORD. BUT YOU, GOD,
[34:45] THE MIRACLE WORKER, FATHER. So we look
[34:48] to you tonight in Jesus name.
[34:51] PRECIOUS BROTHER BARNES TONIGHT, LORD.

[35:07] GOD THAT YOU TOUCH THEIR BODIES, LORD.
[35:10] PRAY GOD THAT YOU MOVE UPON YOUR PEOPLE,

[35:46] TRIBULATIONS LORD FATHER HELP THEM now
[35:49] in Jesus name we pray.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] The question is
[36:01] why?
[36:03] Why won't we serve? And the prophet
[36:05] spoke a sermon. Why? I don't know what's
[36:08] wrong. The book of James, the 2 chapter,
[36:12] the 14th verse. We thank God again for
[36:17] his word.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; May his word have preeminence tonight.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Said, "What does it profited my
[36:25] brethren? Though a man say he has faith
[36:29] and have not works. The question is can
[36:32] faith what?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Save him.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Can faith save him?
[36:38] If a brother or sister be naked and
[36:41] destitute of daily food,
[36:44] and one of you say unto them,
[36:48] Depart in peace, be ye warm and filled.
[36:52] Notwithstanding ye give them not those
[36:56] things which are needful
[37:00] to the body,
[37:03] what does it profit?
[37:06] Even so
[37:08] faith
[37:09] if it has not what
[37:12] &gt;&gt; it is what
[37:14] &gt;&gt; being alone.
[37:18] Yay.
[37:19] A man may say that thou has what?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; And have not what?
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Words.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Show me thy faith without what?
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And I will show thee my faith by what?
[37:36] &gt;&gt; By works.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Thou believeth that there is one God.
[37:40] Thou doeth well. The demons are the
[37:43] devils believe also. And what? Tremor,
[37:48] &gt;&gt; tremor.
[37:51] But
[37:53] will thou know, oh vain man, that faith
[37:59] without
[38:03] &gt;&gt; faith without what?
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Works is dead.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. May be seated. God
[38:09] bless the word.
[38:12] Faith without works is what?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Dead.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Dead. Amen. Praise God. Do you want a
[38:18] dead faith?
[38:22] You know,
[38:24] sometimes we
[38:27] we simply
[38:29] just says, "I'm a believer."
[38:33] But there's no action.
[38:36] Faith has action.
[38:40] Faith produces
[38:44] works.
[38:46] So, uh, we'll go to Romans 3.
[39:08] Here he says in 28,
[39:12] therefore we conclude that a man is
[39:15] justified by what?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Faith without the deeds of the what?
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Law.
[39:23] Without the deeds of the law.
[39:28] It says,
[39:30] "Is he that is he the God of the Jews
[39:35] only? Is he not also of the Gentiles?
[39:39] Yes, the Gentiles also. Seeing it is one
[39:43] God
[39:45] which shall justify the circumcision by
[39:49] faith and the uncircumcision through
[39:52] faith.
[39:54] Do we then make void the law through
[39:58] faith? God forbid. We establish the law.
[40:05] So here
[40:08] we have James speaking and we have Paul
[40:10] speaking.
[40:12] Paul speaking.
[40:14] He says
[40:17] a man is justified by faith without the
[40:20] what? The deeds of the law. Without the
[40:24] deeds of the law.
[40:26] And James says faith without works
[40:29] is dead.
[40:33] So by the grace of God, we want to look
[40:36] at it from the perspective
[40:39] that as we going on back to James, we
[40:43] want to look on faith without works is
[40:45] dead. A lot of times people when they
[40:48] get saved, they just sit back and relax.
[40:53] They get saved, said, "I gave Jesus my
[40:55] life, my heart, and they just sat back
[40:59] and relax, and they want to ride on into
[41:02] heaven.
[41:04] Let's just go to heaven. You know, I'm
[41:08] justified by faith. I got peace with God
[41:10] through our Lord Jesus Christ. I can go
[41:12] into heaven." But we had those that
[41:16] Excuse me. I I better stay in Galatian.
[41:19] Galatian uh for a moment. Galatians 5.
[41:26] There was a question with those Jews and
[41:30] Paul was dealing with the Jews
[41:33] that have come out of Jud Judaism under
[41:36] the law and come into grace. And he was
[41:38] dealing with those folks and to deal
[41:41] with them because a lot of those people
[41:44] were leaning back to put upon the
[41:48] Gentiles. They wanted them to be
[41:50] circumcised because the Jews had to be
[41:52] circumcised and they had the law of
[41:53] Moses. And having the law of Moses, they
[41:56] wanted the the Gentiles to come under
[41:58] the law. And the Gentiles had come to
[42:03] God through faith.
[42:05] And they had to believe on the Lord
[42:07] Jesus Christ and the redemption that was
[42:10] through the cross. That's why Paul says,
[42:12] "I come knowing not nothing among you
[42:15] save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[42:17] And he was saying that uh he was
[42:21] preaching that Christ was crucified for
[42:23] us. Then he was talking about receive
[42:25] you the spirit by the works of the law
[42:27] or by the hearing of faith. So it was
[42:29] faith. He put a lot of emphasis on faith
[42:32] where the Jews in turn had put a lot
[42:35] emphasis on the law. The law of Moses.
[42:38] Amen. And so James was talking about the
[42:42] faith were not works. So he was talking
[42:45] about not the works of the law, but he
[42:48] was talking about the works that
[42:50] followed
[42:51] of faith
[42:53] of the gospel. So we're looking at the
[42:56] law of Moses and we're looking at the
[42:57] gospel.
[42:59] We're looking at the law of faith. Amen.
[43:03] That it produces if we really believe
[43:07] God, it will produce works.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; But here are people who say, "Well, I
[43:12] believe THE GOSPEL. THAT'S IT. Simply we
[43:15] find that uh that the Lutheran
[43:20] and the Reformation
[43:22] they believe
[43:24] because they had come out of Catholicism
[43:26] and they had justification. The just
[43:28] shall live by faith
[43:30] and they thought that that was it. So
[43:33] there was no further.
[43:36] They didn't go on to sanctification and
[43:38] they didn't go on to the baptism of the
[43:40] Holy Ghost.
[43:42] They just stop with the just believing
[43:47] and accepting Jesus Christ. I think a
[43:49] lot of people in their journey
[43:52] they
[43:55] use the gospel for law. They use the
[43:59] gospel of Jesus Christ and a a lot of
[44:02] people feel like they've been in
[44:03] bondage. So he says here, "Stand fast in
[44:07] the liberty where Christ has be made you
[44:09] free and be not entangled again with the
[44:12] yoke of bondage."
[44:15] So he was talking about the yolks of
[44:17] bondage. So what yoke of bondage? He
[44:20] says, "Behold
[44:23] uh Paul, I Paul say unto you that if you
[44:27] be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
[44:30] what?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing."
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing. So in other words, h the the
[44:36] people believe that we're serving God
[44:38] and we going to be justified by the law.
[44:41] And if we do what and a lot of people
[44:44] come to church, you can't do this, you
[44:46] can't do that. And if you do this, you
[44:48] you're not uh saved, you're not a
[44:50] message believer, you're not a
[44:52] Christian. And and and they look at you
[44:54] like that. And a lot of people look at
[44:57] the dos and don'ts, the dos and don'ts
[45:00] of right sometimes even in the gospel.
[45:04] But it must be something that uh is
[45:07] activated in you.
[45:10] Not because the church what the church
[45:12] stand for, what the message stand for.
[45:14] It's something that what the Holy Ghost
[45:17] &gt;&gt; see if I I I said if you ever get if the
[45:20] people ever get the love of God in their
[45:22] heart, you won't have to worry about
[45:24] telling them how to dress.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Hey, you know that
[45:29] dress too short. That dress too tall.
[45:31] that dress got to split up too high.
[45:34] That's just you got to tell them all
[45:35] that kind of stuff. Hey, what you doing?
[45:39] You know what I'm saying? You got to all
[45:41] that correction. But if they get the
[45:42] love of God, the spirit will lead them.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; It will bring conviction and
[45:46] condemnation.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not the law that we
[45:51] talking about under the gospel is a law
[45:53] of love.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you love God. that you've
[45:58] come into a personal relationship where
[46:00] you can be led by the spirit of God.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; But here, Amen. It it it becomes a law.
[46:08] Amen. If you leave this church, you're
[46:10] going to hell.
[46:12] That's the nicolating spirit. I if you
[46:15] walk out of here, something bad going to
[46:16] happen to you. And you know that that's
[46:19] the kind of nicolate. Once you hear that
[46:21] and once you hear the control of the
[46:23] people, you know that's the doctrine of
[46:26] the nickel. Are you with me?
[46:29] &gt;&gt; It ought you ought to serve God with a
[46:31] freedom with a liberty.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And that liberty ought to be love.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; But when you become fearful and scared
[46:39] if I leave the church, I might get a
[46:41] heart attack. I might get sick.
[46:43] Something bad going to happen to me. You
[46:45] know you the church physically, the
[46:48] building, the preacher. Amen. I'm scared
[46:51] of that preacher. He might say
[46:52] something. Oh, come on. It ought to not
[46:55] be a fear that I'm scared of God. I'm
[46:57] scared to go to hell. But I got a
[46:59] relationship. I fell in love with him.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people said, "I'll leave that
[47:04] I leave my husband, but I can't leave
[47:06] him because the law said,
[47:09] you know, I got married and I said do
[47:11] the law the death do, but I don't love
[47:14] him no more. So I but I'm bound by the
[47:17] law
[47:19] that stay here and to tough it out
[47:21] because I I I don't love him no more. I
[47:24] don't love her no more. But I'm bound by
[47:26] the law." It ought to not be a law that
[47:31] holds you together. It ought to be love
[47:32] that holds you together.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; It ought to not and see uh um that's
[47:37] what people Amen. You can preach the
[47:40] gospel and you can preach it in a way
[47:43] that people become in bondage.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Or you can preach the gospel where the
[47:50] people know that I'm free. Amen.
[47:55] Okay.
[47:58] He said, "Stand fast in the living where
[48:00] Christ has made you free. And be not
[48:02] entangled again with the yoke of
[48:04] bondage.
[48:06] Be behold I Paul saying unto you that if
[48:09] you be circumcised, Christ should profit
[48:11] you nothing. For I testify
[48:15] again to every man
[48:19] that is circumcised that he is a debtor
[48:23] to do the whole law."
[48:26] Some people they're scared, you know. I
[48:28] I think the church would have been how I
[48:31] mean filled up with people if I just
[48:33] told all the sisters, y'all wear a hat
[48:34] on your head. Y'all just put a hat on
[48:38] and y'all keep that hat on for the It's
[48:41] a group of people. The only reason they
[48:43] ain't coming to this church cuz you
[48:45] ain't got no hat on your head. But if
[48:47] you put a hat on your head,
[48:50] we can win a whole lot of people because
[48:52] you put a hat on your head. Cuz they
[48:54] believe that that hat is almost like uh
[48:59] uh uh it it's going to make them holy.
[49:01] It's a law that you got to do that. You
[49:04] see what I'm saying? And they believe
[49:06] they got it's almost like it put power
[49:09] in you. So I I I I'm saying don't let a
[49:15] doctrine issue uh uh even though if even
[49:18] though if if it was Bible but we know
[49:21] our hair is given to her for a covering
[49:24] and if she have long hair it is glory to
[49:26] her.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So so by the grace of God we we you if
[49:34] you know the truth the truth will make
[49:36] you free.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; But
[49:42] I you know the gospel is going God going
[49:45] to give you the opportunity.
[49:47] Amen. If you say you have the love of
[49:49] God in your heart, he's going to give
[49:51] you the opportunity
[49:53] to display and to manifest. That's why
[49:56] James says, "Show me your faith and I'll
[49:58] show you my works."
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The way I walk, the way I live,
[50:03] the way I conduct my life, I'll show
[50:05] you. Are you with me? Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; But you know uh uh many times people
[50:12] amen are trying to live the life of a
[50:15] Christian without the love of God
[50:17] dwelling in them.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Until Christ get inside of you. That's
[50:21] what gives you the liberty.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; When the love of God comes in your
[50:26] heart, it gives you a liberty. And it's
[50:29] not a a a a duty. It's not a work. It's
[50:33] it it's faith.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your faith. Amen. Is is not only
[50:38] it's his faith and it's a gift that God
[50:42] gives you. It's one of the uh fruits of
[50:44] the spirit is faith.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, I got to get down to the verse I
[50:49] was trying to get to, but
[50:52] it says in the fourth verse, and Christ
[50:55] has become of no effect to you,
[50:59] whosoever of you are justified by the
[51:02] law, you have fallen from what?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Grace. You're falling from grace. Now,
[51:07] we're talking about the law of Moses
[51:09] back then, but we're just talking about
[51:10] the law of the church right now. You can
[51:14] get in,
[51:16] you can get in a church that's supposed
[51:18] to be a gospel believing church, but yet
[51:21] you got so many laws and dos and don'ts
[51:23] that the young people never knew that I
[51:26] I I'm living this life because of
[51:28] Warner.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Because I love him.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And until you fall in love with
[51:33] God, you going to always believe that
[51:36] you you walk out of here and they had me
[51:38] where I couldn't do this and I couldn't
[51:40] do that. And and they had me in bondage.
[51:45] And and you know, you're raised in the
[51:47] parents, you're not you're not going to
[51:48] do this in my house. You're not going to
[51:50] do that. If you go you do that now, you
[51:52] getting out of here.
[51:54] You know, it's real strict. It's real
[51:57] teachers and, you know, real hard and
[51:59] tough. Amen. So the children live, Amen.
[52:04] They live under insecurity.
[52:07] Their security is not with God. Amen. It
[52:10] becomes their security becomes their
[52:12] parents. It becomes the church. It
[52:13] becomes the preacher. But your security
[52:16] ought to be I'm secured in the love of
[52:18] God.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I know he loves me and I
[52:21] love him.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I know he died for my sins and Amen. And
[52:25] he set me free from the sin and bondage.
[52:28] Amen. and his love. Amen. I receive the
[52:32] love of God in my heart.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when it becomes a dos and
[52:38] don't salvation.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:41] Not that some you ought not to, you
[52:44] know, you ought to not lie. You ought to
[52:46] not steal. You ought to not commit
[52:47] adultery or fornication. You ought not
[52:49] to do those things, right?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Because if you got the love of Christ in
[52:53] your heart, you don't
[52:56] &gt;&gt; you don't desire to do those things.
[52:59] It's a because of a lack of the love of
[53:01] God in your heart.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you really love your husband
[53:05] and love your wife, you just wouldn't do
[53:07] those things.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Because you love her, you don't wouldn't
[53:11] want to hurt her.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because of you know once
[53:16] Amen. the love of God constrains you.
[53:20] Once the love of God is in you and you
[53:21] have that relationship with him and that
[53:24] confidence and the trust. Amen. I trust
[53:26] in God.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though I cannot keep myself,
[53:31] even though I don't have the ability to
[53:34] save myself, he saved me and he's the
[53:37] one that's keeping me.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't save myself. Neither
[53:41] can I keep myself. BUT I'M KEPT BY THE
[53:44] POWER OF GOD.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And because of his power, I'M
[53:48] KEPT.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE OF his love, I'm saved.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; HIS LOVE FOR ME.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; I'm saved. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he loved me. How about you?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad he cared about me. Praise
[54:03] God. When I didn't care about him, he
[54:05] cared about me.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; It makes a difference.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; The love of God makes a difference.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you walking by sight and
[54:18] not by faith, you don't understand the
[54:21] love of God. Because all you seeing and
[54:24] once you uh once you uh counterminded
[54:28] and once you Amen got a mind
[54:33] of the world and it might be
[54:34] intellectual and you know how to reason
[54:36] with the uh gospel of Jesus Christ
[54:39] reason why you don't do this and why you
[54:41] don't do that and and you know we don't
[54:44] we don't want to take your liberty away
[54:46] from you. We want you just to get deeper
[54:49] in the love of God. I says, you know,
[54:52] we've been preaching hard against this
[54:54] and hard against that. It comes to just
[54:57] about war. The prophet said, I go
[55:00] through the country and I preach against
[55:01] this and preach against that and come
[55:04] back and it's worse than it was.
[55:07] And I I said, you know, I said, I
[55:10] understand him good. You can preach your
[55:12] heart out against all kind of stuff and
[55:15] you're still dealing with the same
[55:17] thing. And I come to the conclusion, you
[55:19] got to love God.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; In order to stop sinning and stop doing
[55:23] the things of the world, you got to love
[55:26] him.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And and if you love God, we ain't got no
[55:29] trouble with you.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you don't love and you
[55:33] say, "Why I can't do this? Why I can't
[55:35] do that? Why I can't go here? Why I
[55:36] can't do that?" Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; You can.
[55:41] God didn't never keep you from doing it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; You see, you choose. I set before you
[55:47] life and death. You make your own
[55:48] decisions.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Still ain't got there.
[55:57] But I get back over here. Amen.
[56:01] You're fallen from grace. Fifth verse.
[56:03] For we through the spirit waited for the
[56:07] hope of righteousness
[56:11] by what?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; By faith. We through the spirit
[56:17] waited for the hope of righteousness by
[56:19] faith.
[56:22] He became sin for us
[56:24] &gt;&gt; that we might be made the righteousness
[56:26] of God through him.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not our own righteousness.
[56:35] It's what? The righteousness that he
[56:38] gave us that's only in Christ Jesus.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; And how do we get in Christ? by one
[56:44] spirit or we baptized into one body.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; We're children of God by what? By faith
[56:50] in Christ Jesus. For as many of us have
[56:52] been baptized into Christ have what?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Have put on Christ.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So when you put on the Lord Jesus
[57:00] Christ, it's not you no more. Amen. For
[57:04] Paul says, I I I'm crucified with
[57:06] Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I,
[57:09] but what?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Christ. Christ liveth in me. So the one
[57:13] that's supposed to be living is not you
[57:15] anymore. You have a struggle as long as
[57:18] you living.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; But the struggle is over when you become
[57:23] dead.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Colossians said I when we become dead in
[57:28] Christ and our life is hid in what?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Christ in God.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the life that I now live I live
[57:38] by the faith of son the son of god who
[57:40] gave himself what for me
[57:43] &gt;&gt; so here is amen and the kind of faith
[57:47] now you you don't have the the faith the
[57:50] h the law what the laws require you you
[57:54] have the faith of the son of god
[57:57] &gt;&gt; amen that's the kind of you have Jesus
[58:00] kind of faith
[58:01] &gt;&gt; it's Jesus in you
[58:04] &gt;&gt; it's Jesus in me.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the Jesus that's doing
[58:09] it.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm walking. Amen. But I'm walking
[58:12] in the spirit.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Praise. I'M WALKING BY FAITH,
[58:17] &gt;&gt; NOT BY SIGHT.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S THE GLORY GOD. IT'S THE HOLY
[58:21] GHOST MOVING.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; UNTIL THE HOLY GHOST CAN TAKE A HOLD OF
[58:25] YOU.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T GET THE HOLY GHOST UNTIL
[58:28] YOU FALL IN love with him.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can feel good and you can
[58:32] Amen. FEEL EMOTIONAL THRILLS. AMEN. BUT
[58:36] SOMETHING GOT TO HIT DOWN DEEP IN YOUR
[58:38] SOUL.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S GOT TO GO DEEP ENOUGH.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF GOD GOT TO COME. AMEN. SO
[58:44] DOWN IN YOUR SOUL THAT SOMETHING RISE UP
[58:47] IN YOU. AMEN. AND IT'S A POWER OF GOD
[58:50] &gt;&gt; THAT TAKES OVER.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S IN CONTROL.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And to that power. Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise God.

[59:41] God, something to something break in the
[59:44] spirit realm. THE SUPERNATURAL GOD

[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a supernatural faith.
[59:54] Praise God. We need something. Amen.
[59:56] that we can walk above the things of the
[59:58] world and live above the things of the
[1:00:01] world. PRAISE GOD. THE POWER OF GOD

[1:03:49] sixth verse for for in Jesus Christ
[1:03:54] neither what
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; availth anything nor what
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; faith workketh by love.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see faith really
[1:04:07] work.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Forgive.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; You can't forgive nobody till you love
[1:04:13] them. Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you don't love them, you
[1:04:16] won't forgive them.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You hold a grudge and hold a
[1:04:20] grudge. He said, "Well, I done forgave
[1:04:23] them." Amen. But I never sat down beside
[1:04:27] them.
[1:04:31] And I shake their hand, but I I know
[1:04:35] they know something wrong. You got to
[1:04:38] love your enemy.
[1:04:41] Amen. You can't do that.
[1:04:43] What you want to do? You know the fruits
[1:04:46] of the spirit and the works of the flesh
[1:04:48] and the fruits of the spirit. How the
[1:04:51] fruits of the spirit going to be
[1:04:52] activated in a life that don't have the
[1:04:54] love of God in it?
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; You got to get the spirit before you
[1:04:58] have the fruits of the spirit.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Oh God. So we we're coming somewhere and
[1:05:07] we're getting somewhere. Amen. A lot of
[1:05:10] people,
[1:05:13] is your faith alive or is it dead?
[1:05:17] Look at somebody. He said, "Don't shake
[1:05:19] hand now." Look at somebody. Your faith
[1:05:20] alive or is it dead?
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; See, cuz faith without works is what?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Dead.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Dead. He said, "And if it's dead, that
[1:05:35] mean you ain't got it." Because he said
[1:05:38] the body without the spirit is what?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Dead.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] And so if the body without the spirit is
[1:05:45] dead, then you have faith without the
[1:05:48] Holy Ghost.
[1:05:50] Without the spirit,
[1:05:53] faith workketh by what?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Love. And the Holy Ghost is the love of
[1:05:57] God shed abroad in your heart. Isn't
[1:05:59] that right?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You got to have love to
[1:06:02] overcome these things.
[1:06:05] He said, "Well, brother, I know I love
[1:06:08] God, but let's go back to James." And I
[1:06:12] I closed. I said I was going to be short
[1:06:13] tonight. I told Rachie those I'll be
[1:06:17] very short tonight. Lord's willing.
[1:06:19] Faith workketh by love.
[1:06:25] I I hope you
[1:06:28] work out your soul's salvation with fear
[1:06:29] and trembling. Amen.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; It's a love and a trust to God that I
[1:06:36] fear. I don't I'm not afraid
[1:06:39] of going to hell, afraid of being lost.
[1:06:43] Amen. The fear I have is the love and
[1:06:46] the reverence I have for him.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] So the fear that you have for God should
[1:06:55] be a love and respect and a reverence
[1:06:57] for God.
[1:06:59] But if you don't have that reverence and
[1:07:01] that love,
[1:07:04] the love is made perfect
[1:07:10] and perfect faith. Your faith is made
[1:07:13] perfect through work how you respond to
[1:07:16] the word, how you act upon the word
[1:07:22] for your works.
[1:07:25] Let's let's read it. Okay. Uh, I'll pick
[1:07:28] back up to 20 verse 2 and 20. It said,
[1:07:32] "But will thou know, oh vain man, that
[1:07:35] faith without works is what?"
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Was not Abraham our father justified by
[1:07:42] what?
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; When he had offered up Isaac at his son
[1:07:48] upon the altar. Amen.
[1:07:52] The Bible says Abraham was the father of
[1:07:54] faith. Ain't that right?
[1:07:56] Seeing thou how faith wrought with his
[1:08:00] works and by works was faith what
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; prophet of God spoke the message perfect
[1:08:09] faith praise God
[1:08:12] faith that's perfect faith amen see God
[1:08:17] wanted to perfect the captain of our
[1:08:19] salvation made was being made perfect
[1:08:22] through what the things he suffered
[1:08:24] isn't that right Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.
[1:08:28] People look like they suffering if they
[1:08:30] come to church. Man, it was cold
[1:08:32] outside. Man, it was raining. Oh, I'm
[1:08:35] suffering.
[1:08:37] Suffering. Oh, man. Oh, I'm suffering.
[1:08:40] Oh, that was I'm suffering. If somebody
[1:08:42] said they don't like you or somebody the
[1:08:45] boss man give you a hard day, I'm
[1:08:47] suffering,
[1:08:48] man. And these people is getting their
[1:08:50] head chopped off, cut off, putting it
[1:08:52] burnt up to the stakes, doing all kind
[1:08:54] of stuff to them. And you suffering. Oh,
[1:08:57] I'm going through. Oh, Lord, you're
[1:09:00] going through mind battles. Amen. Praise
[1:09:02] God. But he said, "Let this mind be in
[1:09:04] you with also in Christ Jesus." Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; So, he he said, "Oh Lord, I beseech you,
[1:09:12] brethren, by the mercy of God." Amen.
[1:09:16] And he said, "No, don't be conformed to
[1:09:18] this world, but be you what?"
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; By the renewing of your mind that you
[1:09:23] might prove what is that good and
[1:09:24] acceptable in what?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Perfect will of God. You want to you you
[1:09:29] want the perfect will of God. You want
[1:09:31] perfect faith. You want, Amen. to walk
[1:09:33] in a perfect faith. Amen. Then you know
[1:09:35] the perfect will of God is his word.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now hear the word. It ought
[1:09:40] to not be a strain on us. Amen. to to
[1:09:43] live a godly life and to walk amen godly
[1:09:46] and be holy. He said, "Be holy if I am
[1:09:48] holy." But he gives you holy the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That you can be holy.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not something that's
[1:09:56] unattainable, but it's attainable. Why?
[1:09:58] Because he gives you his spirit.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] So by the grace of God,
[1:10:10] hallelujah,
[1:10:11] he says, "And
[1:10:15] by works was faith made what?" Perfect.
[1:10:20] Amen. For the scripture
[1:10:24] was fulfilled which said, "Abraham
[1:10:28] what?"
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Believe God. And it was
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; imputed unto him for righteousness.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It was imputed. God, hey, don't worry
[1:10:36] about a thing. If you believe God, God
[1:10:39] says, hey, it's imputed. I Yeah, I look
[1:10:42] at it and God says, you're righteous.
[1:10:46] Amen. All you got to do is believe. He
[1:10:49] said, well, okay. But Abraham faith that
[1:10:54] he had was an evident proven by him
[1:10:58] offering up Isaac.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because the way we live, the
[1:11:03] way we conduct our lives is a manifest
[1:11:07] token of the life that's inside of us.
[1:11:10] The faith that we believe, the faith
[1:11:12] that we have received. Amen. Our life is
[1:11:16] a manifestation
[1:11:18] of the faith of God and our walk and our
[1:11:21] talk. Amen. We're working out our soul
[1:11:24] salvation.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That our lives is Amen. is
[1:11:29] manifesting the works of the I mean the
[1:11:33] the fruits of the spirit.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ that's working in us.
[1:11:38] It's not us just doing the work. It's
[1:11:40] the working of the spirit. The Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost is working
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; by the law is the dos and don'ts. Amen.
[1:11:47] And they had to do it by the flesh.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:11:53] fleshly thing.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The law of Moses. Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; But the law of faith. Praise God.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; and it was imputed in him for
[1:12:04] righteousness.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Once you believe God, you don't have to
[1:12:08] worry about a thing.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I get some somebody to
[1:12:13] believe and accept Jesus Christ. It's
[1:12:15] easy to be baptized in the name of the
[1:12:17] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But what happened to a person that comes
[1:12:20] and get baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[1:12:22] and does not believe.

[1:12:32] received the message? Amen. By
[1:12:34] intellectual knowledge but not but not

[1:13:52] You call me friend. And you see then
[1:13:56] that how by works a man is justified and
