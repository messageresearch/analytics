there's no God father I know there's a God this morning and that God is Jesus Christ father meet every need in this congregation father said the captain's free let them know that you still is here Lord but manifest your word in your people in Jesus name we pray amen go to God I just praying last night and the thought come to me Amen in the Book of Jonah and I know what about running from my subject is this morning is a man running from the presence of God also my subtop it is in his presence if you hear this morning and maybe you say brother Nathan I'm running from God were they a God that know how to catch you amen you're only the first chapter when I read the first verse you may be seated not a word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of MI saying you may be said arises go to ninevee that great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rolls up to flee unto Tasha from the present of the lord and he went down to Joplin and he found a ship going to tashu so he paid the fair there and went down into it to go with them unto Joshua from the president of the Lord but the Lord now I'm telling God got away again you ain't here but the Lord sent a great win into the sea and there was a mighty temperance in the scene so that his ship was like to be broken then the marinas were praised and cried every man unto his God and he cast both walls and there was in the ship and into the scene to light inn of them but Jonah was gone down into the ship in the side of the ship and lay and was fast asleep so the shipmaster came to him and said it to him wasn't thy old sleeper arise called upon thy God is so be that God will thank upon us that we perish not and they said unto everyone and just fellow come let us cast Law that we made known for whom caused the evil come upon us so they cast a lot in the lockpel upon Jonah and they said unto him tell us we pray thee who calls this evil upon us and what is the occupation and went cometh thou and what is the country you know what people are down and he said unto them I am a Hebrew I feel the Lord God Of Heaven which have made the sea and the dry land and there was the meaning of seated that prayed and said unto him why have I done this for to me is new that he played for the presence of the Lord because he told them amen book of Isaiah the sixth chapter amen you know we're dealing with a generation they're running from the presence of God amen is you the king of thy that I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne High and lifted up in his trained filled the temple and above is stood the children each one having six wings and with Twain he covered his face and with train he covered his feet and between he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy if the Lord of Hope the whole earth is full of his glory and it pulls of the door of door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I voice mean I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I drailed in the midst of a people or unclean lift my eyes have seen the king the Lord of Hope then fled one of the children unto me having a live cold in his hand which he had taken with the throne from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and he said low does help touch thy lips thy niggity is taken away thy sin is purged and I heard the boss of the Lord saying who shall I sin and who will go for us this said I him I here I am I send me amen good morning another thank God for everyone that is here we dealing with a man running Jonah a man running for the president of God it also sometimes in his presence many Christians and non-Christian they run from God because they don't want to be saved or they don't understand what it means to be saved up my early as a Young Man I'll let me know you young people with the church and I sit in the back I hear the preacher preaching and many times when I went hit me about four or five hundred people maybe even more and I would say to myself he talking about me I'm not going back to that church but you know we know about a mystery the valley of a false in the mind and I just had in my mind he talking about me so I'm not going back to church and I stopped going to church for years I wouldn't go to church I was running a man running for the brother of God I ran to the world there in the world I found out what sin was about and parted and drinking and smoking and gambling and hustled it and running women so-called running women I find out what life was about on the other side I was on the good side of God but I something like Adam and Eve I want to find out what the other side had to offer me the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and as I tell on the other side for about eight or nine years I learned how to smoke cigarette drink beer Wine Liquor smoke a little repo I just smoke that much I'm just talking I just smoke I couldn't smoke briefly I couldn't help my daddy told me I couldn't drink didn't I couldn't hold my liquor daddy said Son Of All My Children you don't need to drink because you get crazy but I didn't take heed to what Daddy had to say a drink in the house I
