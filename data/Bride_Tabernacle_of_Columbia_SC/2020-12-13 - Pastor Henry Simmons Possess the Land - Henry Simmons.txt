sites and the amorites and the canaanites and the purging perdecites and the havaits and the jedi sites seven nations greater and mighty than thou and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shall smite them and other that destroyed them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy upon them neither shall thou make marriages with them thy daughters thou shall not give unto them his son and nor his daughter shall thou take unto thy son for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindered against you and destroy thee suddenly but thus shall ye deal with them you shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their grooves and burn their graven images with fire for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in normal than any people for ye were furious of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep his oath which he had sworn unto your fathers has the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage bondman from the land of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth the covenant and mercy and will with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations god bless you read this word you will be seated we thank the lord for its word amen let us just bow again father thank you for your word lord may you bless it now in jesus name amen the subject this morning is possessing a possessed land possess the land [Music] god had given them the land to possess it he so has god and likewise as it was in the natural so it is in the spirit second peter 1 second peter 1 and uh the third verse i got a lot of scripture but i can't read them all so i'll just try to give you a summary by the grace of god there's so many uh things that i see the bible says that the natural types is spiritual a lot of things that were in the old testament on the shadows of the reality form amen it was speaking of something that was to come as we dealt with the natural enemies they meant so we deal with spiritual demon power and as they were in a natural or battle we are in a spiritual battle and god has given us a land that to possess has he given them the promised land god has given us a promised land so you and i amen have a homeland a land we could call home amen you know sometimes i'm out in africa and somewhere or hungary or some country but you know it's nothing like coming back home maybe i'm just crossing jamaica or in trinidad but it's nothing like coming home you know as soon as you get uh you know uh in florida or new york or one of those places you're embarking upon as soon as that plane hit home you feel better because you're home amen you figure you ain't meant that in home amen when you're in a strange country you don't have certain privileges but when you're at home you feel like you're a citizen of that country and thank god our citizenship is in heaven are you with me and if you're a citizen of heaven amen amen jesus realizes my kingdom is not of this world are you with me he realized that he was a

will interfere with your promises with your blessings the devil don't want you to walk in authority and walk in power and walk in victory so he will do everything he can amen to distract you and keep you from your blessings are you with me but you got to let the enemy know that god gave me this land and i am i'm here to possess it i'm here to have what god has given me and no devil in hell can take it from me you see what i'm saying amen you not see the enemy might say well i've been here before you oh you have been but god has given israel that land they might lay hold and lay claim on it you might have certain attributes that were given to you by your natural father and mother that comes from your family genes in the natural and those attributes are given to you because amen those are genes and you can look at certain characteristics and face your features and somebody said that's a simmons i know cause they all look alike are you with me oh that's a johnson because they all look alike isn't that right that's a palmer yes i know you're a palmer ain't got no are you with me so folks amen you have natural genes that you look like amen one another amen but there are spiritual genes that god says amen he wants you to look like your father which is in heaven isn't that right when you look in the mirror you must see jesus amen you must see the image of god amen because god made adam in his own image isn't that right so you are being changed from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord amen and when you look and behold your face in the mirror amen you don't see you but you see him amen because the very reflection of the face amen that you're saying is the face of god and that's what you want to see god's word being praise god the very image of his person when the bride was revealed in god's own word what you saw they made christ reveal in his own word you saw amen the bride oh you would be and she was mrs jesus christ because she was the word amen made flesh praise god in the form of the bride as he was the word made flesh it meant in the form of jesus christ to come in headshot form so we come in body form as the church are you what man so the church is his body jesus christ is the head of the body the church are you if he was the word and you were born of his bone we are made of the same material amen we're born of his bone flesh of his flesh so we a word amen of his word spirit of his spirit amen the light that was in him and now that life is in us are you with me are you going somewhere brother and sister we going somewhere your promised land your homeland amen this is where amen hope you arrive amen in your destiny and understand who you are and that you can be positionally placed in your inheritance amen understand they make your inheritance understand that you are blessed people he told them you are a special people you are up to kill your people yes you are special to me amen and i didn't choose you because you were greater and number amen it's because of my love for you it's because i love you you know it's kind of hard for a a a man to say i love you amen you know you know i tell my wife every day i us i love you sometimes you don't want to hear i love you i know man telling i love you john shantay i know he said i love you amen y'all man ain't got enough gracious i love you you're taking out you'll say i love you i tell rachel i said i love you am i right it's hard to tell those hard-hit boys i love you but you got sometimes you know let folks know you care you see we want to uh we don't want to express and open our mouths and say i love you amen it's hard because we try to be rough and tough isn't that right so it's difficult you know sometimes we come up in families where there's a lot of affection and then sometimes we come up in families we don't hear that word sometimes are you with me but you're in the family of god now he said because i love you that's why i chose you because i love you are you with me in other words you're special to god amen and the prophet of god said in the future of the trump and he said now you know what man would take his wife through the tribulation period he said because you love her amen and because jesus shedded his blood for you he's not but the church would go through uh tribulation but the bride amen you were the purchase of his blood god is not gonna take you through that amen he paid the price for you isn't that right your purge through the blood amen you don't need the great tribulation the tribulation period to encourage you or you will be so i thank god that we don't have to go through that triple but i believe that things are mounting up you know in in my prayer and in my uh gathering together this morning as i was out here praying i i looked at the condition of the world and i said lord what it's going to take uh it took israel something to get back into her homeland world war one world war ii when they killed all the jews and amen and hitler amen killed about 6 million and mussolini and all these uh dictators and amen they persecute the jews because they were just god's chosen people because they were jews they were killed they meant they hated them because of who they were because they were they meant jews amen and folks will hate you because you were christian because god has chosen to put his love in you amen people the devil hates you and despise you he said so as they did the jews so would they do the bribe it's because god has chosen to put a place's love in you are you with me so the people will hate you and despise you just because you're christians amen are you with me but amen what it calls the pressure caused the jews to go home they met the jews were scattered throughout all the nations but when they were persecuted amen there was a call and alarmed go home [Music] amen let's go home amen when we get back in our homeland y'all come come on amen come on battle of armageddon come on israel emmy the jews back in their homeland they're not afraid of the superpowers they're not afraid of nobody i'm home god gave us this land now you try to take it are you with me now a little small group of people amen but yet they're not taking nothing for nobody amen they're in that land and all the muslim countries around about them but they're saying i'm home god gave it to me not trying to take it amen oh yes they're not afraid of america they're not afraid of russia they're not afraid of china they're not afraid of superpowers because they have god's power are you with me hallelujah oh thank god for god's power amen i hope you understand where your promised land is let me just i'm gonna cut all of this shot because this is about five hour lesson so i'm gonna cut a show let's go to the uh book of luke 24. god is good amen you love him today amen why don't us why don't we just give god a hand clap of praise and tell him i love you jesus i love you i love you i love you i love you oh hallelujah first time i did that amen but i i think god is good in hell every now and then you know folks give him a hand clapping pray that is something folks practice up in his 20th this 21st that's what that's true what a 20 i don't know anyway people are saying give god a handclap of praise amen sometimes it's just traditional or something but god is good anyhow nothing wrong with clapping your hand i don't see no fault in it amen god is good amen everybody we ought to clap for is ought to be for jesus amen okay now in luke 24 and 45 now he said then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures isn't that right now it's something about understanding the scripture if you don't understand the scripture then you know god had to send some prophets that they might show you what god is doing in their day and god will uh it was seven nations that they had to drive out amen to get what god gave them amen and i'm gonna tell you something you know you got demons that you have to drive out of your land and and you must let them know amen these demons got to be driven off of my land they met praise god sometimes we have to drive demons out that are amen that have damaged your life that have tried to mess you up and try to take your mind try to take your home try to just just uh cause all kind of heaven in your life amen praise god sometimes there's demons amen that have attacked you when you couldn't even help yourself some of those demons have messed you up when you were a little child but even being a little child going through certain things that you had no no oh goodness you had nothing to do with it but the devil amen harass you and did you wrong then and it scared you now amen but god says amen that devil that scarred your life amen i'm getting rid of that devil hallelujah they amen the devil amen played heaven amen sometimes amen oh oh lord i ain't going to get into it because i'll be there for a long time but nevertheless the land is yours your promised land god amen the enemy that has tormented them had them in bondage god said i destroyed that devil in egypt and i'm going to straw these devils here in the land that i gave you brother and sister the sins that you were born in up into that present time god said when you repent of your sin be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin god said the promise is that you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen and praise god when you get the baptism in the holy ghost i want you to cross over this jaw and i want you to possess the land praise god there's other demons you have to drive out amen praise god all of those demons that held you in bondage and egypt and sin amen they had dominion over you but these demons over in the promised land they don't have dominion over them they meant you to drive them out praise god hallelujah praise god they're going to sat down they're going to stab you in the face and they gonna tell you amen the walls of jericho are too thick and then they're too high to come down but i want you to know jericho i don't care how high your walls are i don't care how thick they are you might be fortified but your wall's gonna come down because god has given me the victory oh yes i got the victory now jericho walls coming now oh lord it said here it says 46 verse and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it be whose christ the suffering arise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin shall be preached in his name among all nations

and and glorifying god and i didn't care whether he had an interpreter or not i was just feeling good are you with me so it's so and god began to speak to my spirit concerning certain things but i can't speak them now and but our god is good amen but the promise i said it would do good you young people that don't know how to pray just call on jesus and say jesus of that power in your name jesus amen you said uh in my name you can cast out devil the confidence will come in the name of jesus jesus i don't know how to pray and i don't know how to get the holy ghost but i'm calling you jesus
