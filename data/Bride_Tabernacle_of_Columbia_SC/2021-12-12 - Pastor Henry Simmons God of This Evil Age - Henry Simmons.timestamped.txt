[35:09] the book of
[35:11] second corinthians fourth chapter
[35:20] we and
[35:23] i'll read the first you read the next we
[35:25] read the last verse together
[35:27] the god of this evil age
[35:31] it says
[35:32] therefore sin we have this ministry as
[35:35] we receive mercy
[35:37] we faint not too
[35:57] it is here to them that are laws for
[36:12] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[36:15] jesus the lord and ourselves your
[36:18] servant for jesus sake six
[36:31] but we have this treasure in earthen
[36:34] vessels
[36:35] that the ethnicity of the power may be
[36:37] of god and not of us 8.
[36:46] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[36:50] but not destroyed 10.
[37:02] for we which
[37:04] uh live are always delivered unto death
[37:08] for jesus sake
[37:10] that the life also of jesus
[37:13] might be made manifested in our martyr
[37:16] flesh 12.
[37:22] we have the same spirit of faith
[37:24] according as it is written i believe and
[37:28] therefore
[37:30] have i spoken we also believe and
[37:33] therefore speak 14.
[37:43] for all things are for your sake
[37:46] that the abundance of grace might
[37:48] through the thanksgiving of many
[37:51] renown
[37:52] to the glory of god
[37:55] 16.
[38:04] for our light affliction
[38:06] which is but for a moment work is for us
[38:10] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[38:12] of glory
[38:13] 18 together
[38:15] while we look not at the things that are
[38:18] seen
[38:18] but the things which are not seen but
[38:21] the things which are seen are temporal
[38:24] but the things that are not seen are
[38:26] eternal that god bless you towards me be
[38:29] seated
[38:32] you know
[38:34] i was on the other day i was looking at
[38:38] eternity and
[38:40] and the eternal things amen
[38:44] but by the grace of god and now and just
[38:46] imagine how long eternity
[38:49] is and
[38:50] when did eternity began and when does it
[38:53] end
[38:54] and we know that eternity speaks
[38:57] of
[38:58] no beginning and no end
[39:00] and to have eternal life
[39:02] means that
[39:04] praise god as we look at eternal life
[39:06] we're looking at god's life
[39:09] amen
[39:10] and if we have god's life inside of us
[39:12] in
[39:13] amen we are
[39:16] born again amen
[39:18] we have the holy ghost and that is
[39:20] eternal life
[39:21] praise god and knowing that just you
[39:24] know just before we just get into the
[39:26] subject i was just thinking on that you
[39:28] know having eternal life what it really
[39:31] entails what it really means to you and
[39:33] i to have eternal life
[39:36] praise god
[39:38] what would a man give in exchange for
[39:41] eternal life what would a man i i mean
[39:43] this world don't mean nothing when we we
[39:46] compare it to eternal life
[39:48] you know when the men get down to the
[39:50] last i don't care if they got a billion
[39:52] dollars
[39:53] i don't care if they're
[39:55] or whatever but when it comes down to
[39:58] dying they meant their money their
[40:00] billions mean nothing their trillions
[40:02] mean nothing amen because amen life is
[40:05] more than that
[40:07] to die you lose it all
[40:10] amen but if you die in christ you're
[40:12] gained amen
[40:14] amen
[40:16] so by the grace of god as we look this
[40:19] uh this morning that
[40:21] the god of this evil age
[40:25] it's two forces it's
[40:27] two opposing spirits
[40:29] that we're looking at this morning
[40:34] it's um
[40:35] god in the devil amen
[40:38] these opposing spirits they're against
[40:41] one another amen amen and
[40:43] seeing that we have two opposing spirits
[40:47] we look at who's in control amen
[40:51] who's in control the god of this evil
[40:53] age who's in control
[40:55] and as we look at our lives we're made
[40:57] up of body soul and spirit
[41:00] and here the prophet of god said outside
[41:02] man is the physical
[41:04] being
[41:06] which
[41:07] is controlled by six senses five senses
[41:11] uh on five five cent the outside man
[41:14] controlled by the five senses amen
[41:16] the inside man amen
[41:19] we know it's controlled by
[41:22] five senses conscious memory
[41:24] imagination and so forth amen
[41:28] but
[41:29] as the outside man has taste feel
[41:33] uh smell and hear and so forth
[41:36] we look at that and we we see who's in
[41:39] really in control but we look down a
[41:42] little deeper
[41:43] and um inside the spirit uh
[41:47] is the soul
[41:48] and it's controlled by one thing
[41:52] your free will amen amen
[41:55] you can accept what the devil says
[41:58] or
[41:59] you can accept what god says
[42:02] that determines what spirit is in there
[42:06] if the spirit of god
[42:08] it will feed on the things of god amen
[42:12] and if
[42:13] it won't
[42:14] or anything of this world amen
[42:18] jesus said
[42:20] if you love the world the love of the
[42:21] father is not in you isn't that right
[42:24] so what happens is what you're feeding
[42:27] them what your desires is all about amen
[42:30] if a man loved the world the love of the
[42:32] father is not in him amen are you with
[42:34] me
[42:35] but when you love god you want the will
[42:37] of god to be
[42:38] in your life amen
[42:40] you want to please god
[42:42] amen and these uh these forces these two
[42:46] spirits
[42:47] opposing forces the devil amen is
[42:50] fighting against god
[42:52] amen you have a free will you can choose
[42:55] which one you want to be in control of
[42:57] your life
[42:58] if you want the devil but the devil
[43:00] works in
[43:01] a a very deceptive manner
[43:05] and because the devil is so deceiving
[43:08] then i i i find
[43:11] that
[43:12] because the devil is so deceiving folks
[43:15] are being led
[43:17] in the era of the wicked and not even
[43:20] though they're being laid
[43:22] here it says here in romans 8 let's just
[43:25] look at romans 8
[43:26] and um 14
[43:29] romans 8 and 14.
[43:31] now
[43:32] i want to be led by the spirit of god
[43:34] how about you
[43:36] i want to be led by god's spirit amen
[43:40] and if we are laughed by god's spirit
[43:42] amen then god tells us here and says for
[43:45] as many as the land by the spirit of god
[43:47] they are the what
[43:49] the sons of god now if we are
[43:53] amen if we don't want correction and we
[43:56] don't
[43:58] see people are actually victims
[44:02] of evil spirits and they don't even know
[44:04] and that's why sometimes you and i as
[44:07] christians and as people that love the
[44:09] lord and
[44:11] and have the baptism of the holy ghost
[44:13] sometimes
[44:15] we're not uh
[44:17] really compassionate enough to
[44:20] understand that we must be patient
[44:23] with those that are in error amen amen
[44:26] amen sometimes we don't have enough
[44:28] patience here in the second timothy
[44:32] i
[44:34] i was just looking at
[44:37] the husband is the head of the wife
[44:39] isn't that right
[44:42] and if the husband is the head of the
[44:43] wife then christ is the head of the
[44:45] church
[44:47] and he's the head of the bride are you
[44:50] with me amen
[44:51] so
[44:53] christ is the head of the church the
[44:55] husband is the head of the wife isn't it
[44:57] now your head determines where your body
[45:00] goes amen amen
[45:02] are you with me
[45:04] your head leaves your body
[45:07] the church is the body of christ
[45:10] the head is christ
[45:13] isn't that right
[45:15] and when your body goes
[45:17] when he leaves me i'll follow
[45:20] now who's in control of your life it
[45:23] shows amen how you being led
[45:26] [Music]
[45:28] are you with me
[45:30] so here and and second corinthians two
[45:33] here
[45:34] second corinthians two i hope caleb you
[45:36] got me a little bit uh i may want second
[45:39] corinthians two
[45:40] and twenty-two
[45:43] two and twenty-two
[45:46] god is good amen
[45:48] the head of the body amen
[45:51] and i was just looking at people are not
[45:53] married to the word they're married they
[45:56] meant to their own
[45:58] cells
[46:01] are you with me
[46:02] people
[46:03] are not being led by their husband
[46:06] which is christ who is the word
[46:09] they're being led by their own
[46:11] selfish desire
[46:13] and that's not really theirs they're
[46:16] being deceived by another spirit amen
[46:19] amen
[46:20] the spirit of deception that works in
[46:23] people's lives
[46:24] and the bible said uh there'll be
[46:26] deceivers and they'll deceive their own
[46:29] self amen so the the devil wants you to
[46:33] think that you are in control
[46:36] that's the greatest thing the devil
[46:39] makes you believe that you're in control
[46:42] of what you're doing
[46:44] but actually a person actually is taken
[46:48] captive amen
[46:50] actually a person is a victim of
[46:52] circumstances amen it's because amen
[46:56] even listen to the devil's lie
[47:00] is because amen she listened to the
[47:03] devil interpretation of the word amen
[47:06] when the word was plain thou shall not
[47:09] touch god should not eat of the tree of
[47:11] knowledge and good and evil if the day
[47:13] you eat you're gonna die
[47:14] [Music]
[47:16] but the devil told her you can eat and
[47:18] you won't die amen are you with me
[47:21] and the devil tell you it's all right to
[47:24] eat
[47:26] and not die it's all right to do what
[47:28] you're doing it ain't gonna do you no
[47:30] harm
[47:32] so if a person really believed that it
[47:34] was poison that they were eating up they
[47:37] wouldn't eat it
[47:38] amen and we know eating is not
[47:41] barely eating as a uh are you eating a
[47:44] pie or
[47:45] eating some fried chicken but he named
[47:48] that praise god he said such is the way
[47:50] of a daughter's woman
[47:52] she eat it and wipes her mouth and she
[47:54] says i've done nothing
[47:56] amen
[47:57] are you with me
[47:59] so eating uh many of times has to do
[48:03] amen with uh amen your decision that
[48:06] you're making amen and we can see the
[48:10] fruits
[48:12] amen praise god we can see the what's
[48:15] been manifested in your life whether or
[48:18] not you'll
[48:19] are in bondage
[48:23] see when they
[48:24] eve did what she did when god when god
[48:27] came in the cool of the evening adam and
[48:30] eve was hiding
[48:33] why because they understood that they
[48:34] had disobeyed god
[48:37] and because they were disobeying god
[48:39] they meant then they really they feared
[48:42] and they tried to cover it up amen amen
[48:45] brother and sister
[48:49] now here
[48:51] in uh
[48:53] second corinthians 2
[48:56] and 22 it says here what
[49:00] caleb please flee also youthful lust
[49:03] okay
[49:04] it's a thing we call youthful
[49:07] lust
[49:08] fleeing that's why young people you got
[49:09] to flee it
[49:12] you know so
[49:14] a lot of times
[49:15] young people are not conscious
[49:18] and god said to timothy i know you're
[49:20] saved and i know you
[49:22] you know servant of god and
[49:24] and paul had a lot of confidence in
[49:26] timothy
[49:27] and timothy but he told timothy i want
[49:30] you to watch something
[49:32] i want you to flee you for lust
[49:36] amen because all that is in the world is
[49:38] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[49:40] eye and the pride of life and i want you
[49:41] to flee
[49:44] amen because you can get caught up if
[49:46] you're not careful
[49:48] so i'm trying to warn you timothy flee
[49:51] you for less
[49:54] instead of the war against your members
[49:55] isn't that right
[49:57] he said flee it amen
[50:00] and maybe i'll get you how do you know
[50:04] amen
[50:05] uh uh
[50:07] what do you flee from you for lust go
[50:09] ahead
[50:10] ii timothy 2 flee also youthful lust
[50:14] but follow righteousness
[50:16] it's calling what you're following it's
[50:18] very important that you follow
[50:21] righteousness
[50:23] you know
[50:24] if you don't follow righteousness you're
[50:26] going to be a victim
[50:28] of youthful lust
[50:30] amen young people hear me amen
[50:33] if you don't
[50:35] flee you for lust then you're going to
[50:38] be a victim amen amen
[50:41] amen if you if you don't want to follow
[50:44] righteousness
[50:47] if you don't make up your mind i want to
[50:49] live right i want to do right
[50:51] praise
[50:52] god but follow righteousness
[50:56] but see sometimes you know we don't want
[50:59] to do we don't want to follow jesus
[51:02] we don't want to follow the things that
[51:04] are right
[51:06] we don't want to be led by the spirit
[51:09] which is leading us to the words amen it
[51:12] shows that our husband is in we're in
[51:15] subjection to our husband the headship
[51:18] of the word amen amen are you up there
[51:21] amen
[51:22] and when we're in subjection to the
[51:24] headship of the word then we flee from
[51:27] you for us
[51:29] and we follow righteousness
[51:32] amen are you with me amen

[54:54] the firm and proud of a righteous man
[54:56] avail as much
[54:59] are you with me
[55:01] but here we
[55:02] people have got the attitude they live
[55:05] in a kind of way and they call upon god
[55:07] to god heard my prayer god thank god for
[55:10] hearing you blessed be the name of the
[55:12] lord but the bible say god he is not
[55:14] sinners

[55:17] that
[55:18] that's what we hear
[55:20] isn't that right
[55:22] but here we are sinners just calling on
[55:24] the name of the lord out of an evil
[55:27] heart and doing all kind of wickedness
[55:30] the bible said the prayer of the
[55:31] righteous avail is much are you with me
[55:35] and he said if my people they were to
[55:37] call by my name will humble themselves
[55:40] people got so much pride that they can

[56:21] this is the deceiving age people can
[56:24] live any kind of way and do any kind of
[56:26] thing and think it's all right to do why
[56:30] because satan has worked his work in
[56:32] deception and given them as the prophet
[56:35] of god said in this age he's giving them
[56:38] a strong delusion
[56:41] amen they actually amen the devil is set
[56:44] in the temple of god showing himself
[56:46] that he is god and people will worship
[56:49] him as god they would believe a lie
[56:51] because they learned not to love of the
[56:54] truth
[56:55] so god would give them a strong illusion
[56:58] that they should believe the law
[57:01] that they might be there
[57:03] who believe not the truth
[57:05] amen praise god if they would only
[57:08] believe that oh god amen you can't do

[1:05:34] things that he worked and the things
[1:05:36] that he do he'll keep you busy that you
[1:05:39] won't be a help
[1:05:41] and a blessing to others amen see that's
[1:05:44] what the devil won't even why you can be
[1:05:46] encouraging and blessing and
[1:05:48] strengthening other people the devil
[1:05:50] have you so busy and so uh occupied to

[1:08:46] anymore
[1:08:47] you lost it amen
[1:08:49] why because amen in the proceeding you

[1:08:54] certain things because so you lost your
[1:08:57] gentleness and your kindness amen the
[1:09:00] sweetness of god that comes from the
[1:09:02] holy ghost that sweet loving spirit amen
[1:09:06] instead of
[1:09:08] instead of you having that sweet
[1:09:10] all that mental spirit that rests on a
[1:09:13] believer and that love of god that you
[1:09:15] can embrace
[1:09:17] and you can go freely before the throne
[1:09:19] of grace and find help in the time of

[1:09:28] to have the peace of god
[1:09:30] when you end up you're in a place in a
[1:09:33] state of maturity

[1:09:41] that peace and that love amen don't have
[1:09:44] the peace that you have don't have that
[1:09:46] love and they are not experiencing the
[1:09:48] sweetness of the spirit

[1:11:22] makers as well
[1:11:23] because of the what
[1:11:25] little love of god is and brought

[1:11:28] because of the love of god shed abroad
[1:11:30] in our hearts we can have patience

[1:11:34] because the patience is the attribute of
[1:11:37] the spirit of god amen amen and because

[1:12:05] and a person of jesus christ
[1:12:07] is manifested by his own characteristics
[1:12:11] are you look man
[1:12:12] so you
[1:12:13] you see the nature of god the divine
[1:12:16] nature of god amen exemplified amen in
[1:12:20] the christian walk and god amen knows
[1:12:23] what he wants to do with the word in
[1:12:25] this hour and we know what god is doing
[1:12:27] in this hour what he's expecting of you
[1:12:29] and i
[1:12:30] and he's expecting us to walk in the
[1:12:32] statue of a perfect man to come into
[1:12:34] maturity amen amen but in coming into
[1:12:36] maturity we're going to be tried and
[1:12:38] tested
[1:12:43] it says
[1:12:44] this is why i want to conclude in in in
[1:12:48] a sense because this is
[1:12:51] i says lord
[1:12:52] you know going back over
[1:12:55] god of this evil age and thinking it's a
[1:12:57] lot of true powerful things there but
[1:13:01] this is where i want to focus just a
[1:13:04] little bit because sometimes
[1:13:07] you're doing and you're not
[1:13:08] understanding what you're doing
[1:13:10] and why you're doing what you're doing
[1:13:13] and so
[1:13:15] lately
[1:13:16] because i said because i was about 70
[1:13:19] years old and forget about all the
[1:13:21] craziness and what people say thing i
[1:13:23] said ain't got time for it don't mean
[1:13:26] nothing anyway you know what i said
[1:13:28] but it's not only that god is showing me
[1:13:31] something it's not
[1:13:33] it's it's a it's a level of maturity
[1:13:36] you know what i'm saying the things that
[1:13:37] bothered you when you was 10 and
[1:13:40] 13 and 25 and
[1:13:44] 40 and

[1:13:48] you get 70 you say man i'm about ready
[1:13:50] to go home

[1:14:21] matured let's go to heaven
[1:14:23] are you with me
[1:14:25] because
[1:14:25] you know it's better that you learn you
[1:14:28] don't have to wait till you get old to
[1:14:29] learn that all the blessings of god is
[1:14:32] available for you as a young person you
[1:14:34] don't have to wait till you get six to
[1:14:36] seven we're telling you the blessings

[1:14:42] hallelujah don't let everybody be
[1:14:44] blessed around you and you set back yeah
[1:14:47] i i i think i i love renting the house
[1:14:50] why are you gonna rent the house and god
[1:14:52] want to give you a house
[1:14:57] i'm talking about god want to give you
[1:15:00] you know i hadn't seen the person
[1:15:03] yet
[1:15:04] that come in the church be faithful
[1:15:06] faith tithes and offering and god didn't
[1:15:08] bless them abundantly amen
[1:15:11] this is
[1:15:12] over 45 years of pastor
[1:15:15] and i hadn't seen that amen
[1:15:18] my old bishop used to tell me he said
[1:15:20] you pay your tithes in the offering
[1:15:23] and be faithful to god
[1:15:24] and god will bless you amen amen amen
[1:15:27] i used to hear bishop washington say
[1:15:29] that all the time
[1:15:30] you know you be faithful to god god will
[1:15:32] bless you
[1:15:34] are you with me
[1:15:35] and it's proven to be true
[1:15:38] amen the people that faithful to god and
[1:15:42] put god first god blesses them all kind
[1:15:45] of ways that don't matter i mean they
[1:15:47] bless them all in coming in and going
[1:15:49] out all they gotta do is be faithful to
[1:15:51] god
[1:15:52] you see the you'll see sometimes it
[1:15:54] looks like it ain't coming but it comes
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:15:58] amen praise god just it might take a
[1:16:00] little time sometime and take a little
[1:16:02] longer than others but god blesses his
[1:16:05] children and faithful to him
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:11] so here we are this is the part i want
[1:16:13] to close in and i i took too long to get
[1:16:16] here but uh and i probably aren't going
[1:16:18] to avoid a whole lot
[1:16:20] um okay 25 read
[1:16:23] in meekness instructing those that
[1:16:25] oppose themselves
[1:16:26] if god pre-adventure will give them
[1:16:29] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[1:16:31] truth see some people oppose themselves
[1:16:37] i said it's two opposing spirits
[1:16:40] the devil and god
[1:16:43] and sometimes
[1:16:44] see
[1:16:45] paul instructing timothy it's some folk
[1:16:49] that you're going to have to be patient
[1:16:50] with because they oppose their own self
[1:16:53] amen
[1:16:55] but he says here
[1:16:57] uh that
[1:16:59] god prevents you
[1:17:04] will give them repentance to the
[1:17:07] acknowledgment of the truth
[1:17:09] so he says i want you
[1:17:12] to be apt to teach
[1:17:15] i have patient
[1:17:15] teach patient
[1:17:17] and meekness
[1:17:18] and meekness see sometimes we want to
[1:17:21] tell people you are not to be doing that
[1:17:23] i you know god continue to hell for
[1:17:25] doing that he said
[1:17:28] you see that oh you know
[1:17:31] no no no no no in meekness
[1:17:34] see that's the part we miss you it's all
[1:17:36] right for you to tell them not to do it
[1:17:38] in meekness
[1:17:41] you got to be
[1:17:42] gentle
[1:17:44] because they don't know that they are
[1:17:46] succumbed
[1:17:48] that they overcome with the spirit they
[1:17:50] don't know
[1:17:53] not all people if they only knew the
[1:17:55] power
[1:17:56] of the spirit that got control over them
[1:17:59] you know sometimes a people
[1:18:03] a woman a man might dress a certain way
[1:18:06] not knowing that it's temptation and not
[1:18:08] knowing that it's presenting a a filthy
[1:18:12] and unclean spirit and i think the
[1:18:14] prophet god called it a prostitute and
[1:18:16] spirit
[1:18:17] sometimes they don't know that the
[1:18:18] spirit inside of them is a prostitute
[1:18:20] and spirit that they're showing the um
[1:18:23] you know things that they should not
[1:18:25] show
[1:18:26] are you with me
[1:18:28] sometimes they don't know that
[1:18:29] inside of them is a prostituting spirit
[1:18:32] though they might not never commit to
[1:18:34] act
[1:18:36] in a sense
[1:18:38] but when men look on them the men commit
[1:18:41] adultery amen amen are you with me
[1:18:45] now it all not to be said but sometimes
[1:18:47] you have to tell people because people
[1:18:49] are unconscious of what they're doing
[1:18:51] sometimes amen
[1:18:55] but
[1:18:56] them being ignorant of that you can't ah
[1:19:00] but you know and then meekness
[1:19:03] instructing those that oppose what
[1:19:08] they opposed themselves they uh actually
[1:19:11] now look what it says in the next verse
[1:19:16] 26 and that they may recover themselves
[1:19:20] out of the snare of the devil who are
[1:19:22] taken
[1:19:23] captive by him
[1:19:25] see
[1:19:26] they are taking what
[1:19:28] they are taking captive
[1:19:31] see and they not they not they don't
[1:19:33] know they are taken captive why because
[1:19:37] the spirit of deception the devil has
[1:19:40] deceived him that they are all right i'm
[1:19:44] saved i'm sanctified i'm holy ghost
[1:19:47] filled and i'm five baptized and i go on
[1:19:50] my way to heaven
[1:19:53] see what i'm saying
[1:19:55] when the bible says a woman should not
[1:19:57] wear that which pertaining to a man
[1:20:00] for all that do so is abomination in the
[1:20:02] sight of god
[1:20:04] so a woman when she put on a pair of
[1:20:06] pants she don't think are you doing
[1:20:08] nothing wrong
[1:20:10] these are ladies
[1:20:12] or when they wear you know certain
[1:20:14] things
[1:20:14] they they don't feel condemned at all
[1:20:17] why
[1:20:19] you know
[1:20:21] it's a lack of teaching preaching in the
[1:20:23] pulpit
[1:20:25] they're telling the people it's all
[1:20:26] right
[1:20:27] but we gotta in meekness instructing
[1:20:29] those that amen amen oppose themselves
[1:20:34] amen you got to be gentle with folk
[1:20:37] because folk don't know
[1:20:42] that a spirit
[1:21:03] instructed those that oppose themselves
[1:21:06] so by the grace of god people
[1:21:08] oppose their own
[1:21:10] self and it came to me really strong
[1:21:14] that you have to be careful
[1:21:16] when a person is the victim of a cat
[1:21:19] in captivity by a spirit
[1:21:22] and you
[1:21:24] are actually looking down or trying to
[1:21:26] treat the person with the wrong kind of
[1:21:29] attitude and a person is taken captive
[1:21:32] by a spirit
[1:21:34] that they don't even know the bible says
[1:21:37] with meekness
[1:21:39] you got to instruct them that oppose
[1:21:41] their own self
[1:21:43] see they don't they don't know
[1:21:46] and a lot of spirits can get on people
[1:21:49] and they can conduct their lives
[1:21:52] in such a way
[1:21:54] that you have to be patient with them
[1:21:56] amen
[1:21:57] and if you're not patient with them
[1:22:00] then you can call
[1:22:02] you know things that happen in their
[1:22:03] lives that would not have happened if
[1:22:06] you were only been patient
[1:22:09] but because of lack of patience
[1:22:14] a person that is taken captive by our
[1:22:17] evil spirit
[1:22:19] some people are taken captive
[1:22:21] sometimes by
[1:22:23] a gossiping spirit
[1:22:26] a lying spirit
[1:22:28] and sometimes you have to just be
[1:22:30] patient with if you go straight at that
[1:22:32] spirit that spirit will tell you you
[1:22:34] lying
[1:22:36] you know what i'm saying sometimes you
[1:22:37] have to let things work out
[1:22:41] like time and patience with
[1:22:43] foe
[1:22:45] loving them that oppose their own self
[1:22:48] amen they don't understand that the
[1:22:50] spirit doesn't got in here
[1:22:53] now if david would have handled saul
[1:22:55] like saul was handling david then david
[1:22:58] would have killed saul
[1:23:01] but david had a lot of patience why
[1:23:04] because god amen had given david word
[1:23:08] amen i i know what the word said i can't
[1:23:11] touch god's anointing amen
[1:23:14] i don't care what he does to me i cannot
[1:23:17] touch him
[1:23:19] because he's god's anointed
[1:23:22] are you a man
[1:23:24] so david amen had you know
[1:23:27] and and i thank god for people like
[1:23:30] joseph and david and different
[1:23:31] experiences that god has given given us
[1:23:34] in the bible and people like stephen
[1:23:36] that was being stoned to death by him by
[1:23:39] saul and in in that crowd and he said
[1:23:42] forgive him
[1:23:44] see i thank god that it comes a time
[1:23:47] amen praise god when amen when folk are
[1:23:50] actually throwing stones at you and you
[1:23:52] have enough grace in your heart to
[1:23:55] understand that damn it's not them it's
[1:23:57] a spirit that's got them doing this
[1:24:01] are you a man
[1:24:02] and so what happens amen god even had
[1:24:06] mercy on you and i because it was a
[1:24:08] spirit that had control over our lives
[1:24:11] amen we were possessed by devils and
[1:24:14] demons amen that had us in bondage but
[1:24:18] god came jesus came and died for us
[1:24:22] amen he went to the cross and he gave
[1:24:24] himself for us
[1:24:26] brother and sister he could have amen
[1:24:28] said amen
[1:24:30] he could have said something like some
[1:24:31] folk that was devils
[1:24:35] but he didn't look at us as devils
[1:24:37] he looked at us with love
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:41] and he said it's the long suffering of
[1:24:43] god
[1:24:44] that calls us to repentance
[1:24:46] amen i'm so glad that god gave us space
[1:24:49] to repent
[1:24:50] god allowed us to repent of our sins
[1:24:54] and
[1:24:54] accept jesus christ
[1:24:56] i'm glad that he gave us
[1:24:58] amen
[1:24:59] grace in this hour are you with me
[1:25:02] see because what happens amen
[1:25:05] things that we are experiencing god is
[1:25:09] saying to timothy i i i'm charging you
[1:25:12] i'm i'm required of you to know how to
[1:25:15] handle situations so of those that amen
[1:25:18] praise god oppose their own soul amen
[1:25:21] i'm trying to help you to pull some out
[1:25:24] of the fire
[1:25:26] praise god because they amen they're
[1:25:28] headed to the fire but you'll be able to
[1:25:31] pull some from the fire
[1:25:34] oh you would have been
[1:25:35] and i i'm saying to you amen be patient
[1:25:38] with one another be patient with your
[1:25:41] brother be patient with your sister be
[1:25:43] patient with those amen that you feel
[1:25:45] like amen are in arrow be patient with
[1:25:48] them
[1:25:50] are you with me
[1:25:51] amen they might be going through a
[1:25:53] little something pray for them be
[1:25:55] patient to
[1:25:56] if if you have enough meekness and
[1:25:58] gentleness to go to him and say brother
[1:26:01] and sister i want you to make it in the
[1:26:03] kingdom come on and go to heaven with me
[1:26:06] i love you brother i love your sister
[1:26:09] sometimes you're the one that ain't
[1:26:11] maybe able to pull somebody out the fire
[1:26:13] you're the one to show that love and
[1:26:15] that reaching out amen your
[1:26:18] hands are mercy and understanding they
[1:26:20] meant that you were in sin one day
[1:26:23] somebody reached out to you and somebody
[1:26:25] cared enough about you to tell you the
[1:26:28] truth amen where would you be if god
[1:26:30] didn't love you
[1:26:32] if god didn't care about your walk
[1:26:35] i'm here to let you go on amen praise
[1:26:37] god
[1:26:40] brother and sister i'm so glad

[1:26:53] children but let us be obedient

[1:27:02] a lot of things in store for them that
[1:27:04] love him
[1:27:05] and god wants to bless you more than you

[1:27:10] if you only
[1:27:11] allow jesus christ

[1:36:09] about 40 years old he said my whole life
[1:36:12] nobody told me that they loved me
[1:36:15] he said and it's not an excuse for some
[1:36:17] of the crimes that he did but

[1:36:21] sympathy for different people for people
[1:36:23] we don't know people's situations amen
[1:36:26] so those different prisoners they would
[1:36:28] come to me with their stories and they
[1:36:29] would tell me and really it was
