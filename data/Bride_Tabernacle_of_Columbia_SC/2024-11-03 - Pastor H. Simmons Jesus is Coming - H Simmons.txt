and all those on the special list pray prayer list Lord PR special requests father I just pray that you help us this morning so we look to you now in Jesus name amen book of 2 Thessalonians 3 and 4 2 Thessalonians 3 and 4 familiar passage of scriptures with I believe with all my heart that Jesus is coming amen and we see signs all over the place sometime Jesus is coming perhaps they've been saying that over 2,000 years or more that Jesus is coming I think it's later than we think it is is we see the signs of the time these says here second Peter excuse second Peter excuse me three second Peter 3 I said 2 Thessalonians second Peter 3 and 4 and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as it were from the beginning of creation for this they're willingly ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens been of old and the Earth standed out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflooded with water perish but the heavens and earth which are now by the same word are kept in Store Reserve and Def fire against the day of judgment and prediction of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord is as a what th years and a thousand years as one the Lord is not slight concerning his what promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us were not willing that any should what perish but that all should come to what repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a what thief in the night thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great what noise and the elements should melt with the fervent what he and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be what burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what man of person ought ye ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasten until the what coming of the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall met with what nevertheless we according to his promise look for what new heav new where in dwelleth righteousness amen amen God bless the's word you may be seated amen amen I I know what I'm looking for amen praise God the world is not looking for Jesus to come but I am anticipating the coming of the Lorden and because he's coming back amen we got to prepare ourselves for his coming amen now in Revelation uh 1 and 7 it talks about you know a lot of uh Bible teachers talk about the appearance and talk about the presence and the parac and so forth and they're talking about the coming of the Lord in different forms you know and uh but by the grace of God whether it's it's appearance uh is he's here amen well one thing I know a lot of people are skeptical about uh God in Jesus and all but one thing I know he came amen now whether they're Muslims whether they're Hindus or whether they he had an impact on the whole world Jesus came now some uh the Muslim would say he just a prophet and they don't believe he's the son of God and they don't believe he was born of a virgin amen they believe he was just a man but nevertheless that being what that he did come amen and some people are confused amen and if he come he promis that he's coming again isn't that right as he departed he told his disciples don't let your heart be troubled amen believe in God believe also in me for In My Father's House in my father's Palace of many in my father Kingdom of many palaces amen if it were not so I would have told you I go to what I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am amen there you may be also amen he's coming he's coming and is soon coming came amen amen when he came the first time amen they said the amen that he was King of the Jews amen but he didn't come Amen to be king he came to be a sacrifice and to be offered up for the sins of the world amen amen are you with me amen but yet they thought that his coming was amen not as son of David some cried son of David because they knew that one day the son of David going to come and they look for that one to come to rule with a rod of iron amen amen they uh they said of the increase of his govern government and of his kingdom there shall be no end so they look to master at this time will you restore the kingdom to Israel will you amen reestablish the kingdom that Israel Haden so they look for the millennium but he came Amen to die on the cross for the sins of the world why they look for a lion he came as a lamb amen amen some folks amen thinking that he's going to forever be amen priest and mediator and intercessor but one day he's going to come as judge amen Jesus is coming amen amen some will look for his Mercy amen but sometimes amen while they're
