[33:33] we ask
[33:34] amen amen
[33:37] this time we asked you if you have your
[33:39] bibles to turn to the book of first
[33:42] thessalonians
[33:52] first thessalonians chapter 5
[33:55] and we'll start at verse 14.
[33:58] when you got to say amen
[34:08] and it reads now we exhort you brethren
[34:12] warn them that are unruly comfort the
[34:14] feeble-minded support the weak
[34:17] be patient towards all men
[34:20] see that none render evil for evil unto
[34:23] any man
[34:24] but ever follow that which is good
[34:27] both among yourself and to all men
[34:30] rejoice evermore pray without ceasing
[34:34] and everything give thanks but this is
[34:37] the will of god in christ jesus
[34:40] concerning you
[34:41] and man at this time man maybe he had a
[34:43] blessing to read those words you may be
[34:45] seated
[34:46] amen and man tonight i'd like to speak
[34:49] on a little topic that comes from the
[34:51] scripture verse 18 it says
[34:53] in everything give thanks
[34:56] in everything give thanks and
[34:59] the lord was dealing with me recently
[35:01] and just thinking about different things
[35:03] that's happening in life and people
[35:05] telling me different things and
[35:07] in every situation just to remember to
[35:09] give thanks
[35:11] even when it's going bad even when
[35:12] things are going at tops of turvy to
[35:14] give thanks because god is always good
[35:18] god is his mercy endures forever his
[35:20] truth
[35:21] is everlasting amen so
[35:23] in everything give thanks
[35:25] and everything to give thanks and no
[35:27] matter what what life may bring you can
[35:30] give thanks
[35:31] i thought about this thing that said
[35:33] what was what was my trial turned into
[35:35] my blessing
[35:37] what was my sickness turned into my
[35:39] healing things that i thought weren't
[35:41] going to be against me were actually for
[35:43] me but it was all about what i was
[35:45] thinking about while i was going through
[35:47] it and understanding that in everything
[35:50] i got to give thanks because i may can't
[35:52] see how it's ending but i know what it's
[35:54] going through while i'm in it so i have
[35:57] control over what i'm doing while i'm in
[35:59] this situation while i'm going through
[36:01] what i'm going through so i got to
[36:03] remember to give thanks because god is
[36:05] always good he's always good even when i
[36:08] don't think about it he's still good to
[36:10] me even when i may stumble and fall god
[36:13] is still good to me so i can always
[36:15] remember lord i gotta take time to think
[36:18] about to give you thanks
[36:20] no matter what may come what may go i
[36:22] gotta give you thanks
[36:24] amen we'll turn over to the book of
[36:26] daniel daniel chapter six
[36:28] i'm sure that you may be familiar with
[36:30] the story but
[36:32] i want to read something in daniel
[36:34] chapter six here
[36:40] and we'll start at verse
[36:42] we start at verse 1 daniel chapter 6 and
[36:45] verse 1 and when you got it say amen
[36:52] daniel chapter 6 and verse 1 and it says
[36:55] it please darius to set over the kingdom
[36:57] 120 princes which should be over the
[37:00] whole kingdom and over these three
[37:03] presidents of whom daniel was first that
[37:06] the princes might give account
[37:08] unto them and the kings should have no
[37:12] should have no damage verse 3
[37:14] then this daniel was preferred above the
[37:18] presidents and princes because the
[37:20] excellent spirit was in him
[37:22] and the king thought to set him over the
[37:24] whole realm
[37:26] then the presidents and the princes
[37:27] sought to find occasion against daniel
[37:30] concerned in the kingdom but they could
[37:32] not find
[37:33] none occasion nor fault for as much as
[37:36] he was faithful neither was there any
[37:38] error or fault found in him
[37:41] and it says then said these men we shall
[37:44] not find any occasion against this
[37:46] daniel except we find it against him
[37:48] concerning the law of his god
[37:51] then these presidents and princes
[37:53] assembled themselves together to the
[37:55] king and thus said unto him king darius
[37:58] live forever
[38:00] all the presidents of the kingdoms the
[38:02] governors and the princes and the
[38:04] councillors and the captains have
[38:06] consulted together to establish a royal
[38:09] statute and to make a fine decree that
[38:12] whomsoever shall ask a petition of any
[38:14] god
[38:15] or man for 30 days save of thee o king
[38:19] shall be cast into the den of lions see
[38:21] reading that just right there it showed
[38:23] that all
[38:24] everyone came against daniel it wasn't
[38:27] just one person wasn't two or three it
[38:29] was a whole collection that came against
[38:32] daniel and daniel if you read down
[38:34] further he said in verse 10
[38:36] he said now when daniel knew that the
[38:38] writing was signed
[38:40] he went into his house and his window
[38:42] being opened in his chamber towards
[38:44] jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[38:47] three times a day and prayed and gave
[38:50] thanks before his god as he did a fourth
[38:53] time
[38:54] it said even though daniel knew today
[38:56] they had signed this decree that you
[38:58] could not pray to ask anything besides
[39:01] of the king he still got down three
[39:03] times a day prayed and gave thanks
[39:06] he understood it was important for him
[39:08] to still give thanks no matter he knew
[39:10] that this was going to maybe come to his
[39:12] detriment this was coming may harm him
[39:15] in his natural but i can still get down
[39:17] and give god thanks because if the lord
[39:20] be for us who can be against you so
[39:22] you're understanding that daniel he knew
[39:24] that they were coming against them but
[39:26] he didn't care because he said god has
[39:28] been too good for me and brought me too
[39:30] far for me not to give them the praise
[39:32] and not to give them thanks
[39:34] and if you read down further and you see
[39:36] that daniel was thrown into the lion's
[39:38] den
[39:39] and the king because of because of the
[39:42] things that
[39:43] you see in verse 16 let me skip down
[39:45] there and read this and read this
[39:48] and the king commanded and they brought
[39:50] daniel and cast him in the denim of
[39:52] lions now the king spake and said unto
[39:55] daniel thy god whom thou service
[39:58] continually he will deliver thee
[40:01] he knew daniel always knew that the lord
[40:04] was on his side
[40:05] he knew that if he served them and he
[40:07] and he did what god asked him to do the
[40:10] lord would be with him if he never
[40:12] waving in his faith the lord would be
[40:14] with him so he could always give god
[40:16] thanks
[40:16] he can always have the opportunity to
[40:18] say lord i thank you for what you're
[40:20] doing for me i thank you for how what
[40:22] you gonna do for me even though i might
[40:25] can't see it i know that you're working
[40:26] for me i know that you're working for my
[40:29] good
[40:29] and understanding that daniel knew that
[40:32] even even in the lion's den god was with
[40:35] him
[40:36] even in the situation where it seemed
[40:38] hopeless he couldn't see no light he
[40:40] said the angel came down here and shut
[40:42] the lion's mouth he knew he knew that it
[40:45] was not his power but it was god's power
[40:47] that kept him he knew that it was
[40:49] something that was extraordinary came
[40:51] down and visited him in that lion's den
[40:54] that caused those lions to not eat him
[40:56] and consume him they said after they
[40:59] brought daniel out the king said now all
[41:01] them people that was complaining against
[41:03] daniel throw them in and their families
[41:06] and their children and before they could
[41:08] even touch the bottom of that pig they
[41:10] were destroyed
[41:12] before they could touch it and god can
[41:14] do the same thing to every enemy that
[41:16] comes against you if you only believe
[41:18] and you got to give god thanks even
[41:20] though you may can't see how it's going
[41:22] to end daniel didn't know that was going
[41:24] to happen to his enemies then daniel
[41:26] didn't know that they were going to be
[41:27] utterly destroyed and he would never
[41:28] have to deal with him again then he only
[41:30] knew that lord i'm going to give you
[41:32] thanks
[41:33] no matter what i'm going through and all
[41:35] that's what the scripture says and all
[41:36] things give thanks
[41:38] paul and he said i was reading something
[41:41] that says
[41:42] if we pray without ceasing we shall
[41:46] we shall not want matter without for
[41:49] thanksgiving and everything
[41:51] it as we must in everything make our
[41:53] requests known to god by supplications
[41:56] so we must not admit thanksgiving said
[41:59] it says and
[42:01] it says and i won't tell you to turn
[42:03] there but i'll read it
[42:05] really quickly it says in ephesians
[42:06] chapter 6
[42:08] if you're taking if you're writing it
[42:09] down
[42:10] it says in ephesians chapter 6 and verse
[42:13] and verse 18 it says praying always with
[42:16] all prayer and supplications in the
[42:17] spirit and watching them too with all
[42:20] perseverance and supplication for all
[42:22] saints so it's always when you're
[42:24] praying and i looked up the word
[42:26] supplications which is the root word is
[42:28] supplicating is to ask a big someone in
[42:32] a humble way
[42:33] to do or give something to pray
[42:36] to implore so sometimes you have to go
[42:39] and you have to be earnest in your
[42:41] prayer you have to be earnest and when
[42:43] you go you're giving thanksgiving from
[42:45] your heart
[42:46] not because lord i thank you and and
[42:48] then amen
[42:50] and and that's sometimes we get into the
[42:53] rehearsal then we make and it becomes
[42:55] automatic
[42:57] but sometimes you got to take it a
[42:58] little step slower and lower what am i
[43:00] thanking you for
[43:02] lord what am i thanking you for because
[43:04] there's so much to thank you for and by
[43:06] the time you get done lord i thank you
[43:07] for waking me up lord i thank you for
[43:10] keeping my mind lord i thank you for
[43:12] giving me breath to breathe thank you
[43:13] for health and strength thank you for
[43:15] keeping me from sicknesses and dangers
[43:18] and toils and snares and you keep on
[43:20] going down the line and your nose you
[43:22] you don't been there for 30 minutes just
[43:24] thanking god because he meant that good
[43:26] and in one moment since you woke up this
[43:28] morning he meant that good to you just
[43:30] today what about yesterday what about
[43:33] the day before and the day before that
[43:35] in the days in your future god has been
[43:37] that good so i can say thank you thank
[43:40] you in all things lord i got to give
[43:42] thanks because you've been that good to
[43:43] me i it just can't it makes me
[43:47] it gets it gets into you to you you want
[43:49] to say lord i i can't help but give you
[43:52] thanks
[43:53] i can't help but say thank you because
[43:55] there's nothing that i could do that i
[43:56] deserve this even when you think back
[43:59] lord you went to calvary for me
[44:01] you knew what i was going to do 2000
[44:03] years in advance and you still went
[44:05] there and died for me you went down
[44:07] there and shed your blood for a sinner
[44:09] like me
[44:10] knew that i was gonna make mistakes knew
[44:12] that i was gonna fall and you still made
[44:15] a way of escape for me to to to see
[44:18] heaven to be there with you to reign in
[44:20] eternity he still made a way
[44:23] and that's enough to thank him for the
[44:24] rest of my life
[44:26] that's enough to thank him and give god
[44:28] praise because he did that one small
[44:30] thing to give me an opportunity
[44:33] give me an opportunity to choose him
[44:35] amen now whether you choose them or not
[44:37] that's your choice
[44:39] that's your choice to live for them or
[44:40] not that's your choice but still you got
[44:43] to give god thanks for just the things
[44:45] that he does for you none of us can wake
[44:47] up on our own
[44:49] none of us can breathe on our own none
[44:51] of us create the oxygen in the air to
[44:53] continue to breathe none of us allow the
[44:56] world to continue to go allow us to live
[44:59] and none of us control whether we can
[45:01] work or not but god does
[45:03] god gives us strength to be able to get
[45:05] to work god give us the capacity to
[45:07] think to continue to do work god is the
[45:10] author of everything and he can give you
[45:12] everything that you need
[45:14] so
[45:14] and and just continue to just thank him
[45:16] for the small things
[45:18] some some things we trying to make god
[45:20] we we only want to thank god for the
[45:22] highs
[45:24] but never want to be thanking them when
[45:25] we in the lows
[45:27] they said i think about it it's as
[45:30] daniel was a consistent
[45:32] prayer
[45:33] he kept praying no matter whether he was
[45:35] high or whether he was low
[45:37] whether someone was looking whether
[45:39] someone wasn't when he was in his room
[45:41] by himself he was praying when he was in
[45:43] the courtyard with people he was praying
[45:45] he didn't make sure that everybody heard
[45:47] his prayer i think of the scripture
[45:49] where the pharisees he was up there and
[45:51] giving us high praise and and everyone
[45:53] he said and then one lady she came to
[45:56] the side on the side and said lord
[45:57] forgive me
[45:59] because i'm not worthy and that's the
[46:01] one the lord said that's the one and one
[46:03] it wasn't the one giving the loudest
[46:05] prayer it was the one that could reach
[46:06] god
[46:07] that could reach his throne and it could
[46:09] could touch his heart
[46:12] and is in is sometimes it's not about
[46:14] how loud you pray it's about coming with
[46:17] a sincere prayer it's coming with the
[46:19] earnest prayer lord i want you to do
[46:21] something for me lord i want to thank
[46:23] you for what you already done because i
[46:25] could have been places that i that i'm
[46:27] not and you still kept me but lord i
[46:29] need some more that you that i want you
[46:31] to do in my life lord i want you to
[46:33] touch me in some more in some greater
[46:35] ways cause i'm not satisfied where i am
[46:38] i'm not satisfied just
[46:40] just coming to church and barely making
[46:42] it holding on lord i want to know that
[46:44] you keeping me and that you will keep me
[46:47] for for
[46:48] forever until eternity and just turning
[46:50] those things over to god that he may get
[46:52] the glory not not anything that we can
[46:55] do or anything that we've done that he
[46:57] may get the glory and lord i want to say
[46:59] in all these things i want to continue
[47:02] to give you thanks
[47:03] and and everything that i'm going
[47:05] through i want to continue to give you
[47:07] things whether it's good whether it's
[47:09] bad whether it's up or whether it's down
[47:11] lord i still want to give you things
[47:13] because regardless you just you're still
[47:15] good
[47:16] regardless of whether it's high or
[47:18] whether it's low you're still good so i
[47:21] i can't i can't help but give you the
[47:23] praise and give you the honor and give
[47:25] you the thanks
[47:27] and paul says and
[47:29] paul says here in philippians he said
[47:32] he says
[47:33] for i have learned that in whatsoever
[47:35] state i am
[47:37] there with to be content
[47:40] paul had learned it through trials and
[47:41] tribulations in life that no matter what
[47:44] he was going through he had to
[47:46] understand that god put him through it
[47:48] for a reason
[47:49] even when the shipwrecked he said i
[47:51] didn't know i was going to go this way
[47:53] but god had a reason
[47:55] every every trial and tribulation every
[47:57] fall it's just a lesson to learn
[48:00] how to get back up
[48:02] everything i like to say this thing i
[48:04] said you can never understand true
[48:07] success until you've had true failure
[48:10] you you don't understand what it's like
[48:13] to sit on the mountaintop and be
[48:14] thankful for god placing you there until
[48:17] you've been in the valley you don't
[48:19] understand what it means
[48:22] how to appreciate an a if you never made
[48:24] a lower grade if you never made less
[48:27] than an a you then you don't appreciate
[48:28] the a the same because this is what i
[48:30] always get
[48:31] this is what i always achieve so this is
[48:33] normal but when you earn something lower
[48:36] than that then when you get back up to
[48:38] that level and you get back up to that
[48:40] hey you you appreciative you say oh
[48:41] thank you jesus
[48:43] thank you thank you jesus i i thought i
[48:44] wasn't gonna make it this far but lord
[48:46] you brought me through and when you when
[48:49] you take that test and you're just like
[48:50] lord
[48:52] i need your help because i didn't
[48:53] understand what was going on and the
[48:56] lord still bring you through all you can
[48:58] do is say thank you jesus because he's
[49:00] done so much to bring you through that
[49:02] and you know that didn't mean that you
[49:04] shouldn't study
[49:07] the bible says study to show that
[49:09] self-approved
[49:10] you should still study but some things
[49:12] you got to lean on the lord and he'll
[49:14] bring you through so i can give him the
[49:16] thanks because of what he's done and how
[49:18] he's brought me through and
[49:20] understanding that and whatsoever state
[49:22] i am i'm in that's where i'll be content
[49:25] and lord i can give you the praise no
[49:27] matter whether it's high whether it's
[49:28] low whether it's going good whether it's
[49:31] not going as well as i thought it would
[49:32] be because many a times it's not about
[49:37] it's not about what we're going through
[49:39] it's what we where we thought we would
[49:40] be
[49:41] that we are disappointed
[49:43] we thought that we were further along
[49:45] than where we may be at and god
[49:47] sometimes you have to take us on the
[49:49] children of israel experience
[49:51] in the wilderness and make you go around
[49:53] because you ain't learned your lesson
[49:54] yet
[49:55] and make you go back around because you
[49:57] didn't have the right attitude when you
[49:59] came to the lesson the second time and
[50:01] make you go back around until you decide
[50:03] you know what lord i i need to get on my
[50:05] knees for this one because because it
[50:07] this ain't fixing my problem i thought i
[50:09] could you know do this and do that and
[50:11] it didn't work and then i tried this
[50:13] that and it didn't work so eventually i
[50:15] got to get to the point lord i want to
[50:16] give you the honor and give you the
[50:18] thanks for bringing me this far
[50:20] and still allowing me the opportunity to
[50:23] to continue on because some people don't
[50:26] get that opportunity
[50:28] some people they it's they only get one
[50:29] chance
[50:31] they only get one chance to get it right
[50:34] but sometimes if god is calling you they
[50:36] say respond if god call you again
[50:41] that's a more opportunity to respond god
[50:43] really love you
[50:45] because he comes back and gives you
[50:47] another opportunity he gives you another
[50:49] opportunity to show you that he's still
[50:51] good to you
[50:53] he's still good to you he's still
[50:54] watching over you he's still keeping you
[50:57] and he still wants you to give him the
[50:59] thanks and the praise and the honor and
[51:00] the glory and he's showing you that
[51:03] there's more opportunity for you to get
[51:05] it right there's an opportunity and a
[51:07] chance for you for you to grow closer to
[51:10] him there's an opportunity and chance
[51:12] that you can still give him the thanks
[51:14] you can still give him the praise and
[51:16] just understanding that some things are
[51:19] meant to
[51:20] to build character in you
[51:23] there was nothing that you did and
[51:24] didn't deserve it it was nothing that
[51:27] that but it was built something in you
[51:29] sometimes the lord job didn't deserve
[51:31] what he went through
[51:33] he didn't deserve it but god knew that
[51:36] no matter what he was going through he
[51:38] still was going to honor him
[51:39] he still was going to give him the
[51:41] thanks because god he knew that the lord
[51:43] gave it and the lord taketh away blessed
[51:46] be the name of the lord so job
[51:48] understood no matter what i'm going
[51:49] through i can still got an opportunity
[51:52] to give god thanks he got the boys on
[51:54] the skin and lost everything and he he
[51:56] still well i got breath that i'm
[51:58] breathing i'm still alive that's enough
[52:00] to give god thanks because i'm still
[52:03] alive i could have been dead like them
[52:05] but god allowed me to still live on and
[52:07] god honored that and gave him double
[52:09] what he had before and everything you
[52:12] can give thanks because these are just
[52:14] opportunities for us to see
[52:16] how god
[52:17] continually to honor
[52:19] the praises and the glory that you give
[52:21] him
[52:22] he continues to watch over you and keep
[52:25] you even when you ain't when you're not
[52:27] even thinking about it when you lay down
[52:29] to go to sleep he he allows you to wake
[52:31] up in the morning when when when you're
[52:33] in your car he allows
[52:35] he watches over your car he watches over
[52:38] everything
[52:39] i said lord sometimes i pray when i get
[52:41] in my car i said i know i'd only pray
[52:43] for my safety i pray for my car as well
[52:48] i said lord watch over me and the car
[52:50] because
[52:51] sometimes you want god
[52:53] you're praying for your safety you
[52:55] didn't pray for your car
[52:56] he said lord watch over that as well
[52:59] and every time that you make it to your
[53:01] destination that's an opportunity to say
[53:03] thank you
[53:04] there's so many opportunities to split
[53:05] seconds judgments that you never saw
[53:08] where god was keeping you
[53:10] he was keeping you on the short distance
[53:12] from here to the stop sign god still
[53:14] kept you there's so many people that
[53:17] have massive heart attacks in the car
[53:19] driving and that's it
[53:22] and
[53:23] how do you stop that except for god keep
[53:25] you
[53:26] except for god watch over you so in
[53:28] everything i can look and say lord i can
[53:30] give you thanks
[53:31] i can give you thanks no matter what
[53:33] state i'm in no matter where i'm at lord
[53:36] i can give you thanks because you've
[53:37] been that good
[53:39] you've been that good many times i
[53:40] didn't think this was where i i was
[53:42] going to be but this is where you place
[53:44] me so i can still give thanks
[53:47] because you just using this to teach me
[53:49] a lesson
[53:50] using the sickness for my healing to
[53:53] teach me that you are a healer
[53:55] you're using the the trial to show me
[53:57] that you can bless me
[53:59] you're using these things to show me
[54:01] that you got something greater than what
[54:03] i can think or i can even imagine so i
[54:06] can go ahead and give you thanks for the
[54:08] greater because i know it's coming
[54:10] whether i get it here or whether i get
[54:12] it there it don't matter
[54:13] the greater is there for me and i can
[54:15] arrive and i can achieve it so on
[54:17] everything i can give thanks amen god
[54:20] bless you
[54:31] hey man you appreciate the word tonight
[54:33] amen
[54:34] [Applause]
[54:37] and everything give thanks amen
[54:40] i appreciate that word tonight of god
[54:42] always gives us a word in season doesn't
[54:44] he
[54:44] you know when you think about
[54:46] when brother caleb was ministering
[54:48] tonight i was thinking about something i
[54:49] was telling
[54:50] charlotte before we came to church
[54:52] tonight i was saying you know
[54:54] i was telling about a situation not long
[54:56] ago where somebody hugged me
[54:58] and they held me and they wouldn't let
[55:00] me go
[55:01] tears was coming down the eyes
[55:03] and i told them i said i know it's heavy
[55:05] right now
[55:06] because they're going through so much
[55:08] right now
[55:09] and i told them i said i know it's heavy
[55:11] and i thought about that i says because
[55:14] i was telling them that
[55:15] you know you got to give your life to
[55:17] god
[55:18] and give it to him
[55:20] that's that's the best
[55:22] options that i can give you
[55:24] but
[55:26] i told them i know it's heavy but i was
[55:28] thinking about that just just now
[55:30] tonight i says you know
[55:31] sometimes situations are heavy
[55:34] you know
[55:35] sometimes when you're coming up in life
[55:37] you don't realize the trials you're
[55:39] going to have to go through
[55:41] you don't see the road ahead of you
[55:43] you don't see what's what's up ahead
[55:46] some heaviest heavy roads
[55:49] heavy loads you're gonna have to carry
[55:51] but god builds you up for it
[55:54] that when you get to it remember he said
[55:55] i'll put no more on you then you can do
[55:57] what
[55:58] bear
[55:59] i preached the message one time
[56:01] what god allows
[56:04] nothing can't happen to you except for
[56:05] what god allow
[56:06] ain't that ain't that right and if god
[56:09] allowed it
[56:11] even though it's heavy
[56:13] sometimes you got to find a way when
[56:14] it's heavy
[56:16] to reach your hands out
[56:18] you got to find a way when it's heavy to
[56:20] say lord thank you anyhow
[56:23] find a way when it's heavy to press your
[56:25] way to church
[56:27] press your way through
[56:28] all of the heaviness

[56:40] gonna bring them out
[56:42] hallelujah we got something to thank god
[56:44] for tonight don't we hallelujah
[56:47] you know i'm stirred i thought about
[56:49] that scripture

[56:53] they worshiped him not didn't they
[56:55] and the bible said neither were they
[56:56] what thankful
[56:58] come on we find that today don't we
[57:01] people ain't thankful
[57:03] and god is so good ain't it
[57:05] you know was having bible study last
[57:07] night and we were talking about
[57:10] uh knowing the flood and my son aaron
[57:14] he sleep tonight he missed it
[57:16] he said he began to say dad i thought
[57:20] god was good
[57:22] i said god is good
[57:24] he just hates sin
[57:26] don't he
[57:28] come on god is good and he long
[57:30] suffering too
[57:31] ain't it
[57:32] he gives us so many opportunities don't
[57:34] he
[57:35] makes covenants with us blesses us so
[57:38] much god is good
[57:40] but the people ain't thankful
[57:42] they don't appreciate god
[57:44] come on he's unwelcome today ain't he oh
[57:48] hallelujah come on people don't want to
[57:50] talk about that do they you say how you
[57:53] how is he unwelcome how do you reject
[57:55] them when you reject the word
[57:57] come on preachers pour their heart out a
[57:59] lot of times don't they
[58:00] people don't want god
[58:02] do they
[58:03] neither were they thankful
[58:05] but i say tonight be thankful be
[58:08] thankful that you got the breath of life
[58:10] be thankful that god has brought you
[58:12] from a mighty long way
[58:14] come on you know i thought about that
[58:16] scripture that david said that i believe
[58:19] it was david he said i always thought
[58:21] that the wicked prosper
[58:23] he said until i come into what he said i
[58:25] come to the house of the lord and i saw
[58:27] the end god showed me the end come on
[58:30] they ain't getting away come on but god
[58:32] is bringing us through something right
[58:33] now come on he's purging us ain't he
[58:37] testing us and trying us right now that
[58:38] when we come out we'll be his pure gold
[58:41] and i thank god for every trial
[58:43] i believe it was a hundred crowd said it
[58:45] all the
[58:46] the trials and the
[58:48] valleys and the mountains i know i'm
[58:50] messing it all up but he said all those
[58:51] things that i've been through he says
[58:53] but if i never had a problem come on
[58:56] i wouldn't knew that god would solve him
[58:58] did he wouldn't i wouldn't know what
[59:00] faith in god would do hallelujah i don't
[59:03] know about you but i'm stirred does it
[59:05] hurt when you go through yes it hurts
[59:08] is it heavy yes it's heavy
[59:10] but we made it through it how do we make
[59:12] it through it because god brought us
[59:14] through it he brought us to it and he
[59:16] brought us through it that's why we can
[59:18] praise god today hallelujah
[59:20] amen did you feel all right today come
[59:22] on
[59:24] god is a good god ain't it
[59:26] make you
[59:27] make you just get joy all in your heart
[59:29] darn it brother kelly
[59:31] come on up and say something tonight
[59:33] i looked round he didn't have his towel
[59:35] usually we let the visiting ministers we
[59:38] pull them on up come on and get out the
[59:40] way how many thank god tonight amen
[59:43] i said giving thanks say man that was a
[59:46] a good word that we heard tonight and
[59:48] all things give thanks
[59:50] i thought about this week you know i was
[59:52] sitting there i was at work and you know
[59:54] sometimes just out there talking with
[59:56] the guys and you know you can get a
[59:58] little loose but i think i said
[1:00:00] something and as soon as it came out of
[1:00:03] my mouth conviction fell on me
[1:00:06] and i said lord i couldn't tell the
[1:00:08] people what i was going through because
[1:00:10] they say what that wasn't nothing but
[1:00:11] the holy ghost began to convict you you
[1:00:13] know what i did stop what i was doing i
[1:00:16] went out to the car and i began to bow
[1:00:18] my head and i began to pray
[1:00:20] i said lord i said create in me a clean
[1:00:22] heart
[1:00:24] and renew the right spirit in me i begin
[1:00:26] to quote that scripture cast me not away
[1:00:28] from thy presence so lord don't you know
[1:00:30] god could cut you off at any time i
[1:00:33] began to say lord don't take your holy
[1:00:34] spirit away from me come on but what it
[1:00:36] is i want that joy come on
[1:00:39] that i might be able to praise you you
[1:00:41] know you can't praise god when your joy
[1:00:43] ain't right
[1:00:44] come on when your spirit ain't right you
[1:00:46] can't praise god you can't come in the
[1:00:47] house and get god to get that
[1:00:49] breakthrough that you want i mean that
[1:00:51] you need when your spirit ain't right
[1:00:52] come on but when your spirit is right
[1:00:54] when you laid it all before the altar
[1:00:56] come on it don't take much hallelujah
[1:00:59] for god to come down and do something in
[1:01:01] your heart you believe that tonight amen
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:11] praise the lord saints
[1:01:13] and that's shame on me for not coming
[1:01:14] with my tie huh
[1:01:18] but the lord saw this day before the
[1:01:19] foundation of the world i tell you about
[1:01:22] caleb i was about to i i tested the
[1:01:24] first time i ever heard him share some
[1:01:26] words
[1:01:27] but you know i tell you you see what god
[1:01:29] is doing
[1:01:30] when you see what god is doing
[1:01:33] you see we know it was going to be a
[1:01:35] time it no matter who it is including
[1:01:38] myself paul says if anyone else he said
[1:01:41] include himself come and preach any

[1:01:48] ministers you get behind them you pray
[1:01:51] for them you stand with them in this

[1:03:47] he was going through something that was
[1:03:49] his personal testimony he knew some time
[1:03:52] when he was weary and he know he had an
