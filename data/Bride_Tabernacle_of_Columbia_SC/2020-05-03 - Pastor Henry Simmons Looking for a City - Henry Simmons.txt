god i can't feel at home in this world anymore the book of hebrews 11th chapter the eighth verse life here is fleeing it's very short the bible says the days of a man life is three school years and ten and by reason the strength to be four school years somebody talks about and then when this life is over we'll fly away here in hebrews 11 8 said by faith abraham when he was called to go out until a place which he should have to receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he's adjourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with eyes and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which builds those which had foundation whose builder and maker is god looking for a city you may be seated looking for a city we heard god's servant talked about the future home and by the grace of god there is a future home for you and i for all those that love his appearance god has a place prepared for you and i [Music] there is a future home and as we think about that future home that god has gone away to prepare a place for you and i abraham looked for a city and i was looking and our anticipation we're looking for a city see in looking for the city we must recognize not what's going to be things that ought to be but we want not only to look at things that ought to be but the things that are for solomon altman said that which has been is now and he said that which is the bee has already been and he said there is nothing new under the sun so as we look at the old testament it was a type and shadow of things to come and i believe that god never left himself without witness so here in looking for the city in the same 11 i mean in the 12th chapter maybe i'll just read revelation excuse me revelation 21 revelation 21 and 1 looking for a city hopefully we can just lay a foundation here if i don't get too excited what i was getting excited about in prior yesterday it was i was thinking about our lord and i was thinking about and that song came into my heart he's a waymaker one day he made it away from me i believe he made the bible say the builder and maker is gone he's a way maker i thought about when they sing the song and when they oftentimes we hear him say that he'll make a way out of nowhere [Music] when there's no way he'll make a way my mind went back and looked at the children of israel as there was no waste [Music] when the mountains in the army was behind them in the sea was in front of them amen he will make a way god amen made a way said stand still oh yes brother and sister i don't know what you're going through today ah but god is away makeup yes he will he'll make a way for you we got a god that can make a way you know sometimes the light journey seems to be very amen close in on you sometimes amen and things amen began to be amen somewhat pressurized and we don't know what to do with our circumstances and our situation sometimes amen and sometimes we can't see how things are going to get better i thought about uh uh what we're going through now and i said lord amen in the midst of the crisis that we face the economical crisis uh uh the sickness in the uh this uh corona virus amen in the midst of all that we're going through how can things get better i like to encourage you this morning but he will make a way somehow amen he'll make a way for you well that seemed no way hallelujah he will make a way the bible says that there's no temptation taking us with such as common demand but god with the temptation make a way for us to escape yes he'll make a way [Music] amen of escape praise god i'll tell you it might seem like amen amen the world is closely closing in around you but god will make a way somebody need to see that amen through your darkest hours amen the sun is shining on the other side of the clouds amen and i want you to know the sun is still down and i want you to know not to ask you in son but they are so in son jesus is still there [Music] and he'll make a way for you praise god he'll make a way amen i was so stirred up and amen i realized the largest servant when the syrian army was all around the bottom and uh amen and the servant says amen he thought that it was all over and the enemy was closing in on them and um he elijah said they that's with us is more than them against and the servant couldn't understand and the lord elijah said open his eyes amen i hope somebody eyes will be opened today to realize that he has made a way oh your eyes just got to open up amen and see what the lord has done oh yes he's doing something he'll make a way he has made a way for those that can look beyond amen what to sing and look to the unseen hey i see where my help come from amen put on your faith amen eye glasses and see amen the things that ought to be let me see what the lord has done let it look to calvary's cross and look to the blood of jesus and you said to death hell in the grave you are defeated [Music] hallelujah the blood against you the blood of jesus is against the coronavirus the blood of jesus is against every demon in devil that may attack your mind come against you oh yes hallelujah he'll make a way out of no way hey your victory your help is in the name of the lord all you got to do trust in the lord amen believe that he will [Music] make a way for you hallelujah i don't know who needed that but god knows i needed it amen there's someone that needed a word from the law he'll make a way put your trust in him now let me go to revelation 21 amen god is good amen i

patient praise god you got to make the best of your trip you only got one life to live in one way one time to pass this way why don't you enjoy passing through this way are you up man praise god come and weep and moan and groan about what you're missing out on amen what fluff folks going through you don't want that amen but you need to thank the lord god ain't you good amen i don't have to wake up in the morning going through what some folks that call joy going through they meant to hang over and amen all the frust oh lord have mercy but god has a city no more death amen because there'll be no more sin no death neither sorrow or you would be praise god it's something about amen sorrow comes sometime but there won't be no more sorrow in that city amen and brothers and sisters i want to let you know that a glimpse of glory god has allowed you and i to experience amen a way that god has provided a city of refuge a place that we can go amen and feel heaven presence you know i i i said oh lord good you know in prayer i said lord i wish people can experience this this the spirit it's something about the presence of god and you just get in that presence and hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and all you feel is one wave after another wave and the presence of god and the glory see most people don't get they don't they don't know how to enter into the presence of god and when they enter into the presence of god you don't want to leave out of the presence of god and some folk hadn't hadn't experienced god's presence god's anointing amen they get in god's anointing and you caught up in another dimension in another place and your god is speaking to your spirit and god is dealing with your heart and god is elevating you and he is telling you things to come are you with me brother and sister there is a city oh lord no sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain amen don't look at your pain amen look at the city look at the one that said that i take away your pain i take sickness and death and sorrow all that away from you for he said the formal things are passed away you know god can sweep in and just let all our weeping may endure for a night but you are coming in the morning said many of the affliction of the righteous but the lord shall deliver them out of them all god just move it just sweep it away ain't god good what he promised to do in that city he does it temporary for us now are you a man because you were temporarily experiencing heavenly places in christ jesus but your temporary state will come into your eternal state are you with me because when you come into christ you stepped out of time you stepped into eternity amen and we step out the cosmos the world order and so forth and we step into eternity oh you look man so this is what this is what god is saying to you and i i'm giving you a place now that you can dwell i'm giving you cities he gave them six cities of refuge that if you happen to make an axe accident and kill somebody by accident you can flee to those cities amen but the only thing about fleeing to those cities you had to stay there because the avenger of blood was after you and if he catch up with you before you make it to the city amen then he can kill you i'ma tell him run for your life get in the city and when you get in the city the avenger that devil can't get to you because the city is a holy city he can't come in there amen i said get in the baptism of the holy ghost the devil can't get in the baptism on the holy ghost because he can't get there the only way he can get to you he got to have the holy ghost and the devil can't get the holy ghost you what man as long as you abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will and i do it the holy ghost amen that cap about them the angels of the lord it might be uh 200 000 thousand demons that let loose out of euphrates amen but there's an innumerable company of angels round about you amen this city got angels guarding the city are you with me thank god for the angels god in the tree of life amen the cherubims amen guarding the way to the tree of life praise god i wanted i wonder where that tree is now with those cherubims guarding that tree amen somebody said matthew mark luke and john are you up there and in the midst is the book of acts in order to come into the book of acts you got to come by the gospel you got to come by the blood of jesus and in the blood of jesus you come back to the tree of life amen and no devil can get in there because they got to come by the blood are you up there ain't god
