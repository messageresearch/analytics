[44:52] And we're living in a a a society, in a
[44:56] time where the church
[44:59] want to see God move, but they lost the
[45:03] key.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; They want to see, Amen. the the
[45:08] miraculous take place, but they lost the
[45:11] key.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; The key. Amen. Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Now, um the reason why we have lost the
[45:20] key, Amen, to the door, Amen,
[45:24] because the key is used to lock and
[45:26] unlock, right?
[45:29] &gt;&gt; So, the reason why the church as a whole
[45:32] has lost the key,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; there's a lack of faith.
[45:39] The Bible tells us in Hebrews, he that
[45:41] cometh to God must first of all believe.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; That he is and he is a rewarder of them
[45:47] that diligently seek him.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; He said without faith it's impossible
[45:54] &gt;&gt; to please him. Isn't that right?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. With without faith, YOU
[46:00] DON'T YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE IS whether
[46:02] or not the Amen. the church is going to
[46:06] trust God. UH-HUH.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; HAVE CONFIDENCE in God and faith in God.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; BUT WHETHER OR NOT WE JUST WANT TO come
[46:15] Amen. and uh just COME AND FELLOWSHIP
[46:17] AND HAVE uh communion is just like a
[46:21] it's a ritual a tradition OR HAVING JUST
[46:24] A CLUB
[46:25] &gt;&gt; OR SOME TYPE OF RELIGIOUS SOCIETY
[46:29] &gt;&gt; OR do but we're NOT HERE AMEN. JUST TO
[46:32] COME TRADITIONALLY. WE WANT TO SEE GOD.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH YEAH.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE GOD IN OUR LIVES. WE WANT
[46:39] TO SEE GOD IN OUR MIDST.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST GOING THROUGH THE FORM
[46:44] AND AMEN. THINKING THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT
[46:46] TO SING. IT'S ALL RIGHT TO AMEN. JUST TO
[46:49] HAVE CHURCH.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE GOD.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; So we would see Jesus.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; The trial.
[47:00] Your faith will be tested.
[47:04] Your faith will be tested and tried.
[47:08] YOU KNOW WHY? NOW THE Bible tells us
[47:11] that faith come by what?
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Hearing.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And hearing by the what?
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Word of God.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; The word OF GOD. NOW WHEN THE WORD
[47:20] SPEAKS.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE TELLS US THAT MAN SHALL NOT
[47:26] LIVE by bread ALONE BUT BY WHAT?
[47:29] &gt;&gt; EVERY WORD.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; EVERY WORD that proceeded OUT OF THE
[47:32] MOUTH OF GOD. WE THINK THAT WE CAN GET
[47:34] BY JUST DOING SOME.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; I JUST DO AS MUCH as I, you know, you
[47:42] know, if I don't, IF I DON'T LIKE THAT
[47:44] PART, I JUST PUT IT TO THE SIDE.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; But you got to Amen. obey every word.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU REJECT PART OF THE WORD,
[47:54] ANY WORD,
[47:56] AMEN. YOU'RE REJECTING GOD.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GO AHEAD. Then how can you have
[48:01] faith IN HIM YOU NOT HEARD? AND HOW CAN
[48:05] YOU HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; AND HOW CAN HE PREACH EXCEPT he be sent?
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:14] &gt;&gt; I was telling
[48:16] because it's a it's a great problem.
[48:18] People are he said why people can't come
[48:20] on one accord. See before you can come
[48:23] on one accord WITH ONE ANOTHER YOU GOT
[48:25] to become on one accord with God.
[48:28] Uh-huh.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:30] &gt;&gt; IT TALKS ABOUT THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[48:33] They were all in one place and Amen. And
[48:36] then suddenly there came a sound from
[48:38] heaven. Amen. That they was in one place
[48:41] and they was on ONE ACCORD.
[48:44] AMEN. AND THEN THE HOLY GHOST FELL.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE GOT TO GET ON ONE ACCORD,
[48:49] NOT WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT WITH GOD. I
[48:53] THINK WE'RE TOO BUSY TRYING TO GET ON
[48:55] ONE CALL WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT WITH
[48:57] GOD.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO GET ON ONE ACCORD WITH THE
[49:00] CHURCH OR WITH THE BISHOP OR WITH THIS
[49:02] ONE OR THAT ONE AND NOT WITH THE WORD.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[49:06] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; WE MUST BECOME ON ONE ACCORD WITH THE
[49:09] WORD OF GOD.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; IF THE WORD SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO DON'T believe it.
[49:16] I believe THE WORD.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE ITSELF is all absolute. Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible. Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. IT DON'T NOBODY TAKES THE
[49:28] PLACE OF THE BIBLE.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; NO PREACHER, NO CHURCH, AMEN. NO BISHOP,
[49:33] NO WHO? I DON'T CARE WHAT.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; NO PROPHET, NOBODY TAKES THE PLACE OF
[49:38] THE BIBLE.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE IS YOUR ABSOLUTE.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; SEE, faith come by hearing.
[49:50] and and and we we we say we preaching on
[49:52] faith, but you got to know that faith
[49:56] come by hearing and hearing the word of
[49:57] God.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Now, when you doubt just one
[50:02] &gt;&gt; just one word,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; just one word in the Bible
[50:06] &gt;&gt; caused all the sin.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; The devil convinced Eve that she wasn't
[50:11] going to die.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Uh if you you ain't going to die. Just
[50:19] no. You're not going to die.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; God said the day you eat, you going to
[50:23] die.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:26] &gt;&gt; If she knew that you WAS GOING TO DIE
[50:29] AND cause all the sin and all the
[50:31] corruption. Amen. And people always say,
[50:35] "Well, Adam this and that and that." The
[50:38] Bible say Adam was not deceived,
[50:40] but the woman was deceived.
[50:44] Amen. Being in the transgression.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why he said,
[50:49] "Amen. Let your women
[50:52] learn in silence with all suggestion."
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we don't have women
[50:56] preachers.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Because, Amen. She was equal with Adam
[51:00] at the beginning.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Now, he going to be your
[51:03] head."
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Are y'all Are y'all with me?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; The man is going to be the head because
[51:12] she messed up.
[51:14] Now you said, "Why Adam going to be a
[51:15] head?" He messed up, too. That's God's
[51:18] business.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; You leave God alone. He know what he
[51:23] doing.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I ain't got no problem with it.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Anybody got any problem with the word?
[51:33] &gt;&gt; We going to tell God how to do things.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God said it. I believe it.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; So, by the grace of God, see, people
[51:43] have problem with God. Why did God say
[51:45] this? Why did God I don't believe he
[51:48] meant that. I don't Nope. Every word
[51:51] that proceeded out of the mouth of God.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Whether you understand it or not,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; if God said it, I believe it.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Now,
[52:05] let me go back over here in Peter. He
[52:08] says in the seventh verse, he says, "So
[52:12] many good things up above till I if I
[52:14] did it, I'll be here." Oh, oh, a long
[52:18] time. He says, I do the fourth verse.
[52:23] Oh, okay. Thank you.
[52:26] Oh, I go to the third verse. Oh,
[52:28] goodness. Let me go to the second one
[52:30] then.
[52:32] Okay. He said, "Elect according to the
[52:35] full knowledge of God the Father through
[52:37] sanctification of the spirit." Sometime
[52:40] folk don't want to be sanctified.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Sanctification come Amen. by God. You
[52:49] got to be sanctified.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; God want to wash you clean. You sanctify
[52:55] them through thy truth. He said thy
[52:58] what?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Word.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; The word is truth. Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing wrong with being
[53:03] sanctified. Let God wash you with the
[53:05] water OF THE WORD. LET GOD CLEAN YOU UP.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Somebody say, "I don't need to be
[53:11] washed."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wash us from our filthiness.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "Amen. Cleanse us
[53:20] from all filthiness of the flesh and the
[53:22] spirit
[53:23] &gt;&gt; that we might perfect holiness in the
[53:26] fear of God."
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes, sir.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Because we got a father that requires
[53:31] that.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. I I got to get until until the
[53:36] obedience and the sprinkling of the
[53:38] blood of Jesus Christ. Grace be unto
[53:40] you.
[53:43] You think he's talking to them back
[53:45] there and not talking to you?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I believe he's talking to us, too.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; You and peace be multiplied. Blessed be
[53:54] God in the father of our Lord Jesus
[53:56] Christ which according to his abundant
[53:59] mercy has begotten us again unto a what?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[54:06] the dead to a what?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. You have an inherit I I
[54:13] I know you're talking to me cuz I I'm
[54:15] receiving that.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[54:19] incorruptible.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes me excited. Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You're not serving the Lord FOR NOTHING.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS promised you something.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And you must Amen. RECOGNIZE GOD HAS
[54:32] PROMISED ME SOMETHING. I'M NOT SERVING
[54:35] the Lord for nothing.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY GOD HAS PROMISED ME AN
[54:39] INHERITANCE.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; An inheritance incorruptible.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And it's what?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; It's undefiled. And it what? Faith is
[54:51] not
[54:52] &gt;&gt; faith is not in his reserve.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; It's waiting on me.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I GO TO PREPARE A place for
[55:00] you that where I am, there ye may be
[55:04] also."
[55:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S RESERVED FOR YOU.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; You ain't excited.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If somebody Amen. uh
[55:14] somebody had a couple billion dollars
[55:16] and said, "Amen. Praise God. you have I
[55:19] I'm going to give you so and so. I'm
[55:21] going to give you a few 10 million
[55:24] and and you don't be excited.
[55:29] SEE THE REASON WHY the church is not
[55:32] excited because they not they think God
[55:36] speaking to somebody else.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHEN WE KNOW GOD is speaking to
[55:40] us, it gives us SOMETHING TO BE EXCITED
[55:43] ABOUT.

[56:02] &gt;&gt; But you feel like it, Lord,
[56:06] but you ain't talking to me. You're
[56:09] talking to somebody. It look like it's
[56:11] foreign somewhere off somewhere. It's a
[56:14] distance. It's distant from us. But when
[56:16] it becomes real to you,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; when your faith can say, "Lord, thank
[56:22] you."
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Your faith is saying, "Lord, you're
[56:25] speaking to me."
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I believe that's me
[56:30] &gt;&gt; that you're talking to.

[59:22] don't have it.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But it's free.
[59:26] All you got to do is repent
[59:28] &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[59:30] Jesus Christ.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; You shall receive
[59:34] &gt;&gt; the gift of the Holy Ghost.

[1:00:22] Caleb, I said, "Your turn to preach, but
[1:00:25] I believe I'll take over."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; I said, "I'm greatly rejoicing."
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got up early. I I said, "It's

[1:00:51] for me. Been in so much pain. I couldn't
[1:00:54] hardly I couldn't get sleep and Amen.

[1:01:20] I said, "Let me just ask."
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I went on preaching uh going on down the
[1:01:26] Mullins in so much pain. I come to the
[1:01:29] pool pit. Amen. I was still in pain.
[1:01:33] Praise God. I still had a little bit of
[1:01:35] pain left on Friday night.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God. Amen. I said,
[1:01:40] "Y'all pray for me."
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe somebody said,
[1:01:44] "Lord, have mercy on pastor.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on him." Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God heard somebody prayer.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY I'M REJOICING.

[1:01:59] WAS IN, YOU HAD SOMETHING TO PRAISE THE
[1:02:02] LORD ABOUT.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; OH GOD, I CAN JUMP AROUND NOW.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:12] My wife said, "You've been doing your
[1:02:14] ups and downs." I said, "I ain't been

[1:03:16] pounds so we were playing our rival
[1:03:19] Booger T Washington. So they went and

[1:03:23] look big and they put on the thing I
[1:03:26] wore

[1:20:08] THAT KNOWS IT ALL. THE ONE THAT CAN FIX
[1:20:12] THINGS. GOD, THE ONE THAT COULD TURN
[1:20:14] THINGS AROUND. I TRUST IN HIM.

[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; That's who I'm trusting in.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; God just trying to say, "Let me fix it
[1:20:35] for you. Give it to me.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me fix it for you.
[1:20:42] Praise God. Now you can go through
[1:20:44] counseling. You can go to the
[1:20:47] psychiatrist, the psychologist,
[1:20:51] you can go to the doctor,
[1:20:53] the neology and psychology and
[1:20:58] himmology,
[1:21:00] but go to neology.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Don't forget to go to neology.
[1:21:09] Just take time to kneel down and and
[1:21:13] say, "God, I'm letting this thing go in
[1:21:16] your hands."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Cuz you can do what no
[1:21:20] other doctor,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; no psychiatrist, no psychology, no Oh
[1:21:26] Lord,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; If Jesus can't fix it,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; nobody can.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] My oh Lord,
[1:21:45] I was looking at my time piece.
[1:21:48] It says in a verse,
[1:21:52] whom having not what?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Seen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say seeing is believing.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And whom having not seen? You know,
[1:22:02] sometimes you want to see angels just
[1:22:04] to, you know, look beyond and see the
[1:22:08] supernatural realm and see out in the
[1:22:10] spiritual realm. You want to look
[1:22:12] sometimes, you know, in our agonizing,
[1:22:15] in our fasting and praying, we want to
[1:22:18] see that supernatural being appear
[1:22:20] before us. Lord, if I can only see an
[1:22:23] angel, Lord, I want to I want to know,
[1:22:26] Amen. I want to know for sure, Amen,
[1:22:29] that Amen. that that there's angels,
[1:22:32] there are supernatural beings, and I
[1:22:34] want to see one.
[1:22:36] Sometimes you go and you agonize before
[1:22:38] God, and you want to see it, and
[1:22:41] sometimes God just says, "Amen,
[1:22:44] I I'm going to show you by manifesting
[1:22:49] myself in meeting your need, your
[1:22:51] situation."
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And you know, somebody did that.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God start talking to you
[1:22:58] sometime because physically
[1:23:02] we want visible.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You want it to be visible.
[1:23:08] But I'm saying here's what he says
[1:23:11] because so often we're looking for the
[1:23:14] seen
[1:23:16] but faith
[1:23:18] the trying of your what?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of things what?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And the evidence of things what?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Not seen.
[1:23:26] see God. But we want to see, don't we?
[1:23:30] Seeing is believing. If I can only see
[1:23:32] an angel, if I can only Amen. The
[1:23:35] prophet of God saw angels. And A and I
[1:23:38] heard different one said, I I saw an
[1:23:41] angel. I want to see one.
[1:23:44] And then I know I'm I'm on the right
[1:23:46] course. I want to know I'm I'm I'm on
[1:23:49] the right path. Let me see an angel.
[1:23:52] Thomas said, "Except I I won't believe
[1:23:54] except I can see."
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] I ain't going to believe it until I CAN
[1:24:00] PUT NOT ONLY DO I WANT TO SEE, I WANT TO
[1:24:02] PUT MY finger
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; into the nail prints and I want to I I
[1:24:06] want to touch THAT SIDE.
[1:24:09] I WANT TO KNOW FOR MYSELF. SEE, knowing
[1:24:14] seeing is believing. No.
[1:24:17] Amen. Believing.
[1:24:20] Amen. And you don't have to see.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Are you up there?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU TRUST A GOD?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let me see. Whom heaven what?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Ye.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Do you have to see him to love him?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; HAL OH GOD. HALLELUJAH. SOMETHING GOT TO
[1:24:45] HAPPEN IF
[1:24:47] you know you know I was talking to
[1:24:51] somebody and they'll show their face and
[1:24:54] you know I want to see him how they look
[1:24:57] and all and talk sweet
[1:25:01] and nice and she so sounds so sweet. I
[1:25:06] want to see her face.
[1:25:09] She want to see who I'm talking to.
[1:25:14] You know how these young people peeping,
[1:25:16] slipping,
[1:25:18] might be talking to somebody. Oh Lord, I
[1:25:22] done spent all my time talking to this.
[1:25:28] Know how to lure you in a You SPENT ALL
[1:25:32] YOUR TIME AND YOU SAY, "OH,
[1:25:36] I thought I was talking to a female.
[1:25:39] This is a big old
[1:25:48] Oh goodness. Suppose I have went out on
[1:25:51] a date.
[1:25:54] You see what I'm saying?
[1:25:57] You You were believing, but you didn't
[1:25:58] see, did you?
[1:26:10] But God won't disappoint you like that.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I said the Lord won't disappoint you
[1:26:17] like that.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He won't disappoint you.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get disappointed with these
[1:26:24] folks online and doing this and dating
[1:26:27] online and all that trying to find you
[1:26:29] somebody. I Amen. I'm so glad he found
[1:26:33] me.
[1:26:35] I ain't never been disappointed with
[1:26:36] him.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Never, LORD, I LOVE YOU.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I STILL LOVE HIM.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; And whom having not seen ye love?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. See, some sometimes people
[1:26:54] can't love God because they ain't they
[1:26:57] don't see God.
[1:26:59] But sometimes I you have to believe that
[1:27:02] Jesus died for your sins, shed his
[1:27:05] precious blood, that he he's forgiven
[1:27:09] you of all your sins, all your
[1:27:11] trespasses, and all you have to do is
[1:27:14] receive him as your personal savior.
[1:27:17] It's an individual thing. Are you with
[1:27:18] me?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And if you believe, you will see.
[1:27:24] Not if you see, you believe.
[1:27:27] He says, "And whom though now ye see him
[1:27:31] not." Amen.
[1:27:34] Yet what?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Yet believing you what?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the trouble is. People ain't
[1:27:43] rejoicing.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; All right. Why they ain't rejoicing?
[1:27:49] Cuz they don't believe.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; They come with their head down. They go
[1:27:53] back with their head down because they
[1:27:55] don't believe. But if you truly believe,
[1:27:59] you can what?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; You can rejoice. Not only did he leave
[1:28:05] it, he said, "Rejoice with what?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You You never been filled up with joy
[1:28:13] unspeakable." You never got to know the
[1:28:16] Lord, the love of God that it becomes
[1:28:19] unspeakable. that he you may speak in
[1:28:22] another language. You may speak in tong
[1:28:24] it may fill you up and your tears start
[1:28:27] rolling BECAUSE WHY IS JOY UNSPEAKABLE?
[1:28:30] LORD, THANK YOU.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A FEELING. I'M
[1:28:34] talking about a revelation striking your
[1:28:36] soul.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT the word becoming real
[1:28:39] TO YOU.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT GOD, AMEN, SAYING, "I
[1:28:43] LOVE YOU.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. I CARE ABOUT YOU.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; I KNOW YOUR SITUATION. I KNOW WHAT
[1:28:50] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. AND I'M SO HERE
[1:28:52] FOR YOU.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Joy unspeakable and full of what?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; FULL OF GLORY.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. WHY WE OUGHT TO BE praising
[1:29:06] the Lord. The devil have our minds
[1:29:08] wondering whether or not GOD CARE,
[1:29:11] WHETHER OR NOT HE LOVED ME. HE ALREADY
[1:29:13] PROVED THAT.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; I SAID HE ALREADY GOT ENOUGH FOR US. HE
[1:29:18] ALREADY SHOWED US HOW MUCH YOU CARE.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; I'm taking my patent back
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; for Minister Lee Get. He's done. If he
[1:29:29] ain't done enough,
[1:29:31] he already done enough. Praise God. I
[1:29:34] said he already done enough.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's already proven how much he
[1:29:39] cares.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to do nothing else.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He's already done enough.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:48] So, by the grace of God, I know we got
[1:29:51] to go on, but I I know you got to go
[1:29:53] home, but let me I maybe I won't read
[1:29:57] these scriptures, but let me talk to you
[1:29:59] for a minute.
[1:30:02] The trial of your faith is much more
[1:30:06] precious than gold, though it be tried
[1:30:09] with fire. I want to say by faith
[1:30:12] Abraham when he was tried,
[1:30:15] praise God, when he was tested, he was
[1:30:18] able to offer up Isaac,
[1:30:21] the son that was given to him.
[1:30:25] When he he received him as though he and
[1:30:29] Sarah was dead,
[1:30:33] he said to Isaac,
[1:30:35] "God,
[1:30:37] if I kill you, I know God is able to
[1:30:41] raise you up from the dead." Are you
[1:30:43] with me?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; So God tested him, but he had to go all
[1:30:48] the way and ra the knife before God
[1:30:52] said, "Wait a minute. WAIT A MINUTE.
[1:30:55] PRAISE GOD. I don't know how far you
[1:30:56] have to go,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; but if you hold to God's unchanging
[1:31:00] hand.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is Jehovah Gyra.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And he will provide.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He'll vi
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; if he have to. Amen. Praise God.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Materialize a lamb ON THE
[1:31:16] SIDE.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL WORK THINGS OUT FOR YOU.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL DO IT FOR YOU.
[1:31:23] PRAISE GOD. IF YOU have to bring your
[1:31:25] husband from the North Pole,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He'll work it out for you.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Say, I don't see nobody. He didn't say
[1:31:42] what.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; See, he said, believe.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; If you pray, BELIEVE
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; THAT MY GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE. YES.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I don't see nobody. Well, you're just
[1:31:57] looking
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; instead of believing.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; You're trying to see. He didn't say see.
[1:32:02] HE SAID BELIEVE.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; SAY GOD, YOU GOD.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; You gave mama a husband.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You gave sister so and so. Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT ME?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET, don't pass me by.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] Glory to God. Ain't God good?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Now you got the city bleed or you going
[1:32:26] to believe anyhow?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I got to get off of that. That's corner.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; But uh where
[1:32:39] now Abraham was tested and he was tried
[1:32:44] but he passed the test.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Are you passing the test?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you willing to please God?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He passed the test.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe I do this on my conclusion.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I skip over all the other things.
[1:33:07] How their faith was tried. Y'all know
[1:33:09] about Daniel's faith being tried. It may
[1:33:12] seem repetitious,
[1:33:14] but his faith was tried.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It was tested. He was sold to the lions,
[1:33:19] but he was tested. Isn't that right?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; But he passed the test.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego, they
[1:33:28] what?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; They passed the test.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Okay, look at somebody say, "Are you
[1:33:35] passing your test?"
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Are you passing your test?
[1:33:44] Or should we put a F up there? Flunk.
[1:33:47] Flock are incomplete.
[1:33:52] Incomplete.
[1:33:55] I don't know. I'm in the middle of it.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't know which way I'm
[1:34:01] going.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are you going to speak FAITH
[1:34:04] AND SAY I PASSED THE TEST?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm not going to wait till
[1:34:09] it's over. Amen. I'MMA PRAISE GOD NOW.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:15] DON'T WAIT TILL THE BATTLE IS OVER.
[1:34:17] SHOUT NOW.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I said I was going to do this last
[1:34:26] scripture, but
[1:34:28] I already said that was the last one,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; but let me just
[1:34:35] I'll quit. Save it to T I mean, no f
[1:34:41] Friday or whatever. as if I do all the
[1:34:44] preaching for a while. But by the grace
[1:34:46] of God, I thank God for you.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I keep going
[1:34:51] and my time I try to let y'all out cuz I
[1:34:54] don't know where some of y'all at.
[1:34:57] Some of y'all got to go at a certain
[1:35:00] time, but some of y'all don't mind
[1:35:03] staying all day and night.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't God good? Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:35:12] I don't want God to put a failing grade,
[1:35:18] that I wasn't able to go through my
[1:35:22] time, my test,
[1:35:24] that I didn't come out victorious,
[1:35:27] that I said, "God,
[1:35:31] you made a mistake." that test they're
[1:35:34] blown.
[1:35:37] You know, you see because I because they
[1:35:40] they stronger than me. You give them
[1:35:42] that and give me theirs.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; God know what he doing. Isn't that
[1:35:46] right?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us going to have
[1:35:49] our own trials and our own test.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It was predestinated before the
[1:35:55] foundation of the world what we would go
[1:35:57] through.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; And God already know your outcome.
[1:36:02] But you got to thank God. God, you're my
[1:36:04] outcome.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've already given me the
[1:36:08] victory.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And you got to claim it.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; I'm Oh, good. God bless you. Let us
[1:36:14] stand. Amen.
[1:36:22] Sometimes
[1:36:24] sometime people say, "Well, if you
[1:36:26] holling and screaming, I can't
[1:36:27] understand you. Will you slow down and

[1:43:33] appreciate the word this morning? Amen.
[1:43:35] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[1:43:37] Amen. Trial of your faith. Amen. Trying
[1:43:41] of your faith. You know, last night I
[1:43:44] was looking over at it was Matthew 8 and
[1:43:47] how that centurion I said he had to go
[1:43:51] all the way out of the way knowing that
[1:43:54] he was uh the captain of the people that
[1:43:57] he was going to and wasn't even uh
[1:44:00] called consider himself worthy to be in
[1:44:03] their presence. But I said he had to go
[1:44:05] all the way out of the way, right?
[1:44:07] Because no doubt I say faith cometh by
[1:44:10] hearing. No doubt he heard the miracles
[1:44:12] that Jesus was working and he got in
[1:44:15] desperation. I was preaching to myself
[1:44:17] last night. I says, "But he says, "You
[1:44:20] don't have to come to my house. Just
[1:44:22] speak the word only."
[1:44:24] And Jesus uh saying he he looked at
[1:44:28] those he says, "I ain't found no greater
[1:44:30] faith." I can see him looking at the
[1:44:32] centurion saying, "This is where I'm
[1:44:34] trying to get y'all at right here. The
[1:44:36] faith that he got, this is where I'm
[1:44:38] trying to get y'all to." But you know
[1:44:40] what he says? Go thy way and as thou has
[1:44:44] believed it'll be done. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:44:47] Jesus. He says speak. Go. Come on. You
[1:44:50] ain't got to go to my just go thy way.
[1:44:52] He said as you believe it'll be done
[1:44:54] just like you said. And I was rejoicing
[1:44:56] last night just looking over the
[1:44:58] scriptures and I said, "God, that's what
[1:45:00] it is. Come on. You got to believe." He
[1:45:02] says, "Why? Why you marveling?" He says,
[1:45:03] "Speak the word. It'll be as you say."
[1:45:06] Come on. But do you believe this
[1:45:08] morning? Hallelujah. How many appreciate
[1:45:10] the word this morning? His presence.
[1:45:14] God is good. Amen. I I really enjoyed
[1:45:17] the word. Amen. I was a little
[1:45:18] frustrated the other night.
[1:45:21] Wasn't able to make it to church, but I
[1:45:24] was looking at it online after service
[1:45:26] is over with. I was telling uh telling
[1:45:29] them I says, "Man, if somebody come
[1:45:31] behind you, they might be a drop off." I
[1:45:34] said, "You the Lord got you going." I
[1:45:37] says we we got to keep going up. Amen.
[1:45:40] Because we all enjoying the word of God.
[1:45:42] Amen. For the season. How many believe
[1:45:44] it's a word for the season? Amen. I
[1:45:47] thank God this morning. Now, you can't
[1:45:49] doubt now. When you leave out of here,
[1:45:52] don't doubt it. No negative. We all
[1:45:55] speaking positive, right? Come on. God
[1:45:57] is good. Amen. Let us bow our heads this
[1:45:59] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[1:46:02] you for your grace today, Lord. Thank
[1:46:05] you for your mercy, Lord. God, the word
[1:46:08] that was preached, oh God, I know that,
[1:46:11] Lord, your word is a seed and I know
[1:46:13] that it reached the heart. So God, I
[1:46:15] pray, Lord, this the morning, Lord,
[1:46:17] that, oh God, that the word had fallen
[1:46:20] on good ground. And Lord, let it bring
[1:46:23] forth, oh God. May there be an explosion
[1:46:26] of faith, oh God. People believing you
[1:46:29] at your word, oh God, and signs and
[1:46:32] wonders following them that believe.
[1:46:34] God, we thank you. Continue, Lord,
[1:46:36] blessing the ministry, Lord. Continue,
[1:46:38] oh God, strengthening your people. Go
[1:46:41] with us now. Bless us in a mighty way,
[1:46:43] Lord, as we depart this place, but never
[1:46:45] your presence. Go with us. In Jesus
[1:46:48] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
