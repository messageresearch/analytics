we thank god for you pressing your way we thank god for especially our sister betty and brother frank amen look like the doctors were saying amen different but thank god for them god is good amen the book of saint luke 2 7 through 20 i'll read the first verse you read the next and we'll read the 20 together god is good amen i couldn't but think of these holidays and what it means so many seem to be you know leaving us during this time but we thank god for those lives that live for god amen two and seven and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swallowing clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and lo the angel of the lord came up upon them and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were so afraid 10. for unto you is born this day in the city of david the savior which is christ the lord 12. and suddenly there was with the angel multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god in sand 14 and it came to pass as the angel angels were gone away from them unto heaven that the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord has made known unto us 16. and when they had seen it they made known abroad the sand which was told them concerning this child 18. but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart together then the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all things that they had heard and seen as it was told until then god bless the readers where you may be seated you know i was looking back over alexander hitzel to babylons and sometimes we have to go back through history that we might be mindful that christmas as we know it the world is taking on a perspective that it wasn't so from the beginning um but it was the 21st day of december which was the sun god birthday and uh it was then it was celebrated as a heathen holiday but we find out around uh the third century it was kind of spoken of when um the catholic church began to talk about it and it was incorporated into the christian church or whatever and around the 4th century and but it was the queen of heaven some some folk says ladies day and the queen of heaven they worshiped the queen of heaven and that was paganism so by the grace of god but you you know because the world of taking on the perspective of celebrating it as the birth of christ and uh doing good things i said it's always good to do nice things it doesn't matter what day it's your understanding it's what you understand because you know he said my people are destroyed because of lack of knowledge and i wouldn't want you to come to church not knowing the truth amen and when you know the truth amen then you understand what truth is and um even if you look at the christians you look at christ's mass and we know we don't do mass but the catholic church has a mass are you with me so by the grace of god there's so many other things but we don't want to get into that this morning but we just want to give you just a brief history that amen you know a lot of times people don't know what they're doing and they do it amen because of lack of knowledge so by the grace of god when you get into pagan worship but people say well is it it is a sin to give i said what day is it to send the girl is it sin to do good what day is it a sin to do good well some people this is their only opportunity to be nice and i'm saying if you give people the opportunity to be nice and give their little children or whatever then like thank god amen i i you know it was a lot of people in my family and you know it meant something to us to get a little something you know and i think a lot of children it means a little it means more to them grown-ups now no it's all right you know what i'm saying but by the grace of god we don't want to take things out of perspective and something that is imposed upon us that we have to do you know so and sometimes you put pressure on people like that got to do this and got to do that you know you don't have to do these things amen because if you want to do something that's all right i got nothing either way amen and so by the grace of god god is good anyway it's like one time i was telling sisters this morning somebody eat meat and somebody don't eat meat don't make a difference amen so by the grace of god that's as long as you're not imposing your doctrine and your teaching on me are you with me that's why we get in trouble we tell people this is what you got to do amen but if a person do something they want to do as out of the goodness of their heart this is up to them amen it's not imposed upon you and i think people are pressured into doing stuff they don't have no money don't can't even pay their bills and they go out there and they're trying to do christmas first of all first thing to first pay your light bill your water bill your rent and if you got something left thank god amen so by the grace of god i didn't mean to go that far into that but i need to emphasize that a little bit because sometimes especially sometimes we forget the very principles and when we forget that then somebody says i wish somebody would have told me but nobody said nothing nobody in church told me i wasn't talk so somebody outside you know they began to tell you about it and you think oh i didn't know that you know you know it amen god bless you so um luke here i want to talk about god's rap gift this morning you know god to rap gift another thing uh i i wanted to bring out uh for a moment here is in matthew 2 matthew 2 and 11. it's just some things are taken out of perspective people twist the scriptures and they do do the scriptures any kind of way and uh a lot a lot of times people do it and they think that this is the way the bible teaches but a lot of times they're doing things and the bible's not teaching it that way but uh because man has twisted the bible so much till people look at it and they take for granted that this is the truth 2-11 it says and when they were come it's talking about let's just look at the first verse and he says and now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod that came behold there came wise men out from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have what we have seen this star in the east and we'll come to worship him okay so here these wise men out of the east there was three of them amen they come to worship him and they was talking to harold where is he you know this king that was born king of the jews where is he you know so they enquired and they sent them to bethlehem okay he says here in the 11th verse she says and when they were come unto the house they saw the what not a baby wrapped in now you remember what we read in luke it was a baby but when the wise man came men came they saw what a young child not a baby but a young child and oftentimes you see the three wise men before the baby but the difference is in in uh luke you saw not the wise men we saw what the shepherds are you with me now it's a difference now because most people when you see the baby you see the wise men bringing gifts isn't that right so it's now this wasn't a baby this was a young child and you know pile i mean harrod wanted to kill all the children from what two years under now if there's a baby he just want to kill the babies but he wanted to kill from two years under so it took them from the east it took them months to get there once they saw the starter that the child was born amen so by the grace of god we'll go back over here to luke um two and by the grace of god and i says god should wrap gift amen y'all feel all right there ain't been lots of folk missing this morning but god is still good i'll still love you amen hallelujah god is doing a great work amen and i i'm so blessed to know what god is doing thank god for the children and the effort and wanting because i think it's set a beautiful stage for what we're ministering on and i thank god for him amen so by the grace of god god's a rap gift amen now you know on one occasion i think i was ministering in trinity died and i asked them to find me a rag and um and i was gonna put some money and different gifts into this rag and i said make sure it smelled bad and they knew some stuff that would make it smell terrible and they got it and i was teaching the young people and i was trying to give it well one of the young men he came forth and he wanted it and he looked in there he saw cds he saw this and see they didn't want it because it smelled so bad it didn't look see god's wrapped gift he was wrapped in swaddling clothes somebody said he was wrapped in rags to come off the ox back here the one that was king of kings lord of lords the god that created the heavens and the earth they meant come in a way that was so simple it meant that you know the way where he came with such humility and so such humbleness but amen that he they didn't want him amen not only did they not warn him if because amen uh why he came amen and how he came then is how he comes now are you with me uh uh wrapped in rags the greatest gift that with the world amen that god was given amen god had a way of wrapping a gift the way he wanted to wrap it amen but people don't want to receive it because what it was wrapped in you know they they look for a gift for they met with the uh angels coming in they're coming in on chariot amen and they they looked in their expectation of amen for the king the savior to come in a certain way their expectations were uh that that if he was to come and as great as he was amen could god kindly sin and come down in such a simple form and god comes that way amen out of the reasoning and understanding of man and what they expect and god comes in an unexpected way amen not the way the church were what could receive him amen amen they couldn't receive him that way amen that's why they made god's servants say why it had to be shepherds praise god you could send a king amen or you consent a queen or you can send great people amen to go into a stable amen and and see amen one that was born amen wrapped up in rags amen god's servant said he's wrapped in swallowing cold wrapped in rags they meant because he was wrapped in such a way that they did they didn't want him you can you see the king howard coming down amen in this kingdom rove and amen seeing this the the the king of kings uh uh could you see it meant the rich and they met the wealthy of that day coming uh and recognizing him as king no no god comes in such a humble way he comes in humility such a humble manner that god would come in praise god and i thank god that folks today amen amen they want a a gift amen they want a gift that will they want to maybe a a diamond ring maybe they want a uh uh uh uh a brand new uh uh bmw maybe a mercedes bend with the riven on it amen maybe they want a a new house for christmas amen it's not about christ it's about them maybe they want uh some beautiful something amen something in their imagination if you're going to give me something they may give me something that amen i can receive give me something that uh that i won't amen give me something that has some class to it amen can you see somebody giving you something amen that don't have any class to it amen i don't want that you know who you think you're giving that's true it ain't got no class to it but i'm giving you something [Music] amen praise god and god's greatest gift amen was rejected because what it was wrapped in amen wrapped in rags wrapped in swaddling clothes and amen he was despised and rejected to men amen they ain't him neither do the world want him he was put out of his own church they meant to put him on the outside praise god because they met praise god they were rich high-minded headed high-minded lovers of pledges more than lovers of god they meant they had too much pride about themselves we're living in the last the layout of civil age where people they meant to get so rich in increasing goods and they have needed nothing don't know that a wretched poor miserable blind and knock it and don't even know him brother sister amen god's rap gift he meant god wrecked they met the bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word took on flesh and dwelt among us oh you look man the word the bible said he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh amen praise god he didn't know no sin but he became sin amen because he took on amen humanity what division was in him he was god but they looked on the outside and he didn't look like a king he didn't look like what they thought he should look like so they didn't warn him brother sister that's why the world don't want they don't want him now because of what he looked like they met god's precious gift of the holy ghost and rejected praise god god's greatest gift is the baptism of the holy ghost the gift of god is eternal life but he's rejected amen because the people are heading high mining they'd rather have a rabbis they'd rather have creeds and dogmas and men but they don't want jesus hallelujah only the poor look at how he came amen pope people they meant they were so poor that they had to get some rags to wrap him in amen pope mary paul joseph i'm sure if they had enough money they meant they would have made room in the end but because they were pro-humble people didn't have much something somebody today amen when they think about christmas and they think about the reason for the season just look at where we've gone in our minds and in our hearts where we stand today the church is they meant where folks are spiritually they met they've come so they met uh an expectation of the worldly things they become so wildly minded they meant to uh when it comes down to godly things they can't recognize god because god is wrapped amen in an unexpected way god had wrapped up amen and folks won't they don't want the gift of god amen they don't want because god comes in he wraps it the way he wants the rabbit they met the bible said he wraps himself in acts 2 38. people don't want acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive what the what say it one more time know what god's a rap gift but they don't want it god's way because god wrapped it this way they don't want god's gift because it's wrapped in acts 2 38 so they don't want that brother says i'm so glad that amen god resisted the pride but giving grace to the what to the humble praise god the bible says humble yourself under the mighty hand of god that he might exalt you i'm so glad that somebody was humble enough praise god i was saying brother sister we got to get out of the spirit amen the spirit of the siege we got to get away from ourselves amen get away from our pride and think we got something to think with somebody when we're nothing we gotta humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god amen we gotta forget about what kind of house we live in what kind of car we drive and how much money we make we gotta humble ourselves and see what god wants praise god god wants some humble people amen remember forget about what kind of job and what kind of education what kind of standard praise god because you can miss god because you're looking for god amen out of the eyes of amen your intellect people want to serve god amen a classy god a god that would come out and amen i look at the way people worship god today it's a hollywood style worship the preacher looking like he's a flamboyant amen he's looking so cool and he's got to drive a certain thing live in a certain neighborhood he's got to be somebody a man of a promising in the city he's got a amen have a certain sophistication about himself amen but here amen god wants to humble amen somebody's not in all of that and not about all of that amen but it's about somebody receiving god's gift god gets wrapped up in rags wrapped in swallowing clothes only the hormone can receive oh yes brother sister if we can just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god god would exalt us but it's it it it's time to stop looking for a santa claus are you with me folks amen they'll receive santa claus but they won't receive jesus amen praise god no santa claus and folks ain't even got a chimney raised guard but yet they still tell a lie santa claus coming down the chimney too fast are you with me so folks will receive a lie rather than receiving the truth they making it all about uh uh uh a lie amen instead of receiving the truth folks are getting drunk in their party and they're doing all kind of stuff but they don't want jesus god rap gift amen that gives eternal life amen they don't want eternal life they don't want it because if they get it they want it to come their way amen they want a guard in the way they think he ought to be and the kind of god they want praise god that's why i didn't receive him the bible said he came into his own and his own received them not amen because amen they were expecting somebody different in their church they had been taught that he'll come according to the fiery seeds the way inside your seed way they won't cut he won't come according to the word [Music] but jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life for they are they that testify on me and you know you know i thank god that a little baby could be born and change the whole world are you isaiah 9 and 6. are you with me god is good amen brothers and sisters i hope you'll amen just change the way amen you think sometimes and it's difficult to let the word penetrate until it means something to you and i and that god will penetrate our hearts that we could see ourselves in the word and amen become humble and enough to lord i want to receive you amen come in your own way i'm not going to dictate to you i'm not going to tell you how i want it i want to cut amen your provided way amen you come you're providing way for this day amen not the way i want but what you want amen so i i lord not my will but let your will be done whatever you want to do in my life god i want to receive your way i want to receive your divine gift god whatever you want to do with me whatever you want me to receive god i'm willing to humble myself because i need you jesus i need oh god that power for you amen power amen the holy ghost power the gift of god hallelujah god wants you to receive power god wants you to give you that gift amen where the sick are healed amen the dead are raised even the blind see the crippled walk god wants to give you power amen but you gotta be humble it comes god provided way the way god want to sin it sometimes we can't get it we don't want to receive it god's way because we're already made in our imagination of our mind if god don't come to me he's going to have to come a certain way no god has to come his own provide a way the way he wants to do it the way he wants to go isaiah 9 and 6 it says unto us or what amen god that's god's way of coming amen the lord himself shall give you a sign amen a virgin shall be with the child are you with me who gonna believe that or that a virgin that no not a man they're gonna have a child that's god's way amen he's coming a scriptural way the way he said he'll come he's coming praise god it'll be a virgin in this hour that received the word for this hour amen praise god a wise virgin amen praise god god bless you for unto us a child is what and until i say what a son is given praise god i'm going to leave a few minutes to let larry come but thank god for him he said no unto us a son is given and the government shall be what amen what it means amen this is he coming in simplicity but he's revealing himself in his own word are you with me he coming in simplicity amen simple way of coming amen lord have mercy you know when it bought tears to my eyes just this morning as i was meditating i said god man i i i wanted to cry i i mean it i said lord look look what look where he came from look who he was brother and sister for me and you are you worth that that's the lord stink rags the savior the king of kings the lord of lords god that created the heavens and earth i said god are we really getting it i i said lord maybe i had to come back and say i i i was thanking the lord for god's servant how he bought this i said god lord you know sometimes i think we don't get the impact sometimes i i think it goes over our head the impact of it i don't want it it just i i just had to hold back the tears and i think sometimes to see how much he loved us and how much he cared for us and we sat around and though we deserved to be saved i mean like and we don't appreciate what he done for us and and i sat back and i said lord just if you relax president trump president biden mary queen and elizabeth to go into and to bow down and they said they worship him if you you would you expect they said the three wise men were three kings that come out of the east there wasn't so much as jews there were three kings that come out of the east and they seen this star and they come to worship him are you with me how many kings would come to worship him now how many great men of society some of some folk now of the great society they ain't coming they now come in acts 2 30 wait acts 2 38 way to receive the gift of god because it's not wrapped in matthew 28 19 supposedly supposedly he's not in he not three persons in the godhead but he's one person in three offices are you with me he's god above us god with us and god in us he's not coming the way they say but they and they fail to recognize so they don't get the power the power that comes to god's provided way the power that they expect in the church where people can live holy where they can they might pray to have power and dominion over sin amen they don't see the holy ghost moving they don't see signs and wonders they don't see the power of god they're not expecting that to happen because they did not come god's provided away all you would but you that are humble yourselves you that amen obey the word oh lord i don't know about you brother and sister i don't think i looked at this the way i'm looking at it now i don't know whether god has something to do with my age or something to do that god just said hey can't you see this if god can do all this for us if he can do all this for you and i and we sat around almost like i ain't gonna worship him if they can come miles and miles and took him months to get to him just to give him a gift just to honor him and respect him it took them months to get to him but they wanted to come they wanted to come where they could give him something amen and we come in our cars and our automobiles and we come to give him nothing but we ought to
