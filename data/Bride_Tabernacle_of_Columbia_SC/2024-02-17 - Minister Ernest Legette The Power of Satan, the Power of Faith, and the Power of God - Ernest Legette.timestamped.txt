[33:41] amen God is good amen we want to look at
[33:44] the book of Exodus by the grace of God
[33:47] Exodus
[33:55] 2
[34:09] Exodus 2 and one you got it say
[34:12] amen and it reads and there went a man
[34:17] of the house of Levi and took a wife
[34:20] took a took wife a daughter of Levi and
[34:23] the woman conceived and bear a son and
[34:25] when she saw him that he was good a
[34:27] goodly child she hid him three months
[34:31] you may be
[34:32] seated want to read a little further
[34:34] down she she hid him three months and
[34:38] when she could no longer hide him she
[34:40] took him for she took for him an ark in
[34:44] of bull rush bull rushes and doed it
[34:47] with slime and with pitch and put the
[34:49] child therein and she laid it in the
[34:52] flags by the Rivers's Brink and his
[34:55] sister stood a far off off to Wi what
[34:58] would be done to him and the daughter of
[35:00] pharaoh came came down to wash herself
[35:03] at the river and her maidens walked
[35:06] Along by the Riverside and when she saw
[35:08] the ark among the flags she sent her
[35:11] maid to fetch it and when she had opened
[35:14] it she saw the child and behold the Babe
[35:18] wept and she had compassion on him and
[35:21] said this is one of the Hebrews children
[35:24] then said his sister to Pharaoh's
[35:27] daughter shall I go and call thee a
[35:30] nurse to the Hebrew women of nurse of
[35:32] the Hebrew women that she may nursed the
[35:35] child for thee and Pharaoh's daughter
[35:36] said said to her go and the maid went
[35:40] and called the child's
[35:42] mother amen may God a blessed to the
[35:44] reading of his word this evening again
[35:47] tonight by the grace of God just for a
[35:50] moment I know we just going to start on
[35:52] this tonight and I wanted to I entitled
[35:55] it the power of of Satan the power of
[35:58] faith and the power of God Amen the
[36:01] power of Satan the power of faith and
[36:04] the power of God now we know that you
[36:07] know here in the scripture uh scripture
[36:09] reading and you know in Exodus and and
[36:11] what was here to take place in in the
[36:13] first Exodus we know the people were in
[36:16] bondage but God was getting ready to do
[36:18] something to get them out of that right
[36:20] because God had promised that he would
[36:23] bring them out so you know and it was
[36:26] time coming coming near the time for God
[36:29] to bring the people out of bondage so
[36:32] you know what happened here we saw three
[36:36] different we throughout the first Exodus
[36:38] you you'll see three different powers
[36:41] that's on display one is the power of
[36:43] Satan others power of faith and the
[36:44] power of God right but you know I says
[36:48] that even in we see that as it displayed
[36:52] in the first Exodus that's what's going
[36:53] got to be on it will be on display in
[36:56] this this last Exodus right you know I
[36:59] always say even though we saying the
[37:01] power of Satan Satan don't really have
[37:04] no power CU When Jesus rose he said all
[37:07] power is given unto me so when we saying
[37:10] the power of Satan is only what you you
[37:13] give him or you allow him to have over
[37:15] your life but outside of that he's
[37:17] powerless because Christ rose with all
[37:20] power you believe that tonight but we
[37:22] know that you know uh uh just in our
[37:25] scripture reading I says you know the
[37:28] devil one thing he does he always has a
[37:31] a way of trying to forerun what God is
[37:34] getting ready to do a lot of times he
[37:36] might not necessarily know what God is
[37:38] going to do but he know that something
[37:40] Supernatural or something major is about
[37:42] to take place so he always try to
[37:44] forerun it to do to try to either throw
[37:47] it off or or to try to stop it right but
[37:50] no matter how much the devil try or who
[37:54] he tries to use to throw off or to stop
[37:57] God from what he's doing is nothing he
[37:59] can do to stop what God want to do God
[38:02] is going to fulfill what he want to do
[38:04] and it's nothing that the devil can do
[38:06] about it right and that's why we thank I
[38:08] thank God because as we were uh
[38:10] preaching the last uh couple weeks on
[38:13] about how how uh great God is and and
[38:16] he's like he told them in Jeremiah you
[38:19] forsaken me the Fountain of Living
[38:20] Waters and how you know he can does he
[38:22] can do whatever he want he's he's not
[38:25] something you can contain how this great
[38:26] God is so you know just meditating on
[38:29] these things I says a lot of times the
[38:32] devil you know he'll use all kind of
[38:34] things he'll use sicknesses he'll use uh
[38:37] uh uh uh people out the job he'll use
[38:39] the political realm he'll use all kinds
[38:41] of things to stop uh uh to stop what God
[38:44] wants to do with you as an individual
[38:47] with the bride as a group but I says you
[38:50] know no matter what happens no matter
[38:52] what he does we're on the winning side
[38:55] we're on a one way trip y'all believe
[38:58] that tonight long as we stay in God's
[39:00] hand because God he can't fail but
[39:03] that's what it is so I I was looking at
[39:05] some things and I says you know I I
[39:06] begin to be stirred in my spirit I says
[39:09] you know what it what it was you know we
[39:12] find that I says you know in that day
[39:15] what did what did the devil do trying to
[39:17] use his power he tried to use pharaoh
[39:19] and some of the the the taskmasters and
[39:22] all of that day they want to kill all
[39:24] the men children throw them all in there
[39:26] in the in the river and all that all
[39:28] these things right to try to stop what
[39:30] God was was was getting ready to do but
[39:34] I like how the Bible says that you know
[39:36] they begin to afflict them and oppress
[39:38] them and make their lives bitter with
[39:40] hard bondage in the first chapter but it
[39:43] says the more that they afflict them the
[39:45] more they grew and the more they were
[39:48] blessed why because no matter what the
[39:51] if if if you're blessed by God as we
[39:54] keep saying when God blesses you you're
[39:57] blessed when the if God curse you you
[40:00] cursed too but if God blesses you you
[40:02] blessed the devil tries to put weights
[40:05] on your pressures all these things on
[40:07] your life but now if you give him that
[40:09] type of power over you you know and get
[40:12] in your mind and think that you you're
[40:14] not able CU of giants in the land and
[40:17] all these things then you'll be just
[40:19] like they said uh uh in in numbers you
[40:21] know they saying we in our own eyes were
[40:23] as grasshoppers in their sight in their
[40:26] own eyes but when you're not looking
[40:30] through your own eyes when you're
[40:31] looking at who's made the promise to you
[40:35] when you're looking at the what you got
[40:36] going on in your life you look at who
[40:40] who called you I didn't call myself not
[40:43] not just necessarily talking about the
[40:45] ministry but called you to be a Son of
[40:46] God I didn't call myself I like how you
[40:49] know the prophet God was talking about
[40:51] you know somebody made a statement once
[40:53] that you know the devil put us in the
[40:55] pwn shop out but God came and redeemed
[40:57] us
[40:58] out come on and that's and that just
[41:01] just sitting there meditating on it how
[41:03] the devil might have had somewhat claims
[41:07] on your life when you were born cuz you
[41:08] were born in bad shape and all those
[41:10] things but it's one thing about it the
[41:13] Redeemer has
[41:14] come and he had paid the price right so
[41:18] when he come it's the devil can't hold
[41:20] you the devil can't hold this all your
[41:23] life or do all these things because God
[41:25] has already paid price for it come on
[41:28] and you and he just coming back to get
[41:30] us he's coming back to redeem us he's
[41:34] already redeemed us but he's coming back
[41:36] like I says he's already he's already
[41:38] can't really get it off like I like I
[41:40] was it was in my spirit but he he's
[41:42] already redeemed us God is we like I
[41:46] said the power of God the power of faith
[41:48] I mean the power of Satan the power of
[41:50] God and the power of Faith the power of
[41:52] of Satan he's just trying to you know
[41:54] hold things over your grip You by fear
[41:56] the Bible talks about that that you know
[41:59] we don't have fear over in you know I
[42:03] wrote the scripture down but you know it
[42:05] says that and we we're not of those that
[42:08] you know have fear right over in nobody
[42:12] didn't just wrote it down but you know
[42:16] in 1 John 4:18 says you know let's let's
[42:19] turn around and let's look at that 1
[42:21] John
[42:23] 4:18 God is good amen trying to trying
[42:26] to just go a little slow because I know
[42:28] it's I got a lot I want to say but I
[42:29] can't I won't be able to say it all so I
[42:32] don't want to just jump all over
[42:36] myself but I'm just trying to trying to
[42:39] I guess get get get your mind to start
[42:43] thinking right CU God been doing
[42:44] something with me in my spirit it's just
[42:47] to have you start looking at everything
[42:49] different
[42:50] now because God is in control no matter
[42:53] what God is in control I was telling
[42:56] charl at the other day I saying you know
[42:58] I say and I said don't fret certain
[43:01] things don't fret that I said God got
[43:03] you God going to take care of it don't
[43:06] fret that don't fret that as I was
[43:07] telling brother Gordon that last week
[43:09] something don't fret fret not yourselves
[43:12] God is going to take care of you you
[43:15] blessed you
[43:17] know you you blessed from every wit
[43:19] because God has blessed you and if and
[43:22] if and if God is for you then who can be
[43:24] who going to be who can be against
[43:27] come on if he's on our side who's going
[43:28] to be against you when he says yes who
[43:31] can tell who can tell no who can say no
[43:34] come on who can stop you
[43:37] right we don't walk around like we it's
[43:40] because it ain't us we know it's God
[43:42] right we know it's God put you in
[43:45] certain places it's God that did certain
[43:47] things so you don't worry about trying
[43:50] to maintain this and that because God
[43:52] did
[43:53] it and everything God does is perfect
[43:56] am y'all believe that come on the Bible
[44:01] says he give and he take away but we
[44:02] going to still bless his name because
[44:05] even though he take away he he just
[44:07] making like he says the the tree
[44:09] sometime when they get purged it's just
[44:10] making making room for new fruit more
[44:13] right more to come I believe that y'all
[44:16] believe that tonight come on first
[44:19] John four by the grace of God four
[44:25] and is 18 you got it say Amen let's
[44:29] start the 17th verse he said herein is
[44:31] our love made perfect that we may have
[44:34] boldness in the day of judgment because
[44:37] as he is so are we in this world there
[44:40] is no fear in what love come on there is
[44:44] no fear and love y'all believe that and
[44:47] this is a strong topic to deal with but
[44:51] there is no fear and love right A lot of
[44:55] times people
[44:56] uh confess from their mouth got love
[44:59] love love but they veryy actions and 10
[45:01] minutes later they'll they very words
[45:04] right because your like like I believe
[45:06] it was told U Peter one of those they
[45:09] said are you a Galilean he said no and
[45:11] then somebody said your speech betraying
[45:12] you and and it does even here today
[45:15] right but that's why I said let the
[45:17] words of my mouth and the meditation of
[45:19] my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh
[45:22] Lord is that your prayer tonight come on
[45:26] what what's in my heart God let what's
[45:29] in my heart be right all the time what
[45:32] you look at me might not look right
[45:35] sometimes but let what's in my heart be
[45:37] right because that's what's going to
[45:39] project itself on the outside come on
[45:43] y'all believe it and and a lot of times
[45:46] people they they really really concerned
[45:48] about the outside but in their heart
[45:50] they know things ain't right they know
[45:52] they got uh stuff in their heart and
[45:54] they they try to cover that up but
[45:56] remember God sees that God sees what's
[46:00] on the in that's one thing about it to
[46:02] realize that you are naked and open
[46:05] before God come on the word of God is
[46:07] quick and is powerful sharper any twoed
[46:10] sword it it can divide between those
[46:13] things those things you think are hidden
[46:16] they're not hidden before God so Lord
[46:19] God blessing me what stop the well up oh
[46:23] but those hidden things God sees those
[46:25] things the things you think hidden
[46:27] they're not hidden they're disarmed
[46:29] they're naked before God God seeing them
[46:31] right so the the think about the being a
[46:34] who he is then that causes you to want
[46:36] to walk it God the Holy Ghost checks
[46:40] your thoughts it checks your your words
[46:44] stuff you say the Holy Ghost got to
[46:46] check you amen you didn't say that right
[46:50] come on something's got to be
[46:53] there it's got to be he says he I'm the
[46:57] Lord I w't share my glory with no other
[47:00] I was talking with a guy last night CU I
[47:02] had to go back out to the job last night
[47:04] one of my I called him he was my friend
[47:07] but he was the
[47:08] one first he at this then he didn't uh
[47:12] then he believed in God but not Jesus
[47:14] and then he was all mixed up and then he
[47:16] and he say he don't believe in God and
[47:18] all these things but last night I was
[47:21] testifying about the goodness of
[47:24] God and
[47:26] he don't even realize it till right now
[47:28] I might tell him when I see him again
[47:29] Monday but he started praising God right
[47:32] there with me and talking about how good
[47:35] God was and won't he do
[47:37] it he don't even I was thinking I said
[47:39] he don't even know he cuz I was talking
[47:42] about some situations in his life and
[47:45] all and how I I said man I told my wife
[47:48] don't worry about it God got you I said
[47:51] man when you doing right you walking
[47:53] doing the best you can for the Lord God
[47:55] going to take care of you I said people
[47:57] devise evil devices and all kind of
[47:59] things against you come on don't worry
[48:02] about it I won't I won't be afraid of
[48:04] the Arrows by day or the teros by night
[48:08] David knew what he was talking about
[48:09] didn't he cuz he had so many enemies I
[48:12] like the scriptures says that that you
[48:14] know even uh uh when I'm you know I'm a
[48:18] little tired
[48:19] tonight but says you know when your
[48:22] enemies all around you come on in the
[48:24] presence of my enemies that's it
[48:26] he anoints my head with what oil come on
[48:30] he can do it your friends and all that
[48:32] but when your enemies is there come on
[48:34] in the presence you don't have to be
[48:36] afraid God is there with you when you
[48:38] you say your enemies it's nothing but
[48:39] the devil anyway y'all believe it
[48:42] tonight but I says that that's what it
[48:44] is it's no it's no uh
[48:47] fear here in the 18th verse said there
[48:50] is no fear and love but perfect love
[48:53] cast out what fear because fear hath
[48:56] what come on the devil coming to torment
[48:59] you we said the power of of Satan the
[49:02] power of faith and the power of God you
[49:04] can't have faith when when you got when
[49:06] you don't have love they work together
[49:08] you can't have it right not not real
[49:11] Faith perfect Faith come on somebody
[49:14] said well you said well they can move
[49:15] all mountains and all these things and
[49:18] and have not love yeah you know well you
[49:21] become as a sounding brass and tinkling
[49:24] symbol right
[49:27] but I says the thing is is that you know
[49:30] uh uh uh perfect love cast out fear
[49:34] don't it perfect love can't because fear
[49:36] when fear come that's the power the
[49:38] power Satan is holding over your life is
[49:40] fear you afraid of what's going to
[49:42] happen tomorrow you're afraid of this
[49:43] you're afraid this going to happen
[49:44] you're afraid that going to happen fear
[49:46] right come on that's the power you're
[49:48] holding over your life but I said it's a
[49:50] power of Faith out there and what faith
[49:54] faith doesn't it does doesn't fear like
[49:56] that what what what faith says is even
[49:58] though the doctors gave me this
[50:02] report the Bible says that he was
[50:05] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[50:08] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[50:10] our peace was upon him and with his
[50:12] stripes we are
[50:14] healed that's the Bible that's that's it
[50:18] is it's no Adder taken away that's it
[50:20] that's what God Said right come on he
[50:23] didn't go that distance for you and I
[50:26] but but he can't he can't heal you he
[50:28] can't do what he want in your life if
[50:30] you don't have faith if you don't
[50:31] believe him right if you don't believe
[50:34] that God is able to do it he you'll sit
[50:36] right
[50:37] there you
[50:40] know but once once you you grab a hold
[50:44] of something happens to you Faith takes
[50:46] over and then like it says the power of
[50:50] Satan then but when the power of Faith
[50:52] Comes come on then Satan you know cuz
[50:57] then what it is the power of Faith
[50:58] brings on the power of God I believe
[51:01] that come on it bring the power when you
[51:05] begin to believe it right that's going
[51:07] to bring on the power of God come on the
[51:11] devil used his power to kill all the
[51:13] boys and try to do all that storm in the
[51:14] river but when Moses mother had him they
[51:17] and his father they saw he was a proper
[51:19] child right so something Faith took hold
[51:24] in that home had to it that she hit him
[51:27] and when she couldn't hide him no more
[51:28] what the power of Faith do come on weave
[51:32] a basket for him and put them right in
[51:34] the river with like they say all the
[51:35] alligators and crocodiles or whatever it
[51:37] was right Faith did that didn't it but
[51:42] it brought that power of Faith brought
[51:43] on the power of God didn't it cuz when
[51:46] did the power of God show up soon as she
[51:48] put him in the river come on not a not a
[51:51] crocodile or whatever was in the river
[51:53] could touch that basket could it because
[51:56] now the power of God is taking over I've
[51:58] released my faith and now it's up to God
[52:01] to do what he said he'll do come on
[52:03] that's where we at come on the power of
[52:06] the Devils all that wounding and trying
[52:09] to scare you and all those things come
[52:11] on but I'm releasing my
[52:13] faith come on and I'm letting the power
[52:16] of God take
[52:17] over I know the guy one of the guys at
[52:21] work was telling me that he was saying
[52:23] that a friend of his had um he went to
[52:26] the doctor and he was just retired was
[52:29] all happy to be retired and he went to
[52:31] the doctor and this is some years ago
[52:32] now and the doctor told him I think he
[52:36] might have just went for a checkup or
[52:37] something and then they saw something
[52:38] and they said come back then they told
[52:40] him you got stage for
[52:42] cancer and his friend he said cried like
[52:44] a baby in the doctor's office went home
[52:48] and cried you know he died a couple of
[52:49] months after that but I says you know I
[52:54] felt kind of bad s to hear it but I said
[52:57] but we we're not as those that don't
[52:59] have
[53:00] hope come
[53:02] on fear fear fear got a way of of
[53:06] causing stuff
[53:08] prematurely y'all believe it fear got a
[53:11] away of of making situations way worse
[53:13] than what they
[53:14] are come on fear got a way of dragging
[53:17] you all the way down don't it but we are
[53:21] not we're not like that come on I fear
[53:24] can't torment you say I can't let fear
[53:26] torment me come on but I'm going to
[53:29] believe
[53:31] God come on don't he slay me yet I'll
[53:34] trust him if that same spirit that
[53:37] raised Christ from the dead if it dwell
[53:39] in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies
[53:42] oh death where is thy sting oh grave
[53:44] where is thy Victory the word just start
[53:47] flowing out of you and then you say I'm
[53:50] going to release my faith cuz I'm not
[53:52] worried about death I'm not worried
[53:54] about sickness God already conquered all
[53:56] those things all of that was in
[53:58] Redemption y'all believe it come on
[54:01] healing was in was when when he died
[54:04] when he gave us life for you and I blood
[54:06] was shed you know when he redeemed us
[54:08] healing was a part of that come on
[54:11] healing was a part of that all those
[54:12] stripes and all healing was a part of
[54:14] that come on now you are you going to
[54:16] let the power of the devil hold you from
[54:18] keep getting what belongs to you what
[54:21] you're entitled to come on and the thing
[54:24] of is I can't do it on my own but what
[54:28] what what was what was Israel doing when
[54:30] they begin sing and crying by the reason
[54:32] of bondage they were crying unto God to
[54:35] keep a promise that he made their
[54:37] forefathers that one day you would visit
[54:40] us and they was crying and sign by the
[54:42] reason of bondage because now the time
[54:44] had come for deliverance right and God
[54:48] we're crying unto you because you
[54:50] promised us this is what you promised us
[54:54] and God God is faithful to keep his
[54:56] promise ain't it come on you look in the
[54:58] word and see all the Redemptive
[55:00] blessings that God has blessed you what
[55:02] are you fearing tonight what are you oh
[55:04] come on cry unto God sometimes I was
[55:08] sharing with somebody the other
[55:10] day I says to them I says you got to get
[55:14] victory over that
[55:16] situation I says what I said I I I dealt
[55:19] with that and I had to stay on my knees
[55:23] long enough to until I found peace with
[55:26] God and when you get up if you ain't got
[55:29] that that assurance that peace you need
[55:31] to get back down a little longer I was
[55:34] telling them and pray till you till you
[55:36] at peace with God on that situation cuz
[55:39] other than that the devil going to
[55:41] torment you you worried about the devil
[55:43] going to torment you saying oh you
[55:45] didn't do this right this right I says
[55:47] but once you've got down on your knees
[55:49] and you wrestled come on and you you you
[55:53] God the Holy Ghost comes and gives you
[55:55] you that Assurance gives you that rest
[55:57] and that peace when you get up I says
[56:00] then you don't deal with that situation
[56:02] no more because you put it in God's hand
[56:04] and God already took care of it you just
[56:06] walking you going on to the next trial
[56:08] to the next battle or whatever it is or
[56:10] walking in Victory because you put it
[56:13] over to God but one of the things I I
[56:15] saying to them you got to stay on your
[56:17] knees long enough come on we praying
[56:21] then stop praying and stop cuz cuz God
[56:25] some some situations I don't know about
[56:27] you but I had to come out to the church
[56:29] or get up in the middle of the night and
[56:31] just start praying I said Lord I'm going
[56:32] to pray I'm going to I'm going
[56:34] consecrate I'm just you just get down in
[56:36] there cuz you say Lord I need a word I
[56:38] don't want to carry this no more I'm
[56:40] ready to defeat this devil
[56:42] today and I don't want to deal with him
[56:44] tomorrow tonight I'm ready to feed him
[56:47] so what you do the greatest thing you
[56:49] can do get down your knees and pray tell
[56:52] God God I need your help Lord you said
[56:54] you move these mountains you told me to
[56:57] speak to them now I'm speaking Mountain
[56:59] get out of my
[57:00] way come on where there's depression
[57:03] sickness must said you don't know what
[57:05] I've been through one thing about it God
[57:08] knows every one of our
[57:12] situations stuff you ain't told nobody
[57:15] that you dealing with God know it don't
[57:18] you realize that God each and every one
[57:22] of us have things we're dealing with
[57:25] and and man probably don't never
[57:27] understand what you're going through you
[57:29] they may have a little compassion on you
[57:31] but to really understand what you're
[57:33] going through sometimes nobody will ever
[57:36] be able to understand it but what you
[57:38] got to realize is that Jesus you know
[57:42] God is he's touched come on the God that
[57:45] was above us came down and got in the
[57:48] body right that he could be God with us
[57:50] but he went back up and now he's God in
[57:52] us right in the form of the Holy Ghost
[57:54] ghost he's the same God but all those
[57:57] different manifestations that he he
[57:59] played his role in but it's no longer
[58:02] that he's God above you but he knows
[58:04] what you're going through he's he can be
[58:07] touched by what the feelings of your
[58:08] infirmities he knows what it's like to
[58:11] be rejected he knows what it's like to
[58:14] be be cast out he knows what it's like
[58:18] come
[58:19] on I said tonight God knows every one of
[58:22] our
[58:23] situations come on
[58:27] your situation God know your situation
[58:30] God know what you from The Young to the

[58:54] on come
[58:56] on God I don't know I said God I believe
[58:58] you God know God not only does he know
[59:01] our all of our
[59:03] situations but he knows what's up ahead
[59:06] he knows what's around the corner y'all
[59:08] believe it come on you know the other
[59:11] day I was tell us testimony I dreamed
[59:14] about a week or two ago that I got in a
[59:17] wreck and and I Dreamed A Car swerve and
[59:20] hit me out there on the interstate and
[59:23] uh you know it I started like to spin
[59:26] but then I woke up cuz you know I those
[59:28] dreams are I I don't know how it turned
[59:30] out cuz I jumped up out the bed like
[59:33] thank the Lord it was just a
[59:34] dream and
[59:36] uh
[59:38] but last week one day last week I think
[59:41] it was one day last week well week
[59:43] before I had a dream but I was coming
[59:44] home from from work right here on
[59:46] Interstate 20 and right there where they
[59:48] working on the road is getting tight
[59:49] before you get to bride River Bridge
[59:52] everything is getting tight and I'm on
[59:53] the the inside Lane so and it was a big
[59:56] you know 18 wheeler there rush hour
[59:58] traffic everybody moving I said you know
[1:00:00] I'm a you know you don't like to ride by
[1:00:02] those R beside those 18 wheelers you
[1:00:04] either want to be behind them or get on
[1:00:06] past them so I said I'm I'm I'm going
[1:00:09] shoot past this 18 wheeler and get out
[1:00:11] of his way but as I I hit the
[1:00:13] accelerator to go I heard something say
[1:00:15] to me uh be weary of the dream you
[1:00:19] had and I still started to go on past
[1:00:22] that truck but I said I'm I'm going take
[1:00:25] heed and no soon as I just I'mma back
[1:00:27] off you know that truck swerved over in
[1:00:29] my
[1:00:30] Lane I begin praising God in the car I
[1:00:33] said because the thing is God's got a
[1:00:36] way of warning us don't he a ain't you
[1:00:39] glad that he still shows you things to
[1:00:41] come come
[1:00:44] on
[1:00:45] now what you do are you going to take
[1:00:48] heed God still in he's still in that
[1:00:50] business come on say that's coincidence
[1:00:53] I don't not so
[1:00:55] come on I'm giving God all the
[1:00:57] glory cuz he even even at that time
[1:00:59] brought it to me and spoke to me about
[1:01:02] it right there in the car that's why we
[1:01:04] got to be keen on hearing God's voice
[1:01:07] it's a lot of voices out there but when
[1:01:10] when you get Keen to the voice of God
[1:01:14] you know it's him right it's it's
[1:01:17] unction from the Holy One and I said God
[1:01:20] that's what we need more than anything
[1:01:22] right but God still shows you things
[1:01:25] before it happens cuz why he's the same
[1:01:28] yesterday today and forever he didn't
[1:01:30] lose not none of his power as the years
[1:01:33] go on and the people have lost faith in
[1:01:35] the church today didn't they come on
[1:01:38] your faith should have always been in
[1:01:39] the word but the people have lost faith
[1:01:42] why because the the church today ain't
[1:01:45] no different from the world same stuff
[1:01:48] they just got religious spirits on
[1:01:51] them but you and I as as as Believers we
[1:01:55] want more than just
[1:01:57] church come on we need more than just
[1:02:00] church we need a God that's living a a a
[1:02:04] a God uh that's real come
[1:02:07] on because a paint and Fire won't do you
[1:02:09] no good when it's cold
[1:02:11] outside come on but you'll need the real
[1:02:14] thing right and he wants to give it to
[1:02:16] you remember God knows every one of our
[1:02:19] situations y'all I know y'all believe it
[1:02:23] come on but I
[1:02:25] say I want to read one more script I'm
[1:02:27] going to close I say it's too long
[1:02:29] anyway one more scripture here in um
[1:02:31] Mark 11 by the grace of
[1:02:34] God just wanted to that's you know stuff
[1:02:38] just started coming from
[1:02:41] everywhere Mark 11 but I say you know
[1:02:44] the power the power of Satan the power
[1:02:47] of faith and the power of God come on
[1:02:51] Satan try to hold things over you don't
[1:02:53] him fear and all but when When Faith
[1:02:57] Comes come on it brings about when it's
[1:03:00] real Faith it'll bring on the power of
[1:03:03] God come on and that's where we that's
[1:03:05] where we're coming to right now y'all
[1:03:07] believe
[1:03:08] it come on just like just like the devil
[1:03:11] used the Pharaoh knows and in Jesus uh
[1:03:15] day he used the Roman uh princes and all
[1:03:18] whatever the governors and all he used
[1:03:21] the you know the prophet of God is
[1:03:22] talking about the political realm he
[1:03:23] used all those
[1:03:24] to do what to try to stop what God was
[1:03:27] getting ready to do on
[1:03:28] Earth you know the Bible says that they
[1:03:30] was afraid and and and I was Herod and
[1:03:33] all those troubled all is and all the
[1:03:35] Jerusalem with him because you know they
[1:03:37] see those those men come and and they
[1:03:40] they coming looking for Jesus because
[1:03:42] they saw it starting and they coming to
[1:03:44] worship him right the King of Kings is
[1:03:47] about to be born God is doing something
[1:03:49] great in Earth but the devil knew it too
[1:03:51] he just didn't know what at some point
[1:03:53] right but what he always try to forun
[1:03:57] you know and then even in that day he
[1:03:58] used the he used those in that day to
[1:04:01] kill all the men from two years old and
[1:04:04] down all that but no matter how much he
[1:04:05] try to stop what God is doing he can't
[1:04:08] stop it God going to bring it to pass
[1:04:10] ain't it come on the devil triy to stop
[1:04:14] you know he said I have a bride without
[1:04:16] spot a
[1:04:17] wrinkle the world going on and on and on
[1:04:20] and going on it looks like like he said
[1:04:22] if time wouldn't be cut short no flesh
[1:04:24] should be saved but even in the midst of
[1:04:27] that he said for my leg sake right God
[1:04:30] will have himself a bride without spart
[1:04:32] or what
[1:04:35] wrinkle I believe
[1:04:37] it sometimes you might say well you know
[1:04:40] God it's all right I'm doing better than
[1:04:42] a lot of the other people that ain't
[1:04:44] good
[1:04:45] enough they that measure themselves by
[1:04:48] themselves as not what
[1:04:50] wise we got to Mark the perfect man
[1:04:52] which is what Christ
[1:04:57] Hallelujah Mark
[1:04:59] 11 by the grace of God Mark 11 and and
[1:05:03] 20
[1:05:06] 25 24
[1:05:08] 24 he says therefore I say unto you what
[1:05:11] things so soever you desire When you
[1:05:15] pray believe that ye receive them and ye
[1:05:18] shall what have them now that's what
[1:05:21] Jesus said ain't it
[1:05:25] he said whatsoever things you desire
[1:05:27] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:05:30] them what's the use of praying if you
[1:05:31] don't believe that it's
[1:05:33] coming what's you
[1:05:36] praying your your your your family
[1:05:38] members your children and all these
[1:05:40] other things and then you get up and
[1:05:41] then they unel cuz the devil going to
[1:05:43] meet you as soon as you get up and they
[1:05:45] getting worse this happened this
[1:05:47] happened oh come on well Jesus said
[1:05:50] Jesus said this didn't
[1:05:52] he he said what whatever right so I said
[1:05:55] well they got to they got to get it for
[1:05:56] themselves but you can pray for them
[1:05:59] come on don't let the devil use the
[1:06:02] intellectual they got to you got to pray
[1:06:04] for them pull down strongholds come on I
[1:06:07] don't know I've been praying for my
[1:06:08] family lately my whole entire family God
[1:06:13] help them you
[1:06:15] know I said I said the thing is and I'll
[1:06:18] say it again people got struggles that
[1:06:21] you don't know about people are battle
[1:06:24] and a battle and they got things that
[1:06:26] happened to them you don't know
[1:06:28] about and it and they got wounds the
[1:06:31] Bible says a wounded spirit is hard to
[1:06:34] bear come on hard to heal or bear wounds
[1:06:38] people got wounds they got things that
[1:06:40] they ain't tell nobody about but like I
[1:06:41] said God knows all about your
[1:06:44] situation and he's here to heal all
[1:06:46] wounds but you got to let him
[1:06:50] right
[1:06:51] Hallelujah but it says here
[1:06:55] and and when you stand praying do
[1:06:59] what
[1:07:01] forgive that was a big one you know I
[1:07:03] meditated on this today for a long time
[1:07:06] and the other day he says when you stand
[1:07:10] praying
[1:07:12] forgive he says if ye art if you have
[1:07:16] art against any that your father also in
[1:07:20] heaven I mean also which is in heaven
[1:07:24] May forgive you of your trespasses but
[1:07:27] if you do not forgive neither will your
[1:07:30] father which is in heaven do what
[1:07:33] forgive your
[1:07:35] trespasses come on sometimes say I
[1:07:37] forgave them but I ain't dealing with
[1:07:39] them no more it's your speech betray you
[1:07:43] something in your spirit ain't right

[1:08:04] there and no matter where you go if you
[1:08:07] elect the seed of God and God got to get
[1:08:10] you there he going to keep poking at
[1:08:12] areas until you get it right come on I
[1:08:16] seen I read something here in the in the
[1:08:18] um in the Amplified version on this same
[1:08:21] scripture he's saying for this reason
[1:08:23] I'm telling you whatsoever things you
[1:08:25] ask in prayer in accordance with God's
[1:08:27] will believe with confident trust that
[1:08:31] you have you have received them and they
[1:08:34] will be given to you he says whenever
[1:08:36] you stand praying if you have anything
[1:08:40] against anyone forgive them drop the
[1:08:43] issue let it
[1:08:45] go come
[1:08:47] on it's just the Amplified version
[1:08:49] sometimes like to read it he said drop
[1:08:51] the issue right you you have anything he
[1:08:54] said drop issue uh let it go so that
[1:08:58] your father who is in heaven will also
[1:09:00] forgive you your transgressions and
[1:09:02] wrongdoings against him and
[1:09:06] others come
[1:09:08] on not only against others but he said
[1:09:11] against him
[1:09:13] too against him and others but if you do
[1:09:16] not forgive neither will your father in
[1:09:18] Heaven forgive you your transgressions
[1:09:20] and we saying how how and and I was
[1:09:23] saying you know prayer I been listening

[1:09:33] have you can't make it without praying
[1:09:36] come on you can't get no ground covered
[1:09:39] without
[1:09:39] praying that's the weapon that God gives
[1:09:42] us to communicate even Jesus he went
[1:09:45] often to pray didn't he so that's one of
[1:09:49] that's one of the key things in your
[1:09:51] Christian
[1:09:52] Journey but that's the most fult hard
[1:09:55] thing fault ain't it but I'm saying even
[1:09:58] with
[1:09:59] that even if it's easy for you to pray
[1:10:03] right if you got something in your heart
[1:10:07] it don't do no good if you can't
[1:10:10] forgive if you if you got you know and
