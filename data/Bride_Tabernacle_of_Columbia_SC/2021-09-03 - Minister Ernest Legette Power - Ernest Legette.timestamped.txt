[1:08:06] then the 11 then the 11 disciples went
[1:08:08] away into galilee into a mountain where
[1:08:11] jesus had appointed them and when they
[1:08:13] saw him they worshiped him
[1:08:17] and jesus came and spake unto them
[1:08:20] saying all power is given unto me
[1:08:24] in heaven and in earth
[1:08:27] our power tonight
[1:08:29] is given unto me into heaven and earth
[1:08:32] go ye therefore and teach all nations

[1:08:59] topic that the lord put on my heart and
[1:09:00] i ministered about a week ago

[1:09:09] how jesus when they saw him he said all
[1:09:12] power is given unto me come on he didn't
[1:09:15] say some power did he but he said all
[1:09:18] power is given unto me and if all power
[1:09:21] is given unto him then how much does
[1:09:23] that leave the devil tonight
[1:09:25] that that leaves him what powerless
[1:09:28] many times we fearful and afraid but

[1:09:50] when they saw him the 11th saw him the
[1:09:53] bible said and some doubt it come on

[1:10:04] more hallelujah can he do
[1:10:07] you know sometimes no matter what god
[1:10:09] does people are doubting come on they
[1:10:12] saw him walk on water they saw him raise
[1:10:15] the dead hallelujah they saw him heal
[1:10:17] the hallelujah and he told them
[1:10:20] that in three days i'll rise again but
[1:10:22] yet when they saw some doubted

[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:19] the reason why
[1:44:21] things are not happening
[1:44:23] is because the people are failing to
[1:44:26] recognize where god is
[1:44:29] amen because they fail to recognize
[1:44:32] where god is
[1:44:33] they amen talk about a god
[1:44:36] they made it though he's a something
[1:44:39] but he's a very person
[1:44:41] amen he's a person
[1:44:43] he's jesus christ
[1:44:45] and that same jesus amen we don't look
[1:44:49] for him in heaven
[1:44:51] for the kingdom of heaven coming not
[1:44:54] would meet and drink
[1:44:55] but his righteousness peace and joy
[1:44:58] in the holy ghost
[1:45:00] amen because
[1:45:03] god
[1:45:04] all that god was
[1:45:06] he poured it into christ
[1:45:08] and all that christ was he put it in the
[1:45:11] bride
[1:45:12] he put it in his church
[1:45:14] so where's god now

[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:25] is in you
[1:45:28] if he's in you
[1:45:31] praise god then read me
[1:45:33] what if i'm looking at the book and i'm
[1:45:36] reading do i see jesus
[1:45:40] am i looking at jesus
[1:45:43] what am i reading
[1:45:47] i said read me
[1:45:50] praise god we got to read the book
[1:45:53] praise god our lives
[1:45:55] amen
[1:45:57] ought to be what the book said the bribe
[1:46:00] would be
[1:46:01] amen in this hour amen
[1:46:04] jesus said such a scripture
[1:46:06] for in them you think
[1:46:09] you have eternal life but they are there
[1:46:11] to testify for me
[1:46:13] praise god i wonder what was amen the
[1:46:16] structures that testified of you can you
[1:46:18] say
[1:46:19] like john the baptist the voice of one
[1:46:22] crime and oneness

[1:46:40] god has been unveiled
[1:46:43] amen he's not here
[1:46:46] praise god
[1:46:48] the world can't recognize it
[1:46:50] but you and i we recognize who god is
[1:46:53] and where god is
[1:46:55] praise god
[1:46:57] you know
[1:46:58] reason why folks
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:01] you can claim to have something

[1:47:05] reading you
[1:47:07] when we really read you
[1:47:09] we can be a part
[1:47:12] and we can be talking about something
[1:47:15] and we can be saying i'm identifying
[1:47:18] with it
[1:47:19] but when i read you
[1:47:22] that's not
[1:47:23] that's not what the book said the bribe
[1:47:25] would be
[1:47:27] praise god read me
[1:47:29] i'm reading
[1:47:31] and i'm looking at the tree and i'm
[1:47:33] seeing what kind of fruit is producing

[1:48:15] when we first started amen coming into
[1:48:19] columbia in the different areas
[1:48:21] throughout south carolina everybody
[1:48:23] would leave me to last
[1:48:26] and every preacher would just hand me
[1:48:27] the mic
[1:48:29] praise god
[1:48:30] and they said well brother simmers got
[1:48:32] it
[1:48:33] let's bring it home amen
[1:48:36] praise god
[1:48:37] it was all right for a season
[1:48:40] but brother and sister now i i think
[1:48:42] we've come to a place where we put our
[1:48:44] brakes on
[1:48:46] praise god we've learned terminology
[1:48:49] we learned how to act like the other
[1:48:51] folks act
[1:48:53] praise god but before the holy ghost was
[1:48:55] acting out
[1:48:57] now we're looking for a sign or our name
[1:49:02] amen you know you got to call amen
[1:49:06] approximate
[1:49:08] praise god if we say uh uh
[1:49:11] john the baptist it don't mean nothing
[1:49:13] and we said paul it don't mean nothing
[1:49:15] and we say uh
[1:49:17] amen anderson it don't mean nothing if
[1:49:20] we say amen oh lord but if we say
[1:49:24] sandwich that don't mean nothing
[1:49:26] but and we said william branham
[1:49:31] it means everything but you got to
[1:49:33] recognize
[1:49:34] amen where is god now
[1:49:38] amen you got to recognize god
[1:49:41] amen should be
[1:49:45] god shall be that same jesus
[1:49:48] he's so much alive as he was
[1:49:52] praise god yesterday
[1:49:55] he must be the living god today
[1:49:58] doing the same signs and oneness the
[1:50:02] same god doing the same thing
[1:50:04] in your life
[1:50:06] but if he's not
[1:50:08] it's all right to be a frog and look
[1:50:10] back

[1:50:13] praise god
[1:50:15] the frog look back to the past

[1:54:09] more
[1:54:11] because i want you to wake up because
[1:54:13] you know
[1:54:15] how the pharisees they thought oh
[1:54:18] certainly
[1:54:21] if he had known who that woman was
[1:54:24] that woman was
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:27] washing his feet

[1:54:43] you know what we
[1:54:44] are we looking for jesus
[1:54:47] are we really looking for jesus
[1:54:49] because the pharisees thought they were
[1:54:51] looking for the messiah but they had
[1:54:54] already been preached a messiah
[1:54:56] amen and that messiah was going to come
[1:54:59] according to their persuasion the way
[1:55:01] they thought
[1:55:02] but jesus always come
[1:55:06] amen in a way that the people are not
[1:55:08] looking for him
[1:55:11] are you with me
[1:55:12] jesus the creep right in once you've
[1:55:14] already formulated and already got it
[1:55:17] all mapped out how he did come if he
[1:55:20] comes surely he'll come to chaophas and
[1:55:23] he said chiamas i have arrived
[1:55:26] the high priest you know
[1:55:28] oh he'll come to the bishop but he'll
[1:55:30] come to this one
[1:55:31] brother and sister if god might come to
[1:55:34] one of these little young men on the
[1:55:36] front
[1:55:37] and god can you start using them
[1:55:39] but who want to listen to them
[1:55:42] who won't listen
[1:55:43] the holy ghost is no more in control
[1:55:46] we've already already put god and
[1:55:49] somebody said we'll put him in a box
[1:55:51] we've already formulated that the holy
[1:55:53] ghost holy ghost can't move no more
[1:55:56] why because amen
[1:55:58] it only can move with certain scenes
[1:56:02] you know when

[1:56:06] can say two words and i said that's a
[1:56:09] this particular nomination
