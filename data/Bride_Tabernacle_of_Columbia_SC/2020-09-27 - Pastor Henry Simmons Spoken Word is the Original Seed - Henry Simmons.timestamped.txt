[28:33] god bless you hebrews 11
[28:39] and one amen
[28:42] familia thought this morning
[28:46] i just want to encourage your heart
[28:52] i want you to think about it this
[28:54] morning and spoken word is original seed
[28:57] but i want you to think about
[29:02] your word body
[29:05] your word body god got a word
[29:09] body for you
[29:12] it was prepared before the foundation of
[29:15] the world
[29:17] amen because you were there before the
[29:21] foundation of the world before the
[29:23] what the world god had you in his mind
[29:28] here hebrews 11
[29:32] says and now faith is the substance of
[29:36] things hoped for
[29:39] the evidence of things not seen
[29:43] for by it the elders attain a good
[29:46] report
[29:47] through faith we understand it's the
[29:50] only way we can understand god through
[29:52] faith we
[29:54] understand that the world were framed by
[29:57] the word of god
[29:59] so that the things which are seen were
[30:01] not made by the things which do appear
[30:04] may god bless you reader's word you may
[30:06] be seated
[30:10] the spoken word is the original seed
[30:16] genesis 1
[30:20] 1.
[30:22] see how we got here amen
[30:26] it was what was in god's mind god
[30:30] wanted to express his thoughts amen
[30:33] and god expressed what he was thinking
[30:35] by his
[30:36] speaking the word
[30:40] and when god spoke the word the word
[30:43] began to materialize
[30:47] when god said let it be than it was
[30:52] amen in the beginning
[30:55] what god created the heavenly earth
[30:59] amen you and i are a product
[31:04] your your word body you are a part of
[31:08] the new
[31:08] creation
[31:14] we understand that the devil has
[31:17] perverted
[31:21] and he has tried to make a better eaten
[31:25] than god made a better world than god
[31:28] made
[31:30] but his world
[31:33] his eating is satan eating and what he
[31:36] is
[31:36] uh deformed
[31:41] it caused death so
[31:46] the he has perverted god's word
[31:51] a perversion of god's word god said you
[31:54] cannot add
[31:55] or take away from it
[31:58] because it's the original seed
[32:03] that's where the life is
[32:07] and now taken away from it brings
[32:10] death are you with me
[32:15] so many have added to the word or have
[32:18] taken away from the word it caused death
[32:23] many tried to interpret the message of
[32:25] the hour many try to
[32:27] interpret the word but god is his own
[32:30] interpreter
[32:32] god interprets his word by fulfilling it
[32:35] the intellectual mind want to amen come
[32:38] up with uh
[32:39] uh uh his own intelligence that he knows
[32:43] all things but god says uh when he gives
[32:46] you the holy ghost the holy ghost knows
[32:49] all things
[32:50] he shall teach you all things and god
[32:53] has given us a urine
[32:55] god has given us an absolute and that
[32:58] brings us back to the word
[32:59] god will not disagree with his word
[33:07] so folks come up with new revelations
[33:10] and
[33:10] new interpretations but god fulfills his
[33:13] own word
[33:15] when god said amen
[33:19] that a virgin shall concede amen
[33:22] god interpret his word by fulfilling his
[33:25] word
[33:27] so you will amen as you anticipate
[33:32] your word body
[33:37] we want to look at what shall be
[33:41] and what was but we got to recognize
[33:45] what is
[33:48] amen and if you recognize what is
[33:53] then it does not yet appear what shall
[33:56] be
[33:59] but you got to recognize what he is now
[34:04] he said but you are now the sons of god
[34:08] are you with me and it does not yet
[34:11] appeal
[34:12] what we shall be but you got to
[34:15] recognize what you are now
[34:18] you are now the sons of god
[34:22] and it does not yet appeal
[34:25] amen but we know that when he
[34:28] shall appear that we shall be like him
[34:34] are you with me so i i
[34:38] trust that the revelation of god
[34:42] amen that he will show you by revelation
[34:46] who you are
[34:48] that you can be like him
[34:52] are you up man by faith we
[34:56] understand
[34:59] the bible said the light shining in the
[35:02] darkness and the darkness
[35:03] comprehended it not
[35:07] he said except a man be born again he
[35:10] cannot see
[35:11] he cannot understand the kingdom of god
[35:17] we have come into understanding the
[35:19] kingdom because of the born-again
[35:22] experience
[35:24] the word cannot deny the word
[35:27] because he cannot deny himself
[35:31] are you with me brother and sister you
[35:35] and i
[35:36] we're not just folks that come to church
[35:40] we're not simply just christians that
[35:43] the world called it
[35:46] what we are the word manifested for the
[35:49] hour we live in
[35:53] are you with me so we
[35:56] amen have god's spirit to vindicate who
[36:00] we are
[36:02] accept the water of the spirit that
[36:05] bring the seed to life
[36:08] so the spirit amen is the water that
[36:12] brings the seed to life and vindicate
[36:14] that that's who we are
[36:19] are you with me
[36:23] so we need a vindication they meant
[36:28] god amen will speak for himself
[36:32] he said in the beginning god created the
[36:35] heavenly earth
[36:37] and the earth was without form and void
[36:41] and darkness was upon the face of the
[36:44] deep
[36:45] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[36:48] face of the water
[36:50] amen and god said let there
[36:54] be let there be what
[36:58] let there be light amen i don't care how
[37:02] dark your life
[37:03] is jesus said i am the light of the
[37:06] world
[37:08] and we need light to bring forth the
[37:10] life
