[59:01] oh let the redeemer the lord give him
[59:03] praise tonight
[59:06] hallelujah
[59:08] i'm setting the expectations now
[59:12] the bible in the book of isaiah 59 if
[59:14] you have your bibles just read now
[59:16] you don't have to stand just yet because
[59:18] i got three places i want to leave read
[59:20] from
[59:23] but in isaiah the 59th
[59:25] chapter of isaiah
[59:28] the bible reads in verse 19.
[59:31] so shall
[59:33] they fear the name of the lord from the
[59:34] west
[59:36] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[59:40] when the enemy shall come in like a
[59:42] flood
[59:43] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[59:45] standard against him
[59:47] and the redeemer shall come
[59:50] unto zion
[59:51] and unto them that turn
[59:54] uh
[59:55] from transgression in jacob
[59:58] saith the lord
[1:00:02] as for me this is my covenant with them
[1:00:04] said the lord
[1:00:06] my spirit
[1:00:07] is upon thee
[1:00:09] and my words which i'll put in my mouth
[1:00:12] shall not depart out of thy mouth not
[1:00:15] the mouth of thy seed at the mouth of
[1:00:17] thy seed seed saith the lord from
[1:00:19] henceforth and forever let you say man
[1:00:23] and then in saint john the 12th chapter
[1:00:24] in verse 23
[1:00:26] then i'm going to jump down to verse 27.
[1:00:29] and jesus answered them saying the hours
[1:00:32] come
[1:00:33] that the son of man should be everybody
[1:00:34] say glory of ours
[1:00:36] everybody said with me the hours come
[1:00:40] that the son of man
[1:00:42] should be
[1:00:43] glorified
[1:00:45] notice what verse 27 says now is my soul
[1:00:48] trouble
[1:00:49] and what shall i say father save me from
[1:00:51] this hour
[1:00:53] but for this cause came out unto this
[1:00:56] hour
[1:00:57] notice
[1:00:58] father
[1:01:00] glorified
[1:01:01] thy name
[1:01:05] notice what happened after
[1:01:08] the lord jesus
[1:01:09] cried that out
[1:01:11] then came a voice from heaven saying
[1:01:14] i have both glorified it
[1:01:17] and will glorify it
[1:01:19] again
[1:01:21] oh somebody shout hallelujah
[1:01:24] but i want you to notice something
[1:01:29] i want you to notice something
[1:01:33] when that voice from heaven spoke
[1:01:37] and that voice from heaven spoke about
[1:01:38] the glorification
[1:01:40] of the name
[1:01:43] the people that stood by and heard it
[1:01:46] said that it thundered
[1:01:53] thunder had rode
[1:01:55] and out of that thunder
[1:01:56] came the proclamation
[1:01:59] that the name
[1:02:00] was going to be glorified
[1:02:03] or somebody say glorify your name
[1:02:05] tonight lord
[1:02:10] and notice what the lord
[1:02:12] jesus added
[1:02:14] he said now
[1:02:15] is the judgment of this world
[1:02:18] now shall the prince of this world be
[1:02:21] cast out
[1:02:22] and that i
[1:02:24] if i be lifted up from the earth
[1:02:27] i will draw
[1:02:29] all men
[1:02:30] unto me somebody say amen
[1:02:33] or somebody giving praise right now
[1:02:35] or somebody give him glory right now
[1:02:39] somebody say lord you are worthy of the
[1:02:43] glory
[1:02:48] you can be seated if you were standing
[1:02:51] let me introduce this lesson as as i um
[1:02:54] begin to lay a foundation for
[1:02:57] um
[1:02:58] the inspiration that's on us
[1:03:02] you know the bible says in second
[1:03:03] corinthians the third chapter and i
[1:03:05] don't intend to teach a long time
[1:03:06] tonight but i got to lay some scriptures
[1:03:08] in so that you can understand where i'm
[1:03:09] coming from
[1:03:12] it says but we all would open face
[1:03:14] beholdings as a glass the glory of the
[1:03:16] lord
[1:03:17] are changed into what
[1:03:20] the same image
[1:03:23] from what
[1:03:24] glory
[1:03:25] to
[1:03:26] glory
[1:03:28] even by what the spirit of how many
[1:03:30] believe that you're going to be changed
[1:03:33] come on how many say i'm waiting on my
[1:03:35] chance
[1:03:37] but how you changed
[1:03:40] were changed
[1:03:42] by beholding the glory
[1:03:46] of the lord
[1:03:48] we're changed
[1:03:50] by god opening up our eyes of
[1:03:52] understanding
[1:03:54] we're changed by god opening up uh our
[1:03:58] ears to hear
[1:04:00] we're changed by our hearts receiving
[1:04:03] something from the lord
[1:04:06] and when our eyes are open and when our
[1:04:07] ears open and our heart is open we
[1:04:10] behold the glory
[1:04:14] and when we behold the glory we are
[1:04:17] changed into the same image
[1:04:20] from glory
[1:04:22] to glory
[1:04:24] somebody wave your hands and say lord
[1:04:26] let that happen to me tonight
[1:04:28] oh somebody say lord let that happen to
[1:04:30] me tonight
[1:04:34] i desire
[1:04:36] we all desire
[1:04:38] to see the glory of the lord
[1:04:41] we all thirst for it
[1:04:44] and why because we're made in god's
[1:04:46] image
[1:04:48] and he placed inside of us a thirst
[1:04:51] inside of us
[1:04:53] and that thirst that he placed inside of
[1:04:55] us a prophet said that that thirst that
[1:04:57] he placed inside of us it us is to cause
[1:05:00] us to thirst for him
[1:05:04] it's to cause us to uh uh seek that
[1:05:08] secret place
[1:05:10] amen it causes us to search for that
[1:05:14] secret place
[1:05:16] where the glory
[1:05:17] is revealed
[1:05:19] i thank god for knowledge i i thank god
[1:05:22] for uh the the the understanding but i i
[1:05:26] want to see the glow
[1:05:28] i i desire to see the glow
[1:05:32] thank you jesus in this time a pandemic
[1:05:35] in this time of world turmoil
[1:05:38] in this time where people are dying
[1:05:41] and it's time where people are falling
[1:05:43] out
[1:05:44] when it's time of people leaving god
[1:05:48] the reason why they leaving god is
[1:05:50] because they haven't seen the glory
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:57] the reason why there are questions in
[1:05:59] their mind
[1:06:01] the reason why doubts are ruling their
[1:06:03] lives
[1:06:04] it's because they haven't seen the glory
[1:06:14] you say well bro jackson i i have
[1:06:16] experienced the supernatural
[1:06:20] i've experienced
[1:06:21] uh elements of the supernatural churro
[1:06:25] i've seen the glory
[1:06:27] let me say something to you tonight
[1:06:30] the children israel
[1:06:33] they experienced the supernatural
[1:06:36] and they experienced
[1:06:39] the events in egypt
[1:06:41] when god
[1:06:42] used moses to bring plagues down
[1:06:45] on egypt
[1:06:47] they witnessed
[1:06:49] the plagues
[1:06:51] that the lord had his servants speak and
[1:06:53] bring it to existence
[1:06:56] and they were there that night
[1:06:58] when a deaf angel came to egypt
[1:07:02] they saw they experienced the cries of
[1:07:06] the egyptians
[1:07:08] they experienced the cries of every
[1:07:09] household of egypt

[1:11:21] in verse 12 it reads moses said unto the
[1:11:23] lord see thou sayest unto me bring up
[1:11:25] this people
[1:11:27] and has now let me know whom that will

[1:12:17] he had experienced the commission to go
[1:12:20] down into egypt and bring god's people
[1:12:21] out and god with a mighty hand brought
[1:12:23] god's people out he experienced that
[1:12:26] he experienced all of that
[1:12:28] but here he is
[1:12:30] pleading
[1:12:31] with
[1:12:32] uh

[1:13:58] he felt the need to approach god
[1:14:02] and ask for
[1:14:04] additional
[1:14:05] inspiration

[1:16:25] the name
[1:16:27] of the lord before this somebody say man
[1:16:31] god knew what he needed
[1:16:35] and what he needed
[1:16:37] was another inspiration
[1:16:40] of the goodness of god
[1:16:42] he needed another dip of the name of
[1:16:46] god he needed
[1:16:49] another outpouring of god's grace to
[1:16:53] reveal his name to him
[1:16:56] oh somebody say amen
[1:16:58] oh god i'm getting i'm getting i'm
[1:17:00] getting these these vibes here
[1:17:03] i'm getting these vibes i i know the
[1:17:05] seals i know the church changes that i
[1:17:07] know all of that but you need to know
[1:17:09] the name
[1:17:11] you need to know that name
[1:17:19] thank you jesus
[1:17:21] because there's wizarding is that
[1:17:24] there's power
[1:17:26] in the name
[1:17:28] how many know there's power
[1:17:30] in the name
[1:17:32] how many know that there are another
[1:17:33] name given us
[1:17:35] unto heaven whether we must be saved
[1:17:39] there is power
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:43] there's holy ghost power
[1:17:46] glory to god there's healing power
[1:17:50] there's deliverance
[1:17:52] in the name
[1:17:54] but let me ask you a question
[1:17:56] let me ask you a question tonight
[1:17:58] i i i got i got to say it like this
[1:18:02] you know i i still work
[1:18:05] for my um living and
[1:18:07] i'm not
[1:18:08] complaining about it lord bless me
[1:18:10] tremendously
[1:18:12] and in working i i see names of people
[1:18:14] that work out there
[1:18:16] and just recently i saw the name of a
[1:18:18] spanish guy jesus jesus
[1:18:21] his name is jesus
[1:18:25] and then i thought about that
[1:18:28] i thought about that bro
[1:18:30] i said now his name is jesus
[1:18:34] so i wonder whether he got the power
[1:18:39] jesus jesus
[1:18:41] i said whether he got the power i mean a
[1:18:43] lot of people use the name of jesus
[1:18:47] but how many know many of them don't
[1:18:49] have the power
[1:18:54] they don't have the power
[1:18:57] because there's something
[1:18:59] missing
[1:19:02] there's something missing people use the
[1:19:03] name of jesus
[1:19:05] to curse with it
[1:19:09] they use the name of jesus to swear with
[1:19:11] it
[1:19:14] so there's got to be a distinction
[1:19:17] between
[1:19:19] the use of the name in power
[1:19:21] and the use of the name vainly
[1:19:24] oh somebody say man
[1:19:26] somebody say hallelujah
[1:19:29] there has to be a difference
[1:19:36] notice notice this
[1:19:39] and he said i beseeched he showed
[1:19:41] me the glory in verse 18 and and he said
[1:19:44] i will make all my goodness pass before
[1:19:46] thee
[1:19:47] i will proclaim the name of the lord
[1:19:49] before thee
[1:19:50] and will be gracious to whom i will be
[1:19:52] gracious and will show mercy on whom i
[1:19:54] will show mercy
[1:19:56] and he said
[1:19:57] thou cast not see my face
[1:19:59] but there shall no man see men live
[1:20:02] but the lord said there is a place
[1:20:05] by me
[1:20:06] and thou shalt
[1:20:08] stand
[1:20:10] upon a rock
[1:20:12] hallelujah
[1:20:13] and it shall come to pass while my glory
[1:20:16] passes by thou i'll put thee in the
[1:20:20] cliff
[1:20:22] of the rock
[1:20:24] oh hallelujah
[1:20:26] oh thank you jesus
[1:20:28] what was going on here
[1:20:31] an anointed prophet of god an inspired
[1:20:34] prophet of god who had seen the
[1:20:35] supernatural now wanted to see the glory
[1:20:38] of god
[1:20:39] he wanted to experience more of the
[1:20:41] glory
[1:20:43] he was pleading with the the spirit god
[1:20:46] to show him no glory and the lord said
[1:20:48] i've heard you and here's what i'm going
[1:20:50] to do
[1:20:51] i'm going to show you a place
[1:20:54] and in that place i'm going to place you
[1:20:57] in that place
[1:20:58] and when i place you
[1:21:00] in that place
[1:21:02] my goodness is gonna pass by
[1:21:05] and you're gonna see the back parts of
[1:21:08] me

[1:21:22] place where the lord was bruised

[1:21:29] marred
[1:21:30] for our transgressions
[1:21:33] and the chastisement of our peace was
[1:21:35] upon him
[1:21:36] and with his stripes we're healed

[1:40:23] so i'm getting off
[1:40:25] the platform prepare
[1:40:28] prepare to see me we down in ache and i
[1:40:31] come out with all them books and
[1:40:33] everything
[1:40:34] pile

[1:41:24] how many know the night that he had
[1:41:26] to associate with his name
[1:41:29] these
[1:41:30] characteristics
[1:41:32] you say why didn't the lord when he came
[1:41:35] down why didn't he say that he was

[1:41:42] why didn't he say that he was elohim
[1:41:44] why did he

[1:41:50] why did he show the sevenfold
[1:41:52] characteristics of his glory
[1:41:55] you know why because his name he exalts
[1:41:59] his word above all his name
[1:42:05] the reason why people use the name of
[1:42:07] jesus and don't get no power with it
[1:42:10] it's because they reject the truth
[1:42:14] and when you reject the truth you are
[1:42:17] rejecting the name
[1:42:20] somebody say amen
[1:42:22] when you reject the truth you're

[1:42:55] it was written
[1:42:57] and no man knew it but he himself
[1:43:00] and his name was called the word
[1:43:03] of god
[1:43:05] somebody say man
[1:43:07] hallelujah break it jesus
[1:43:11] and when you receive i'm i'm i'm just
[1:43:13] i'm i'm speaking now because i'm trying
[1:43:15] to come to a close
[1:43:20] when you receive
[1:43:22] the revelation
[1:43:24] of jesus christ
[1:43:26] from genesis to revelation
[1:43:29] and what is it it's the simple gospel
[1:43:33] when you receive the gospel of jesus
[1:43:36] christ

[1:43:41] face of a lion
[1:43:43] one was an ox
[1:43:44] one was the face of a man and one was a
[1:43:46] flying eagle and then he identified
[1:43:49] those four living creatures as the four
[1:43:52] gospels
[1:43:54] he identified them as the gospels
[1:43:56] and he said they're guarding
[1:43:58] they're guarding the throne room
[1:44:01] they're guarding that place where the
[1:44:03] power comes
[1:44:05] they're guarding that place where the
[1:44:07] power comes
[1:44:08] how many believe that tonight say amen
[1:44:11] and what are they revealing they're
[1:44:13] revealing jesus christ
[1:44:15] as the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:44:18] they're revealing jesus christ as the
[1:44:21] king of glory
[1:44:22] they're revealing jesus christ as a man
[1:44:26] they're revealing him as the sacrifice
[1:44:29] and they're revealing him as the eagle
[1:44:33] the world

[1:44:51] we receive the glory of god we're
[1:44:53] receiving the inspiration the revelation
[1:44:55] that the saints of all received on the
[1:44:58] day of pentecost
[1:45:02] i'm about to
[1:45:03] play worse off on the music bro
[1:45:10] the disciples came to the lord and said
[1:45:14] lord tell us your place in the kingdom
[1:45:18] tell us
[1:45:20] what your place is
[1:45:24] they didn't understand his place in the
[1:45:26] kingdom
[1:45:27] and that's the first
[1:45:28] chapter and he said it's not for you to
[1:45:31] know
[1:45:34] it's not for you to know
[1:45:37] right now my place in the kingdom
[1:45:41] but in a little while you're going to
[1:45:42] receive power
[1:45:44] how many believe that he told them
[1:45:46] they're going to receive power
[1:45:48] somebody say lord give me that power
[1:45:54] you're going to receive power
[1:45:57] and when that power comes
[1:45:59] it's going to make you witnesses
[1:46:02] of me
[1:46:04] somebody say lord send me the power
[1:46:09] how many believe when the power will
[1:46:10] come it'll make you witnesses
[1:46:12] of him
[1:46:17] that's what the seals was all about
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:22] and what did the disciples do
[1:46:27] what condition were they in
[1:46:30] they were afraid
[1:46:34] they had walked with jesus but jesus
[1:46:35] wasn't inside of them
[1:46:40] they had walked with him but he wasn't
[1:46:42] inside of him yet
[1:46:47] peter was so scared of getting crucified
[1:46:48] he cursed and swole
[1:46:50] that he wasn't one of them
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:55] and when they went in that upper room
[1:46:56] they were cowards
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:00] afraid
[1:47:04] but they went up in that upper room on
[1:47:06] the 40th day
[1:47:10] and they waited 10 days
[1:47:13] until the day of pentecost was fully
[1:47:15] come
[1:47:16] somebody say let us wait
[1:47:19] until the fullness of pentecost comes
[1:47:22] you all don't hear me tonight
[1:47:23] i'm not talking about pentecostal
[1:47:25] denominations
[1:47:27] because pentecost was the feast of the
[1:47:29] first fruit
[1:47:31] it was a feast of the harvest
[1:47:34] it was the feast where the children of
[1:47:36] israel took the first with the hops and
[1:47:38] waved it to the lord
[1:47:40] how many know tonight that we are trees
[1:47:44] and and we need to bring forth fruit
