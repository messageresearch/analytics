9. god is so good amen ezekiel 9 4 through 10 i'll read the first you'll read the next and we'll read the 10 together and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of the other men the sign cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst their fire slayerly old and young both male and those baits and little children lord have mercy and women but come not near any man upon whom is a mall and began at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house 7. and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said all lord god will thou destroy all the residue of israel in thou pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem 9. together and as for me also my eyes shall not spare neither will i pity but i will recompense their way upon their heads may god bless you read his word you may be seated go back to ephesians 1 from friday night ephesians 1 and i'm just gonna start at the 13th verse ephesians 1 and 13. and uh because we were talking about the seal of god in the mark of the beast we continued on from friday night because i think i was just getting to that particular part so by the grace of god i try to slow it down and and try to teach a little bit or talk to you because i'm not good at teaching so y'all just pray for us amen it says in 1-13 in whom ye also trusted after that she heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye what after you believe you know as i said he said after you after you believe you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise now it's one thing the bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he did believe it not shall be damned now after you believe he said have you i mean you were sealed amen so most of the religious world the christian world teaches that when you believe you have you're born again and you have this holy ghost but the bible teaches us in acts 19 let's go back down just to bring everybody up to pass we're talking about the seal of god in the mark of the beast you realize that they're actually calling the mark that they put upon them that's what kept them from being destroyed but interchanging the mark that ezekiel is talking about with the seal think on it as the seal of god where god sees you amen god put his mark upon you or your life are you with me so i want you to look at um acts uh 19 and i'll show you that the most of the people think that they're born again and think that they have the holy ghost because the preachers teach them that but it does not transform or change their life and neither do they have the power of the spirit because they're being taught that they have what they don't have are you with me you know sometimes folks tell you you got money in the bank and you go down to try to draw it out and you don't you don't have none so don't you know you don't want to try to go into heaven without the baptism of the holy ghost without being born again see john said except a man be born again he cannot what you can't see the kingdom and cannot enter into the kingdom of god isn't that right so you need to be born again as john said to nicodemus you must be born of water and of spirit are you with me not just the water but the water and the spirit okay so uh your your birth is not completed just doing one part you must have both be baptized in the water and you must receive the spirit so oftentimes people say i baptize you in the water in the name of the father son the holy ghost and say you got the spirit you understand but peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive what the holy ghost not that you have it but you shall receive it are you with me okay so a lot of people tell you when you get baptized you have the spirit you're born again now you got to understand that the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost and we want to talk about sealing now you re your reason why mo a lot of people attitudes are so bad in why people are having difficult amen with christians because it's total there's so many christians that don't have the life because they have told them they're born again and they're not living nothing and and it's all right to do something anything the teacher you know it's all right to be a homosexual or whatever you say well you're born again it's all right you know to the living adultery you're born again you believe it you accept the jesus you know what i'm saying so uh being born again it's all right to take a drink and do this smoke you know do anything you're born again you're christian okay now born again i mean just believing and accepting jesus christ is just justification you accept what he's done for you amen it's not what you've done for yourself you're accepting and believing that jesus christ had died for your sin then to believe that and to take that first step but that's not a finished work and we're going to get to hopefully we get to the finishing work that god wants to he may do a complete a finished work in your life amen he just don't want to justify you he want to sanctify you and he wants you to fear you with the spirit are you with me so it's not enough just to start i you know i as i was meditating this morning and praying uh a god you know a lot of folk i i don't care how long they've been coming to church got to go deeper in christ a lot of times as a as a pastor i've seen of many folks over the years over 40 some odd years you know i i i've seen many people say well you know i got the holy ghost and i knew they needed a deeper touch i wasn't going to tell them you know discourage them i knew and then life goes on they might sit around and be in church faithfully for 20 years sometimes 30 years a long time then all of a sudden that man left his wife or the wife left her husband or whatever i all the time i i didn't want to discourage him because they was claiming they needed a deeper touch i call it a deeper touch you know and a lot of times people need a deeper touch and you can tell when their meanness come out of them you know every now and then they buzz off with the temple they get a little nasty attitude and stuff like that you know they need a deeper touch those kind of christians you can't tell them nothing because they're so spiritual and so holy so you can't correct them at all because they're going to correct you when you get through correcting them so they're going to tell you all your faults amen this is like the supervisor on the job trying to point out what he wants you to do and how he don't want you to do it and you turn around telling supervisor what they need to be doing how they need to be running the job you know what i'm saying and you got so many people that can do an expert job at what you do and they can tell you all you don't do that amen the bible says we don't measure ourselves by ourselves amen don't look at another man and try to say well because god might your problem and that personal problem might be a different problem amen when god is working on you you must let god work on you don't look at others and say well listen uh-uh you you let god work on you as an individual because your trial and my trial might not be the same trial what i'm struggling with and what i'm battling with may not be your battle at all that might be something that you're victorious but you can say well uh i can see yours but can you see your own because each and every one of us amen must come to maturity and let's come to perfection and we all are striving for the same thing god to perfect us in our lives each every one of us can look around oh i see this and i see that and all of us would be guilty amen but god looked at us through the blood like he looked at the israelis he said i see no iniquity in jacob as you know balaam tried to curse him amen god said blessed in the man whom the lord were not imputed nicodemy why because god looks beyond what you're seeing in the physical but god looked beyond amen he looked beyond david fought he said he saw david as a man after his own heart are you what man it doesn't matter how amen physically how he looked and all the terrible things he did but god looked at it amen differently and god showed because he's vindicated his life vet with so much supernatural so much of blessing that god continually saw that he was with david in spite of all his faults oh you would be so by the grace of god uh god amen when god's uh uh anointing individual for a particular thing amen nobody can say well why did why god you know god anoints whoever you you know peter looked like he was the fastest one cutting the man ear off with a swole and then cursing and swan and he didn't but god looked beyond peter temple and he saw that one day peter was going to come to the place where he need to be god looked beyond jacob with all his craftiness and know that jacob one day was gonna wrestle with the angel and gonna be a prince with god amen so that's what uh god looks sometimes amen and he sees amen he sees your end he sees uh what's in you he sees your amen hard sometimes we don't know amen so the best the thing is let's just pray one for another okay i'm going the 19 it says he says and he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believe now i i said you'll seal amen with the holy ghost after you believe now the ceiling comes after you believe this is what they say okay i'm gonna read it again in 1901 and it came to pass a while paul says that corinth paul having passed through the overthrows came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost what believes that sense okay they said unto him we have not so much as her whether that be what any holy ghost and he said unto them until what then were you up baptized praise god now and they said unto what you know most of the baptists think john the baptist started their church and they said what they said unto john's baptism john baptized with the baptism look look what he said then said paul uh john verily baptized with the baptism where the repentance sentence the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on who christ jesus and when they heard this they were what lord jesus are you with me see they got baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then what happened did they were they born again did they have the holy ghost no this is what he said and when paul had what the holy ghost came on them and they what they speak with tongues and prophesied you know what i'm saying now tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost amen but many people that received the holy ghost amen speak in tongues are you with me paul said i would that you all speak with tongues not that the tongues were the holy ghost the holy ghost is jesus christ amen it's the person of jesus christ in you amen so when jesus is in you he began to live his life through you are you with me see because a lot of people think that amen jesus is in them and and sometimes amen they got a little potion but they don't have the fullness of what they need to have and that's why people don't oftentimes they don't go deep enough they don't go farther enough in christ amen and sometimes you can't tell them nothing because they meant they've been serving the lord for 20 35 boy i've been serving the love for you were born and see what i'm saying how can you correct them how can you tell them you need a deeper touch sister brother you need a deeper touch are you with me but you just keep on believing god to touch them in a greater way sometimes it's on the deathbed for many people god gives them that deepness on their deathbed and uh because they come to a total surrendered place and sometimes some tragic happens in life till they realize i need more of god's situations come in life that cause people to become desperate sometimes sickness come in the body they get desperate with god they begin to yield itself fully to god and say god i need you now i need you more than i ever needed you before lord i'm not in the right place i realized amen i'm not as strong as i thought i was i'm not as you know i i'm not where i need to be and sometimes they begin to yawn in their spirit and cry to god it's only until those people get in those places do they realize amen i'm not where i need to be in god and sometimes i don't care how how much you cry and how much you come to the altar and how much you feel like you're repenting amen you still don't go far enough are you look man see sometimes amen it has to be sometimes we have to separate ourselves from all unbeliefs everything that's holding us back everything amen that we're doing amen that's not pleasing god we got to come to the point that we got to be willing to give it up and we want the seal of god in our life we want the baptism of the holy ghost we got to give up we got to come clean amen and and sometimes we're not willing to amen to give up all these things for the baptism of the holy ghost we're not willing to get surrender our whole life to god we we want to say lord i surrender all that i mean that's a good thought and a good saying amen but you can see the stubbornness and the rebellious in folks sometimes that said i surrender all amen you know sometimes people think amen that that i brother simmers you want to have preeminence over me you want to tell me how to run my life but you're only telling them what the word of god said for their own benefit amen you're trying to help them amen because you see down the road amen all your rebellion and all your rejection we know what is waiting on you down the road it's going to make your life more difficult it's going to make your walk even more harder to walk that the walk amen that straight narrow way we know all about that we know amen that you're going to have struggles we know that you're going to need to be stronger we know that when you come down to your tests when things are amen amen when your battle really gets hard and aiming to roll really get rough and tough it means that you're going to need that deeper walk with god you're going to need that place where you know amen that you know that you know that god is my god and i know i trust you lord you're going to need him when you walk through the valleys and shadows of death amen you're gonna have to have something that amen you're gonna have to have something down deep that said i will fear no evil because i know that you're with me lord i know no god i know you're with me praise god it won't be no more just intellectual knowledge just amen you can't take your meanness in there praise god you can't take your temple over there praise god you can't take your nasty attitude there praise god it's going to be perfect love and nothing else praise god it's going to be perfection amen it's going to be godliness amen not your type of godliness but it's going to be jesus christ are you with me it's going to be jesus living his life through you what a wonderful thing that jesus could come in tabernacle in human flesh and give us of his spirit and live in our lives what a wonderful thing that god has done for you and i that are willing to surrender and willing to subject ourselves and willing to lay down our amen praise god lay down our lives and lay down our thoughts and our ideals and take up our cross and follow him what is it amen brothers and sisters means everything praise god you know i was just meditating on the lord and i says you know we spend too much time on all the other stuff and you you i don't care how big a christian you think you are but you got too much baggage brother called me the other day from new york and i hadn't heard from him oh almost 20 years and he was telling me he said brother simmons you know i'm not where i need to be he said but i guess he's seen this on the internet or something and he says and i appreciate the brother and he started telling me he says i hadn't seen you almost 20 years he said but you know i got to be honest with you she said i believe the lord is soon to come he said i know in my spirit i know i ain't where i need to be and i know i'm not serving the law he said i got too many weights and i know i i'm weighted down and i got to get rid of these weights that i have and i'm honest with you i got weights and i got situations that i got to get out of if i'm gonna make it but he said i know for sure that the lord is soon to come he said i can look around and i can see the signs of the time and [Music] man he could not preach me on the phone but knowing that he ain't ready so i told him where the church was in the bronx and so forth i i mean i gave him the pastor's number that he could go to church there if he wants to but by the grace of god now i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister uh you can you can know it you can know the lord is soon to come you can know things are right not right in your life but what you're gonna do about it or you're gonna still take the weights that you know that's weighing you down and you still gonna hold on to it some folk you know they come and i pray for them and i know they ain't everything don't give up nothing you know so we spent all kind of time trying to make money trying to get a bigger house a better job a better dance and better dad a better education better this year i'm gonna tell you something all that stuff they don't mean nothing if you ain't got god first if you don't have diet first i don't care what you get if you ain't got god first if he's not your mane and he's not number one i'm gonna tell you something he ain't gonna be second to none are you up man so you got to realize that god is not going to take second place god gonna have first place and no place are you a man so whatever's going on in your life that you think you know you can hardly get a group of people out the prayer service to pray and i'm gonna tell you something on wrong there's something mighty terrible wrong with people's lives they won't pray i don't care what you say you know i said what are these people going to happen no i don't believe so i'm gonna i'm gonna be honest with you people that really want to get a closer walk with god it's gonna be some praying people and they don't mind praying because they know they need it oh he was man if we ever needed to pray he said those that sigh and cry because the abomination done in the city put a mark upon them amen when we see all this evil and all those dollars and all this filthiness coming to the earth and we ain't shining crying lord you watch over my children watch over my family god i need you to keep me every day god i know my oh lord if you ain't signing crying for so oh hallelujah you know you you if you don't sign cry your children ain't doing it your wife might not be doing it your husband might not be doing it but you got the sign stand in the gap for them make up the heads pray for them because you know they're not praying for themselves amen and when you do that the god can turn their hearts god can watch over them that the enemy don't destroy him amen because the enemy will come and destroy you if he can but the prize of the saints is keeping the judgment from hitting the earth are you with me but one day those prayers are going to be over because the saints will be gone and the earth is gonna amen experience the wrath of god things will go up and the wrath of god's going to come down are you with me oh now i i i was talking about the seal of god and and uh a finish the seal represents a finished transition uh transaction or finished work let's go to jeremiah excuse me i'm trying to teach him i got caught up for a moment there y'all part me okay but um i lord let me honestly be concerned about your soul it's not how much money you can give it's not you know uh you know i was talking to one of the young men that was with me when i was younger the first young man we married and all and and i thank god for him and they lived a you know pretty good life he passes the church and i was talking to him and telling him amen a lot of i said i appreciate you brother i appreciate you appreciate your life that you live amen i see you don't have to do nothing for me but you're my joy to see that amen after 40 years 47 years you're still holding on to the lord your wife holding on you taught your children amen the ways of the lord amen and i can see paul said my joy in my crown amen it's telling the young brother this morning and i said that's that's my joy to see the children of god walking in the light see that all this that's gone breaking loose on the earth to see a child of god still holding on i hadn't had a uh what a pastor anniversary and church anniversary and this and that i hadn't had none of that stuff amen but one thing about about me i hadn't worried about that stuff you said is it all right yeah that's all right to have those things but the thing is what means more to me is to see you walking right and living right if you do that i'm satisfied that means more and then buying me a nice uh cadillac or nice and mercedes or whatever just to see you living right if you're living right you know that doing more for me amen see you're loving the lord raising your family right raising your children to love god more than anything amen putting them first in all things amen that means a lot amen they see you walking in the light every time i look around the city and around the world and different people when they call me up and amen and i just appreciate that that you know you can be an instrument can be somebody that could tell god somebody praise god somebody you know i you know i thank the lord amen and that's what it means brother and sister when it's all over whatever all the other stuff that you've done it ain't gonna mean nothing but those that you won the christ only that which is done for christ will last all that other stuff that you achieve and accomplish ain't gonna mean nothing over there where we going and none of that's gonna mean a thing praise god and all folks say about you do tell you that all of that's gonna be over with after a while anyway so you ain't got to worry about it because that you you ain't taking it over there so you might as well just leave it on amen you might want to say well i everything amen because that's yo that's your joy and your crown you overcame how did you overcome in love you overcame all the obstacles all the things that were ever done to you by the love of god you overcame that's your victory if you don't have to go through nothing how are you going to have any victory how are you going to be an overcomer amen the things that you suffer amen when you get over there you say thank you lord for allowing me to hold to your unchanging hand in spite of all the difficulties and all the snails and all the traps and all the talking about all i've been to thank you lord thank you lord god you did it for me god you did it for me spite of all you did it for me oh yes brother and sister it'll be worth it all when you amen when you cross over there it'll be all over amen we got something to praise the lord about we got something to be thankful to god about so we're talking about the seal of god and the mark of the beast are you with me so in on jeremiah 32 we're talking about we said it was three things we're talking about the seal represent to finish war uh that it's a finish work uh transaction or finish work we're talking about it represents ownership and we talk about the seal represents security so it's three things if you're taking notes okay finish work or finish transition the transition transaction ownership and security okay so by the grace of god the seal of god now you got to uh examine your walk with christ and see whether or not you uh believe in yourself that you're sealed now i i told you all the time on my christian walk i i knew i wouldn't see him i knew i hadn't you know i i hadn't come to the place my face you haven't come into the place where you you know you you almost uh scared you might backslide i don't know what about some of y'all but i i was in that place as a young christian uh fearing that you know i god uh you know you're begging god every day hey lord help me you know you stand on your prayer on your knees day and night asking god to keep you because you're in a place now that you know you're bathed in christ and and you know you just you know so many things that you got to overcome and you got to know you're strong enough to keep on moving on but as a baby state i you know you have struggles you have things that you're facing in your life and you know you hadn't got that deeper walk yet you know you you had a man you hadn't got so far over praise god but some people didn't don't go through that struggle so i said lord help me the whole long you know and i i i kind of count the first year and i i kind of attracted my first year my my first year journey i said lord if you could keep me you know i i've been out there a little bit i've been out there thinking that i was somebody but i said lord if you can just keep me just one year you know i i believe that i'll be i i'll cross over somewhere and i and i i stayed in prayer amen oh i was confronted with things but i wanted to be kept or you would be so you battled in proud constantly in prayer doing everything you you and god kept me you know and i said how can i let a year being in christ pass me by amen how can i go back and start amen this stuff but you know god was sealing me away amen but it it it it took uh uh steps amen in my life and amen and god was proving himself faithful to me because i knew in this journey that i wasn't able to keep myself and i wasn't able to i wasn't strong enough to to be able to endure i knew that i i knew i needed him to do it for me because i told him i said lord i knew you were able to keep that which i've committed unto you against that day and lord i've committed my life to you and i'm asking you lord constantly keep that which i've committed unto you he said you don't have to beg the lord to do that he's gonna do that i said but you know when you you're a young baby and young christian amen you you don't know how to approach him you're just telling him you know constantly lord amen you come down to your tests you the lord you are able to keep that which i've committed unto you and sometimes people say amen oh boy you stronger than me oh you so strong i said no i asked god to keep that which i've committed in him it's the god is the strong one i'm the weak one and i realize that and i always keep that in my mind that i know i can't keep myself if i'm gonna be kept it's gonna be him that keep me praise god so uh jeremiah 32 and 11. jeremiah was told about the field uh that a bearing field that he might be buried in this particular field and i'm going to tell you something there's something about them having a barrier place because joseph when he got ready to leave uh when the children were illegal was to leave egypt joseph was told he said you know i don't want you to bury me in egypt are you with me he was careful to tell them when you leave egypt take my bones with you praise god i want you to bury me amen with my father with my mother bury me he had a certain birthing place where he wanted to see god just don't want you to be buried anywhere amen see some folk will bury you just uh in egypt or in anywhere is it how you want to be baptized we'll baptize you any way you want them amen but he said when you leave here bury me take my bones with you praise god i'm gonna tell you brother sister amen he wanted to be buried in the place where the resurrection was going to take place amen are you what man because he knew one day job said though the skin worms eating my flesh yet in my flesh shelves i'll see god and joe said i know at the latter day i stand upon the earth praise god i know one day that my redeemer lived amen i know one day amen i'm going to stand up praise god hallelujah i'm gonna get up job had that confidence amen and there was something about those kings that died they were buried with their father and some of them didn't you didn't care about jezebel let the dogs eat the bones or whatever praise god you know and those are wicked kings don't bury them with the good canes are you up man i'm going to tell you something that's why it makes a difference while you're buried praise god because when you're buried amen you've got to be buried in the place where the resurrection going to take place amen praise god if you're buried right you can rise right go hallelujah bury me amen i i preached that uh i think over in in jamaica and and i think they baptized more people than they ever baptized at one time bury me in christ are you with me and i i bury me in jesus because that's the place of the resurrection bury me in jesus amen praise god i want to be baptized in the name of jesus christ i'm going to tell you brother and sister so when i said the finished work uh finished transition transaction okay uh 32 and and 11. he said jeremiah 32 and 11. so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law of and custom and that which was over and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto barack baruch and the son of narayana the son of sir okay in the sight of my hannah leo my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses and subscribe the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the courts of the prison amen so it was the evidence of the transaction sealed amen he said both which was sealed i'm talking about when you seal amen it's a finished word the transaction has been finished are you with me jesus on the cross he said it is it is finished amen praise god uh uh paul talks about and i i mean they talk about it in acts he said he said that you are the purchase of the blood of jesus christ the church of god which he's purchased with his own blood all right are you up man so when jesus died on the cross shedded his blood he said he gave up the ghost and he talked he said it's finished amen so you're the purchase you've been purchased with the blood of jesus christ are you with me the bible tells us we've been born with the love bought with the price the price that has been paid was the blood of jesus christ he he purchased you with his own blood okay so in uh that i think i'll i'll just leave it there because there's more scriptures that i can go to and the next part is on oh no praise god excuse me jeremiah 9 it reads that and i bought the field of hallelujah the uncle's son and was in antarctic and the weight the money even uh 17 shackles of silver and subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took the witnesses and wed the money in the balance okay and then he says only says and no praise god that's that's good enough amen uh if you read the whole book of jeremiah 32 you'll find out the things that we're saying amen first of all it's it's talked about offending he finished your transaction transaction amen next of all it showed that ownership next of all it showed that you're secured amen i'm gonna talk about you know some people don't feel i say because you don't go deeper though you don't feel like yo your christian walk is secure and it's not not secure a lot of people don't have security you know they don't have eternal security a lot of people they don't feel secure and they're not secure what they'll want because they know they're not secure and how many how long will you not a walk in security know that you're secure know that you're safe for some people uh they they they walk and they walk trembling scared and fearful that anytime they can backside anytime they can go out and commit adultery or fornicate or do any kind of thing anytime they can do it because why they're not secure anytime they can pull up for pornography and start watching it again because they are not what they're not secure in their walk they hadn't gone deep enough and and so so it's so many people that are so insecure if it's ever been an hour where christians i i'm talking about uh whereby christians seem to be more secure ever ever many times i'm talking about grand mamas and granddaddies i'm talking about folks that have been supposed to serve in the lord uh uh whole i'm talking about if it's anybody ever ever been a time when folks are insecure amen i'm going to tell you something in your house you don't feel secure on your job you don't feel everything is uh your job and you just think amen i'm on the job 25 years amen i got a retirement i can set back and knowing that this job i got job security amen but in the church people used to come and they get filled with the holy ghost and they feel secure people come and they say i'm filled with the holy ghost and they ain't secure because they say it praise god it's something that's got an ankle in your soul praise god what's it once the holy ghost come and see you it you can't seal yourself that's right amen you can't feel yourself with the holy ghost you can say i'm filled but you can't feel yourself that's right the holy ghost is the evidence that the blood has been applied praise god uh you know you might claim the blood you can claim it all you want amen until the blood claims you are you with me the blood claims you and let you know amen that you are my son and you i'm well i'm pleased to dwell are you up man so it's a different thing when the blood has secured you and you're not walking in your own security because your security will fail you praise god if you're trusting in yourself you gonna fail praise god it's time up brother sister it's late in the evening it's time up for we uh i mean for people to keep on coming to church pay your tithes and your offerings it's still not holy it's time out for that praise god it's time to make a real commitment to christ it's time to sell out sell everything you have and come and follow jesus well come on brother sister come on amen come on let's get down to business with god amen that i want the power of god in my life god i want to save deliverance in my life i want my soul to be delivered i want my family to be delivered god i need deliverance oh yes i do praise god now revelation 13. i gotta kind of come to my conclusion in a minute here but it's something about the insecurity of the church i mean i i believe that the church is the place that you ought to come to and know that you're secured amen that you've come to the city of refuge an avenger cannot come into that city amen praise god once you've uh escaped amen to pursue amen though and you know you've entered into the city of refuge praise god amen but look at what what ezekiel said he said uh he said concerning jerusalem and concerning the house of god he said i want you to begin amen the slave of the and begin at my sanctuary amen i want you to begin in my sanctuary brother and sister don't you think because you were in the church you're going to escape the wrath of god he said began at my sanctuary praise god i want you to know amen the bible said if it was possible he'd receive even the very lay but for the elect's sake he's shown in the days brother and sister it's coming a time amen all your foolishness amen praise god you're going to find out that you hadn't deceived god amen the bible said there'll be the silvers and being deceived deceiving their own self praise god you'll never deceive god you might deceive most of the people in the church you might deceive but you in your heart knowing the heart knows his own wickedness are you with me praise god you got to come down to business that i if i'm going to surrender i'm going to surrender everything god i've got to surrender everything praise god i've got to come all the way with god amen i need a uh cleaning out praise god i need to know amen praise god like joel i know my redeemer live i need to know that amen i have the baptism of the holy ghost and the jesus christ is real to me amen the power of god is here present in me he's walking in me praise god lord philippians said being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work is able to perform it until the day of jesus christ amen he's able to perform it oh god revelation 13 i'm uh i i got to come on to i said the mark of the beast is it real i said the other night that many people are scared afraid i ain't gonna receive tomorrow i ain't getting that shot no i ain't gonna get that shot man you got a bigger shot in the shot oh brother and sister they weren't about to shot but they already shot the devil already didn't inject him praise god hallelujah he's injecting them with sin and the wages of sin is what and the devil has injected them with that they praise god but there is an antidote praise god amen they searching and they amen they come up with an antidote for corona virus but thank god that it's an outer dog for sin and that is the blood of jesus are you with me but people do they want the blood to wash them praise god to keep oh hallelujah that contains this disease from off of them that's the prince and the power of the air he meant that you can wear mass but he can get under the mask women you can take the physical injection for coronavirus but you're still dealing with amen the injection of sin and praise god but that is a praise god hallelujah oh god can do something for you praise god that coronavirus you look at it in the face said oh death where's the strain praise god oh grave why is that victory praise god you can look at the devil it's the devil i ain't scared of you praise god why to live is christ and that dies again what am i worried about praise god brother and sister you got to know where you're standing amen you got to know who you believe brother and sister your security people don't feel safe and secure not even coming to church because corona is out but there's a worse enemy this hour than corona they're the worst disease that's out and that's called sin praise god and all his demons are in the prince and the power of the air are you with me people ain't scared of that praise god they're going to get them a drink anyhow are you up here they're going to smoke they joints anyhow come on somebody but they said i ain't going to receive the mark of the beast i got to get there do you love the lord this morning do you know that he's good don't you know he loves you don't you know he cares more about you than you care about your own self are you with me do you count the blood of jesus his dying or worthy or do you say well you died for my sin but i you didn't have to because i i i i i want to be a sinner you see what kind of choices people make they make dreadful choices somebody said well i didn't pay the price for you to have eternal life you said i don't want it you mean to tell me you died that i can have eternal life but i you know if i if i go to hell because i'm gonna i will have me some fun if i go to hell for having fun then let me go cause a lot of people you know we used to do successive crazy stuff ain't it when we was crazy we said some crazy stuff didn't it yeah you know you said james brown gonna be in hell so let me go on there with him some crazy stuff you know folks used to call the names of people the ones that's out there leading the way elvis and all kind of names you know and people thought that when they get to hell they mean they're going to have a lot of people that wouldn't abroad is the way to lead it to what destruction isn't that right straight in but you know what when it all boils down we're going to wish we made the right decision you know i i said in the prisons all over the state of south carolina especially young men i i sat there with them the young ladies i sat there with them and as i look at them in the comm the things that they've done something i'm facing 20 30 years and they're sitting there telling me their stories you know and i sat there and look at them what what can i do some says well i never came forget the young man he said i was in med school and i want to get back out i want to go back to med school i want to be a doctor he said but i made the wrong choice he said you know anybody can help me because i you know i made a bad decision one time i said well bro you know i got a cousin that's so and so on and i will see but to see the pain of making the wrong choice it don't take but a moment to make the wrong choice but it don't take about a moment to make the right one too are you real man you can make the right decision in a moment and you can make the wrong one in just a moment and your whole life is destroyed by making the wrong choice and your whole life can be saved by making the right choice are you with me so that's up to you i'm glad that god came by and brought conviction to my heart as a young man because my pathway you know i can look at most of my friends and most of the fellows to play ball with me most of them was dead before they got out of their 20s or they were serving life sentences and some of them was bound to professional ball but they got caught up in the drug scene and i look around and i see him and i said i said lord you spared me you spared me you came to me as a young person and you gave me that opportunity to make that decision to make that choice and i'm glad that god touched my heart and i made the right decision i don't i don't regret it i missed out on my youth they say i missed out on all the pledges of this life they say because all i know is the lord jesus he he hasn't failed me yet he's good to me and i thank god how many of you thank god for the decision you made to serve christ i said i was going to get there but it seemed like that's another whole story if i don't do nothing to read then greeting ought to be enough 13 and 14 revelation and it is saving them to dwell on the earth by the means of the miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the what beast sand to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wounded by a sword and did live and he had power to give life into the image of the beast and that image that the image of the beast should both speak and calls and calls that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be what i'm gonna tell you the supreme court is making some drastic decisions right now and you can see what who the supreme court justices are and i'm saying you can find out who the senators and representatives are and who the president is remember if it was possible to see the very lay it's going to come down to a religious small it won't be a computer it won't be a shot an injection but it won't be russia it won't be communism because it never that'll never deceive the very land it's got to be close to you like it was jesus judas was to jesus he said friend treasure me with a kiss could it be so close to you the one that went out and cast out devils and came back and you know what are the twelve could that one be right here among you that would cause you if you would not receive the mark but you need to know what it is you see the mark of god the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost if that's spiritual wouldn't the mark of the beast be likewise are you with me so brother and sister we are right at that point that people are don't know what's going on but it's working underground by the time it come out it's too late by the time it hit the earth you see the whole world was paralyzed by coronavirus what if the antichrist come and take over boom overnight if coronavirus could do that what if the anti-christ come boom take over people said well i thought the rapture takes place full of tribulation rather than says it did but did you miss it why because you failed to get that deeper walk you just wanted to be do enough just to say i'm in the church and and i'm saved that's all you wanted you didn't want to go see how you all ran now are you with me see how your lamps went out are you with me because you didn't do the extra you didn't think it's necessary to do the extra that deeper walk that you were satisfied with just going to church and just you know i i'm religious i'm saved and i ain't worrying about nothing you know we got that nonchalant attitude but it's it's a folks that's serious about god and serious about their walk serious about their soul put a mark upon them all the rest of them don't worry about it praise god because the one with the writers ink horn the one with the destroyed weapon coming through amen and he looking for those that got the mark if they don't have the mark he says slam children are you up man so it's common brothers and sisters right around the corner maybe later than you think and we think what we can do to do what we're doing and and just do our little thing and we can do it and we think we're getting by just do it just go and do it i've seen the results of folks that take christ's life i've seen the results of parents that take god's light put things before god how they re ready children they read the children like their spirits are praise god if they're praying and seeking god their children ain't praying and seeking god if they ain't faithful to god the children ain't faithful to god i'm not saying for you to look at my children because my children ain't perfect either but i thank god for them are you with me and i want you to know amen praise god teach them to pray come to prayer service bring them put them on their knees bring them up in prayer and consecrate in their lives read your bible have your your bible lessons them know to get getting something inside them read them if you don't do them a read bringing the children up every year we'll finish i believe we finished the whole bible reading from genesis revelation everybody got grown and we don't quite finish but we still do our reading amen bring them up right yes somebody said brother simmer how hi what you what did you do i didn't well how did you do it don't try to god gonna give you the wisdom to you pray to him he'll he'll tell you how to deal with your children how to raise your children because you try to raise your children like me all you're doing is copycat but god don't give you wisdom how to deal with your house just like every pastor has to have wisdom how to deal with his house those that god gave him and you can only deal with if you pray and ask god how can i reel my child right how can i do this help me amen praise god you got to pray hard now you don't stop praying when they get grown and thinking that amen they're grown and they're gone some folks said it'll be around your feet and around your ankle and then on you know but when when they get up they'll be on your heart when they get grown they own your heart are you with me so by the grace of god the whole the older people i'm old folks now but you know they used to tell you that stuff so you have to pray hard i'm encouraging you to stand in the gap make up the hedge to pray sign cry for your family for your children for each other's for your brothers and sisters for amen for the needs of that that's in your life sign cry find a place find a safe place where you can cry inside because i i feel like people are praying and crying but they're crying for what they want so many people come to the prayer service and they own their need they faithful crying for what they want oh i know uh since the song brother so-and-so out of the process of crying and signing and whipping for what they want you say oh i see them faithful oh lord man those kind of prayers come on we want somebody to sign cry that god can take over because we don't know how to pray as we ought to but the spirit itself will make intercession for us with groans that cannot be uttered are you with me praise god it's not because i i pray i pray yeah you pray pray pray but selflessly you want to pray what do you mean where you can touch god and god can come down and do something for the people and do something for you god can start talking back to you amen i don't want to be selfish in my prayer i want the holy ghost to take hold to my prayer and i want god to pray and intercede and call names that i don't normally call amen amen he might reach back 20 years he might reach forward praise god but god knows let the holy ghost take over when the last time the holy ghost took over your prayer meeting when last time you prayed until something happened to god was there when you broke down and tears and you cried and you began to speak in tongues and you began to prophesy and you began to say god have your way when the last time god got a hold of your prayer you know god got a hold to you when's the last time you prayed until you got a breakthrough put a mark upon them that sign cried because abomination praise god somebody got a break too brother since it's time to get a breakthrough it's time to go deeper it's time to go farther god bless you i hadn't gotten down to where i need to get about the mark of the beast but stay tuned it's coming amen praise god the next episode stay tuned you pray and if it's the lord's will we gonna get through this are you with me god bless you let us stand [Applause] hallelujah father in jesus name lord after what you've done the other day in louisville kentucky i can't come back to columbia south carolina and be
