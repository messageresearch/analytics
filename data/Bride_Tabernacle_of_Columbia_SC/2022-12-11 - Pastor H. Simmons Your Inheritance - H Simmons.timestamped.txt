[38:48] his own will twelve
[38:55] in whom ye also trusted after ye have
[38:59] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[39:02] your salvation and whom after ye
[39:06] after that ye believed you will sealed
[39:09] with the Holy Spirit of Promise together
[39:11] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[39:15] until the Redemption of the purchased
[39:17] possession unto the praise of his glory
[39:20] may God bless these words you may be
[39:22] seated
[39:25] God is good amen
[39:27] I want to talk to you about your
[39:29] inheritance this morning
[39:32] you you and I as children of God have an
[39:36] inheritance
[39:37] you know some of us have been haven't
[39:40] been born in
[39:42] you know some of the prominent families
[39:44] of the Earth
[39:46] and uh
[39:48] so you don't when you the your loved one
[39:52] your father died he may not have nothing
[39:56] to leave behind it perhaps at the best
[40:00] it might be in-house or maybe a car or
[40:04] something like that
[40:05] so your inheritance in this world Amen
[40:09] some people are privileged to receive
[40:11] millions of dollars and the yachts and
[40:16] vacation homes and you know slow cars
[40:21] so but
[40:24] most of us in here if we can get it you
[40:27] know the parents leave the house
[40:29] and maybe our automobile or something
[40:31] like that
[40:32] and maybe um
[40:34] maybe have a life insurance policy of
[40:37] ten or twenty thousand dollars and you
[40:40] may have a little something left over
[40:42] after the funeral
[40:44] but
[40:47] The Inheritance that we're talking about
[40:52] is incorruptible
[40:55] your inheritance is an eternal
[40:57] inheritance
[40:59] amen
[41:01] what the father our father has left his
[41:05] children
[41:07] are you with me
[41:09] you know I was so excited
[41:11] this morning I didn't know how I talked
[41:14] a little bit to brother Chapel because
[41:16] he usually get here early I was so
[41:18] excited I was down on my Niche praying
[41:20] and
[41:21] and I started thinking about my
[41:22] inheritance
[41:25] and not only did I think about it
[41:28] I I I I started feeling so good because
[41:34] you know when your mind uh forget about
[41:36] this world and this life here but think
[41:39] about what God has in store for you
[41:43] amen how blessed we are to be saved
[41:48] you know I thought about all those that
[41:51] made me have drunk wine or alcohol or
[41:54] whatever or gotten high and I thought
[41:56] about I said you know I wouldn't
[41:58] exchange what God has given us for no
[42:02] wine no alcohol no
[42:05] joint or none of that stuff amen because
[42:08] God has given us
[42:10] amen such an incredible gift
[42:15] the Bible says in in the 13th in whom
[42:18] after you trusted
[42:24] in whom also you trust and after ye
[42:27] heard the word of gospel the truth of
[42:31] the Gospel your gospel your salvation in
[42:35] whom after that you believe ye will
[42:39] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[42:42] I I wonder
[42:47] the earnest of your inheritance
[42:51] what God has invested and what God has
[42:54] given us right now
[42:56] you know I I know we got something that
[42:59] we're looking forward to in the future
[43:03] but I started feeling
[43:05] amen my inheritance
[43:08] it made me feel so good to know what I
[43:10] have Amen in the inside
[43:15] I mean it's real
[43:17] it's it's not just a feeling
[43:21] it's a possession God has given us amen
[43:25] favor
[43:27] Hallelujah
[43:30] I mean
[43:31] I can't explain it you got to you know
[43:35] it's like the man was
[43:38] eating the apple and he says
[43:42] you know or whatever he says is it sweet
[43:47] you can't testify whether it's sweet or
[43:49] bitter
[43:50] because you're not eating it
[43:53] but if you took a bite of it you'd know
[43:56] with the sweeter better isn't that right
[43:59] it's just like God if you never
[44:01] experienced the power and the love of
[44:04] God in a real genuine way
[44:07] but if you ever get it
[44:09] [Music]
[44:11] if you ever experience it right
[44:16] you wouldn't sell it out for nothing
[44:20] somebody said I would take nothing from
[44:22] my journey
[44:23] you have an inheritance
[44:28] let me let me
[44:32] in the 14th verse he said which is the
[44:35] earnest of your inheritance until the
[44:36] Redemption of the purchased possession
[44:40] until the praise of his glory
[44:44] wherefore our soul after that you've
[44:47] heard
[44:49] after I heard of your faith in the Lord
[44:53] Jesus Christ the love unto all the
[44:56] saints cease not to give thanks for you
[45:00] making mention of you in my prayers that
[45:03] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[45:07] the father of Glory
[45:09] may give you
[45:11] given to you
[45:15] unto you spiritual
[45:19] Spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[45:23] knowledge of him
[45:25] that's what we're missing
[45:31] the wisdom
[45:33] in Revelation
[45:35] in the knowledge of him
[45:38] that's what it's missing
[45:42] that God would give it to you
[45:45] see we've spent our time as Christians
[45:48] worrying about things that does not
[45:50] matter
[45:54] the devil would always keep your mind
[45:56] entangled with the fans of this life
[46:01] he will keep you looking at
[46:03] the the five sentences and what we feel
[46:07] the affection conscious memory and all
[46:10] of that imagination but if you can ever
[46:13] think about amen what God has what you
[46:17] inherited from God your inheritance
[46:21] oh God
[46:23] it'll turn you away from all the things
[46:27] that Fades away
[46:30] these temporal things but the things
[46:33] that are Eternal that's the things that
[46:35] matter
[46:37] amen this life is only but for a moment
[46:40] it's a little while it's like a fire
[46:43] flower amen it's like grass and wiggles
[46:46] like the flowers they faded but one
[46:49] thing about the God

[1:26:52] I'm gonna tell you something
[1:26:54] it's nothing compared to the love of God
[1:26:59] the love that God has for you
[1:27:02] it's precious
[1:27:04] and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:27:07] if you ever experience his love
[1:27:12] not a boyfriend not a girlfriend a
[1:27:15] husband a wife

[1:27:25] you know you can't love right
[1:27:29] until you get this kind of love
[1:27:31] it's God's love for you

[1:27:41] brother Tim
[1:27:52] environment
[1:28:15] and my daughter she's got a little
[1:28:18] problem
[1:28:19] and I said
[1:28:21] I got rental property
[1:28:23] and my family said 10 months to sell it
[1:28:26] I said no I can't sell it I got a
[1:28:29] daughter that I got to take care of when
[1:28:31] I'm dead and gone
[1:28:34] and so things went along real good
[1:28:37] and I went from one building to the next
[1:28:39] building
[1:28:41] but to show you how God do things
[1:28:44] when I left
[1:28:46] all that club and stuff alone
[1:28:49] I sit for a little while
[1:28:51] then one of the same buildings that I
[1:28:54] had a long time ago when I explained
[1:28:57] Paul in the record shopping
[1:28:59] all kinds of stuff
[1:29:01] the building came open
[1:29:04] it was Cook's Bakery
[1:29:06] but when I had it it was called
[1:29:10] music wholesalers an ice cream parlor
[1:29:13] and I was in there one day
[1:29:15] and I said I would love to have that
[1:29:17] building
[1:29:18] I want to do something with my life
[1:29:21] I want to leave my children something
[1:29:24] I start reading the Bible when I start
[1:29:26] coming over here pretty much even though
[1:29:29] my father was a pastor but you know you
[1:29:31] you get straight away
[1:29:33] and you want to come back home
[1:29:35] where you need to be
[1:29:38] so the building came up and and I said
[1:29:41] well I'ma take the building
[1:29:44] and I told my son
