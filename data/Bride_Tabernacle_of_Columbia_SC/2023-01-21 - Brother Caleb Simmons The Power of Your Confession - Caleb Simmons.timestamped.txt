[30:45] amen
[30:47] amen let's turn to the Book of Luke Luke
[30:50] chapter 7.
[30:58] Luke chapter 7 and we'll start in verse
[31:01] 1.
[31:13] amen when you got it say Amen
[31:16] and it reads
[31:18] now we he had ended all his Sands in the
[31:21] audience of the people he entered into
[31:24] Capernaum in a certain Centurion servant
[31:27] who was dear unto him was sick and ready
[31:30] to Jive to die
[31:32] and when he heard of Jesus he sent unto
[31:35] him the Elder of the Jews besieging him
[31:38] that he would come and heal his servant
[31:40] and when he came to Jesus there besought
[31:43] him instantly saying that he was worthy
[31:47] for him
[31:48] for whom he would he should do this
[31:53] for he loved our nation and he has built
[31:56] us a synagogue and Jesus said unto them
[31:59] and when he was not now not far from the
[32:02] house the Centurion sent friends to him
[32:05] saying not to him Lord trouble not
[32:08] thyself for I am not worthy that thou
[32:11] is entered unto my roof where
[32:14] wherefore neither that thought I myself
[32:17] worthy to come unto thee but I say in a
[32:20] word and my servant shall be healed for
[32:23] I am also a man set under Authority
[32:26] having under me soldiers and I say unto
[32:29] you unto one go and he goeth into
[32:33] another come and he cometh and to my
[32:35] servants do this and he doeth it
[32:38] when Jesus heard these things he
[32:40] marveled at him and turned him about and
[32:43] said unto the people that followed him I
[32:45] say unto you I have not found so great
[32:48] faith no not in Israel and they were and
[32:51] they that were sent returning to the
[32:53] house found the servant whole that had
[32:56] been sick amen God bless the reading of
[32:59] this word you may be seated amen
[33:01] tonight I'd like to speak on a short
[33:03] little topic and I entitled it the power
[33:06] of your confession
[33:08] the power of your confession and this
[33:10] story is maybe a familiar story we heard
[33:12] a lot maybe in church and in our lives
[33:15] we heard this story a lot in where the
[33:17] Centurion he asked Jesus he had a
[33:19] servant that was sick he said he this
[33:22] Centurion came to a point that he
[33:24] realized that I'm not worthy for the
[33:27] presence of God to come into my home but
[33:30] if God would just speak the word if he
[33:32] could just speak the word then this
[33:34] sickness would be removed he doesn't
[33:37] even have to show up all he has to do is
[33:39] speak the word and I encourage you like
[33:41] it was a power that he confessed to
[33:43] himself you know I'm not worthy but the
[33:45] word that he speaks has power in it the
[33:48] word that God was going to speak had the
[33:50] power in it and it was going to be there
[33:52] was power in those words it was power
[33:55] because the person that spoke it
[33:57] believed Jesus believed that when he
[34:00] sent that word for as it said in his
[34:02] word his word can't return to him void
[34:04] so whatever he sent it out to do was
[34:06] going to accomplish what he sent it out
[34:08] to do amen and and see the Centurion he
[34:12] believed that the words of Jesus was
[34:14] going to heal his servant that whatever
[34:16] he spoke was going to happen whatever
[34:18] the Lord was going to speak unto him was
[34:21] going to happen he didn't doubt he he
[34:23] had so great faith Jesus even said I
[34:25] haven't found this great of faith in
[34:27] Israel his faith was so great he said
[34:29] you don't even have to come in my
[34:30] presence all you have to do is speak all
[34:34] you have to do is speak and when I
[34:36] implore you I was thinking about it and
[34:38] I and I remembered I said there was a
[34:41] God that created the heavens and the
[34:42] Earth but he didn't create it by forming
[34:45] it he created it by word he created it
[34:47] he spoke the word and it came into
[34:49] existence he spoke a word in in the
[34:52] worlds were created and I thought about
[34:54] it I said in in he says that we are Sons
[34:57] and Daughters of God if we are sons and
[35:00] daughters and God then he has given us
[35:02] the same power he has given us the same
[35:05] power to speak a word and to see things
[35:08] happen he has given us the same power to
[35:11] speak a word and see God move on the
[35:13] scene he is seeing God do the miraculous
[35:16] things by just the word with someone
[35:19] that believes in that word and don't
[35:20] doubt that it's true and it will come to
[35:22] pass as long as it's not contrary to the
[35:25] word of God as long as it doesn't
[35:27] contradict what he said here in the
[35:29] Bible so and if he says by his stripes
[35:32] we can heal we can speak the word and
[35:33] believe in it and it will happen
[35:35] if he said that I will deliver we can
[35:38] speak the word because he's already
[35:39] written the word all we have to do is
[35:41] speak it and believe and it shall happen
[35:44] because it can't return unto his his him
[35:47] void and that's what the Centurion he
[35:49] caught the Revelation that all I need is
[35:52] a word and to believe all I need is a
[35:55] word and to believe and everything will
[35:57] be all right and many of times I look at
[36:00] situations and I see him in life said
[36:02] all I need is a word and I think that's
[36:04] why God he he put their Bible so we can
[36:06] read it the prophet of God said if you
[36:09] want to grow closer to the Lord read
[36:10] your Bible and pray
[36:12] read your Bible and pray why why do you
[36:15] read your Bible so that you can gain
[36:17] inspiration why why why do you pray so
[36:20] that you can speak a word so that you
[36:22] can go to God in a word of prayer and
[36:24] you can get down and say Lord I need you
[36:26] Lord I need you to come down and fix my
[36:29] situation Lord I need your help Lord I
[36:33] need you to move in my life not in
[36:35] anybody else but my life see there's
[36:37] power when you get down on your knees
[36:39] and you and you get in contact with God
[36:41] and you know that there's something's
[36:43] going to happen whether you see it or
[36:45] don't see it you know to God as long as
[36:48] you continue to believe God is going to
[36:50] do something it may not be what you want
[36:52] him to do but it'll be exactly what he
[36:54] wanted he wants to happen it may not be
[36:57] it looked like the situation is getting
[36:58] worse but before the morning comes it
[37:01] gets the darkest before your blessings
[37:04] come the devil fights the hardest
[37:05] because he knows exactly where you're
[37:07] about to be but you got to continue
[37:09] believing and there's power in the word
[37:12] of God that's power and what he wants to
[37:14] give you see that Centurion to caught
[37:16] that Revelation he wasn't even a
[37:18] believer
[37:19] he wasn't even a church member he was a
[37:22] Roman Centurion in the army of the
[37:24] Romans but he caught a revelation that
[37:27] when God speak this word I can believe
[37:28] in it and there was power that was going
[37:31] to happen there was a power behind those
[37:33] words he didn't even have to be in my
[37:35] presence but I believe that this thing
[37:37] is going to happen and Proverbs it said
[37:39] there's death and life in the power of
[37:41] the tongue it's all in how you use it
[37:44] anything I even think about they say
[37:46] with technology nowadays you look at it
[37:49] and I say it's twofold it can be a
[37:51] blessing or it can be a hindrance
[37:54] it's all in how you use it and your
[37:56] words are the same way you can bless her
[37:58] you can curse
[38:00] you you can uplift or you can tear down
[38:03] but see there's power in the words that
[38:05] you use and you have to make sure that
[38:07] you're using your words the right way
[38:09] see there's a power in what you confess
[38:12] over your life
[38:13] because you can confess blessings or you
[38:15] can profess cursing you can do things by
[38:19] just the words that you say every single
[38:21] day and see there's power in it and see
[38:23] there's there was definitely life in the
[38:25] tongue in the power of the term But
[38:27] first you got to believe that the words
[38:29] that you are saying are true
[38:31] nothing can happen if you don't believe
[38:34] there's nothing that can mountains can't
[38:36] move if you don't believe you can speak
[38:38] at the mountain all you want but if you
[38:40] got doubts it won't ever move it won't
[38:43] ever move it's the slightest moment to
[38:45] God doubt I was listening to the prophet
[38:47] of God and he said there was this young
[38:49] lady she was in the prayer line and he
[38:51] said the Lord had gave him a revelation
[38:53] that she was healed she was walking on
[38:54] crutches and she came to him and she
[38:57] said
[38:58] and he said do you believe that that you
[39:01] that that you will be healed and she
[39:03] still had the crutches he said when you
[39:05] get to the end of the platform throw
[39:07] your crutches down and you'll be all
[39:09] right
[39:10] and she turned to him and she said but
[39:12] I've been on these crutches for so long
[39:14] and brother and the prophet of God said
[39:16] in that moment you missed it
[39:18] it was just that simple you miss it the
[39:21] power and the words were spoken but you
[39:23] missed it because you didn't believe
[39:25] said another lady came behind her and
[39:27] the brothers she was on crutches as well
[39:29] but the brothers they were carrying her
[39:32] and she might have been more ill than
[39:34] the other sister but she came to the
[39:36] exact same moments and the Lord blessed
[39:39] bless the prophet of God and she he got
[39:42] a revelation he said Do you believe and
[39:44] she said I have no choice but to believe
[39:47] and she and she got to the end and he
[39:49] said when you get to the end of this
[39:50] platform throw your crutches down and
[39:52] you'll be healed and she got to the end
[39:54] of that platform and she took off and
[39:57] she was completely healed see it was
[40:00] that simple the pop the words were there
[40:01] the power was in the words and the
[40:03] healing was there
[40:05] but one doubted and one believed
[40:08] see there was power in the words and one
[40:10] doubted and one believed that that one
[40:13] was going to be healed the other one
[40:15] doubted and said which one are you
[40:18] when you come to the moment and a word
[40:19] is spoken to you what you should do
[40:22] where you should go what should what
[40:25] should you believe in what do you do
[40:27] you question it or do you just go on and
[40:30] believe it
[40:31] do you just move on see there's there's
[40:34] power in the words that are spoken and
[40:37] said and the Bible says faith without
[40:39] works is dead see there's some action
[40:41] that has to happen once you believe
[40:44] you must go on you can't you can't
[40:47] believe and then go back and wallow in
[40:49] what you were in you can't believe and
[40:51] say I trust God but then go back to
[40:54] worrying about the situation you can't
[40:56] go back and say and say well and start
[40:59] thinking I don't know how it's going to
[41:00] happen but you see you got to move on
[41:02] and step forward and say I don't know
[41:04] how but I know it's going to happen I
[41:06] know that these things are going to
[41:08] change because there's power in the word
[41:10] of God there's power in what I confess
[41:12] to God and and give it to him and say
[41:15] Lord this is yours however you deem to
[41:18] work it out is your is it's up to you
[41:21] but I know that you're going to work it
[41:22] out for my good I may can't see what's
[41:25] going to happen down the road but I know
[41:27] that you are the god that can work
[41:28] everything to the good and as he says
[41:32] see there's power and there's power in
[41:34] your confession he says in the scripture
[41:37] in Mark chapter 11 verse 23 he said
[41:39] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[41:41] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[41:43] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[41:45] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[41:47] shall believe that those things that he
[41:50] said shall come to pass he shall have
[41:52] whatever he says whatsoever he said
[41:55] see it's sometimes it's that simple
[41:59] it's that small thing and it doesn't
[42:01] take this Centurion may not have had the
[42:04] knowledge of all the Pharisees he may
[42:06] not have studied the Bible of all years
[42:08] and times that some have dedicated their
[42:11] whole life to but he called a revelation
[42:14] he caught a revelation there was power
[42:16] in the words that Jesus was saying and
[42:19] all I got to do is believe all I got to
[42:22] do is believe and trust him and and my
[42:24] servant will be healed my servant will
[42:27] be healed that's all I got to do and see
[42:29] there was power in those words there
[42:31] were power in any and he said that he
[42:34] said if you speak the word that the
[42:37] mountain be removed
[42:39] and shall believe that those things
[42:40] which he said shall come to pass
[42:43] he shall have whatever he says and
[42:46] sometimes you got to personalize it say
[42:47] I shall have whatever I say
[42:50] I should have whatever whatever I say
[42:53] whatever as long as it's not contrary to
[42:56] the word I shall have it because God
[42:58] promised it to me the god that created
[43:01] Heavens is Earth is the same God that's
[43:03] inside of me
[43:04] so why can't I have exactly what he has
[43:06] given to him
[43:07] if he said that you have dominion over
[43:10] the heavens and the Earth why not
[43:12] why why can't I speak those words and
[43:15] believe them to to be true
[43:18] because he's the god of God it's the
[43:20] same God if it wasn't the same God then
[43:23] the things wouldn't happen but he said
[43:24] I'm the same yesterday today and forever
[43:28] so if there was power in Jesus words
[43:30] what about you and I
[43:33] it was power in God's words what about
[43:35] you and I
[43:36] and do we expect the same things to
[43:39] happen that happened with Jesus
[43:42] or do we said and say that only happened
[43:44] to Jesus that can't happen to me
[43:46] or do we expect the same thing for God
[43:48] to move the same way he did for Jesus
[43:51] and I know he is he said that I'm the
[43:54] same God so it's not God that's the
[43:57] problem
[43:57] it can't be God that's the problem
[44:00] so it takes us examining ourself and say
[44:02] do I believe
[44:03] do I believe am I right with God is my
[44:06] life right
[44:07] it's am I am I living according to God's
[44:11] word if I am then these signs shall
[44:13] follow them that believe these signs
[44:16] shall follow them that I believe they
[44:17] shall cast out devils in my name see
[44:19] there's there's there's promises that
[44:21] God gave you to them not believe now
[44:24] them that believe in the power of the
[44:26] word that he gave you and all you had to
[44:28] do is speak the word
[44:30] and your will shall be done as Dr
[44:33] Jackson you sung the song He said all
[44:36] you have to do is speak the word and say
[44:38] that's all Jesus did when the devil came
[44:41] his way that's what he used to defeat
[44:43] the Devil the devil tempted him
[44:46] and say if the devil can tempt Jesus
[44:48] what about you and I
[44:50] but what do you use to defeat the Devil
[44:53] what do you use when you get to your
[44:55] trial in your tribulation what do you
[44:57] use to defeat the Devil do you use your
[44:59] words or do you use the words that he
[45:01] has given you to defeat the Devil Jesus
[45:04] wasn't looking for something new some
[45:06] new revelation Jesus was going back to
[45:08] the things that he was already said he
[45:11] said in the scripture
[45:12] he said thou shall not tempt the Lord
[45:14] thy God the scripture said he went back
[45:17] to the word of God because he knew there
[45:19] was power in that word there was power
[45:21] in what he was confession because God
[45:23] said I can if I speak my word it can't
[45:25] return unto me void and that was all he
[45:28] needed to defeat the Devil he didn't
[45:30] need nothing new he just needed the word
[45:32] of God he just needed a word that was
[45:35] already set before see there was power
[45:37] in it and he confessed it and professed
[45:39] the word of God and and he was and the
[45:42] devil left him alone
[45:44] because the devil can't do anything with
[45:46] the word of God even though he believes
[45:49] that he trembles because that word has
[45:52] so much power
[45:53] has so much power that even the greatest
[45:56] force that ever has been against God
[45:58] trembles
[46:00] at the word of God the greatest enemy of
[46:03] God trembles at the word of God and some
[46:06] people say it's just words on the page
[46:08] but there's power
[46:09] there's power in the word of God there's
[46:12] an anointing on the word of God there's
[46:14] a presence that comes when you when you
[46:16] bring the word of God into a situation
[46:18] you say Lord I trust your word I bring
[46:20] your word Lord you said when two or
[46:22] three are gathered in your name there
[46:23] I'm in the midst it's not us that's
[46:26] doing it it's him that's doing it it's
[46:27] him that's coming down and he and he
[46:29] said I'll vindicate his word to them not
[46:32] believe see you there's an important
[46:34] time when we got to believe that God is
[46:36] going to vindicate this word he's going
[46:38] to bring the word off the pages and we
[46:40] see it in life form we see him in our
[46:42] midst we see the Miracles the signs and
[46:45] the Oneness and God just doing
[46:46] miraculous things because he is God
[46:49] because he's still God and he's the same
[46:52] God that's been doing it all through
[46:53] history so why not now why not now
[46:56] where's the presence where's the
[46:58] anointing where's the God that I know he
[47:00] is the god that I've seen deliver the
[47:03] god that I've seen healed the god that
[47:05] I've seen set free where it's the same
[47:07] God I know he's here and know he's on
[47:10] the scene now I just want him to come in
[47:12] my midst and he may not come in anyone
[47:15] else but I want him in my life I want
[47:17] him on my job I want them in my home I
[47:20] want them in my room I want them
[47:22] everywhere that I go Lord I want your
[47:24] presence
[47:26] see there's so many people that may not
[47:28] want God's presence but I do I want them
[47:30] I want to believe Lord that you are the
[47:32] same God I know that you're the same God
[47:35] I want to see you do the Miracles I want
[47:37] to see you do the signs and wonders that
[47:39] I know that you are the god that's
[47:41] capable of doing exceedingly abundantly
[47:43] more than I can ask or think that's the
[47:46] same God that I know each and every day
[47:48] that's the god that wakes you up in the
[47:50] morning the god that allows you to go to
[47:52] sleep and still breathe all through the
[47:54] night that's the same God that make sure
[47:57] that you don't get in car accidents it's
[47:59] the same God that keeps you keeps you
[48:02] safe keeps you warm keeps you healthy
[48:04] keeps your progression every single day
[48:07] it's the same God
[48:10] said can I expect more of them yes I can
[48:13] because he can do more than what I'm
[48:15] expecting of him he can do more than I
[48:18] think about he can do exceedingly more
[48:20] than I limit with my mind that's the God
[48:22] that I know that's the god that works
[48:25] out things then when things that works
[48:27] out in the Unseen so there's so many
[48:29] things that God just blocks from around
[48:32] you like job there were so many things
[48:34] that the Lord was blocking the devil
[48:36] said you gotta hedge around him said
[48:38] Lord keep that hedge around me keep that
[48:41] hedge around me Lord and continue to
[48:44] protect me continue to Watch Over Me
[48:46] continue to bless me Lord continue to do
[48:49] what you want to do in my life see
[48:51] there's so much that I can look at and I
[48:53] may see Lord and all the things that may
[48:55] be going wrong but you don't know how
[48:57] much God may be blocking
[48:59] it could be a thousand times worse but
[49:01] God is still moving God is still
[49:03] delivering God is still setting free
[49:06] because that's the God that I serve
[49:08] that's the god that never said I'll
[49:10] never leave your nor forsake you I'll be
[49:12] with you always even to the ends of the
[49:14] Earth that's the God that I know see
[49:16] there's power in his word there's power
[49:19] and all I got to do is believe all I
[49:21] have to do is believe
[49:23] see
[49:25] see that's the God that I serve
[49:27] said the same God that created the
[49:30] heavens and the Earth is inside of me
[49:33] said the prophet of God said many people
[49:35] miss it because they don't know who they
[49:37] are
[49:37] they don't realize I'm a son and
[49:40] daughter of God and he's given me the
[49:42] same power he's given me the same
[49:45] anointing he's given me the same
[49:47] presence that was with Jesus he's given
[49:50] that to me when you have the Holy Ghost
[49:52] he's given that to you
[49:55] so so why are you struggling
[49:58] why are you suffering
[50:00] when God has given you the power to
[50:03] overcome
[50:04] when he's given you the power to
[50:06] overcome
[50:07] said maybe we take the wrong approach to
[50:10] what God can do
[50:11] maybe we don't expect God to do more
[50:14] than what we've expected now but it's
[50:17] time to take the limits off of God
[50:19] it's time to take the lid off of the jar
[50:22] and say Lord don't just fill my cup
[50:24] overflow Lord don't just fill me up to
[50:27] the top overflow Lord and overflow and
[50:30] let it run and run and run such a way
[50:32] that it blesses everyone around me not
[50:34] just me Lord but everyone Lord Jesus
[50:37] Lord I want to see everyone get to that
[50:40] level Lord sometimes the it says let the
[50:44] strong bear the infirmities of the weak
[50:46] and sometimes people aren't on that
[50:48] level they're not there but if you're in
[50:51] a seed if you're down there bringing
[50:54] them through it can bring them up to
[50:57] such a level then they catch it for
[50:59] themselves that they catch it for
[51:01] themselves that they can believe that
[51:03] there's power they can see according to
[51:05] what you believe in your faith
[51:08] in the word of God except when the
[51:11] inspiration of the holy spirit is here
[51:13] to inspire you remember God will make
[51:16] your body come unto you come into your
[51:19] confession
[51:20] if you say that you're a drunker then
[51:22] want to drink don't worry you'll soon be
[51:24] one if you say that you're a sinner and
[51:27] want to sin you'll be right into it but
[51:30] if you say that you're a Christian and
[51:32] believe it all along God will bring your
[51:35] testimony will bring you right into it
[51:37] if you believe in healing and believe
[51:40] that God has healed you confess it and
[51:43] God will make your body obey your
[51:45] confession but he is the high priest of
[51:47] your confession see whatever you want
[51:49] God to do
[51:51] whatever you want God to do in your life
[51:55] in the people around you all you have to
[51:57] do is believe in the power of God's word
[52:00] all you have to do is trust in the power
[52:02] of God words and that he said I cannot
[52:05] return no word back to me boy and must
[52:08] accomplish what I send it out there to
[52:10] do
[52:12] said your testimony will bring you right
[52:15] into it if you believe in healing and
[52:16] believe that God has healed you
[52:18] confession and God will make your body
[52:20] obey your confession but he's your the
[52:23] high priest of your confession sitting
[52:25] on the right hand of the father now with
[52:27] his own blood to make intercession for
[52:30] any confession upon anything that he
[52:33] died for see he died to Rich sin and
[52:37] sickness is the result of sin
[52:39] so he was wounded for our transgression
[52:42] and with his stripes we will heal
[52:44] remember that have faith don't waver and
[52:48] stand on it
[52:49] stand on the word of God stand on it and
[52:52] don't waver don't faint because it may
[52:55] not come when you want it but he's
[52:57] always on time he may not show up when
[52:59] he thought he was going to show up and
[53:01] the situation may look more perilous the
[53:04] longer it goes on but he's still on time
[53:06] he's still the god that said I'm the god
[53:09] to healeth all diseases I'm the God to
[53:12] heal us all sicknesses and said when he
[53:14] died on the cross 2000 years ago it was
[53:16] the god that he cured everything he
[53:19] cured everything every sickness diseases
[53:22] everything that you may go through every
[53:24] trial tribulation it was it was done
[53:27] away with by the blood of Jesus
[53:29] and there was a blood there was power in
[53:31] that blood and it reached from the
[53:33] highest mountain to the lowest Valley he
[53:36] said everyone was going to have an
[53:38] opportunity to know Jesus died
[53:41] see there was power in in that death in
[53:43] that Resurrection
[53:45] and see the the power that was there is
[53:47] the power if you had a holy ghost that
[53:50] can be in you each and every day when
[53:52] you wake up you said Lord you can change
[53:55] what may happen to you
[53:57] just by what you confess just by the
[54:00] power that you believe in God's word
[54:02] atmospheres and situations may change
[54:05] just because of your prayers
[54:08] I think about the situation that just
[54:10] happened recently about the young man
[54:12] that that collapsed on the football
[54:14] field and and I said you don't know what
[54:16] prayer was the one that reached God
[54:19] to save a life
[54:21] you don't know who's prayer see there
[54:23] was power in the words of prayer there
[54:26] was power when someone got down on their
[54:28] knees in the words and they confessed
[54:30] and they got down and said Lord help
[54:31] that young man
[54:33] if if you can just imagine
[54:36] if if one of those prayers what about
[54:38] your prayer
[54:40] what about what you carry what you every
[54:42] day what could it do if you intercede
[54:45] for one person
[54:46] if you got down on your need and prayed
[54:48] for one person and just imagine you
[54:51] don't know that maybe God got someone
[54:52] else praying for that same person
[54:54] because he know what they're going
[54:56] through he know that they need the power
[54:58] of prayer to keep them going you he and
[55:01] you may not know what your prayers May
[55:03] accomplish and you may never see it but
[55:06] God is maybe using you to keep some
[55:09] people going further than they are
[55:11] to keep some people going it was the
[55:13] power of your prayers the power of the
[55:15] words that you uplift to them so what
[55:17] can God do what can't he do
[55:20] he said he's laid the foundation and
[55:22] he's opened the ways see that's the
[55:24] power that God has that's the power that
[55:27] he has given you and I that we can speak
[55:29] worlds into existence we can change the
[55:32] course of things we can't change the
[55:34] course of things but we can speak and
[55:37] that'd be Joshua's he pointed to the son
[55:39] and said Son stand still
[55:42] that's the God that I serve that's the
[55:44] God that I know wakes you up every
[55:46] single morning that's the god that when
[55:48] the Devil comes to tempt you and try you
[55:51] it's the god that stops you from doing
[55:52] what the devil wants you to do it's the
[55:55] same God that speaks to you each and
[55:57] every day when you want to do the wrong
[55:59] thing and he says don't do it and you
[56:01] listen
[56:03] but you got to believe in the words
[56:05] that's being spoken to you you can go
[56:07] through life many times and just go
[56:09] through the motion but it ain't till you
[56:11] believe and catch the Revelation for
[56:12] yourself
[56:13] things may never change if you don't
[56:15] catch that Revelation if you don't get
[56:18] to understanding that lord it's you
[56:20] that's doing the work it's you that's
[56:23] going to do this thing not me not anyone
[56:26] around me not my father not my mother
[56:28] but lord it's you that's going to do
[56:30] this all I got to do is speak your word
[56:32] and believe that all things are are
[56:35] possible that everything that I ask for
[56:37] Lord it may not be what I want but it'll
[56:40] be exactly what you want me to have
[56:41] it'll be exactly what you that you want
[56:44] and you see fit for me to have because
[56:46] that's the God that I serve there's no
[56:49] mountain that's high enough that he
[56:50] can't bring low and no valley that he
[56:53] can't uplift and bring High because
[56:55] that's the god that has the power and
[56:57] the word that he has given us that we
[57:00] can defeat every demon and every devil
[57:02] that may come our way
[57:07] foreign
[57:16] amen the power of your confession
[57:19] you know we heard a word tonight amen
[57:22] you know that I was ministering on thy
[57:26] faith has saved thee
[57:28] and go go your way your faith made you
[57:30] whole
[57:31] or go your way you know your faith saved
[57:33] you your faith did that and that's what
[57:36] you know what we're looking at here
[57:37] tonight the power of your confession
[57:39] you know I was thinking I says that we
[57:42] need God more now than we ever needed
[57:45] them before
[57:46] because we face with things we've never
[57:48] seen before
[57:50] look like we come to pass in our
[57:52] Christian Journeys that we ain't been
[57:53] here yet
[57:54] and and demons attacking on every hand
[57:58] so we need God more now than we we
[58:01] needed him ever before
[58:03] we need that faith that confession I was
[58:06] sharing with my nephew the other day I
[58:09] said as you know
[58:10] the thing is when most time a lot of
[58:13] people read the Bible they just look at
[58:15] it as being stories
[58:17] stories that's red stories that's told I
[58:19] says but you see here where it says he
[58:22] was wounded for our transgressions
[58:24] and he was bruised for our iniquities
[58:25] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[58:28] him and with his stripes we are healed I
[58:32] says you know when Jesus was being
[58:34] whipped and they was taking that
[58:36] whatever they had and hitting them with
[58:38] it pulling that flesh out of them I says
[58:41] that you know that was for your healing
[58:43] I says but you got to have faith to
[58:46] believe it it's got to become more than
[58:49] just a story to you you know what what
[58:51] makes it become more than just a story
[58:53] to you and I when we have troubles and
[58:56] nobody can help us
[58:58] when we come like I was saying the other
[59:00] day to our ends with
[59:02] and we don't have no other options but
[59:04] to look up
[59:06] and say God you know I run out of
[59:08] options
[59:09] you know he should have been the first
[59:11] option but Lord I I'm just taking you at
[59:14] your word you know how many times we got
[59:16] down on our knees and and we just said
[59:19] Lord not nothing deep
[59:21] but Lord this is what your word promised
[59:25] God whatever the situation was Lord this
[59:28] is what you promised us in your word and
[59:31] God I need you to do what you said
[59:33] you'll do come on as God be God and
[59:36] where is all his miracles and you know
[59:39] God is still God today like I said we're
[59:41] going to need him we need him now more
[59:42] than anything
[59:44] faced with stuff you've never seen
[59:45] before never heard before
[59:48] and like I told somebody the other day I
[59:50] said it ain't over yet I says but at the
[59:53] first round knock you out
[59:55] or hit you that hard you ain't gonna
[59:57] make it out the second round that says
[59:59] but what it is is each round come we
[1:00:02] gonna get stronger
[1:00:03] how we gonna get stronger because that's
[1:00:05] the mode we're going to look to God
[1:00:07] that's tomorrow we're going to start
[1:00:09] looking to that unseen realm because the
[1:00:12] things that we're seeing failing us
[1:00:14] but what it is with faith you know Faith
[1:00:18] looks into that that invisible Realm and
[1:00:21] it sees the things that that what our
[1:00:23] eyes are looking at don't know nothing
[1:00:25] about and it brings things to pass you
[1:00:28] know that that normal wouldn't happen
[1:00:31] but that's what faith does but it starts
[1:00:34] you know I was looking at the other day
[1:00:36] it says faith without works is dead
[1:00:38] right you got faith but where's your
[1:00:41] Works where's your confession behind it
[1:00:43] come on I believe but but if you really
[1:00:46] believe there's no butts behind it I
[1:00:49] believe and that settles it God I take
[1:00:52] you at your word
[1:00:53] I believe you for what you said come on
[1:00:56] you know you can't you can't put that
[1:00:59] faith in somebody right but Faith cometh
[1:01:02] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[1:01:04] that that individual he said he'd have
[1:01:07] to near let him hear when they hear the
[1:01:09] word of God you know it's something the
[1:01:12] Holy Ghost uh gives them the ability to
[1:01:15] hear but when it when it comes through
[1:01:17] that channel they heard it it does
[1:01:19] something for them don't it you know I
[1:01:21] was saying the other day I says what the
[1:01:23] problem is I says that we in a battle
[1:01:26] we're fighting these unseen forces don't
[1:01:29] know what we Face we we ain't been here
[1:01:32] before I say it's but God gave us
[1:01:34] weapons to fight with
[1:01:36] but we don't use those weapons I see one
[1:01:38] of the greatest weapons we talk about
[1:01:40] love all the time I said but but prayer
[1:01:44] pulling down strongholds I says but we
[1:01:47] all say we know that that's the greatest
[1:01:48] weapon that'll move mountains but we
[1:01:51] don't ever even use it do it and why did
[1:01:54] the devil fight you so hard because he
[1:01:56] knows as a prophet of God was saying
[1:01:58] when the when the weakest Christian get
[1:02:00] down on their knees in prayer
[1:02:02] demons begin to tremble things begin to
[1:02:05] shake and he knows that so he gonna
[1:02:07] fight you real hard in that area he
[1:02:09] gonna fight you real real hard in that
[1:02:11] area because he don't want you to get in
[1:02:13] contact with God he don't want you to
[1:02:15] come on but I said you got to find a way
[1:02:18] like the Bible says pray without ceasing
[1:02:21] I found myself now into sitting in the
[1:02:23] car everywhere I go every little two
[1:02:26] three minute here or whatever praying
[1:02:27] calling somebody name it's like a
[1:02:29] brother Keller was saying tonight you
[1:02:31] don't know what prayer got through
[1:02:32] calling Name Lord help him Lord save
[1:02:35] them God deliver them Lord Heal them
[1:02:37] Lord make a way for them you find
[1:02:38] yourself doing that and they say you
[1:02:40] know what happens God begin to move you
[1:02:43] start to see little by little God is
[1:02:45] doing something you know what when we
[1:02:47] talk about faith and things like that no
[1:02:49] it's just all we heard that we we know
[1:02:52] that yes you hadn't caught the
[1:02:54] revelation of it yet
[1:02:55] you hadn't seen it because if you did
[1:02:58] you'd be in action
[1:02:59] come on
[1:03:00] it'll make you move because you'll look
[1:03:03] and say Lord I got a situation I got a
[1:03:06] need I got troubles I got problems and
[1:03:08] God I've seen what you did for them I
[1:03:11] seen what you said in your word God now
[1:03:13] I need it I need your help I need a
[1:03:16] miracle today Hallelujah and I believe
[1:03:19] that God will bring it you know y'all
[1:03:22] believe that tonight come on the power
[1:03:24] of your confession you know we got to
[1:03:26] start confessing right
[1:03:28] let our confession be right I was
[1:03:31] looking at that as uh uh in Jeremiah 33
[1:03:33] the other day and how the Lord was
[1:03:36] prophesied he was through Jeremiah about
[1:03:39] the Captivity and the people that are
[1:03:40] going astray but he's talking about how
[1:03:42] he was going to bring him back and he
[1:03:44] said I'm gonna bring a health and cure
[1:03:47] he said I'm a blessing
[1:03:48] I'm gonna restore him bring him back you
[1:03:51] know when they call upon me with all
[1:03:53] their hearts
[1:03:54] when they called out to me he said I'm
[1:03:56] gonna hear him
[1:03:57] you know got to hear you when you call
[1:04:00] out to him how many feel like calling
[1:04:02] out to him tonight
[1:04:04] oh Jesus what a word we heard tonight
[1:04:07] come on the power
[1:04:09] of your confession

[1:04:13] battles you've been through your faith
[1:04:16] did that
