that says i'm god i am that i am blessed not your word bless your people father in jesus wonderful name amen second timothy 2 15. we're talking about god knows this morning and we want you to think on the end time message of the end time messenger we're in the end time in other words we're in the end of time the end time and we're in the end of time are you hoping it says study that showed ourself a proven to god a workman need not to be ashamed rightly divine the word of truth thank god that god has given us the right dividing of the truth word of truth but sean profane in vain babylon for they will increase until more ungodliness i'll tell you what y'all read the 17th and we'll go all the way to the end and i'll i'll read the next verse and we'll go from there 17 church excuse me who concerned how many years in felidas who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some that's what is happening a lot of people faith has been overthrown because it's not how many years and felidius but there's other folks that have come to overthrow your faith spirits are here paul dealt with it in his day and we're dealing with it today he says 19th verse class nice if you if you name the name of christ you'll depart if you're not then i understand are you with me if you name the name of christ you depart from the nicu if you're not if not you you keep on in the nicotine but in the great house there are not only vessels of gold and of civil but also wood and earth some to honor and some to disarm the 21. but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the name on the lord out of a what 23. and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient 25. together and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will god bless you in this word you mean you see this morning i was looking into that and you know sometimes and i can understand peter said an account that the long-suffering of god is salvation god suffers with us a long time a long period of time and he could cut us off the moment we arrow the thing the minute we sin god could just cut us off the minute we try to do something that's not pleasing in his sight he could say boom and he does sometimes to some folk just to try to let you know watch out be careful because it could have been you are you with me so by the grace of god as we think on uh god knows in the 19th verse he says nevertheless the foundation of god stands sure amen it stands sure i mean you can anchor your faith in it you don't have to worry about this foundation the foundation is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone amen so the foundation is a shield foundation don't worry about it it'll stand the word of god will stand heaven and earth will pass away but the word don't stand it's sure are you with me so what happens amen um these things were happening in the church in ephesus i mean in the beginning and these things that were happening if we look at the for uh the first verse he was exhorting timothy he said thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard from me among many witnesses the same commit thou unto what faithful what did he make did he make a mistake and he said faithful women i said faithful man what did he mean okay so god the men should take headship but the men look like they're sitting back and the women got to come and run the house they got to run the church you got to run everything why because the men are laying by he said commit to faithful men praise god everybody want to step back and instruct men yeah i said lord faithful men faithful men not faithful to your job but faithful to the word of god committed to faithful men are you with me and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou unto what faithful men who are what who shall be able to what to teach others also now the faithful men are not the women are trying to teach the men because the men are not faithful men are looking to their moms to teach them because the dad is not there are you with me in the house in the church men look like they come of a can of a cat but the same commit to faithful men we're living in a time they lived in that day back there what about now the instruction is to commit it to faithful men but can you find faithful men men that's going to be dedicated to god you know sometimes the brothers think they're doing the pastor of favor they're doing the church of favor brothers we got to realize that god has committed the word of god you should be the leaders the head and not the tail are you with me the husband is the one the head of the wife are you with me so but they got to take their position in the word so headship just because a man is a a male figure don't mean that he's responsible are you with me we need to be able to be responsible and take on the responsibilities of headship but everybody passes this passage to that we're passing it so the women coming okay we got no choice the women got no choice so they take care handship and i said especially in the black house hole and sometimes we're without the male figure and sometimes so without the male figure the man almost respect the woman over the man so the young fellows they'll listen to a woman before they listen to a man because there was no male figure and sometimes it caused a perversion of the man you don't know how to be a man because he don't see a man but he knows how to be a woman and he thinks and you know this is the way i'm supposed to be it's time that brothers get in their position and be real men and it's time for the woman just to be in her position and to be a helpmate to love her husband and love her children let me see what i can do to help but how can she if the brothers laid back and don't want to lead many men especially in the black home they're not leaders and they don't want to leave and then you have those that want to lead but don't have the ability to leave we will not accept help so a lot of times things are always shipwrecked sometimes it comes responsibility for bills being paid and not paid struggling all the time why because then they'd want to be ahead but they don't know how to they did not see that or witnessed that in the home it's times when wives want to help but because this mentality i'm your head i'm the boss you cannot help but i want you to know that the holy ghost will teach you in a position to place you if you yield to the holy ghost the holy ghost will let a man be a man without having they call it male chauvinist we call it the nicolaitan spirit dominating you know what i'm saying it's all kind of things you can have but you can give respect and honor to your wife and to women without trying to put them as something that's of a lord species they call them all kind of names these young people that come up and if they listen these young people listen to the rap and all of that you know sometimes you know you'll be at a gas station or somewhere and they're calling women all kind of names and you're young people young men are listening to that so they won't know how to treat a young lady because they listen to that they get in the spirit to get a part of them they begin to say those same words they begin to rap with them and say those things i don't know let me that is that wasn't even a part of what i where i was going praise god why do men want to you know the bible says it's a shame for that woman to shave or cut her hair you know what i'm saying then he said if a man have a long hat don't you know what's ashamed to him you said it does not even nature itself teaches you you know what i'm saying you know women say they're tired of all this hair and men say i want it down my back are you with me so it's a spirit whatever the word go says the spirit of the devil said i'll make you bow to me the devil is responsible for trying to make men become women and women become men so the whole thing is out of white out of course so we'll we're living in a world that's turned upside down it's sad it's sad how we going to face god but god is long-suffering let me go ahead hold i don't know how i got into those things but it's something that's happening it's something happening to our young men and they don't seem to understand what's happening to the black men i had one of the leaders of the city come to me and he asked me a question and my wife was with me so would you teach will you come and teach you wanted to bring the preachers together and realized that the trouble that was in the black community and asked me will you come and teach because we're dealing with spiritual problems we're dealing with demons and devils will you come and teach he had the power to bring the preachers to pastors together and he was calling the big names the big churches and he wanted me to teach them i said no bruh not me because he wanted to deal with casting out devils can we pray and cast out devils you know if you got a devil and you don't want that devil to go minister can pray for you cast that devil out don't you know that devil coming back with seven knows the devil is worse than himself because you don't want to leave that kind of lifestyle if you don't want to leave that lifestyle the devil will come back so it's no use in casting the devil out when the people don't want the devil out but he was spiritual enough to understand that it's a spiritual problem in the black community it's a spiritual problem and the only way we're going to get it right we got to get with god in a real weight i wanna i mean you and god he talking to you you and god you're coming on one accord with god and i'm saying you got to get regard in a personal way if you don't know god personally as an individual i'm telling you don't look for the church to be god for you you got to know god for yourself not a god and thank you no god you know i'm talking about the only true and living god the lord jesus christ without a personal experience with god without god speaking to your heart then sometimes we feel like the church failed us sometimes we feel like the preachers feel but you let's look to god god never fails cannot fail you maybe you looking up to to something else but god i if if you want god nothing should hinder you if you get on your knee most of a lot of us when god talked to us it wasn't because we were in a church somewhere and god constantly deal with you day by day and wherever where you go until god until you start listening until you were willing to surrender to him dealing with you it didn't take much somebody to invite you to church and say this or that because you it was god already dealing with you so let me just go to the third verse i got to get get off the young men but yeah men men that want to be men it's not crabs in the bucket you know somebody tried to get up and you trying to pull them down every time somebody tried to get ups why this and why that vain babbling let's say something nice lift them up let's lift one another up you know i you know it comes to church all he said a brother sister be a fornicator don't keep no company with them we don't even know what that means no more a person can be a fornicator and we can keep company oh that's my they're not wrong with sin no more because why the bible don't mean a thing because we don't read it are you with me you got to treasure this word if i don't teach it and i don't preach it you know then i'm gonna be responsible to god when i face god i'm gonna have to get accountable to god you might say brother simmons throwing off brother simmons saying that's versus seven saying that but i gotta give account to god are you with me we're not supposed to be men pleasers we don't want you to feel satisfied and happy sinning we want you to feel condemned when you do wrong are you with me we want you to feel condemned enough to confess your sins and forsake them to repent but when you feel comfortable sinning and ain't nothing wrong with it and people treat you like they they ought to say hey brother and sister i don't mean no harm if you're not going to get right i can't keep up me with you well that's my cousin that's my this one that i can't keep company with you if you're not gonna do right are you with me now for a sinner that's all right but if a brother or sister is doing wrong that's different you got people that's in the world they're just sinners they're blocking you know sin and sin they're out there but we want those that call that are called by the name of christ to depart from iniquity we want them to live right do right and do the right thing you know a lot of them know sinners out there a lot of them don't know they don't have that experience they don't know what they do but you don't know the truth and know what's right you see what i'm saying it's a difference and we find people you know rare up in the church and they they do certain things and and it's almost like hey what's going on here it shouldn't be the preacher addressing it it shouldn't be that it has to come across a pulpit but we know what cain said am i my brother what do you love your brother do you love your sister are you with me if you love him love is what correcting if you love them you ought to be willing to correct them but when what when a person repent you ought to what forgive them because you want everybody to make it but we don't want people just to continually descend but if they repent 70 times 70 we want to what forgive them and go on are you with me forgive be quick to forgive because god got to forgive you too because you ain't so you know i you know i'm not declaring myself to be so righteous and so good each and every one of us need god forgiveness every day are you with me but we ought to be wise enough that we won't it's okay let me go on thou therefore endure hardness as a what there's a good soldier of christ i'm talking he said i'm a soldier praise god i'm a soldier oh god this is too loud i'm so genuine army of the lord oh still too loud rebounding rebounding soulja now of the lord amen he says can y'all hear all right okay he said die therefore in doing hardness is a good soldier hardness is a good soldier i'll tell you i think i was talking to my wife and we were talking about what saints of old went through saints at home over kill they died they went through some stuff and do hardness as a good soldier man the thing that we are worried about it ain't worth they were in lion dens they were head chopped off they went through prison and all of that for the word of god saying and we you man you let the devil get around and stir up something and everybody you're looking at one another that ain't nothing that ain't nothing brothers and sisters that stuff the devil have you all worried about man that ain't nothing we got to get ready i think rachel was telling me this morning that they got another virus coming out and that is it kills faster or whatever than the virus so what we into brothers and sisters we got to get ready to be strong in the lord all of that interference you know i was telling the brother this morning i said brother you know he's telling me about something i said brother i want you to keep focused we're in an hour now and you got to look at the cross we had a time now that we all of us got to get closer to the lord i said the thing is you see things it causes you to get on your knees and pray about it give it to the lord don't let nothing take your focus now we got to get closer to the lord right now we're in a time a dangerous time if these diseases and these plaques keep coming you're going to need god one shot you're going to get tired of shots you need god are you with me brother and sister don't you know if these things keep on happening we gonna have to have god amen you have a little temporary relief and people get a little comfortable then there's another one has another one oh what god is just saying come on come on get focused yeah i mean all the other stuff that the devil tried to distract you try to get your attention keep your eyes on the cross we got to get out of here keep your eyes on the cross keep your eyes on jesus don't call don't let nothing cause you not to love one another with all of your heart amen praise god don't let nothing cause any kind of bitterness you got to have perfect love and you got to get down praise god don't let the devil distract you hey it doesn't matter what folks say or think that don't matter forgive and go on but if you can't do it now the foundation of god stands to sure are you with me don't you believe it's going to be somebody god got somebody some vessels of gold some are civil he got some wood that's going to be burned in the church you've got all kinds of vessels are you with me but those that are of gold got to peel hard and they shall see god are you a man don't worry about the thing you won't miss it brother sister just keep your heart peeled amen tell you another thing you can't fool god you ain't a fool god none of us i know i know them they ain't fooling me but i'ma tell you don't worry about them fooling you they can't fool god anyway are you with me praise god you can think you know me but you don't know me you just thank you you perceive that you know me oh i know him [Music] praise god but there's a lot that you don't know about me and there's a lot that i don't know about you are you with me because you know if i knew everything about you i'll be god are you with me because god knows it all and i don't know all are you with me so what i'm saying to you the the things that you think you know forget about that but the thing is to know him amen that's what you that's who you want to know god and to know him is love praise god that and that that love that god it gives you to know him is life and to know if you have a life then you have the love of god in you but god is love isn't that right so that's what it takes you to another focus you focus your attention on do i have the peace do i have the joy do i have the love of god in my heart i can rest assured knowing that there's no envy no jealousy no malice no nothing in me and there's no manipulation there's no stuff that i'm trying to do amen praise god i want you to make it i want to make it i want you to make it we all got to make this journey amen we're on our way to heaven praise god and if you want you know we can we can receive the word or we can critique it and try to find out why are you saying what you're saying what i'm i i'm critiquing it i'm sitting here and i'm trying to find out what is he talking about why he said that why you said this what is your reasoning amen but become faith come by and hearing by the way that's what we got to do we got to come with a mind god i need you i speak to my heart lord if you can say something amen because god i want to be closer to you that's what we have that's what we are we're getting somewhere now because it's all about you know praise god use him speak through him it doesn't matter who it is preaching whether his brother simmons whether his brother earnest was it whoever it is lord speak to me i need help i need you lord i want to draw closer to search me oh god that's what we want he says no man that wards entangles himself with the fads or what the affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier god chose you to be a soldier not the church not brother simmons your person your relationship is with god your walk is with god and the bible teaches us to obey them to help rule over you for they watch for your soul and god to give a count for you you know what i believe we they overdid it when i was back in in the church that i came up with but we under do it we don't obey them to have a rule over us we just do what we want nobody gonna tell me nothing you know obey them because they watch for your soul must give account for you i believe that they don't think that god has an order as many think god doesn't have an order he's got to obey them to have a rule over you for the watch for your soul got to give a count for you he said wait what are you doing brother i'm doing this what are you doing sister don't know nobody i i i i know god for myself there's no fivefold ministry gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the what perfection of the saints so god put these officers in the church and the prophet god said if you don't respect the man respect the office are you with me and in in respect in the office you're going to respect the person are you with me so it's it's a matter of understanding god's economy amen a lot of times pastors struggle they struggle with people understanding amen their position if a pastor that's a godly pastor he would far rather be setting in the pews than to be passionate a people if he's a godly pastor he would fall and he would 100 percent rather be sitting in the pews but by the grace of god he said i am what i am praise god let's give the lord a hand clap for brother frank coming in amen they've come a long way amen i'll tell you something you get a chance to praise the lord praise the lord they come a long way praise god i thank god for him now i got to go on doctor but i saw certain things here in this chapter and i'm talking about end time every messenger that ever came on the scene the bible says in amos three seven shooters of the lord god would do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servant the prophet in every age god addressed the angel of the church the messenger for that age in the early church paul was a messenger angel to the church and god didn't come directly to the church he said to the angel of the church he said i want you to know i said god knows let me let me go to revelation quick and i'll try to finish a god god knows revelation um two and two it says i know thy works the thou of labor and not label and patience and how thou cannot bear them with your evil are you with me and thou has tried them which say their apostles and are not and have found them to be what liars and then and has bored and has patience and and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have what because what you know every age is a is a conglomeration or all come together in the last age are you with me like the horse riders the white the red the black and all the horse riders come together in the last horse ride of the pail because you put the colors together until all the church ages come together at the end because what he said the word of god is the same yesterday and the day and forever so what i want to say he said i know god knows god knew then and god knows now are you with me he said nevertheless i have someone against you because what first love your first love is jesus christ and don't you ever leave him your first love is the word of god don't you ever leave it praise god sometimes people such and do what the prophet said oh i'm touching them no search the bible for he said search instructions for your name you think you have eternal life for daily testify of me nothing can be added to this bible nothing can be taken away from this bible somebody said well uh no not the bible plus something else the bible is your absolute you must take everything through the urine throne but i think we got it all right the bible is the absolute are you with me and the messenger can only say what's already here in every age it's got to be what's already written but there's a responsibility for each age each age has their problems and their difficulty in what they're going through and it's identified so the angel of the church ex and must uh he must address the sins of that age and the condition of that age to get the people back to where they need to be back to the word are you with me so it's all in bringing you back not to him but back to the word okay so as we move from that age ephesus he said they left their first love what about you do you love god the way you loved him when you got saved do you love him like that or other things is blocking you other things hinder you how's your relationship with god you know when you when you when you can first get saved you don't see no nobody you don't think about it you don't think about your trouble it's just lord i love you it's all about god i thank god for uh you know a sister uh sister mack amen thank god she says she said to me she said i don't know what this is it was like electricity in my box and she you know she stayed there in the pool and she stayed there for maybe 30 45 minutes just with the power of god all over her and then when she come out she says i never felt this way this it's like electricity i said that's the holy ghost sister mike is that right amen thank the lord thank the lord for sister man you know and there's something about you experiencing that and it produces love you just love everybody you just say oh god everything is wonderful lovely see that's what he's talking uh don't don't let nothing interfere with the love that you have for god and the zeal you have for god when things happen don't just let that go because it's not worth it nothing taking your love away and your passion for god and your passion for to see others experience what you experience in your life the love of god and what salvation means what god means to you don't let nothing you know well you cannot witness to nobody because you're going through all what folks say what folks think and you can't even witness to know somebody about the love of god because you don't have it are you with me you don't have the peace of god in you how can you bring somebody for to something that you don't have yourself you need to have it what you can witness to somebody okay so let me go on to the next the sperm age in nine and ten verse nine revelation two nine and ten it says i know thy works tribulation poverty but thou are rich you see all of us you're poverty but you're rich see god said i know but i want to tell you you're rich i know you're poverty but you're rich you see you understand don't worry about it god knows what what we go through we act like god is what you think god sees everything he knows everything he knows what we're going through we know all our problems but why we all oh let god don't know you're worried about something that god already says i already took care of that i took care of all your sins all your nicknames i i died for that matter of fact amen what you should have is righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost that's what you should have because i know all i know about all of that and i want none of those things to defuse you to take your power away amen i want you to keep on pressing the battle are you with me keep on hold stay in the love of god i know the blasphemy of them that say they're jews you know and are not but they are the synagogue and the satan it's a lot of fool but don't you worry about that he said i know that nevertheless the foundation of god's standing ashore having this sealed the lord what he knows he knows them that are his are you with me so don't you worry ah like god can't see god no but he's long suffering and paul tells us to be long suffering with one another and in second timothy that paul is saying to you amen that god can prevent you save that person that's going out of the way don't don't just do them any kind of way because god can bring them back okay he says here he says fear none of those things which thou shall what i thought these things well they were killed they they were actually killed they went through some stuff i don't understand there's something wrong with this age here the the time we're living in and you listen to no matter how much you preach how much you teach people for the same like is dull of hearing they like they don't i'm going through and the things that they spend their conversation on all the negative stuff they all the stuff they went to all the stuff they've been through all the stuff they're going through oh somebody's trying to take my uh uh joy wait somebody trying to take my oh ain't nobody trying to take your husband nobody trying to take your wife somebody talking about my children you don't say that ain't nothing that i'm tall are you with me praise god that's always gonna be that way amen in the world you're gonna have but be of good cheer because i what overcome the world amen you're gonna go through some things amen you're gonna be misunderstood i'll be misunderstood we ought to be misunderstood amen people are misunderst they think you've got something against them when you love them they'll thank you are you with me so you'll never be able to explain to a person that you love them when they think you've got some against them you'll never be able to do anything that they're satisfied with long as they think in their mind they got something against him i remember a bishop used to he he gave me some solid sound advice but it's been other preachers told me don't listen to that bishop don't listen to them songs on song but when i got older i thought that bishop gave me sound as a young man he gave me sound solid good advice better than all those other voices i was listening to he gave me the best advice and you know because you because i had heard this and heard that i didn't listen to him but when i got old i said you know and when i would see him i said thank you i asked him please forgive me he said that's all right that's all right you know what i'm saying because some sometimes the per you when you get a little older you'll understand it better buying by sometimes you can be blurred and you could be misunderstood or whatever because an advice you can give is not taken why because somebody went before you the spirit and said something they shouldn't say are you with me he said fear none of those things you should suffer behold the devil shall what cast some of you in what brother brother and sister i'm hoping we'll be gone before that happen are you with me i'm hoping we'll be gone because we need if if another plague hit as as as rachel was saying if another plague hit like until corona and another one and i i think i i might as well just i don't know just get on my knees and get in the car and just start praying god i want to make sure i got it i want to make sure i got it right and i i'm at that point i said lord i i want to tell you people just keep your eyes focused on jesus nothing else in his life nothing that's in his word gonna matter just keep your eyes focused on jesus amen anything else but jesus i'm gonna tell you something it won't matter after a while republicans against democrats and you know this one fighting against that one and then all of a sudden the economy the whole thing crashed the whole miracle become bankrupt and you know what'll happen you know who's going to bail him out are you with me the servant the borrower the servant to the lender we're right at that point where all your money could go and one day all they got to do is not pass this deficit thing everything go crashing boom all that oh my years it don't mean nothing everything is gone at the moment just like the whole world was paralyzed with this corona the bank system boom gone dip hit worse than the great depression all your money everything that you save everything that you thought you wanted it's gone just like that let them keep fussing nobody seemed to can get together the natural types of spiritual nobody seemed to be able to come together there used to be a time when they would just say well let's let's just compromise and let's just try to work this thing out now i don't care what you're saying i still ain't gonna shake your hand i still i still know you i still know you the devil you know well that's brother forgive me sister forgive me oh they just saying something you know what i'm saying and then they said let's let's compromise well i'll meet you this way me too i ain't i'm i'm staying right where i'm staying and and i'm gonna stay right right here i'm staying we can you can do something try republicans you do what we say or we ain't gonna move democrats we want this and we want that same thing going on in the natural going on in the spirit in the church folks want this and i ain't been i ain't gonna forgive you they don't say it like that i forgive you but you know you know i i forgave them but you keep your eyes on them because they ain't right you might as well not forgive them you can still talk about they ain't right you know what i'm saying brother and sister it's time to go to heaven it's time to put all the foolishness out of our hearts and focus on jesus christ are you with me going home time thank you caleb let me go don't skip over and go to laodicea he said i know okay 3 and 15. revelation 3 15. he said i know thou what i know your works you know i know you're not hot or cold now you might say you ain't talking to me because i'm i'm hot see god addresses this age he said i know your works that you're neither hot nor cold he said because you're lukewarm hey are you with me he said i wonder that you were hot or cold because lukewarm i spilled you out of my mouth isn't that right so god looks at the condition of this age the people in this age they want to be lukewarm they want to be in the church and in the world at the same time they want to love god and love the world at the same time not hot not cold they ain't on fire for god but they ain't fully serving the devil either look like the devil all the hatred the devil don't mind that but god god would you harder cold amen but the devil don't mind you being lukewarm and i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister we need to get on fire again we need to get on fire again and whatever it takes for you to get on fire again it's between you and god as individuals don't let nobody stop you nobody should hinder you and your walk with god nothing that anybody say nothing anybody do for you your walk with god is an individual journey you got to get in your own closet you got to get in your own place secret place and call upon god to something happen to you and god don't let me focus on nothing let me empty out let me tell you about and god let me just get to that place where it's just me and you i ain't gonna if i don't make it ain't gonna be nobody fault but mine if i don't make it to helm and i'm gonna put it on the church i ain't gonna put it on the preacher i'm gonna put it on mama daddy nobody it's gonna be me and god my relationship with god until i get down to business and focus i'm going to tell you something have you ever been filled with the holy ghost that's the way you got it you got it when you surrender it all you got it when you nothing in this world matters you was willing to give it up praise god amen you didn't get the holy ghost until you surrendered until you surrendered all to god and said lord whatever you want me to do whatever your will is for my life then that's when he came in and if you got in any other kind of way i doubt you got it are you with me and if you hadn't surrendered all the time that you surrender all it's time that you let god have his way in your life are you with me thanks it's going home time as i said it's dark out there i don't know how much more we can stand if we make it through this year here they don't pass that little bill that we can make it to the physical year and they fuss in there cuz you told the republicans they shouldn't never give in the thing that if they were to hell out like that they said we went to poo the whole market everything would crash if it happened what then brother sister if that happened would that get our attention would it take something like that to happen to realize that your job don't mean nothing your money don't mean nothing everything you work and labor
