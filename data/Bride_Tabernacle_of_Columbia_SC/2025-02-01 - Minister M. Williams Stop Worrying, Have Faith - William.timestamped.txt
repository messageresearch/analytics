[25:15] time that we're living in amen it
[25:17] requires a certain amount of Faith amen

[25:26] understand what we have have need of and
[25:29] those things can be provided for us amen
[25:32] let's just read it to you Luke
[25:34] 18:1 and it says he spake a parable unto
[25:39] them to this end that men ought to
[25:42] always to pray amen and not to
[25:47] faint make that personal to yourself
[25:49] tonight amen amen and what he does he
[25:51] tells a story to to get this example

[26:01] feared not
[26:03] God neither regarded man and there was a
[26:07] widow in that City and she came unto him
[26:10] saying avenge me of my
[26:14] adversary and he would not for a while
[26:17] but afterward he said within himself
[26:20] though I fear not God nor regard man yet
[26:26] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[26:31] avenge her lest by her continual coming
[26:35] she worry me y'all understand what he
[26:38] trying to say he ain't really care so
[26:39] much what was going on but it's like she
[26:41] was just so uh uh aggravating she just
[26:44] kept coming with a knee and coming with
[26:46] a knee and coming with a knee and he
[26:47] said you know what let me go and take
[26:50] care of this thing amen
[26:53] amen the sixth verse reads and the Lord
[26:56] said hear what the UN just judge

[34:44] sometimes our faith oh God is a little
[34:47] faith amen praise God Saints we living

[34:52] just have little faith amen but you
[34:54] going to need some big Faith am you
[34:57] going to need strong faith amen you
[34:59] going to need some faith that when the

[35:17] much that sometimes we don't have no
[35:18] faith but sometimes our faith can be L
[35:21] up amen how do we strengthen our faith
[35:25] Paul tells us faith comes by hearing
[35:27] amen you got to come out to the service
[35:30] amen you got to hear what the word of
[35:33] God is saying to you you got to study
[35:35] your scripture amen you got to talk back
[35:38] to God we think it's some high and deep
[35:41] things but sometimes it's just as simple
[35:43] as coming out the church amen
[35:46] amen amen bless it's different levels of
[35:50] Faith
[35:51] amen the scripture tells us you can
[35:54] actually have a gift of faith amen we
[35:56] got a sister in our church she got a
[35:58] gift of faith and if you got a little
[36:00] bit of Doubt Within You by the time that
[36:01] sister start talking to you and dealing
[36:03] with that issue amen your faith get
[36:05] pretty strong amen cuz that's the gift
[36:07] of faith and sometimes we think our
[36:09] faith got to be so big the Lord said all
[36:12] you got to do is have it as a size of a
[36:15] mustard seed amen and you would think
[36:17] that would qualifies little faith but
[36:19] almighty God said that would be big
[36:22] Faith praise
[36:25] God Saints we living in a time period
[36:29] amen where the Bible says that it will
[36:32] be hard for people to have
[36:35] faith when we were reading in Luke 18
[36:38] amen when it gets about to the eth verse
[36:41] he says nevertheless when the son of man
[36:43] come shall he find Faith
[36:48] amen amen amen amen he may be able to
[36:51] find nice churches he may be able to
[36:54] find good people amen he may be able to
[36:57] find great
[36:59] musicians but what the word of God is
[37:02] saying when he come when the son of man
[37:04] come y'all understand the son of man
[37:05] deals with the end time amen it deals
[37:08] with the word being made flesh again
[37:10] amen almighty God walking around in
[37:12] human flesh amen glory to God he's
[37:14] manifesting himself in your flesh and at
[37:17] that point in time when it gets down to
[37:19] the End Amen will he be able to find
[37:23] Faith amen praise God Amen the thing
[37:26] about Luke 18 amen it it it runs from
[37:29] Luke 17 and we very familiar with Luke
[37:32] 17 amen it deals with the son of man
[37:34] amen it it deals with the time period of
[37:36] the end amen amen in Luke 17 what
[37:38] happens is it starts to prophesy Jesus
[37:41] starts to prophesy and lets us know what
[37:43] will be going on at the end time amen he
[37:46] starts to talk about uh as it was in the
[37:49] days a lot amen praise God we very
[37:51] familiar with that today's a lot we know
[37:53] homosexuality was running rampants amen
[37:56] glory to God unless youve been living
[37:57] underneath a rock you know that
[38:00] homosexuality is running rampid amen
[38:03] then he said as it was in the days of of
[38:05] Noah amen as it was in the days of lot
[38:08] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[38:09] of man as it was in the days of Noah so
[38:12] shall it be at the coming of the son of
[38:14] man you can go back to the beginning of
[38:16] the Bible and it will show you exactly
[38:18] what was happening in the days of lot it
[38:21] will show you exactly what was happening
[38:22] in the days of Noah the scripture says
[38:25] in Genesis the 6th chapter and 11 verse
[38:28] that the Earth was corrupt before God
[38:31] and it was filled with violence now to
[38:33] me that sounds a lot like the time
[38:35] period that we're living in that the
[38:38] Earth was corrupt before God Amen and
[38:41] the Earth itself was filled with
[38:43] violence amen
[38:45] amen amen amen I was in the barber shop
[38:49] on Tuesday man it was talking about a
[38:51] shooting that happened on Far road and
[38:53] it sound like it was a family
[38:55] argument hope I don't know if y'all know
[38:57] him or don't know him amen but he was 50
[39:00] years old and I said man to live 50
[39:03] years on this Earth and to be killed by
[39:06] a family member over something that was
[39:09] probably a very simple argument but the
[39:12] Bible says that in the last days the
[39:15] Earth would be filled with violence
[39:18] amen Luke 17 talks about they were
[39:21] planting and building amen it was a a
[39:24] time of eating and drinking we see all
[39:26] those things amen
[39:28] if you want to order you some food right
[39:30] now and to be waiting on you when you
[39:31] get out of church they'll bring it to
[39:33] you amen don't matter if it's Pizza
[39:35] don't matter if you want to get
[39:36] something from the barbecue place they
[39:37] can bring it to you with door Dash amen
[39:39] according to God we see how they build a
[39:42] subdivision and when you think they
[39:44] can't squeeze no more houses in that
[39:45] subdivision cuz they put the houses
[39:47] right next to each other they make a
[39:49] whole new section and squeeze some more
[39:51] houses and the Bible says it would be a
[39:54] time of great building amen amen yes is
[39:57] telling you things about Luke 17 Luke 17
[39:59] deals with Lot's wife amen and how when
[40:02] they was making their escape out of the
[40:04] city amen that she just something with
[40:07] finner that she just want to hold on to
[40:09] a few things of the world right at the
[40:12] time when they was making their escape
[40:14] amen and it became a great example so
[40:17] much that Jesus said remember Lot's wife
[40:20] amen I'm bringing you to this time
[40:22] period now GL to God Luke 17 it deals
[40:25] with it be two in the bed one taken and
[40:28] one left two in the field one taken and
[40:30] one left two on the job one taken and
[40:33] one left praise
[40:36] God and in the midst of all of this
[40:39] going on Amen Luke 17 starts to roll
[40:43] into Luke 18 that's right and Jesus is
[40:45] giv us all of these pictures of things
[40:48] that will be happening at the end time
[40:50] and right when you will start worrying
[40:53] he gives us a parable he gives us a
[40:56] story that will cause us to be able to
[40:59] strengthen our faith GL to God amen amen
[41:02] Saints if you got weak
[41:05] Faith the devil is going to manhandle
[41:08] you all type of ways glory to God Amen
[41:11] but there's something that you need to
[41:14] do and it's as simple as p r a
[41:20] y sometimes we think men out to always
[41:23] eat no that's not what the Bible says
[41:25] sometimes we think that men out to
[41:26] always
[41:27] a woman out to always fuss amen glory to
[41:30] God that's not what the Bible is talking
[41:32] about amen it says that men and when it
[41:35] say men in this case sisters he's
[41:37] talking about you as well the thing that
[41:39] you need to do you don't always need to
[41:41] be on Facebook you don't always need to
[41:43] be trying to find something to eat you
[41:45] don't always need to be ordering
[41:46] something from Amazon all the time hello
[41:48] somebody but you got to be able to
[41:51] always pray glory to God and not
[41:55] faint the reason why phrase it like that
[41:58] brother Ernest is because we're going to
[42:00] run into things saints that will make
[42:02] you want to faint Hallelujah GL to God
[42:06] but prayer is the key your faith is
[42:09] going to unlock the door amen praise
[42:12] God the time where you start to feel
[42:15] faint the time where problem on top of
[42:18] problem is piling up that is the time
[42:22] that you ought to always pray
[42:25] understanding that God is the pray
[42:27] of his
[42:30] [Applause]
[42:31] people in a time where the world want
[42:34] you to worry about this and worry about
[42:37] that they had a plane crash the other
[42:39] day and have you worried to get on the
[42:40] airplane right now amen but we don't
[42:43] have to worry about so much men out to
[42:46] always pray we talking to the Believers
[42:48] tonight you out to always pray amen sir
[42:52] and not faint amen amen amen yes Lord
[42:57] cuz at the end time it would be things
[42:58] that would make people want to faint
[43:02] amen the Lord said at the end time it
[43:05] will be even hard to find faith on the
[43:08] earth that's right amen nevertheless
[43:10] when a son of man come up can he find
[43:11] faith on the earth amen you know the
[43:14] reason why it's so hard to find faith is
[43:17] because this world is in a condition
[43:19] called lay of the sea amen and what Le
[43:21] de seia does is it it Waters everything
[43:24] down and it makes things lukewarm amen
[43:27] it makes things gentle and it causes
[43:29] people to be blind to spiritual things
[43:32] it causes people to be naked to
[43:34] spiritual things amen it causes people
[43:37] not to be able to purchase say I I give
[43:39] you gold amen glory to God so that you
[43:42] could purchase the right thing amen what
[43:44] happens Le the sea will beat the people
[43:47] up so
[43:48] badly that your faith amen the Lord said
[43:51] when I come back would I even be able to
[43:54] find faith
[43:57] to be able to believe in the Unseen
[43:59] thing in a different realm amen the
[44:02] substance of the things hoped for the
[44:04] evidence of the Things Not Seen will I
[44:06] be able to find Faith amen
[44:10] amen and Jesus said it's a simple as
[44:13] this he started to speak a parable amen
[44:17] and he said that there was a widow woman
[44:18] with a need amen we're not going to be
[44:20] all night and this widow woman amen she
[44:23] had a significant need she had a
[44:27] adversary how many know you got an
[44:29] adversary tonight amen and what happened
[44:32] it might have been a situation where the
[44:34] adversary got the best of her Hallelujah
[44:37] but what I like about her she knew who
[44:40] to go to she went to the judge amen she
[44:44] ain't go crying to her friends she a
[44:47] stop talking to her home girls she a
[44:49] startop talking to her home boys amen
[44:51] asking aunties and cousins and asking
[44:53] people on Facebook she went to the
[44:55] person who could get something done
[44:57] Saints when you get in trouble you
[44:59] better know who to go
[45:01] [Applause]
[45:04] to don't go to somebody that's going to
[45:06] give you some unsound advice amen you
[45:09] need to go to the judge amen am now the
[45:14] Lord using an example of saying that
[45:17] this judge that she had to deal with he
[45:19] was a unjust judge now that's almost a
[45:24] oxy Boron that's a fancy word amen it's
[45:26] the opposite how can somebody be a judge
[45:28] brother Simmons and be an unjust
[45:31] judge how you going to judge correctly
[45:34] as an unjust judge but what Jesus was
[45:37] trying to show us if the unjust judge
[45:40] amen this judge was a bad man he was so
[45:44] bad he ain't care what nobody else in
[45:46] the city said about him Bible say he
[45:49] didn't regard man he a care about man
[45:51] I'm the judge care about nothing he was
[45:54] so bad Saints he ain't even care about
[45:57] God Amen now I know a lot of bad people
[46:01] am and a lot of them still got a fear of
[46:03] God within their heart amen amen if they
[46:05] knew his word better they might well do
[46:07] better but that's our job a to bring the
[46:09] word to people this judge he was so bad
[46:12] amen he didn't fear man neither regarded
[46:16] God Amen but this Widow knew who to go
[46:19] to and she had a need and she went to
[46:22] him the first time and he didn't hear
[46:25] and she went to him again and he didn't
[46:26] didn't hear and she went again with her
[46:28] knee and again with her knee and again
[46:31] with her knee and a and it got to the
[46:34] point where he said oh my
[46:37] goodness this
[46:40] woman she might not got the money to pay
[46:42] me she might not have all the business
[46:44] and all but B this woman she's wearing
[46:47] me down amen amen she's wearing me out
[46:51] with what is going on in her life I
[46:54] don't care about God I don't care about
[46:57] man but what I want to do I need to get
[47:00] this woman off of my case woman I'm
[47:02] going to take care of your problem amen
[47:06] amen now Saints when I think about Jesus
[47:09] amen amen you know we taught amen praise
[47:12] God when we pray God can deliver you
[47:15] immediately amen amen and he operates
[47:18] like that how many seen him operate like
[47:20] that he operates immediately sometimes
[47:22] am amen but the Lord wanted to share a
[47:25] story about the power of being
[47:29] persistent in praise God the Lord want
[47:33] to share a story because sometimes we
[47:35] pray for things Saints amen and it don't
[47:38] move right then amen but the Lord said
[47:41] you know sometimes people would cast you
[47:42] down and say well you didn't have enough
[47:44] Faith to believe amen but the Lord says
[47:47] sometimes I want to see you be
[47:49] persistent GL to God there has to be
[47:53] something within the believer that
[47:55] causes you to be pers istent you can't
[47:58] do that on your own but the power of the
[48:00] Holy Ghost within you will make you be
[48:04] persistent God wants people that are
[48:08] persistent when you get knocked down you
[48:10] get back up again you pray for a
[48:13] situation and something might not happen
[48:16] but he wants you to show cuz he said
[48:18] when the son of man come can I find
[48:20] Faith sometimes Faith shows up amen
[48:24] after I wait it glory to God but there
[48:26] are some people sometimes we don't mind
[48:29] waiting praise God because we know who
[48:32] we waiting on we know that we waiting on
[48:34] a God that loves us hallelujah the book
[48:37] of Galatians the 5th chapter and the
[48:39] sixth verse I believe amen it says that
[48:41] Faith worketh by love glory to God
[48:44] that's a curious thing to say Amen to
[48:47] have faith working by love how can Faith
[48:50] work by love Faith Works by love because
[48:54] if I know that God loves me Hallelujah
[48:57] Oh Glory to God if I know that God loves
[49:00] me I know he's going to take care of me
[49:03] if I know that he loves me I can have
[49:05] faith in them hallelujah sister Tina
[49:08] don't got to worry about me coming home
[49:10] after work cuz she knows that I love her
[49:13] because I love her she can have faith in
[49:16] glory to
[49:17] God because God loves me amen I can have
[49:21] faith in him amen glory to God because I
[49:24] love him amen I can have faith in him
[49:28] glory to God I can even be like Jo job
[49:31] rose up his Testament was though he slay
[49:34] me yet will I trust him glory to God now
[49:38] that's a love and faith relationship
[49:41] even when things are not going good
[49:43] though he slve me Hallelujah yet will I
[49:47] trust amen
[49:48] [Music]
[49:50] amen amen amen amen hallelujah how many
[49:54] love the Lord tonight
[49:59] you can have faith in him amen because
[50:01] he loves you amen and because you love
[50:03] him you can have faith in him
[50:09] amen sometimes God don't always move
[50:13] when we want him to move
[50:15] amen sometimes it's a process of time
[50:18] amen praise God Amen but the scripture
[50:21] lets us know if a unjust judge man that
[50:26] ain't even fear God if he could do that
[50:28] for a widow
[50:30] woman imagine what the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:34] would do for you as an individual you
[50:36] got to make it personally man amen
[50:38] sometimes we look at brother uh Simmons
[50:40] and we look at brother Ernest and we
[50:41] look at Pastor Palmer back there and we
[50:43] think well it's all about the preacher
[50:44] you got to make the thing personal to
[50:46] you that God loves you that you are his
[50:50] elect amen the seventh verse says and
[50:53] shall not God avenge his own elect amen
[50:56] amen y'all know what the word elect mean
[50:59] elect mean that God picked you up
[51:01] specifically praise God might not have
[51:04] been nothing that man would have picked
[51:06] out about you but God runs his election
[51:09] differently and let me tell you tonight
[51:12] if God has elected you there's nothing
[51:15] that nobody else can do about it
[51:18] Hallelujah if you understand that you
[51:20] are the elect of God hold your head up
[51:23] don't look so sad all the time when you
[51:26] walk to your job throw your shoulders
[51:28] back good morning everybody it's good to
[51:31] be here this morning glory to God we had
[51:33] a good time in service on Sunday I'm an
[51:36] elected of God Amen I'm a bride of Jesus
[51:39] Christ he picked me out and chose me
[51:43] even though personally I was not worthy
[51:45] but he looked beyond something that he
[51:48] placed Within Me from before the
[51:50] foundation of the world and it doesn't
[51:52] matter what the devil tries to say
[51:54] against it I'm elected by God
[51:58] am amen
[52:01] amen when they had the election four
[52:03] years ago it didn't matter how bad they
[52:06] didn't want Biden to be in office he got
[52:08] elected to be in office when they just
[52:11] had the election the other day it don't
[52:12] matter how bad people didn't want Trump
[52:14] back in office he won the election and
[52:17] he's back in office what I'm trying to
[52:19] say is when it comes down to election
[52:22] well especially when it come down to
[52:24] God's election whatever he has
[52:27] chosen that is his judgment
[52:30] amen amen now Saints even though we the
[52:33] elect amen we trying to draw to a
[52:36] close God is going to avenge his own
[52:39] elect amen but he uses a curious turn he
[52:43] said which cry day and night unto
[52:48] him you know sometimes we think it's as
[52:50] simple as we pray and we going about our
[52:52] business yes it can be that simple but
[52:55] sometimes amen scripture says weeping
[52:57] may endure for a night amen praise God
[53:01] sometimes we do cry at night amen I'm
[53:04] not excluded from that uh sometimes we
[53:06] done cry all night and we get up in the
[53:08] morning time amen and and the issue is
[53:11] still with us in the daytime amen and
[53:14] the Lord is saying says don't think it
[53:17] unusual if if if sometimes you're
[53:19] fighting issues that linger what the
[53:22] Lord wants you to do is stop worrying
[53:25] and just have have faith in him amen
[53:28] amen amen
[53:30] amen he says sometimes it's day and
[53:33] night sometimes it seems like it's a
[53:36] long time amen praise God but
[53:38] nevertheless Amen in the next verse in
[53:41] the eighth verse he says I tell you even
[53:44] though it might seem like it's a long
[53:45] time amen praise God he says I tell you
[53:49] that he will avenge them speedily
[53:55] am now so sometimes it don't seem like
[53:57] speedily for me it's God speedily amen
[54:01] amen amen praise God Amen sometimes I'm
[54:04] still in the day and night amen
[54:06] sometimes I'm still in the long bear God
[54:08] says I'm judging it and taking care of
[54:10] it speedily Saints I just want to remind
[54:12] you that your timing and God's timing
[54:16] that's right are two different timings
