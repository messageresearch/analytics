Open the Eyes of our understanding Lord and that we oh God just love you more God we want to serve you more in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hebrews 11 1-7 I read the first you read the next and we read the latter verse together the song says oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever I'll be saving grace on the streets of Glory praise God let me live a voice it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen too through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear for by faith in it was translated that he should not see there and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleads God six together by Faith Lord being warned of God of things not yet see yeah with the heart for the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became ears of the righteousness which is by faith the baby seated God bless you amen God is good amen now we want to talk about the super sense of Faith to Sixth Sense amen so by the grace of God we understand that the we have five senses and those five senses contact the Earthly the Earthly man and thou Earthly environment by the grace of God it's but only to a Christian we have what we call the sixth sense of the super sense we have to be a Christian we have to be born again that means we have to be have the Holy Ghost Western remarkable in these last days as we look at the world it's very very dog settings the world is setting in a very dark time that we're living in and I'm gonna tell you everywhere you look it's just Darkness and um because the world is so dumb you know I I wrote down the other day let your lights shine let your light shine why because the world is so full of Darkness so in Isaiah 60 it says arise Shine for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon him thee for Behold The Darkness ship cover the Earth and grossed Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee because we're living in such a dark time then it's almost like the people have lost the sense of what's right and what's wrong it seems like we're living in a world that we don't care anymore it's just about that Satan has just about taken over but in Hebrews talked about the days of Noah and I believe we have entered into the darkest time in world history we've entered into a place that is so dog to people or just giving themselves over to lasciviousness the things of the world the lust of this world they've just they're just in drafted it and I said boy if you were on the other side of the chasma and you look out and you see how dark it is then you say oh God have mercy but you know if to a person that lived in darkness all the time it's not really down to them because that's the way they live they lived in dog so you're accustomed to dog it's like the fish at the bottom of the ocean it's real deep it's real dark and they're pressurized to it so one that's you know living down in the depths of the ocean if he comes up and saw the lighting being another it'd be almost another world so it's like that we were sometimes in darkness we were so we lived in darkness it's like a blind man a blind man that never saw before he learned to adjust themselves to the darkness and we in time passed in the five cents room we walked in the flesh and remind the things of the flesh so by the grace of God you couldn't tell us that it was another dimension it was another place it was another kingdom the the Colossians says he's delivered us out of the power of Darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now we don't know if you never I could talk about a kingdom you know I could talk about you know you know over in South Africa I could talk about over in Romania but that's just talking you know what I'm saying maybe you can even look at it on you know to see the Lions and the elephants and different things but once you're there in the presence and it it it it sheds a Different Light you see it you write down So you you're in the Africa you're in these different countries and it's just like a word that you heard about but you don't know really you know you heard that it exists and you've seen pictures that exist but you really had not experienced that world and I'm saying there's certain things that we have not experienced it's a world of the Unseen realm and we're talking about the super sense only Christians are able to visualize and enter into that place only when we're born again do we understand that Kingdom that because heaven is a faith in the super sense is is higher than the heavens is away from the earth so that's how high Heaven I mean the supersets faith faith come by hearing and hear and come by the word of God so the light that we are talking about that we should let in I'm talking about this just start world and uh uh uh Proverbs uh 4 and 18. proverbs 4 and 18 says 4 and 18. it says but the path of the just is as a what the path of the Justice as a Shining Light the path of the Justice as a Shining Light praise God the Bible said the just shall live by faith isn't that right but the path of the justice is as a Shining Light praise God and then I says you know let your light so shine I'm not trying to preach so much as I'm trying to talk to you a little bit because we're in a state amen that this world is going farther and further and deeper and deeper into the darkness demon powers satanic forces are planned in the world into deeper so they're being dumb you know it gets so dark you know that you won't be able to see light at all and that's why God has to come and get the little light that's left in this world he has to take us up and Rapture us because he said if it was possible here deceived the very leg so the world is getting so twist up and it's getting so dark that there's no hunger and thirst there's no desire for righteousness there's no desire for God people the Bible says in the days of Noah every imagination and thought of men heart was continually evil so it's getting to that point that he said as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Life thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this thing is getting so dark amen so every thought and every imagination and everything that's in the heart of men was going to be so evil and so corrupt so you wonder what's eating at you you wonder why things are just pulling in the forces of darkness is trying to suck us into a deep hole so that's it's almost like it's it's a pool it's a force that really pulling on us trying to a woo us into that dark place and you wonder why there's so many mass shootings all over the place people just go you know they're just losing it they're just look at all these hosts calling schools and all and people are again to the point that then it's not going to be hosts the people just gone they're just going to go chaoted and that's what's going on we have to break I think the President says we had to break we had a point a Tipping Point we're at an edge with Armageddon can break forth at any time the battle of Armageddon which is the last war the third world war it could go forth if a set of Russia release those nuclear bombs then that would start Armageddon and it tempted to do it you're right at the edge if they're pushed to do that then where are we going to be well we're in a world where what we're doing now That's How we'll continue with we want now we want everything now but what we're saying there's a super sense that the world that you can live in and you can be comfortable and you can have peace but this world here has nothing for tomorrow is not promising today is the day of salvation today if you will hear his voice he said heart not your heart so we're living in the now now Faith is the substance of things hopeful it's the evidence of Things Not Seen so I'm trying to tell you though you're not looking at it now it's real there is a real realm that is a place called the super sense that is a faith places a place of Faith a place where there's light he says here proverbs 4 and 18 but the path of the just is as a Shining Light and I said to just shall live by faith and we said in Matthew 5 it says let your lights shine amen that that's Shining Light that shineth more and more until the what perfect day are you whipping the path for the justice that The Shining Light was shining more and more to the perfect day that is a perfect day coming amen the day of redemption draws nine men hearts are failing because of fear but there is a day of where the redeem of the Lord will be caught up to meet him that redeemed us the Lord Jesus Christ we are near not our we're so close to that time we're so close to the hour where God will take his people out of here because it's so dull we can't stand too much more of what's going on let me just look at Matthew's what I was saying let your light shine because the we need Faith to get out of here Matthew 5. we need Faith to get out of here because if we don't get in a hurry for God the devil is going to take this world into a spin and to a place the Bible said the world is going to be turned upside down like a drunk man and I tell you this world has been turned upside down the devil is taking driving folks into insanity we were talking about how insane the world is the world is totally sometimes you look at the condition in the schoolhouse but they don't even know it the world has gone insane and don't don't have no understanding of it they they just out of it they they don't even know that they're insane why because everybody else is so if everybody else says only the ones that got a little light the little light shine and those are only ones that and they what they look like they look crazy the ones that trying to live for God and got a little light shine those are the ones that look crazy those are the ones that look uh where you come from another world you're on another planet you know come on be real so what happens the people don't know that they're living in Insanity that the devil has taken their minds but I was saying if I were gossipingly here this is the number of the loss whom the God of this world has what blinded to what the mind the devil has blinded people mind so bad but that's got to be somebody that said God I want God Lord Jesus I want to live for you there's got to be somebody that's hungering and thirsting other than that amen they're going to be pulled in that sankhole into that pit called hell they're gonna and then it's a chaotic life brother Nathan and I was talking he says God he was talking about a a nightclub which is saying call the atmosphere and how everybody you know the The Prestige people were there and the people that they thought was somebody in Colombia he said but everything in there was you know people had turned people that you thought was a man and thought was a woman it was all twisted up in there he said he said you know sometimes now if he was talking about 30 40 years ago how chaotic it is was I'm telling you what is the condition now what do you think how you think things look now if he was so scared it was so scary being how scary is it now I'm gonna tell you so you know I you know I was preaching uh mother English funeral and she was 102. I can say I I can imagine how things look you know when she was a girl and then passing through to over uh in the new century and all of that I said God she must say oh Lord what kind of world is those things beyond your imagination things that you thought you'll never see and myself being the 70 years old we didn't think this thing would get this bad the world will get in the condition it's in now and then where's the hope for our children where's the hope for our Grands they the only safe place the only place we can run to and find rest is in Jesus Christ that's the only safe place the only place we can point them to because they're gone The World Is Gone they gone and they don't even know they're gone they're gone to the road they can't return they cross that line of coming back [Music] brother and sister and you wonder where the pressure is coming from we'll look for help and we want to be helped we want we we want somebody to understand and we want to help Lord Lord I need help Lord I need something now but how can we get help that we're not coming to the one that can't help us we'll turn into every kind of resource we can but the one that really can help us we don't want his help the one that can really give us what we're looking for but we don't want it from him give it to us Lord I need help no we're not saying Lord we're trying to get every resource we can to help us but the only one that could really help us is the one that we don't want because we don't think that oh God it's not for me oh the love of God the one that loves you the best the one that cares more about your soul the one to care more about your life but we don't want him the one that can really give us that which our soul is thirsting for our heart needs but we don't want him it's just like a young lady a nice young man that it's got an education got a nice job trying to live a Christian Life she don't want him she wants a thug somebody that's gonna slap and beat on her she wants that kind of person she wants somebody with their pants hanging down and Chained and around the neck and you know stuff like that and you want somebody to look cool and slick but she don't want a young man that's going to take care of her be a husband to her father to the children she don't want that kind of man she want a cool slick dude you know and the kind of God we we we picture we don't want a God that's that's going to love us and go care for us and amen now died for us and give himself for us in a supply all of our needs we don't want that kind of God that really loves us really is concerned about us really care for us will it supply all your needs ah no say because the world that we've accustomed to that we're living in we're living in the five cents realm and and we're operating down we don't know nothing about amen this other world that we're talking about the faith the super sense we don't know nothing about that we don't understand that and when you talk about it it seems to be a fairy tale are you with me but it's real it's not a fairy tale it is another place that you can go and you can find so let's there the prophet said I say unto you shalom peace there's another place and brother and sister I trust that you and I would come to that place to what I really need amen I can't understand I'm I'm feeling this way and I'm designed to go in a way that the way I feel uh the way I understand but God is saying this Faith the super sense this place that I want to take you amen only where you can understand it is to be born again amen the only way you can get there amen you got to desire you got to hung in thirds you got to say God I want it he's not going to force himself [Music] they're not going to force himself on you he's not going to make you live right it ain't it ain't so much about living right as we thinking that I can't do this I can't do that I want you to God it's God ain't about that it may look that way it's just that God gives us another desire it's not that I can't do this and I I can't do that but it looks that way sometimes because sometimes we're saying don't do this and don't do that but it's not that it's that it's another life that wants to live itself through you it's another person that amen that God wants you to come and acquainted with amen that God says I want to release to you I want you to understand that that's something Beyond this one and this light here it's another life that exists it's called eternal life it's called Zoe it's called God's own life there is another one that I want you to come in contact I want you to know me the source of life God wants you to be in contact with the Creator the one that cares more about you than you care about yourself don't want to know more about you than you know about yourself God wants you to be acquainted with him in his love but yet we because of this flesh rim because we're so caught up and because we don't understand it and it looks like it looked to us in the flesh a Christian walk and a Christian Life look like a life that is gonna cause uh cause me to look like uh hey hey it's gonna cause me to look huh no and a lot of people have come in contact with their life and tried to live that kind of Christian Life and try to walk the Christian walk amen what amen they wasn't born again so to them it was bondage because they tried to do something without him being there so they called a Christian Life a life amen of do's and don'ts and laws and amen but they lived under the law amen but faith is not a law amen it's something that was brought up that Abraham paid tithes while he was yet in the arms of his father I mean Levi paid tithes while he was yet in the lungs of his father Abraham it was it was by faith that he did it it wasn't that uh you got to do it because if you don't do it you're going to be cursed no he if nobody talked about being cursed with Abraham he paid ties to Melchizedek it wasn't nothing to mention about amen if you don't do it you're gonna be he just did it because it was a revelation revealed to him he wanted to do it and I'll tell you something what you receive the Holy Ghost once you receive Jesus Christ by faith you want to live right it's not nothing that I I'm pressured in and mama said I can't do this and Daddy's saying the preachers say in the church say it's not about none of that stuff that all is about is uh I love him and I want to please him this is what I want because why I'm a new creature I'm a new creation I want my faith not by saying praise God I'm living in a place amen that I'm pleased to dwell in praise God I'm living I'm living a life that I love because I love him because he is alive amen and I come in contact with what life is really real and what it's all about because before I I thought I had it just because we come to church and we get a new spirit maybe we stop drinking and stop smoking and maybe we stop lying but never come all the way brother Nathan and myself was talking about you know starting off on the Christian Journey we had some ups and downs and twists in turn but I said I knew it within myself that I I didn't total surrender yet I said but when it came to that place when I told her surrender my life then I got to know Jesus then I was able to receive the Holy Ghost but before you know I was trying to live I wanted to live it I wanted to do right but I had battles and I didn't cross over yet are you with me and see some of the times we have those battles within ourselves that we know amen we haven't given up the world we haven't given up everything you know but when we realize is it worth it it's Jesus Christ is eternal life worth giving up everything for do you love him enough to give up everything do you love him enough to believe that he has a better place well he said in my father's Kingdom In My Father's House of many mentions do you love him enough to believe that he's do you believe his report do you believe what he's saying is right do you believe that God was faithful do you believe that he's not lying to you do you believe that he's telling you the truth do you believe that he's got something better for you that hey Hallelujah that the devil can ever offer you so he said eyes are not seen ear have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the thing that God has prepared for them that would love him to them that I have faith in him to them that I have confidence in him God has something better for you but brothers and sisters up to you to take advantage of God's opportunity that he presents to you that he wants to give you you must take it's available to you but one day it won't be a failover no more so it's not about a lot of do's and don't say you you must do this and you've got to do that if you don't do this amen you're going to hell it ain't about amen you're going to hell if you don't and if I don't do this oh God the preacher's gonna be mad at me God don't be mad at you God don't want you to be scared of him God wants you to love him praise God Amen who wants to marry somebody that you're scared of who wants to be in love with somebody amen that that you're scared of that that if you do wrong it gonna punish you you got to be in love with God Amen get get over the fear I I know I'm gonna I'm gonna go to hell I know God don't get me if I feeling about God God gave me if I do wrong oh Lord no no no no it's not a scary place rather than sister it's not see sometimes we we live in the fear I better not do that because uh it's a it's another whole world we don't we don't even live like that amen as a young person I didn't live like I can't do this I can't do that no no no no no it wasn't that it's it was another whole it was a joy to know the Lord and to live for the Lord it was a joy it was a piece amen I didn't want to do it I didn't want to do it no more I didn't want to live that way no more no because why I found real life real purpose so I didn't want to do it no more wasn't the battle was it a fight I think the devil would always you're gonna have to fight for every inch of the ground you're gonna have to fight continually that's why Jude said I would let you earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints there's a constantly contending for the faith because there's a faith that God wants you to fight and I'm saying in such a dark world he said let your light so shine the men should see your good works and glorify your father which is heaven amen so it's a fight every day amen to let the light shine why because amen the devil will have you to back up or reverse amen where you at he wants you to go backwards instead of forward and so what happens you have to stand fast in the Liberty where will Christ have made you free and be not again entangled with the Yoke abundance amen God you know I I said you must have a a freedom about yourself Lord I own the sunset free is free indeed there's so many Christians walk around bound all up and that's why people and people can say well I tried it I tried to be a Christian I tried to live like that I tried to be one of those amen but I I found myself that it was a lot of bondage so what happens people have have made Christianity a disgrace instead of Grace because they can say well I'm still saved I'm still a Christian but I can live like I want I can do like I want to but I still know God I still love God I love him just as much as you do no doubt you do I believe the Cain loved God just as much as Ava loved God because he wouldn't offer sacrifice to God but he wanted to he loved God in his own way he wanted to do it his own way amen but Abel recognized that it was the blood it was a Redemption amen it was a price that God paid amen praise God it was I it was the blood it was a rejection it was all about redeeming me it was about oh I'm telling you God had a Redemption plan and God Amen redeemed us was his own blood he gave himself for us praise God Amen it was Redemption amen and sometimes we want to do it with bypassing Calvary but I'm saying if you get a good look at Calvary and what Jesus did for you amen you see amen there's nothing that we could do for ourselves but it was the blood of Jesus amen he loved us so much that he gave himself for us praise God he loved us so much that he lived on his life he was able to be mocked get on talk about Hallelujah God that cared so much about us didn't do no wrong all he did was good yeah they didn't want him Hallelujah that's all God want to do for you all he wants to do is heal your body is all he wants us to do amen praise God and Supply your needs all he wants to do is do your goods but yet we don't want him that will take up arrivals that will say crucify him all he wants to do is do good to us well do we believe it do we really believe that God wants to do us good and not evil amen he said the thief come to kill to steal and destroy but I'm come that they might have life and that they made Heaven more abundantly God comes to give your life that's what the thief wants to do the kill the steel and this draw you but whoa what we're believing we believe in the thief amen we believe in that life of the devil we believe in what we feel what we see what we think and not what our hearts really need not what our deep call into the deep The Thirst of our soul only God can supply that I can't make you see and I can't make you wanna praise God I Think Jesus has already done enough that he said whosoever will let him come are you with me seeing the world has gone its fault so they're taking the word and they just crucified maybe in time passed we we've had our mistakes as ministers we've had our mistakes amen but we're preaching a god of love a God that really cares about you maybe sometimes as parents we made our mistakes but God wants you to know it's not a dudes that don't it's not a law but it's the love that we want you to know we want you to love him with all your heart because we have come in contact with a loving God a god of love a God that cares about us maybe look from the outside I don't want you to do that I want you to go that way I don't want you to do this maybe we look like a lot of do's and don'ts and a lot of laws maybe we've been guilty but brother and sister we're being guilty please forgive us but this is a god of love and we want you to receive the love of God are you with me and we want you to because you're loving amen you want to hey yeah see is love the essence of God himself amen it's his life I gotta go from now and I might I might be real short here he says Paul says I'm crucified with Christ amen nevertheless he said I live amen but he says it's not me that's living amen yet not I but Christ liveth in me in the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself for me amen Who Loved Me and gave himself from me that's what's going on so this is not something that's hard it's difficult why because the one that I accept I receiveth my Lord my savior he not only I mean he came down and the old man is crucified the life that I used to live the things that I used to do it was crucified it died he said it it's not your spirit that died but it was the nature of your spirit that's what God died that old nature died are you with me and God gives you his divine nature and when you got that divine nature inside you amen praise God praise God if I had the Spirit uh a Beethoven are you a man if you had the spirit amen of some great philosopher Plato's you you'll be able to save some of those great things it's whatever spirit is in you if you've got a spirit of Christ in you there is not something that you're trying to be a Christian it's not a task it's not a work it's a life it's a life the life of the sheep is in the Sheep amen he has the nature of the Lamb are you a man in the nature of Wrath within us the centers we wanted to do wrong we desired to do wrong but when in the Christ came in our lives we had a new nature we had to do desires we wanted to live for God but we don't want to force Christ on you either because I said I keep on saying God told me I won't lose one I'm not going to lose not one of my children not one that God but I'm gonna tell you something you can take your time amen but God won't lose one but I'm glad I came when I came because he saved me from going through a lot of things God saved my life saved my soul and he let me not go through a lot of things the other people that waited went through so I'm glad I came when I came because it saved me from a lot of things you know you I can look at my brother and I can look at this one in that one and I said God you saved me from a lot of things so I'm glad I came when I came I'm glad when he called me amen I hesitated I didn't want to come but I'm glad I came when I came I didn't want to come here I I did I didn't want to come because I had too many other plans too many things I wanted to do I didn't want to come but I'm glad I came because I see God calling others and they didn't come but they had to go through some things because they didn't come when he called them are you a man praise God we made a choice to delay we read we made it we made our own choice to wait till we get some things that we wanted to do out of the way we made our own decision I made that decision but God just didn't let me just keep on making that decision God just kept talking at my heart and then I it opened my eyes and he let me see my mama prize was really answered she said Lord open that boy eyes and you know that's what I want I want somebody else to be open

do you do you believe he love you do you believe that he knows what's best do you believe that that life is available whether or not you want it or not that God cares enough about you to understand what you go through even when you think it's too late that I made them too many mistakes to get my life together the things that I want we may be young and we desire certain things and we think that I
