that need the baptism of the holy ghost father may you grant it now bless your word now in jesus name amen genesis 6 and 1 and it came to pass that when men began to multiply on the face of the earth that the daughters were born unto them and the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which were cho which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be in 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came into the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination and thought of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord's in the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man beasts and creeping things and the files of the air for it repented me that i have made them but nor found grace in the eyes of the lord may god bless you read this word you may be seated this morning as we talk about imagination i remember when i was in the world they said saying a song was just my imagination running away with me and i believe the imagination have ran the way with the fault the imagination i want to look at luke 17 luke 17. and i believe folks imagination has ran completely away from them and when we talk about imagination we're talking about purpose and desire it's continually evil god saw that the purpose and desire of man in that particular day was continually evil and we know that this is an evil age that we're living in and the god of this evil age is satan amen the world has been polluted with demon powers and everywhere you look the devil looked like he's controlling he meant the political the religious and the spiritual realm and those three unclean spirits like frogs amen but god amen with amen the pale horse rider riding in death and hell riding god will amen when the enemy come in like a flood then god would send an eagle an anointing amen the man faced of an eagle amen was the type of john amen you had matthew mark luke and john john wrote about writing as an eagle as god amen matthew wrote about him as a lion as a king amen mark wrote about him as an ox as a servant amen and luke wrote about him as a man amen but john wrote about him as an eagle god we need an eagle in this age and he said whether caucus is there where the eagles should be gathered together amen where the fresh manner is that where the eagles be gathered together amen praise god not the budget but the eagles praise god we are eagles amen because this is the eagle age amen praise god this is the age where we're not on milk but meat amen praise god it's time to fly amen praise god the lion is earthbound amen praise god the oxes are pound amen but amen and the man is earthbound but the eagle is heavily bound amen he gets up off the ground praise god the lion didn't get milk praise god dogs get milk praise god the man get milk but the ego won't meet are you with me so when the time of meat strong meat it don't belong to them praise god that are back in another age but in this age we need meat we need to be strong praise god we need to be stripped amen oh god our battle amen praise god oh god the weapon of our warfare not carnal but they are mighty to god to the pulling down of strongholds i i got to get the hole hold it a minute i'm going too fast amen but god amen wants you to understand amen where you are in this age in this day and what you need in order to overcome amen the spirit of this age praise god the spirit that you were fighting and you up against you need to understand what you're up against amen that you might prepare for battle but you got to have something to fight with and amen and the greatest weapon that god can give you is his word amen his word defeat every devil and every demon that comes against you but you got to be skillful and know how to use the word hallelujah so here in luke 17 26 he says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the what notice he said the days so it's just not one day it's days they meant son of man son of david and son of god amen jesus was called son of man he's also called son of god and he's also called son of david praise god when they saw him as son of man he they saw him as a prophet praise god the son of god through the church ages the baptism of the holy ghost through the ages are you with me praise god but back again he comes before at the end time the son of man amen to bring in an usher in the millennium the son of david when he reigns as king for a thousand years on the throne amen in the millennial reign our lord is coming back to earth again a thousand years he'll reign are you with me so amen there is a oh god i can't get into too much just touching amen basis but brothers and sisters amen god got something in store for you that loved him amen god amen the earth amen amen the devil is going to be bound in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and we'll come back here to reign with him for a thousand years are you a man praise god the devil will rebound by circumstances are you with me he can't do nothing amen because there'll be peace the prince of peace amen and the government shall be upon his shoulder are you a man oh god it's you on the expectation amen it's worth what you're going through now everything that you're going through now amen is preparing you amen for what god has in restore for you whoa so here it says son of in the days of the son of man 27. they did what they ate they did eat amen they drank they what not just one they marry what is it not the condition of our age the day we living in that's what they did back then they married wives they just didn't matter one time two times this is my wives are you with me prophet of god it says a lot of times dealing with their they're just shacking up are you with me so a lot of times folks don't even want to go through the legal ramification of getting married they just go from woman to woman and man to man they just just loose are you with man they don't want to have to be bound up amen in a marriage relationship amen they just won't oh god it says the married wise and were given in what marriage until the day the noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them what praise god isn't it sad that like it was then so shall it be now likewise also as it was in the days of what days of our lives they did what they ate in the what and they what you know sometimes you have to stop buying and just stand still long enough you get a little money in your pocket you want to buy just buy you can't um so that can't be satisfied with nothing just go get it why are you getting i feel like i won't do so i want that stand still a little while praying sometimes instead of getting give find a way to give somebody and bless somebody but we're too busy trying to being selfish looking at ourselves how many times have you thought about somebody else we we're so stingy he said blessed is the one cheer for what okay and you you wonder why it's more blessed to what give then what see sometimes folk don't receive because they're not givers you got to be a giver to receive oh i wonder why i'm not blessed you're not a giver amen one of my other folks are blessed and i'm not blessed you're not a giver if i had to give i give give what you got amen you might not have much but give what you got and god will bless that what you give but if you hold back on god you know the holy ghost never spoke to anybody to give such and such do this many times the lord said empty your pocket and i said oh goodness hit me in my pocket give everything you got it's empty he said you can't think about it if you thought about it you ain't gonna empty it you said that muscle was uh i don't know what that was spoken to me tell me you know you question it but when god tell you to be a blessing to so-and-so a lot of times folks don't listen to the voice of god there's more blessings to give than it is to receive but some so many people so trying to bless themselves by receiving so much all they can see is the dollar sign and the more they see dollars the more they want dollars and they think they blessing themselves sometimes god give to you for you to give to somebody else it's not for you it's for you to give but a lot of times folk get and they think that's the blessing of the lord that they can just keep getting and building bonds and bigger bonds and bigger bonds and say so be at ease and take your rest and some of the bigger givers are the biggest the bigger blessings people that are being blessed extraordinary because they give and they give freely from the heart and god keep on blessing them those that give grudges amen and sparingly but those that give with a cheerful heart they began to be blessed abundantly are you with me but a lot of people give and they give on they average their dollar i used to see preachers that had tremendous jobs and i used to see you have a meeting they put their dollar in you know they said minimum wages went up but they showed that dollar didn't change god blessed them more but they gave the same much no matter how many times god bless them they kept this is what i give you know when god bless you your giving should increase the more god bless you the more your giving should increase are you with me but if you hold back on god and don't try to be a blessing to somebody else but trying to bless yourself the more you try to bless yourself all kind of stuff will begin to happen to your cause something happened on the job something happening in your body something happen this way and you every time you try to bless yourself you end up cursing yourself are you a man don't try to bless your own self and make your own self rich amen if god wants you to be rich it'll come to you amen you don't have to strive to be labeled to be rich amen having food and women learn to be content amen god wants you to be contented because some folk the rich pierced themselves with many sorrows are you with me some folk because the love of money is what some folk is in the the root of all evil because they love dollar signs it's the root of all evil the love of it amen so when you love it you ain't gonna give it up are you with me because you love it amen you think oh i'm already broke and you think broke your i talk broke and you'll be broke are you up man praise god but you talk i'm blessed i'm blessed in spite of god has blessed me and i'm continually blessed amen praise god and you begin to receive from god amen as you speak it into existence amen you have what you say amen praise god if you say it and don't mean it amen but you a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways amen praise god you send it to consume it upon your own lust amen and that's why god ain't giving you nothing because he know what you're going to do with it praise god you want to lift yourself up somewhere where you don't need to be are you i don't know why i'm going this way praise god but it takes a humble spirit to realize the will of god and the purpose of god and why god wants to bless you but you recognize when god the lessons flow to you amen you ought to be a blessing to somebody else that ain't that wasn't in there i just put that on the sideline for dessert it wasn't in the message okay said here we are and floyd came and destroyed them all 28. likewise also as it was in the days of what lot they did eat they drank they bought their soul and they what planted and they what you can't get man they're building everywhere isn't that right y'all wonder how it was in the days of noah and how it was in the days a lot he said but the 29th verse but the same day the lot went out of sodom it rained what out of heaven and what god give us a chance to get out of sodom and gomorrah are you with me y'all see the world today y'all think this world world round it's another solomon gomorrah are you are y'all with me the condition of this world amen is a solomon gomorrah world it's a as it was in the days of knowing as it was in the days of sodom amen praise god the spirits are taking over the world fallen angels have pressed themselves into men bodies amen because they re oh god let me let me go read this last verse even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise god as lot amen was done in sodom abraham wasn't in sodom praise god and three angels came and visited abraham and said shall i hide from abraham the thing the bible says surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals the secret to his servant the prophet isn't that right so before god does any major thing he reveals it to a prophet and the prophet get warned and before judgment are you what man so amen and abraham interceded for a lot and said lord pray eventually if you find ten will you spare the city these are out spat if i find 10. you mean to tell me when god comes back he ain't going to find 10 on this whole earth you know the prophet god says one in a million isn't that right out of a million you might find one praise god look at how many million people in this world are you with me but you got to say i'm one in a million i thank god i'm one of them praise god it might be a million amen but i'm one of them i'm one in a million let's just see how faithful we can be to god's word let's see how faithful we can be to god amen your life is a manifestation of what you believe it doesn't it doesn't matter what you say but your life speak louder than your words oh you look man so you got to look recognize that every thought and imagination amen and what as a man thinketh in his heart what so is he every imagination that thought a men's heart was continually what evil so man heart amen praise god is despitefully wicked and who can know it says jeremiah oh you look man so who oh i gotta go but he said here in the third even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now amen god was revealing himself to abraham before solomon burned isn't that right so god reveals himself to us in this age before amen uh the world burns are you with me so we have a revelation that god will come and speak to us and reveal the son of man ministry to us in this age so we have a son of man ministry amen revealed to us to get us ready amen and to call you and i out of sodom we've been called out amen but we what amen we wasn't in sodom as the denominational system was are you up there i'm talking to you two kind of ways are you with me i hope you receive it praise god for those that don't understand amen abraham never was in solomon it was locked because he saw the green grass and the greased grass fooled them so he ended up in sodom he pitched his tent towards what sodom but he ended up where when you put your tent towards the things of the world you end up in the world amen all you got to do is put your tent in that direction amen because you you're looking at the green grass and the green grass or what it'll fool you amen praise god the the grass look greener on the uh on the other side when you get in on the other side you realize amen it's hard to come back over on the lord's side isn't that right somebody i i got to move on uh let's go to romans 1. we're you know we're in an evil age where people don't want truth no more and they don't want you to tell the truth they try to bind you up if you tell truth they're going to say amen praise god there's something wrong with you amen because we we we've been made to accept by intellectual knowledge we got to accept sin amen what the devil try to make a a a better world to sin in are you with me but god want to get us out of this cosmos this world order amen god wanted to give us amen a new heaven and a new earth so god amen does it in spirit realm amen in spirit realm he said any man be in christ jesus he's a new one he's a new creature he's a new creation god has recreated you in christ jesus unto good works are you what man so he said let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be good with god he said therefore being transformed by the renewing of your mind are you with me that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god isn't that right so god gives us a new creation with a new mind we don't think like the world thing praise god your thoughts are not my thoughts uh are you with me so god we started thinking heavenly amen we start thinking like our father the amen praise god because we have the mind of god they met praise god and the mind we had was a he met praise god with the enmity against god and wasn't subject to the laws of the god and neither indeed could it be but god has transformed our mind amen he's given us the mind of christ praise god we've been changed praise god the gospel has changed our lives jesus has come in and he transformed us praise god you might not see it on the outside but there's been an inner walking praise god god has romans 1 21 how was it in the days of sodom and so it shall be in the days of son of man these things had to be the atlas field had to be right for the fire so don't think it's strange my brothers and sisters concerning the strange the trials that you have to go through and the things that the earth is going through well it it had to get in the spirit of sodom before the destruction come it had to get in the spirit of noah before the flood came amen so the world had to get in that spirit so the world is moving in that spirit but don't let that spirit get on you praise god don't let those demons clutch amen cling and get a hold of you praise god hallelujah i i might as well gonna say it ahead of time i may not get to that scripture i said again the weapons of our warfare are not conor but they're almighty to god through to pulling down or what and they're casting on what amen every thought and imagination in the heart of man was continually what their purpose in the desire was evil amen but i said you got to cast down imagination if you don't cast on imagination amen that those evil imagination those evil thoughts amen if you don't cast them down they're going to cast you down amen are you with me so you got to turn around and not let the devil amen take your mind and praise god give you the desires of the world amen amen praise god you got to cast them down or they'll cash you down praise god you got to tell the devil i rebuke you satan get your hands get out of here praise god you got to realize this again it's imminent it's against the word it's anti-christ it's against the word are you with me you can't receive any spirit but the spirit to be of god amen praise god and the spirit of god is the word of god and living in life form in living form amen the word made life okay but by the grace of god 21 romans 1 21 because when they knew god they what neither were what people ain't glad to be saved i'm thankful that god saved me how about you aren't you glad to be saying something it's like my sister said she she said i just was trying to i raised my hand i couldn't hold it up that long been on that respirator for about two or three months she said i i just raised it up a little bit and she said she said bro thank the lord i can raise both of my hand and praise the lord amen you know and that was encouraging me to me because some folk won't lift their hand now how many demons holding your hand down some people won't open their mouth to praise the lord how many divas holding you from praising the lord amen but i'm in courage they've been setting up with her to make me encouraged i i come back to tell you you better praise the lord why you got to change thank him every day for the lord is good his blessing is everlasting hey god praise god amen until god gives you life amen he said i come that they might have life and life more abundantly until god do something inside of you to give you a praise when you've been delivered and god give you a prayer hey god god give your praise praise god you can't help yourself amen god give me something to be thankful about that meant something that i can praise the lord praise god when you're in sin you can't praise god it sin got you bound up in chains of darkness amen when god set you free whom the son is set free it's free indeed i'm glad to be free how about you they wasn't thankful and and because folks ain't thankful whenever you get a people that won't praise the lord and won't be thankful to god you got the people in trouble you got an is in trouble when they wake up in the morning they think they walk they suffer when they got the health and strength they they don't need god they got a little money in their pocket they think they think they something they can't tell them nothing they ain't thankful and then they want to say some spirit some creator somebody somewhere they don't want to get thankful to jesus christ they said know you that the lord he's god it is he that what made us and not we are you with me we ought to know that isn't that right god is good he says they were neither were thankful but became what vain amen in their what and i said their purpose and desires vain in their imagination people do something just because god word said don't do it when you're inspired by the devil you're going to do what god said don't do because the devil wants you to fight against god amen you folk out there they they're fighting against god amen they're saying god what you think about do something about it amen that's why the folk are they almost praised satan and they said if god is real let him do something about it man you talking about some mean people these young people don't lost it amen they'll fight against god and think they're getting by it's only when they get down in the bed of affliction or something happen in life they realize they need somebody and they don't know who that somebody is because they've been living in an imaginary world amen they've been living uh talking to they meant spiritual gods and demons out of the pits of hell fallen angels and they've been led by those spirit gods amen and the spirit had guided them into the pits of darkness and once they're in the realm in the dimension of darkness they can't get out of that deep dark hole amen because they have ventured into somewhere it meant that satan controls and they think that they're in control but they're in a dark place praise god satan to inspire you to fight against god i was wondering after satan being loosed out of the bottomless pit after the thousand years to finish how he could get the people together and come against god amen and the lord come down amen to fight i said that devil amen been bound up but he he won't give up he'll keep on fighting until god has been annihilated amen destroy him once and for all and i'm saying to you amen praise god if the devil is inspiring you against the word amen that comes from the pits of hell and one day amen you'll recognize that your god gonna come down amen you can't fight against god and win i say you won't win they became vain in the imagination and their foolish hearts were what come on fool is said in his heart there's no god i didn't say i didn't call you fool but the bible said the fool said in his heart there's no god the bible said their foolish hearts were amen when you mess around with god your heart is dark amen you said change the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made into what corruptable who man think he's they're their own god i'm god yeah you the devil will deceive you isn't that right because they did not like to retain god in his knowledge god gave them up until amen corruptable and and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up until what uncleanness through the what the lust of their own hearts when you're messing around with god god you know the lust of their own heart what your heart will i want to be this i want to do this and you know it's against the word nobody gonna stop me i'm big i'm bad i'm tough i'm rough got to go here until your own destruction amen it's to your own hurt praise god god trying to keep you away from hurting yourself and destroying your own soul praise god the bible says so i'm pulling them out of the fire they meant the purpose of the word we're trying to pull you out to fire you praise god but some folk go pull away from you when you try to pull them out of the fire they they headed right to the fire right to destruction oh but i will hope that it makes a difference that this gospel amen will pull you out of the fire [Music] he says their own lusts they meant lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own way dishonor their own body between who changed the truth of god into what amen because in the pulpit they changed the truth of god to a lie the word that they preach over the pulpit has taken effect on the world because they did not like to retain god in their knowledge they didn't want the word of god the preachers in the pulpit playing around with the word won't tell the people the truth amen and because they did not like to retain oh it says here change the truth of god into allah amen i got to move on amen it's time out for playing church and worshiping served the creature more than what who is blessed forever amen for this cause god gave them up until vowel what the vile affections god will give you up you don't want god god says okay fine oh it's all right i just give you up that's what you want you don't want me just do what you want every imagination and thought of man's heart was continually what evil so god gave them you know do what you want what do you want you don't want god what do you want if you don't want god what you want god give you up to it amen people wonder why these spirits cling hold to them because amen you're not thankful you're not thankful for jesus dying on the cross and shedding this precious blood you're you're not thankful for what god has done for you you're you're not grateful for that you don't say thank you jesus for waking me this morning thank you jesus for giving me health and strength thank you jesus for amen watching over me thank you jesus for keeping me thank you jesus for all your blessings thank you jesus but when folk amen don't have time to tell god thank you and they're not thankful anymore god amen they don't want god but just cause god gave them up to vile affection for even their women did change the natural use unto that which is against what against nature likewise also men leaving the natural use of the what burn in their what lust one towards what men huh y'all men with what what say it again is that the bible or did was that what uh brother simmons preacher is that the bible if we don't like it you just throw your bible away amen but if the bible is the word of god and we believe what the word of god say we didn't need we need to holy dear hold that word up because you don't want to be released on you these evil spirits praise god without the word protecting us these evil spirits will be released in our lives the word have i heard in my heart that i might not sin against you the word is your protection amen it's your shield it's your bucket it's your keeper amen praise god if you abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will and i'll do it amen keep yourself surrounded by the word amen because as long as you stay in the word god will protect you from these evil spirits praise god but the word today are telling you you must bear with this evil and we have become amen what we want to have friendship with the world is enmity with god we want to please the world instead of pleasing god and we want to go along with this spirit amen that exists as though it's all right it's not all right are you with me the children are being taught in school it's all right on your job you got to put up with it everywhere you go in the churches the preachers have to put up with it all you look man so they are making accommodation for these spirits to take over the church and to take over the world but it's got to be that way so you can't get around and you got to get out of here are you with me it's time for the rapture it's time to go you must prepare yourself to take flight in the sage praise god don't prepare yourself to stay around here and you have to quote with this you have to put up with all this your children have to be victimized are you a man you must escape the pollution that is in the world amen this is an illusion that comes from lust praise god their purpose in this job their imagination is continually evil praise god we don't want to say that praise god but though the spirits it's not the individual it's the spirits that we're dealing with praise god the person themselves god hates sin but he loves the sinner are you with me so you got to realize that a difference between that person and the spirit that men have control over their lives so you don't come against the individual you come against that spirit are you a man and that spirit don't want you to cast them out because that spirit is no match for the word are you with me so you say what the words say praise god you're not going to be popular now praise god you're going to go through some persecution but stay with the word amen you'll lose friends and you lose loved ones but stay with the word praise god the word is not popular but it'll suck the sin of freedom amen it'll heal the broken heart it'll bring deliverance and peace to that soul that looking for happiness and satisfaction god word of given that it's only through jesus christ can we have that peace because he is that prince of peace y'all want me to stop i gotta stop god is good i gotta start y'all love the lord this morning i told brother charles i'm gonna give him a few minutes to you know just bring a little something to us this morning glad for brother charles huggins being with us this morning come on up brother charles and speak to us for a few minutes praise god i know he's he can say a whole lot and a little bit of time so by the grace of god let's receive come on up here first of all i thank god for the word of god lord jesus christ thank god for the man of god amen amen and and in second corinthians chapter four i mean corinthians chapter 10 the bible says amen uh casting down imaginations and i thank god amen and the way you cast it down you take that thought because there's a fallen thought that's why the bible says every thought that will exalt itself you know and you just use the name of jesus against it just like the man of god was saying and and you know the enemy is running run shad but greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world and we can do all things through christ who strengthens us and as we arm ourselves with the whole arm of god by you know uh meditating in the word of god you know uh studying the word of god you know oftentimes you know we'll you know we'll sing the word we hear songs got the word in it but there's nothing like you and i are taking our time daily you know and the enemy this is what i've learned the enemy will fight you and me we can be talking about sports we can be talking about going to the restaurant going shopping anybody can bother but the moment you and i talk about i'm going to spend some time with god look like eric the phone started ringing people get to want to talk to you call you up you say i haven't heard from this person you know because the bible says he comes for the word he don't come for you he comes for the word once he gets the word from getting to you then he got you and that's why the bible says amen be strong in the lord and in the power of his might and the way we are strong in the lord amen as we continually for this is what i used to do every day hallelujah before the lord uh you know when i gave my life to god i used to sit and say uh like for instance philippians 4 uh 13. i can do all things of christ who strengthens me i can do all things with christ and strengthens me i can do all things with christ strengthen me i can do all things with christ strengthen me i can do all things christ's turn to me and then all of a sudden it got good to me i'm getting i can do all things with christ i can do i can do i can do now as i start doing this here the word from my mind it began now to drench in my heart and then it begin to take root and once the word of god takes root then you see the fruit no root no fruit you see that's why jesus said you know the tree by the fruit at best so but if i don't put no word in there then i'll be like that man in the bible that the bible say when the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking through dry places seeking rest and fight if none but when he come back he finds that that house is swept garnish and clean but it's two ingredients it's not there he see that that person they save they clean they love the lord but there's two ingredients that's not there in that house the word of god amen and the power of the holy ghost that's why that's why that unclean spirit said i know what i do i'll go get seven others worse than me and that's what and that's what and so what are you saying when a person when a brother or sister in christ give his or her life to the lord jesus christ and then they begin to not put the word not feed on the word just like we eat natural food for our nurturement and body for vitamin c and so forth we need to eat the word of god that's why david said oh taste and see that the lord is good psalms 119 verse 9 david said wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way that's a question then he answered by taking heed according to thy word verse 10 thy word have i hid in my heart that what that i might not sin against thee so we got to familiarize ourselves and do it amen just just like you if you're running track i used to run track and field you know the 440 to 880 mile medley you know so it became it's an exercise i mean i read the word amen 10 hours 11 hours you know and trenching myself people you say man he's going to go crazy no you ain't a little you're going to go wise see the enemy what you what she called crazy is making you wise under salvation amen that's why i see remember it's always the opposite the enemy will never tell you he'll always say no don't do that god know that when you do that you're going to be like him it was already like him you see he's a deceiver and a liar but the thing that god showed me in genesis and i didn't see this i always used to see how the woman saw the tree with good food but then the lord showed me something that i didn't really and and pastor said it a little while ago purpose and desire god is not going to overrule mind or your desire because the bible says in revelation 22 17 whosoever will whosoever will let him come what are you saying you can ask a child to sit down the child will sit down but in his heart or her heart guess what they standing up they did it obediently but what they weren't willing you you see there and that's why we got to love it i would never let me tell you something i grew up in in chicago in gangs and stuff and and and you know my i used to hear my mom she said and my sister name because they first got saved and then come on go to church child someone i ain't i don't want to do with that stuff you know and i didn't and the thing i'm going to tell you something that really turned me off when i would see one thing them in church and i see them living enough you know we got to be examples and god taught me you know be an example don't be no hypocrite don't be phony don't be a pretender or an actor you see and i thank god amen i thank god hallelujah for how he's made me because if i can be in darkness crazy and foolish and wild and strong and and what we call fearless before uh the people doing wrong how much more on the light side you understand i'm saying in other words not fearing you know people looking so look at them gangs over there look at them you know if god can save me and i was in a gang he could say that other gang man i remember talking to a mem uh minister into a muslim this is what the muslim said to me i want to pay close attention and also listen to the wisdom of god how the response that he got to he said you see all them hypocrites over there and that's what i said to him i said what are you looking for i want somebody was real i said why don't you become what you're looking for and you'll become your best example he he uh uh no no no you become what you're looking for it shed his mouth he said and guess what two weeks later i'll never forget in the church service in the system why because i was in prison he ended up coming there sitting in the back and then next you know i see him come up to the altar and give his life to jesus god wants to see and the bible says be able to answer every man the hope of the calling in you i don't care if they muslim i used to admit to muslim rastafarians five percenters god bodies wicked or devil worshipers even the chapel i never forget they had a chaplain come and he starts saying well you know jesus was just like tarzan and i had all the brothers i said i stood up i stood up because the other brothers in christ they just sitting there letting them talk i said what did you say i chill mouth mister just this just why i dressed him what did you see at your mouth mister first of all the lord jesus christ is lord of lord and king of kings how are you going to associate him with with some uh television thing on tv and when i said those words he got quiet tarts turning red and pink in the face and the other brothers uh brother charles said hey no brother charles where's your backbone you don't let nobody degrade what you believe in do you think do you think that do you think that if you go on a mosque with the muslims you think they're going to let you disrespect them no they're not they're going to even though they're wrong but they're going to stand up and in psalms 94 16 it says who will stand up for me against the evildoers and who will rise up for me against the workers of iniquity we got amen we got to stand amen we can't be afraid god did not give us the spirit of fear but power love and a sound mind or a well-disciplined mind amen so we've got to have a conviction we have to have a conviction and a commitment say lord i'm going to do i don't care where to go because for you i'll live and for you i'll die jesus said if we he that will save his life he'll lose it but if we'll lose our life for the lord jesus christ he said we'll pick it back up he told them when they said i take your life jesus said you don't take my life guess what i lay it down and i'm able to pick it back up again [Laughter] you know you know when you when you know whose you are and who you are you don't fear nobody you don't fear nobody and i'm saying be you know men and women of god young people god loves us be strong in the lord in the power of his might because strong in that word amen if regardless of what they saying to your school they may laugh at you come on she ain't like us you got that right she don't supposed to be like you he ain't like us he don't supposed to be like you when we are different we make a difference don't ever get dead by being different you make a difference but if you just like everybody else then guess what the world loves its own but because you are not of the world and jesus called us out of the world therefore the world hate us but we love them god bless you praise the lord [Applause] appreciate brother charles amen praise god god is good amen let us stand tonight day amen we're in a battle thanks it's going home time you got to fight the good fight of faith to
