His popularity started going down. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the point that uh it got so low that u he had 75 ministers with him and and then one day he told him, he said, "Except you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you don't have no life in you."

Ephesians the 2 chapter. And we're going to be reading uh starting in verse uh 8, Ephesians 2 and verse eight. And if you can stand, stand. Amen. And we stand at the pledge of allegiance. Let's stand to give honor to the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians the 2 chapter and verse 8. For by grace are you saved through faith, &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of works least any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Let church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lesson that we're going to preach today is well, the workmanship of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the book of Revelation, the third chapter. Revelations 3. Then I'm going to let you be seated. Revelations the 3rd chapter and verse 14. And unto the angel of the church of the leadyans, write these things saith thee, amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. Let us pray. Father, we thank you today, Lord. We thank you Lord for this love letter called the Bible. Lord, we give your name the praise and the honor and all the glory. Father, because we know that you are Jehovah Shama. You're the God that's present. And you are Jehovah Gyra, the God that provides all of our sacrifice, all of our needs. So, Father, we give this service over into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you. Let's just say amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated. &gt;&gt; So, just to kind of get you on the same page of where we are as far as workmanship. Amen. Workmanship. Uh the word workmanship means that which is made, a work of art. It refers to a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. What Paul is saying is that all God's children are his masterpieces. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody looked at somebody and said, "Hello, uh, brother, sister, masterpiece." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Come on. Say it with enthusiasm. Hello, brother. Masterpiece. Give the Lord a hack praise. Amen. Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew definition of workmanship is um it refers to a new creation &gt;&gt; that God has made in Christ. Emphasizing that believers are the product of God's creative work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In the Greek, it's an idea of something brought into being through a creative process. Amen. So in Ephesians the second chapter, it emphasizes that Christians are not just saved by grace but also transformed into something new, &gt;&gt; something uh God actively created and designed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Believers are his masterpiece, &gt;&gt; carefully crafted and shaped for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; Let her say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let her say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how many believe that salvation is all of God? &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that ain't nothing you can do to save yourself? &gt;&gt; And how many know Jesus did it all? &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Jesus did it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are the workmanship of the master sculptor. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'll just drop this one. It's on my mind. And God's servant William Brandon preached a lesson on masterpiece. Amen. If you if you follow this message, you know that he came out of Isaiah 53rd chapter. Amen. Where the Lord Jesus was marred and bruised. Uh, Amen. and for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; And he was uh talking about Michelangelo's effort to uh sculpt out Moses. Amen. And how that they didn't have any pictures of Moses. So he had an image in his mind of Moses. Amen. And he worked on that marvel and and rubbed on it and chipped on it and until such time that that statue uh reflected what was in his mind. And when it when it became the reality of what he was thinking in his mind became real in front of him, inspiration struck him and he smoked the statue on his knee. And a piece came off his knee and he cried out, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Why? Because what was in his mind now came into reality. And it was so real &gt;&gt; that he decided that that thing ought to be able to speak. Yes. &gt;&gt; Let church say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; And when he smoked it, &gt;&gt; that piece came off of that statue. &gt;&gt; God's servant said that's what made it the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; The stroke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The piece that fell off of it is what made it the masterpiece. How many know today that we are God's people and God is the great uh I want to call him a sculter but I want to I want to use these terms potter. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible in the book of Psalms 139 said I will praise thee for I'm filthully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Curiously wrought. That word wrought it it means to be beaten. &gt;&gt; Amen. Into shape. How many thank God today that that's the way we were &gt;&gt; when we were out there in the world. Amen. Doing our thing. And I don't know about y'all, but I was out there doing my thing. And I know many of y'all was out there doing your thing, too. But how many know that God saw you when you were not perfect? &gt;&gt; Come on. How many know God saw you when you was out there doing your thing? Glory to God. And and he watched over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he intervened in in your thing that you was doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he caused you to come at the appointed time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he protected you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He protected you from all hurt, harm, and danger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had something in his mind. &gt;&gt; He was working on you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He had you on that potter's wheel. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He put you on the potter's wheel. &gt;&gt; Amen. He turned you and he was shaping you and molding you. Glory to God. Hallelujah. and everything that was going on with you, he had his hands on it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are fearfully &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were made in secret &gt;&gt; and wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I say a lot of times to the people in Aken to kind of get them a little bit uh off their guard. I said Jackson was lower than a worm. Lower than a worm. I share this little story here. I said my wife, bless her heart, um she came from a holiness uh uh tradition. Amen. They they went and when they went to church, they tear it for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then they they prayed through. Amen. I didn't do that. Amen. My daddy was my granddaddy was a preacher, Baptist preacher. Uh I came up to a Baptist tradition and um and I was out there in the world doing my thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to tell you all that I was doing because I don't want you to hold all that dirt on me. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But one day I had inspiration to go to church and me and my buddies went to church at Second Nazareth Baptist Church and they decided to go and get baptized. And I decided to go get baptized, too. Amen. I said, "My buddy's getting baptized. I'm going to get baptized, too." But, you know, it wasn't no conversion. It wasn't no conversion. And when I went and got baptized, I went down a dry silt and came up a wet one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know ain't none of y'all done nothing like that. But one thing about it, and I just say this, when I got baptized and the preacher said, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." When I got done, came up out the water, it was a question in my mind. What is the name? &gt;&gt; What is the name? &gt;&gt; And that followed me all the time I stayed in that church. And and and I I won't go I won't go long on this. Is that all right? Cuz I'm looking at that clock up there. But [Laughter] &gt;&gt; but Fred, I was sitting I was sitting out in the audience one day when the preacher was preaching and all of a sudden a voice started speaking to me. I didn't know nothing about spiritual things but that voice told me he said, "Look at your preacher up there." He got on his, you know, preacher coat and his turn round collar and long robes and everything. And the voice spoke to me. He said, "If the Roman Catholics get in, y'all will too. That's what the voice said to me. From that time, I left that church. I didn't know why I left that church. And I and and and don't don't don't you know it was no spiritual journey. Um but it was a journey out of hypocrisy into total complete chaos. Amen. Cuz I made it up in my mind I wasn't going to be no hypocrite. I'm going to sit up in there and play like I'm I'm churched and and know in my heart that I'm still in the world. &gt;&gt; So I decided I'm going to go 110% in the world. Randy and I went out in the world and by the grace of God &gt;&gt; God kept me &gt;&gt; from all her harm and danger. &gt;&gt; I was curiously wrought &gt;&gt; in the lowest &gt;&gt; points of this earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you all the things that I did. Uh because that ain't none of y'all business. &gt;&gt; God knows what I did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I I'll say this. I'll say this. I wouldn't go but so far &gt;&gt; because something was there influencing me. &gt;&gt; Something was there keeping me from going, you know, all the way &gt;&gt; uh all the way where my other buddies was going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, so what did God do? God let me meet that Holy Ghost firebaptized person called Kathleen Bolton. Holy Ghost filled fire baptized. Here I am out in the world. Now you say, was it a spiritual attraction? No. I was out there playing basketball in Latimma Mana. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. thought I could play too. Playing basketball and all of a sudden something came walking up the street. I said, "My God, who is that? Who is it?" One of my buddies said, "That's Kathleen Bolton." I said, "My God, I need to meet that child. &gt;&gt; Is this all right?" &gt;&gt; One of my buddies, Larry Ball, he said, "I know her. I'll take you and introduce her to you." Oh, by the way, she lived two doors down from you. I said, "What?" went met her. And to fast forward from that time, I was never the same. I was never the same. And I didn't know. I thought it was a physical attraction. It was, but it was more than that. &gt;&gt; It was more than that because um they used to have prayer meetings under underneath the house. Ba, did you ever go to them them prayer meetings underneath the house? Oh, you did? I can. I don't know whether I can believe that, but said underneath the house it was prophesied that she was going to marry a preacher, but she didn't. She married me. Now, I I'm using up a lot of my time to say this, but I'm trying to get it over to you that God works his wonders &gt;&gt; even when you don't know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen. &gt;&gt; God works his wonders &gt;&gt; even when you don't know it. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I was getting into. She thought she had married a devil. She actually told me that. &gt;&gt; She told me. She said, "I'd made a mistake. I married a devil and I was supposed to marry a preacher." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God was working. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that? Say amen. She didn't know. But God was working on me. And and and the fast forward, long story short, um the Lord kept me through all types of things in the military. I was a military officer. I thought it was the God's gift to women. Don't y'all go out and tell anybody listening. Oh, it's on video, is it? I thought I was God's gift to women. Kathleen there, my blessed faithful wife. on my dick like a fool. But the Lord kept us together. You know how it wasn't on her account cuz she would have left me a long time ago. But it was her mama. Her mama, Miss Pay, she said, "You ain't leaving that boy." Because when you marry him, you marry him for life. &gt;&gt; So you just suck it up. You stuck with him for life. And I thank God for Miss Payne because my wife stuck with me through thick and thin. Come on, give God praise. Come on, give God praise. Amen. And she was praying for me. I knew she was praying for me. And then at the appointed time, God called me. Amen. and and and and you know sometimes things happen in your life where you don't know why they happening but what it is God's got you on that potter's wheel. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's working on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's he's molding and shaping you through the events that take place in your life. &gt;&gt; And what event happened in my life was that I was up in Michigan, Midland, Michigan. My daddy died. My rock died. Amen. And I'm on a plane going home to his funeral. And that same voice that spoke to me in that Baptist church, it spoke to me. And it said even before I decided to to go home, it said, "Go home, my son, and help. Go home and help." I thought, for Simmons, I thought I was um pretty smart fell. I thought I was supposed to go home and become a lawyer. Amen. And I thought I was supposed to go home and call a lawyer. But that voice spoke to me and told me to go home in hell. And what did he do? As I was down there by that casket crying my hearts out about losing my daddy, he spoke to me again. And what did he say? I am your daddy now. How many thank God today for the voice of God. Oh, somebody give him praise. The Lord spoke to me and said, I am your daddy. I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; But it it took something it took a visitation of the spirit of God to uh to really work on me. And how did that happen? It happened uh through God supernaturally giving me a job in in South Carolina. And the first person I saw was a Holy Ghost filled firebaptized preacher by the name of Charles Anderson. Amen. He walked in Caroline Eastman come in with his Bible in his arm. He wasn't ashamed of the gospel at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when I came in, he took me on as a project. Amen. I wasn't too stirred about no Bible study in my house. I really wasn't. I had a pool table in my basement and I had my big buddies coming over. We drink beer and shoot pool. Brother Anderson said, "I want I want I want to come talk to you." That brother came in the station wagon with the pool pit in the back and brought it and set it up in my living room and we had church in the house. &gt;&gt; What was going on? God &gt;&gt; was working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His mysterious work. &gt;&gt; Amen. And while I was in the lowest parts of the earth, &gt;&gt; he had me on that potter's wheel. Give him praise today. Amen. Oh, somebody give him praise. Somebody say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. We were dwelling in the Lord's possible direction. We were sinners in the flesh and needed to be broken. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We needed to be broken. We needed our eyes enlightened to the anointing that was dealing with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it wasn't for the grace of God, I would have went on like that and wasted my whole life. &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; but God, &gt;&gt; somebody say, "But God, &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; who's rich in mercy." &gt;&gt; Amen. Saw it fit to reveal himself to me. &gt;&gt; And how many thank God today that God saw it fit to reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen. Somebody give me praise today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when he reveals himself to you, &gt;&gt; he puts you on that partner's will. &gt;&gt; Spins that will and begin to shape and mold you. &gt;&gt; What does he do? He allows the experiences in your life to mold &gt;&gt; to shape you. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank you for the trials." Somebody say, "Thank you, Lord, for the trials that you let me go through." Hallelujah. You did not leave me. You did not forsake me. You were with me all the while. Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Come on, shout praise the Lord. You were there all the while. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Our lives needed to be broke. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah said, "Rise and let's go down to the potter's house." &gt;&gt; And there I will cause thee to hear my words. &gt;&gt; And then I went down to the potter's house. And behold, he wrought a work on the wheels, &gt;&gt; and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in his hand. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What did he do when he had us in our in his hands? &gt;&gt; And and we weren't living up to standards. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did he kick us aside? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he throw us aside and just discard us? &gt;&gt; No. He what he did was &gt;&gt; he broke it and then he put it back on the wheel &gt;&gt; to make it another vessel. &gt;&gt; How many thank God today that God rich in mercy he broke you but he put you back on the wheel. How many thank God for that today? Come on. How many thank God today? &gt;&gt; Somebody say please &gt;&gt; say it with me. Please &gt;&gt; be patient with me. &gt;&gt; Be patient with me. &gt;&gt; God. God &gt;&gt; is not through with me yet. &gt;&gt; He is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But when God &gt;&gt; But when God &gt;&gt; get through with me, &gt;&gt; with me, &gt;&gt; I'm going to come forth &gt;&gt; like pure gold. &gt;&gt; How many feel that way today? &gt;&gt; Come on. How many feel that way today? Come on. How many really believe that that's your journey in life? that God is going to put you on the part of his will, mold you and shape you. &gt;&gt; But after he gets you into that image that he wants to see, &gt;&gt; he puts you in the fire. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He throws you in the fire. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's something else needs to be purified &gt;&gt; out of your life. &gt;&gt; So he allows you to go through a fiery trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when the potter allows us to go through the trials, sometimes we get a little bit discouraged. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank that he done left us, but you don't realize that the potter got his eyes on you. Glory to God. He knows what he got in store for you. I &gt;&gt; I'm Randy back there. Stand up, Randy. Stand up, Randy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't he look like a big healthy man. &gt;&gt; A big healthy man. &gt;&gt; But how many know what about a year ago, Randy? It's about a year ago. &gt;&gt; Seven months ago, Randy got shot with a 45. And I got I got a 45 bullet back there. I thought I was going to bring out and let you look at is a big bullet. Shot eight times &gt;&gt; with a 45. &gt;&gt; Randy shouldn't be standing there. &gt;&gt; Randy should not be standing there. [Music] &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; had him on the pot as well. Amen. And had somebody praying for him. And God performed miracle upon miracle upon miracle upon miracle upon him. And now he's standing there as a testimony that God the master potter is able to keep us. Glory to God. God is able. You can be seated around. Give God praise today. Amen. Give God praise today. Amen. Give him praise today. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the potter. &gt;&gt; We're the clay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, like the potter Jeremiah was going down the pot to be broke up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me say this. If you don't allow yourself to get broken, &gt;&gt; you never can be made over. &gt;&gt; A lot of time folk carrying all this pride and and all of this made us and &gt;&gt; and all these thoughts. &gt;&gt; God want to break you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is not breaking you to destroy you. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded something God's servant said. It's about this little lamb. Amen. He's a shepherd. And this little lamb wouldn't pay no attention to what he had to say to him. So what did he do? He took the little lamb and broke both his legs. You said, "That's a that's a mean shepherd, isn't it? That would break the lamb's legs." Amen. That's a mean shepherd, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But he knew what he was going to do. Somebody asked him, "Why did you do that? Why'd you break the lamb's legs? He said, "Because I want to give it special attention. I'm going to put it on my shoulders and I'm going to uh uh take care of it." Amen. I'm going to give it special attention so that when it gets well, it will know my love better than when it did when it was out there cutting a fool. How many thank the Lord today that that's what God does with us. Amen. When we act like we know it all, &gt;&gt; act like we can't be taught. &gt;&gt; God, let something break you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that he can give you special attention. &gt;&gt; So that he can show you his love. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody give him praise before I get there. &gt;&gt; But it was a lady uh before I get there. But it was a lady uh was a relative of brother singingly and sister singing actually it's is poti was uh s singly sister and I don't know what stage of cancer she had it might have been what is the fourth stage of cancer is that the large is that the most critical stage well she was in the hospital and and uh doctor was saying ain't nothing more they could do for her and they were basically giving given up on her. And um make a long story short, uh succinctly went to the hospital and and when she went there, she was in bad shape. You know how cancer patients had all that pain and they groaning and and moaning and Amen. And it's almost like it's a little lost cause. She quietly went in the room behind her and while she was groaning, she just called her name Poti. And then all of a sudden, Poti said, "Tiny." She stopped groaning and moaning and she said, "Tiny." Things begin to change. They came to church that Sunday and said pray for Poti because the cancer done took over and you know about taken out. We had prayer at the front of the church and um that was over a week ago. The testimony that we got I got got it Thursday night of this week. I I guess that was this Thursday gone that the doctors checked out Poti and they declared her cancer free. &gt;&gt; What the potter &gt;&gt; the potter &gt;&gt; is allowing us to go through the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. to show &gt;&gt; that he's in control. &gt;&gt; Somebody shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Lord, have your way in my life." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Have your way, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You are the potter. &gt;&gt; We're the claim. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We read Revelation the 3rd chapter in verse 14 &gt;&gt; and it reads and unto the angel of the church of the le of sins. Write these things sayaith the amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's who the Lord Jesus say. He is the beginning &gt;&gt; of the creation &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; But those words don't mean exactly as they sound. &gt;&gt; You say the words don't mean what it sound. No, just taking them the way they sound. It make people think or get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God, making him lower than Godhead. Then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains. But that's not right. That doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible &gt;&gt; because the words really mean this. He is the beginner or the author of the creation of God. Come on. How many How many understand what I'm saying? Say amen. &gt;&gt; He's the author of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that in John 1:3 the Bible says all things were made by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And without him was any not anything made that was made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that was said in Genesis 1:1, in the beginning God created the heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in Exodus 2011, for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt that our Lord Jesus is the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was the creator of a finished physical creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can see by these words, what these words mean to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God. And how can God be created when himself he is the creator? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now I'm going I'm going to bring it home now. I'm going to bring it home. So now in our day, in the worst church age there is, a church age that he rebuked and said that it was blind, naked, miserable, and don't even know it. That's right. in the final uh closing church age. He made that statement standing in the midst of the church. He stands there revealing himself as the author of the creation of God in the darkest hour that the world will see. Now I got your attention. So in this dark hour, he's declaring that he's creating something in this dark hour. This is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Let say amen. &gt;&gt; It's different from the original creation. The Bible in 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter and verse 17 says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation." Let her say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Old things have what? Passed away. Behold, what? All things have become new. &gt;&gt; How many in here today are in Christ Jesus? &gt;&gt; Come on. How many of today are in the revealed word for your day? &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what does it is that new creation is inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any man be in Christ, he's a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Old things have what? &gt;&gt; Passed away. Behold what? &gt;&gt; All things are become new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you still holding on to some of them old things, you need to get in Christ. If you still holding on to temper, you need to get in Christ. &gt;&gt; If you still holding on to selfishness, you need to get in Christ &gt;&gt; because all those old things pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're in the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the creative power of God is working on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen. Oh, somebody give him praise. Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Oh my God. This is another creation. &gt;&gt; This has to do with the church. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; A special designation of himself. &gt;&gt; He is the creator of that church. &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom is creating himself a bride. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that I can say that I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, somebody say it with me. I'm so glad. I'm glad &gt;&gt; I can say &gt;&gt; I can say &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. And I I I I know that God's people um haven't been brought into a channel where they understand the grace that God has poured out upon us in this hour. We understand intellectually, but have it been quickened to us on who we really are? &gt;&gt; Amen. When those seals was breaking and that seven churches messenger was addressing the church, he said, "I don't call you no more church. I call you bride." &gt;&gt; Why? Because only the bride is going to know the deep secrets of the father. Only those whose names were in the book of life from the foundation of the world are going to have ears to hear what the spirit is saying in this day. And I don't know about you today, but I thank God that I can say that I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; And by having ears to hear, by having ears to hear, by having ears to hear that word, you have passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It shows that eternal life is inside of your body. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you today, but I'm getting old. Amen. I I I'll be 73 my birthday. And I thank God to know that I got that treasure of eternal life in my body. Amen. Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Somebody shout praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I don't have to be afraid of death. Death, where is your strength? Grave, where is your victory? Thanks be to God that's given me the victory even in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Somebody shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has appeared [Applause] &gt;&gt; in our day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I thought, brother Simmons, I was going to preach on the the pool of Calvary. How many know the Lord Jesus said in St. John the 12th chapter, he said this? He said, "If I be lifted up, &gt;&gt; I will draw all men unto myself, unto me." What was he lifted up at? At the cross. At the cross is where he was lifted up. So what came out of the cross? What came out of the cross is a pull an attraction. Amen. To draw the predestinated seed to himself. Let us say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. At first Paul healing ministry healed many. But did that change their hearts? No. Did not change the hearts. God manifested that first pull in the in the service of the ministry all over the world. Multitudes of people were healed. But did that change their hearts? &gt;&gt; No. Second pull came discernment. Amen. Showing uh things that happened in their lives that's hindering them from moving on with God. Amen. That happened multitudes of times. Did that change the heart? No. Actually, it caused doors to close on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that Holy Ghost, that light would come into the room and begin to show things. Amen. Not only did it show hindrance of healing, but it showed also demonic spirits that's working in the religious realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what did it do? It caused doors to close on them. But the third pull, let's just say the third pull. &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's changing the hearts. That's what's changing the heart. That's what's converting the hearts. That's what's cleansing the heart. That's what's producing a bride &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; The revealing of the mystery secrets of God. &gt;&gt; It's what's changing the hearts. How many thank God today that you are the recipients of that third pull? &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise today, man. Come on, give him praise. Somebody give him praise. Somebody say, "Thank you, Jesus." Another creation. And that's what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By revealing himself in those seals, what is it doing? It's it's it's causing a pull to pull us not to the holy place, &gt;&gt; but pulling us behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the presence of Shakana glory. &gt;&gt; In the presence of that light. In the presence of that pillar of fire that came into his ministry. That's where the bride is abiding. &gt;&gt; Underneath the shadows of his wings. &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that breaks every yoke. &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that raises the dead. &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that heals the sick. Underneath the anointing that changes the seat of the affections of our heart. Why? It's the creative power of God. &gt;&gt; Let church say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God created the universe by his spoken word. [Music] &gt;&gt; He created the universe by his spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now in this day, he's creating a new creation of people &gt;&gt; by his spoken word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember in Genesis 1 when he got done creating the uh original creation, he made this statement. Not only is this good, but it's very good. &gt;&gt; How many thank God today that God is speaking the same thing in our day &gt;&gt; for those have received this revealed word and really received it in their hearts. What is he saying? He's the author of a new creation of people. And what is he saying about them? They're not only good, but they are very good. Oh, reach over to somebody and say, "Hello, new creation." &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say it like with authority. Hello, new creation. &gt;&gt; Hello, new creation. &gt;&gt; You are very good. &gt;&gt; You are very good. &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise today. Amen. You are not good, but you are what? &gt;&gt; Very good. Let shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, are we the sons of God? &gt;&gt; The only message there is on the face of the earth that can manifest the true sons and daughters of God. It's this message of Malachi 4. That's the only message. It ain't going to be no uh you ain't going to be falling over one another. It's going to be a small group of people that's going to receive it. Amen. But I thank God that I'm speaking to uh a group of people that have received the message shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen.
