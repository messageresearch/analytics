[43:46] you read the next we'll read the last
[43:48] verse together
[43:49] God is good amen
[43:52] it's kind of quiet this morning but God
[43:55] is good
[43:57] amen
[43:59] so glad to be in the number one more
[44:01] time
[44:02] as we end coming to the end of the year
[44:05] thank God it's time is passing
[44:10] so fast
[44:14] the Earth is shaking it's moving the
[44:16] earthquakes and every kind of thing
[44:18] that's happening is happening
[44:22] not the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[44:25] this wise wind as his mother Mary was
[44:28] espoused to Joseph before they came
[44:31] together she was found with the child of
[44:34] the Holy Ghost 19.
[44:46] but while he thought on these things
[44:48] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[44:51] unto him in a dream and saying Joseph
[44:53] thy son of David fear not to take unto
[44:56] the demarried our wife for that which is
[45:00] conceived in her is
[45:03] of the Holy Ghost 21.
[45:14] and now all this was done that it might
[45:18] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[45:21] Lord by the prophet saying
[45:35] then Joseph being
[45:39] rise raised from the Sleep rise from
[45:42] sleep did as the angel of the Lord has
[45:46] bitten him and took unto him his wife
[45:50] together and knew her not to she bought
[45:54] forth the firstborn son and he called
[45:58] his name Jesus may God bless you with
[46:01] each word and you may be
[46:04] now
[46:06] had this been in our day
[46:09] I guess it would have been a laughing
[46:11] stock she would have been a reproach she
[46:15] would have been one if she would have
[46:16] told her testimony
[46:18] who would have believed that testimony
[46:22] we're talking about a child of the Holy
[46:24] Ghost
[46:26] now as it
[46:28] [Music]
[46:29] bought about
[46:32] something that looked like a report
[46:35] approach and a shame
[46:38] so it is today
[46:40] with a Christian a child of the Holy
[46:43] Ghost
[46:46] somebody sung a song that the word could
[46:49] be born in Mary surely the word can be
[46:51] born In You and I
[46:54] if Jesus Christ the word
[46:59] could be born in Mary
[47:04] now the Bible tells us as newborn babies
[47:07] is out of Center milk of the word that
[47:09] they might grow thereby and then it
[47:11] talks about Christ to be informed in US
[47:15] we know Jesus Christ was being formed in
[47:19] Mary
[47:20] Christ is being formed in you and I
[47:24] amen
[47:26] now as we look at Luke 1 and 30.
[47:31] a child of the Holy Ghost
[47:36] I guess this is a reproach it's uh it
[47:40] seems something very
[47:41] uh
[47:43] mysterious and miraculous and it it it's
[47:47] beyond our comprehensions our minds
[47:49] cannot concede
[47:51] and neither can the world understand
[47:53] what it means to be born again
[47:58] the new birth and to be born again it's
[48:01] so odd amen even to the religious world
[48:04] into the church world it's an odd thing
[48:07] to be born again to be uh uh the new
[48:11] birth to be a new creature all of that
[48:13] to just uh it seems like strange
[48:15] babbling you you hear the terminology
[48:18] but amen it's no reality to the
[48:21] terminology
[48:23] because people are are just traditional
[48:26] Believers like it was in that day people
[48:29] were amen supposed to be God's children
[48:32] and they're supposed to be believing in
[48:34] God but when amen the word was
[48:36] manifested in their day amen they didn't
[48:39] want to receive it
[48:41] so today is the word amen comes amen and
[48:45] it comes off the pages because it and
[48:48] then it becomes reality and it gets on
[48:50] two feet people don't want to receive it
[48:54] because they think it's impossible for
[48:56] something like that to happen
[48:58] even though the word had testified of it
[49:01] in Isaiah 7 14. isn't that right
[49:05] even though it was in their Bible and
[49:08] they were Bible Believers yet they could
[49:11] not receive they can receive it as long
[49:13] as if it's on the pages of the book but
[49:16] if it got on two feet they could not
[49:18] receive it
[49:20] are you with me
[49:22] and uh people can receive you as you
[49:25] saying I'm born again and I'm a
[49:28] Christian I I have the new birth they
[49:31] can receive you talking about it amen
[49:33] but when it actually is a reality and it
[49:37] walks on two feet most of the people
[49:40] will say who Do You Think You Are
[49:43] are you with me
[49:45] and that's the reason why Paul says I'm
[49:49] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[49:50] Christ because it is of the power of God
[49:53] it's a Salvation unto everyone to
[49:55] believe
[49:56] but you know most people that claim to
[50:00] have be born again or have the new birth
[50:02] there's no change in them
[50:04] [Music]
[50:05] there's no different from what they were
[50:08] amen before they claimed the new birth
[50:11] it meant they still act the same to live
[50:14] the same they talk the same they walk
[50:16] the same
[50:18] but if if reality amen uh strikes a
[50:23] person it began to manifest itself amen
[50:26] then you began to see amen as Christ
[50:30] came he was the son of God Amen
[50:33] the only begotten of the father isn't
[50:36] that right
[50:36] he was the Son of God the purpose of him
[50:39] coming that he might save you and I and
[50:42] that we also might become Sons and
[50:45] Daughters of God isn't that right
[50:47] and to be a son and daughter of God then
[50:50] we must have the same characteristics
[50:53] amen and we must have the same
[50:55] attributes of our father
[50:58] not only shall we look like him we
[51:00] should walk like him talk like him and
[51:02] act like him
[51:03] amen because we are what he wants
[51:07] are you with me because amen the church
[51:10] is born of his born flesh of his flesh
[51:13] amen the church in him are one because
[51:16] we came out from him as Eve was a part
[51:19] of Adam's Soul he meant the church was a
[51:22] part of God
[51:24] amen praise God Jesus amen was the head
[51:27] and the maximum amen the church is the
[51:30] body and The Feminine
[51:32] amen so what the heck done the body
[51:35] should do
[51:37] are you with me
[51:38] so if the body is not doing what the
[51:41] hell did then it is is it the body of
[51:44] Christ
[51:46] amen so in this day we should see Jesus
[51:49] Christ but he should be in broad form
[51:53] are you a man
[51:55] so amen because when the marriage take
[51:58] place the marriage of the Lamb amen the
[52:01] husband and the wife cannot be amen
[52:04] married unless and they are equally yoke
[52:07] are you up there
[52:10] so we must become one with him
[52:12] [Music]
[52:14] he said there are no more Twain but they
[52:17] are
[52:17] they're one isn't that right
[52:20] so Luke 1 and 30. so by the grace of God
[52:23] we
[52:24] going a little fast getting ahead of
[52:26] myself in the story but a child of the
[52:30] Holy Ghost
[52:31] I'm gonna tell you something the Holy
[52:33] Ghost makes a difference in your life
[52:35] it's not you know
[52:37] sometimes I I didn't listen to different
[52:40] preachers and everybody talk about the
[52:43] message of the hour and the end time and
[52:45] all that
[52:47] they bring the people to
[52:49] look like uh something that don't have
[52:52] any power in it
[52:56] are you with me
[52:59] they talk about it and look like they
[53:02] misrepresented
[53:04] they try to impersonate it amen but I
[53:07] said amen uh See Jesus Christ you can't
[53:11] impersonate the word like
[53:14] because the word is the seed of God
[53:17] are you with me
[53:19] praise God you cannot deceive the word
[53:23] amen
[53:24] the Bible said the woman Adam was not
[53:27] deceived but the woman was deceived
[53:29] being in the transgression
[53:31] see in order for you not to be deceived
[53:34] you've got to be seed
[53:37] are you up man
[53:38] so if you're not the word in that you
[53:42] can't be deceived but if you were the
[53:43] word amen then you've been born again
[53:46] not a corruptible seed but incorruptible
[53:50] by the word of God was a living and a
[53:53] body forever you are born of the word
[53:57] it's not a church it's not something
[53:59] that I just want to identify with it's
[54:02] not something I want to talk about it's
[54:04] a reality
[54:07] amen it's something that's real
[54:10] it's a life
[54:13] amen praise God
[54:17] oh Lord
[54:19] see because I
[54:20] it's it's something about all the talk
[54:23] and and the life is not there the
[54:26] manifestation that's something that
[54:28] people trying to make happen
[54:30] you don't have to try to make

[54:36] to drive hey hey hey sheep you supposed
[54:39] to grow wool hey hey
[54:43] are you up there
[54:47] you don't have to try to
[54:51] teach a bird to fly
[54:54] bird you're supposed to fly
[54:56] and you don't have to teach a fish how
[54:58] to swim
[55:00] are you with me
[55:02] it's Adam you don't have to even beat
[55:04] somebody over the head try to tell them

[55:09] you're supposed to do this use them on
[55:11] to do that no it's Adam
[55:15] are you up there
[55:17] there's something in me that makes me
[55:19] who I am

[55:24] has been shouted abroad in My Heart by
[55:26] the Holy Ghost I love him
[55:29] I don't have to be forced to come to
[55:31] church I don't have to be forced to
[55:33] giving praise I don't have to be forced
[55:35] to tell Lord I love you I'm not ashamed
[55:38] to say I love him

[1:22:39] you can see the devil still ruler
[1:22:42] all that they be doing
[1:22:45] you know you know how can God live
[1:22:49] inside
[1:22:50] something like what they doing
[1:22:53] taking all the people money
[1:22:56] dancing in the church
[1:22:58] cutting oh Lord doing all that
[1:23:01] foolishness
[1:23:02] are you with me
[1:23:05] we got to have come down to holiness
[1:23:08] be holy for I'm holy
[1:23:11] are you with me
[1:23:13] let's be real God is calling us to
[1:23:16] perfection
[1:23:17] we got to be like Jesus
[1:23:20] Our Father which is Heaven is perfect he
[1:23:22] said be you perfect
[1:23:24] are you with me read on
[1:23:26] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:23:29] his saying and casting her mind what man
[1:23:31] of salutation this should be now out of
[1:23:34] all the people in the world God chose
[1:23:36] you
[1:23:38] now she got to say
[1:23:44] I don't believe you
[1:23:46] and that's what happens when Jesus come
[1:23:48] to you as an individual it speaks to
[1:23:50] your heart it's whether or not you want
[1:23:52] to believe that it's God
[1:23:54] you might think the preachers preacher
[1:23:56] mama told me daddy told him but when God
[1:23:58] deals with you as an individual it ain't
[1:24:00] no mama daddy a preacher and then on
[1:24:02] church it's you as an individual God
[1:24:04] speaks to you as an individual
[1:24:06] and you his voice you know ah I had
[1:24:10] something talking through my head and
[1:24:11] something's telling me how to do right
[1:24:14] and all to live right I hear it all the
[1:24:16] time you know I get but somehow you
[1:24:20] ought to stop hearing it all the time
[1:24:21] you ought to listen
[1:24:24] listen to that inner person that's
[1:24:27] calling you that inner voice
[1:24:30] because something tell you don't do it
[1:24:31] wrong and something tell you go ahead on
[1:24:34] you know and if you want to do wrong you
[1:24:37] go do wrong because it what who you
[1:24:39] think telling you to do wrong
[1:24:42] who you think telling you to do right
[1:24:45] God the same voice God used to tell you
[1:24:48] to give your life to the Lord isn't that
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:50] all you gotta do is listen
[1:24:52] but we think angel I got to see an angel
[1:24:55] with a white anything could come with
[1:24:58] white robe and everything and light and
[1:25:01] tell you a lie
[1:25:03] and folks want that
[1:25:05] but they don't I'm gonna tell you so
[1:25:08] if you believe take it back to the Bible
[1:25:13] because an angel could tell a lie to you
[1:25:15] you can be a fallen angel
[1:25:16] but you got to go back and make sure
[1:25:18] that angel telling you what's written in
[1:25:19] the Bible
[1:25:21] are you with me
[1:25:22] I gotta close go ahead on killer and the
[1:25:25] angel said unto her fear not married for
[1:25:27] God has found favor with God and behold
[1:25:30] Thou shalt conceive and thy womb and
[1:25:32] bring forth the son and shall call his
[1:25:35] name Jesus and he shall be great and
[1:25:37] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:25:40] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:25:43] Throne of his father David and he shall
[1:25:45] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:25:47] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:25:51] they didn't say marry unto the angel how
[1:25:53] shall this be seeing I know not a man
[1:25:56] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:25:58] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:26:01] the power of the highest shall
[1:26:02] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:26:05] thing which see you call it the holy
[1:26:08] thing that Holy thing
[1:26:10] you see that Holy thing
