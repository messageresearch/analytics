All of our visiting friends do welcome you in the bride tabernacle and those that are listening in. We thank God for you at this time. We thank everyone for standing for the word. If you have a special need as we bow our heads to the Lord, just make your requests known unto the Lord. Certainly God, we know that as David said, I was happy. I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. Father, what is what a privilege it is, what a blessing it is to come into your house, Lord. Lord, to give you honor, give you praise. Lord, we do enter into your gates with thanksgiving and the courts with praise. And Lord, we say we thank you, Lord, for your many blessings, Lord. It's a blessing to be in your house, Lord. It's a blessing to be able of me to say, "A God, I love you this morning. Appreciate you this morning. Thank you for all things, Lord. Father, may you bless these that have needs, Lord. May you bless, oh God, the word that come forth. May you touch hearts, touch lives, cause us, oh God, to love you more. In Jesus Christ's name we pray." Amen. Psalms 82. [Music] It says, "God standeth in the congregation of the mighty. He judges among the gods. How long will you judge unjustly and accept the person of the wicked? Defend the poor and the fatherless. Do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy. Read them rid them out of the hands of the wicked. They know not. Neither will they understand. They walk in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are out of what? &gt;&gt; Out of course. I have said ye are what? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Ye are gods and all of you are the children of the what? &gt;&gt; Most high. &gt;&gt; Most high. God bless you. We You may be seated. We thank God. Now we know that in the beginning, God created man in his own image and his own likeness. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to talk to you this morning about amateur gods. Amen. Uh, shake somebody hand and ask them, "Do you know who you are?" [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? Amen. Amateur gods. Amen. For he says, "For in a in a man, he's uh he's one sense a miniature creator. if he's a child of God because the spirit of God is in him who controls him who operates in him then you you you you just a miniature &gt;&gt; miniature creator &gt;&gt; you're amateur God then he and then as you would love to be in the presence of Christ and you become a part of Christ, then people love to become in your presence because you become a part of God, a son, a daughter of God. Did you ever see people that you just love to be in their presence? There's just something about them that just radiates that you just love to talk to them. And other people who are nice people, yet we don't say this unkindly, but you just can't hardly stay around them. It is because of the atmosphere that you created for you as a son of God and a miniature creator because you are a part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now uh you are a part of God. You are amateur a little God. Amen. And he says here and it talks concerning the prophets and uh let's just look look at St. John 10 and he says concerning the prophets and so forth and Jesus here um I know the Pharisees and Sadducees and religious people of that day they didn't want to acknowledge uh Jesus amen as being the son of God. And that's the same way today the people don't want to acknowledge you know you know we we find that you know the spiritual people and people that div and and uh maybe spirit the spirit realm in the spirit world they think themselves to be uh uh gods you know what I'm saying but through the Christian the real sons and daughters of God are the real I They know who they are. &gt;&gt; But the the Satan has those people believing that that they are gods, but they are not. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they are speaking things that belong to us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because we know healing is the children bread, right? &gt;&gt; So the things that uh uh the the spirit realm and those people that are smoking dope and taking drugs, they're trying to get into the spiritual realm and that they become uh uh in touch with the creator with the you know universe. They they are trying to do everything to enter into that channel to try to reach amen out for something that they don't know what they reaching for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God and became vain in the imagination and their foolish hearts were darkened. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? See, but they don't want to accept the one the only and the true and living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they're reaching out for a God. Amen. Just like on Mars Hill. Amen. Paul was saying uh uh the unknown God whom you eagerly worship. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's who I'm preaching to you. Amen. see are often times people, amen, are trying to reach for something in the spirit realm because they know they they're not just here on the earth just to uh exist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they're trying to find amen that spirituality. They're trying to connect with the spirit world because they know it's something that is missing in their life. So they're hungering and thirsting and if they if they have to take a certain drugs and they have to uh uh uh you know even they're getting high they're looking for something to to to make their conscious or plead their conscious to try to quench the thirst and the desire that they have and that only God can feel that. But they they they strive to have that thirst and that fulfillment to have that relationship because Amen. They know that they are not in the ought to be condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not what uh you were intended to be. God, you're here for a purpose and God has ordained. Amen. You has allowed you to come on earth to serve his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're here to worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But man tries to become their own god. But as amateur gods, it's only identifying us as we'll get to that. Uh because when I first started in that, that was about 40 something years ago, almost 50 years ago, I started. But it wasn't until the message of the hour that I fully understood it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when when when God servant Amen began to reveal this message and of the hour then I began to understand oh this is what I was dabbled into but I couldn't clearly uh express it but it became more it became more clarity more clear that's right &gt;&gt; once Amen it was broken down in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that this should be broken down in simplicity that you would understand who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are made in the image and the likeness of God. Amen. And Adam himself was called a son of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So now if you are son of God then that means to that is to say look at somebody that means to say God is your father &gt;&gt; your father &gt;&gt; cuz you a son of God &gt;&gt; and if you're a daughter of God you saying that God is your father &gt;&gt; uh and if God is our father then we got to recognize that We're here for a purpose and that we're more than just existing &gt;&gt; to go to work or go to school and and learn our ABCs and algebra and calculus and all of that. You know, we we're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And our greater purpose is not to go to school and and get an education and get a good job, but our greater purpose is that we're here to worship God. God has made us sons. And see, uh, the prophet God says he was a self-existent one. He was Elohim, existed by himself. Amen. And becoming, uh, um, Jehovah. Amen. He becomes a father. Amen. And he has a family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So God wanted to express those attributes. Amen. That he has a family. He don't He's not existing by himself, but it's God and his children. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; His sons and his daughters. He has a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had the angels to worship and now he has a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the family of God. &gt;&gt; We are the household of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, you know, you're not just here, Amen. by Amen. You just didn't, you know, uh from um some uh theory. Amen. The bane theory or something God created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a bane theory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody don't know about Bane theory, but nevertheless, you didn't know it wasn't a big bane and all of a sudden you bamed out of here. &gt;&gt; And become to be who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God created man in his own image. &gt;&gt; Amen. By the spoken word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He spoke and what he spoke he spoke light into existence. He spoke. Amen. And you were spirit man. &gt;&gt; And God took the clay and the dust of the ground and he formed man in his own image. So he became fleshly man. But he was spirit man first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God is a what? &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God Amen. in spirit man. Amen. Then God made a man. Amen. That he could have dominion over the the things of the earth. And Amen. And God gave him, Amen. the charge of the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So you were in charge. Amen. But Adam and Eve had dominion &gt;&gt; over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, over everything, over the earth. They were God of the earth. Now remember, the angels were in heaven, but God made man and made him God to have dominion over the earth. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; You know, often times we say, "When I get to heaven, uh, I'm going walk the streets and go." But we we understand that John said, "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, come down from God out of heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. So heaven, Amen. the heavens and streets of gold and all when it's all over and this world earth and this cosmos this world order and all this is burnt up in ashes and everything. Amen. Then God Amen. after judgment and all the white throne judgment and all and after everything has come to his end then uh the holy city that God said I go to prepare for you it's going to come down set on the earth and this is going to be your heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is going to restore back to Eden. God going to restore everything that Adam lost. God's going to restore it back to you and I. &gt;&gt; Now in spirit realm, it already has been resto restored. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you already have it in spirit form. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have been translated from the kingdom of the power of darkness and you have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Amen. There has been a spiritual amen translation that changes your life and changes your spiritual amen. Your soul amen your spirit man amen is no more trapped by sin and amen the seed of gene seed of God has been quickened and awakened amen by the Holy Ghost. Amen. And it has come, amen, into alive, amen, but it lies, amen, dominant, amen. But when the you hear the word, the gospel of your salvation and you hear that God loves you and that he is your father. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; And you take heed to that and you yield to that love that God Amen. That great fountain of love, Amen. reconnects with you, &gt;&gt; how he thought of you before the foundation of the world and how you were in his mind &gt;&gt; and God just didn't uh, you know, just didn't have to to save you by accident uh to bring you into the word for your day by accident. God knew you were ordained for it. &gt;&gt; You were predestinated to. &gt;&gt; Amen. God for knew that you would hear and God knew that you would believe him &gt;&gt; because you had a connection somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, they're not connected, so they can't come. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the father has given me, they'll come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go to John 10. I done got excited. &gt;&gt; But uh John 10 and 30 I and my father or what you know uh I was listening to a preacher and he was trying to tell the people why you ought not get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he was all showing all kind of places why Jesus and God are not the same. But and at the same time when he explaining, he was continually say they won. And I said, but all he was trying to do is block people from being baptized correctly. Because he wasn't baptized correctly. He was trying to show three persons in the godhead instead of trying to so show one person with uh with attributes &gt;&gt; which which he would uh express himself as God above us, God with us and God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But he said, "These are three distinct persons." But I want you to know the God that was above us, what he did, he changed mass. That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh he he he changed forms. Often times I use water &gt;&gt; as H2O. &gt;&gt; H2O could be in a solid form as ice. Amen. &gt;&gt; In liquid form, it could be water. &gt;&gt; And in gas form, it could be steam. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But all of it is what? &gt;&gt; H2O. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So God is in a God above us is spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The creator. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God with us was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel being interpreted as God with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said without controversy in 1 Timothy 3:16, great is the mystery of godliness, God was manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Now that was God. It wasn't three person. It was God. &gt;&gt; Manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. seen of angels preaching to the Gentiles and what &gt;&gt; believed on in the word and receive up in the what? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; That's the same God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So I'm saying to you, Amen. And don't limit God &gt;&gt; and don't try to figure out God just to believe that he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that cometh to God must first of all believe that he is &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently what? &gt;&gt; Seek him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord. Amen. And you Amen. You can find him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you seek him with your whole heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is here. He's available. He's the He He can make himself known to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He Amen. He can make himself known to you. You know, sometimes the challenge is Amen. I try, you know, sometimes we're not ready for what we asking God to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We want God to make it known under certain conditions. &gt;&gt; God, if you're real, then I want you to prove it to me. God don't have to prove nothing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; If there is a God, then let me know. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One day you'll know. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God's on time, you don't Amen. You You're not God's boss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't tell God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you can only in humility and in humbness, Amen. Say, "Amen. God, I want to know you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God, Amen. I need you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you Lord, if you're there and you see my need and my cry, Lord, I need Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God see your humility and your humbness, but you all are proud and think you know something. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, I was just reading the other day. He said uh uh uh God uh the hat. He said something about you got a seven like me seven and a a fourth head and you're trying to make God hat set on your head. You know, in other words, uh, big people in their little intelligent, they little finite mind trying to put God hat on their head. &gt;&gt; And they they little finite mind and God got an infinite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you trying to place your hat your hat uh trying to place go your hat God hat on your head &gt;&gt; trying to place God hat on your head it's too big the your little peacock brain &gt;&gt; so can you imagine that God wearing your heart. No. Amen. God h he's too broad. &gt;&gt; His mind, his ways are past finding out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His thoughts are not your thoughts. &gt;&gt; So don't you try to limit God to your little uh uh finite mind, your little uh uh intelligence. God is far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you'll never how can I by searching find out God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mind ain't able to even understand, amen, the fullness of God. He said, he said, "Eyes have not seen, air have not heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God God is so much greater than uh Amen. I'm a little thinking and I'm a little intelligent and you're trying to bring God down to your to your level. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Though he can condescend and he can come and be one of us. Amen. But amen. Even as that when Jesus came in the flesh, the Bible said he thought and not robbery to be what? &gt;&gt; Equal with God. &gt;&gt; Equal with God. Amen. I got to go &gt;&gt; back to my lesson. Amen. I said you are amateur gods. &gt;&gt; You little messiahes. You amateur gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. You gods. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got to realize to being a god that means should we be worshiped? No. We're talking about God in respect of rulership and having dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But not in the form that we should be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But everything should be subject to us. Amen. Because you rule and you have dominion. You have authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you're one that walks with authority. He walks with dominion and you know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like the prophet said that the little police come out there weigh 150 pound lift out of his hand here go 18-wheeler and he stops it. How does he stops it? He knows that he has the authority to do it. &gt;&gt; So the 18-wheeler got to get on brakes. But if the 18-wheeler run over him, he going to be in trouble. Ain't that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, because he got all the law enforcement to back him up. All of America to back him up. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, with your authority, you got all heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got all the angels. You got all the heaven backing you up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of God, you represent God on the earth. &gt;&gt; And God has given you authority, giving you dominion. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you got all the angels. Now you walking out here. Come on. Ask somebody again. You sure you know who you are? &gt;&gt; Because I see sometime we we cut ourselves short. &gt;&gt; You can never rise above that which you think. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For as a man thinkketh in his heart, what? &gt;&gt; So is he.
