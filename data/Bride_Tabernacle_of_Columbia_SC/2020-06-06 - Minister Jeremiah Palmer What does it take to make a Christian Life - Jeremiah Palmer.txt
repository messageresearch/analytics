the preeminence god bless the different Murray families in their precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles to turn with me to the book of his ego is ego of 36 I know someone what we touch based on this from a different angle just felt a layer of the Lord to maybe speak just a little bit on just thought that 0 36 24 to 29 for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you notice clean water and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I would give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall do well in the land that I give to your father's and you shall be my people and I will be your God I will also save you from all your on the cleanliness and I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no faman upon you one more scripture in the book of 2nd Corinthians 5 we want to come back here second Corinthians 5 this one scripture there 5 in 17 5 and 17 in second Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new father may you bless your word sanctified in Jesus name Amen may be seated I want to turn back to the book of ezekiel 36 where i want to take a little thought tonight what does it take to make a christian life in other words what constitutes you know christian life and i know that you have your own perception on what does it take or what does it take to make a christian life everybody basically would like to feel that what they are doing or what they are keeping is what makes them a Christian now the word Christian I looked it up in the dictionary and I saw a different little meaning but this one really stood out because it was what I was kind of looking forward to try to explain what I want to use for the thought tonight and I hoped I'm not trying to decrease the knives anyone but I want us to understand that when Jesus a dotted Calvary he finished it and he did that alone everything that we have need of is here right now the word Christian it has several meaning but I like this one by the kiss says having the qualities demonstrated and taught by Jesus Christ I like the hand it's having the qualities demonstrated I believe that when Jesus came upon an earth he'd ever skated certain qualities if you noticed one quality he had he didn't come for himself he realized that his entire life was for somebody else he didn't went to those who were religious are all right but the Bible say he went to those that were without in other words he went to those that were cast out and maybe are set aside because they could be a part of a certain church group but he had the very qualities of God was within him and he demonstrated that that's so important because we've heard so much about Kristen Kristen and yet we don't see no qualities being demonstrated we try to make Kristen life as well if you join a certain church then you build Kristen or you repeat a certain Creed are you dressed so certainly if you pay your tithes and you shout or your speakings and all things are alright but it don't make you a Kristen you may treat your neighbors right you may be faithful to the church that's good but it don't make you a Christian see I believe with Jesus one day he this man named Nicodemus met him by night a rabbi a preacher and he came in asking him what must he do I believe that some time that we have allowed people to tell us that we are Kristen because we're doing a certain thing that they may want us to do I believe but Kristen life has qualities the love of God and that love is not partial and that love love in spite of not because of who you are and what you got that's not what Jesus did but he came and died for those that were without those that were without any hope or nothing like that but it was a quality that God had in him you know I was thinking about telling somebody you know that really under sundar standing that there are a lot of good people that really try hard to live a Christian life they try hard and then look like the heartily tried to deceive me can't measure up see because is not your human efforts it's a new work that God does within you see I want to go to because ego and look at this because I saw some things notice the Bible said in 2nd Corinthians that all the in Christ all things are new the life that you now live you live it by the Son of God Christianity as I see that people sometimes seem to get very discouraged because of are they are trying to do what the church is telling them to do but yet the qualities of Christ is not being demonstrated and sometimes they wonder why why am I always seem to coming up short why my life seems to be full of ups and downs and I can't seem to get settling it it's because maybe that you haven't been a fully baptized you know with the Holy Ghost though you made a confession though you've been just a father though you've been sanctified and all those things are good we need to do those things but I want to say you know any birth it produces a certain kind of life that's why Jesus told Nicodemus that you must be born again he acts and how how can I be born again that's the great question of the church world because they've been taught when you believed and you've been born again but then they don't see the qualities of God manifests are demonstrated they are struggling from new to live a holy life they still can vivid ever with the world and then in church at the same time but God is calling for separation see Christianity is a separate life there will skilltree and Lu say that you know you can't put new wine in old bottles where you can't mix the life of Christ with the world - there got to be a difference not just I was dressing and not just the thing we do out late but it's an inward work that only it's a supernatural experience that only God can give you and when that happened then you walk differently your conversations are different the places that you used to go you don't wanna go anymore the words I have no desire why because it's a new creation my desires are different it's in the Naturals like a woman you know who's expecting a child appetite changes why because it's another life is not to be born and she craved for different foods and and why because of a birth that is about to take place and I believe that your spiritual birth it'll cause you to have a different appetite the thing that you used to like you don't like them anymore not because you are better than anybody else but because of Christ came in so all things got to become new see God don't do patch-up work when God saves he saves to the utmost I wonder sometimes and I look at even the out of my life you know when God created everything he created everything in a certain way and every animal has their own characteristics they have their own qualities now a dog is is born the dog he don't have to ask any bark it's already in him why because it's the quality of a dog and it's be demonstrated even as a little puppy you here little puppy he been born they Charlotte you know why because it's in them they don't struggle to do that and see that's what I'm when Christ really comes in then you don't struggle to live a Christian life because it's inside of you so it'll work itself out side but we try to manufacture what God word is calling for without God doing a supernatural working us yet we still have the label of I'm a Christian now here in his ego if you notice in the 25th verse dinner one hour sprinkle clean water on you God wants to clean you he wants to make all things new that's why he washes us in the word sitting up under the word it begins to purify your heart it began to show you things in your life you know that that you need to be cleaned from I know we used to have a time that we had good moral standards that we used to keep you know but we're finding out in this generation here the standard has gone that standard of holiness and and living a clean life we used to understand that your body is the temple of the holy ghosts and Paul said that I present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service so you have got a part to play that you you must understand that coming to into Christ is is to be our new and I can remember so clearly you know that when God touched me and I knew something happened though it was more to it but I know it was a new beginning because that even in that justifying state you know I wanted ah you know more out of life than just what the world was offered though yet I didn't understand fully what was going on but I know something had happened many of time we be in church and and we say we hear God's voice and how God speak to us and and what he told you so I believe that once you really hear the voice of God it'll cause you to react differently though you may not fully understand it but it'll be a chain that I come over yeah we see sometimes that's the problem we just don't want to come over us we will God to get in us until that happens we can do all the outward things that a christen are doing and we can have God on us and own our spirit but he got to go deeper than that God said I'll cleanse you and he shall be clean oh how how does it feel to to be rid of all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you in then gonna say now a new heart see everything God has given us isn't new it's not something patched up something like the people go to rehab to get rehabilitated no no God wants to change that heart kind of others say the man hard as wickedness a new heart also will I give you not only a new heart but a new spirit listen a new spirit will output within you this is all what God is doing see it's not something you work up or something you manufacture but is you dis yiling to him and let him take control yeah you surrendering your life to him seeing that's what God wants God just don't want us to have a label tag to us with no qualities and demonstration I was telling some people as I always said now especially I believe there has to be a first in the bottle state when he who is hungry in thirst after righteousness they shall be filled and I believe that our believe is here now that if there is another thirst in us you know to really examine ourselves you know and be certain that the qualities of a Christian is in us so many times that we we want a label of Christian life are only two when we come to church but that's not a Christian life when you ain't Church but it should be more so on the outside cuz see our light shine better in darkness and when when there's been a change in you didn't you take that outside of the church and then that life that you live it begins to magnify itself if the qualities of God is really there then what you have people will be thirsty for it I realize that there are some thirsty people looking for God and not just a form of God but they want the realities today I saw so much forms but they haven't seen no qualities they've heard the preaching you've heard the singing they'll had a sharpening the speaking in tongues but where are the quality is the love of God the long-suffering the patience the faith the godliness the temperance where are the real qualities that are you will love God regardless of in spite of what you have to go through your love for God won't change see real qualities look at what Jesus had look at what the early church had in the book of Acts before them when they when shields were with them in a New Testament he was teaching him a command missing and preaching them about the things in and you know he had a little problem with a man one time called Peter one of his great disciples one who he gave the keys to but he told Peter what they said Peter he said after you have been converted they descripton your brother he knew that Peter need a conversion a deeper conversion but as long as he was with them they were rejoicing and they love the Lord but Jesus even knew that why he told them even bookmark you know that go to Jerusalem and Terry wait until you be endued with power from on high Z he know that it didn't needed something even though they had the word that he talked but they need something to give them power to keep the words and you may hear a lot of good sermon is in a lot of good things preached but the Bible say the letter killeth but the Spirit give life I like their scripture I won't turn to a second Timothy 3:16 says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God about us in Romans if you have not the Spirit of Christ he said you another here's that's that's pretty tough so in order to be identified to be a really of Christ he must be in you see but too many times I believe that the people had been getting some kind of false security or a false hope that just having religion is good enough no you need to let him come in not just come in at the door but let him have preeminence the her brother Ernest remember he was saying one time what's the matter with Jesus you know they said he loved him and they don't mind him coming in but did I want him to be the ruler sometimes people love coming to church they love the things that the church does but they don't want God the total rule their lives they give them give him part of it in other words so they still can do things that they do in God I'm gonna serve you on Sunday always the night the Lord on the other Days learn our Lord I got some things that I need to do know God wants all he's looking for a total commitment it's like a man that when he married a woman marry they're looking for a total commitment and God is looking for a total commitment but notice that down to work that Jesus came to do you know because it was God living in him he couldn't do those thing except God was in him that's why his birth was a supernatural birth it couldn't be some contaminated sexual birth but it was a supernatural birth see because he was God on earth living in a human vessel to do what to reconcile the world back to himself what he was doing was showing that what you see me did through Jesus Christ I want to get in you to the church world don't want to let him in money in the book of Revelation in that the Laodicean Church age Jesus was knocking at the door and about to say they won't let him in he was knocking on the church door and they wouldn't let him come in I pray tonight that you will let him come in and let him go through you let him purge you let him wash you let him break those powers you know of the world out of your life got her beat about I said because you can't serve two masters you know it's time to let it all go let that all life go it ain't gonna do you no good here for a season you know you have pleasure but the end of it is death and God came to give you a life and to give you life more abundantly God something that would like to say but I don't know if I have time let's go goat me to one example and I'm gonna close with this in the Book of Luke can't seem to get away Luke 18 sometimes you know people feel that because they keep the church Commandments in their gonna be alright because that's what they was talked but ababa tell us search the scriptures don't take meant search them if you think you have internalized he the Scriptures testify of him the very qualities of God you know or can be demonstrated in your very life mom I'm not gonna read all of I'm gonna paraphrase 18 Luke 18 in 18 they say they're certain you know the story about a young rich ruler he came to Jesus and I some good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life they had a conversation in videos talking about the commandments and all those things and he began to reply Lord he said all these have I kept from my youth but in other words he kept he was liking something could it be that you've kept what the church said you read the Bible but still you feel within yourself you are liking something and sometimes we try to replace that with with uh-oh we'll have a chance to it give the people more entertainment give them a work to do in the church give them better programs and and socials life why because the real life of God they can't produce it their Creed's can't do it all the entertainment they giving them can't do it so what are they going to do with the people they go around in a circle after a while sever the God say this he said if you are born again and I'm closing if you are born again of the Spirit of God you are at Kristen c4 you are born again distressed that you must be no matter how much you may confess that your Kristen until those qualities until the very life of God come in you and and those quality begin to be demonstrated he said but only but you must be born again must be born of the Holy Ghost must come into your life in that mixture your Christian that seals you until the day of your redemption as long as you live right keep him with you you'll make it I'm telling you it's an hour to be confessing something and don't possess it we have enough trouble with people seeing so much hypocritical lives where to write in church the people have seemed to lost confidence they used to go to church for help not to say what's the use they are not living no better than I am they can't help me they see the to the preacher living double lives but they see this and they seeing that but I want to tell you though you may see all of that there are some people still that is possessing the life I pray that we all will examine I be sure that those qualities are being demonstrated not by Richert not because you work hard for the church but know that you will yield your life so much to God that you love giving him preeminence god bless you tonight raise the Lord amen was it what does it take to be a Christian amen praise God Christ's coming down inside of you living its life through you it's very important I was just praying as minister Parma sharing the word tonight it's a lot going on in the world today and a lot going on in our city in our country the world has come to a place that took a death to shake the whole nation in the world today and the people are crying out for change private of God said it takes a desperation to bring Christ on the scene people got to get desperate if you want God you got to get desperate he did hungry and thirst after righteousness shall be filled we got to get in desperation if we want to see God in our lives we want to see a real move of God we got to become desperate but sometimes as God's servant said something got to happen to us sometimes the calls us to get in desperation some crisis gotta happen in our lives to get us in desperation I thought about how the words to Blackson everybody's marching together for change they seem to come together we want to change rule things would be better and I believe that if the world can come together oftentimes it said the most subjugated place is the church the blacks are here the whites are there and I believe it's time it's comfort the people to get desperate and realize that God is calling us by one spirit into one body we cannot treat a black brother different from a white brother or white brother different from a black brother the time has come for change a brother is a brother once spirit are we baptized into one body Jesus got to be Jesus not a white cheeses are black Jesus but a God shows himself in head shows up for you and I they meant identified by his alarm that is godly love his character verified in his own characteristics a compassionate God that loves you dine he has no partiality they man well I believe that God knows them there are hears and God makes a way for you to get where you need to be he makes provision for you because God said whosoever will let him come take of the water of life freely I believe that it's something inside of a child of God that makes the right decision and makes the right choice I believe that something are deep in their heart begin to pull I want God no matter what it takes I want the Holy Ghost I want to live for God I want to be a Christian well it takes for me to be a Christian I want to live a Christian life oh yes the time has come that the real Christians sure praise God not be cold identified with a church identified with a group but identified with Christ and here's the word you abide in me and my words abide in you then you can act what you will and I'll do it people are sadly mistaken their attitude towards one another is their attitude towards God if you've got the wrong attitude towards your brother or your sister then where are we brother sister you can't love God until you can love your brother are you with me God is good in that I'm sorry because if they can watch for the rights that out there then I believe it's time for us to begin to get on our knees and cry out cry out for the injustice that are done not only in the world in this city but all injustice oh this is sin and God has called us to a higher calling he calls us into the kingdom of God and coming into the kingdom of God that God is calling you in the fight for something oh it's so much higher than what man is fighting for he meant the fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life he meant realized that your battle is not Amen earthly battle your kingdom is not of this world but your fighting either hallelujah award they may get spiritual wickedness in high places you're fighting against the powers of darkness of this world you're fighting and you got to be equipped to fight this battle brothers just this time that we get about our father's business it's time for us to just start out that's a guard I want to fight the good fight of faith well I want to build a battlefield for the Lord I need Jesus in my life I need the power David I'm godly jealous of those that are in the heat in the hot Sun standing up for what they believe so do you believe are you a part of them I'm working on my knees praying God you you know what's right whatever is right you'll pay amen but I got something I'm fighting that I was there join me in my battle they meant come and fight against these demons and devils hey that's Holden man in the chains of darkness they met blinding men from the light of the love of God if everyone could come to God and come to the cross and accept the blood of Jesus oh what a world we live in hey what a country we live here if man will just repent and come to Jesus oh yes we can live in a better America we can live in a better world in it but we know Amen that what's going on it's just for season I believe there has to be a change in the day's society and the way things are gone but there must be a change in the church what we're changing each Christian in it what am i alive we must get a hold of God in such a way that we elevated above the things of the world that the power of God becomes a real to us that people of the Holy Ghost demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost well yes mother sister hey man yo SAR broken strongholds up or down hey people are healed see something gotta happen that must be a people that get that's word for change gotta come now you promised oh yes he met people get desperate I don't believe they're gonna give up then I go stop today then I go stop tomorrow hey man praise God because they're fighting for something that they believe in and if you believe in what you're fighting for they meant men you got to be desperate and you got to get about your father's business amen to let God lead you God leads you they met the mark that's you and God leaves me praise God so I what you say brother amen do you be led by the spirit you all individuals one because you individual God is going you're gonna be accounted for what God said to you we got to learn to know God fire self people say well the preachers say the church say no what did God say to you Amen as an individual but what God is saying to me I'll call you to a higher calling you got a greater fight on your hand you got a greater fight thanks you get better in this world but I want things to get better in your life amen you might be able to do things that you couldn't do in time pass but I want you to be able to be able to get in the kingdom of God I want you to be able to go to heaven I don't want you to miss the joy and the peace and the love that God has in store for you right now the world to come are you with me but you can miss out you can change your energy and your passion and you can try to fight for the things that are going on in this earth today but I say pray for your fellow brother and pray for the bereaved family pray for those that are are going and they're marching for something and if that's their lot let it be their lot amen somebody got to do what they do but what you're doing God called you to be Christians to fight the good fight of faith amen God called you into the kingdom of God what's going on in the church I believe some folks are think when they get to heaven there's gonna be this little white group over here and this little African group over here and there's a little Trinidad group and this little Jamaican group and all of these groupies it's not gonna be a groupie thing sometimes in the local church if okay aim it there's a little set of people to this little family and I love family people think they're gonna go to heaven like that heaven is not the garden the Christ is not divided there's one body in one spirit oh you with me so let's get all of that stuff out of our mind and trying to figure out how our goal move just get in the spirit and God a ticket where you need to be hey hallelujah ain't God good y'all keep fighting the good fight of faith we're in a battle we're in a wall amen praise God I pray for my brothers and sisters out there in that hot Sun amen he said are you compassion my heart is bleeding I'm hurting amen I'm hurting all of us ought to be hurting amen well

services people are marching the Lord they are determined for change Lord our prayers go with them Lord that change can come the real battles that a black man can walk the streets again not fearing the police it makes it better in this world but I believe God whether this world gets better or not I know you got a better place for us about him a better world no matter what man does how good they make it Lord they can make a heaven like you a world that whence nothing to love no more pain no more sorrow no more crying no more down that's kind of world that you made bodies that we'll never get
