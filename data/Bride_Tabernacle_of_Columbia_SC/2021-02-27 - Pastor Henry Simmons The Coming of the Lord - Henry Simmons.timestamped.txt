[31:26] in jesus name amen
[31:32] god is good amen
[31:35] first thessalonians 4 is very familiar
[31:38] but
[31:39] i had another way i was going and as i
[31:42] was friend
[31:43] i kind of got stirred because i was
[31:45] praying seeking god for direction and
[31:48] guidance
[31:50] you know a lot of things that in life
[31:52] you want want to do
[31:54] to just try to help folk
[31:57] you know it's many things that you want
[31:59] to do just to help
[32:00] folks to have a better life
[32:04] sometimes you know people
[32:07] think about community service you think
[32:09] about
[32:10] helping you know in any way you can help
[32:13] folk you
[32:14] you know as a christian you just got
[32:16] that about you you want to help people
[32:19] and so i was thinking about what kind
[32:21] what can we do
[32:22] to be a help to the community or be the
[32:24] help to one another
[32:26] and i was thinking about that and
[32:28] praying lord
[32:30] you know i got many desires first
[32:33] thessalonians 4
[32:34] and 13.
[32:38] it says
[32:42] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[32:44] brethren
[32:45] concerning them which are sleep
[32:49] that you sorry not even as others which
[32:52] have no hope
[32:54] for if we believe that jesus died and
[32:58] rose again
[32:59] even so them also will sleep in jesus
[33:02] will god bring with him
[33:05] for this we say unto you
[33:09] by the word of the lord
[33:12] that we which are alive
[33:15] and remain unto the what
[33:18] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[33:20] them not sleep
[33:23] for the lord himself shall descend from
[33:24] heaven with a
[33:26] shout with the voice of an archangel
[33:28] with the trump of god
[33:30] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[33:33] then we which are alive and remain shall
[33:35] be caught up
[33:36] together with them in the clouds
[33:39] to meet the lord and now and so shall we
[33:42] ever be with the lord we're full
[33:43] confident one another with these words
[33:45] god bless you reading which word you may
[33:47] be seated
[33:50] in the 15th verse he says for this we
[33:53] say
[33:54] unto you by the word of the lord that we
[33:58] that we which are lodged and remain
[34:02] until the coming of the lord should not
[34:05] prevent them that sleep
[34:08] he's addressing us that are lie you know
[34:12] could you think that such a word and
[34:15] such
[34:16] sermons that would preach what
[34:18] anticipation
[34:21] that those people and what expectation
[34:24] it should have set those people's
[34:26] hearts on fire i mean they could
[34:29] should have been stirred to the utmost
[34:32] because the jesus
[34:36] that had died and was crucified had
[34:38] risen
[34:40] and had come forth to vindicate that he
[34:43] was alive
[34:45] showed himself by many infallible proofs
[34:48] but he promised
[34:52] after a period of time paul comes in and
[34:55] meets him on the water road to the
[34:57] masters and later on he began to
[35:00] pin these letters to the churches and
[35:04] to give the church expectation and hope
[35:08] and understanding about god's redemptive
[35:11] plan
[35:14] so they will earn the great expectation
[35:16] god
[35:18] the coming of the lord i believe that
[35:22] they had that expectation that
[35:24] i'm coming back
[35:27] not only am i coming back but the muscle
[35:31] was something that way
[35:32] back in job when he talked about my
[35:34] redeemer live
[35:39] they must have known something about a
[35:42] resurrection
[35:45] because even joseph said don't leave my
[35:47] bones
[35:48] in egypt
[35:52] they must have knew that it was
[35:54] something
[35:56] that they could be on the expectation
[35:59] that
[35:59] there was going to be a resurrection
[36:01] even uh the story was told at ladder's
[36:04] grave i know i see my brother again
[36:08] so they knew that was life after death
[36:10] i'll see him again god
[36:12] is coming by in the resurrection after
[36:15] what
[36:17] i believe that they talked about our day
[36:21] because they said in the resurrection at
[36:23] the last day
[36:25] are you with me and we are saying that
[36:28] we are living in the last
[36:29] days because amen david
[36:33] it has been said they meant for the last
[36:36] 2000 years in the last days because
[36:39] on the day of pentecost he said this was
[36:41] that was spoken of by the prophet joel
[36:44] that in the last days said god i poured
[36:47] my spirit upon what
[36:49] all flesh so they must have thought that
[36:52] amen
[36:53] we're in the last days amen so there
[36:56] must be a resurrection not that it's not
[36:58] a
[36:59] resurrection that did not take place in
[37:01] their day because jesus had died in the
[37:04] old saints of the old testament
[37:06] rose up with him walked around jerusalem
[37:11] they had experienced a coming of the
[37:14] lord
[37:14] that had come in their day and there was
[37:17] a supernatural happening there was a
[37:19] vindication
[37:20] amen that god amen
[37:24] amen had promised him a resurrection and
[37:27] he had given them
[37:28] a resurrection the saints saw
[37:33] they met the saints that were dead
[37:35] walking around jerusalem
[37:38] the prophet god tells us about a
[37:39] resurrection in the rapture message
[37:42] that it was 40 days before he went
[37:46] back so just before the rapture
[37:51] amen we shouldn't be on anticipation of
[37:53] the coming of the lord
[37:55] but the saints that went on
[37:59] it was said that we perhaps just before
[38:02] the rapture we'll begin to communicate
[38:05] with those saints
[38:07] and see those saints that are crossed
[38:09] over beyond the curtain of time
[38:12] and we'll see them and we'll be able to
[38:14] talk to them
[38:16] are you up there so as they appeared
[38:20] until many
[38:21] at that resurrection what about this
[38:23] resurrection
[38:26] the coming of the lord
[38:30] so i know you know it's a lot of things
[38:32] we wish to do
[38:33] we wish to achieve and what you should
[38:35] accomplish and
[38:37] and you know i'm so proud of the
[38:39] achievements that a lot of you are
[38:40] making in life
[38:42] things that you're accomplishing and and
[38:45] i can be happy
[38:46] for you i'm happy you know for
[38:48] achievements my children and know
[38:50] that they'll make it but that's not what
[38:52] god called me
[38:54] amen to pat you on the back concerning
[38:56] your achievements in here
[38:59] because that's not what i'm preaching
[39:00] all about i think god fought those
[39:02] things
[39:03] but those things uh amen uh uh they they
[39:07] they're they're small
[39:10] they they they they're not compared to
[39:14] what amen i i i thank god for
[39:17] all the other things but they ain't
[39:19] nothing
[39:21] amen there's nothing to compare to what
[39:24] god has in store for you or not
[39:27] so amen so don't make that your
[39:31] major let it be a minor in your life
[39:35] because when you make these things major
[39:38] amen then god becomes your mind
[39:42] are you with me and so when god becomes
[39:45] the
[39:46] less instead of the greater
[39:49] oh you want me you need to have god
[39:53] flourish and all these other things
[39:56] he said our what i think we get more
[40:00] excited off of those other things than
[40:02] we get excited about the law
[40:06] i believe we'll shout and we'll be happy
[40:10] overjoyed over these things
[40:13] in this life that we have achieved and
[40:15] accomplished
[40:16] what about your soul
[40:21] what about your soul brother sister
[40:24] so i'm talking about the coming of the
[40:26] lord i
[40:28] like i say who wouldn't want to do nice
[40:31] things and to help amen families and
[40:34] help
[40:35] children help marriages help this help
[40:37] that
[40:39] and it's so many things that we could
[40:41] just probably get together
[40:43] and orchestrate and draw out and you
[40:46] know and try to help people to better
[40:48] themselves
[40:49] it's a lot of plans a lot of things
[40:52] could go hey you can do this better you
[40:54] can do that better you can do this
[40:56] better oh you could do this and you can
[40:58] do that
[41:02] as god told me years ago when i first
[41:05] started out
[41:08] i saw the people down the mullens
[41:10] working in the field
[41:12] sun up the sun down i think
[41:16] maybe twenty dollars a day
[41:19] hot
[41:23] 12 hours
[41:27] and they was working in those fields and
[41:29] i said
[41:31] i said i could try to help these people
[41:34] do better than that they don't have to
[41:36] live like that
[41:40] and i saw potential in all of them and i
[41:43] saw that they could achieve way beyond
[41:45] that
[41:46] and i saw that oh let me help not only
[41:49] the ones in the church but i want to
[41:51] help the community
[41:53] god said i didn't call you for that i
[41:56] did not call you for that
[42:02] it's the soul of man you're concerned
[42:06] about their soul
[42:08] are you with me your soul me is worth
[42:11] more than ten thousand worlds
[42:14] are you with me so your soul is the
[42:17] thing that god is
[42:19] interested in your soul
[42:22] so he said what prophet a man to gain
[42:24] the whole world and lose his soul
[42:28] so as i was thinking
[42:31] trying to get direction trying to get
[42:33] guidance of some of the things you get
[42:36] excited to do amen
[42:39] you see other people are doing things
[42:41] you want to do
[42:42] things you know
[42:45] then call you for that said get
[42:49] the people ready
[42:54] get the people ready for my
[42:58] coming
[43:01] get the people ready for the coming of
[43:04] the lord
[43:06] you know the scripture said the coming
[43:08] of the lord draw it
[43:10] if they said it two thousand years ago
[43:13] that the covenant of the lord draws nah
[43:15] what about now
[43:20] what about now it's not a
[43:25] that they started bombing syria
[43:31] it's not a coincidence that russia don't
[43:34] like that
[43:37] are you with me
[43:41] things are happening and materializing
[43:43] before our eyes
[43:46] and i can see why god says get your mind
[43:48] off of all these other things
[43:51] get the people ready for the coming
[43:54] of the lord are you a man
[44:02] a lot of things that we're excited about
[44:05] but are you ready for his coming are you
[44:09] prepared
[44:10] so let me in three things
[44:15] that the lord does uh
[44:18] and i'm i'm i'm cutting things kind of
[44:21] compact
[44:22] and not telling the whole story but i
[44:24] hope you all that's following the
[44:27] word understand what i'm talking about
[44:31] so he says in the 16th verse for the
[44:34] lord himself not
[44:35] somebody else but the lord himself
[44:41] and we understand that when we talk
[44:43] about the book of the redemption no man
[44:45] was able to take the book
[44:47] but the lion of the tribe of judah
[44:50] prevailed
[44:52] and he saw as it was a lamb slain
[44:54] [Music]
[44:56] are you with me you saw a bloody lamb
[44:59] he said for thy word did they take the
[45:01] book and then loose the word
[45:05] and because he is worthy i don't know
[45:07] what i get to a sunday because
[45:09] he's worthy we ought to do something
[45:14] they said worthy is the lamb we ought to
[45:17] give him something
[45:19] are you with me i get excited right i
[45:21] don't want to get excited now maybe
[45:23] sunday morning we get excited about it
[45:25] because i i some said don't don't miss
[45:28] that out
[45:29] don't miss our part because i don't want
[45:33] you to just
[45:33] intellectually learn i want you to be
[45:35] able to respond
[45:38] to the word that you have digested
[45:41] you know when you eat something that's
[45:43] good
[45:45] and you said that was good
[45:49] i told my wife i said that was really
[45:52] a good meal sunday
[45:56] you know what i'm saying it wasn't
[45:59] something where but it was just so tasty
[46:02] you know what i'm saying and i i i think
[46:06] god want to know when you get it
[46:09] run when you get the vision
[46:13] read it and what run if you don't run
[46:17] you don't get it
[46:19] but if you get it you read it and you're
[46:21] right that means you understand what i'm
[46:23] talking about
[46:24] but if you're not running you know what
[46:27] somebody said fire you fire your fire
[46:30] and then you said no
[46:31] fire fight you ain't getting it
[46:35] but don't let amen the smoke start
[46:38] coming up and go
[46:39] fire that's what they mean fire
[46:42] and you wait till too late and then you
[46:44] start running
[46:46] you you they tell you it was fire fight
[46:50] the alarm goes off the fire alarm goes
[46:53] off
[46:53] and and you supposed to know it's time
[46:56] to get out the building
[46:59] oh you get out the house the alarm going
[47:01] off fire
[47:03] oh you're with me so i i'm saying
[47:07] the coming of the lord draws nine and
[47:10] i'm trying to
[47:11] by the grace of god they may get your
[47:14] mind
[47:14] focused amen
[47:18] because if you don't get focused amen in
[47:21] this late hour if we don't
[47:23] focus on the coming of the lord and
[47:26] really give the most earnest heave
[47:28] to the things we hear we'll let them
[47:32] live and if we let them
[47:35] slip he said how shall we escape if we
[47:38] neglect so greater salvation
[47:41] this salvation is great and we are not
[47:44] illegal neglected
[47:47] amen what god has done for us when he
[47:50] took the book
[47:51] amen you must understand it ought to set
[47:55] your soul on fire
[47:57] and if your soul not set on fire that
[48:00] means you don't understand
[48:02] amen that's why you're not running
[48:06] okay he says
[48:09] matthew 25 i'll just go uh well i i i
[48:13] let me finish reading that in in the
[48:15] 16th verse
[48:16] it says for the lord himself shall
[48:19] descend from heaven with the shout
[48:20] that's the first thing he does the next
[48:23] thing with the voice of an archangel
[48:26] that's the second thing in the trump of
[48:28] god
[48:29] these things that happens cause a
[48:32] response
[48:35] amen and when these things happen
[48:38] he said and the dead what
[48:42] the dead in christ shall what
[48:45] rise first amen now sometimes
[48:49] we look at amen as the prophet said we
[48:52] were in dead
[48:53] denominational systems
[48:57] and we've been resurrected out of those
[48:59] systems
[49:01] are you with me god comes amen
[49:06] as those dry bones he said can these
[49:09] moans live
[49:10] he said lord god down north
[49:14] so god calls you amen out
[49:17] amen of sin and cause you out of dead
[49:20] denomination of sister not
[49:24] amen individuals are called out
[49:28] amen just like it is where the shark
[49:32] is not the wheat green
[49:35] are you with me the shark amen
[49:38] has to they meant pull away and the
[49:41] wheat grain
[49:41] comes in the presence of the sun isn't
[49:43] that right
[49:44] the s-u-n sun and the s-o-n the wheat
[49:48] the word this corn the wheat that falls
[49:51] in the ground and die it abides along
[49:53] but it comes back are you up man
[49:58] blade oh god i can't get into that
[50:01] but i hope you're getting it the the
[50:04] totality
[50:06] of what the coming of the lord is all
[50:08] about
[50:09] if we see amen that is harvest time
[50:12] that god will manifest itself and send
[50:15] his angels
[50:16] to separate the wheat from the time
[50:20] are you with me so he said let them
[50:24] alone
[50:26] are you with me there was some that
[50:28] would
[50:29] ankle their faith in the word and would
[50:31] recognize what god is doing
[50:34] with the word there are others that are
[50:37] be
[50:38] spectators and onlookers but they have
[50:41] no
[50:42] gene seed life in them to reproduce
[50:45] itself it may look identical like real
[50:49] grain
[50:50] but there it is a hybrid seed
[50:53] and it doesn't have life in it to
[50:55] reproduce itself
[50:57] are you with me praise god
[51:02] so that we don't look for it to be
[51:05] amen to come back in even resurrection
[51:08] form
[51:09] you plant it in the ground and you see
[51:12] it may look like corn
[51:15] but look what it cannot reproduce life
[51:19] are you with me so when we see the word
[51:23] is sown in our hearts
[51:26] the word of god comes down to reproduce
[51:30] jesus christ again in right form but we
[51:33] can't see bride are you with me
[51:37] and when you don't see bride if but if
[51:40] it's gene
[51:41] seed life then it can reproduce christ
[51:44] again
[51:45] if you have the baptism of the holy
[51:48] ghost down in your soul it shall be
[51:50] vindicated by the light you live
[51:54] amen that god had vindicated who you are
[51:57] doesn't matter what man think about you
[52:00] doesn't matter what man say about you
[52:03] but amen the life will testify of itself
[52:07] the tree is known by
[52:10] there's fruit are you up man
[52:16] i gotta get away from here for a minute
[52:18] and try to
[52:19] follow matthew 25.
[52:23] i all these things you you know
[52:27] he said the second episcopal beloved i
[52:30] write into you in both which i
[52:32] stir up your pure mind by way of
[52:34] remembrance
[52:37] i can't tell you nothing that you don't
[52:39] know
[52:40] if anybody try to tell you exceed
[52:44] something that you don't know then is
[52:47] something wrong with you
[52:48] because you he said i never knew you
[52:52] but if you've been for known of god then
[52:54] the lord knows them that are his
[52:57] amen and have you been born again of the
[52:59] holy ghost
[53:00] amen the bible said you need not that
[53:02] any man teach you
[53:04] he said but the comfort of which is the
[53:06] holy ghost when he come he'll teach you
[53:08] what
[53:09] all things isn't that right so when
[53:12] somebody come to teach you
[53:14] something that you don't know just look
[53:15] at them
[53:19] the holy ghost knows what yeah he
[53:23] he should know the holy ghost and you
[53:25] know all things
[53:26] so that's smart individual amen trying
[53:29] to tell you
[53:30] something amen
[53:34] but by the grace of god you must know
[53:36] that he that's in you
[53:38] is the teacher and the holy ghost is
[53:40] your teacher
[53:42] amen the only thing we come to witness
[53:44] to
[53:45] amen the word that's inside of you by
[53:48] spirit
[53:48] amen we come amen to witness to you
[53:51] concerning that same spirit word that's
[53:54] in you
[53:56] amen and if it's in you then it has a
[53:59] resurrection power
[54:01] amen then amen praise god word witness
[54:04] to word
[54:06] you are quickened by his spirit amen
[54:10] because there's something that inside of
[54:12] you that testifies and says
[54:14] amen praise god you can't help from
[54:17] saying amen
[54:19] pray amen why because it's the truth
[54:22] the word bear witness with the truth
[54:26] amen your spirit bear witness with the
[54:28] truth
[54:30] amen praise god your spirit can't bear
[54:33] witness with
[54:34] all this oh lord
[54:38] all this nonsense stuff and thank you
[54:42] intellectually smart
[54:44] know something god don't know
[54:47] are you with me god knows all things
[54:51] and it's given to you to know the what
[54:54] the mysteries
[54:56] isn't that right if you're a bride it's
[54:59] given to you
[55:00] to know the mysteries 25
[55:03] and and six
[55:07] now uh they're coming to the lord
[55:10] he's coming the bible says that the
[55:13] kingdom of heaven is like until
[55:15] 10 virgins amen y'all understand the
[55:18] story
[55:20] amen which took the lamps and went
[55:22] forward to
[55:24] meet the bridegroom are you with me
[55:29] we find that the story picks up
[55:33] some took oil and some in the vessel
[55:36] with their lamps
[55:39] and some just had all in their lamps
[55:44] are you with me so in the oil represent
[55:48] the holy ghost
[55:50] amen see there are many anointed ones in
[55:54] end times
[55:56] amen anointed once in the end time amen
[56:00] i'm gonna tell you something many
[56:03] many people said seed does not persecute
[56:05] seed
[56:08] are you with me but that's just a saying
[56:11] and a phrase
[56:13] when it comes to revelation time
[56:17] amen some people love their brother
[56:23] but hate their sister some people love
[56:26] their sister hate their brother
[56:30] you with me amen but seed cannot
[56:33] persecute seed because
[56:36] amen you have that god pain in you
[56:40] amen let god pay love amen
[56:44] praise god you do not fear what man can
[56:48] do to you
[56:51] amen because you have a god pain in you
[56:57] amen so that
[57:00] oh lord i can't let me go head on
[57:04] let god pay love god's love dwells in
[57:06] you
[57:07] amen and if god love dwells in you you
[57:10] got to stop
[57:11] thinking like a man acting like a man
[57:13] you got to act like sons and daughters
[57:15] of god
[57:19] if you don't know who you are amen how
[57:22] you expect the preacher
[57:24] to tell you who you are
[57:29] and you get excited because the preacher
[57:31] tell you you
[57:32] are bride but if you
[57:35] down in your soul not in your spirit
[57:37] nothing has quickened
[57:39] you and identified who you are to you
[57:42] as an investor as an individual
[57:45] that must be an intelligent down in you
[57:49] that speaks to your heart to identify to
[57:52] you that you are
[57:53] sons and daughters of god and because
[57:56] you know who you
[57:57] are you behave yourself as sons and
[58:00] daughters of god
[58:03] your conduct will be a conduct as
[58:06] becoming holiness
[58:09] you have a godly character
[58:13] you cannot help it it doesn't matter
[58:15] amen
[58:16] you know when when folk can do stuff to
[58:18] you and say stuff about you
[58:20] to make your character different and
[58:22] make you certain certain things
[58:24] make you act a certain way that means
[58:27] that god is still
[58:28] working on you are you up man
[58:32] so when uh you know whatever they did to
[58:35] jesus they did
[58:36] everything they spit on him they they
[58:39] whipped him and they did everything to
[58:41] him
[58:42] but he stayed loving them he loved them
[58:44] enough
[58:45] honestly from his heart he said forgive
[58:48] him
[58:51] somebody spit on you honestly from your

[1:15:38] because god can do it better than i can
[1:15:42] oh you would be so it ain't easy today
[1:15:46] it's not easy being a parent it's not
[1:15:48] easy being a preacher a pastor
[1:15:52] especially it's not an easy job
[1:15:55] it's very difficult in this hour that
[1:15:58] we're living in
[1:16:00] are you with me let me do jesus
[1:16:04] brother says y'all got to pray this
[1:16:06] thing too
[1:16:07] life is short and the coming of the lord
[1:16:10] is close i believe it's really really
[1:16:14] really really close
[1:16:16] and i believe if i if i don't
[1:16:22] really make it clear to you
[1:16:26] that you must get a hold of god if i
[1:16:29] don't make it
[1:16:30] really clear that nothing in this world
[1:16:34] is worth your soul being lost off
[1:16:38] are you with me nothing anybody say to
[1:16:42] you or say about you
[1:16:43] can cost you your soul
[1:16:46] you let folks say what they say do what
[1:16:50] they want
[1:16:50] you know what i'm saying and you just
[1:16:53] love them
[1:16:54] i was telling the pastor of the day he
[1:16:56] said so-and-so
[1:16:57] so it's on this i said don't mess with
[1:17:00] that we ain't got time
[1:17:02] we're too old to be messing with stuff
[1:17:04] if it's a mess let it
[1:17:06] you know leave it alone let god handle
[1:17:09] that
[1:17:09] work it out see what i'm saying but
[1:17:12] sometimes you
[1:17:13] you want to you want to tangle with
[1:17:14] stuff i said sometimes you might make it
[1:17:16] messier than what it is
[1:17:18] so sometimes you leave it in the hand of
[1:17:20] the law
[1:17:22] and let's see how let's let god handle
[1:17:24] stuff
[1:17:26] you know let's not just jump in
[1:17:27] something
[1:17:29] because you can be jumping in what you
[1:17:31] know
[1:17:32] he said oh okay okay i'll do that see
[1:17:35] that's what we got to do
[1:17:37] a lot of things we got to pray that god
[1:17:40] can handle it better than you can
[1:17:42] pray hard pray like you got
[1:17:45] you want to answer real like you want
[1:17:48] god to come on the scene
[1:17:50] you know you can pray that god changed
[1:17:51] somebody and god might end up changing
[1:17:53] you
[1:17:55] amen you might think that person wrong
[1:17:59] but you got to be honest and sincere and
[1:18:01] loving them
[1:18:02] and you love them enough and you pray
[1:18:05] for them enough and you love them
[1:18:07] god if if you wrong god straighten you
[1:18:10] out
[1:18:10] if they're wrong god can change them you
[1:18:13] love them
[1:18:14] keep loving them okay
