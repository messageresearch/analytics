thee therefore before God in the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearance and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exalt with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into favors but watch thou in all things andure Affliction do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of your ministry God bless the read word you may be SE Paul was saying that I'm ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand and he's talking about his F fight he said I fought a good fight i' uh I finished my course what God called me to do and I have kept the faith and then he talks about henceforth there is laid up for me a crown righteousness which the Lord our righteous judge should give me at that day and not to me only but all them also that love his appearance amen so we want to talk about sound Doctrine this it says uh we ought to speak those things which sound Doctrine sound Doctrine now we we we understand well men will not endure sound Doctrine see there's an endurance of sound Doctrine but men would not endure sound Doctrine because people are unstable people are not sound you know we talk about sound mind okay let's just go to um one chapter I mean chapter one verse 7 second Timothy 1 and 7 for God has not given us the spirit of what but of power and of love and of what sound healthy that which is good for you healthy but men would not endure sound Doctrine amen somebody and I thought about people in this age people are sick the church is sick the world is sick so he says here it says God has not given us the spirit of fear because of fear people are not sound but God has not giving us a spirit of fear we're living in a in an age where people just uh they they don't want to hear sound Doctrine they don't want to hear you tell them the truth amen amen they don't want to hear if you're not telling them what they want to hear then they they're find them someplace to go amen tell me what I want to hear it it doesn't matter what the word say they want you to tell them what they want to hear and if you're not telling them what they want to hear so long bye because everybody there's a see way that seem it right to a man but the end thereof is a way to just destruction amen amen people want what they think is right amen amen what seem right amen and what they think is right but the word of God Is Right amen for he says precept must be upon precept line upon line there little and here little so we must amen go by the word of God it says here in uh uh the eth verse it says be not therefore ashamed of my testimony of the the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoners but be thou partakers of the Affliction of The Gospel According to the power of God he said but be thy partakers of the afflictions of the Gospel see people don't want to suffer nothing you know if it cause a little pain or cause a little suffering uh-uh but he said be thou partakers you know as he talked to his son Timothy and uh and talking to us today be th partakers of the suffering we we have to suffer the rain amen we have to go through some things but people seem to be so uh fragile when it comes to the world they don't want to give up nothing amen but we have to be able we must be willing to give up the world Amen give up the car of this life am yes give up the pleasure amen he says in the ninth verse who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to what not according to our own works but according to his own what purpose God has his purpose in Christ not your purpose that's what we I don't know what's going on people just seem to think that I can do what I want to do how I want to do and if you don't if you don't let me do what I want to do then I don't God is not willing that any should perish and God is not going to force anybody to do what they don't want to do he said if you love me you'll keep my commandments so if you're not in love with God but you love the world then by all means but I think God has done enough for us that we ought to love him amen we ought to appreciate what he's done for us us [Applause] am he's already proved his love amen he already proved that he cares for us amen yes it says that God has his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the when World began before the world began God had a purpose and and he's given this purpose to us before the world ever begin amen before the world begin God had a purpose for you amen yes and he said be now partakers of this Affliction amen see because what God has for you that's in Christ you know God had something in for the children of Israel but it was in the promised land but while they were in Egypt amen they could not amen and they could not be blessed with the promised land honey and milk and the things that God had there they had to leave Egypt to get there amen people want the blessings that are in Christ but they don't want to leave the world Amen and become be in Christ amen the blessings are in the promised land amen the blessings that God promised you not in the world Amen so you not of this world you don't amen because the world have you know all the Glamour and all the the the the the movie Styles ball Styles and all of this glamour your stuff that's not your promise amen all your blessings are in the

us a purpose amen a purpose for living amen a purpose for your journey here amen are you with me amen he says has given us in Christ Jesus before the world Hallelujah it just didn't start it before the world began am amen so he says here in the 10th verse but is now made manifested by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who has what death don't it don't you don't have to worry about dying because he's abolished death for you amen praise God he's abolished death and has bought the life and what immortality immortality to the light through through the gospel amen see what I'm saying the promised land in Christ he's brought life and immortality but you can't have immortality amen when you still in sin when you in the world and the things of the world immortality it lies within Christ so God wants to give you immortality eternal life immortality this Mortal is going to pass away this Mortal life it's going to soon be over amen so brothers and sisters amen God gives you immortal life amen amen immortality amen praise God this model must put on immortality this corruptable must put an incorruption amen this thing here got got to change but if it's it's all in Christ when you're in Christ amen that's what makes the difference when you're in him amen you don't have to worry you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be fearful amen amen amen I'm talking about sound Doctrine praise God you got to be sound in the mind to receive sound Doctrine amen cuz he said let this mind be in you that was in Christ amen amen God has given us a sound mind not the spirit of fear but a love and a power and of a sound mind am I'm talking about sound Doctrine amen amen doctrine that cannot be condemned amen praise God the world can't handle this am but you made for this amen that's why you came this way amen you came to be tested and tried am but you going to come forth as pure gold hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah well don't like it Immortal immortality to the light through the gospel that's what the gospel is offering you amen wherefore I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for which cause I suffer these things nevertheless I'm not what ashamed I'm not ashamed for I what I I know whom I have believed and I am what persuaded am persuaded that he is what able to keep that shake somebody hand say he's able to keep that which I've committed committed amen if you haven't committed commit your life to him committed to him he's able to keep that which I committed unto him against that day he said hold fast the form of what sound Words which thou has heard of me in faith and in what love in love which is in Christ amen amen I want you to hold fast amen this this sound Doctrine amen now I want to go

children amen amen I love you I died for your sins and I love you but you're not considering he said all oh look at the America all a what sful nation y'all believe that he talked about Israel a

families to repent God is calling for repentance but those amen that know amen if we can repent and turn from our Wicked ways God would have mercy amen God would spare but we realize the as a miracle has gone too far amen so we want to go back to Second Timothy 1 amen and see amen that second Timothy 1:7 again for God has not given us spirit of fear but a power and love and of a sound mind am when I talked about amen restoring order I said the church is out of order amen every the the school is out of order everything is out of order amen it's chaotic out here amen the world Amen has gone so far in the darkness the wickedness of man has gone so far to go God is saying amen amen time is coming to his end the wickedness of man God is angry with the wicked every day God is saying I've given you space to repent amen turn now if we don't turn the wrath of God will be pulled out God is angry with the wicked every day it's time to turn from sin but what is it men love pleasure the spirit speak it expressedly in the latter days what men would do amen there'll be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God but somebody got to speak some sound Doctrine amen got to speak to the people that can hear what the word is saying amen God talked to Isaiah and told him amen that the amen the whole heart is sick amen and there's no soundness in it amen I'm saying God says amen who going to
