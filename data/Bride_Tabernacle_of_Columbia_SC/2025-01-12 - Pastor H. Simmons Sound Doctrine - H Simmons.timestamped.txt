[35:03] church is sick the world is
[35:06] sick so he says here it
[35:10] says God has not given us the spirit of
[35:15] fear because of fear people are not
[35:19] sound but God has not giving us a spirit
[35:22] of
[35:23] fear we're living in a in an age where
[35:26] people just
[35:29] uh they they don't want to hear sound
[35:31] Doctrine they don't want to hear you
[35:33] tell them the truth amen amen they don't

[36:24] there little and here little so we must
[36:27] amen go by the word of God it says here
[36:33] in uh uh the eth verse it says be not
[36:38] therefore ashamed of my testimony of the
[36:42] the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his
[36:46] prisoners but be thou partakers of the
[36:50] Affliction of The
[36:52] Gospel According to the power of God he
[36:56] said but be thy partakers of the

[37:02] don't want to suffer
[37:05] nothing you know if it cause a little
[37:08] pain or cause a little suffering uh-uh
[37:11] but he said be thou partakers you know

[37:21] of the suffering we we have to suffer
[37:23] the rain amen we have to go through some
[37:26] things but people seem to be so uh

[37:32] don't want to give up nothing amen but
[37:34] we have to be able we must be willing to
[37:37] give up the world Amen give up the car
[37:40] of this life am yes give up the pleasure

[37:51] says in the ninth verse who has saved us
[37:57] and called us with a holy calling not
[38:02] according to
[38:04] what not according to our own works but
[38:07] according to his own what
