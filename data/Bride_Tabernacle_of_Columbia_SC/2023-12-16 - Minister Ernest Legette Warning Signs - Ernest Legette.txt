many blessings that you've given us for Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the Book of Amos by the grace of God tonight very familiar scripture we try not to be before you long amen Amos 3 and 7 Amos 3 and 7 we got it say amen and it reads well it's I want to start first verse Amos 3 and one hear hear this the word that the Lord has spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I have brought up out of the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed when a lion roar in the forest when he have will a lion roar in the forest when he have no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon upon the Earth where no genin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken Nothing At All Shall the trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the Lord have not done it surely the Lord God would do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets the lying the lion ha roared who will not fear the lord ha spoken who shall not but prophesy may God is the Blessed you reading of his word tonight by the grace of God we just want to minister on warning signs amen this a little something that the Lord put on our heart you know and I I said you know what is a warning sign you know a warning sign is is something you know that lets you know that danger is ahead or it gets your attention to prepare for something that's up that's upcoming so we want to talk about warning signs you know I was thinking about you know it's a lot of things in this life that that give off warning signs but you know it's up to that individual to take heed to the warning right was thinking about you know how we go through these baller schools and and stuff at work and how they sent us to the baller school and and uh you know they it it they tell you to see the warning signs they tell you to to be able to uh train you to be able to look at stuff that even the the digital gauges might not pick up you know certain sounds certain things and and then certain visual things you might see so far as like in the sight glass that's the number one thing if you don't see water in the sight glass they said don't even think about it just run they got eops by every door hit the East stop and run fast as you can so and you know you learn to to take heed to those warning signs cuz if you don't you're taking a big risk or a gamble with your life because you didn't heed the warning signs but the warning signs that God give out is more than just taking a gamble with your life it's taking a gamble with your soul and that's one thing we don't want to take a gamble with because in that place you'll never you can't get that back when you take that gamble right so you know we want to talk about warning signs I like how you know Amos here prophesying and he was saying you know out of you have I you have I known out of all the families of the Earth you know I thought about that and he's saying you know so I'm going to punish you but the reason why God loved him so much and his love you know stretched out towards them and he just couldn't stand to see them disobey his word or disobey his will right and he was beginning to say you know I brought you up out of Egypt out of all the families have you have I known out of all the families of the earth God did extra extra for those and took away Vineyards and cities and all that they didn't build and Vineyards they didn't plant and all and gave it to them not because of they were like he said the greatest because you were the smallest not because you this it was only because God chose to elect he elected them he chose them to be his people so it was only by his grace and that's why you know he couldn't stand to see them you know uh uh do certain things but you know one of the things that that you know Amos was saying here he saying you know can two walk together except they they be agreed you know and many of times we don't want to we don't want to um think about that and that's that's coming with your family your friends no matter who it is to can't walk together except they be in agreement you know and sometimes we we think that you know uh this scripture might not apply in this situation that situation but one somebody going to compromise somebody you know I was ministering one time on on uh two masters you can't serve two masters the Bible says you going to love one you going to hate the other right so you can't it's no uh middle of the road in that aspect but you got to make it up in your mind who you going to serve you know whether you going to serve the Lord you don't serve the Lord ain't but one other one other place ain't it one other to be a servant of right sin but I want to say make up in your mind tonight you know who you want to serve come on because I I don't know about you but it's in my heart to serve the Lord you know I said God I pray all the time I said Lord you brought us this far you didn't bring us this far to leave us you didn't call us uh way back at that time and and brought us through all that we've been through to leave us out here I don't believe that but the devil put things in your mind sometimes to to have you because what it is in your Christian Journey your fire done been dying out done getting cold and lukewarm or you don't come to a place the way you relaxed and then you feel as though at that because everything is easy right but that's why God comes to stir up the the the nest stir up the pot sometimes to to see what you going to do he already know what you going to do but I says God you know in all those things we you know at this hour that we live in it's not an hour like we always say of relaxation we can cry that scream that pray that holler that out you know but it's got to take something it's got to take something within you or or letting you know that hey you need to check up your soul salvation you need to make your calling election sure because things are right here on the edge the whole world knows that y we know that tonight the whole world knows that the Nations know that everybody as I was saying the other night I was talking to brother Simmons who was saying uh how they putting all the pressure on uh uh uh uh Biden now to to try to and then him and uh uh Nan now they had little tensions because they want them to to tell Israel to stop they want them to quit backing those all you know and everybody want to come against them what is it we at the right now the at the break of Nations breaking up right the UN breaking up everybody going their own ways because they choosing sides right but I say is that the only side we can choose tonight that I know that's going to be a sure Foundation is with the word hallelujah is with God that's the only you know that's the only safe place I know I was telling somebody my testimony today of of of the Lord and how that's the only safe place I know that's the only place that I found rest at when when I was in a a a rut in a mess and I and I was in a bad place that's the only place that I found rest at I found it when I got down on my knees and I cried out to God and I asked God to help me you know when everything else is around you but I had to get away from all the noise all the other noise and all the other things had to get away from them and get along with God and hear his voice and he he's got a voice and he's still speaking but but it's so many other voices it's so much other noise out there that it's hard to hear God's voice in this hour it's hard to hear him calling many times I was I saying the other day to the church I I says that the preacher ain't picking at you I says you've been asking God to help you deal with that situation or give you the answer and the man of God come he delivered the word preach the word but it ain't the answer that you was looking for it wasn't what the way you thought it was going to be but then you just took it and throw it off or whatever but what it was you couldn't hear the voice of God because your own voice your your own thoughts and ideas was clouding out the voice of God so when it came you said it ain't that ain't God's voice but God's voice a lot of time goes against the grain doesn't it Jesus when he was praying he says Lord if it be possible let this cup pass but not my will let thy will be done and what was his will saying he said Lord I come in the volume of the book is written to me to do thy will in the midst of all what is going it's written of me to do your will this is a hard road ahead of me this is you know the road that we got ahead I don't believe it's no light Road I believe we see the warning signs of Destruction ahead I see we see the but even in that we going to look up why because we know that our Redemption is drawing nigh we see the warning sign so what are we doing we look for the sign of his coming hallelujah oh Jesus but we find I says I says the warning sign many times we don't heed it but God always sends warning before judgment you know a lot of times you know the prophet of God is bringing out people that left here they say oh they didn't know nobody knew they didn't have a warning or they had a warning he saying that you know everybody left here at some form or fashion or way God let them know to get your house in order just as he told Hezekiah he'll say get your house in order cuz you're going to die in some form of fashion now whether that person heed the warning or not that's going to be between them go and God but it was more than just strange happenings or coincidences because it is not so with God God has all of our steps uh planned all of our days all that those those things numbered things catch us by surprise but they don't catch God by surprise so what it is that's why we cry Lord I might not know what's up the road tomorrow but I know you know so I'm asking you to keep me in your will I'm asking you that when tomorrow if I wake up tomorrow by your grace Lord whatever my ambitions I might have plans for tomorrow but whatever is coming tomorrow though my plans if they're not in your will I don't want those plans but God when I wake up in the morning let my mind be in say lord it's written me to do your will I want your will how many want to do the will of God tonight now God's will is going to go against your will it's going to go against what you want your ideas and what you thought about it some people got their whole lives planned out I had mine planned out at one time but you still make plans but the thing is you learn the the the as time go on to yield to God yield to his will I never would have saw myself doing what I'm doing now where I'm at right now never would have saw myself even ministering the gospel and that's you know God was dealing with your life but you couldn't see what was up the road but God already saw it only thing you learned to do was yield to God's will only thing you learned to do was put aside what you want to do your own pleasure and say Lord I want to do your will that's what you learn to do Hallelujah but I said surely you know uh h a God he gives us warning signs but many of times you know uh people don't want to accept don't want to accept the the warning signs that God it's all we can look all through the scriptures now we know that you know as many angles we could take it from but God always gave out warning signs things didn't just happen before any major happening happened on the earth we know that God will send a prophet the world don't want to believe that today why because everybody want to look at themselves and say he ain't no better than me I'm the one but it ain't that it's just the it's just the gift that God or the position that God called a man to no God don't got no respect to persons but he still got order he still got ways that he does things and whether the world don't want to look at it that way or receive it or not nevertheless that ain't going to stop the program of God hallelujah God Still's got a way of doing things you know in the in the days of uh of Noah you know that Ark was a true sign Overlook wasn't it it was a warning sign Noah was a warning sign in his generation it looked L crazy looked like it was was was out of out of the ordinary and that's what it was God does things out of the ordinary doesn't he he does that's how he does it out of the ordinary so why today we allow the devil to trick our minds to to look for the ordinary things we looking for the ordinary things we trying to figure out even when we hear certain things we try to figure out well how could that be how could that be because we're looking for some explanation to see how could that have happened but that's not how God operates God doesn't operate from that aspect but how does God operate God operates in the Supernatural he operates in the things that can't be explained he operates in the things that man don't have no understanding no knowledge of and that's what baffles the medical field that's what baffles the scientific field that's why many people can't believe it because they ain't have no e explanation for it they can't understand it but I don't know about you but God has done so much for me that was unexplained till I come to the point that I say I don't have to know how or be explained Lord I believe it and I'm I'm just resting on what you said you done enough already that all I got to do Lord I believe what you said you did enough already come on I said as he done enough for you already come on I was sharing uh like I said my testimony today and the guy kept cutting me off he kept saying oh oh he said Ernest that's a testimony Ernest the Lord been good to you and I said the thing about it is that's all it's been my whole life whole life's testimony is that God has been good to me you know I always like that little song of uh uh that brother Gordon sings it sometime it slipped my mind just now but he sings it sometime I guess I'm getting a little old but uh so glad I'm Yours Lord that's the song so glad I'm Yours Lord Lord so glad you found me and you set me free so glad that I'm Yours Lord come on not that he's mine but I belong to him Hallelujah but God God that's what he does he sends warning signs we know that Noah I'm trying to go along but we know that Noah was a warning sign many people walked right past that warning sign wasn't didn't they you know Moses you know he was a warning sign even in his generation but just as Noah was building the ark Noah couldn't do even though God the sign was there you couldn't still do what you want to do even though the the flood was coming you could have prepared for it any kind of way maybe they did I don't know you could have prepared for it in any kind of way but it was going only be one way that was going to withstand the flood it was going to only be one thing that was going to withstand the flood and that was the ark that Noah built and Noah didn't build that Ark under his own wisdom and guidance but it was under the instructions of almighty God and that was going to be the only thing that was going to withstand the Judgment that was coming on the earth come on God he ain't going to leave you now without a way of Escape that's what I like about God cuz even though the things is coming he still gives us a way of escape a way for you to get out of it a way for you to run for your life I like how in one place in the church AG he was talking about Escape ones I like how God always even though the darkest AG came he always give the people a way of Escape Hallelujah when the devil got hold on your life God give you a way of Escape Hallelujah God give you an Avenue to get out of there and run for your life aren't you glad that God gave you a way of Escape come on and how was it it was through the shed blood of what he done for you on Calvary you don't have to go to hell tonight you don't have to be bound by sin and out there and live that life you don't have to why because he paid the price that you and I can be free tonight a way of Escape is what he made for me Hallelujah and I want to choose that way come on oh Jesus come on we ain't bound we free tonight we escape the wrath that is to come we're not as those that don't have no hope people say oh you talking about it's going you ought to be scared no we escaping it why because we're in what the instructions that God has given us I thank God we're able to take heed to those instructions get in the word and stay there and be ready when Jesus come Hallelujah not in the church but in the word so many people in church but you got to get in the word the word got to be in you you and the word got to become one Hallelujah I like how you know the other night brother Simmons was saying something we was talking about the elect and he was saying how the you know that the the you know was reading in studying how many people see the word and they and they they see it and they can know it's the truth but yet they still won't live it yet they'll still reject it come on and I was saying that what it is I said in your heart sometimes you don't want to believe that that people don't see it you want to believe in your heart that they really don't see it but because iniquity is in them because of iniquity they know to do right but they won't do it you know I like the look at that scripture sometimes how Jesus was talking about men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil they know that the light is better for them they know they can draw a a a a a strength from the light they know that things grow in the light they know there's healing in the light but they don't want it why because their deeds are evil and they don't want to give up those evil Deeds do they they don't want to give up that boy friend like we say or that girlfriend or that alcohol or whatever it is they don't want to give it up so they rather stay in darkness cuz if you ain't walking in the light as he is in the light you in dark Hallelujah but nevertheless I say I like on brother s was saying the other night that no the elect what the elect will do no matter how much the word goes against and hurts them no matter how much the word goes against their will and what they want to do and hurts their their flesh they ain't they they going to still yield to the word no matter how much pain they going through they going to yield to it no matter how much suffering they got to go through they'll yield to it why cuz they got no other choice greater is he that's in you and he's drawing on you you can't help but to let go hallelujah it's in your heart and God put it there I believe that come on but sometimes you want to believe that people don't they don't really see it or understand it but they have eyes and still can't see ears and can't hear but he said blessed are y'all eyes because you see and blessed are your ears because you hear you know it's a blessing that you can hear the word of God and become subject to it it's a blessing out of all of your friends sometimes excuse me all of your friends all of your family it's a blessing that you can hear the word and and your desires change Hallelujah you having thinking you're having fun one day you might think you're on top of the world but all of a sudden your desires begin to change you've been hearing the word and things been changing on the inside of your appetite changed people don't understand what's going on with you you don't know what's going on with you but God know what's going on with you God knew you out of you have he known out of all the people in the earth God knew you Hallelujah your desires your appetite begin to change you want to hold back but that it don't do nothing sometime but bring more pain on you it's easier to let go and just say God here it is feed me Lord I'm hungry oh Jesus I'm thirsty give me all that well to drink Hallelujah that I won't thirst no more oh Jesus how many want that well tonight but I thank God I don't know about you but I'm still hungry I'm still he is my satisfying portion but I want God more and more of God every day I want more and more of his Spirit every hour and say I need thee Lord I need thee you know I was singing that little song to myself Lord whatever you're doing in this season don't do it without me warning signs are all around us you know the disciples asked Jesus they said we thought El lias was going to come first he said he it came but you did show to him whatsoever you listed and you didn't know him right they missed the warning sign what was the warning sign he said that one was going to he going to be crying in the wilderness right voice one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord he came and they even asked him and he told him I'm not the Messiah I'm just the one the voice of one crying in the wilderness the sign came but they overlooked the sign didn't they they didn't want to they didn't want to admit admit that John was a sign the voice they didn't want to admit that what he was speaking was the prophecy they were looking for they didn't want to admit that why because it looked crazy didn't it he looked crazy looked fanatical don't you know I believe that even today signs and wonders happening people ain't going to believe it sitting in church they ain't going to believe it they going to doubt it why because it's going to look fanatical it ain't going to look like what you looking thinking about Hallelujah and it most might come sometimes through the most unlikely of people you'll say I thought there was going to be a a shaking I thought that you was going to ride that trail again I thought we was going to get the double portion it came you missed it hallelujah oh Jesus ain't that the Bible come on the prophet of God was saying that he was saying that it'll come it's going to pass right through through you he said it always did pass right through the right through but I said Lord whatever you're doing in this season don't do it without me I see the warning signs I feel it in my soul I know everybody knows things get shaking something is getting ready to happen Lord whatever you're doing in this season don't do it without me don't let me miss it Lord hallelujah I come this far by faith and I believe that God is going to take us on how many believe that tonight come on but we got all that we got it warning signs all around you the next thing you know many on that day Lord we didn't know we thought the signs were there you neglected to see it you didn't want to believe that that what it was but that's what it was people didn't want to believe Jesus did they even though Nicodemus said we know you a teacher come from God nobody can't do these things except God be with them they they willfully neglected the sign didn't they but nevertheless they had to come back round around to it and even in this hour and in the last day they'll come right back around to realize they crucified the very one they looking for Hallelujah the signs was there but the your forefathers rejected it sign come on we heard the word we hear it day in and day out don't reject the sign don't miss the hour come on oh Jesus but it'll pass through like the prophet of God was
