declare where two or three are gathered in my name that there I'd be in the midst Lord we thank you and we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of second Corinthians by the grace of God oh it's First Corinthians 2 . forgive me second Corinthians 11. I don't know how I got on mixed up second Corinthians 11. second Corinthians 11 and we'll begin at the first verse you got to say Amen and it reads what to God you you would bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealous for I have espoused you to one husband that I might present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguile Eve through this his subtility so your mind should be corrupt from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom ye have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted you might well bear with him for I suppose I was not a wit behind the very chiefest Apostles may God have Bless The Arena of his word he may be seated I'm going to read a little further down says but but though I'd be rude in speech yet and not in knowledge but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things have I committed an offense into basing myself that ye might be exalted because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely I robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service and when I was present with you and wanted I was charged with no man for that which was lacking to me the brother in which came from Macedonia supplied and in all things I've kept myself from being burdison burdensen unto you and so will I keep myself will drop down to the 13th verse and it reads for such are false or Prof false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore there's no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as a Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their Works God the blessing reading of his word again just for a quick moment it won't be long tonight I just want to just talk to you for a moment on and I entitle it ill filtration and disguises amen Hill filtration and disguises a little something I've been ministering on for the last couple of weeks and you know just kind of going over some things you know we're living in a hour of disguises we're living in an hour where you don't know what's real and what's fake because people got a way of disguising themselves right they can disguise themselves so much that a man can look just like a woman you don't even know the difference a woman look just like a man ain't it I remember me and uh Charlotte was that that McDonald's or somewhere one night and somebody walked by and and she said you know she looked and said that's a shame and I couldn't even tell it was a man it's that's scary ain't it but it's a way that they disguised themselves that's the hour that we're living in you don't know what's real and what's not you know and that's what you know I was thinking about you know we fighting the enemy that a lot of times you can't tell the enemy that you're fighting right that's why we need spiritual discernment more than anything a lot of times we try to discern things naturally but then we make a mess out of it don't it because I said you know I was thinking about it I said a lot of times what looks all the way right it might be wrong and what looks wrong could be right and all through the scriptures that's how that's how it was ain't it the things that didn't look like it was God it was God wasn't it I thought about John the Baptist a wild man coming out of the Wilderness right they're eating locusts and Wild Honey coming out there looked like he was crazy didn't it it didn't look right did it but it was right but then you might have seen uh Kai officer who all those in the in the in the robes and all that Whiteley robes and walking around doing it they look they're right didn't they come on but they were disguised but it's something about John the Baptist and Jesus they can look through those disguises and call them out for who they were right John I believe called them snakes and Vipers and all he says who who will warn you to flee the rap that's to come because even though you got a disguise I see exactly who you are and that's what God that's what the Holy Ghost is doing uh wants to do in our lives you know an hour that we live in you know we're fighting so many demon powers and some things look right but don't be right you know and they so sometimes a day so intellectual and things they come and they can make the make it sound so good right and then if you don't be careful you'll be deceived right along with everybody else because it looks right and even into intellectual mind it seems right but nevertheless it's something about the spirit of God you know we know that the word of God is powerful right it's quick it's sharper than any two-edged sword so what is the spirit what does the Holy Ghost in you he is the word he's going to produce the word he's going to be able to divide between the right and the wrong you might say it look right but something down on the inside of you the Holy Ghost is going to say it ain't right it's wrong it looks right but it ain't right and the thing is what he's doing that for he's keeping you from being deceived you know because in this hour of deception if it were possible it had deceive the very elect but God is keeping you and I from being deceived how by the Holy Ghost right and that's what it is you know the more that we're going on in this life and Christian Journey that's the more importance that you that you see that the need of the Holy Ghost because he's got to be the inside teacher you can hear the the man from behind the pulpit preaching and all but it may never get over but when the Holy Ghost comes he gonna teach you all things he gonna take the word and rightfully divide it and put it where it needs to be at and he's going to show you how to walk in it right and that's what it is so you know we find that it says infiltration and disguises you know made me think about a friend of mine Billy he fought in Vietnam and how he's saying the biggest problem was in Vietnam you didn't know who was who he says that you know they'd be out there mind sweeping for bombs and stuff and he says those children in the neighborhoods will be out there playing in the field running around people riding bikes all and they never got blowed up but the soldiers and all you know they're walking around they said it dawned on them one day that you know the reason why they ain't getting blowed up because they know where they're at they the ones planted them and then they you know the uh some of the Vietnamese was saying the problem with that war was you're looking for one bad guy and he said you might kill 10 good guys before you get to a bad guy and by doing that now you don't turn a bunch of the good ones in the bad ones because you you done you killed the wrong so it was a mess because you didn't know who was who they couldn't discern who was who so it was like a battle you fighting you don't you can't see your enemy you're making a mess out of it right so I thought about that you know just uh spiritually speaking thinking about it and I says that and and all that we live in we we fighting and like I said you don't even know sometimes what you fighting right but we know that we ain't wrestling Flesh and Blood now we know that a lot of times the problems come out you know people get mad with each other in the church or the preacher and all of that you know but behind the scenes it's the devil the whole time coming in there stirring up stuff bringing out confusion that's his job to bring confusion right to keep you from getting on one Accord because he knows the power of what'll happen when you get on one Accord so his job is to keep confusion keep things stirred up right and then we looking at this and we we think say we know we're not fighting flesh and blood but you're not realizing that it's the devil the whole time you know it's when we can realize a lot of things the devil you know the devil can anoint somebody that's Holy Ghost feel they can say or do things they ain't knowing what they're doing and saying right that's hard to believe sometimes but the devil might take I said the devil anoint him but he'll take something that they said or done and take it and twist it before it get to you and when it get to you it'll mess you all up right but that's what the devil wanted to do but I say it's one thing about it no matter what in this life we got to keep love in our hearts no matter what you know I was thinking you know something that Russell Simmons was saying when he's talking to my sister about her um leaving on and he was telling her no matter what he said he got to get love on your mind everything else there ain't nothing else gonna matter he says cause you got to get love there's nothing short of perfect luck on enter in that place so that's what that's what's going on what's going to matter but the devil Gonna Keep Us away from that ain't you come on but infiltration in disguises I said that's what Paul uh was talking about here that you know he was afraid he was saying I sponsored one husband I preached the word you know to you I I gave it to him he says but I'm afraid for you he said that that just like Satan beguiled Eve he gonna beguile you you know Satan I say how did he beguiler he came in using the disguise didn't he he came in so like he says with septility he came in the devil ain't somebody say the devil Rush rough hard and ravish you that's what he gonna do when he get in there but the thing is from the beginning that's not how you get in there how he gets in how does he get in the home subtility how does he get in a a family a relationship so Tilly he eased his way on there and don't he and when he gets in there you know that's when he shows true colors you know thinking about you know how how Adam and Eve and and was in the garden and you know God made everything good it was living in we could say it was Paradise everything was beautiful right but Satan found a way to ease his way on in there didn't he he didn't come out showing you who he was from the beginning but he used a disguise he he came in uh in the serpent infiltrated didn't he that when he was there came talking to Eve she couldn't see uh past that disguise she couldn't see past that what he was hiding behind right but when he came in I said when the first thing when he came in the first thing he did was attack the word didn't he that's the first thing he did was to take the word because he knew that it that the word you she was fortified I would say today the devil know that you fortified behind the word right as long as you in the word come on like this you sang that song get in the word and stay there and be ready when Jesus comes come on not in the church but get in the word come on girl that's your hiding place a lot of times people think the church or their family friendships hide in place come on that ain't that ain't gonna rescue you a savior you got to know the Lord for yourself I was sharing with somebody that the other day I said no matter how good of your parents are no matter how good or or great works that they did you're gonna have to know to God for yourself I says you can go with them so far but when it comes down to going up to Calvary or going behind that Veil you're gonna have to go alone God gonna hold you accountable for your own works come on so what we do we search ourselves and say Lord you know do I have us out only these things but God I'm going to do what your perfect will is but that's what happened I would say Satan he came in didn't he infiltrate disguise Eve didn't know but the first thing he did he attacked the word right and got her all mixed up in her mind are all entangled confused now right to wait she started hearing things that was completely wrong but it sounded right didn't it sounded something that she can reason with right and then all of a sudden now she's beginning to believe what what was a lie you can believe it as a truth now because Satan came in right sometimes I say what we got to do is look at ourselves and see look at your Christian Journey your Christian walk you got to look at yourself and say God where am I at come on because what it is it like brother Jeremiah is preaching on the drifting because I was I thought that was the Lord because I ministered on that about three weeks ago uh just the same topic of drifting I said you don't know I was using an example about how once we were at the beach and had the little children with us and I was out there playing with them in the water and next thing you know when I look back I didn't realize how far we were out there but I realized every time the waves came in that little ruffling that you feel under the bottom of your feet it was it was the ocean pulling you on out though gradually you know dragging you you was drifting it didn't all come at once but under your feet it was something pulling you out there and you ain't even realize that you don't move that far out till you look back and you say man I'm a long ways away you say what we didn't know that but what it was it was a drifting that got you there come on SO and that's what it is the devil don't the devil don't just come like but it starts to little things right little the little thing the next thing you know you so far out there then you get confused come on you get confused you ain't been studying the Bible like you're supposed to you ain't been praying like you're supposed to so the more the more that happens he start injecting all kind of stuff in your spirit injecting all kind of stuff when you in your walk and then next thing you know you find yourself way out there confused the things you didn't you should do you're doing them now right but I say it's what it is that that's a call for each and every individual to check up themselves not parting the fingers nobody got the time to point the finger at nobody we all need eyes open we all need God to do something in our lives to help us stay the course because now the hour that we live in you know it can happen any moments anytime anything can happen at any time right so we need God to help us stay the course we need God I was looking at the something the other day where they said California had this big earthquake and people got hurt and stuff like that but I said you know what that was way down on the in the news article right but we hearing it so much and it don't even mean nothing now do it we're hearing it we even have an Earthquakes ourselves don't mean nothing to it because it's so common come on but the thing is one day the big one coming and it ain't gonna be there I want to get ready come on but you know he wants you to be ready when he comes I don't know about you but I want to be ready when the Lord comes when he called my name I don't want nothing to hold me down you talk with people sometimes and say you know you've been running this race for a long time you ain't got but a little while left a little mile to go come on even if you have 50 years that ain't but a little mile compared to Eternity right so stay the course amen but it says infiltration in disguises come on that's how the Devil comes in don't he Paul like we says he he says I'm fearing you know unless Satan beguile you didn't begin to talk about you know how I want you to be aware of false apostles and teachers and all this he says you know that even the devil Satan himself will show himself as an angel of Light right so if he does that then how much more of his ministers will do the same thing so he wanted to let you know that you know you got to be aware of these things aware of the disguises and the tricks and the schemes of the devil come on you got to be able to see see through it how are you going to be able to see through it by the Holy Ghost you know I was looking at uh one thing I was sharing with somebody I said you know what it is I said you know when you're born again uh you know we always talk about being born again now you're taking on the nature of God the genes of God and all that like that and the curse has been broken off your life you know generational curses and things like that so when the Holy Ghost comes in he he breaks all those curses and all so now you you on the you're on a good path now you're on the but I said even in all of that you still got you still got stuff you got to battle even in all that you still got demons you got to fight yeah yes you come into a place to where you know you're on the right path and God is taking over but you still got it's still stuff in you that's in your nature that you born with that's got to be held at Bay it's still people say oh no you get the Holy Ghost today but it is Paul says when I desire to do good he said what evil is present with me he talked about a war that he's fighting every day in his members right said I want to do right but it's something in me it's flesh this flesh shall never be redeemed come on but it's corrupt corrupt it ain't it Desiring the things of the world it's designed certain things but I say is what it is you know even though even though when you born again you still got about you still got things in there but what the Holy Ghost does he'll harness those things what the Holy Ghost does he keeps those things at Bay those things that you know you that tries to affect you somebody say your granddaddy was just where your mama was this way or whatever it might have been but you know what the Holy Ghost does he knows how to harness those things he knows how to harness them and keep you and walking in the right path right So I says that but what it is you got to let him have his way in your life you got to let him work people say this I always been like this when it's time for change it's time to change and let God like we always talk about you get married you know it's a lot of changes when you get married there's a lot of them somebody's oh you can't be the same You Gonna Change sooner or later right but change is good ain't it because God God gives you the right mate to help perfect you too I believe that what I say is that what it is you know but but we got to realize what the devil does right how he comes in how he disguised himself but look looking at looking at all he's saying let's say we didn't want to be long the reason why I always say the reason why history repeats itself because it's the same two Spirits fighting each other it's the same Powers right they just using different bodies now they got different disguises now because it just says Satan uses disguises God knows how to disguise himself too enclose himself and hide himself but you know what I'm saying like they need a body to work in come on y'all believe that tonight but to be able to to see it I believe that and I said that's what you know what we fighting or what we dealing with today you know I said God I want to be able to see you I want to I want to be able to see you God you know I said what happens a lot of times people when they can't when they don't see the word being produced in their life you know they'll talk about somebody else that the word is being revealed in their life or they'll Envy them they'll even go so far as sometimes they call it witchcraft for the devil you say they won't do it but they did Jesus that way didn't they what do they say they call him Beelzebub they say if he call them that what are they going to call you right because they didn't see the The Life of Christ uh being produced in their life but what I say is what it is you know if if the literal Life of Christ is in you it's got to be the supernatural you're a supernatural being looking for miracle signs and wonders looking for the inevitable the things to happen right it's a it's a yearning inside of you for more of God I need more of you come on because I know and that's what it is no matter no matter how the devil disguised himself or even God disguise himself their nature will be the same come on you know you'll know a tree by the way fruit it bear no matter what that nature will be the same right so when you say God in you the nature his nature Ain't Gonna Change he gonna be the same right come on God in Me Lord sometimes you say Lord where's the power come on not that you just want to show yourself high and mighty or Head and Shoulders above everybody else but the thing is you need it you need it right now you need it for healing salvation you know it's God's savior a lot a lot of situations you need it a lot of situations come up you need a miracle right and that's when you know you call out like like I believe it was getting said if God be with us then wear all his miracles at right come on when I say oh this that you you push it sometimes push things on the back side of the back burner but what it is that's the devil doing that you know why he does that he wants you to be cold and formal he wants you to be a regular Church going in Clapping Your Hands singing and going out no power come on professing the word but denying the power of he wants you to fall in that group but there is a group that won't just profess it and deny the power come on but they'll walk into power because they yield themselves to it and God did it work y'all believe that I always say God you know in our Christian Journey God always does things always does something and then sometimes you always say you go a little while but then God you cry out sometimes or something happened God does things to to let you know I'm still here I ain't going nowhere I'm still the same I'm still listening to you I'm still right here and what that does that even though in the darkest of nights when it seemed like you can't hear the voice of God your faith ain't shaken because you had experiences on the backside of the Wilderness somewhere like David now the line I Fought The Lion and the bear he just has one of those come on God has been too good to me too real to me that and all these things you know I was sharing the other day I said you know and we I know we hear it all the time but no matter what happens in your life remember the devil can't do no more than you than what God allowed he can't do no more I said I was sharing with the church the other day I said you know how I'm gonna start looking at these situations is God you working on me situations come say God you working on me come on pray for me now because God working on me I'm going through yes but God is working on me he said how can you say it like that because every trial a tribulation situation that I've been through it might have been hard some of them might have been hard but when you look back you start a hand to God in all of it come on when you came out even if it was a chastisement or whatever God brought you through you came out better than you was when you went in because God was working on you he wanted to show you some things about yourself that he wanted to iron out come on get it out of the way Hallelujah and we thank God for that for growth right thank God for growth because growth brings about it's a victory doesn't it growth brings about a stableness in your life that ain't where I used to be come on might not be where I want to be I'm still trying to obtain but I'm growing Hallelujah I'm stronger today than I was yesterday the things that battle me and and I've had to fight against I don't have to fight against him no more because God has given me the strength to defeat him and I ain't got to live like that Hallelujah but I'm going on to the deeper things in God I'm going on to a place to where a little bicker and Ark and all those things don't affect you but we moving higher in God to the place to where hey we got real demons and Devils to fight we heard about somebody said this somebody don't care about you all these other things come on we moving on to places to the climax of the battles Hallelujah oh Jesus come on y'all believe that tonight I don't want to be long as I said I'm going to run through it all but infiltration in Disguise see what the devil does like I said hey he comes in and he disguises himself right we get you all off course if it were possible to see the very elect says don't be surprised he's going to show himself as a as an angel of life and his ministers his his demons they're
