[36:42] God Malachi 3 try not to be long tonight
[36:48] amen Malachi 3
[37:04] you got to say
[37:06] amen and it reads we'll start here at
[37:08] the seventh verse and it reads even from
[37:12] the days of your father ye are going
[37:14] away from my in ordinance and have not
[37:17] kept them return unto unto me and I will
[37:22] return unto you sayeth the Lord of hosts
[37:26] but ye have but ye said wherein shall we
[37:30] return will a man rob God yet ye have
[37:33] robbed me but ye say wherein have we
[37:37] robbed thee in tithes and offering you
[37:39] may be seated read a little further
[37:43] down he
[37:45] says Where have you robbed where wherein
[37:48] have we robbed thee in tithes and
[37:50] offerings ye are cursed with a curse for
[37:54] ye have robbed me even this whole nation
[37:57] bring ye all the tithes into the
[38:00] storehouse that there may be meat in
[38:03] mine house and prove me now herewith
[38:06] sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not
[38:09] open the windows of heaven and pour you
[38:12] out a blessing that there shall not be
[38:15] room enough to receive to receive it and
[38:18] I will rebuke the devour for your sakes
[38:21] and he shall not destroy the fruits of
[38:23] your ground neither shall your Vine cast
[38:27] her fruit before the time in the field
[38:30] sayeth the Lord of hosts and All Nations
[38:33] shall call you blessed for ye shall be a
[38:37] delight delightsome land sayth the Lord
[38:40] of hosts your words have been Stout
[38:43] against me say the Lord yet ye say what
[38:47] have we spoken so much against thee ye
[38:50] have said it is vain to serve God and
[38:54] what prophet is it that we have kept his
[38:56] ordinance and that we have walked
[38:58] mournfully before the Lord of hosts and
[39:01] now we call the proud happy yay they
[39:05] that work wickedness are set up yay they
[39:08] that tempt God are even delivered then
[39:12] they that fear the lord spake often one
[39:15] to another and the Lord hearkened and
[39:18] heard it and a book of remembrance was
[39:20] written before him for them that feared
[39:24] the Lord and that thought upon his name
[39:28] and they shall be mine sayth the Lord of
[39:30] hosts in that day when I make up my
[39:33] jewels and I will spare them as a man
[39:36] spareth his own son that serveth him
[39:40] then shall ye return and discern between
[39:43] the righteous and the wicked between him
[39:46] that serveth God and him that serveth
[39:49] not may God had a blessing reading of
[39:51] his
[39:52] word tonight just for a moment I want to
[39:55] minister on a little topic and I
[39:57] entitled it blessings and cursings a and
[39:59] curses amen blessings and curses you
[40:03] know you look you know everybody in
[40:06] their lifetime desires to be blessed
[40:08] right but God and God wants to bless you
[40:13] God wants to bless each and every one of
[40:14] us right so he gives us ways you know I
[40:19] mean he gives us a room he makes room to
[40:22] bless us but a lot of times we we don't
[40:25] be blessed a lot of lot of times people
[40:28] fall on the cursed side but it's because
[40:30] of their own accord it's not because God
[40:32] desires to do that but they finds
[40:35] themselves out of the program of what
[40:38] God wants right so I says you know what
[40:41] is a blessing you know a blessing when
[40:44] you talking about blessings you talking
[40:46] about God's Divine favor over your life
[40:50] talking about you know God's Divine
[40:53] favor and protection over you that's
[40:56] what when we we look at blessings that's
[40:58] what we're looking at I'm when you say
[40:59] I'm blessed I mean I'm looking at it as
[41:02] God's I've got God's Divine favor amen
[41:05] hallelujah not only his favor but his
[41:08] protection as well that's right you say
[41:10] how how how you know you blessed I'm
[41:12] blessed because God says I'm blessed
[41:14] amen see circumstances don't determine
[41:17] how where God going to B how God going
[41:20] to bless you or if God is going to bless
[41:21] you only thing that's going to determine
[41:23] that is the life that you live amen if
[41:26] you still walk in and living faithful
[41:28] before God no matter where you are no
[41:30] matter what situation you might find
[41:32] yourself in you'll be blessed in it amen
[41:35] amen because God says you blessed amen
[41:38] you know we got so many uh characters in
[41:40] the Bible that we can look at but I was
[41:42] thinking about you know uh for one
[41:44] Joseph no matter where he went he was
[41:47] blessed people hated him they wanted to
[41:50] curse him but you can't curse what God
[41:52] bless can you and and in even in those
[41:56] situations those time times maybe in
[41:58] those hard times when he was in that pit
[42:00] after his brothers uhh throw him in
[42:02] there then he got sold but you know he
[42:04] never lost his faith uh Faith with God
[42:07] he never lost his stance and uh that I'm
[42:10] here and I'm done unjustly but I believe
[42:13] his life was still pleasing unto God so
[42:16] no matter where he went he could still
[42:18] be blessed because of the life his life
[42:20] was pleasing unto God amen amen you know
[42:23] I was I was praying the other day and I
[42:25] was saying Lord that's what I want I
[42:27] says you know I want to walk with you

[42:52] wisdom above all I was saying you know
[42:55] you know we know that the bride need
[42:57] discernment but wisdom and discernment
[43:00] work together I says Lord I I want more
[43:03] I want wisdom on on how to handle every
[43:07] situation amen amen you know and and the
[43:10] Lord I was I was sitting there praying
[43:12] the other morning and I was praying I as
[43:14] my prayer every day God I want wisdom I
[43:17] know situations going to happen today I
[43:18] know things are going to take place and
[43:20] God I don't want to react how I feel or
[43:23] how I think that I should react in that
[43:25] moment that's right amen I don't want to
[43:27] take advice from somebody and it might
[43:30] sound so good but it be the wrong advice
[43:33] amen this is what you ought to do or
[43:35] this is how you ought to handle that
[43:37] situation and sometimes you know it
[43:40] might sound so good and it might seem
[43:42] like you ought to handle it that way but
[43:45] I says Lord I want your wisdom I want
[43:48] your mind I want your mind on this on
[43:50] every situation you they brought that
[43:52] woman to Jesus it says uh uh we caught
[43:55] her in the act this is what you going to
[43:56] do according to the law they knew what
[43:58] was supposed to happen right not only to
[44:01] her but the man but he didn't react that
[44:03] way what his reaction was was he among
[44:06] you without sin Let Him cast the first
[44:08] stone right come on somebody say well
[44:11] you know you Jes that was Jesus but I
[44:13] says the thing is at some places he
[44:15] reacted he he he acted that way and some
[44:17] places he reacted a different way but
[44:20] nevertheless I says God I don't want to
[44:23] just do what I feel is right or at the
[44:26] time but let me be led by your Holy
[44:28] Spirit God Amen that's my desire in all
[44:32] things because you know you can act
[44:34] wrong or you can say the wrong make the
[44:36] wrong advice get the wrong advice or
[44:38] make the wrong decision at a certain
[44:41] time and you can't go back and correct
[44:43] it amen or you could say the wrong thing
[44:45] give somebody the wrong advice you can't
[44:47] go back and change it it could be
[44:50] damaging to someone's life amen
[44:52] especially to of a person for people in
[44:56] power making decisions that's the wrong
[44:58] decisions it can be damaging in
[45:00] someone's life so you say God I want to
[45:02] be I want to live so close to you that I
[45:05] I just know what your mind is I know
[45:08] what your next what the next move is I
[45:10] know what the next move is you want for
[45:12] me God show and I believe that God can
[45:14] do that God is still working in
[45:17] Supernatural ways still showing visions
[45:20] and dreams and all these things to come
[45:23] that that's that that's up ahead but
[45:25] when you know you got to be spiritual
[45:27] minding you got to be in a place where
[45:28] God can show you but when it comes to
[45:31] you you got to you got to allow God to
[45:33] use you in that in that place amen come
[45:36] on I believe that with all of my heart
[45:38] but I says that that's what it is you
[45:39] know I've been praying in that way but I
[45:42] says everybody desires to be blessed
[45:44] right so we looking here at you know how
[45:47] the prophet prophesying and he was
[45:49] saying you know he was talking to that
[45:51] Nation he was saying uh he was saying
[45:53] you know will a man rob God a lot of
[45:56] times you know uh uh uh we know that
[45:58] this scripture might be widely used to
[46:02] uh uh get the people to uh give up all
[46:05] that money that's in the churches and
[46:07] stuff but nevertheless it's the Bible
[46:09] anyway he says you ought to pay your
[46:12] ties right because that's God's way and
[46:15] if you don't then you cursed you cursed
[46:18] with a what curse people say well no
[46:22] come on it's the it's the program of God
[46:24] reason why you don't pay your ti or you
[46:26] don't don't give your offering because
[46:27] you don't trust God you don't believe
[46:31] that God will bless you but what he says
[46:34] to you and I tonight and you know we
[46:36] don't preach money but what he says to
[46:38] you and I tonight prove
[46:40] me come on try me God is waiting to
[46:44] bless somebody yes sir amen God is
[46:47] waiting to open up the windows of Heaven
[46:49] for somebody but he says I want you to
[46:52] step out on faith and try me amen prove
[46:55] me and see what do you know a lot of
[46:58] times when we looking at blessings we
[47:00] thinking about money finances or we
[47:03] thinking about big houses cars that
[47:05] drive and all that but
[47:08] blessings sometimes can be just waking
[47:10] up in the morning feeling all right
[47:14] blessings come on could be that car
[47:17] wreck that God allowed a hedge to be
[47:19] around you and didn't allow a
[47:21] happen
[47:23] blessings come on Amen you know
[47:27] yesterday my my son Moses running into
[47:29] somebody mailbox with my wife
[47:32] car they sent
[47:34] the text and I saw the
[47:38] picture soon as I saw it it was late
[47:41] last night cuz I had to work over you
[47:43] know what all the boys at work said
[47:46] Ernest you better not be mad he says
[47:48] first thing you need to find out is is
[47:50] he
[47:51] hurt and if he ain't hurt you better be
[47:53] glad because he could have got hurt in
[47:55] an accident
[47:57] you know we start looking at things a
[48:00] little bit different
[48:02] right because I says God I'm must say
[48:07] God I've been praying Lord I need wisdom
[48:09] it's a lot of things since I've been
[48:11] praying that way took place and God
[48:13] wants you to respond or act in a certain
[48:15] way and I wouldn't want to do it but the
[48:17] Lord said I'm trying to give you what
[48:19] you asked for come
[48:21] on whatever you ask for God want to give
[48:24] it to you things it's character in your
[48:26] life God want to get out of you right
[48:29] but you can't tell God how to give it to
[48:31] you amen amen and you can't tell God how
[48:35] to teach you certain lessons come on
[48:38] God's got his own way and his way is
[48:40] sure he knows how to get the job done
[48:43] when he gets done teaching you you'll
[48:46] understand I believe that come on you
[48:49] know I stir me up the other day I was
[48:52] reading in the scriptures and how you
[48:55] know Jesus sat down with the at Matthews
[48:58] I believe Matthew house and all those
[49:00] and but the Pharisees and the scribes
[49:02] came up to his disciples and says why
[49:04] your master eating with Sinners and
[49:07] stuff but Jesus the Bible says Jesus
[49:09] heard him and he says unto them he says
[49:13] won't you go and learn what it means
[49:15] that I I I desire Hallelujah mercy and
[49:18] not sacrifice he said go learn what that
[49:21] mean come on he was talking to the
[49:23] preachers of that day wasn't he he was
[49:25] talking to the church Church of that day
[49:27] go learn what that mean come on ye that
[49:30] know the Bible ye that have learned come
[49:32] on he says that I was sent to to the
[49:35] sick not the whole come on to the called
[49:38] the Sinners to the repentance not the
[49:40] righteous I believe God is still saving
[49:43] Souls
[49:44] today sometimes we got to go and learn
[49:47] what the scriptures mean come on cuz we
[49:50] can take our own interpretation and all
[49:52] those things men can teach it a certain
[49:55] way but the Holy Ghost got to teach you
[49:58] what the scriptures mean Hallelujah
[50:01] other than that youve been taught by men
[50:03] but he says that you are no man to teach
[50:05] you the Holy Ghost when he come he'll
[50:07] teach you all things that's why you got
[50:09] to have a relationship with God not with
[50:12] the church not with the pastor not with
[50:14] the preacher that's all right but you
[50:16] got to have a relationship with God
[50:19] where you can get down on your knees in
[50:20] commune with him Lord what do you want
[50:23] on my life amen God what do you say to
[50:25] me God what that you trying to teach me
[50:27] that's what I want Hallelujah but that
[50:31] comes with a personal
[50:33] relationship and it's nothing like
[50:35] having that person
[50:36] relationship why because when you in
[50:39] trouble you know you got a friend you
[50:41] can run to you know what God what the
[50:44] voice of God is like because you talk to
[50:47] him every
[50:48] day
[50:50] hallelujah oh Jesus come on he says I'll
[50:55] bless you right
[50:57] come on so we says blessings ain't
[50:59] always just looking at money and houses
[51:01] and all those things but it's a lot of
[51:03] ways God blessing you right come on a
[51:06] lot of times we says we ain't blessed we
[51:08] curse because we curse ourselves come on
[51:11] you bring things on yourself a lot of
[51:13] times right you know I was looking over
[51:16] the scriptures and how he says blessed
[51:18] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[51:21] Mercy sometimes we don't get Mercy like
[51:23] we ought to from God but you need to
[51:25] examine your life amen
[51:28] hallelujah oh Jesus come on one thing he
[51:32] says that you ought to treat others as
[51:34] you would ought to be as you want to be
[51:36] treated right as you want others to
[51:38] treat you right you know one day I was
[51:40] laying on the couch and it came to me so
[51:42] clear I'll never forget a little voice
[51:45] came to me so clear this was years ago
[51:47] now he says to me you won't be judged on
[51:51] how how others treated you but you will
[51:55] be judged on how you treated others
[51:57] right amen come on when you come before
[51:59] God you can't have an account to say
[52:02] Lord I did this because of look at how
[52:04] they done me this is the why I reacted
[52:06] the way I reacted come on I don't
[52:09] believe you can go to God like that
[52:11] because there nobody can't treat you no
[52:13] worse than what they treated him come on
[52:16] and how did he react father forgive them
[52:19] for they know not what they
[52:20] do he reacted with love didn't he love
[52:24] in such a way that it was power love in
[52:27] such a way that something came out of
[52:29] that didn't it Hallelujah but that can't
[52:33] be uh uh imitated you can't make that up
[52:36] that's something that God got to give
[52:38] you oh no that's something that he got
[52:40] to do in your life come on and a lot of
[52:44] times it comes through trials and
[52:46] tribulations Hallelujah you beat down
[52:49] you talked about you walked over you
[52:51] looked over come on time and time again
[52:54] come on oh Jesus but God meant it for
[52:59] you good amen so you can walk humbly
[53:02] before him Hallelujah I thank God for
[53:05] the lessons that he teaches us how many
[53:08] thank God for that tonight
[53:11] Hallelujah but we fine I says come on
[53:14] blesses and curse God want to bless you
[53:16] tonight don't he come on I thank God I
[53:19] said Lord I want to be on the blessing
[53:20] side amen come on I want to be on a on
[53:23] on a side that's blessed don't you know
[53:25] God's Got so many blessings that he want
[53:28] to give out come on I thank God for all
[53:31] all the things you know I was looking at
[53:33] uh uh some of the you know looking at
[53:35] the scriptures and how you know here you
[53:38] know Malachi was going over telling them
[53:40] to try he he was saying uh prove me all
[53:43] but then he begins to say say here in
[53:45] the in the 11th verse I like this this
[53:47] in 11th verse he says and I will rebuke
[53:50] the devour for your sakes and he shall
[53:54] not destroy the fruits of your ground
[53:56] neither shall your Vine cast the fruit
[53:59] before the time in the in the field
[54:01] sayth the Lords of hosts when God bless
[54:04] you the devil can't take it away come on
[54:07] when God bless you I like how he says
[54:10] I'll bless the fruit of your ground I'll
[54:12] rebuke the devour for your sake amen
[54:15] come on when God is blessing the Devil
[54:17] can't do nothing with it am he'll rebuke
[54:20] them for your sake fruits coming up just
[54:23] like the midianites used to take them
[54:25] away from to Israel all the time but it
[54:27] came a time where God was going to put a
[54:29] stop to it come on Hallelujah God bless
[54:34] you don't worry about it His blessings
[54:37] don't add no Sorrows to it come on what
[54:40] happen when you bless yourself men come
[54:42] take it steal it don't they bring your
[54:45] sorrow heartache and pain but when God
[54:47] blesses you Hallelujah I'll rebuke the
[54:51] devour for your sake oh Jesus come on

[55:29] foundation that can't be moved When God
[55:33] says it that then you don't like it says
[55:35] God says as I believe it that settles it
[55:38] but God said it that settles it whether
[55:41] you believe it or not it's true
[55:44] anyhow oh Jesus I was in prayer the

[56:13] early in the morning it'll answer the
[56:15] call oh Jesus and I believe it
[56:19] will come on but he says I'll bless him
[56:23] I I he said I I'll rebuke him for your
[56:25] sake you know one thing they were saying
[56:27] here in the scriptures and the thing is
[56:29] a lot of times you don't say things from
[56:32] your mouth but your
[56:35] actions what your spirit is saying God
[56:37] hears it and that's what he's saying

[56:43] vain to Worship the Lord thy God they
[56:45] said when we say that God saw your
[56:48] actions come on they were saying at that

[57:08] worship God didn't they they begin to
[57:11] say within themselves look at the wicked
[57:13] and the proud and all those things come
[57:16] on but God said that he heard the
[57:18] righteous now come on he heard them that
[57:20] fear the lord talking to one another
