god lord god just lord god we don't know what to say but you know what is needed god and i pray god that you'll speak in jesus name amen [Music] as we stand for the reading of the word uh saint matthew 17 chapter and 10th verse saint matthew 17 and 10. we had so many out tonight that they had is getting to the end of the school year and so much activities going on so rachel had school activity and everybody's having school activities but thank god for you that made it tonight it says and his disciples uh 17 matthew 17 10. it takes you know we usually have to screen but and his disciples ask him saying why then said the strives that elijs must first come in the 11th verse it says and jesus answered and said unto them that truly elijah's truly shall what shall first come and what and restore all things but i say unto you that elijah is worth come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listened likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them may god bless you his word you may be seated we want to go back he says in 11th verse and we want to deal with the thought restoring all things restoring all things praise god has it ever been a time amen that all things needed to be restored i believe in this hour all things has been restored praise god we're not we're not talking about just things amen we're talking about a precipice uh god is uh talking about his specific and we want to show that you know in a moment but he said elijah's shall come and he said a loss has come already speaking to two issues the lies truly is going to come and restore all things shall come and restore all things and elijah has come elijah elijah has come and y'all didn't know him and you did to him whatever you listen so by the grace of god let's see the elijah that has come at this particular time and they had let's go to luke 1 and 17 luke 1 and 17. you know when god sends said elijah a lot of times when the bible says in amos 3 7 surely the lord god would do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servant the prophets are you with me so before god does any major thing god has a way of revealing what he's about to do before god brings judgment he always gives us a warning god don't bring judgment on a generation without a warning the bible said noah was a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood but they didn't listen to noah they rejected known message but god had a way of warning the people before he bought the judgment before god does because before god destroyed nineveh he sent jonah jonah came out of the fish valley and god warned them before he destroyed it but nineveh went they fasted and they prayed and they repented are you with me so they came to repentance and before god does any major thing he would always send a warning we're talking about what's going on in russia and ukraine and all that and we know we're approaching and the earth is quaking and and all these things are happening and th these things that are happening it's it's scripture so we know gog and magog talking about russia and talking about the battle of america and we're talking about two worlds that pass in the third world coming shortly we talk about world war world war one world war ii and the third world war would be it so we'll run at that are you open well because we had the uh babylon which was the head of gold you know what i'm saying and i i don't want to give you too much let's just let's just take our time i was thinking about start mike brook um tuesday for those that want to come a volunteer come a bible study you know i'm saying so by the grace of god and then we'll break things down a little farther but luke 1 and 17. and as we had our finger on matthew there and i'll read matthew again and i'll see when i get to rushing and speeding up and then i i i might be going too fast for somebody and my hopefully uh i don't i don't want to do that so i'll slow down and let's go back let's hold our hands on luke and matthew okay matthew he says uh in 11th verse 17-11 and jesus answered said unto them elijah truly shall what first come right and what oh restore all things now hold that and go over to luke 117. and he and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of elijah elias to turn the hearts of the world the hearts of the fathers to the word children okay and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord are you with me so now in order to understand that we go to madaka four let's see we're going through a lot of scriptures but hopefully you you can keep up with us okay in monaco it says at four and five behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the what now in the great and drafted day in revelation 11 these two prophets come moses and elijah but before the great that's the tribulation period and before the great and dreadful day we know the world is going to go through the mark of the beast the great tribulation period the antichrist time all of that is coming but before that time come he said i would send you behold i was sending to you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day it's going to be a terrible day it's a day of trouble a time of trouble that we've never seen since there was a world are you with me so that's why the time the ukraine is they're feeling it and i said brother sister we don't want to feel it in america but it's got to come they're going through their troubled times and we're praying for them but you said it it won't happen to a miracle why not it won't happen to the world it's going to reel and roll like a drunk man because of sin god said it in the days of noah as it was in the days of noah he said in luke 17 as it was in the days of noah and as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed i said we we're at this hour it's an hour that we should become desperate to get closer to god but instead of getting closer to god look like people are getting farther farther away from god we want god to help us but we don't want to repent of our sins men don't want to stop doing evil they don't want to turn and and repent and say god forgive us i'm sorry will the nation do that will america do that we're trying to get the abortion issue right we're trying to get this you know all of that but i i i'm just saying it all the king horses and all the king men couldn't put hump deductions together again that's old y'all might not even know that that's when we was in in elementary school but it's something about trying to put things back together after we go so far it's hard to try to put the pieces back together are you with me so men in order to repent and resp get it restored back so the church has gone through an awful condition went through the dark ages of history when the catholic church killed 68 million are you with me and that was the dark ages of history but god promised that i will restore said the lord all the years that the cankerworm palmer won the locals the caterpillar ever eaten i will restore said the lord god promised to restore his church though it went through a dark time are you with me but god promised i will restore said the lord the lord to restore his people back to how it was and the original church they meant to the original word back to pentecost back to the power of the holy ghost back to signs and wonders back to miracles they went back to where the people wanted to be christians to love the lord thy god with all our heart are you with me when you're in love with god amen and love his word so he says and the sixth verse chromatical four he said and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the what children and the hearts of the disobedient in the hearts of the children to their fathers excuse me and and he should turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that was john the baptist ministry are you with me and the hearts of the children to their fathers now john the baptist came to get those orthodox jews hearts turned that they can receive jesus christ are you with me but at the end the time of restitution at the end time it's elijah was to come to turn the children back into what the fathers had established he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it praise god it's all the mix-up and all the chaos and confusion with the what is it christian who is the christians and all that and people got all types of bibles all types of denomination all types of creeds and dogmas of men but god wants us to be turned back to the word god in simplicity not theology but back to the word amen theology would never reveal the word god said when the holy ghost come he'll teach you all things amen without the holy ghost the teacher is not there you'll never be able to understand the things of god except you have the spirit of god and they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god all you have been so we need the spirit amen without the spirit we want to understand it the bible is a sealed book amen hallelujah so you want amen theology will never teach it to you it takes the holy ghost to reveal jesus christ jesus said uh when nicodemus said rabbi we know that thou teacher that come from god because no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him and jesus said verily verily i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see in other words he cannot understand the kingdom of god how can he see the kingdom of god amen if he's not born again amen said can a man in a second time into his mother's mood and be born you know it's too late but he said except for a man is born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god are you with me so it takes a born-again experience are you with me not just believing amen we can believe but we got to keep on believing amen praise god we just can't stop till i accept jesus as my personal savior and i stopped there you got to keep on praise god you got to keep going justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost justified then sanctified cleaned up and then filled with the spirit amen now that's three stages to the birth the water breaks then the blood the baby then the life are you a man so you must be born again what a blood and spirit okay are y'all with me uh god is good amen i'm running for my life but lord will let's go back to there must be an absolute there must be if god don't judge judge this earth and it's god's going to judge the world he's got to judge him by something and will he judge him by this church that church this preacher that preacher or what he's going to judge us about i said one day amen the book will be open as i said uh we got to you know get our direction we got to have our road map amen and we got to have something the book the judge has law books and he's going to judge you by what's in the law books are you with me but this is the book that god's going to judge every man by he's going to open the word and says did you you know here's the book are you with me did you keep my word you said well i didn't understand it now who's responsible for that amen god said faith come by hearing and hearing come by the word of god and how can he preach except you'd be sin amen and god sent a preacher he's going to preach god's word are you with me he can't preach what the church said that's what was wrong folks were saying what the church said they were saying what what they learned in school and all that but what about the bible don't let nothing have preeminence over the word of god the word must be your absolute amen so uh back to luke 1 here and he says in the malachi 4 it was two things that turned the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the children to the fathers in luke 1 17 john the baptist ministry was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children you remember and the disobedient to the wisdom of the jest to make ready a people prepared for the lord john came to prepare he said i'm the voice and this oh that's john who are you are you elasticity i'm not they say who are you you know john said i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness preparing the way of the lord are you with me jesus said if you can receive it john was the last are you whooping so by the grace of god it seemed to be somewhat confusing because john knew that the people at that time thought that he was the elijah to restore all things so john told them i'm not elijah but john right here zechariah is beginning to prophesy and tell you that john was elijah jesus said john was the light but john said i'm not because he knew you remember the jesus own disciples said after he rose from the dead they asked jesus in acts 1 master will at this time restore the kingdom to israel see what i'm saying are you understanding me they thought that we had come to the kingdom age and god was getting ready amen because they were under roman rule god was gonna give amen what ezekiel saw concerning the dry bones and the bones living again and jerusalem being turned back to the jews the jews still looking for that praise god will you restore all things is this the kingdom age praise god it was not the kingdom age yet are you coming that son of david or son of man amen they didn't understand that lord have mercy i'm saying this is the hour that we're saying some strange things if you it's new to your ears but by the grace of god i want you to understand god you're going to judge if you don't understand not enough he's going to judge every man by this word and god in this last they promised to restore the word the bible you say well everybody got the bible but he said i would that you all speak the what same same thing that there be no division among you are you with me so what happened it was it was a very it was needful that in that day that they speak the same thing they're not supposed to be somebody preaching this over here and somebody preaching that over there we're all going to the same heaven and all of that how can it be that god will be jesus said what i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me isn't that right so jesus is the way the bible said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and he said in the word was me flesh are you what man and that was jesus he was the word that was in the beginning he said before abraham was i am aren't you glad that amen praise god that we got the word amen praise god don't i mean the pre the preacher is all right the church is all right but i want the word i thank god for the preacher thank god for the church but oh hallelujah your anchor holds in this word amen jesus said except a man abide in me my word abiding amen you got to abide in him praise god god is good now you know ii thessalonians and i'm gonna be real short now so you got questions comments i don't see glad to get with you but i'm it's just uh somewhat of a a prelude or some lesson that we probably have soon coming soon on second thursdaylonians two it says not because your brethren by the coming of the lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in what all be troubled neither by the spirit nor by word law by letter as from us as the day of christ is i believe it's closer now that's 2 000 years over 2000 years ago but i believe that the coming of the lord is at hand if god get us out of here before the great tribulation before the mark of the beast before the antichrist and get us out of here in the rapture before the the world is the nuclear bombs are letting loose god get us out of here don't you want to go you don't want to be left around here with all that chaos isn't that right you want to be gone how are you going to go the bible said and we shall be changing the moment of what twinkin of an eye amen that's going to be a rapture we're going to be changed amen we're looking for jesus to come the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out amen the lord coming back with a shout with the voice of an archangel god coming back for his people the ones that love him the one to give their life to him the one that said god i love you jesus amen if you love jesus you love his word and jesus is coming back for his children praise god but will we be ready to meet him and that's what it's all about god i mean it's it's not a mystified something it's something that's real jesus is real he loves us and he's coming back for those that love him are you with me he won't leave nobody behind he's not going to forget you because he knows each and every one the bible says nevertheless the foundation of god has to stand ashore having this seal the lord knows them that he is are you with me and don't you think god don't know you god know your thoughts god know what you're thinking the god know what you've been through god knows what you're going through and god said amen he cares about you praise god don't you know that god won't make no mistake amen god won't leave you behind if you want to go with him if your desire is to be raptured out of here before they make the bonds fall then god knows your desire so god will make a way for you and you say god i don't want to be left behind and you mean that with all your heart then god will make a way he provided a way for you but you know you got others that don't they don't come to that place in their life they don't never come to those moments those tender moments but you are concerned about you know this world and the status of the world and what you know just what what where am i what as an individual my life lord i don't want to be here when all of this is going on i want to be caught up to meet you i want to be in the rapture lord i want you i love you lord don't leave me in this oh you know you can't understand what's going on now all this trouble and viruses and all kinds of things just think how would be the bible said only he did not let really let till he be taken out of the way what happens when the holy ghost is lifted off the earth and it's just chaotic praise god you think you can walk the streets you think oh god it's going to be terrible schoolhouses everywhere you turn people are just you know mass shootings killings all of that what kind of world would we live in if jesus don't hurt her up and come what you don't want him to hurry up and come and you're not ready to go you say take your time lord wait a minute i got to get some things right don't hurry but wait wait you see i believe god is waiting just for the opportunity because he knows amen that you're not ready so he's waiting on that last one amen that he saw before the foundation of the world god for knew you he predestinated you to the adoption of sons are you what man so god knew that you would come to it when you hear amen because it might be an uncertain sound to somebody but it's a certain sound you know amen the bible said my sheep know my voice and the stranger they will not follow they know when they hear amen god's voice you know it's not the preacher on the pulpit it's the voice of the lord when he speaks down in you that's the voice you listen to the preacher on the pulpit if you follow the man you get you in a lot of trouble but that voice once you learn the voice of god that god can still speak amen it might be you know it speaks to you and you hear that little tender voice of god speaking to your heart you hear something down in the inside and that desire it's always leading you to the truth always leading you to do the right thing to live the right kind of life and to love the lord amen to love his word that voice you listen to that voice amen praise god you'll never be led wrong if you listen to him amen it's a lot of people they meant if it was possible he had to show in the days of no flesh would be saved uh he said if it was possible he deceived even the very late amen but god had to shout in the days for the election are you with me oh god i said hey this brother's from romania i said am i going too fast they said no no you can go but here we are uh second thessalonians third um the third verse he says let no man deceive you by any means that's what i'm saying you got to check to preach out don't just fall in love with people that you think are more intelligent to you no more than you and um they've been trained better than you you know sometimes you have to get a second opinion on the doctor sometimes you have to get a third and fourth opinion are you with me you just can't just oh he said you need operation you need this and you say well uh thank you doctor when you want to do it you know whatever is it sometimes you just better check it out and say well uh you know especially if it's a serious operation you might want to get a second opinion are you with me all right and then you want to know the credentials is this the best that i can get because when it's a matter of life and death i want the best that i can get even if i have to travel i want the best are you with me if it's concerned in my life then i want the best i don't don't give me somebody just fresh out of college and or whatever never done it before you know experiment on me some intern some you know give me somebody got some experience are you with me so don't trust your soul just because oh oh oh yeah but trust the voice of god because that's the voice that inner voice that will lead you and guide you praise god and you know it's not to preach it it's not it's it's the voice of god speaking on the inside of you leading you in the right path because it's the same voice when you're the child until you don't do that who is that you know it was him checking you some folks don't seem like they got that they don't they're not never checked they just do anything and look like they no nothing inside of them no conscience at all just do anything but you you're special you know you can't do it i said come on let's do it i don't know like that even though you got by god allowed you to get but it was always something there to check you are you with me are you wondering is it not with them they don't nothing to tell y'all that's wrong you know what i'm saying but something telling you this is wrong this is wrong don't do that you know what i'm saying even so you look back and you say what was that now when you're getting a little older in there you realize he was there all the time god was there all the time it just it just came a time that you recognized it was him all the time are you with me i don't know why i'm saying those things but god knows it says let no man deceive you by any means that's what i'm saying i know some people now and some i didn't hear troubled because it's very intense i don't want to be deceived i don't want to be deceived he said let no man deceive you the bible said the word of god is quick powerful shoveling into his sword it can discern the thoughts and the tense of the heart don't you know when god's speaking he knows exactly where you are he knows exactly what you're thinking what you're going through and he knows exactly how to let you know whether it's him or not you know somebody said nobody knew that but i didn't even speak it out loud i just thought it there was just something going on with me but god knew it isn't that right and god knew it was a time in the season that he's gonna you know don't be afraid you all said fear not it is i isn't that right you don't have to fear god when god is speaking okay he says let no man deceive you for that day shall not come except there become a what a falling away first and that man of sin be what reveal i'm gonna tell you something it's not a falling away from the church because i'm going to tell you people are going to church and it's a falling away from the word the people are falling away from the word of god church is more about entertainment you know who's got the best entertainment and young people are falling for entertainment not for the word i said i remember when we were excited these young people in college most of the college campus was going through revival and you know i'm talking about 40 something years ago everybody excited excited and it was scripturally they were excited about what the bible was saying and i said where's that excitement where we were sharing look what god said here look what god said there and everybody excited with the scripture just on fire with scripture you know what you got today i got this one this is what the lord said this is you know excitement young people you know just learning how you know to apply the word precept upon precept lying upon the line here a little they're a little i'm talking where's our excitement have you fallen in love with god because the bible says the word is god when you fall in love with the word means something god opened that up to you it speaks to you through the word and the word speaks back to you he said thank you lord thank you for loving me thank you for speaking to me thank you for talking to me you know and that's what it's all about you learn that relationship you have with god you're learning to

truth amen back to god [Music] it says in galatians 1 6 it says i marvel that you're so soon removed there'll be a great fall in the way he said our marble that you're so soon removed from him that'll call you unto the grace of christ into another gospel which is not another but there will be some that what that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we on angel from heaven preach any of the gospel then that which we preach unto you let him be a curse as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any of the gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be your what curse that's not another gospel it's the same bible the same word of god that's what restoring back to the bible where you can look in this book and find life you can find god because he's
