said none of the wicked shall i understand but the wise shall understand father help us this morning today help us tonight lord to say things that will open our understanding will cause us to draw closer to you father we need you now bless your people now bless your word in jesus name amen habakkuk 2 habakkuk 2 and 1. familiar scripture says i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and i will watch to see what he was saying unto me and what i shall answer when i'm reproved and he's and the lord answered me and said write the what make it what make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not what though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come and it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the jaws shall live by faith god bless you you may be seated god bless the word tonight make it plain make it plain and we thought about something the prophet god was bringing out god hidden in simplicity and revealing himself in the same god hides himself in simplicity and i was just praying and so many things came and so much until i just try to be simple tonight and try to convey unto you the thought i said if i were a teacher i could teach about four or five hours and i can see where teachers go but hopefully we just tried to give you a hit a little here and a little there and trust that god would give you he said we're not getting all i get and get understanding amen so by the grace of god in that verse it says the second verse it says the lord answered me and said write the vision make it he said write the vision and make it what make it plain god don't want it to be complicated he wants it to be simple and plain instead in isaiah i think it's 35 it says shall be a way there on the highway it should be called the way of holiness said the fool should not air so god wants it to be plain maybe i got a little too much feedback make it plain so um i tried to take you where i was because i i believe that i thank god for the teachers but sometimes the teachers look like they they make it almost like they're telling you something that come on you're getting too much just just toned it down um it's they tell you so much they make it so complicated until you it looks like they're telling you something way out there instead of simplifying the word and that's why you come with certain sex you got this particular persuasion people believe in this and people believing that and then you got all these many denominations because somebody come up or with a thought and they somewhat they just dwell on that particular thought and they think they got something that nobody else have and when they go that way it causes individuals to be exalted men to exalt themselves as as though they have some private interpretation of the word and uh i find that it's easily it's easy to be lifted up by men but the gospel should be well jesus is the one being lifted up and not the man it's you don't want to see the man you want to see jesus and the emphasis should be put on jesus christ but sometimes you get caught up with the the charisma or the way a person can teach or preach and we get so caught up in that and it's good sometimes you tell the preacher you appreciate that message but let's not did we get the point that is he pointing us to jesus christ and does when we here does it change our lives because if all we're doing is hearing and not doing then it's not effective it doesn't matter how well how good the teacher is or the preachers if it's not changing our lives then you know it's something about oh my preacher just my preacher that and then look at a person's life if i was a preacher that was interested in people living a life then i would want them my preaching you'll be ashamed of them then christians how do you think christ feels when persons say i'm a christian and living like the devil uh you know you you're what i i'm a christian cursing smoking drinking line stealing cheat but they say i'm a christian in other words i'm following christ so somebody says it's that okay brother and sister god that point make it plain um the book of matthew here make it plain matthew 11 and 25 he says at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee your father lord of heaven and earth because thou has what the hit these things from what yeah the wise and the smart people you hit it from them that's why sometimes when people are intelligent and they're smart sometimes we think oh man look how ooh ooh people follow the intelligent and smart and the brilliant and the genius and iqs the heavy you know what i think jesus christ that he when peter those told a man at the gate called beautiful look on us and it said seven gold having none but such as we have a given and the bible said they marveled at them because they were ignorant and what and and jesus said to peter i'm giving you the keys to the kingdom he could have gave him to paul [Music] he could have gave him to luke the physician but he gave him to peter a fisherman ignorant did not learn and see what happens that god hides himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same god does the little small things and 9 out of 10 as the prophet said 9 out of 10 we miss it when god is doing something we're always looking for god to do something and we all talk about what he has done and we fail to recognize what he's doing because we don't see what he's doing we're always looking for what he has done and what he's going to do but we don't have 9 out of 10 he said we fail to recognize what he's doing so here he says thou heared it from the wise and the prudent and revealed them unto babes sometimes we get too grown for god to reveal it his word to us so because we get heady high-minded and boastful and bragging but he reveals it to babes and sometimes we gotta become humble enough to become a baby because when we think we're something when we're nothing we think we we got it all we know it all and we you know i'm somebody and you know you know you know it's easy to get proud and think we something we mean nothing it's easy to get lifted up and it's easy you know sometimes we can get a degree sometimes we can get uh you know a position and then we we become a prestigious and we think we somebody and you know it's easy you know to look up to somebody you know oh this person is a lawyer this person is doctor this person is a professor this person is it's good to attain those things thank god that some people attain those things but the thing that ought to be the utmost thing that we look up is that person a christian [Music] is that person saved does that person have christ so it's very important that christ is the center thank god for those that you know achieve certain things but that's not our ultimate we need to put christ first in all things and everything christ is first but i i think we are so much caught up and hung up on things that does not glorify god so we are not witnessing any more about jesus no more because jesus is not the important thing we're telling the story about other things we're not about jesus we're not concerned about a soul being saved no more we're concerned about how much money in the bank how much education or how much does and that the bible said in the lukewarm age that we'll be rich increasing what and said i have needed see sometimes we look past because we're not going to be victims of the laodicea of the lukewarm spirit we're not going to be candidates we look at you know we look beyond not seeing what god is doing we look at what god's going to do and what god has done but we don't see what happening right now in our midst the lukewarm is people amen they're not concerned about coming to church and really seeking god's face and really being on fire for god they're more worried about the kind of things the under my job my my this my dad amen the pews would be full that the people really had their values in the right place if they really had god first you know no they you could they couldn't wait till they get in the house of god because they know the scripture says forsake not disassembly yourself together as the man or some is even the more every seeding in approaching and they're right but we don't care i mean we got that nonchalant spirit of we don't care one way another about see it's your soul that's that state it's your it's god that will serve and not the church not not not the pastor not the ministry but your servant god and god amen oh lord that's for sunday i got to stay away from that hopefully i'll get there sunday let me get back to you okay he says he reveals it to babe the 26th verse even so father so it seems what good in that sight and all things are delivered into me of my father and no man nor the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whomsoever the son will what now if christ has really been revealed to you christ has been revealed in his own word if christ has really been revealed to you then your action will actually amen be the interpretation of the word that's been revealed to you are you with me so you want to see the word interpreted amen he said a virgin shall concede and because mary the virgin conceived was the interpretation of that word so mary was the virgin are you with me so what happens if christ has been revealed to you and the word has been revealed to you then you become the manifestation of that word that promised for the hour you live in are you with me but what side of the word are you on the lukewarm side because we know that lay out a seal would be lukewarm but there will be some that i would that you were hot or what and cold because the lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth isn't that right he said i'll cancel you to buy me gold are you with me so i i i thank god because god has given you asap that you might be able to what see oh lord let me go on uh let's go back to corinthians here first corinthians 1. first corinthians 1 and i'll just start here uh make it plain make it plain paul was a very intelligent man but he said all i gained i can't lost i don't care how much education i've attained and i'm in how hard i tried to get my phd and my and my all of my education aiming all the knowledge and you know i always heard you know paul had so many languages that he spoke and all of that and he was a very intelligent man he was taught under the best teacher gomez he was able to stand up before kings and our origins he was able to go to the high priest and get letters connection saul of tasha's amen when you call that name it caused christians to tremor because they know amen when you say saul latashas amen analyze didn't even want to oh no god you know heard about that man but he coming to see you and i want you to pray for him are you with me because god hasn't got to hold the saul of tarshish amen i'm sending him back to the street called straight and you'll find ananias and you tell you what you got to do he ain't meant to pray for him that is he's blind now i want you to pray for him that he received his sight tell him what he must do and a nice song said rise and be baptized and wash away your sins amen prayed for him amen when god can humble you you know so many things happen in life to get people to the position that they need to be in to be what god has ordained for them to be and there's some humbling experiences that we must pass to sometimes to get where god wants us to be and god knows how to humble us down god knows how to turn us around and so uh things could happen to us that all our hard studious work and all that we've achieved and all that we have accomplished all of a sudden it becomes vanity all of a sudden it doesn't mean nothing it's just how many people that i've seen come to the end of their journey and have achieved money and houses and wealth and things of this life when i see them come down to the end of the journey i heard them all say the same thing none of this means nothing and as long as folks live they they're scratching and they doing it trying to get it only to come to the end of the road and realize it wasn't worth it brother and sister only what you do for christ will last that's why paul said at the end of his journey he said i fought a good fight i kept the faith i kept the faith i finished my course what about you brother sister amen god hides himself in simplicity reveals himself in the same i was just praying before everybody came in and just got out and just started seeking the lord it just i just got overwhelmed into the message and so much that i can't even explain it let me just go a little further it says in one and um 22 it says i just read 21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god the word by wisdom knew not god it pleased god that please god by the what the foolishness you all say how people laugh at you thank you foolish it's it's not meant to go in this way no more i'm gonna tell you brothers and sisters it's people go to church people preach people sing but most of them think you're foolish if you for real if you really for real they think i'm wrong with you because they don't think it takes they don't take all that they get to heaven you don't have to you don't have to live like that they think you they think you're not enjoying life because it's so much enjoyment out here for life it's so much fun don't you miss your your youth have some fun go out and enjoy yourself get your boyfriend get your girlfriend go to your prom go to your students do that live it up while you got a children got one time and you hate you missed it don't miss your prom don't miss your time to have your boyfriends because one day you might just be stuck with just one live it up why you got an opportunity you know make it plain god huh see we we we we hear the devil has a plan and god has a plan for you which plan do you want to follow god's plan or the devil's plan the devil don't care what you do god wants you amen to be holy are you with me but it takes a real soldier a real warrior that's time for god in this hour that we live in take somebody that really has gotten an understanding somebody that god has really revealed himself look at what he says it please god that by the fullness of preaching to save them that what come on now you know he said the foolishness of preaching just saved them that do you believe are you a believer well it's foolishness it's foolishness to the i'm talking about to the so-called christian this is foolishness oh it's foolishness that you would serve the lord and it's nothing wrong with drinking a little wine a little you know getting a little high you know ain't nothing wrong with that you don't seem like everything goes and anything goes and everybody going to heaven no matter what oh thank god you know all these different happenings are happening amen people can be cursing you out on their death bed and on their way to heaven [Music] that's all thank the lord we're having all kind of tragedies and things that are happening you know that's going on through the news and all but the first thing the folks say oh they made it to heaven lord hallelujah we'll see them again oh lord i don't want to say i hope they do but i just you know sometimes you know your actions speak louder than your what as the tree fall that's the way it's going what lay oh are you with me so so so don't don't you thank all these people because every time something happened to somebody no matter how big a devil they were uh uh oh they going on the heaven all these great preachers come up and articulate and they can tell that oh they're going to heaven come on [Music] man curse like a sailor but everybody protecting him are you a man i mean thank god god is merciful but you know what i'm saying it's better just to be quiet and pray for the man lord help the poor fellow he needs your help then to come out and try to protect just pray god heaven because all have sinned and come short of the glory of god but praise god help him right but oh no [Music] just keep quiet i'd rather keep quiet and just pray god happy lord he needs you lord just help him lord i mean amen somebody that's moderately used to be a blessing to god's people but yet they got so much going on in the life god help them are you with me god help him because it could have been me are you with me see sometimes we can't help ourselves and other folk that can't help us instead of helping us they they're lifting us up like we're all right and we know we ain't all right that's what happened in church i'm trying to help somebody to get all right somebody patting them on the back oh you all right i said lord have mercy you see what i'm saying they're making me look like the devil and and the person need help and you patting them on the bed oh they're all right no they ain't all right they need help and i'm trying to help him well he shouldn't have done this he should have said come on somebody you know i never can't forget uh when jared was a little boy and um he had done something he was he was being bad and i said i see first flight you getting ready to give him a licking i said don't don't do that like that he looked at me he looked at me and he smiled he said you should say he said he ain't got no children and that was right i i that and and i look but i always look back at that sometimes these children can they need a little touch-up don't they they need something and i they need some correction that's what i just say are you of me so by the grace of god and sometimes you don't understand when correction time come you know oftentimes i tell a story when the police got somebody jacked up in their pants don't know the man just rapes the young lady what did what he got the man jack up like that he doesn't beat somebody half the death then raped somebody and the police got him jacked up handcuffed and somebody on silence what he got him got to do him like that oh lord see what i'm saying it's something about us sometimes we come to the rescue without understanding sometimes we open our mouths when we should keep them closed sometimes our thoughts are not his thoughts and sometimes our ways are not his ways sometimes what you thinking is not what god's thinking are you with me praise god i found out that every child is different and every parent parents have to deal with their children according to wisdom and you i can't tell you this is what i did for my child this is what you got to do for yours you got to seek god and ask god what to do are you with me now god can help me sometime to give you a little encouragement but the ultimate thing is you're going to be responsible for pastoring your own house are you with me i have to give account for what i say and you're going to have to give a count for how you really raise a real your children and your family you're going to have to give account to god for that the church ain't gonna do it for you are you with me and it's gonna take a lot of prayer sometimes you have to cry sometimes you have to fast sometimes you have to just don't know what to do you have to wait on god okay he said 22nd verse for the jews require a sign the greeks seek out the wisdom you see what i'm saying people get caught up with signs and some people get caught up with wisdom you know some folk so that that's back then the jews the require signs some people want to see signs the greeks seek out the wisdom some people look for wisdom you see them and that's what it's about come on you can see the jews right here right now jews require a sign and the greek wisdom are you a jew or greek because you can see what you what what you require it's one of those categories you might find yourself in but let me show you what you should be he said but we preach christ what crucified unto the jews or what are you with me come on some people seeking out the signs sign seekers to the jews christ crucified isis man that's all you got to preach christ crucified that's all you got to preach is the cross it's assembly block man if we can get people to the cross if people would only come to the cross and see christ crucified and what he done for them oh boy what what kind of church we have are you a man a church on fire because they realize that he oh lord i got to wait till sunday i get the jumping matter you might be changed before this lady i better go and start sharing because my son i'll be on something else all together different you don't know what tomorrow gonna bring isn't that right brother friends okay a stumbling block until the greek is what foolishness you know paul was facing you know these type of audience these type of spirits in these type of characteristics and he realized that amen what the people were seeking and what was the condition of the church at that time and the people amen and i believe but unto them which are called both jew and greek christ the what power of god and are you with me brother and sister you've got to come to reality where christ is the power of god and the wisdom of god when you walk in an authority with power and god's humility and humbleness and the power of god in the wisdom of god i'll tell you something to walk that kind of walk you'll be despised and rejected of men yes you will cry see what i'm talking about you as an individual i'm talking about myself i'm talking about all of us as individuals we got to search ourselves because that's what we ought to not seeking after this and that but let's our own identification amen our identity because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is what [Music] let's not look for men and personalities and this that persuading this persuasion one time we had so many superstars and you know superstars seem to be falling stars are you with me and then somebody else rise up and become a superstar and then their afterthought [Music] their records have been crushed [Music] they once was the greatest not somebody else is greater are you with me they once was a man but somebody else become you know we have mighty preachers we come to take the world by storm and then all of a sudden they become nothing it's another one come by and then people have followed you know what i'm saying but how what about they met the bride she has her own personal identification you must know god for yourself are you with me you personally have that confidence in god that god can do for you amen what he did in christ he's dozing in your life great is he that are you with me that same jesus living his life through you brother and sister now for you you see what you see what you see your calling are you with me you see your calling brethren how that not many what after the flesh and not many what i'm gonna tell you so it's in the people to look for a saw somebody head and shoulder above everybody else and everybody rallied around that head and shoulder oh oh oh we're wowed by that but is that what the holy spirit drawn this to that's why god was able to use somebody with a seventh grade education [Music] god hiding himself in simplicity somebody that didn't have all the proper english and all of that stuff god does the same thing today he hides himself in simplicity and we always miss him because we're so busy you know that's why those other fellows just look like they surpass the prophet they become world renowned and they still talk about you know you know to the intellectual world they build colleges and schools and great seminaries and hospitals and all of that you see what i'm saying but god in a simple people revealing jesus christ again in bright form that people step out of nowhere those people that are nobodies and just simple plain people but it's the plain truth that they have the plain truth amen make it plain the plain truth simple truth it says not many mighty not many noble great men are called not many noble call y'all see why i'm taking it slow i'm not a teacher but i'm trying to do my best because it'll take a long time to really emphasize every point not many noble not many kings and presidents and males of the city and senators and representatives and people that we will look up to kings and queens and prime ministers not many of those are called not many noble men this is you know the esteemed sewing showing this and dr revan so and so on not many of those are called god sometimes he looks at little simple somebody that no folks don't don't even recognize what god recognized you brothers and sisters don't try to get known by the world he said nevertheless the foundation of god standeth the sure having to seal the lord knows them that uh his and so he said let everyone to name the name of christ let him depart from what iniquity amen god knows because you have the seal the seal of god in your forehead brother fred is because of the seal having this sealed the lord knows them that he is amen so i gotta i gotta stop somewhere but god is good there's so much here to share i wanted to go to daniel and isaiah and all over the place but time gonna fail me i wanted to read the next chapter but time will fail me but the lord knows them out of his and i want to say to you make it plain paul here says in the second chapter he says and our brother when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimonies of god for i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling for and my speech and my preaching was not with what enticing words somebody you know it's almost it's almost that in order to be a good teacher we must say what it means in greek and what it means in hebrew and we got to make up break all that terminology down and make you think that we somebody smart and intelligent make you go away impressed that you know [Music] are you with me and it's all right if that's that what god the ability that god gave that person that's fine but sometimes i think we're more caught up in the personality than we're in with jesus i believe we need to get jesus jesus i said make it plain let it be simple let it be with grandmama that can't read the right understand what you're saying and that it it's effective way it's breaking yokes and demons are being cast out people lives are changed the power of god is working hallelujah hallelujah but our gospel we hear it is here to them that are lost whom the god of this world has blinded the mind i'll tell you the devil is blind in folk's mind praise god here we are he says not with enticing words of man's wisdom praise god we're not competing see who's the most
