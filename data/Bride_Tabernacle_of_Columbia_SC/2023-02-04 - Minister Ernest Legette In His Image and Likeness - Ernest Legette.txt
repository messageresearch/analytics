that you might anointed oh God that it might be food for your children oh God to give them oh God a word and this dying hour Lord The Darkest Hour ever known the world history but nevertheless Lord you said God Arise when I light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon me Lord I pray God that you might bless us here today I pray Lord if we said or done anything that's not like you the Lord you forgive us and help us to be reconciled to you God give us the grace that we need Lord to minister your word God oh God benefit your kingdom Lord we thank you bless the sick and Afflicted Lord touch their bodies Lord those that desire to be here tonight but couldn't make it I just pray about God by the holy spirit that you might go by and see about him Lord for we thank you Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God is good amen we want to look at the Book of Genesis by God's grace Genesis 1 and we'll begin at the 24th verse God is good amen Genesis 1 and 24. we got to say Amen and it reads and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the beasts of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female he created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the father of the air and over to every living thing that moveth upon the Earth may God have bless the reading of his words you may be seated tonight by the grace of God just for a moment I just want to minister on a little something don't tend to be long tonight just on a little something that I've been ministering on the last couple of weeks and and I entitled it in His image and likeness Amen in His image and likeness so we see here you know in the setting of The Scriptures you know we know about the whole creation and how God you know spoke things into existence and you know everything we see is a product of the spoken word of God and you know just how powerful it was God's voice in creating all these things but you know and and when God created everything you know the Bible said and he saw it and it was good so God created everything everything God created was good it was nothing bad about it so you know we find that you know in the creation you know and God created this place you know sometimes we think about that place and you know they're in Eden and how you know we can see Perfection sometimes like we said at its best we see a place of no violence no sickness no pain no tiredness no worriation or none of these things indeed and it was a perfect place because that was a place that God had created and it was good wasn't it so we saw that you know and I says that you know we find today that you know he says what happened to to that place because sometimes when you talk about that place it's just some place of Mythology in in uh the human mind today because they can't even conceive that there is is even a place of perfection like that but God created a place and he created you and I to be in that place but through the fall that's why we see it when we look at today what's going on we look at the world in a fallen state we look at the condition of the people what it is they're in a fallen State you know I believe the Bible says that whole earth was grown and in travail waiting on the manifestations of the sons of God why is the earth grown and because it knows that there is a place of perfection it knows that there is a place where there's no death where there's no violence and all these things where there's they know that everything is out of cater come on so it's waiting on you and I it's grown and you know in travail until now waiting on you and I because it desires itself to get back to that place y'all believe that tonight so we see that that you know everything is everything is out of care because of the Fall everything is out of catered thrown all out away right you see that you say it's so bad out of cater that that that now we look at it in his entirety that the wrong is right and the riot is wrong and we look at that's just the state of man today because while he's at his Fallen State we look at it that you know we talk about it many of times that you know they're they're in a reprobate state in the mind frame to where they know that these things are wrong but you know one thing about even in being in that reprobate state that I always look at that the Bible says that when they knew God they glorified him not come on they'd rather worship the creature the Creator the creature more than the Creator the Bible talked about you know it ain't that they that they never knew they didn't know no better but when they knew God they didn't want him they they became vain in their own imaginations they wanted the things that were evil and they kicked up against God they they this you know you know uh kicked them out or they didn't want them in their imaginations they didn't want to retain God in their knowledge so in all these things what did God do he turned them over to that reprobate State you didn't want God so now I'ma turn you over to that thing you know that those things you're doing are bad those things you deserve that people are dying that I destroyed people for them right but you want to do them anyway so since you desire and that's what's in your heart I'm gonna give it to you and I'm gonna let you have pleasure in while you're doing them and in the end I'm gonna judge you by it ain't that what God said come on so I says that you know what it is that's because that's what was in their heart the whole time wasn't it you know that's why we asked God all the time lord search my heart and try my range don't you know God knows everything that's in your heart I was sharing with somebody the other day I said no matter what you do you might can put on a good show in front of man put on a good uh outfit and and disguise and nobody know who you are right but there's one thing about it God knows exactly who you are he notices that he knows exactly where you're sitting at amen everything is naked and laid out before ain't nothing here before God and that's where we in ourselves in our minds sometimes make the biggest mistake is we think that we're getting away from man we hiding but guess what God looking at it the whole time come on and God is a righteous God he's a just God too the only only reason why you know he tolerate us sometime because it's still Blood On The Mercy Seat but you know the only difference between the mercy and the Judgment seat is the blood once that blood is taken away that same Mercy Seat that same place that same Throne where you could have came to and got Mercy you come before nine it's going to be judgment right come on but I don't know about you but I want the mercy of God every morning I wake up I say God I need your mercy God I need your grace I was praying in the car the other day I said Lord I Thank you for being rich in Mercy thank you for being rich in Grace you know I could have been cut off and gone long time ago but Lord I Thank You for Your Mercy help me to stand your way Lord come on search my heart let my heart be on the things of God lord I want you and I want more of you because without you I perish come on do you feel that way tonight I said the mother the darker this world get that's the more I feel that God without you I'm gonna perish God I was praying today I said Lord I need I need I I need your patience God give me your patience and God give me your wisdom I need patience and I need wisdom I said because trials are coming but you know what those things they're doing they're working out something minion they working out something in you I don't want to jump the gun but God I want patience and I want wisdom how to handle every situation that come before me I'm not looking far and far ahead no more God but I'm looking one day at a time God how I'm gonna make it through this day it ain't how I'm gonna make it through this day God I know I'll get through it no matter what comes my way my life is in your hands Lord help me to walk One Day at a Time come on like that sister you're saying that that song I believe a sister owes them one day at a time dear Jesus that's all I'm asking of you come on one day at a time that's all I'm asking of you looking at all these things tomorrow ain't even promised is it come on like that song say I give my life tomorrow come on but tomorrow ain't promised things turn quickly don't they situations turn bad real quick Hallelujah but it's one thing about it when you know you've done the best you can do and you're in the Master's hands you ain't worried about situations turning and changing because you know that no matter what come your way come on many are they that rise up against you and say that of your soul there ain't no help for you Hallelujah but it's something about you you say that oh Lord You're sure for me you're my glory and the lifter of my head devil saying all these things wolfing doing all these things shooting all kind of fiery darts at you come on but God give us weapons to fight with and that's what I'm putting on the whole armor of God you shouldn't Miss not one piece don't you know that little piece that you leave off that's the Gateway for the devil to get in don't miss not one piece but put on a whole armor come on use all the weapons that God gave you to fight with Hallelujah oh Jesus come on y'all believe that tonight come on but I says that you know in His image and likeness you know God made you and I to be in His image in his likeness he didn't made you to be in that Fallen state come on but the reason why men got men got in that Fallen state is because of what because of sin right come on sin you know in that like we talked about that perfect place and even in that perfect place when you think about that perfect place don't you know that the devil infiltrated and got in that perfect place even in that place the devil found a way to get into that perfect place into that place but even though he found a way you know through the serpent to enter into that place he still couldn't do nothing to Adam and Eve even in that place because as long as they stay with what the word of God said as long as they stay with God even though he might have infiltrated in that place all he can do is talk all he can do is Bluff but they were fortified behind that word nothing that he could throw at him nothing no physical nothing that he can do to him long as they kept that word but what it is he tricked them he tricked Eve you know that she was to see the Bible says the woman was in transgression not the man come on but the thing is he's deceived her to do what come from behind that word right talk to her into believing that oh God was hiding something from them he had something better he didn't give him his best ain't that what he told her come on just in a paraphrase way God ain't give you his best he hiding something from you come on he know that if you you do this then you you'll know more come on you you'll be more but then the Bible says she saw that the tree was the desire was good her eyes deceived or didn't he but God gave them a commandment not only you can't eat of it but don't touch it it's a dangerous thing to even touch it come on because the day you do that's the day you're gonna die but the devil had a way of of of deceiving of captivating her mind you know the prophet of God talked about greatest mistake uh uh she made was when she stopped to even listened to him because he walked right into her mind now I got her all confused the lusting at the things come on ain't that what it is the lust at the things thinking that that that oh yeah he's just trying to he just trying to hold you back for something you know I was I was look ministering not ministering but meditating on that and I was thinking I said you know that's what the devil does mostly to our young people right not just only to them but to the old people too but to the young he'll get them to think oh you know they you've been held back from something you know the devil got something God no he didn't know you're gonna have a good time no you're gonna have fun they don't want you they had they fun now you can go have yours come on but what it is I thought about that I said yes God was holding them back from something from all the pain that they was gonna have to go through he was holding them back from that from all the hardships from those Lonely Nights come on from the Heartbreak in the sorrow God was holding them back from it he was Sheltering them from that what come on he was but they thought that God was holding some back from him but what it is it was a world yes the devil talked to her about another world beyond that world that she was living in talk to her about another world it's a world Beyond this world and it was but in that world it was ruled by different laws in that world in that world it was an eye for an eye come on in that world you couldn't come to that lion and pet that lion no more he eat you up now in that world you didn't have dominion anymore Hallelujah in that world sickness applied in that world Hallelujah despair everything else applied to you in that world but if you would have stayed with God stay with his word you were governed by different laws you were governed by laws where he said I'm the Lord thy God that healeth thee come on you were governed by laws Hallelujah where sickness didn't affect you where you live by one law and that was faith that all things were possible to you in that place hallelujah oh Jesus come on buddy talked to them about another world didn't he and they were now after you know they uh committed the ACT you know they were about to experience all that right now you know they experience it but what it is I thank God that even that in that place when they did that you know God still had a plan to get them back from that Fallen State didn't it come on he had a plan to resurrect them from that place you know and it was going to be through what through his shed blood through the grace of God Amen amen that you and I wasn't even worthy of it come on but the way we came out was wrong but God had a way to get us back to that perfect place and that's what our hearts are longing for that's what all our our president is for all our fighting all our all our digging in prayer is for to do what because something inside of you is saying God didn't create me to be this way come on something inside you is telling you it's Perfection out there it's a place that you press into Hallelujah that's that's been seen to be the mythical to the rest of the world in the science room but to you and I that place ain't mythical but that place is real it's more realer than where we're living at now hallelujah it's all we long for because every day in this body we dying Hallelujah getting weaker ain't you come on every time you turn around bad news heartache and pain but something beside you is longing for that place of perfection God get me out of this state I'm in Hallelujah lift me up into that place to where you are don't you know God want to lift you up tonight Hallelujah [Music] but the devil want to do what keep you in that that mind frame there keep you in that state where you are come on but God is calling you to come on up I want you to come on up to this place hallelujah amen amen the world is dark Holly my my glory is lifting off the Earth come on let me catch you up to this place to where I am but the problem is today it's hard for us to let go of these carnal things hard for us to let go of those things that we so much lusting after come on those things that you keep holding on to them one day they gonna drag you down to the pits hell sometimes you say don't you say that but it's the truth anyhow ain't it come on those things that we hold on too long to dear I was telling somebody the other day I said what you love come on it'll show itself sooner or later you say you love God it'll show up sooner or later oh Jesus y'all believe that tonight let's look at James one glory to God God is good amen In His Image and likeness come on God created you and that's what it is you know I believe it even though God know all things I believe it hurt God the seed him in that Fallen state come on and I believe it it hurts God to see his children in a fallen state come on in a state you know I'll jump all over myself I was thinking about so many characters I thought about Samson and him being in his Fallen state come on God created him for one thing didn't he to be a a deliverer a judge and deliver for the people of Israel right gave him a gift that he was to use come on to be a blessing to the people of God as long as he kept what God Said and kept in a way then no matter what came about the anointing was on Samson Hallelujah and Samson could go out and run thousands couldn't he man he's cornered one time enemies all around him but when he woke up in the presence of God came home no matter who was out there or how they had a corner he picked the whole gates up didn't he out of the ground and carrying them up the hill and sat on he had something about him that that it was a gift that God gave him come on but what it is and and the enemy couldn't do nothing with that gift but what they had to do they had to get in there and get them to get off them to get out of the way of the word get out of the way of what God asked him they had to do something to get him out of that way didn't he but when they when he got out of that way he became just like any other man now Samson Mighty didn't know nothing about that world or what it was like to be weak but when he disobeyed God he was going to find out it was another world out there that what you operated in in the first realm it don't work in that Realm come on because now you came from behind the thing that was covering you you came from behind the thing that was Sheltering you the thing that protected you you're from behind that now so now you open game to the enemy he didn't know that come on you know I like the little illustration of prophet God's talking about and how he said the thing that hurts Samson wasn't memories come on he didn't have eyes anymore but in his mind he can go back in his memory Hallelujah and remember how God used to use him remember how you can reach back and feel those locks as long as he had those locks he knew that the enemy couldn't do nothing to him presence of God was on them because God made a covenant with him Hallelujah and he was fortified behind that but what it is you know the devil same way he did Eve came on come on he's he he took that you know that's one thing about gifts that God give you you know the devil can't create he can only pervert what God has created so what the devil does he'll take that gift that God gave you come on and each and every one of us have one you got to find out God didn't just put you here for nothing but you got to give but you got to find out what gift God has given you and once you find out and operating that gift the power of God will be on your life demons are flavor for you because you know what your gift is hallelujah oh Jesus come on y'all believe that tonight come on but what it is he gave it all up didn't he for a woman didn't he he didn't realize that you know by telling breaking that Covenant with God he didn't realize now he was going to be introduced to another world you know and the thing is you know when you're looking at no we don't have time but when you're looking at us thinking I says that you know the whole time when Delilah was playing around with Samson she tied up Samson the Philistines upon me and she had men the whole time down there in the chamber lying and wait about the coming bind them he up there playing around with the devil Hallelujah not knowing that as soon as that he got the enemy down in the chamber lying and wait lying waiting on a chance to come up and destroy you waiting on a chance to bind you up and pull your eyes out don't you know the devil is doing that today come on only reason why he hadn't come up and pull your eyes out yet because God had been having Grace on you God Mercy been there as a brother saying the song tonight somebody praying for you somebody standing in the Gap Lord have mercy on them Hallelujah we play around with the devil though don't we come on oh Jesus Glory God Amen I said but you know what happened you know and it got to that place the way he he came and you know it told his secret broke his Covenant with God didn't he now he he about to experience something he never experienced before in a bad way wasn't he so you see him like I said you see him out there you know and you see him in that condition now what it is bring him out let's make sport of them you know you try to share with people as I was saying Sunday you know a lot of times even with our young people and I try to share with them you know I say the same ones that's begging you come on out here they gonna make sport of you one day same ones that's telling you come on out here we having fun in your Fallen state they're going to make like they're gonna make sport of you they gonna laugh at you I'll share and talking to my aunt you go to jail guess what they ain't coming to help you them same boys that said they had your back same boys that stood behind you when you was out there doing all the Dirty Work you go to jail they won't even send you ten dollars they won't do it you'll never hear from them again why because there was a deception wasn't it but that's what it is you know same one that you know that that one time when they heard his name they tremble and Run to the Hills now they laughing at them because why he was in his Fallen state right and I thought about that even in the spirit realm I said you know it might have been a time where you could get on your knees and demons tremble Hallelujah when you call that name of Jesus or just when you show up the presence of God on your demons tremble might have been a time that way right but when you and your Fallen State you can pray and cry and all that you want to until you repent Hallelujah amen they'll laugh at you Hallelujah you might look the same but they'll laugh at you because you lost your strength you're in your Fallen State you lost your power Hallelujah oh God I thought about so many so many characters come on I don't know God is so good ain't it but I said the thing is that's what it is you know you you want when you pray the demons ain't gonna laugh man right why because they know you ain't in the Fallen State God has given you Dominion amen hallelujah overall unclean filthy Spirits God is you right with God and he said that these signs shall follow them that believe and they won't laugh then why because you in the Covenant with God you write with God hallelujah you ain't in a fallen state but you're doing you're doing what God asks you to do Hallelujah and when you pray demons won't laugh they'll run Hallelujah leave get out Hallelujah you have no Authority here and that's what you want come on in your home that's what you want right your job your family devil you got no Authority because the blood is applied you know when that Death Angel was coming it wasn't that you were so good the blood had to be applied over that door post outside of that you you were just like the Egyptians when the death major came no matter who you were what church you went to you had to have the blood applied same thing today right the blood has to be applied come on God I'm putting the blood over my home oh Jesus let the death angel pass how many want that tonight come on James 1. and and in 13. God is so good amen I know I'm getting all over myself tonight but in His image and likeness come on you know James 1 and 13. we got to say Amen and it reads let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away with his own what lust and entice then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it finished bringeth forth death do not error my beloved brother you know I said man in this Fallen State you know the reason why the whole fall and all those things we know God had a plan and all these things but lust brought that about didn't it come on lustin from for more lusting for more of what something Desiring for the eyes good to the eyes all that's you know the Bible talked about all the things of life right the lust of the flesh the uh the lust of the eyes of the pride of life lust and all those things what it says that you know that all these things when Lusty said when you say you tempted it don't say you tempted of God but you're tempted because of your own lust right the devil know what you like and he tempted you with it come on and you fell because of those things but he said remember when you do all those things and said that's him when lust you know the brain for sin and with sin and when it's done it's going to bring forth death come on it's a downhill spiral ain't it and there's no getting around that sometimes people say well I don't go too far I ain't gonna no it's a downhill spiral come on and in the end what is it going to bring about death but it takes the spirit of God come on God has sent his word but will you hear his word you know I was in prayer today and and something just came to me and said you know you know you think about hard-headed people says and just says that you know people are hard of hearing they can't hear they can't hear God's word they hear it naturally but it's something about he said he that happened ear let them hear Jesus was speaking right but people couldn't hear what he was saying and don't you know it's that same way today people they can hear you speaking they can hear the word being preached but they can't hear what you're saying he said he that happened ear what does it take for you to have an ear the Holy Ghost we've got to take the Holy Ghost to give you that ear to hear that the word ain't just a letter or or some good something you heard but when you hear it through those channels it goes down into the realm of the Soul and it exposes you it shows you where you are Hallelujah shows you where you where you at what you need a little more of God I need a little more of you come on buddy just came to me today I said you know people are hard here and they've heard of understanding come on as I was sharing I believe it was uh a brother Damon the other day we were talking about some things and you know about just about false Doctrine and all and I was saying he was saying that you know he was saying he told me like this said I remember because he was he was real smart so he's studied a lot a little studying a lot of things and he said but I remember you telling me that don't worry about all those other names don't worry about all those other things but there's no power like that in the name of Jesus there's no power he says I don't remember telling him but he says you told me that you know that name Jesus that's the name you need to call on don't worry about all this that name Jesus he said I found out that is something different in that name he said that name he says it does something for me that name he said that's the only name that ever did something for me and I thank God but I began to tell you know my friend brother Damon I was telling him I said you know the thing about it is we're talking about how can this one be deceived how can that one the doctrine and all that thing I said because I says that you know the only reason why we can hear and see in in act and move is because God is is because of by-election I say this election election by Grace nothing you've done nothing you chose nothing none of that come on but before the foundation of the world when God had us in his mind come on he can write our names on the Lambs with a life right there Hallelujah because no matter what where you were born at what family what place the uh Darkness you were in no matter where you were at Hallelujah God knew that one day when he called you you'd hear his voice and all the Demons of hell would have to Turn You Loose no matter what Walk of Life Family you came from God wrote you know his thoughts concerning you wrote your name there and the devil was gonna have to let you go that's what we're rejoicing about not that the devil's a subject but that because our name is written there Hallelujah and the only reason why we see is because election thank God for his grace nothing I've done nothing you done but it's a grace of God thank God he give us eyes to see thank God he gave us ears to hear Hallelujah oh Jesus the devil give us give you so many things that seem like that that'll change the whole world give you this to give you that but you realize Hallelujah that it's more riches in Christ then all the world got off all the money they can throw before God is more riches in Christ oh you can have this or that more money they tell you that all the time come on but there's one thing about it I don't need money when I got God Hallelujah come on he gives it to you but with God I got all things Hallelujah oh Jesus Hallelujah come on don't something do that something in your soul hallelujah thank God I says what it is you know you say you can talk that you know God is my witness so many opportunities this amount of money that amount of money come on but with God God you got all things you know where was that money when I was in them Dark Places where's those opportunities when the devil had me bound when I doing things I ain't had no control of where was all of it then I know where God was right there waiting on me calling my name God was sitting there the whole time waiting on me and when I called on him Hallelujah he didn't worry about the money I had he took me just like I was and he picked me up and put me on A New Path oh Jesus now I'm on my way to heaven like to say and enjoy him a trip I don't know about you but it is it gets sweeter all the time Hallelujah that's why you yell and scream so much try to convince people there's no way better than the way that God got for you there's no plan better than what God got for you can't nobody do you like Jesus Hallelujah he's more than my friend he's my Lord he's my savior he's my God hallelujah he's my healer he's my battle ax Hallelujah he's my peace oh Jesus Hallelujah Can't Nobody Do you like Jesus glory to God come on but I say it's what it is being made in this image come on in likeness God made us in His image come on but man has found himself where in that Fallen state right come on but drawing away from their with their own lust right he said and you know one thing I was sharing with the Bible study I don't want to be long let's share the Bible study the other night says you know me and Charlotte was talking one night and said a lot of times people are say uh you know they always bring up David was a man after God's Own Heart look at what he did David was this and that but you know what time you know what it is sometimes people will use that because they want to cover for their own sins or make an excuse for the reason why they act the way they act or they do the things they do come on but it's one characteristic that David had that a lot of people don't have he was quick to repent wasn't he he was real with it wasn't he he did it wrong he said Lord come on creating me a clean heart and renew the right Spirit In Me come on cast me not away from thy presence wasn't just a song Daddy's song but it was something down in his heart he was always quick to repent not only that I said you can pay yourself to David but do you want to go through what he went through he went through some terrible times didn't he one child killed the other lost a baby one son raped the daughter not the same son that killed the other tried to take the kingdom did all kinds he suffered all kind of things for that didn't he come on but he was quick to repent but we don't use those things come on you draw away with your own lust and all those things that's not come on I said at any time a man's got an excuse for the way he is the way he is that isn't real repentance real repentance come from within where you see yourself naked out before God Lord it ain't nobody fault but my own God I am the way that I am I'm sorry Lord I need your help creating me a clean heart here I am naked before you I'm the man I'm the reason while I am the way I am God will look down on a person like that come on and I believe you'll have mercy on them do you believe that tonight come on I know we just all over the place I said In His Image and likeness God didn't create you to be this way come on God didn't create you just to be that's just who I am God didn't treat you like that but he created you in His image didn't he his likeness he you you should be like to say when we see him we'll be like him he created you to be like him Hallelujah meek and lowly humble and holy that's how God created you come on by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you do what have love for one another come on God created you to be in His image and his likeness how was he walking didn't have a the the foxes had a hole the birds had nests he ain't had a place to lay his head did he walking with dirty feet he came to his own his own received him not come on he didn't walk with his head up proud but the Bible says we esteem them stricken smitten of God Afflicted come on when we seen him there's no beauty that we shouldn't desire them but we hear this and we're our faces from them right come on but God come on gave him a portion with the great didn't he said he'll divide it with a straw what it was God created us to be like him I don't know about you but I want to be like God I said Lord I want to be like you and all of my faults all the mamas all of them every

Ephesians 1 and saying that he said you know God had a purpose in his mind and he knew that Eve would fall because the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and we were in him then are you with me we were in him then and because you were in him then you're here now amen and you're saying what is the land Hallelujah we can sing a new song why did the lamb that was
