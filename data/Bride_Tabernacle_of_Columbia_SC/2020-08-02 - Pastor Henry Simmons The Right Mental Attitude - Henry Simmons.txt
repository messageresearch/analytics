father we thank you now as we look to you lord we love you we appreciate you we thank you god bless your word move flesh back out of the way god that you can get glory and praise in jesus wonderful name amen as we stand and for the word we continuing on with the message the right mental attitudes towards any divine promise will bring it to pass the right minute attitude towards the word of god in proverbs 23 and 7 it says proverbs 23 and seven for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat drink says he unto thee but his heart is not with thee but god bless the reader's word you may be seated the right mental attitude we must amend the way we think affects what we say so our thoughts must be pure but they cannot be pure if in our spirit it's not right david said creating the me great in me a right spirit within amen because he realized his spirit had got off he had uh pursued another man's wife and had the other man killed but he said i acknowledge my transgressions my sins are fair ever before you so david need to get a right spirit i i need lord have mercy on me god i need my spirit to be right created in me i believe that david realized the status or the situation that he was in need of god's cleansing power he knew that he needed hyssop clean me up lord lord i need to be washed early i need a washing i need a cleaning somehow this attitude has gotten the foul brother and sister as he thinketh in his heart i said to the young people on tuesday depersonalize it and to personalize it was to say as i think in my heart so am i as i think in my heart so am i it's not the enemy that's without that defeats you but it's the enemy that's within our defeat comes from within for if you abide in me my word abide in you the devil cannot cross the bloodline he cannot penetrate the word of god and when he was was fortified by the word of god she didn't have to worry about the devil without this only amen when she began to think different when her thoughts began to turn and began to they might think on the things in which the enemy without they met was trying to get into her mind remember god's servant god prophesied the greatest god i ever fought is fought in your mind so you that are troubled amen and think that your enemy is without is something wrong because you are secured because you are under the blood and the enemy cannot penetrate the blood of jesus now we're not just talking about the chemistry blood but we're talking about the life the talk and the life that was in the blood you with me and that is the holy ghost that is the spirit of the living god so brother and sister as i think in my heart so am i we have a lot of problems and we're concerned about a lot of things but those things that without are not amen our problem but our problem is with ourselves because our greatest enemy itself as i think in my heart so am i so amen we have to let this mind be in you that was also in christ they could not do anything that would make jesus attitude change towards them no matter what came upon jesus they could not change his character he loved the world in spite of the world hating him he loved us when we were enemies in our minds by wicked white yet christ still loved us are you with me so enmity and hatred did not change the way god thought about you and i it's very simple and very easily that folks would think that their enemy is one another and not the enemy within so your greatest enemy is not those that talk about you those that you think do you wrong those that borrowed money did not pay back that's not your greatest enemy the enemy within it's what comes out of you determines who you are for you the tree is known by the fruits amen the attributes of god amen that we're concerned about the expression they meant that jesus was the express image of the invisible god and we must even express god's attributes in our lives saint john 1 as i said the right mental attitude towards the word the right mental attitude i find that about 99 of the problems in the church is because people themselves blame somebody else for their own attitude all the schisms and all the divisions and all of our troubles are not because amen somebody else calls it it because it meant the mental attitude that we have as i think in my heart so am i as i think in my heart so am i as he thinketh in his heart so is he are you with me so it's what comes out of the heart that is the thing that defies the man when we perceive evil thoughts amen we cannot allow evil thoughts to come and we perceive them and we amen uh digest them and we think on those things he said think on these things finally my brethren whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are lovely well amen oh god if there's any virtue of there'll be any praise think on these things but what the devil will divert and he'll move your thinking away amen for thinking on the things that god amen said to let your mind be in christ amen set your affections on things above the devil try to bring you down and make you wrestling but god is bringing you into his divine nature are you with me god is lifting you up the devil is trying to take you down in the gutter the devil attacks you into negativity but god is bringing the positive the devil have you thinking evil but god wants you to think good to overcome evil with good to love your enemies amen so the way we love is by separating ourselves and dividing ourselves and hating one another we love that's what we call pure love when we can have our our devices in and think good of ourselves because we're better than this one or we're better than that one and our attitude becomes up and lift up because we're more spiritual we're more holy and we're more godly brother and sister he said the strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak if we're strong amen let's lift one another let's wake up not amen it causes us to go down and amen causes us to begin to be depressed and causes us to have pity parties because amen we figure amen i'm looking for love from without and not within i'm looking for somebody to love me amen when i cannot produce or give love love comes with it within not from without for he said greater is he that within you amen though the greater love has no man the gifts that he'll lay down his life for you are you with me so the great love even in the divine love and their god-paid love and god's love that's inside of the believer amen we have embraced amen the new creation the new man that is in christ jesus the new man that has new attributes that can walk amen in the spirit that can live in the spirit that can walk in the light that can produce imminent kindness gentleness meekness long suffering patience the new man has attributes that's on display amen that folks are seen but i'm gonna tell you the negative minded person no matter how good jesus was amen they still called him visible they meant the negative mind that does not see the goodness of god they would always show you the backside of israel they may they never show you the bleeding lamb the blood that was on the doorpost amen it'll never show amen but balaam wants to curse god's people amen he don't want god's people to be blessed what god told them whom i bless they are blessed and no man can crush you and i'm saying to you the right mental attitude if god before us then who can be against us amen so the enemy that you are fighting is not the outside enemy it's the inner person when you are not satisfied and happy because the bible says the joy of the lord is my strength and the kingdom of heaven coming not with other vation neither shall they say lo here alone there for the kingdom of heaven is within you amen and the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in not outside of the holy ghost but it's in the holy ghost amen get in the spirit amen we must get in the spirit the spirit amen the dwells in you get in the spirit god if i be lifted up i'll drown brother and sister just lift jesus up let jesus be magnified and glorified in your bodies oh let jesus have the preeminence in your life amen all the outside interference it's too long that we've agonized and wonder why this and why that and try to understand the outside but it's not the outside that we're dealing with we're dealing with the inside and inside of god tragedies remember that amen beyond our comprehension beyond all knowledge amen all wisdom god has struggles for you to have and be partakers of that divine nature thank y'all one i got to get there but i'm i'm just kind of caught up because the right mental attitude it's it it's too often that we're actually blaming somebody else for our own unhappiness why we don't have peace and why we don't have joy amen if you don't have it then you don't have the holy ghost amen if you're not if you don't have happiness and you don't have joy and you don't have peace he said my peace i give to you now who took it from you not as the world give give i you amen no man is able to pluck you out of my hand nobody can take god's the joy that i have the world i said the world didn't the world didn't give it in the world isn't that right if the world didn't give it to you the world can't take it but some folks are sitting around mumbling and grumbling and complaining about their status and their spiritual state and their own welfare amen and they're talking about amen oh lord why did amen such a soul brother oh amen oh lord so it's so unsad and why did they do this and i believe the day of this and they are that don't you go running off and they make your own little private vendetta you got to realize who are you whatever you're thinking whatever you're giving out so is as i think in my heart what so what i think about you amen as i think whatsoever man's soul that shall he also reap so he's thinking and he's reaping that so he's actually exercising what he's thinking his thoughts he's acting out on his thoughts and the reason why he cannot speak to you he had to separate himself from you is because his insecurity from within is not without amen love will cover what a multitude of sin amen love amen praise god that is stronger than death isn't that right so we must have the strong one inside of us amen we're coming to a place let me get there i'll just uh skip over and just go right to that verse the 12th verse but as many as for as many as received him to them gave me powers to what become the sons of god even to them that believe on his word see i want to take it from the attitude uh uh from this perspective from the respect the power to become you have power to become the sons of god by receiving him now whether the icon becomes an oak tree it determines amen it determines on the condition amen and some conditions might start the growth it's whether or not things could block the icon from becoming the oak tree a baby one baby young baby girl can become a woman a baby boy can become a young man are you with me but the power to become i'm talking about from baby to maturity i'm talking about amen from posture to complete from partial reality to a full reality are you with me i'm talking about that which is in part being done away with when that which is perfect it's come are you with me so i'm saying power to become some of us amen many had received him to him that them gave you power to become the sons of god but whether you become a son or daughter god is up to you the power is available if you believe but whether you become or not and it's up to you recognize who you are and whom you have received amen it's what amen you have in the inside amen that wants to materialize and come in the very image and the fullness of christ unto the statute of a perfect man so maturity lies within the seed but only through suffering that we bring forth perfection are you with me not the trying of your faith working patience but you must let patients have a perfect word that you may be perfect hallelujah god wants to bring you to maturity he wants to complete what he begun the effort bride or the effort church becoming the omegle the seed that went down in the ground the foundation that were laid by paul the foundation stone and the headstone they meant one are you with me for faith and love coming together the cap the bride into that statue of a perfect man but in the process of moving from faith amen to charity amen you must go through virtue amen you must understand temperance and patience and knowledge and the different aspects of the attributes of god jesus was born a little baby in a manger but at 33 years at 30 years old he stepped in to join and the holy ghost came down in the body shape of a dog and a voice said this is my beloved son at whom i'm pleased to dwell it must come a time of adoption oh you will be god is bringing you an eye into a place of adoption the placing of the sun power to become brother and sister there must be an urgency inside of us as the world is coming to his end that must be oppressing a groaning in the inside because we are looking at something the power to become as i think in my heart so am i what i think about you so am i what i speak about you so am i so good seed i said so good seed are you with me sow it on good ground and it'll bring forth we want 100 phones are you with me now uh first john please i got to skip over a whole lot of things because i don't mean to hold you along but by the grace of god we're on a journey our vision and our attention and our focus must be looking at something we must visualize and we must amen the bible says in the days of noah ever and my imagination and thought of man's heart was continually evil are you with me but we want to our thoughts and our imagination to be holy we want to meditate on his word and we want to think on the things that's going to cause us amen to walk into the dimension of perfect love and that the zoe life of god could come down and express the attributes out of the light that's inside of us the rainbow amen covenant of god but that rainbow amen began to express from those lightsabers and express amen what god is calling for amen is a complete amen covenant in this hour that he made that you and i and that's why he meant he had a rainbow amen on his head amen praise god hallelujah clothed with the sun amen and the moon underneath me i'm saying it's time to realize that the son of a righteousness arrives with healing in his wing come down he met he meant praise god the mighty angel comes off of heaven clothed in a cloud and a rainbow a rainbow a covenant with you and i and as he puts one feet on the earth and one on the sea amen he made a cry amen and seven thunders out of their voices and when the seven understand us out of their voices i was about to write amen and he said the child seal it up to the time of the end but brother and sister amen the time of the end has come and the covenant people must be on the scene to receive the new covenant life that which he purchased he's come to claim they meant by coming down amen in descending in a shout out they've been coming down with the voice the call of people out of revelation 18 come out of her my people we have been summoned to come out the voice of thunder has standard amen and we've heard his voice amen not my son i am amen but the more karma showed down amen maybe not to bring us into a law but to bring us into heaven itself to bring us into full power to become amen sons and daughters of god here we are brother here we are sister we're here to demonstrate we're here to manifest we're here to show the vindication of the word that hallelujah the bride must be on display there must be somebody that will stand and take hold to the king's sword and have faith enough to use it we're not a cycle we're in an hour we're in translation time brother and sister but let me just pause 16 first john 4 and 16. amen i want to say we're going somewhere we're going somewhere and brother and sister you must understand where you're going amen faith come by hearing and hearing come by the word of god amen the word must give you faith and we don't need just faith for healing but we need rapture and faith so there must come a word that will give amen rapture and faith you have the potential amen but potential just won't do it amen it takes quicken and power the potential is in you to become amen but we don't want to just say it amen we don't want to say let it be amen we want it to be things that are to be amen to be amen to become amen we want amen not just to become we want to time out to become has come amen we have come we have come to that time we have come to manifestation time we've come to headstone time we're coming to capstone time we're coming to the summation of all things welcome to the headstone time we're coming to the fullness of time have arrived here now amen to manifest what the word has declared the effort and the omega bride becoming one praise god sane that fell into the ground that comes up they may praise god not in blade or in stalk but in full grain of gad riding in the presence of the sun amen right for what rapture amen for it is harvest time amen the calling of the combine amen praise god oh some are gathered to be burned but you and i will not be burned the tears to be burned but amen to wheat amen we're going out we're going up yonder i said we're going up here now elevate your mind for as i think in my heart so am i as i think in my heart i'm thinking rapture i got heaven on my mind i got ratchet on my mind yes the world has fallen apart yes there's powerless condition dangerous time but i got heaven on my mind i gotta move i gotta move out of here i am in my protection amen is not in the master we wear not in all the precautions that we take but the holy ghost is my protector are you with me thank god for all of these things but praise god it's your hope it's within you you must come to vision and revelation the power that being in the bride amen praise god the power that's in you is the same power that raised jesus from the dead hallelujah but you got to use your resources amen that which god has given you but if you're still caller amen you'll be thinking on earthly things and the devil would have your mind thinking about who said what who done what who did this who did that ten years ago last year six months ago said so and so oh lord but you can turn it around amen what the devil meant for what the devil meant for bad god turned it around to your what so what you worry about because all things work work together to what to the good to them that love the lord so if you love the lord see what i'm saying the enemy is within amen all that we amen are concerned about is because amen we don't have within us that which we supposed to have inside of us if we have jesus on the inside don't you worry about your ship sinking are you with me if jesus is not worried about the wind and the storm amen because he is your peace hallelujah and he can calm the storm hey somebody ought to go away jesus up amen you ought to look away to jesus you already said jesus amen my mind has been wrong amen i've been thinking on the wrong thing i've been speaking the wrong thing have mercy on me forgive me i could not go forward because i was looking backwards and god you don't want us to look back the day is the day of salvation today amen is a new day i'll take one day at a time amen i know amen i'm looking back amen and i don't want to look back no more brother and sister amen your joy is in the holy ghost if the devil could ever take your mind off the holy ghost amen in his presence there's fullness of joy hey god hallelujah brother when we can worship the lord in the beauty of holiness and we can love him for what he's oh what you brought me in the heavenly places and lord i thank you for being in heavenly places lord i love you i appreciate you lord you're so good to me oh how good is our god how great is our god our greatest love towards us oh we don't praise him enough for what he's doing for us and what he's done for us oh we got our minds all messed up but as i think in my heart so am i amen if i think can't matter it's my husband it's my wife it's my children it's my job it's this it is that but i cannot think about that i gotta think on these things hallelujah i got a determination to reach my destination amen i've been predestinated amen and i got a destiny to reach amen i got to clam jacob's ladder amen i'm reaching forward to those things which are before me amen i'm not looking back to those things which are behind me but i'm pressing on the upward way new hikes i'm gaining draining every day amen still praying hallelujah that's my own would bow lord plant my feet on higher ground i got to go higher take me higher lord lift me up where the eagles are for where the carcass is there where the eagles be gathered come on eagles there's fresh manna in the innervale that's fresh manna it's in the innervale come on beyond ain't meant to fail get out of this flesh let's go beyond uh we'll suffer without the camp come on somebody let's go on i'm pressing on let's press on he said keep pressing on because only perfect love can enter there they may keep pressing on amen praise god oh yes there are some that was waiting on you and i am praise god hallelujah they're waiting on us amen you got soldiers of the cross what's going on before us they been there waiting on us amen praise god somebody said my mama is waiting on me amen praise god somebody said sister robinson on the other side she don't have the legs cut off no more waiting on the other side they in that dimension waiting on us amen sister irene amen she's hollering hallelujah pressing my precious brother i'm waiting on you waiting on the bride come on somebody i'm waiting on you amen glory to god somebody waiting on it amen the dependent day without us could not be made perfect amen but there's got to be a time they meant when full maturity perfection sets in amen because that's got to be a perfect day amen praise god what he said the path of the just is of the shine in light was shining more and more until the perfect day i believe the perfect day amen has arrived we're not in the seventh but the eighth day the eighth day comes back to the first day we're back into eternity again if you can amen get it in your mind amen that we have passed from the 70s this is the bride age this is the day amen that god has made amen you must cross over out of the seventh into the eighth day back to the first day or you would be god is moving you out of time into eternity are you with me when time runs out and eternity blends in you and i must blend in to the sublime amen moving into another dimension traveling as a thought amen that that little light come down and scoop you up amen god wants to take you up right to your mind first your mind got to be raptured amen well as he thinks in his heart so is he you must believe that all things are possible to them that i believe so your mind has to be raptured you got to get reaction mind your thoughts got to be there then you can speak what you're thinking you can say come lord jesus and he'll come for the bride his wife has made herself ready praise god it's not ready or not for ready amen hallelujah come lord jesus come on this is what we've been waiting on brother and sister it's got to be a time that you step into the book amen it said this is what we've been waiting on this is what i've been waiting on that surge that anointing that pull that's going to drive us on into amen that super natural that double potion anointing that spirit that energizes that quickens us so much lord brothers and sisters you see what we're experiencing if you're not experiencing a surge of power amen where the revelations are breaking in your spirit that are telling you perfect love perfect love perfect love wake up in the morning it's saying perfect love perfect love perfect love so some it's it's not a work that you work it perfect love is not a work he said add to your faith virtue but are you really added or is it an expression of his attribute they met because everything to make the oak tree is in the sea and everything that we have need amen is in the seed and the seed is the word praise god we got to have faith to believe as the word was in marriage so the word is in the bride or you would be and the word has to potential amen to become the lamb's wife are you with me so what are you trying to achieve becoming one amen not a baby amen as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that they might what grows thereby isn't that right well we're not on milk anymore what we're in the meat age leaving the principles of the doctrine let us go on to what perfection this is the eagle age this is the age of perfection where the eagles eat meat are you up there so here in the eagle age god is required amen praise god the the blood amen not something that's dead and worms in it but god is a requiring fresh manner from above not yesterday's matter but today are you with me praise god and the blood of jesus has never lost his power are you with me it's always fresh you can find healing you can find your sins are forgiven the blood amen praise god has never lost its power not the blood of jesus it has never lost its power brother and sister i got a close in the middle of my uh going because i see right now i'm about to take another turn so i better close out right now but power to become must realize the secret lies within you this the hiding of his power amen god got hidden power and his power is hid from the world amen but in the hiding of his power amen it's hid from the world but it's given to the youth the noted mysteries of the kingdom the church world know nothing about this hidden matter it's the hiding of his power they don't know nothing about the opening of the word and they don't know nothing about the white horse ride and the red hearts rider they
