[35:32] Lord shall deliver them out of them all
[35:35] amen we can trust God even now Hebrews 6
[35:41] and 13 it says for when God made a
[35:51] promise to Abraham because he could
[35:53] swear by no bread oh he sware up by
[35:56] himself
[35:57] saying surely I would bless thee and
[36:00] multiply blind I will multiply thee and
[36:05] so after he had patiently endure he
[36:10] attained the promise for men valid swear
[36:14] by the greater and an oath of
[36:17] confirmation is to them an inn of all
[36:20] strife when God willing more upon the
[36:24] that is shown to the years of promise
[36:26] the immutability of his cancer confirmed
[36:31] it with a nova that by two immutable
[36:34] things which it was impossible for God
[36:39] to lie we might have a strong
[36:42] consolation who have fled for refuse to
[36:47] lay hold upon the hope set before us
[36:52] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[36:56] soul both sure and steadfast and which
[37:04] in turn until that within the veil
[37:08] whether the forerunner is for us in
[37:11] earth even Jesus made in high priest
[37:16] forever after the order of melchizedek
[37:20] God bless the reduce word amen
[37:23] we have a more sure word of prophecy we
[37:33] want to talk to you this morning about
[37:36] we're resting on it
[37:39] I said rest on it
[37:44] amen so topic an ankle of the soul an
[37:52] ankle of the soul my soul has been
[38:00] anchored an ankle of the soul
[38:07] God ankles our soul as I was praying and
[38:15] thinking that they meant in the storms
[38:20] of life we need an anchor that will hold
[38:28] [Music]
[38:30] when the storms of life are read Whitney
[38:37] an ankle servant of God says why he was
[38:49] somewhat caught up in the curtains me
[38:54] beyond the curtains of time looked over
[38:59] there and he saw sinks that have made it
[39:02] over when he saw them that made it
[39:06] although he began to greet them and he
[39:12] said that beyond the cogs of time he was
[39:16] greeted and welcomed but said it was not
[39:25] the judgment time and it was not heaven
[39:28] but it was in the sixth dimension and in
[39:34] that sixth dimension there not as of yet
[39:39] crossed over into the seventh they had
[39:44] not been raptured as a yet but they were
[39:48] in a place where they were rested and we
[39:58] have come to a place where you and I can
[40:03] rush I heard you all when he looked he
[40:12] was going through his trouble time he
[40:15] said about his life it's better for me
[40:20] if I not been born bat him for me my
[40:26] mother wouldn't concede you go to
[40:31] trouble he said there they start looking
[40:37] at the dynamics of life and travel that
[40:41] you have to go through and he said
[40:47] that didn't uh these times he said that
[40:56] there the weary cease from troubling a
[41:02] meant and not that would be a place that
[41:09] they would rest when he was talking
[41:12] about degrees he was talking about a
[41:16] place he meant they meant that he looked
[41:20] at life that he said that they meant to
[41:26] a place that I can rush well that could
[41:30] rest but praise God I want to talk about
[41:37] an anchor to the soul I believe Paul was
[41:41] contemplating and he was looking at it
[41:43] and he was saying in Hebrews here that
[41:50] he was looking at and he says saying for
[41:56] God made a promise to Abraham and God
[42:01] promises something and that promise that
[42:05] God made it him
[42:08] they gave him hope and that hope was to
[42:15] ankle his soul that promise that God
[42:21] made him he meant it was sure it was
[42:27] that fact it was something to anchor his
[42:30] soul I believe God made us a promise
[42:34] something to anchor our soul in and I
[42:39] believe it's a haven of rest I believe
[42:44] that we can rest in hope and the Bible
[42:48] said hope make is that's not a shame
[42:51] they meant when he talked about the Holy
[42:54] Ghost she said why the hope maketh not a
[42:57] say
[42:58] I said oh ankle for the Soul is our hope
[43:07] he met God even gives us hope
[43:12] the wild don't have any hope but we have
[43:17] hope that God made us a promise and that
[43:24] hope ankles also but beyond the courage
[43:28] of time when sinks were in it probably
[43:37] the garbage talking to the sinks that's
[43:39] going beyond the curtains of time hard
[43:42] them see he meant the charge meant has
[43:49] to come and you gonna be gathered with
[43:50] your people and they said to him he said
[43:56] what Paul be judged for what he preached
[44:02] they said Paul would be gathered with
[44:05] his people and he'll be charged he said
[44:10] well if I preach what power preach they
[44:14] meant and it said we're resting on it
[44:20] because I got to preach what power
[44:24] preach and if I preach what power preach
[44:29] you can rest on him I said if I preach
[44:34] what Paul preached you can rest on it
[44:39] for Paul said though we on AIDS or come
[44:43] from heaven
[44:44] pretending out the gospel than that
[44:46] which we preach he said let him be a
[44:50] curse amen well rested on the same
[44:54] gospel he said I wanted to speak the
[44:59] same thing I got to be known among
[45:23] to the same the women will keep silence

[1:22:48] he wants to save and deliver you more
[1:22:52] than you want to be he wants to heal he
[1:22:56] wants to bless you more than you want to
[1:22:59] be bless you only trust him Oh was
[1:23:08] willing because he had found something
[1:23:10] that was more precious to him than all
[1:23:13] that he had attained and achieve so he
[1:23:17] realized that I'm I realized I got
[1:23:19] something that means more to me that all
[1:23:23] this world amen
[1:23:26] so he says yay Dauntless I count all
[1:23:31] things loss for the excellency of the
[1:23:32] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[1:23:36] whom I have for whom I have suffered the
[1:23:41] loss of all things suffer the loss of
[1:23:48] all things that's what I find in most
[1:23:51] Christians they don't mind having the
[1:23:55] power of God but not many Christians
[1:24:01] want to suffer I know but I said the
[1:24:06] sweeten it better it's not gonna be
[1:24:10] every day the Sun ain't gonna shine and
[1:24:12] sometimes we're gonna need some rain but
[1:24:16] we don't want the rain we like the Sun
[1:24:19] but I tell you if you want the crops to
[1:24:23] grow you need the Sun and you need the
[1:24:25] rain
[1:24:27] are you with me so sometimes we have to
[1:24:32] go through some troubles and some trials
[1:24:35] and tests and tribulation not many hold
[1:24:40] out they walk back they believe God
[1:24:42] didn't left them God not with them no
[1:24:44] more the only time they thanked God with
[1:24:49] them when they blessing
[1:24:51] and when they got this and got that one
[1:24:53] then they start to struggle a little bit
[1:24:55] they believe God didn't left them and
[1:24:58] they leave God when they're not getting
[1:25:02] what they want and what they think they
[1:25:04] need they turned it back on God when
[1:25:09] they go through a little trouble a
[1:25:10] little persecution Paul said welcome
[1:25:12] separate me from the love of God Church
[1:25:16] revelation persecution distress said I
[1:25:20] let nothing not things brethren not
[1:25:22] things to come that angels I'm gonna let
[1:25:27] nothing separate me from the love of God
[1:25:29] time folk go through a little trouble
[1:25:32] they give up on God there's not many
[1:25:36] Christians standing no more people go to
[1:25:40] church say they believe the word they
[1:25:44] say they say like the devil they're not
[1:26:01] willing to spend time with God but in
[1:26:05] Romans I pay my tithes and my old friend
[1:26:08] and do this and go through the motions
[1:26:10] and be religious brothers so to take
[1:26:13] more than that it takes a consecrated
[1:26:15] dedicating life to God he sees you when
[1:26:18] you're doing your dark stuff he knows
[1:26:22] when you sneak in here yeah when you're
[1:26:29] having a conversation that is not godly
[1:26:32] and going on God miss stuff he sees that
[1:26:35] he knows it
[1:26:40] why don't you get it right with God -
[1:26:43] stop playing Church they met one day you
[1:26:48] got to get serious and why not get
[1:26:51] serious now brother said well you oughta
[1:26:56] not say these things
[1:26:57] amen have a little matter having a
[1:26:59] patient I'm for you to get right with
[1:27:02] God I stopped Moloch
[1:27:03] reason is we're living in troubled times
[1:27:10] but I believe God wants to anchor your
[1:27:13] soul I believe God want to give you
[1:27:16] something to get you straight with God
[1:27:19] are you up this medicine is good for you
[1:27:26] so he says here I count all things lost
[1:27:35] for the ecstasy of the knowledge of
[1:27:37] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:27:39] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:27:43] count them but dung that I may win
[1:27:47] Christ brother have you won Christ yet
[1:27:51] sister have you won Christ yet what are
[1:27:58] you holding on to he said I want that I
[1:28:01] might win Christ amen
[1:28:05] are you still losing you losing the
[1:28:07] battle something you're holding on to
[1:28:10] causing you to lose but Paul says which
[1:28:16] hope we have as an ankle to the soul
[1:28:22] somebody said we're resting on it
[1:28:25] say here it says that and be found in
[1:28:30] him that's why I want to be found how
[1:28:33] about you and be found in him not having
[1:28:36] my own what righteousness I don't want
[1:28:40] my own righteous you see sometimes we
[1:28:42] please ourselves and we deceive
[1:28:44] ourselves not having my own
[1:28:46] righteousness amen I'm just not
[1:28:51] satisfied with what I think is right
[1:28:54] because I want to be right with the word
[1:28:59] not what I think not what I believe but
[1:29:02] what the word says because what I
[1:29:05] believe might be a little bit open the
[1:29:07] Word of God is the final fact the final
[1:29:10] say-so are you up man so you got to look
[1:29:14] to the word not you could have
[1:29:16] confidence in the
[1:29:17] reachable on your final absolute is the
[1:29:20] word it's the Word of God and you go
[1:29:24] back to the word and see what the word
[1:29:26] said about it and you go by what the
[1:29:29] Bible say not what man say but what the
[1:29:31] Bible say are you up in PO the absolute
[1:29:38] with the Word of God not having my own
[1:29:44] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:29:47] that which is through faith of Christ
[1:29:50] the righteousness which is of God by
[1:29:53] faith that I might know that I may know
[1:29:58] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:30:02] that's alright we don't mind knowing him
[1:30:05] in the power of his resurrection we like
[1:30:07] to see signs and wonders and miracles
[1:30:09] and all the laughs we love when he's
[1:30:13] healing when he's working miracles in
[1:30:16] touching 6 and we get shouting and me
[1:30:20] paying our bills and blessing us on
[1:30:23] every side and oh we shout and dancing
[1:30:26] well what about the bitter when it comes
[1:30:30] what about when the persecution comes
[1:30:33] somebody said they don't like you what
[1:30:37] about when they telling lies on you what
[1:30:41] about when they treat you treating your
[1:30:42] own I believe the Prophet Eli - how does
[1:30:53] she was drunk well you woke me that she
[1:31:01] told him I wasn't wrong see the Prophet
[1:31:05] made a mistake he thought she was drunk
[1:31:10] are you with me
[1:31:14] then she told him it I want a son that's
[1:31:17] why I was agonizing here oh you up man
[1:31:25] sometimes God even let his servant hard
[1:31:30] thing probably like I said he did well
[1:31:34] would you
[1:31:35] the woman said unless she told a lot she
[1:31:38] says well he's well with the sign did
[1:31:40] well he said she day as well somebody
[1:31:43] here but she still said as well why
[1:31:47] because she was calling no thing to be
[1:31:49] knighted to go to learn she believed is
[1:31:52] aware because she got to God Simon and
[1:31:55] she knew all was going to be well she
[1:31:58] didn't give up in a psalm again she
[1:32:00] believed that God was gonna do something
[1:32:02] about that are you with me
[1:32:06] that woman had hope hope the hope is an
[1:32:12] anchor to the soul
[1:32:16] ruled and couldn't have a child but God
[1:32:20] taught as an eyes and the prophet told
[1:32:25] us she gonna have a son
[1:32:27] she said if I have one go god amen
[1:32:33] there's a God of knowledge about him
[1:32:36] actions away and if he give me the son
[1:32:39] I'm gonna give him back to the law amen
[1:32:43] she had faith oh god don't somebody
[1:32:57] believe God today
[1:32:59] but will serving a living God O God to
[1:33:05] look beyond of folks we saw God I didn't
[1:33:18] hear you because he didn't answer what
[1:33:22] you thought you thought eat you'll
[1:33:24] answer some time we keep on praying to
[1:33:28] get what we won't God told me
[1:33:33] folks are pray to me and when they pray
[1:33:38] to me if I don't give them what they
[1:33:39] want they said God didn't hear and they
[1:33:45] said God and they keep on praying and I
[1:33:47] said God didn't hear me yet
[1:33:49] and they keep on praying to get what
[1:33:52] they won't and they tell other people
[1:33:55] pray for me
[1:33:56] I asked a golfer so soon God already
[1:33:58] answered a prayer and they keep a leg of
[1:34:01] meeting God and God said on an a-c yeah
[1:34:06] but they said aim what i wanted i want
[1:34:08] to answer we want God to answer us
[1:34:11] according to what we ask God for and
[1:34:13] what would please us not what God know
[1:34:18] what's going through your soul God know
[1:34:20] what you need and you know what you want
[1:34:25] God don't give us what we were well God
[1:34:29] shall not forgive us what with me so in
[1:34:35] a time God give you what you want
[1:34:37] amen we didn't turn it down so many time
[1:34:40] for what you want but you say God I'm a
[1:34:45] people active in you and I'm gonna keep
[1:34:47] on praying until I get you to do me a
[1:34:50] service but it's not according to your
[1:34:52] will
[1:34:56] so God allows you to do a service that
[1:35:00] not according to his will and what you
[1:35:03] do you suffer for being in a permissive
[1:35:06] will of God
[1:35:07] are you with me because God didn't after
[1:35:12] the way you wanted him to answer so you
[1:35:14] figure well well I said that night
[1:35:17] because I spoke the word and I said God
[1:35:25] this is what I see and God said I asking
[1:35:30] you but you didn't answer
[1:35:33] God told me to tell you they meant you
[1:35:38] need to listen to God that
[1:35:41] and stop bothering with God someone
[1:35:48] won't give up you keep on messing with
[1:35:53] God you won't get something you don't
[1:35:55] need and you wish it never had I don't
[1:36:02] know what you're doing
[1:36:04] garden told you and I can't wait to tell
[1:36:07] you don't ask me that no more just not
[1:36:16] listen some so how I hate it stop being
[1:36:27] hard at it humble yourself listen to God
[1:36:33] I know you folk don't want to hear this
[1:36:39] but you need to hear what God saying to
