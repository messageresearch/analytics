[32:25] online God is so good
[32:33] first John we want to talk to this
[32:36] morning about the sons of God this
[32:39] morning what it really means to be a son
[32:43] or daughter God because many people are
[32:52] there claim it and then naming it but by
[32:56] the grace of God the Word of God to
[33:00] discern the thoughts in the tense of the
[33:02] heart behold what manner of love the
[33:10] father has bestowed upon us that we
[33:12] should be called the sons of God
[33:14] therefore the world North us not because
[33:18] it knew him not beloved now are we the
[33:23] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[33:26] what we shall be but we know that when
[33:32] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[33:35] we shall see him as he is every man that
[33:42] has this hope in him purifies himself
[33:45] even as he is pure
[33:49] who said I committed sin transgresses
[33:53] also the law for sin is the
[33:55] transgression of the law
[33:56] and you know that he was manifested to
[34:00] take away our sins and in him is no
[34:03] sin who said abide in him Senate not and
[34:08] whosoever sinneth has not seen him
[34:11] neither know him little children let no
[34:14] man deceive you he that doeth
[34:17] righteousness is righteous and even as
[34:21] he is righteous he that committeth sin
[34:24] is of the devil for the devil sinneth
[34:28] from the beginning for this purpose the
[34:31] Son of God was manifested that he might
[34:34] destroy the works of the devil
[34:37] whoever is born of God does not commit
[34:41] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[34:46] cannot sin because he is born of God
[34:52] amen in here in this the children of God
[34:58] are manifest in the children of the
[35:00] devil who said what does not righteous
[35:03] is not of God neither he that loveth not
[35:08] his brother we god bless you each word
[35:11] you may be seated
[35:14] this morning as we talk about the sons
[35:18] of God the Bible tells us here that now
[35:23] are we the sons of God he didn't sin
[35:28] when we get to heaven will be a son of
[35:30] God when we die we will be the son son
[35:33] of God
[35:33] let me just broaden our perspective on
[35:36] this as we talk about the sons of God
[35:39] I'm talking about sons and daughters of
[35:41] God and I believe that God was building
[35:48] a masterpiece throughout the church ages
[35:52] and that masterpiece God was hewn out
[35:58] the stone and he was making man in his
[36:02] own image and as the sculpture began to
[36:06] layout the masterpiece he began to lay a
[36:08] foundation maybe it looks to the natural
[36:13] eye like oh just a big rock
[36:17] but it's something that the one that's
[36:23] doing the work he has something in his
[36:26] mind an image and it adds he has an
[36:30] image in his mind he began to go to work
[36:34] was on the stove I believe the Bible
[36:38] says Paul says as a wise masterbuilder I
[36:42] have laid the foundation the foundation
[36:46] has to be laid for the masterpiece amen
[36:52] so by the grace of God God is building
[36:55] his masterpiece his church putting this
[37:00] rock I'll build my church the gates of
[37:04] Hell shall not prevail against it they
[37:07] meant God he meant as he made Adam in
[37:11] his own image in his own likeness God
[37:15] today is building his masterpiece he's
[37:20] making man in his own image they make it
[37:25] his own likeness he said now we decide
[37:29] the god and does not yet appear what we
[37:32] shall be Amen God builds in you and I in
[37:37] his own image and his own likeness it
[37:39] does not yet appear what we shall be
[37:42] praised God but I believe but when he
[37:47] shall appear the Bible said we shall be
[37:50] like him amen and I believe that God has
[37:57] come in these last days that he wants to
[38:01] see man to be like him amen I want to
[38:06] see he meant I believe the purpose of
[38:09] Eve was to reproduce Adam and if the
[38:14] first favorite Eve was a reproduce Adam
[38:19] he meant the Bible tells us in second to
[38:23] riches eleven Lisa the serpent beguiled
[38:25] Eve to assert ility so your minds should
[38:28] be corrupted
[38:29] the simplicity that is in Christ he said
[38:33] why I have exposed you to one husband
[38:37] amen
[38:39] so the husband a meant to the church he
[38:44] meant Adam was Eve husband and the last
[38:48] Adam he meant which is Christ he meant
[38:52] had a wife and his wife is the bride the
[38:56] church he meant and the church is his
[39:00] body are you appear now in it it does
[39:06] not yet appear what we shall be but I
[39:10] want you to know in things that are to
[39:14] be they meant God had you in his mind
[39:19] and he said now you were four days he
[39:24] meant before the foundation of the world
[39:28] so what God had in mind he began to hew
[39:32] out he begin to heal out the mountain a
[39:38] stone that can smote the image on the
[39:42] feet
[39:43] oh you up oh I'm going to fall but let
[39:49] me give you so much there but by the
[39:53] grace of God go back here in simplicity
[39:55] and one first on three and one behold
[40:02] what manner of love the father has
[40:06] bestowed upon us that we shall be called
[40:11] the sons of God therefore the world
[40:14] knoweth us not see if the world know you
[40:19] amen then chances are you're not a son
[40:25] of God the Bible said love not the world
[40:28] neither the things that are the world
[40:29] any man love the world the love of the
[40:32] father's not in him are you with me so
[40:37] there must be a difference between the
[40:39] sons of God
[40:42] the children of God and the tutor of the
[40:44] devil are you up there the Bible said we
[40:48] in pastime was walked according to the
[40:53] course of the world there were by nature
[40:56] two children around but God that's rich
[41:00] in mercy he meant God by His grace heed
[41:05] us and washed us in his blood
[41:10] and because God saved us we don't walk
[41:14] according to the course of this world
[41:17] you has he quickened his made alive who
[41:20] were dead and trust my eyes and you'll
[41:22] see as he fee the two talked about it
[41:25] amen but God has quickened us made us
[41:28] alive even I want you to check your DNA
[41:33] out in order to be a son of God you must
[41:37] know who your father is and Jesus said
[41:43] those that claim to be his children amen
[41:47] they said that we are ever have seeds
[41:50] and we don't be born of fornication they
[41:55] talk down oh Jesus
[41:58] they thought Jesus was born of
[42:00] fornication but he was born of a virgin
[42:03] are you with me so they looked at Jesus
[42:07] as though Jesus did not have the DNA of
[42:10] God
[42:12] even Jesus knew his father was and he
[42:16] knew where he came from he said I came
[42:20] from God and I go back to God
[42:22] he knew that he was aim at the logo see
[42:27] that he knows that he was the very
[42:30] Express image of God even he knew we
[42:35] came from he came from above and he was
[42:37] going back to where he came from
[42:39] he came from being the pillar of fire
[42:42] God above us but he was God with us and
[42:47] that same God that was a bomb in the
[42:49] garden with us it's God in us now
[42:53] and you did amen
[42:56] you gotta check out your DNA do you know
[42:58] who your father is
[43:00] do you know who you are if you
[43:04] understand your DNA and understand who
[43:08] you are then you shall walk
[43:10] circumspectly as I miserly get brother
[43:15] Ernest said not as flus but redeemed of
[43:18] time because the days are evil
[43:20] well you up me we got a mission to
[43:25] accomplish the mission might seem
[43:28] impossible but God put you and I here
[43:32] sons and daughters of God he said for
[43:35] this purpose the Son of God was
[43:37] manifested that he might destroy the
[43:40] works of the devil
[43:41] why do you want me so you need to start
[43:44] this going to the devil are you by the
[43:52] grace of God he said below now are we
[43:59] the sons of God and it does not yet
[44:03] appear what we shall be but we know that
[44:08] when he shall appear we shall be like
[44:12] him for we shall see him as he is Paul
[44:19] talks about now we see through a glass
[44:21] darkly amen but one day we won't see -
[44:27] we we see we understand in Paul we see
[44:30] but what when that which is perfect is
[44:33] come that which is in part shall be done
[44:35] away with they meant so he says about
[44:42] faith hope and charity but the greater
[44:44] is the law brother and sister you got to
[44:48] check your DNA where you come from you
[44:50] come from the great fountain of love and
[44:53] out of love Amen out of that great
[44:55] fountain the logos we're not from God
[44:57] they met and the word were not from God
[45:02] the word became flesh
[45:05] in the beginning was the word the word
[45:07] before it was a word it was in the
[45:13] express it was was was all in a virgin
[46:34] called Mary the Holy Ghost over shouted
[46:37] her praise God hallelujah and out of
[46:42] that Holy Ghost he meant the father of
[46:46] Jesus was she was found with the child
[46:49] the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was
[46:53] Jesus father they met the God is a
[46:57] spirit and a spirit could not die but
[47:02] Jesus was on a mission the Bible said
[47:06] the wit that God was in Christ
[47:08] reconciling the world to himself he said
[47:13] great is the mystery of godliness God
[47:17] was -
[47:18] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[47:21] seen of angels - God came down in flash
[47:32] for they met the word was made flesh
[47:36] how can the spirit in a take on a body
[47:40] how can God take on a body somebody said
[47:44] he was both human and divine God can do
[47:48] what he wants but who has known the mind
[47:54] of God that he's gonna instruct God you
[47:58] can take tell God what he can do and
[48:01] what he can't do
[48:03] God can do what it wants because He is
[48:06] God but what it means for you and I to
[48:22] be sons and daughters of God Amen I
[48:26] thank God that he meant I know my father
[48:29] yes they met praise God many of claiming
[48:33] to be sons and daughters of God they met
[48:37] but God is not a fornicator or adultery
[48:42] are you with me
[48:45] you can't omit John God to a
[48:50] denominational system they met when made
[48:56] up a man made creeds and dumbs they
[49:00] meant he won't be unequally yoked
[49:02] together with unbelievers he meant God
[49:07] in it amen
[49:09] you are if he Amen was born by the Holy
[49:12] Ghost then your birth is by the Holy
[49:15] Ghost your DNA is holy notes connected
[49:19] they meant the life of the flesh is in
[49:22] the blood
[49:23] praise God and the life of the flesh is
[49:26] in the blood
[49:29] desaad came blood and water and he
[49:33] purchased the church with his own blood
[49:35] of the blood came to life praise God and
[49:39] the life that was in the blood came back
[49:42] on the believer on the day of Pentecost
[49:46] showing that the power was in the blood
[49:50] was in sea in the sea could reproduce
[49:55] itself because it was dramatized cannot
[50:03] see because you won't see because you
[50:09] were a part of God because you aim a God
[50:16] who knew you and he attained you to be
[50:20] assured other folks can't believe us
[50:25] they're satisfied would be a member of
[50:27] the church and a part of a church in the
[50:31] system but they don't know who their
[50:34] father here you got to know who your
[50:40] father is your DNA you just are not
[50:48] satisfied with a half-built masterpiece
[50:53] you got to come in the very image of God
[50:58] you got to come into the fullness of
[51:00] Christ Jesus was the fullness of the
[51:03] Godhead body and through our ages and
[51:08] throughout with God began to manifest
[51:10] itself in a Eva ham eyes and then Jacob
[51:12] and began to come on and amen Joshua and
[51:15] begin to come on in the different David
[51:17] and Solomon and different one Jeremiah
[51:19] and Isaiah but the fullness of the
[51:22] Godhead body that was Jesus Christ and
[51:24] all that they were expressing as he was
[51:26] expressing himself in shows about Joseph
[51:29] they met was not the fullness of God he
[51:32] was only fresh in them perfection we
[51:35] look at in that praise God Ava Hammond
[51:40] with the father faith and we look at
[51:43] Jacob Amen and we look at eyes express
[51:48] amen faith hope and charity amen and
[51:52] then perfection through Joseph are you a
[51:55] pair so we need to look at the fullness
[51:59] of the Godhead bodily
[52:01] God amen collectively throughout seven
[52:04] churches bringing a bride on the scene
[52:07] working a work Amen throughout the ages
[52:11] to bring the statue of a perfect man
[52:13] they meant to bring his fullness into
[52:16] the body again expressing his glory
[52:20] again and to a people they meant to
[52:23] express that Jesus Christ is the same
[52:25] yesterday today and forever
[52:28] he meant the power that worked in Jesus
[52:31] or work in his bride or amen the works
[52:34] that I do shall you do also the same God
[52:38] working out himself through you
[52:40] expressing his fullness amen God want to
[52:46] express his life this is it's not about
[52:51] I'm saying is it's not about you know I
[52:56] said some things a lot of people want a
[53:01] certain part of God but they don't want
[53:04] all of God but we ought to not be
[53:07] satisfied with just a potion of God we
[53:10] ought to want all that God is and all
[53:15] that God has in store for us we ought to
[53:18] want all of God are you with me so many
[53:22] people go to church and they're
[53:23] satisfied with a good song or good dance
[53:27] they're satisfied with just a meant a
[53:30] good sermon but you that hunger thirst
[53:33] after righteousness you must surrender
[53:35] you everything your all in all to God
[53:38] I'm surrendered everything and a lot of
[53:42] people surrender are just enough amen
[53:45] to feel good pretty good about
[53:46] themselves but you've got to surrender
[53:48] all to God where God can express all
[53:51] that he
[53:52] once expressed in you sons and daughters
[53:55] of God I tell you don't be satisfied
[53:58] with just a small potion of God you must
[54:01] want all of God the fullness of God all
[54:03] that God wants to do through you and all
[54:05] that God wants to do in you you must
[54:08] want everything everything amen
[54:13] I find if you surrender to a little you
[54:17] get a little what if you surrender all
[54:19] you can get all that God wants to
[54:21] express now the purpose I said the
[54:23] purpose of the sons and daughters of God
[54:26] was a destroy the works of the devil
[54:28] amen now if you don't know what you
[54:31] supposed to do and you don't know who
[54:32] you are chances are you're not gonna be
[54:35] doing what you said what are you doing
[54:36] cuz you don't know who you are see
[54:38] because some folks think Amen I spoke in
[54:41] tongues I got the Holy Ghost but does
[54:43] the Holy Ghost amen
[54:44] now it's not just a tongue just a person
[54:48] it man
[54:50] I want you to know it must be the person
[54:52] must be Jesus in you and if Jesus is not
[54:55] in you Amen you can never express him
[55:01] okay and that's what happens people get
[55:05] tongues and shout they get a prophesy in
[55:08] the shout but you got to get the person
[55:11] and the Bible says God is love
[55:14] are you with me and when you have
[55:18] perfect law he said by this men should
[55:21] know you that are my disciples you
[55:23] clutch because you have loved one one
[55:26] for another amen praise God he said now
[55:29] I want you to know that the conclusion
[55:32] of the last verse that I read he said if
[55:35] you if you say you know God and you hate
[55:38] your brother you're lying
[55:40] amen so he said that it says in the
[55:46] temple or she said in this the children
[55:49] of God are manifest that and the
[55:55] children of the devil whosoever does not
[55:59] righteousness and out of God neither he
[56:01] that what love is not
[56:05] it's brother you know some people have a
[56:08] problem with expressing law you know you
[56:12] got to love the ones that hate you see
[56:17] that's nothing your love is
[56:19] unconditional it's not under the basis
[56:23] of how people treat you you love them
[56:26] what what people say about you what
[56:30] people do to you you love
[56:31] unconditionally you love because that's
[56:35] what you are that's a very character of
[56:37] your father God is love you can't do
[56:40] nothing else about love it doesn't
[56:42] matter what folks say about you or what
[56:44] they done to you you cannot be anything
[56:47] God is identified by his own
[56:50] characteristics Amen if you saw Jesus
[56:53] Jesus would be identified because he's
[56:56] loved and Jesus was the expression of
[56:59] God's love he because he came from that
[57:00] great fountain are you with me and out
[57:04] of God came for the agape love and agape
[57:09] love is a love that the world cannot
[57:11] produce a man I don't care how much you
[57:14] love your mom you love your daddy amen
[57:16] you love your sister you love your
[57:18] brother I don't care how much you love
[57:19] the church I don't care how much you
[57:20] love your preacher Amen I've got pain
[57:22] love can only be expressed you can only
[57:24] get that kind of love from God amen and
[57:28] you was not born with that kind of love
[57:31] are you a man so your DNA amen must come
[57:36] from heaven they meant because this DNA
[57:40] that connects me out to mix my father
[57:42] David Simmons amen amen
[57:46] that's a that's a DNA that I can go and
[57:49] you can take the blood test and show
[57:51] that David Simmons is my father but to
[57:55] know that God is your father amen it
[57:57] takes a faith in the blood of Jesus
[57:59] Christ to reproduce amen
[58:03] the very life of Jesus Christ coming
[58:05] down in you and if that life Amen that
[58:09] was in Christ and then it finds itself
[58:11] in you amen then Christ that was known
[58:14] by his own characteristics when Jesus
[58:16] walk he manifest
[58:17] you got lost and when you walk the earth
[58:21] you got to manifest who Jesus is because
[58:24] why somebody said it no more I do live
[58:27] it but it cried to live in me I love me
[58:31] so it comes a time let's go to Galatians
[58:35] on 2 and 22 and 20 amen
[58:39] I know I was skipping a little bit but
[58:42] it's got to come to a place that you've
[58:45] got to die to yourself amen
[58:48] see in order to break for the life it
[58:50] takes to death amen the call of wheat or
[58:56] whatever goes into the ground and it
[58:58] rottens and it dies and let him come
[59:01] forward life are you with me

[59:09] takes of death somebody had to die for
[59:12] you to live Jesus died for us to live

[59:19] of Abraham died in our stead to produce
[59:23] more sons of God ok 2 and 20 Paul says

[59:45] to the place I'm crucified I got to live
[59:48] a crucified life my life amen is no more

[1:00:10] what he gave to me he gave me eternal
[1:00:12] life and I'm only expressing what who my
[1:00:18] father is
[1:00:19] because I have his blood and his
[1:00:22] attributes are being expressed in my

[1:10:50] Zoe it's God's life when you receive the
[1:10:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost then Zoe comes
[1:10:58] down and so it identifies that the life
[1:11:04] that's in you is not your own praise God
[1:11:08] it didn't come through Charlotte Martin
[1:11:12] and David Simmons of Charlotte Simmons
[1:11:16] and David Simmons but it came in the
[1:11:21] life that I now live it came from God

[1:11:29] birth praise God that I exceed that
[1:11:32] birth over my natural birth Amen thank
[1:11:37] God for my dad and thank God for my mom
[1:11:42] they meant but I got a mess a DNA that's
[1:11:46] what heaven praise God and I'm looking
[1:11:49] at the word image and I'm looking at a
[1:11:53] bride that's going to be the word in the
[1:11:55] last day and she's not going to be
[1:11:58] identified with some church title of
[1:12:01] some church denomination or some
[1:12:03] preacher Amen it won't be Bishop Simmons
[1:12:07] or pastor Simmons it won't be Bishop
[1:12:09] so-and-so on a pastor sort so it won't
[1:12:12] be prompted so-and-so on a property this
[1:12:14] it's going to be Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:18] so Jesus Christ is the one that God is
[1:12:22] going to ought to me yeah you're gonna
[1:12:24] have to serve are you with me so a lot
[1:12:29] of time often times people are trying to
[1:12:33] present an image an image of Daniel
[1:12:36] image of a man and we were reflecting so
[1:12:40] much internal image of the carnal they
[1:12:43] meant as if people were reflecting to
[1:12:45] I'm appalled and I'm a thief listen i
[1:12:50] polos there were a reflection they meant
[1:12:54] their DNA amen as though Paul was the
[1:12:59] one that died for them in stole a Paul
[1:13:02] that wrote most of the New Testament yet
[1:13:05] in Nepal a met description he says who
[1:13:09] is Paul or who was a polis or whose Seif
[1:13:11] was a who's Peter amen whose upholds
[1:13:14] these are of great apostles and men of
[1:13:16] God that you can hold to the image and
[1:13:19] hold to their likeness and you could
[1:13:21] extend them so some of us would separate
[1:13:23] ourselves and divide ourselves and I'm a
[1:13:26] I'm on this denomination I'm on that
[1:13:28] denomination we divide the church amen
[1:13:31] because we have schisms and in terms and
[1:13:33] we divide the body of Christ but Bible
[1:13:35] said Christ is not divided they may cry
[1:13:40] is not divided it's just one God amen
[1:13:43] has one that died for us he meant one
[1:13:45] planet or the water but God that gives
[1:13:48] the increase are you up man
[1:13:50] so I want you to know amen you got to
[1:13:53] watch amen amen there's one thing that
[1:13:55] when folks see Amen who we worshiping
[1:13:58] they meant the only one that we were
[1:14:01] watching in is Jesus Christ and he is
[1:14:02] the word oh you want me we ought to
[1:14:06] point people to one that's one God amen
[1:14:09] and he's Jesus Christ and he is the word
[1:14:11] we don't poke people to a church with on
[1:14:14] poor people to a man without people to
[1:14:17] an image we poke people to Jesus Christ
[1:14:19] and he is the world
[1:14:21] are you with me and if people are
[1:14:25] pointing in any other place amen
[1:14:27] I'll tell you sometimes when we please
[1:14:30] we make the Word of God secondary but I
[1:14:33] want to tell you something he's second
[1:14:35] to what he's second to none they met
[1:14:39] cheap the Word of God is fresh it
[1:14:41] doesn't matter what your child said what
[1:14:43] your preacher said it doesn't matter who
[1:14:45] the man where he comes from the Word of
[1:14:47] God is second to none they meant the
[1:14:51] word must be first this is the first
[1:14:53] book they meant this is the only book
[1:14:57] that God's gonna go by in charge every
[1:14:59] man by what's written in the book
[1:15:01] oh you will be now you might pull out
[1:15:04] another book you might pull out another
[1:15:07] man but I'll tell you this one man
[1:15:08] that's Christ Jesus he gonna change the
[1:15:11] world and righteousness are you up man
[1:15:14] so people better get and put them on a
[1:15:16] map put the word in his right position
[1:15:20] they mean you got to put Jesus Christ at
[1:15:23] the head of the church are you with me
