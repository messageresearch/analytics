blessed Thy word for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen [Music] if you have your Bibles should turn with me to the book of the Galatians the sixth chapter it's good to be in the house of the Lord Galatians 6 4 through 10. but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoiced in himself alone and not in another where every man she'll bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap shall his flesh reap corruption but he that saw it to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us be not weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we think not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially until them who all are the household of faith let us pray father God we want to thank you tonight God for your mercy and your grace Lord God I pray God for your people Lord that you look upon every situation and condition Lord and God we know God that your word is true father and we are so grateful God for your promises in this hour that you're given to us Lord we are holding fast to these things oh God our faith is anchored Lord in the things that you have given to a Hallelujah in this hour Lord your precious promises in Jesus name amen may be seated I want to speak just to you a few minutes and not mean to be long tonight at all on a little thought of don't be weary in well-doing don't be weary in well doing the scripture says that if you sow to the flesh you'll reap corruption so everything that you and I do we want to do it as unto the Lord I always say it and telling the church back home whatever you do for God let it be real let it come from your heart that that's what you really want to do for God you know sometimes sometime you know I think about a pastor and the laboring some things that we'll never know that he does but I say God sees the labor the love the sacrifice that one makes sometimes never even known by people but God sees and I believe God is just the scripture said whatsoever a man so he will reap I believe if I remember correctly at the end of every Church Aid there was a reward for those that the scripture said in the end of it he had an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and church I want to tell you tonight don't be weary of what you may be doing and not seeing by men I believe what you do when you don't people don't see it's a greater reward because only God knows the things that one does and he knows the purpose and the reason why one does it understand one thing is that you do it uh for the wrong reason no profiting that because that's you but when you do it out of an unselfish thank you selfish motives and uh it's not about you I believe the everything that God did he did it for us when he gave his life he he did it not for a selfish reason but he did it because he loved us and one of the reasons he did it to uh bring us back to him again to reconcile us back to himself because we were a part of him and now the servant of God savior you wasn't a prayer to God then you won't be a part of God now we understand that we have been chosen and predestinated by God for this hour right here and God has chosen us the Bible said he chose us and we didn't choose him we only accepted what he had done for us and when we heard that word what did it do it did something on the inside of us and not really even knowing what we were doing really but God knew what he was doing he was a reconciling his family back to him again I I think about those things uh I tell you what this is the only thing y'all know he missed it all the time but when I think about it it makes me want to shout because I know that um that I'm not even deservable of of what he has done for me all of us and our own should have been dead we should have been cut off and lost but but God had mercy and I would say he had extended Mercy Oh my he had to go way down to pick us up but nevertheless how low you were God didn't look at that God said in spite of he said I'm going to get him anyhow because they belong to me Satan thought he had you but God said Mercy said no and he reached beyond all the boundaries and all what you were doing and what you were into he said ain't nothing too hard for me oh my God somebody said I don't know why Jesus loves me I don't know why he care but I thank you Lord and just that mental thing that I grasped me my mind you know as you look back at your life and and you realize uh what God done and how he done it and and let me tell you something we wouldn't even do that for our own self many of us didn't gave up we didn't count our own self as lost and cast away and then watch God that wasn't about to say you know um you know don't account nobody out and what don't judge nothing before that time because what looked bad now God can turn it around brother Marshall's thing the worst of the worst oh my I mean the loss of the Lost that destitute it that hopeless cakes that uncumer disease God specializes the song saying I like to say like this he just don't specializes in something he specializes in everything and the way he do it is beyond our comprehension always tell the people that come that God don't even need nobody permission how he do it he does it and people try to figure it out and God already doesn't work it out that's why I believe that a Christian Life ought to be a life of rest what are you going to worry about what are you worried about little bride you say fear not little flock come on God got you oh my God there is no sin that's worse enough there's no condition that's deep enough that God can go way down and pick you up and I believe we are eyewitness that God had to come pick us up I know where I was God came nobody came to do that work that he did but he sent his only begotten son and now here we are in the end of all things everything seemed to be chaotic everything seems to be out of control but I want to tell you God Specializes I'll be somebody say in the darkest hours that's when Jesus comes or the doctor that it gets then the light began to show a little more brighter you and I know we're living in a dark age very crucial very uh satanic power the diseases and all kinds of things on every hand seemed to be going on this way that way everything just seemed to be in a pure mess but tonight we got peace peace because we know that Jesus can calm the storm I'm reminded when he was on the ship in the bottom of it and the disciple was on top talking about the goodness of the God and all of a sudden the ship stopped rocking and blowing storm begins to come against the ship where they were at server to God so you think it's Jesus was really sleep you said no I don't think so but he was just resting they were up top testifying about the things and but when the storm came their faith got shook they begin to wonder the ship was about to be described where is Jesus you see he's on the bottom let's go wake him up I believe sometimes we got to go wake Jesus up when your ship began to rock in the winds begin to blow against your life you got to wake Jesus up and he's waiting sometime the way God does it he loud the storm to come you think he worried about the storms you think he worried about the storm that even coming against your life come on he wants you to know I'm on the ship and you got to stir up him and you again see yeah you got to know that no matter how low you get no matter how bad the situation is I'm there he said I'll never forsake you neither will I leave y'all not only will I be with you but I'm going to be in you everywhere you go he's there somebody said if you make your bed in hell he's there he's everywhere don't be weary in well-doing because we understand there is a reward there is a crown for those that endure many may have started out but the race not given to the Swift but can we endure whatever it is that we have to endure in this life right here you and I know that life don't come like we wanted to and things don't be like that God allowed to ship the Rock and the wind to blow what is it you want to see now can you still trust me can you still have confidence me in the midst of what you're going through what did he do he's pressurizing y'all he wants you to know you can't take more than what you think I've been about to say he don't put no more on you than what you can bear and I know it gets hard especially when it comes down in your own house oh you wonder sometime Lord Master do is not care rather be busy yes I care he said you just be still and watch the salvation of the Lord be still do don't worry you know how it gonna happen and you tell us because everything is in the Master Hand everything you do and everything you dealing with and going through it's in his hand God just didn't save you to lose you God ain't in that kind of business but we're going to do he said I'm going to prove those I'm going to prove my people he that that they are worthy of what I've done for them now see job had no idea that God in the Satan was talking about him down there he was going about his everyday life and doing everyday thing but but there was a conversation about Joel because you know God said you know you considered him he said yeah you got a hedger on him show he but remove it drove and had no idea what was going on in heaven and I know it I'm quite sure that thing going on about us and see God got more confidence in you that you got in your own self because he put something in Joy he put something in you and I that he understand listen they may Rock and they may lean but they won't deny me they even make you a little weary and little This and like that but don't worry they're waking up again so I'll see you tonight don't be weary you know well doing don't think that God don't see your labor of love that you have toward him not only him you know sort of God say in order to have the love to God you know he said to love his people he said you can't love God and don't love his people see because as you did it to the least one of them you've done it unto me and you don't know who that lease is sometimes there'd be angels unaware sitting right side the road and God allow you to pass by that burger that person who helpless or maybe uh you know not fortunate as you are and God allow you the opportunity just to show a little love to that person you see so you don't know who you are entertaining could be angels but if you misrepresent God the wrong way that's why I want to be careful what I do and I just don't want to mistreat anybody not intentionally no I'll be the Bible say here let me read that correctly tenth verse you say as we have therefore opportunity let us do good to all men and then he said especially unto them who are of the household of faith in other words especially for those who are like Precious saints of God I wonder sometimes we'll realize you know when we treat one another certain ways that you're treating God when we get conscious enough and reverence enough that I can't treat this one in any kind of way I can't just say anything that could because why because they are the household of faith he said especially in other words there's something special about those of the household of faith you know I really when I hear the things the servant of God said how he really treated people even those that didn't even agree with his men agree with what he was doing he still regarded them that's my brother that I've been listening to a message of the night and uh it was a debate and brother uh Bosworth I believe was on the platform with a guy that was trying to show brother ran him up and debate and all and he was an older man and he just sat there talked to the man coming in scripture and and then um the guy said a lot of ugly things you know about the servant of God and and brother Banner finally came down you know and you know he said he said listen my brother you got a right to disagree you know what he didn't treat him no different and not only him even just some of the vowel people that uh brought accusation and did all kind of things to him he still had enough wisdom you know I'm saying to treat them like a brother and I said you know it's a shame that the example he had it was the same it was down to that Christ had you know he loved the unlovable even those that didn't agree with him I mean always said it's okay to be disagreeable there's nothing wrong with that you know I mean this because we don't see eye to eye on everything they said that you know but that don't make us odd well in a way it might do but you'll peculiar in your own way I always tell you all the time what if God wanted to meet everybody just like you you wouldn't like that so God he said got a uh a variety flowers and bouquet and different countries different nationalities but with the same Spirit you still God I wanna be his first Corinthians 15 don't be weary in well doing no sometime we to feel like you know nobody really care because sometimes the way people may handle things uh I treat you sometimes it's like sometimes they do have a maybe a nonchalant attitude toward it they don't really see the urgency that with the hour that we are in right now with so much going on and this new thing they got comment control cop 27 all kind of different things that they are trying to Institute and they're pushing talking reiterating into one world order system bringing everybody all the world religious leaders to a great Gathering to set some standards you know on comment control and things of that nature in First Corinthians 15 and 58 therefore my beloved brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord you know that's why you know when we uh whatever we do you know we want to do it according to what God put on our hearts but we don't want to do it separately or grudgingly we ought to do it because of the love of God that's been shared abroad because everything you do for God you will be rewarded for it and if you decide to do evil you're going to rewrite be wrong for that too God is Not mocked someone said well I ain't gonna do nothing but then how do you expect to get a reward for nothing but everybody whether they know it want to believe it or not you were doing something but I want to do that which is right I want to do that with God had laid upon my heart and regardless if nobody know God knows if nobody sees there's nobody never you know yet sometimes say everybody love a little pat on the back but the detailing things that people do you know it don't have to be known maybe something you said here he said don't never be weary in well-doing for you will certainly reap in due season if you think not always do that which is right and whatever that God has said in his book The Bible you believe that where you can hang your soul on any phase of the word of God you believe that don't you now whatever he has promised in the word that God will do for God is under obligation to his word I like that he's on the obligation to his word that's why he said abide let my word abide in you see let the words stay let it remain let it remain in you'll see God got to have something to work with and that's why we you know austelli David said like he said Lord uh let me hear that word in our heart that I may not sin let me hide it in my heart that I mean I sinned against you see because God is the word he said look at this Junction between separation or right and wrong and Abraham what a Time Abraham seemed like and he got the Raw Deal it seemed like tonight because that you were separated yourself from the things of the world that you got a wrong deal don't be wearing well doing for in due season you shall reap he that endureth unto the end Jesus said the same shall be saved just looking on keep moving slowly God knows what he is doing we're the only one gets in a hurry not him he let the Hebrew children walk right in the fiery furnace before he ever turned a page over to about a new article sure God's in no hurry he know what he's doing what he's going to do we don't but we believe it by faith because he said he'll do it amen how many of you believe that God ain't in a hurry God sometime and let it get so bad so low he never get that way sometime as I've seen even in certain people doubt the case is helpless that they can't even find nothing to help the people with now it come the time are you going to trust God thank God for medical science I appreciate them but we understand the Medical Science can't go but so far and even beyond that even if they would have given you something to make it better for you he said God is the one who got to do the healing they can set a bone and they can break it but God has to heal he said it's only a Aid to God but God is the Healer church I want to tell you tonight don't be weary in well doing for whatsoever you sow you will reap God bless you appreciate the word tonight don't be worrying well doing whatever man sowed that chili also read I tell you they sang a song I'm not tired I'm not weary in this way this holy way the Lord God is my shepherd and I shall not want I'm not tired I'm not worrying in this way this holy way God is good amen thanks to God get all the energy energy you can get and when you don't have no energy do the sacrifice the sacrifice of praise praise God give God all you got because if you don't give it to God don't use it you lose it if you don't use it you lose it but if you give God all you got and be happy in doing it brother Jeremiah say don't not grudgingly but you're giving him all you got and you want to do it Lord I love you and I and I don't care amen and I won't take it back I love the Lord and I won't take it back so I'm going to give God everything amen everything I got it belong to God praise God everything we have blown to
