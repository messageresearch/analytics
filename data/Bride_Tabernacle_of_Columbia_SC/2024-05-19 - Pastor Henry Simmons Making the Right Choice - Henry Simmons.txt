every need in Jesus name would you bless your word this morning in Jesus name amen God is good in Hebrews 11 here 24 I thought I might be somewhat repetitious but nevertheless they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God 1124 this old message God servant spoke by faith Moses and he says by faith excuse me that's a 24 let's go to 23 please it said by faith Moses by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king Commandments 24 church will you read chosen rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God then enjoy the pledges of sin for a season 26 by SL he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as Sin him who is what invisible invisible I'll stop there God bless the reading this word you may be seated you know it's something to see him who's invisible Amen to see him who is invisible by faith he saw him who is invisible to cease him that's invisible you saw it thank God by faith you know I I I I thought on uh Moses in his decision and we must make the right choice making the right choice we must choose we make many choices in life but when it comes down to your Eternal Destiny something about something about within us it's everybody don't have that everybody that walks to Earth though Jesus died for the sins of the whole world and everybody just don't have that thing that uh as sister kha was saying I want to please God everybody don't have that desire that thought in their heart and that thought in their mind that I want to please God everybody don't even uh uh even want to serve the Lord even want to but it it is a hunger and thirst in everyone the young people today that says you know I'm spiritual H where this coming from I'm spiritual uh you know I I don't read the Bible I don't go to church but I'm spiritual and I'm hearing that more more especially because I guess I'm around a lot of black people I'm hearing that out of the youth in the black community I'm spiritual so you can't tell them you know that that's wrong to do cuz I'm spiritual it's all right with with my I don't know what they call it I don't know where they at but by by the grace of God we have a a Bible that people used to respect you know but nowadays we don't know whether people respect the word of God we used to respected when I was a little boy coming up in school elementary you know you said the prayer and they went around the class and you had to say thou sh not steal thou sh not do this you know say a Commandment that was in public school everybody you know s a little verse had prayer first pledge of leing to the flag and stuff like that and you went through the Bible that there no fear of God they took prayer out of the school you can't pray you can't can't do this so the world is gotten so terrible so lost they said they got to do something with the Supreme Court now because they bias C our Supreme Court is no good no more because they're not judging by the law they're judging by the politics whether I'm a Republican or whether I'm a Democrat and they have no checking balance nobody can check them whatever they say it's final so they said we got to do something brothers and sisters we're headed the country is falling apart everything is falling apart coming to church and the church could be political and we know that the denominational world is political am it's going to be one world order one World Church and the World Council of churches you got to be a part of it if you ain't a part of it amen and to be a part of it you spiritually you're dead a lot of churches are already a part of it spiritually dead you dive when you go into it are you with me spiritually are you with me so in Deuter Romans 30 Moses made a decision a conscious decision you and I are in this world and how come I got to make a decision can I just can I just be me do I have to do I need to make a decision can I be me what's wrong with me being me can I just live can I just exist and just be me and I think sometimes we feel Untouchable and I don't want nobody to invade my privacy so I want to be me so leave me alone life is not like that you going to be invaded one way or another whether you like it or not somebody going to interrupt your privacy and you going to have to you know make decisions that you don't want to make all you got to do is live a little while and you'll find yourself you have to make sound decisions you have to make choices in life you got to make choices whether not I want to do right or whether I want to hang out with the gang and whether I want to be a gang banger or whether not I want to be a Christian or whether not I want to be go to school go to college whether or not I want to a a career I want to take a trade I have to make a decision in life because I got to have something to be able to help me to navigate through life if I'm going to live on the earth I got to have some tools to navigate and I I want to I want I want to be comfortable so I got to do something what I want to if I just want to exist and I want to just hang out I got to find myself I got to find what I want what I want to be what I I got to make a decision get in high school and I said your best time in your life y'all young people best time in your life enjoy it cuz after a while you're going to have to make a decision I'm going need go to college or going to work or something but you're going to have to make that decision I stay with Mama Mama and Daddy they can't mom and daddy say you got to go you got to make a decision you getting grown enough I've taken you as far as I can take you now it's time for you to be on your own are you with me but it's if the responsibility is always on somebody else and not on you and you don't learn to except that you got responsibilities and you got to make decisions for yourself mama can't make them daddy can't make them amen the church can't make them the preacher can't make them you got to make your own decision you got to your choices the choice that you make you got to live with it or you got to die with it are you with me Deuter ronans uh 30 and 19 it says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you what now why why why it was like that in the beginning he said every tree of the garden you may eat but the tree of knowledge and good and evil you don't touch it don't eat it because if the day you do it you're going to die every other you can eat every every every other tree but don't touch that one are you with me said why why you going to do that to us I set before you life and death you choose why you put that on me I I I want I don't want to make no decision why why I got to why you going to come at me like that why why you coming at me like that leave leave me alone but it's real I set before you life and death okay I know you want to be left alone but we can't leave you alone brother and sister you're going to have to make a the decision ision and I'm saying making the right decision Choice making the right choice of the right decision I tell you you y'all ever got a a call this is T what you say I'm sorry they said I I'm sorry excuse me I'm not interested I said I'm not interested please I don't want to be I don't want to be rude but I'm not interested I you know I'm sorry I don't want I know it hurts I I feel like it hurts I don't want to hurt you but will you please I told you don't call me no more what but this is the police um uh uh what you call them and we taking up money for the man I done told you leave me alone I said can you understand give me a break well you see what I'm saying life is like that you may want people to leave you alone you may want to keep your space and you may want people not to invade uh your telephone your your life and or whatever people ask you questions that you're not comfortable with people are going to uh ask you who you are what you are where you are say you know I remember as a young man it's teen you have a lot of pressure you know as a as a team by the time you get in junior high school it's all kind of pressure where your girlfriend man huh you just you that come on leave me alone but folks ain't going to leave you alone some folk tell lies some folk just try to you know just get me get get anybody if you ain't got nothing I'm going to give you one here your friend say huh you you can have I'm I'm I'm your friend I'mma I'm going take care of you you know how how your friends take care of you know then you got to make a decision whether I'm going to stand I'm going to let my friends go out and get me somebody goz they they figure you need somebody are you with me so your friend say Hey you ain't got nobody I got somebody for you is she looking looking you sweating she might be sweating what I'm going do what I'm going do is you what what am I do let me tell you decisions you got to make decisions and choices cuz if you don't make it your decision your choice somebody going to make it somebody going to make it for you are you with me but you got to choose that am I going to be independent or am I'm going to uh take a stand for myself that nobody have to when I'm going grow up when I can be independent and I can take a stand and I know where I stand hey I can take care of this for myself I got to when I got a little older I said hey don't y'all make that decision for me let me make my own okay I got it but I had to get a little older during High School I couldn't make those decisions because people made decisions for you you know I wasn't ready to to do those things that they wanted me to do I wasn't prepared to do it I wasn't ready I didn't know what was going on you see I don't know what I'm talking about this morning why I'm talking about this some things you ain't ready for but you feel pushed into it when you ain't ready for it you don't know how to handle it and you ain't ready to handle it but sometime you're pushed into it are you with me so you begin to accept it because you don't want to be left out and look like you you don't fit in you're not a part so the decisions that you make sometimes it's to satisfy not you but it's to satisfy the crowd your choices is not that I'm making this choice that I want to make it I'm making this choice because I don't want to feel left out are you with me though I'm not ready to make the decision I'm being pushed I'm being pressured into making decisions that I don't want to make right now I'm me I'm not ready for these decisions not ready so somebody believe that it's your season it's your time you should make this decision and you make decisions and once a decision is made sometime we uh what we do we make the decision and then we're sorry I'm sorry sorry sorry I made the decision but here's a decision that you can make here is a you can make the right choice this morning the right choice when it comes down to your soul and what where you going to spend eternity you can make a sound solid decision in your sound mind amen understanding that nobody's pushing me nobody's trying to make me do it it's out of my own desire I want to please God I want to serve God I want I love God it's my decision nobody making me do it nobody forcing me into it okay he says I call record um you choose life amen I said before you this day the 19th verse it says that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore what choose life that both thou and thou seed May what live now let's back up to the 14th verse of the same chapter 30th chapter it says but the word is very n thee in thy mouth mouth and in thy heart that thou may do it 15th verse says see I set before you this day what life in good you know have you thought about it if you thought about you just walking through life and just you know just doing and not even recognizing that God is say I set before you life and good but you know you don't understand I'm just passing through I'm not even considering that I I'm makeing I made a decision I'm I my lifestyle is the decision is a product of the decision that I made I made I chose this lifestyle e even if I was persuaded by others even if I was push or pressing into it I made the decision are you with me so he says life and good then he says and what death and evil when you say evil you know we either it's good and evil it's bad and good now now am am I My Lifestyle am I saying is evil oh I ain't evil I'm not evil call me I'm not I a evil okay fine okay let's go on he said good and evil amen and that I command thee this day oh Lord let let me go somewhere else let's go to Joshua 24 Joshua 24 why I started talking about it before I get there 24 and4 it says now therefore feel what feel the Lord and what you know a lot of people serving the lord but not in they're not sincere they sing they you know they come to church but they people ain't a lot of times it's not sincerity a not they're not in it their heart is not in it they're not sincere about their walk with God when you when you really sincere about you know some people come to work I I used to wor people didn't care about the patience and I looked at them and I look at the patient suffering and I say okay I remember uh this lady she was a little overweight and then they bought her back from someplace and she was on the stretcher it looked like the stretcher was pressing her body and I said I looked at her I said oh I see but I saw her crying I says okay I know if I call for help and nobody want to help me I said somehow I got to get her out of this pain so I kind of put the brakes on the stretcher and I put the sheet and pull one side other side and I put it in the bed I had others I pull back the sheet and they all saw and everything nice clean white sheet on top like somebody has washed them and took taken care of then I look at it and I see the bed swords and all and I just this is what I got so I got to clean them off I got to take care of the bed soes I got to do this because somebody don't people have been negligent they're working they get a paycheck but they ain't to sure about what they doing are you with me they're hard in it they just want the paycheck and a lot of folks you know they just want to go to heaven I just want to go to heaven but my heart is not in but I said you know it's something about when you're different it's something about when God you know I was just coming to the Lord and my first patient had everything they say in the book I said my brother said you know what I would have done I to put the Sheep back over I come up and that would have been it I would going to do that but he didn't last in that in that job cuz he wasn't going to do it you know what I'm saying and I said I couldn't you know my Tears start coming to my eyes I why did it people leave this person in this condition you know what I'm saying and I'm saying to you you got folks that hard is in Lord I want to really please you I'm sincere about my walk with you I want I I I want God with all of my heart I think God is he took me before I got to the pull pit he took me to the hospital and you know what I'm saying and people was director nursing says Henry we want want to we want to give you a scholarship we going to pay your way to any school to the school and we're going to pay for your I said huh anything you want to be we'll pay for it so I said well I don't I I can't find myself the decisions they wanted because they saw that you car when people see you care you don't know who's looking at you and see that you care evidently it had reached the director of nursing enough to call me in the office and offer me can we do something for you well nevertheless we going to raise your pay but don't you let nobody know we raising you okay so by the grace of God when you don't even know what's going on behind the scene you give your best to God somehow the angels are reporting to God they are saying to God you see that's one of your faithful children are you with me even the devil told God that I uh Jo I know he's serving you but he ain't serving you for nothing you got to hedge about him are you with me he he he didn't say you know Jo God what you saying about Job ain't right but you got a hedge about him but if if you move the Hedge I'll make him curse you to your face what happens if the hedges move what happens if God desire to test you what decision would you make would you run would you give up on God will you say God I don't want you no more I don't serve you no more I don't believe you no more because you shouldn't have let this happen to me sometimes we don't know we're going through a test and we're going through a trial and we don't understand why but how are we conducting Our Lives how are we handing the pressure the decision the choice when we are at the lowest what kind of choice do we make do we make the right choice do we choose to do the right thing when everybody else want to do the wrong thing am I going to do the right thing I'm being pressured I'm being pull I don't want to do it but I got to CH in because everybody else is doing it the choice that when the spies came back to spy out the land they made a decision that we can't take the Land There was 12 of them it was 10 said we're not able but there was only two that made the right decision we're more than able to dick and to the eyesight they couldn't because they were looking at amen look like amen the the walls was high the the the they were fortified and it was impossible for them to do it but something about Joshua and Caleb inside of them that said With God all things all things are possible we can we can the land is ours we can take it because God gave it to us God gave it to us I make the right decision amen if about to stand by myself of all the everybody else in the church want to go with them let them go if there's nobody left but me Joshua I'm going to keep it I'm G to stay with the word I know what God said about it and because God said it that's who I don't care God said the the land is ours I give it to [Applause] you I made the decision I'm resting on it praise God I'm resting on it praise God I I'm contented praise God look that two million people amen decided they not uh-uh if you got two many two million people against you and you decision is right and all of them wrong all of them is wrong have you heard that before seem like I heard it echoing in the spirit realm y'all two the only one right here just you and Caleb Joshua they didn't see what I saw those those you know it's causing where you are amen what you looking at it's a calling what you're looking at the prophet said Look Away to Jesus it's causing what you see when you look and it's causing amen praise God what you're looking for when you look are you with me if you're looking for the wrong thing you going to see the wrong thing are you with me when you look away to Jesus praise God you see amen we well able we're well able the land is ours hey I don't care how big and how bad they are I don't care how serious this might be amen my God is more than able I don't care if it's stage for cancer I don't care amen praise God what it is I don't care what they say Amen we're more than able amen yes amen I made my decision I made my choice am and I think my choice is the right choice am if I have to stand Lord I go if I have to go huh anybody believe that will you go if you have to go by yourself amen is that right praise God you see now who made the right decision the 10 the two million or Joshua and Caleb who made the right decision can I hear y'all Joshua and Caleb made the right decision right they made the right choice isn't that right praise God so your choice the right choice the right decision you have to stand against all our positions against everybody on the job in the school in your family you have to make the right decision on Christ's Solid Rock I stand hey God amen amen yes I'm firm I'm firm with my commitment am yes Lord praise God I'm confirm you know working in the hospital I've seen surgeons that I had to work with and they didn't want to do sterile procedure just messy and you got the you contaminated the field and I'm saying but they thought because I am the surgeon I'm the Doctor Who are you I said you contaminating the field and you know who would want a a doctor that don't care about whether they contaminate that you might get an infection because of their negligence are you with me so it it's people that are in high position that contaminates the field and amen make bad decisions but just because they're in a position of headship or leadership that they can make a a bad decision that's going to contaminate it's going to be to the death of you and your soul so you better be careful that those that contaminate the word with their own thoughts and ideas those that INF infiltrate your mind with false delusions are you with me don't let them infiltrate your mind with a delusion amen the word of God stands true and it's right anyhow if you don't believe it it's still going to be right praise God oh Lord let's serve the Lord in sincerity amen 14 verse it says therefore serve the now therefore fear the lord serve him in sincerity and what and put away what God's with your father serve on the other side of the flood y'all know they were talking about a natural land and the floods we're talking about spiritual and when the other side of the flood means before we got saved amen there was things that we had to deal with people could almost be mean and nasty and uh but that's the other side of the flu people can walk in Dark Places and
