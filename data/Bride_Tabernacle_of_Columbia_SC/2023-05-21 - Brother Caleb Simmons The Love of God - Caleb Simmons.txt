every heart desired Lord move us out of the way Lord best of Pastor in his absence Lord and bless the services that are going on this morning Lord we as you come now in our mission Lord send your anointing power in Jesus name we pray amen hey man if you have your Bibles this morning we turn to the Book of Romans Romans chapter 5. amen Romans chapter 5 and we'll start at verse 6. when you got to say Amen Romans chapter 5 and verse 6. but when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly but scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet pre-adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commanded his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified in his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him amen God bless the reading of this word you may be seated amen this morning I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled the love of God the love of God and as you read here it says that said because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us as in verse 5 for when we were yet without strength and Due Time Christ died for the for the ungodly see Christ loved us so much that he went to Calvary and he died for us amen and he was so gracious and kind and I thought about this topic and when I was thinking about it I I thought about what did he give up for me I thought about what what did Jesus give up for me and I thought about would I be willing to give up what he gave up because I think about when he was in heaven he had everything he had all the riches he had all the glory he had all the honor he had people to worship Him and yet he still decided to come down to earth and die for you and me he decided to give all of that up because he loved me he loved me so much that he said you know what I'm going to go down and I'm going to have people spit on me I'm gonna have people come at me and I'm going to have them say all type of things against me but I love these people so much that I want to give I want to give my life so they don't have to give theirs I want to give them a way of escape from from the Wrath that is to come see that's the love of God that he shows he shows to us and I was just thinking about how much God loved me how much he was willing to give up for me and it says said Jesus laid down his life for the church he laid down his life for us because he loved us he laid down his life because he loved us and I think about how much love that Jesus extended but how much do I extend every day when people arise up against me how much love do I extend can I look past their faults and see that they still need a savior can I look past their faults and see that they still need to meet Jesus they still need to give their life to him and once their life has changed it'll change them it'll change how they approach me but do I have love enough to over to oversee them and say Lord I still love them Lord no matter what they did to me or what they're doing to me I can still love them no man I can Overlook them how they talk to me because I love them I can Overlook how they may demean me and may put me down because I love them and I can do what they said because the best testimony that you can live is your life people may not see what you say to they may may not hear what you say to them but they always will see what you do to them they will always will be watching they always will be looking at you and see how you react and sometimes they will come to test you they will come to test and see if you really got that love that Jesus had they will really come to test you and see if you really have what Jesus had can you overlook what I say to you can you overlook what I do to you can you still treat me the same way when I'm being mean to you when I'm saying all malicious things against you when I'm going behind your back on the job and talking about you and saying that you don't do this and you don't do that can you still treat me the same way can you still go out and say that I love you and I'm going to treat you no matter how you treat me I'm gonna treat you like Jesus treated me see that's the love that surpasses all understanding that's the love that goes beyond what we can imagine what we can think that's the love that Jesus has and he requires that from each and every one of us that's the only way that we're going to make it out of this life we're gonna make it to Heaven it's with that love that he gives to each and every one of us it's that love that goes beyond what we can see it goes beyond what we can feel it goes beyond what we can think it's that love that surpasses all understanding and that's the love that he gives into each one of us if we want it you can't get get what you don't want you can't get what you don't want and if you don't want the love of God you'll never have it you'll never be able to overcome certain things because you don't want the love that Jesus has extended to you each and every day you don't want that love see you said no I don't want what Jesus did for me I don't want the blood that he shed for me Lord I don't want to be forgiven for my sins you don't want that love but God extends it to you each and every day he gives you an opportunity to say I laid down my life for you because I loved you I laid down my life because because I love you and he said and he said if you love me then strengthen your brother you have if you love someone you do whatever you can whatever you can for them whatever they ask for you if you truly love them they ask you and you know that it's not wrong and it's not an unjust act you try to do the best that you can for them I think of a mother and how she sacrifices for her children because she loves them I think of a father because he love them he'll give you good advice he'll tell you you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do that because of he loves you you may not understand it but if he truly loves you he'll tell you the right things a mother will tell you hey son you shouldn't do this son you shouldn't hang around these people why because she loves you not because she hates your friends not because she hates your company but because she loves you she wants the best for you she said she might tell you hey don't go down this road why because she can see the end before you start she can see it before you get down that road she looking down there and say hey that road gonna lead you to trouble but you can't see it you don't have the experience that she had but because she loves you she tells you she might come grab you by the shoulder and say hey son wake up daughter wake up because you need to see what's coming before you because she loves you and see God loves you even more than that even more than the most that you can ever feel love from a person God loves you even more he said I'll never put more on you than you can bear because he loves you he loves you so much that he said I gave my life for you I made sure that you had a way of Escape I made sure that you have a way of Victory I made sure that you had a path of righteousness before you if you love me then you'll keep my Commandments that's what he said if you love me and said why do we live this life the prophet God said why do we live this life it's because we love him why do we make the sacrifices that we do is because we love them you know why do we do the things that we do is because we love them and there's nothing that can tell you there's no amount of people telling you you should do this you should do that the reason why you should do it is because you love God it's because you said Lord I love you this is why I make the sacrifices this is why I do these things this is why I come to church Lord this is why I worship you is because I love you not because someone tells me you lift your hands praise the lord it's because Lord I love you Lord I love you Lord I love you and Lord I want to give this to you Lord I want to give you the honor Lord I want to give you the praise Lord I want to give you the glory Lord because I love you there's nothing I can do there's nothing I can say but Lord I just love you I love you so much that I want to give this to you I love you so much Lord I want to give it to you see no one has to coerce you to do it no one has to convince you to do it you want to do it because you love God you want to do it because you you you gave your life to him because you love him so much and no matter how much you love them God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him see you love him so much that God said I'm going to reward you because of what you've done for me he said I'm going to give you more exceedingly abundantly more than you can ask a thing because you love God you can keep his Commandments because you love God there's certain things you won't do there's certain things places that you won't go because you love God because you love them so much and it's not because you because someone told you not to go there you just know that those are not places that the Lord would want you to go those are not things that he would want you to do those are not acts that he would want you to commit because you love him and God will speak to you because you love him and when you get so close to him God I speak to you and say don't do that don't do that don't go around them people stay home don't go around those friends stay home seek me for seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you it's because you love him you get close enough to God that God will start speaking to you he'll start coming in your room and talking to you you'll start leading you and guarding you when the more you love them the closer you'll get to him you'll want to pray you'll want to seek God you don't want to get on your knees you want to study you want to get down and say Lord I got to get the business with you because I love you and Lord I want this to grow stronger and stronger Lord like David said I want my cup to overflow Lord I want this to run over and over and it says in one song writer said the blessings running over and over see God wants she wants you to love him so much that you'll do anything for him whatever he asks you to do you'll do anything for him I think of the story I said God loves people so much and he gave us many examples even though they went through trials and tribulations it was because he loved them I thought of the scripture I said it says in the whom the Lord lovers he chastens see if a parent really love you sometimes they gotta punish you they got to show you hey that was wrong but sometimes telling you wasn't good enough they had to put a punishment on it so that you could really understand how wrong it was it wasn't because they hated you and they they didn't they was all against you and my parents always they hate me and I don't want to see it's because they loved you they loved you so much that they had to punish you so that you could truly understand what you did wrong I said many of times when many times my dad would sit me down before he would punish me and he would tell me this is why it was wrong and he would tell me because he loved me he wanted me to truly understand what I had done wrong and why it was wrong now I still got the punishment because I still needed the punishment but he would tell me because he loved me and he punished me because he loved me see that's the same way that God does when he loves you he takes you through things he takes you through trials and tribulations because he wants you to grow stronger he wants you to get stronger in him because he loves you he takes you through these trials and tribulations and he says I want you to learn these lessons I want you to learn them and sometimes it's not even for you it's so that God can get Glory and so that God they asked the question of the the man that was blind the time they said was it his sin or his parents sin he said neither it was for me to get Glory and see because God loved him so much he wanted to show forth his power he wanted to show forth his might he wanted to show for his glory through this through this testimony and say each one of us have a testimony each one of us we we know where God has brought us from and even if we don't know where it's going to end up we know where God has brought us from said on the saying is someone said that I'm not who I used to be uh not where I used to be I'm not where I want to be but I'm right where God placed me to be say even though because God knows what you need when you need it God knows how much you need when you need it and he knows how to take things off of you when you need it but he says come to me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn to me for our meek and lowly in heart and say he shall give rest for your soul because he loved you he said I'll take your burdens because he loves you he said come and give them to me and I'll carry these loads because he loved you he said I'll I'll help you through what you're going through because he loved you he said I'm going to give you strength to overcome I'm going to give you power to speak the word and these things may happen for you I'm going to give you the the power that I had to create worlds because I loved you because I love you now do you love him in the same way he loves you that's the question I asked do you love God in the same way that he loves you and I asked what sacrifices are you making because he made a great sacrifice for you and I he came down to earth and he said I'm going to take these beatings these whippings these thorns on my head people sticking Spears in my side I'm gonna take this with you now what are you sacrificing do you love them enough to sacrifice something for him do you love him enough to give up something for him do you love him enough to do what he asks you to do it's not a hard life that God gives you it's not a hard thing that he may ask you to do don't do this and he makes it very plain and very clear he he may and he says don't do this and all you have to do is not do it and he said I'll bless you all you have to do is obey his word and he said I'll bless you and the blessings of God is better than any blessings you can ever have you may think someone give you this or give you that but when God blesses you nobody can question the things that God does for you in your life and it's because he loves you that He blesses you it's because he loves you and you love him is why you give up certain things you may give up drinking you may give up smoking but God takes those desires from you because he loves you and you love him you may give up certain things and you may say well this is what puts me in my crowds but what if you lose your crowds God still loves you what if you lose your friends God still loves you what if you lose your parents God still loves you what if you lose your sister and your brother God still loves you when all of those are gone you can always get down on your knees and talk to God say Lord I need you to come by and visit me why because Lord I need to feel that love that love is greater than any feeling that anyone can give you is greater than the love of a parent it's greater than the love of a friend it's greater than the love of a husband and a wife it's the love of God that come that comes and surpasses all understanding but I asked the question do we take advantage of the love of God do we truly take advantage of the love of God that he gives us I said I think of the prodigal son and he chose to get his inheritance early but one day he came to his senses and realized that he had a father that loved him he had a father that loved him he said you know I'm about to eat what the pigs eat but in my father's house they got fooled they got good food and water and good drinks and all this because there was a famine in the land and he got to realizing how much his father loved loved him he Maybe started to think about you know maybe I shouldn't have ran away from home so early maybe I should have stayed he might have thought about his brother who was still there with his father who was still there working continually because he loved his father he said I wanted to get out and do my own thing but where did I lead me where did that lead me when I want to do my whole thing maybe he he might not have realized that when he wanted to do his own thing he left that love behind he left that safety behind there was something that was keeping him it was because his father loved him that he kept him close it was because his father loved him that he had him working he had them doing these things it was because his father loved him but he said I I want to give that up I want to go and do my own thing well he got out there and he did his own thing and he lost all his money he lost all his friends and he realized maybe when he lost his money he didn't have friends maybe he lost his money and he realized hey these friends was only around for what I could give these friends was only around because of what I was doing for them these friends were only around because what I could give them the status maybe the fun times the good times the highs that's all they was around here for where are my real friends when I'm down and out where are my real friends when who are the ones that truly love me when I'm when I don't have nobody when I'm out here working on a farm and in the pig pen where they at now where are they now ask who loves me now but he remembered his father's love he might have remembered his brother and said you know I know that my father still loves me and if I go home right now my father will welcome me amen after all that he had done he realized that a Father's Love had surpassed all that he had done all that he had done all the sin and all the things that he had done that might have been wrong he knew when he walked home to his father his father would welcome him but when he came home he was he had a he had a repentant heart because he realized what he had done he he was saying I'm sorry Dad I'm sorry Father for what I did I'm sorry for leaving you the way that I did Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for going and doing what I wanted to do he came with a repentant heart and his father welcomed him saw him a far off until prepare the fatty care prepare A Feast for him because my son is coming home and that's the same way God wants to see you he says come home come home because I love you there's so many things I'm keeping and protecting you from because I love you if you love God and you give your life to him God will protect you from things because he loves you as the devil went to God and for job and he said Lord the only reason he he loves you is because you protecting them you got to hedge around them and only if if you let me take these things from him let's see if he really loves you let's see if I take his if I take his cattle if I take his wealth if I take his money if I take let me see I'll take his family from him I cause his wife to turn against them and let's see if he truly love you I'll give him sicknesses and diseases and let's see if he truly loves you the only reason he loves you is because he protecting you and God said you know he knew Job see God knew how much job loved him God knew what was deep down in the inside that maybe you and I cannot see he knew what was deep down greater than any of us could reach he knew what was inside of job he knew how much job loved him and he said and he said you know what I'll let you do everything you want to him just don't take his life just don't take his life so the devil he went out and he said I'm gonna I'm gonna start with this I'm gonna take take his camels and once and I'm gonna slay all his servants but one to let them hear the news you know sometimes you have he may have so much you have so many things and if you misplace one thing you don't you don't worry about it you say I can get something else you get something else but the devil allows someone to come back and tell him what you lost it's different it's different when you don't know about it but the devil allowed him to let him know about it and then he said you know what I'm gonna take his cows and then he let one servant live and come back and tell him about it he and then and then he then he killed his children he let one serpent come back and tell him hey your kid's dead and just imagine how much was on job how much was on job in that moment how much was on show depression the anxiety the depression that Joe Bona went through but yet he held on to God yet he said Lord I love you Lord though they slay me yet I'll Trust You Lord you can take everything from me but yeah I'm still Gonna Love You Lord I'm still going to trust you see job had so much on him and he and he turned and he said he said you know what even when his wife said you should curse your God and die just imagine the person that said that they love you love you more than anyone else the closest person to you said you need to curse your God and just go ahead and die and job said no I still love God more than that Joel friends came against and I said I don't know why you serving that God look what he did to you but because job loved God he didn't listen to any of that he didn't listen to anything that anybody said and after the devil got done he he realized you know this is a true one that loved God this someone that that I can't I took everything I could from him and he still loved God God said are you finished yet and the devil said I ain't got nothing else to do did everything I could do and he still loves you that's a true one that loves you right there how many of us could go through tests like that how many of us could go through half of what Joe went through a quarter what Joe went through and not turned your back on God do you love him that much do you love him that much that you can say Lord Lord if you give me a little testing trial I'm not going to turn around Lord if you give me this sickness I'm still not going to turn around because you said you're the god that healeth Lord you said by your stripes I am healed so Lord even if I'm sick Lord I still love you enough to not turn it around I still love you enough to trust that you working all this to my good I still love you enough the Lord You're gonna bring me out Lord I know that you're going to deliver me Lord I know you're going to take me through because I love you even if I can't understand why Lord I still love you Lord I still will trust you see job trust in them enough to keep going despite of what everyone was saying around them job loved them enough to keep going when no one else would would would uplift them or hold them up he had to trust in the love that he had in God and do you know if the story continues that God gave him double what he lost because he loved God God loved him so much he said you know I know the end from the beginning and I'm only giving him what he can bear because he said I can't put more on you than you can bear and God knew what job could bear God knew that even though though you slayed me yet I'll trust you because I love you Lord Lord I love you so much that I can keep going and I can keep going and I can still give you the glory Lord I can still give you the praise Lord you take this from me Lord I still love you Lord you take my child Lord I still love you Lord you take my friends Lord I still love you Lord you take this one from me I still love you Lord you take this from me and I still love you God because you still been good no matter what I'm going through no matter what I've been through God you still been good so I can still love you it'll cost me to increase my love for you it'll cause me to grow stronger in you see that's the love that he that he has for me I think of just a small thing of what is sacrificed for me he came from Heaven he didn't have to do that and even when he got to Earth he still didn't have to die he could have came to Earth and saw him like you know what these people are too Wicked I'm gonna just destroy them but he still didn't do that he still went to Calvary he still went to that cross he still shattered his blood he still went down and he went in that grave he went down to Hell defeated the devil came back up and rose again all because he loved me all because even though he knew that I would have my sins and my situations he still loved me he still died and he still shattered his blood because he loved me and when you realize how much God has done for you when you realize all the things that he sacrificed for you all you can do is say Lord I Thank You Lord I have no problem serving you Lord I have no problem giving my life to you Lord I have no problem giving you the glory giving you the praise when I walk into your house I can give Thanksgiving when I walk into your house I can give you the praise Lord because I love you Lord you've been that good to me Lord you woke me up this morning Lord you started me on my way you put food in my refrigerator clothes on my back you gave me a place to lay my head and Lord I can still thank you Lord I got limbs in my body I got hands to praise you Lord I got a mouth that I can open and say thank you Lord because I love you Jesus Lord I can lift my hands and say thank you Jesus because you've been good to me might not have been good to nobody else but you've been good to me Lord because I love you Jesus Lord I love you more than anyone can ever ask me to Lord name people may not understand what you'd have been through they might not understand your testimony but when you realize how much God loves you and he still brought you through he still kept you he still put his heads around you he still blessed you even then you're wrong sometimes God let it come down and show you that I'm still here he let you see that I'm still here I'm still right here with you I'm still love you I still got my arms wrapped around you and said I'll still keep you from anything that's coming against you that's the god that loves you that's the god that wakes you up every morning that's a God to put breath in your body that's the god that make sure that you keep living that's a God that can open eyes that's the god that heals that's the god that delivers that's the god that saves you from your sin that's the god that loves you and when you love him it surpasses everything it surpasses no one may not understand why you love God when no one might not understand because of what he brought you through I can't tell your testimony but I got my own I know where God has brought me from I know what God has brought me through I know what God has taken me through and I can't turn around now I can't go back from Once I came because God's been too good to me God been too good to me we were listening yesterday about some of the testimonies that some of the brothers had and some of the sisters had of how good God has meant to him and think about all the things he brought you through because he loves you because he loved you he gave his life for you and he gave you an opportunity this morning to say Lord I want you to repent of my sins and give my life to you and if you and if and if you walked away from God he gave you a way to come back to him say Lord I want to give you everything that you gave to me because Lord that's just a small small spot part of what you gave for me see he sacrificed so much and he asked us for so little he sacrificed so much that he asked us for so little we think about our life and we say man I only got a shorts man to live and I want to do my thing see that see that prodigal son he thought the same thing said I I only got this much time and I want to get my inheritance and do what I want to do but when he got done he realized he was left with nothing he realized that what it was only for a season his pleasure was only for a season and he started thinking about that father that loved him he started thinking about that father that loved him and that father that would do anything for him because he was his son that father that would give anything for him because he was as he was his son and he said you know I got to go back to my father's house I'm going to return to my father's house and when he came he said father forgive me forgive me for my wrong forgive me for what I've done and said I'm coming back because I know that you love me I know that you love me no matter what I've done you I know that you love me and Lord you're going to forgive me for what I've done and you're going to take me in now when he got back don't be like the brother he got back and went to the father and he's like why are you welcoming him back I've been here all this time and I ain't got what he got and the father turned to him and he said do you not understand all that I have is yours all that I have is yours and that's what God wants to give you so he can turn to you and say all that I have is yours all that I have is yours and he asks that you give your life to him that he may do what he wants to do with your life Amen Let Us bow Lord Jesus Lord we learned about your love Lord and we asked it Lord we got to see how that you went to Calvary and you shared your life for me you shared your life for us and Lord your sacrifice so much Lord there's so much that you've done for us and Lord we can't even tell it all we can't even give you all the glory and all the praise David said if I had ten thousand tongues it wouldn't be enough to give you the glory in all the praise Lord if there's someone here this morning that doesn't know you Lord we ask that you come and you come down into their life Lord if you want to know him this morning every head bowed and every eye closed just lift your hands if you want to give your life to the Lord just lift your hands
