[35:57] The book of Hebrews 10th chapter.
[36:04] Amen.
[36:05] [Music]
[36:15] Hebrews 10.
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] I want to start at the 19th verse.
[36:28] Having therefore, brethren, boldness
[36:32] to enter into the holiness,
[36:35] holiest
[36:37] by the blood of Jesus,
[36:39] by a new and living way,
[36:44] which he hath consecrated for us,
[36:49] excuse me, through the veil, that is to
[36:53] say, his flesh, and having in high
[36:57] priest over the House of God,
[37:00] let us draw near with a true heart in
[37:04] full assurance of faith, having our
[37:07] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[37:11] and our bodies washed with pure water.
[37:14] Let us pray. Father, we thank you, oh
[37:17] God, for your word, Lord. May you bless
[37:19] it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[37:25] Amen. Appreciate the Lord tonight.
[37:33] I want to try this for a few minutes
[37:36] tonight
[37:38] to talk to you on a little thought of a
[37:40] consecrated life
[37:43] Jesus. A consecrated life.
[37:48] If you notice here in the scripture,
[37:53] it says 20th verse, by a new and living
[37:56] way
[37:58] which he hath
[38:01] consecrated for us.
[38:04] In other words, he made it possible
[38:10] that we also can have
[38:14] a consecrated life. What does a
[38:16] consecrated life means?
[38:21] It says here to
[38:24] to live a consecrated life means to
[38:28] dedicate oneself to God
[38:32] and just the point I real and live
[38:37] in a way that glorifies him. Amen.
[38:44] Not just to dedicate yourself, but it's
[38:48] a setting yourself apart.
[38:55] We have so much to contend with in this
[38:59] generation,
[39:02] so many pulls.
[39:06] And everything is really out just to
[39:09] pull you away from what's the real
[39:12] thing. Amen.
[39:15] And brother Ernest a lot of time
[39:16] distractions.
[39:21] Not that what we are doing is not
[39:23] important but it's not important than
[39:26] God.
[39:30] We say a lot of time that you know we
[39:33] want God to be first.
[39:37] But in our everyday living and our
[39:40] action, we can see that he's not really
[39:43] first.
[39:44] [Music]
[39:46] And the Bible plenty teller, he says,
[39:48] "Seek ye
[39:50] first."
[39:53] The kingdom of God.
[39:56] In other words, nothing else shall be
[39:59] before God to you, not as individual.
[40:05] Now I notice this that when God is
[40:08] calling for this kind of life,
[40:12] I guess I can probably say it like it
[40:14] did in Revelation. He who hath a ear,
[40:17] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[40:19] to the churches.
[40:25] God have to do something in
[40:30] me and your life. Yes, Jesus. And sister
[40:34] sing song. I feel the pull.
[40:39] I believe that as late as it is, we all
[40:42] ought to be feeling the pull that Lord,
[40:44] I got to get close to you.
[40:46] Amen. Bless.
[40:50] We looking and seeing current events
[40:53] mean clear through prophecy.
[40:57] We are seeing the very Bible unfolding
[41:00] man. uh
[41:03] declaring the thing that was broke. Now
[41:05] we living in a day that we seen it
[41:07] coming to pass.
[41:10] And I believe that to us as belie as as
[41:14] Christians,
[41:16] it ought to make us tighten up.
[41:23] It ought to be a pull on us that hey, we
[41:26] see that, you know, it's nearer than we
[41:30] ever thought.
[41:34] We already talked about it's soon and
[41:36] soon, but soon and very soon we're going
[41:39] to see the king. But it ought to cause
[41:41] us now to really get more serious
[41:48] about our own life. Each individual
[41:52] ought to be a little more concerned
[41:54] about your walk with God. Where are we
[41:56] at? Amen. Go ahead.
[42:02] And we see in our lives, we see things
[42:04] ling.
[42:07] We see that the world seem to be
[42:10] consuming us.
[42:13] I mean, the Bible say one place say that
[42:15] cares of this life will choke the very
[42:17] life of God out of you. Amen.
[42:20] But it all depends on whom you yield
[42:24] yourself to.
[42:27] The Bible said another place says set
[42:29] your affections on things where
[42:33] that's what our mind ought to be
[42:35] sinning. Now whatever we doing we going
[42:37] to keep doing that but my affection is
[42:40] on things above. I'm not looking for
[42:43] this here here. No, I'm looking up.
[42:51] what I have here and what I don't have
[42:53] here. Okay, it's all right.
[43:00] But I don't want to miss the song said,
[43:02] "Whatever you're doing, Lord, in this
[43:04] season, don't do it without me." Amen.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:08] I don't want to get so wrapped up into
[43:12] what this world has going on to where I
[43:15] miss
[43:18] what God is doing in our season.
[43:22] Lord help us.
[43:26] We are in we say a crucial hour a hour
[43:30] where we ought to be desperate.
[43:36] We got enough just in our own lives, in
[43:40] our own family
[43:42] that ought to throw us on the altar.
[43:45] Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:48] It ought to keep us
[43:50] on our knees and on our faces and
[43:54] fastening and crying out
[43:58] because you know physically there are
[43:59] thing going on around us and with us
[44:01] that we can't do nothing about.
[44:04] Go ahead. It's going to take God to do
[44:09] these things. Amen.
[44:13] But we must begin to cry out, "Lord,
[44:17] here I am." Amen.
[44:26] It's not just enough anymore
[44:31] for us just to come to church and sing a
[44:34] song and those things look good and
[44:37] whatever we do. But it got to be
[44:38] something we doing at home
[44:43] cuz whatever we're doing home, we
[44:45] bringing it here.
[44:48] And if you ain't doing nothing out
[44:49] there, you ain't going to be doing
[44:51] nothing in here. Come on now.
[44:56] I don't know about you, but you our
[44:57] hearts ought to be stirred.
[45:06] A lot of time you know we look for uh a
[45:09] group
[45:13] you know to that we can do it as a group
[45:17] but God is calling individuals
[45:24] and you must hear that call.
[45:29] Every individual that's a Christian
[45:31] ought to hear the urgency that it's
[45:35] later than you think. Amen. Amen.
[45:39] So God said, "We done played the church
[45:45] and we done played religious,
[45:50] but we have got to get a hold of God.
[45:53] It's urgent." Amen.
[45:57] Zab is telling me, man, it's going to
[45:59] take more than just what we have been
[46:01] doing.
[46:04] We up against some demonic powers,
[46:11] even when it come to the church world,
[46:16] demonic influences.
[46:20] I like that definition because it said
[46:21] that we ought to be living in such a way
[46:25] that it pleases God. That's true. Amen.
[46:29] Not just talking about the things you
[46:32] know
[46:34] that brother Brandham taught us, but
[46:36] there ought to be a life
[46:39] that we are living before the people and
[46:43] they see that that life is on display.
[46:47] Amen.
[46:49] They see that there's somebody that is
[46:51] getting along somewhere with God and
[46:54] they they're turning down all the
[46:56] worldly thing, but they realize that,
[46:59] you know, I have got to do it.
[47:05] And I'll say this, if you ain't doing
[47:07] nothing, you ain't going to get nothing.
[47:10] Amen.
[47:13] A lot of time we always we always put it
[47:15] on well it ought to be the pastor doing
[47:17] it and we don't have to consecrate it.
[47:19] That's not true
[47:23] because if he's consecrated and you are
[47:26] not you can't even receive what he is
[47:28] saying.
[47:30] Amen.
[47:32] But if we all, you know, if we can just
[47:34] get our minds in a place that this and
[47:38] whatever we doing, let's take care of
[47:39] it. But I must get a hold of God.
[47:44] We can't wait around anymore for this
[47:47] picture to come or that to happen or
[47:49] this. No, you have your own personal
[47:52] meeting with God
[47:55] in your own closet. You meet with God in
[47:58] that closet.
[48:00] Bless him.
[48:02] in a personal relationship.
[48:08] The problem we having is the life that
[48:11] we are living
[48:13] is not matching what we are talking
[48:16] about.
[48:20] the terminologies that we didn't
[48:24] know them so well,
[48:26] you know, because they are quotations
[48:30] that the prophet of God spoke about
[48:33] and everybody's always talking about,
[48:36] you know, and reading. Nothing wrong
[48:38] with those thing to read those thing and
[48:40] talk about it but there ought to be some
[48:42] kind of manifestation in our lives
[48:47] because see you are talking about
[48:49] something that has been
[48:53] and it's like God ain't doing nothing
[48:55] now with nobody
[48:58] replaced on what brother Bon said
[49:00] brother Bon did yes but he said now he
[49:03] said after I'm gone
[49:07] he said that the ministry is going to
[49:09] take these things that I've spoken to
[49:11] you and they by inspir they're going to
[49:13] preach these things to the people.
[49:17] In other words, the very things he has
[49:19] given us and when the ministers get it
[49:21] by inspiration, he gives it to the
[49:24] people and it ought to cause a change in
[49:27] us.
[49:29] The word being preached ought to have a
[49:32] change uh in effect. Amen.
[49:37] that when we see God speaking to our
[49:39] condition, then we'll understand, hey, I
[49:42] got to really get a hold of God in this
[49:44] area.
[49:49] And as a whole, I'm talking about
[49:50] worldwide basically or how you want to
[49:53] put it. We did get a little excited for
[49:56] a little while,
[49:58] but then after a few days, we right back
[50:01] to the same corner.
[50:05] We need something to happen. Amen.
[50:11] And let me tell you something. If you
[50:12] don't cry out for God,
[50:16] if you don't have a hunger and a thirst,
[50:19] you know, to uh get closer to God
[50:23] yourself.
[50:26] One place he said he said that we
[50:29] shouldn't be in the predicament that we
[50:31] in
[50:34] the laidback and the unconcerned that we
[50:38] have gotten to that the lay of the seal
[50:41] of spirit doesn't captivate us
[50:45] and now it's molding us to to take it
[50:48] easy.
[50:51] You're going to be all right. You will
[50:52] catch up.
[50:55] Let me tell you something. Don't you
[50:56] believe that?
[50:59] I believe we ought to be pinching
[51:01] ourselves.
[51:05] The Bible say, "Examine your own
[51:07] selves."
[51:09] You ought to know where you at in your
[51:12] experience with God.
[51:14] You ought to be seeing spiritual growth.
[51:23] We ought to be seeing dynamics.
[51:28] The power of God ought to be so
[51:31] activated in our lives.
[51:40] Samson said, "Lord, once more,
[51:47] Lord, help us.
[51:49] Help
[51:51] us to get more consecrated.
[51:55] Help us to be more dedicated. Help me
[51:59] not to be so loose.
[52:05] We just do anything nowadays.
[52:10] We're not even conscious that God wants
[52:13] to deal with you.
[52:17] When he called you, he didn't call you
[52:19] just to be calling you.
[52:22] When he called Samson, he calls it as a
[52:25] Nazerite vow.
[52:28] Amen.
[52:30] And what Samson did? He started playing
[52:33] around
[52:36] and he played around and played around
[52:41] with women type of the church. Play
[52:43] around with churches.
[52:46] Lord help
[52:49] until he met Dealila
[52:56] and she was commissioned to find out
[52:59] where Samson scrimp is at.
[53:04] And I mean that's what the devil done
[53:06] to, you know, I'm not saying I say us on
[53:08] top of all over.
[53:11] He found out where a script is at.
[53:19] We are glad just to be in a message,
[53:24] but that message ought to be producing a
[53:27] powerhouse life. Amen. Agree.
[53:33] We've gotten to the place we don't even
[53:36] think about witnessing no more.
[53:40] I tell her be married. I said
[53:43] God didn't save us just to be confined
[53:47] to buildings.
[53:53] Everybody want a pull pit. Everybody
[53:55] want a spotlight position. Everybody
[53:57] want to do this. But nobody want to get
[54:00] yourself in a place that you can go out
[54:03] into the hedges.
[54:06] Go ahead.
[54:09] that God can begin to lead to you. Go
[54:11] there
[54:14] and God will put people
[54:17] in your pathway.
[54:22] But we got to have something that they
[54:25] want.
[54:31] And the people know when you got
[54:33] something. That's true. Amen. your very
[54:36] life, that presence, you know, that you
[54:38] living in and you bathing in, they know
[54:41] that you got something.
[54:46] Mom, me and Peter was going to the
[54:48] prayer. That man
[54:50] at the gate begging and Peter told him,
[54:52] "Look on us."
[54:56] They know they had something.
[54:59] He wanted money, but they had something
[55:01] greater that money couldn't buy. Amen.
[55:07] You see the Bible say the man was
[55:08] expecting
[55:11] to receive something
[55:15] and the people are expecting
[55:18] to receive something. They wonder where
[55:21] are the people at
[55:29] you know I was thinking I said you know
[55:31] when much has been given to us and then
[55:33] there's much required true amen
[55:37] don't you know that when God gives us we
[55:41] these thing this word he gave us you
[55:44] know then he requiring more
[55:48] out of us
[55:52] because we have something that the world
[55:55] basically don't know anything about.
[56:00] I'm not just talking about a a letter
[56:03] form, but I'm talking about, you know, a
[56:05] very manifestation of God in our lives.
[56:10] Come on now.
[56:14] Where is the power and manifestation of
[56:17] God in this hour?
[56:23] Sometime you wondering things people
[56:25] think God weak
[56:28] that the thing that he said he'll do
[56:30] that he don't do it no more and I hear
[56:33] people say that God don't do these
[56:34] things no more God don't you when when
[56:36] did he stop
[56:40] so God said God takes his man but not
[56:42] the spirit
[56:45] and that was the spirit of Christ.
[56:50] And so if Christ is here,
[56:53] then those same thing ought to be going
[56:56] on. Amen.
[57:00] They ought to be going on in our local
[57:02] assemblies.
[57:04] They ought to be going in your everyday
[57:06] life. Amen.
[57:12] But because that we not consecrated
[57:14] enough. Amen. People
[57:19] are
[57:23] losing their minds and done something
[57:26] gave up hope
[57:33] because they don't see any
[57:37] demonstration of the power of God.
[57:42] And it's like that we done taught it
[57:44] away
[57:48] or we done g people so much intellectual
[57:52] speakers
[57:55] and we done took the power of God away
[57:57] from the people.
[58:01] They don't no longer see the
[58:03] supernatural
[58:07] but yet it's still here.
[58:14] But until we as people of God
[58:19] by now we ought to understand what the
[58:21] ministry really is all about. It's not
[58:24] to just make us uh intellectual giant or
[58:27] smart people.
[58:29] But God want to produce a life in us a
[58:34] consecrated life.
[58:37] a life that God can be well pleased
[58:41] with. Amen. And if God isn't pleased,
[58:45] then what are we doing?
[58:52] Lord, help us.
[58:57] They had us say, "Lord, take me back."
[59:05] Because there,
[59:07] you know, it used to be I don't even
[59:10] want to talk like that
[59:14] cuz I know God is still doing those
[59:16] things.
[59:18] Yes, sir.
[59:21] But it takes a people that is
[59:23] understanding what the ministry is all
[59:26] about
[59:27] and they have caught the vision
[59:31] cuz he could without a vision the people
[59:33] are perish.
[59:38] We ought to know what God want done with
[59:40] this word that he gave us. True. Amen.
[59:44] We are supposed to be the people that is
[59:47] supposed to be
[59:50] taking this gospel
[59:53] to everyone that we come in contact with
[59:58] and telling them, "Come see a man."
[1:00:02] I'm talking about Jesus Christ.
[1:00:06] Come see a man that can tell you all
[1:00:10] your things.
[1:00:13] Come see a man that that can change your
[1:00:16] very life.
[1:00:18] Even at your lowest state that you in,
[1:00:21] God can turn it all around. Amen.
[1:00:29] A lot of what he said is it won't rain
[1:00:31] until I call for it. Let me tell you
[1:00:34] something. You ain't going to get
[1:00:36] nothing from God until you call for it.
[1:00:40] You got the call for it.
[1:00:44] The pastor's calling for it, but you got
[1:00:48] to call for it. It must be personal.
[1:00:52] It must be a a a individual affair
[1:00:56] between you and your God. Amen.
[1:01:02] Cuz we don't know what's going to happen
[1:01:04] next. I'm not supposed to worry about
[1:01:07] that. But I know what God is doing.
[1:01:10] I know the place that he has been taking
[1:01:13] us and trying to get us to. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:19] That's why he sent this word to prepare
[1:01:22] us for what's coming. Amen. Amen. But
[1:01:25] you can't be prepared if you ain't
[1:01:27] studying.
[1:01:30] We not praying. We not consecrating our
[1:01:33] life. We have to wait till somebody tell
[1:01:35] us to do it.
[1:01:37] when it ought to be the Holy Ghost put
[1:01:39] you on a fast. Amen.
[1:01:44] The Holy Ghost ought to be leading you.
[1:01:46] Hey, separate yourself. Come on now.
[1:01:49] Amen. Spend some time with me. That's
[1:01:53] what God want.
[1:01:55] You give everybody else their time, but
[1:01:58] you won't give me my time. Amen.
[1:02:02] You give your job. You give your
[1:02:03] shopping. You give your children. You
[1:02:05] get your wife, but you won't give God
[1:02:07] the time. Amen. And he ought to be the
[1:02:11] most important thing to you. Cuz without
[1:02:14] him, you can't do nothing.
[1:02:18] That's right.
[1:02:20] He's the one that wake you up.
[1:02:23] He's the one that gives you the strength
[1:02:24] in that body to be able to go and do
[1:02:27] those things you do. It's because of
[1:02:28] him.
[1:02:32] Maybe we not aware of that yet. It's all
[1:02:34] because of him.
[1:02:36] Nothing of your good effort. Not that
[1:02:38] you so good, not that he got to do it,
[1:02:40] but that's God grace.
[1:02:43] Amen. And if God have enough grace on us
[1:02:46] to allow us to do this thing, how much
[1:02:49] more we ought to be on fire for him.
[1:02:53] Amen.
[1:02:55] What happened to our time? Something has
[1:02:58] consumed it. Yes,
[1:03:03] something has as I say something have
[1:03:05] consumed the time that the people is too
[1:03:08] busy now.
[1:03:10] They have increased with goods.
[1:03:15] They liking nothing.
[1:03:18] Gain gain gain.
[1:03:21] Get get nothing wrong with that.
[1:03:26] As long as God is first. Amen.
[1:03:30] The top of your chart ought to be
[1:03:32] everything you do, God first. Amen.
[1:03:36] Career, God first. Amen. Your job, God
[1:03:39] first.
[1:03:45] And if he's not first,
[1:03:49] there's a reason a lot of time that the
[1:03:51] results we get don't come out correctly.
[1:03:54] And we have sparks, but we need fire.
[1:03:57] Amen.
[1:04:00] Spark is a sign that fire, you know, can
[1:04:03] happen.
[1:04:05] But you can't have sparks all the time
[1:04:07] and no fire never come from it.
[1:04:12] I'm going to read one thing. I'm going
[1:04:13] to close.
[1:04:16] And God through his mercy has washed us
[1:04:20] and separated us by the washing of the
[1:04:23] word by the waters and separate his
[1:04:26] church from the things of the world unto
[1:04:29] a separated consecrated life to live for
[1:04:33] him walking in his present world without
[1:04:36] condemnation.
[1:04:38] There is therefore now no condemnation
[1:04:40] to them that are in Christ through
[1:04:42] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[1:04:45] flesh but been separated by the water
[1:04:48] through the word.
[1:04:51] That's what he's calling his church for
[1:04:55] to separate them from the world. They
[1:04:57] got to be a difference. Amen. Amen. They
[1:05:01] got to be between us and the world.
[1:05:03] Amen.
[1:05:05] And I told me man I tell I'm not talking
[1:05:07] about our long dresses either.
[1:05:12] I talking about our hair not being cut
[1:05:14] and those things are all right to do but
[1:05:16] that's not what I'm talking it must be
[1:05:18] more than clothes.
[1:05:22] It ought to be a manifestation.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:26] That we are so anointed by the spirit of
[1:05:29] God that when the devil even see you
[1:05:31] that he has to run. Come on now. Amen.
[1:05:34] He can't stay in your presence. Amen.
[1:05:38] I mean was they Peter them name that
[1:05:41] they said the shadow
[1:05:44] Peter don't shadow
[1:05:48] casting out devil.
[1:05:51] Why? Because it was the presence of God
[1:05:54] with them. Amen. And so God always he
[1:05:58] said if you want to know what our church
[1:06:00] ought to be like he said read the book
[1:06:02] of acts
[1:06:06] cuz we ought to be a duplicate
[1:06:10] in some. Amen. He didn't have the
[1:06:14] fullness of the word like we got it. The
[1:06:17] more the word God released then the
[1:06:19] power of God come with it. Amen. If we
[1:06:23] preach it and teach it in the right
[1:06:25] context, we'll get the right results,
[1:06:29] not mixing it with some man-made idea
[1:06:32] and upholding some other person in Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ. If we preach Jesus Christ to the
[1:06:38] person, we're getting Jesus Christ on
[1:06:41] the scene. Amen. Amen. But you preach a
[1:06:44] man, you get a man. Amen.
[1:06:49] Sir,
[1:06:51] we would see Jesus. Amen. That's what we
[1:06:55] ought to be seeing. Amen. When you come
[1:06:57] to church, you ought to not leave until
[1:07:00] Jesus come in your presence.
[1:07:03] Cuz we got needs. Amen. Right now, all
[1:07:07] of us got need things in our lives,
[1:07:09] things that nobody else can do but God.
[1:07:12] Amen. Amen. And if God is the only one
[1:07:15] can do it, then let's cry out Lord here
[1:07:19] I am tonight. Amen. Amen. Come on. God
[1:07:22] know the deep things in your heart.
[1:07:26] Those thing that nobody else know about.
[1:07:28] God said I I heard your prayer. I know
[1:07:31] what's in your heart and here I am to do
[1:07:34] it.
[1:07:38] What are we pulling for?
[1:07:43] We ought to be pulling for God.
[1:07:48] Come on, brother S.
[1:07:51] That's my desire. Lord,
[1:07:54] give us that consecrated life. Not just
[1:07:57] on Sunday, not just on Friday, but Lord,
[1:08:01] let me just live in your presence,
[1:08:05] God. that you know it's time you know
[1:08:06] you wake up I don't know about you you
[1:08:08] wake up in the morning time and even
[1:08:10] before you open your mouth just that
[1:08:13] presence of God just be so
[1:08:17] imminent
[1:08:19] to you
[1:08:23] and but when that present isn't there
[1:08:25] you feel bad
[1:08:28] you feel dry
[1:08:31] you start feeling that am I say what
[1:08:34] happen.
[1:08:36] You need a consecration.
[1:08:40] You need to call for it.
[1:08:43] Lord, anoint me aresh again. Amen.
[1:08:48] Rededicate my life, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:53] God bless you.
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:03] Praise God. Amen. How many you want it?
[1:09:06] Amen. A consecrated life.
[1:09:09] Amen.
[1:09:11] Consecrate me, Lord, for thy service,
[1:09:15] Lord. That's what we want, a consecrated
[1:09:18] life.
[1:09:22] We know Israel just bombed Iran and
[1:09:28] it could be
[1:09:31] we we're inching and getting closer and
[1:09:33] closer to the third world war.
[1:09:38] And if it's a world war, that means it
[1:09:40] affect every country in the world.
[1:09:45] And if it does,
[1:09:47] we should be out of here. The rapture
[1:09:50] should have taken place
[1:09:52] before the bombs hit America.
[1:09:56] The bride ought to be gone.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:00] Are you looking to be gone?
[1:10:03] Are you looking to still be around here?
[1:10:07] Because the way things are going,
[1:10:10] it won't be long. Amen. And we'll be
[1:10:14] leaving here.
[1:10:16] Okay, sister. It won't be long.
[1:10:20] It won't be long
[1:10:31] here.
[1:10:35] It won't be long.
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:42] We'll be going home.
[1:10:49] It won't be long.
