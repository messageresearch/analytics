[30:38] you for allowing us to be here, giving
[30:40] us safe travels down the dangerous
[30:41] highways, Lord, keeping us in the name
[30:43] of the Lord Jesus. We ask you to forgive
[30:45] our sins, Lord, transgressions, the
[30:47] iniquities, shortcomings, anything your
[30:48] presence, Father, your anointing. Again,
[30:50] we thank you for the pastor of this
[30:51] assembly, Brother Henry Simmons. Lord,
[30:53] allow us to stand here this morning to

[30:56] congregation. We ask you to bless us
[30:58] now, God. We commit all things in your

[31:02] you the praise, honor, and glory in

[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want you to turn us
[31:08] to the book of Corinthians.
[31:10] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:14] Book of 2 Corinthians
[31:16] [Music]
[31:19] the 10th chapter.
[31:30] And we begin at the fourth verse. If you
[31:33] got it, say, "Amen."
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. For the weapons
[31:36] of our warfare are not carnal, but
[31:39] mighty through God to the pulling down
[31:41] of strongholds. We got weapons. Praise
[31:43] the Lord. We got tools we can use to
[31:45] defeat the enemy. Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Weapons of our warfare are not carnal.
[31:49] We don't fight like we used to fight
[31:51] when we've been in the world with fists
[31:52] and stuff like that. No, we got
[31:54] different. We got spiritual weapons now.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; But mighty through God to the pulling
[31:58] down what? Strongholds. Amen. Anything
[32:01] that's trying to bind us. Casting down
[32:03] imagination and every high thing that
[32:05] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[32:07] God and bringing into captivity every
[32:10] thought to the obedience of Christ. You
[32:13] want to bring everything down into
[32:14] obedience. Amen. and having a readiness
[32:18] to revenge all disobedience. We want to
[32:21] get rid of every disobedience.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; When your obedience is fulfilled. Amen.
[32:26] Let us pray. Gracious kind heavenly
[32:28] father, we have read your word. Now,
[32:30] God, you just have your way. Bless the
[32:32] people, father, in Jesus Christ's name.
[32:34] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. From the
[32:37] reading of those uh scriptures, they
[32:39] won't take the topic coming into
[32:41] obedience.
[32:42] Coming into obedience. We understand
[32:46] that all the trouble is in the world
[32:48] today is because of disobedience.
[32:51] Somebody disobeyed.
[32:54] All the trouble we see going on in our
[32:55] lives is because of disobedience. We
[32:58] don't want to obey. But God wants us to
[33:01] come into obedience. He want us to be
[33:03] obedient to his word.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And that what God purposes and
[33:06] everything that we do for God and inside
[33:09] the kingdom of God is to bring us into
[33:11] obedience. So, we want to be ready, as
[33:13] the scripture says here, having a
[33:14] readiness to revenge all disobedient. We
[33:18] want to get every disobedience out the
[33:20] way. We don't want no disobedience
[33:22] inside the kingdom of God. God want only
[33:24] obedience. Amen. And that's obedience to
[33:27] the word. So, everything we see going on
[33:29] is all because somebody don't want to
[33:31] obey.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Children get in trouble because they
[33:34] don't want to obey their parent. They
[33:35] disobedient. Mama tell them don't do
[33:38] this. Daddy said don't go here. Don't do
[33:40] this. But because of disobedience, they
[33:42] find themselves in trouble.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Doubts the same way. They get admonished
[33:47] by the word of God and tell them not to
[33:49] do this, not to do this. But because the
[33:52] spirit of disobedience is upon them,
[33:54] they go along and do what they want to
[33:56] do.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; And we find out they always in trouble.
[33:58] All your trouble in life come because of
[34:00] your disobedience.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; You have been disobedient somewhere down
[34:04] the line. So thereby you got your
[34:06] troubles. But God here this morning want
[34:09] to bring you out of your troubles. Amen.
[34:10] Out of your disobedience and want you to
[34:12] come into full obedience to what? The
[34:14] word of God. And a lot of people get
[34:16] twisted. I would use the word twisted.
[34:18] But they get mixed up sometime. And when
[34:21] talking about obedience because they
[34:22] think they're being obedient to a man.
[34:25] So therefore, they're looking at the man
[34:27] and not looking at what the word of God
[34:28] says.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; You're not being obedient to the man.
[34:31] You're being obedient to the word of
[34:32] God. God word calls for obedience. See,
[34:35] don't be disobedient. be obedient to the
[34:38] word of God. Why are we here this
[34:39] morning? Why are we in the shape we in?
[34:41] Why are we in a trouble we in? Because
[34:43] one man decided to disobey the word of
[34:46] God.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of uh Romans, the
[34:49] fifth chapter. One man decided that he
[34:51] going to disobey God's word when God
[34:54] told him what to do. Don't eat off of
[34:56] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[34:58] evil. But he made his decision to eat
[35:01] off of the tree. And all that is a type
[35:04] of Christ. We'll get into that. Let's go
[35:06] to Romans uh the 5th chapter the 19th
[35:09] verse. So all we hear today is because
[35:11] of disobedience. Don't you you your
[35:14] trouble in your life is because you've
[35:15] been disobedient.
[35:16] You will not listen to what's right. God
[35:20] has put it before you and you chose to
[35:21] walk over it. If you want to get out of
[35:24] your troubles, then come obedient to
[35:26] God's word. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:28] Romans 15, I mean Romans um five. Amen.
[35:32] Praise the Lord.
[35:36] Romans 5 and begin at the 19th verse.
[35:40] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:43] For as by one man's what?
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Disobedience.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Disobedience. Many were made sin. All
[35:48] are sinners today. Born in sin. Come
[35:50] into the world speaking lies. Why are
[35:53] you a sinner today? Because Adam
[35:54] disobeyed God's word. That why you a
[35:57] sinner. Need salvation? Because Adam
[35:59] disobeyed what God told him not to do.
[36:03] do not eat off of the tree of the
[36:05] knowledge of good and evil. But he was
[36:07] disobedient to God's word. And
[36:09] therefore, all of us now are sinners
[36:11] except those of us that have accepted
[36:13] Christ. Amen. He's come to take away our
[36:15] sins. Amen. He come to take away what?
[36:17] The sins of the world. See, we accepted
[36:19] his sacrifice. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:22] So, his disobedience now, he didn't have
[36:25] to be disobedient, but he chose to be
[36:28] disobedient. That's very important right
[36:30] there. We're going to get to that. He
[36:32] chose disobedience. Adam chose. He was
[36:35] not deceived. The Bible say Eve was
[36:37] deceived. Let's go to Timothy. Praise
[36:40] the Lord. Adam chose disobedience as a
[36:43] type of Christ because his bride was in
[36:46] trouble. His bride now was on the side
[36:49] of life. She's on the side of death.
[36:51] Therefore, Adam loving his bride, he
[36:54] chose to die with his bride, typing out
[36:57] what Christ came to do for us. Adam
[37:00] chose disobedience. He wasn't deceived.
[37:02] The devil didn't deceive Adam. Adam made
[37:04] a full conscious decision to disobey
[37:07] what God told him not to do because he
[37:09] wanted to redeem his wife. Eve fell on
[37:13] the other side. But Adam loved Eve.
[37:15] Hallelujah. When you love somebody,
[37:17] Jesus, greater love had no man than this
[37:19] that he lay down his life for his
[37:20] friend.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam loved Eve and therefore he
[37:23] stepped on the other side of the word in
[37:25] order to redeem her back. He did not was
[37:28] deceived. Devil couldn't deceive Adam.
[37:30] Adam wants the word. Amen. So God had he
[37:33] had to make a decision to break God's
[37:37] word. Become disobedient in order to
[37:40] bring salvation to his wife, his bride.
[37:43] Christ did Christ did the same thing.
[37:45] Let's go to Timothy. Praise the Lord.
[37:47] Amen. Second Timothy, I mean First
[37:49] Timothy 2.
[37:54] So disobedience, what our problem is.
[37:57] All of us got that same problem. If God
[37:59] don't help us,
[38:01] &gt;&gt; if God don't help you this morning with
[38:02] your disobedience, you can find yourself
[38:04] in a whole lot more trouble. You got to
[38:06] got out. You got to come into what?
[38:08] Obedience.
[38:10] That what the spirit of God want you in.
[38:11] He want you in full obedience to what?
[38:13] The word of God. Come into obedience
[38:16] this morning by the grace of God. Amen.
[38:18] Come into obedience to God's word. Not
[38:20] to a man, but to the word of God. Amen.
[38:22] Praise the Lord. Let's go. Timothy
[38:27] 1 Timothy uh the 2 chapter
[38:32] and we going at the uh the 12th verse.
[38:36] Um that's at 11. Let let the woman learn
[38:40] to solemn with all subjection by
[38:42] suffering not a woman to teach nor
[38:43] authority over the man but to be in
[38:44] solemn. Notice now notice God's order.
[38:47] For Adam was what? First form
[38:51] headship.
[38:52] See a woman can't be over a man. She had
[38:57] must come on the head shoulder. Adam was
[38:59] first formed. Then who? Eve. And Adam
[39:02] was what? Not deceived.
[39:05] Adam wasn't deceived. He knew exactly
[39:07] what he was doing. He made a conscious
[39:10] decision to disobey God's word. He made
[39:13] a conscious decision to step on the
[39:15] other side in order to redeem his bride
[39:18] back to him. See Jesus Christ did the
[39:22] same thing. He made a conscious decision
[39:25] to come down of glory. The Bible made
[39:28] sin for us who what knew no sin. He made
[39:31] a conscious decision to come down from
[39:34] his glory and to redeem us back to him.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; See, he didn't he didn't had to do it,
[39:38] but he had us on his mind. We are his
[39:41] bride. If you're a part of Christ, you
[39:43] are the bride of Christ. That's right.
[39:44] Jesus Christ made a conscious decision
[39:47] to come down in order to redeem his
[39:50] bride back to himself.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; His bride got out out of she was in
[39:55] disobedience. Adam bride was in
[39:57] disobedience. So was the bride of Christ
[39:59] in disobedience. Now God in the last
[40:02] days is bringing her back to obedience
[40:04] to the word of God.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We get to that.
[40:08] Amen. So the woman caused she didn't
[40:12] cause the problem but the Bible said
[40:13] that she was deceived and she was in the
[40:16] transgression. So in a way she did cause
[40:18] the problem. Now Adam because of his
[40:21] love had to step on other side of God's
[40:23] word in order to redeem her back. So
[40:25] woman got their place. Amen. Praise God.
[40:28] All women got their place in Christ.
[40:31] They got their place in the home. They
[40:33] got their place uh where God placed them
[40:36] at. So a woman not supposed to get out
[40:38] of place because when she gets out of
[40:40] place then she becomes disobedient.
[40:44] See and that what the problem is today
[40:46] we see some disobedient out of females.
[40:51] They do not want to come under obedience
[40:54] when God command them to be under
[40:55] obedience. So if you're going to get
[40:57] married remember you got to obey your
[40:59] husband. Come on somebody. You you got
[41:02] to come under obedience now. You can't
[41:04] just do what you want to do no more. You
[41:06] got to come under obedience. And Eve got
[41:08] out of out from under her headship. She
[41:11] should have waited on Adam instead of
[41:13] messing with that old serpent. Come on,
[41:16] somebody.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; She should have waited on Adam. But she
[41:20] did her she did her own thing and got
[41:23] deceived by the serpent. That's right.
[41:25] If she would have waited on her husband,
[41:27] she might have made came through. But
[41:30] because she did it on her own, then she
[41:33] Bible say she gave to Adam after she
[41:35] done what she did. But you see, she got
[41:37] from under her headship.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Got from under her leadership. And when
[41:42] you get from under your leadership, then
[41:44] you're disobedient.
[41:45] You're disobedient to what? Your
[41:47] husband. Disobedient to what? The word
[41:49] of the Lord. Husband, love your wife.
[41:52] Wives, honor, obey your husband. See,
[41:55] that's what the word say. Be obedient to
[41:57] the word. come into obedience this
[41:59] morning. Amen. Praise God. Look, here's
[42:00] another scripture here. Okay. So, we
[42:02] find a Eve was into what? Transgression.
[42:08] Because she chose not to wait on her
[42:11] head.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Adam was first formed
[42:15] than who? Eve. See? Headship. Headship.
[42:21] Let's read that. Look at it. 1
[42:23] Corinthians 11.
[42:25] So, you got to come under headship. And
[42:27] when you don't come under headship, then
[42:28] you become disobedient. Disobedient to
[42:31] what? The word of the Lord. See, y'all
[42:33] got a place. Children got their place.
[42:36] Wife got their place. Husband got their
[42:38] place. We're all under obedience. We're
[42:40] going to be obedient to somebody. Are we
[42:42] going to be disobedient to God? You
[42:44] going to obey the devil? Are you going
[42:45] to obey God? See, so which one you going
[42:47] to choose this morning? I I impair you
[42:49] uh by the word of the Lord. Come under
[42:51] obedience to the word of God. Amen.
[42:54] Praise the Lord. Come under obedience to
[42:56] his word cuz why it is good and is the
[42:59] right thing to do cuz God himself are
[43:02] looking out for your well-being.
[43:04] Everything God tells us to do is for our
[43:06] well-being. When God told them not to
[43:08] eat up the tree of the knowledge, the
[43:09] good and the evil from the beginning, it
[43:11] was for their well-being. See, but when
[43:14] they crossed that word, then bad things
[43:16] happen. We every babies crying, babies
[43:19] sick, uh uh people killing, all kind of
[43:22] stuff going on, but one man's
[43:24] disobedient.
[43:27] Just go that one act of disobedience
[43:28] cause everything to be the way it is
[43:30] today. See? Okay, let's go to uh 1
[43:32] Corinthians 11. One act of disobedience
[43:35] cause your whole home to be destroyed.
[43:38] Children, one act of disobedience cause
[43:40] your whole home to be destroyed.
[43:42] Throughout that, you might end up in
[43:44] jail. You might end up on drugs. You
[43:46] might end up on alcohol, all that. And
[43:47] what what what up the rest of your
[43:50] family going to do? Going to throw them
[43:52] all in disarray. Discord because why?
[43:55] You was disobedient.
[43:57] You chose not to listen when the right
[43:59] thing was told by the grace of God.
[44:01] Amen. 1 Corinthians 11.
[44:05] Chose not to listen. And people do it
[44:07] consciously in this in this generation.
[44:09] People know what they're doing. They
[44:10] choose not to obey. Ain't nobody making
[44:13] them not obey. They choose it
[44:14] themselves. They want to be disobedient.
[44:17] They want to not obey what God word say.
[44:20] But we in the last days. Praise God. And
[44:22] we we looking for a rapture that takes
[44:24] place. And God is trying to get you
[44:25] ready to get in that rapture. You can't
[44:27] go in there if you're disobedient to the
[44:29] word. So, you got to come into full
[44:31] obedience in order to get there by the
[44:33] grace of God. Okay. 1 Corinthians 11.
[44:37] Praise the Lord.
[44:40] [Music]
[44:44] The third verse, but have you know that
[44:47] the head of every man is who?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Christ. We got a headship. I got
[44:51] headship over me. That's Jesus Christ.
[44:54] He's the word. That's right. I got
[44:56] headship. I can't do what I want to do.
[44:59] I can't go where I want to go. I used to
[45:01] one time, but now I'm under the headship
[45:04] and now I must be obedient to what he
[45:07] says if I want to go where he wanted me
[45:09] to be at. I'm under headship to what?
[45:12] The word. I can't do I want to do no
[45:14] more. The head of every man is who?
[45:16] Christ. So Jesus Christ should be your
[45:19] head this morning.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every man in head,
[45:22] Jesus Christ should be your head. If
[45:24] Jesus Christ not your head, you need to
[45:25] make him your head. Amen. Why? Cuz he
[45:27] will lead you and guide you the right
[45:29] direction. Amen. Where the where you
[45:31] need to go how you need to be. Now the
[45:33] head of every man is Christ. And the
[45:35] head of the woman is who?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; The man.
[45:41] You didn't get here by yourself.
[45:44] You had to get You had took a man to get
[45:46] you here. Come on, somebody.
[45:49] A lot of women say, "I don't need no
[45:50] man." How'd you got here then? You got
[45:53] here by a man.
[45:56] See, that's why man is the head of the
[45:59] woman. You about get Why you teaching
[46:01] that? Because if you don't come in a
[46:02] headship, you be under disobedience.
[46:05] Many women in the last days uh they want
[46:07] to be career women and stuff like that
[46:09] and do what they want to do. So
[46:10] therefore a lot of them disobey their
[46:12] husband. They don't come under the
[46:14] headship of what their husband tell them
[46:15] to do because they got their own money.
[46:17] They got their own job to do what they
[46:18] want to do. So therefore they don't come
[46:20] under headship
[46:21] &gt;&gt; and and all and all it does is tear up
[46:23] the house, make things rough in the
[46:26] home. Why? Because the woman is supposed
[46:29] to be under the man.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] She's supposed to be under headship.
[46:35] See, and that's what it comes to.
[46:37] Headship means coming under obedience.
[46:39] Know the head of the woman is the man
[46:42] and the head of Christ is who? God. Even
[46:45] Christ got a head. God. Come on,
[46:48] somebody
[46:49] &gt;&gt; in the flesh. He's I only do the thing
[46:51] that my father tell me to do. Come on,
[46:53] somebody.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; I only do what the father tells me to
[46:56] do. I have not done anything of myself.
[46:58] When my father speak, that's what I do.
[47:01] See, he was under headship.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't do what he wanted to do. He
[47:05] listened to what the father led him to
[47:07] do. He was always being led by the
[47:10] spirit. Ain't we supposed to be led by
[47:11] the spirit?
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Always being led by the spirit. Only
[47:15] does only thing he does what the father
[47:17] showed him. Means I can do nothing of
[47:19] myself but what the father shows me that
[47:22] I will do. So showing his headship. He
[47:25] had to be under the word also because he
[47:27] was the word. Amen. So that what it is.
[47:29] So a headship. Amen. Bring coming into
[47:32] bringing obedience back. And that what
[47:35] God wants to do. Bringing full obedience
[47:37] back. Amen. To the word of God. Amen.
[47:39] Praise God. Let's go to uh 1 Corinthians
[47:41] 14. We're going to get this to you by
[47:43] the grace of God. Amen. Praise 1
[47:45] Corinthians 14. Amen.
[47:48] Amen.
[47:59] Uh uh second Corinthians, excuse me. Uh
[48:02] second Corinthians.
[48:03] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:06] I got first Corinthians. Okay. Uh y'all
[48:09] forgive me. Let me see now. I got my
[48:10] scriptures mixed up. That's all right.
[48:12] Let's go back to the book of Romans.
[48:13] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's get this
[48:16] part right here.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:22] Romans the 5th chapter.
[48:28] Hallelujah.
[48:35] All right. Romans uh 5 and1 17 it say no
[48:39] for one man's offense death reign by
[48:41] one. Much more they receive abundance of
[48:44] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[48:46] shall reign of life by one Jesus Christ.
[48:49] Therefore, as by the offense of one,
[48:51] judgment came upon all men to
[48:53] condemnation, even so by the
[48:55] righteousness of one, the free gift came
[48:57] upon all men into justification of life.
[49:00] For by one man's disobedience, we were
[49:02] all we were made sinners. So by the
[49:04] obedience of one shall all be made
[49:07] righteous. Notice now Jesus Christ came,
[49:10] Amen, as a son and he lived a life of
[49:14] obedience.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his life was a life of
[49:18] obedience. The Bible say we were made
[49:20] sinners by the disobedience of one. Now
[49:23] we're made righteous by the obedience of
[49:25] one. Here come one now that's willing to
[49:28] submit himself to the word of God. He
[49:31] did not fight against nothing God says
[49:33] and not my will but what thy will be
[49:35] done. See that's when it come to
[49:37] submitting now to headship. Submitting
[49:40] now to what the word what the word sow.
[49:43] So Jesus was obedient to every word of
[49:46] God. By his obedience to the word, he
[49:49] was able to bring righteousness back to
[49:51] me and you.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Adam through his disobedience brought us
[49:55] into condemnation. But Jesus Christ,
[49:57] amen, the Bible calls him the last Adam.
[49:59] He brought us back into fellowship with
[50:01] God if we can accept what he did.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He brought us back into
[50:06] fellowship of what he did because he was
[50:09] obedient to what the word says. Amen. He
[50:12] would not was not uh disobedient. He was
[50:14] obedient. Amen. Everything the word of
[50:17] God say he should do. Amen. Praise the
[50:20] Lord. Look at that again. Let's go to uh
[50:22] Philippians.
[50:23] Amen. Jesus Christ. Thank God for his
[50:25] obedience. He didn't rebel against the
[50:27] word like people do today. Tell them
[50:29] what the word say. They rebel against
[50:31] the word. Don't rebel against the word.
[50:33] Be obedient to the word. Amen. Let's
[50:35] look at Philippians. Amen. The second
[50:36] chapter. Amen. Praise the Lord. So Jesus
[50:39] cry. I hope y'all got that.
[50:42] obedient
[50:43] to the word. He was obedient. Therefore,
[50:45] he was able to bring salvation.
[50:47] Remember, man lost it. So, it took a man
[50:50] to bring it back.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Couldn't be an angel. God had to come
[50:54] down himself, put on flesh, become man
[50:57] for me and you in order to show that
[50:59] somebody can be obedient to the word.
[51:01] That's
[51:02] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; As a man, not as angel, not as God, but
[51:07] as the son of God. a man that can be
[51:10] obedient to the word of God.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; So don't tell me you can't be obedient.
[51:15] You can if you want to. You just got to
[51:17] make the right choice. You can be
[51:20] obedient to the word of God. Christ was
[51:22] obedient to the word. Amen. Philippians.
[51:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. So Jesus Christ
[51:26] made a decision. Amen. That he was going
[51:28] to be obedient to the word. Amen. You
[51:30] need to do the same thing. Why? Because
[51:32] your salvation is on the line.
[51:36] People say they want to be saved. Then
[51:37] you got to do what it takes to be saved.
[51:40] You'll do everything it say in the Bible
[51:42] to be saved. Not if you want to be
[51:43] saved. Now, everybody wants to go to
[51:45] heaven, but nobody wants you to do what
[51:47] it takes to get there. What it takes to
[51:49] get there is obedience.
[51:52] Obedience to the word of God. Amen.
[51:54] Hallelujah. Okay, let's look at let's go
[51:56] to uh uh Cor uh Corinthians.
[52:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. Notice uh the
[52:02] fifth verse. Second I say Corinth
[52:03] Philippians Philippians 2:5 said let
[52:06] this mind be in you which are also in
[52:08] Christ Jesus. He the same mind who who
[52:11] being in the form of God thought not rob
[52:14] with God but made himself of no
[52:16] reputation and took upon him in the form
[52:18] of a made in the likeness of man of men.
[52:21] And being found fashion as a man he
[52:23] humbled himself and became oh what
[52:26] obedient
[52:28] unto death even the death of the cross.
[52:31] God tell him to go down to the Calvary.
[52:33] He had to go. The flesh was rebelling
[52:35] against him. He had to get in prayer. By
[52:38] the way, he praying great drops of blood
[52:40] was falling because the flesh does not
[52:42] want to submit itself to the word of
[52:44] God. He prayed, the Bible said, and he
[52:47] got to the point said, "Lord, not my
[52:48] will, but thy will be done." So, let let
[52:50] this cup pass from me, but not my will,
[52:52] but your will be done. He yielded
[52:54] himself to what God want him to do. The
[52:56] Bible said he humbled himself and became
[53:00] obedient unto death, even the death of
[53:02] the cross. See how obedient he was?
[53:04] Don't you know we got to do the Bible

[53:31] Amen. See, that what you got to do.
[53:33] Whatever Jesus did, he sacrificed it all
[53:35] for the name of the Lord. Not my will,
[53:37] but your will be done. He became
[53:39] obedient unto death.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went to that cross. Amen. For
[53:44] me and you. Praise the Lord. God got a
[53:47] name with above every name. No name
[53:49] higher than the name of Jesus Christ.

[54:12] defeated them. And he hear that name of
[54:15] Jesus, he gets afraid. Amen. He afraid
[54:19] of that name of Jesus. It was used the
[54:20] right way. Now using faith and power of

[54:25] him.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; He defeated that bully of the devil.

[54:32] name of Jesus. Hallelujah.

[54:36] name of the Lord about the scrum tower.

[55:27] first of all, look, let's look at
[55:28] Abraham. Let's go to Genesis 22. Amen.
[55:31] Praise the Lord. How you know Abraham is
[55:33] our example? We children of Abraham by
[55:36] faith in Christ Jesus. That's right.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; You are children of God by faith in
[55:41] Christ Jesus. Do what Abraham did. You
[55:43] are the children of Abraham by faith in
[55:46] Christ Jesus. So therefore, you need to
[55:48] follow Abraham's steps. that we're
[55:49] supposed to be walking in the steps of
[55:50] that faith of our father Abraham. See
[55:53] now Abraham
[55:55] obeyed God.
[55:57] Amen. Praise God. Genesis 22. See now
[56:01] that's what you want to do. If you're a
[56:02] seed of Abraham, then what you do? You
[56:04] obey the word. See, Abraham's seed obeys
[56:07] the word of the Lord. They obey God's
[56:10] word. Just obey God's word. That what
[56:11] Abraham's seed uh does. Amen. Praise the
[56:14] Lord. Amen. So, you want to be obedient.

[56:39] of faith Abraham had.
[56:41] Uh and in thy seed shall all the nations
[56:44] of the earth be blessed because thou
[56:46] hast what? obeyed my voice.
[56:50] Told him to do something very hard. It'd
[56:52] be hard for you to do it today. God to
[56:55] go off up your son Isaac.
[56:57] How many y'all want to sacrifice your
[56:58] children? I guess he's I'm going to cut
[57:00] her up.
[57:02] If you don't get them to Lord, you
[57:03] already sacrifice him. You sacrifice
[57:05] them to the devil.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; You don't get them to the Lord. So you
[57:09] going to sacrifice them to God or you
[57:10] going to sacrifice them to the devil.

[57:14] Lord, you going to sacrifice them to the
[57:15] devil. You got to get them to the Lord.
[57:16] sacrifice him to the Lord. Abraham
[57:19] was willing. Amen. Praise God. God just
[57:22] gave him the son.
[57:25] This was his heart desire to get a son.
[57:27] I mean, Isaac from his wife Sarah. God
[57:29] gave him the son. And after God gave him
[57:31] the son, God said, "Go now offer thy son
[57:34] and only son Isaac whom thou lovest." Go
[57:36] from up there on the mountain Mariah. Go
[57:39] there and offer him up. Abraham being
[57:42] obedient to what God say. How many of us
[57:43] would have been obedient to that? Oh,
[57:44] that ain't no God. God never tell me to
[57:47] offer my son up, my daughter, nobody up.
[57:49] Who? That ain't God. Yeah. Abraham knew
[57:52] who voice it was. Abraham knew that was
[57:53] the voice of God. And he recognized the
[57:56] voice. Therefore, he was able to obey
[57:57] the voice. How many of y'all can
[57:58] recognize the voice of God this morning?
[58:00] Hallelujah. You got to be able to
[58:02] recognize his voice. His voice is his
[58:03] word. That's right. Abraham recognized
[58:06] the voice.
[58:08] It he knew that was God talking to him.
[58:12] Go there and offer up thy son thy only
[58:14] son Isaac whom thou lovest upon one of
[58:16] the mountain I tell you of go offer him
[58:19] up Abraham didn't stagger at it the
[58:20] Bible say he didn't stagger the promise
[58:22] of God through unbelief Abraham believed
[58:24] God and Abraham went up there went
[58:26] through everything got the wood got
[58:29] Isaac up there told the people y'all
[58:31] stay here y'all there while me and our
[58:32] son go and worship and we coming back he
[58:36] already speaking faith no doubt he know
[58:38] that God promised him Isaac he couldn't
[58:39] kill him or he had to raise him back up
[58:42] again. So he went there. Amen. He
[58:44] offered he would get ready to do a he
[58:46] had the knife in his hand ready to slay
[58:48] Isaac and the the angel voice came from
[58:51] heaven say don't slay the child. See
[58:54] then the voice came right here. Let's
[58:56] read that again by the grace of God. See
[58:57] I want you to know I mean the Holy
[58:58] Spirit I want you to get this.
[59:01] Uh
[59:02] and in thy sea shall all the nation of
[59:05] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[59:08] what? obeyed my voice.
[59:12] See, he obeyed the voice of God. Amen.
[59:15] Let's get go up a little a little
[59:17] further right here. Catch this right
[59:18] here. The ninth verse. And they came to
[59:20] the place which God had told him of. And
[59:22] Abraham built an altar there and laid
[59:24] the wooden altar and bound Isaac his son
[59:26] and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
[59:28] And Abraham scrept forth his hand and
[59:30] took the knife to slay his son.
[59:31] Obedient.
[59:33] Not thinking about it. Obedient.
[59:37] Not wondering about it. obedient.
[59:39] Hallelujah. Sometime we want to reason
[59:42] it out. Is that God talking? You got to
[59:44] believe it's him. Abraham did. See, he
[59:48] believed it was God telling him to do
[59:50] that. And because he believed, Amen. He
[59:53] got the reward. Notice he scrap forth
[59:55] his hand, took the knives, and the angel
[59:57] of the Lord called him out of heaven and
[59:59] said, Abraham, Abraham, he said, here am
[1:00:01] I. He said, lay not thine hand upon the
[1:00:03] lad. Now do thou anything unto him. For
[1:00:05] now I know that thou fierce God, see thy
[1:00:08] not withheld thy son, thine only son
[1:00:11] from me. See, give up everything for the
[1:00:13] Lord. That thing Yho did, give it up for
[1:00:15] the Lord. Be obedient. Sacrifice
[1:00:17] everything. Amen. For Christ's sake. Oh,
[1:00:19] hallelujah. We see that Abraham obedient
[1:00:22] to the word. Amen. Getting the the
[1:00:26] blessing because I have obeyed my voice.
[1:00:30] I in blessing. I'll bless thee. I'll
[1:00:32] bless thy seed after thee. I'm going to
[1:00:35] bless you. Why? Because you was so
[1:00:36] obedient to what I told you to do.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; See, that's why why people want to be
[1:00:43] blessed. Do you want to be blessed this
[1:00:44] morning? Hallelujah. If you want to be
[1:00:46] blessed, then come into obedience to the
[1:00:48] word of God. Hallelujah. Oh Lord,
[1:00:50] everything we know to do, right? Let's
[1:00:52] do it in the name of Jesus. Why? Because
[1:00:54] God are looking for obedience to the
[1:00:56] word of God. Hallelujah. Lord, help me
[1:00:58] to be obedient. See, that what you want
[1:01:01] your prayer to be. Help me to be
[1:01:02] obedient, Lord. If I'm disobedient, a
[1:01:04] lot of people don't want to confess
[1:01:05] they're disobedient, but if he is, then
[1:01:07] you need to ask God to help you this
[1:01:08] morning in Jesus Christ's name. He
[1:01:10] coming here to help you. He wants to
[1:01:12] help you by the grace of God. Amen.
[1:01:13] Praise the Lord. Notice now, look at
[1:01:15] some disobedience. How many y'all think
[1:01:17] disobedience is good? This ain't no
[1:01:19] good, children. Disobedience ain't no
[1:01:21] good. Ain't no good at all. It'll get
[1:01:23] you in trouble. How many young people
[1:01:25] locked up in jail today this morning?
[1:01:28] How many young people done lost their
[1:01:29] life?
[1:01:31] How many middle-aged people, older
[1:01:33] people are in all kind of trouble all
[1:01:35] because they chose to be disobedient?
[1:01:37] The disobedience ain't no good. I rather
[1:01:39] be obedient than disobedient.
[1:01:41] I rather come into obedience to my
[1:01:43] parents. Amen. Those that have authority
[1:01:46] over me, I want to be obedient. I want
[1:01:49] to cuz I want the blessing. See, you
[1:01:51] want you want the blessing that comes
[1:01:52] from being obedient. Amen. Those Let's
[1:01:55] go to 1st Samuel 15. Amen. Praise the
[1:01:58] Lord. So disobedience is no good. It's
[1:02:01] no good. But why is of the devil? The
[1:02:04] devil is the one that started all this
[1:02:06] disobedience. He brought her inside the
[1:02:09] garden of Eden. He himself was
[1:02:10] disobedient to the word of the Lord. He
[1:02:11] himself rebelled against God inside
[1:02:14] heaven. Amen. He wanted to be something
[1:02:16] he wasn't he wasn't made to be. He
[1:02:17] wanted to be God. And all he was he was
[1:02:19] a created being. See, and he brought
[1:02:22] disobedience down to the earth. He
[1:02:23] brought it down and to the man and to
[1:02:25] the woman. So yeah, all the stuff the
[1:02:28] devil is the one that got people
[1:02:29] disobedient. We can read that to you by
[1:02:31] the grace of God. So you got to have you
[1:02:33] want to be obedient cuz the devil is the
[1:02:36] one that brings the disobedience. Let me
[1:02:38] let's read that real quick before we get
[1:02:39] there. I'm going to read that. Let's go
[1:02:40] back uh to the book of Ephesians. Amen.
[1:02:42] The second chapter. Say, "Brother, get
[1:02:45] that ain't right." Yes, it is.
[1:02:55] Ephesians the 2 chapter notice now
[1:02:58] uh Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he
[1:03:01] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:03:03] and sins when a time pass you walked
[1:03:06] according to the course of this world
[1:03:08] according to the prince of the power of
[1:03:10] the air the spirit that now workketh in
[1:03:13] who
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; uh what disobedience
[1:03:18] so the evil spirit working got these
[1:03:21] children disobedient
[1:03:23] the evil spirit in the atmosphere that
[1:03:26] got the children disobedient. See, it's
[1:03:28] an evil spirit and they try to follow
[1:03:30] that spirit. Don't follow the crowd. Be
[1:03:33] different. Stand alone if you have to.
[1:03:37] The God can bless you. You don't have to
[1:03:38] be a crowd followower, a crowdleaser in
[1:03:41] the last days with these people, these
[1:03:43] disobedient spirits on them. See,
[1:03:46] children follow that. They want to be a
[1:03:47] part of the crowd and all that stuff.
[1:03:49] But they ain't ain't no harm in being
[1:03:51] different. Jesus was different.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah. He was not a part of any
[1:03:56] crowd. He wasn't a part of their
[1:03:58] denominations of that day. He was
[1:04:00] different. Therefore, they didn't like
[1:04:02] him. And when you act different and be
[1:04:04] different, there going to talk about
[1:04:05] you. But guess what? That's all right.
[1:04:08] See, don't let that scare you off from
[1:04:10] being different. When I say different,
[1:04:12] what I mean living like a Christian
[1:04:13] should live. You have to follow the
[1:04:16] crowd because the crowd going to lead
[1:04:17] you to the wrong place. Uh broad is the
[1:04:19] way, wide is the gate that leadth to
[1:04:22] destruction. Many there be which go
[1:04:24] there at because what straight is the
[1:04:26] gate, narrow is the way that leadth to
[1:04:29] life, and few
[1:04:32] few there be that find it. Did y'all
[1:04:33] hear that this morning?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Wide is that gate to go to destruction.
[1:04:37] It's a broad gate. Many people going
[1:04:38] through there. The crowd, don't follow
[1:04:40] the crowd. Be different. Young people,
[1:04:42] be different. Stand your ground. Stand
[1:04:45] up for what you have learned and heard.
[1:04:47] Be obedient to it. Why? It going to save
[1:04:49] your life. Hallelujah. Amen. I got off a
[1:04:52] little bit. Praise the Lord. Notice now
[1:04:54] the spirit that now workketh where? In
[1:04:57] the children of disobedience. So what is
[1:04:59] a evil spirit? The prince of the power
[1:05:02] of the air. The spirit that now workketh
[1:05:04] in the children of disobedience. So it's
[1:05:06] the evil spirit of the devil that got
[1:05:08] people under disobedience. They don't
[1:05:10] want to be obedient. Why? Cuz the spirit
[1:05:12] in them won't let them. There evil
[1:05:14] spirit. Until that spirit is cast out,
[1:05:16] that's when he'll be obedient.
[1:05:18] Hallelujah. When the Lord saved my soul,
[1:05:20] that when that disobedient spirit left
[1:05:21] me. Hallelujah. I was a different person
[1:05:24] today. Hallelujah. Mama, what you want,
[1:05:26] mama? I'll do anything for my mama, my
[1:05:29] grandma. Why? That disobedient spirit
[1:05:30] was gone.
[1:05:32] Praise the Lord. I was a different
[1:05:33] person. Didn't want to be disobedient to
[1:05:36] mama no more. Praise the Lord. Whatever
[1:05:38] mama want, I got. The dis disobedient
[1:05:40] spirit was gone. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:43] God cast it out. Praise the Lord. See,
[1:05:45] until that disobedient spirit leaves
[1:05:47] your body, you going to be disobedient.
[1:05:50] See, there we go. Hallelujah. You got to
[1:05:52] come into the word. The word, what
[1:05:54] castes the spirits out. The Bible said
[1:05:56] Jesus cast out the spirit with his word.
[1:05:58] So when you come under the word, it
[1:06:00] castes out the evil spirit. If you allow
[1:06:02] the word to penetrate, if you allow the
[1:06:04] word to sink in, don't fight against the
[1:06:06] word. Be obedient to the word. Amen.
[1:06:09] See, it it castes out the spirits. Amen.
[1:06:12] Pray the Lord. Look at the script. Let's
[1:06:14] go to the book of Psalms. Let's go to
[1:06:15] 1st Samuel 15. Amen. Pray the Lord. We
[1:06:17] coming to a close. I want you to help me
[1:06:19] by the Holy Spirit. Amen. I want you to
[1:06:21] see the importance of this age that the
[1:06:24] spirit in this age is disobedient to the
[1:06:26] word. And God wants you if you a child
[1:06:30] to come under obedience. That was a
[1:06:32] coming into obedience. We working on
[1:06:35] that. Paul said those Corinthians, he
[1:06:38] said when you're obedient, having a
[1:06:40] readiness in mind to revenge all
[1:06:42] disobedience, when your obedience is
[1:06:44] fulfilled. See, when you can come to
[1:06:47] that point, you ready to obey every word
[1:06:49] of God, then you won't get around no
[1:06:51] disobedience.
[1:06:52] Amen. Well, say the prophet say full
[1:06:54] obedience gives you the right to what?
[1:06:57] The token. Full obedience to the word of
[1:06:59] God. See, that where you want to come to
[1:07:02] come to that full obedience. Look at
[1:07:03] first 1st Samuel 15. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:06] Notice now saw y'all know the story
[1:07:09] Saul.
[1:07:11] Uh he started off good but end up wrong.
[1:07:14] Y a lot of young people do. They start
[1:07:16] off good old older people too. I ain't
[1:07:18] excluding myself. Uh we start off right
[1:07:21] but what we end up wrong. Why? Cuz we
[1:07:24] got disobedient. We listen to the wrong
[1:07:26] thing. Is that what happened to Saul?
[1:07:29] Let's go to 1st Samuel 15 and uh start
[1:07:31] the 13th verse. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:33] What happened to Saul? He started off so
[1:07:36] good, doing the right thing, being
[1:07:39] obedient to everything Samuel told him.
[1:07:41] But then God told him to go and do
[1:07:43] something. God told Sam and Saul, "Go
[1:07:47] and kill those Amalachites." I remember
[1:07:49] what they did to Israel when they came
[1:07:52] out of Egypt and they passed by the way.
[1:07:54] They came and did evil to Israel. And
[1:07:55] God remembered that. Then God is sending
[1:07:58] Saul to avenge that. Don't you know your
[1:08:00] enemies, the people that do you wrong,
[1:08:02] God got them.
[1:08:04] They ain't getting away. Nobody gets
[1:08:06] away. Don't you worry about it. You go
[1:08:09] keep on being a Christian cuz God don't
[1:08:11] forget God. I remember that what
[1:08:14] Amalecch did. Now God is sending Saul
[1:08:16] down there to wipe him out. Let's read
[1:08:20] it by the grace of God.
[1:08:22] So he done went and now Samuel came to
[1:08:24] him and Samuel said to Saul and Saul
[1:08:27] said unto him, "Blessed be thou of the
[1:08:29] Lord. I have performed the commandments
[1:08:31] of the Lord." And Samuel said, "What
[1:08:33] mean the bleeding of the sheep? What
[1:08:36] mean the sheep around here?" So God
[1:08:37] said, "Go kill everything. Go kill ox
[1:08:40] and donkey,
[1:08:42] uh, sheep and oxen,
[1:08:45] uh, suckling and go kill everything. He
[1:08:47] won't leave nothing. Kill a little
[1:08:49] chilling. Kill everything." That's kind
[1:08:52] of cruel, don't it? That ain't cruel.
[1:08:55] God reward them for their sins. Don't
[1:08:57] you know God can reward you for your
[1:08:58] sins one day, too? You don't get right
[1:09:00] for God, you be lost. So God that ain't
[1:09:03] crew. They did it to themselves. God
[1:09:05] just executing judgment. Now y'all got
[1:09:07] to understand the righteousness of the
[1:09:08] Lord. The God is righteous. Amen. Praise
[1:09:10] the Lord. So now he comes back. He got
[1:09:13] sheep around him. He got oxen around
[1:09:15] him. And th say, they have brought them
[1:09:18] from the Amalachites. For the people
[1:09:20] spared the best of the sheep and oxen to
[1:09:22] sacrifice to the Lord thy God, and the
[1:09:25] rest we have utterly destroyed. Then
[1:09:27] Samuel said unto Saul, "Stay, and I will
[1:09:29] tell thee what the Lord has sent me."
[1:09:31] Notice your relatives, your friends,
[1:09:34] your cousin are called you to be
[1:09:35] disobedient if you listen to them.
[1:09:40] Saul listened to the people.
[1:09:43] He listened to what the people said. Oh
[1:09:45] man, that sheep look too good. Let's
[1:09:46] don't kill that sheep. Oh, that oxen,
[1:09:48] man. I can use that oxen around the
[1:09:50] house, man. Let's don't kill that oxen.
[1:09:52] Let's let's save if some of the stuff
[1:09:53] alive, Saul, because we can use this
[1:09:56] stuff. But what God say? God said, "Kill
[1:09:59] everything." That's right. Could y'all
[1:10:01] hear me this morning?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; God told him to kill everything, but he
[1:10:05] listened to the people. How many of
[1:10:06] y'all done got yourself in trouble
[1:10:08] because you listen to your relatives?
[1:10:12] You know you wasn't supposed to do that
[1:10:13] with old cuz old cuz said, "Let's do
[1:10:16] this right here. Let's go here. Let's do
[1:10:18] this." Oh, cuz don't you let C get you
[1:10:20] disobedient.
[1:10:23] Used to be obedient to the word of God.
[1:10:24] This is real. Uh uh he let the people
[1:10:28] persuade him to disobey God's word. How
[1:10:32] many of y'all let your relative persuade
[1:10:34] y'all to be disobedient to the word of
[1:10:36] the Lord? You rather listen to them or
[1:10:39] listen to your mama. I I get them a
[1:10:40] little all the time. Uh uh your friends
[1:10:43] don't come before your parents. Your
[1:10:45] parents come before your friends.
[1:10:47] I know you love your friends. You like
[1:10:49] to talk to them on the phone and
[1:10:50] FaceTime and all that stuff, but mom and
[1:10:53] daddy come first. When mom and Daddy say
[1:10:55] cut it off, let's cut it off. Mom and
[1:10:58] Daddy say let's put it up. Let's put it
[1:11:00] up. But my friends, so what? Your
[1:11:02] friends got to We don't need them right
[1:11:04] now. Need to be obedient to the word of
[1:11:06] the Lord right now. Hope y'all
[1:11:08] understand what we're saying. Your
[1:11:10] parents, your friends, uh parent, but
[1:11:12] your friends, your relatives, all that,
[1:11:14] all them people around you. Amen. They
[1:11:16] can cause you if you let them to
[1:11:18] disobey, be disobedient to the word of
[1:11:20] the Lord. This is what happened to Saul.
[1:11:23] He became disobedient because he
[1:11:25] listened to the people then listened to
[1:11:27] God. Look all the trouble it caused him
[1:11:29] in his life. He lost his kingship.
[1:11:33] A evil spirit from the Lord came on. He
[1:11:35] began to want to kill David. Look all
[1:11:36] that. All because of what? Disobedience.
[1:11:39] If you had went down there and did what
[1:11:41] God told him to do, none of that stuff
[1:11:43] would have happened. But because of his
[1:11:44] disobedience, he got in the shape he was
[1:11:47] in. How many people done lives just
[1:11:49] messed up because of one little act of
[1:11:50] disobedience? Hope you hear me this
[1:11:52] morning. Amen. You got to come into
[1:11:54] obedience to somebody.
[1:11:56] Got to listen to somebody. I hope you
[1:11:58] listen to the right person because you
[1:11:59] going to listen to somebody. Amen. They
[1:12:02] going to tell you what's right or wrong.
[1:12:03] Hope you don't listen to the wrong
[1:12:04] thing. I hope by the grace of God, you
[1:12:06] got enough discernment to come under the
[1:12:08] the the right thing.
[1:12:10] See, especially in the age we living in
[1:12:12] the last time, the last days and see all
[1:12:15] this stuff going on. So Saul, he chose
[1:12:17] to what? Disobey. All because of what
[1:12:20] the people said. All because of what my
[1:12:22] cousins say, my aunt said, my this one
[1:12:24] said, that one said, I'mma do like they
[1:12:26] say do because they know what they
[1:12:28] talking about. Not all the time they
[1:12:30] don't. Especially go against the word of
[1:12:32] the Lord. They don't nothing talking
[1:12:33] about. So you better be obedient to the
[1:12:34] word of the Lord. Amen. Notice now. So
[1:12:36] he he he got messed up.
[1:12:40] He messed up. A lot of people lives
[1:12:42] messed up. Amen. Let's go that
[1:12:44] scripture. Let's go to the book of
[1:12:46] Romans. There's another example I wanted
[1:12:48] to read you, but I'm going just talk to
[1:12:49] you about it. It was this man. It was a
[1:12:51] prophet. And God sent him to prophesy
[1:12:53] against this king. And God told him when
[1:12:56] he told him to go down, don't eat no
[1:12:57] bread and don't drink no water. Uh just
[1:12:59] go back another way. Don't stay around
[1:13:01] the place he went and prophesied. The
[1:13:02] prophecy came to pass and everything.
[1:13:04] And then all of a sudden there was old
[1:13:06] prophet there. A old prophet. And this
[1:13:09] old prophet. Yeah. This old prophet. And
[1:13:12] he was there. And he said, "Uh, which
[1:13:14] way did the man of God went that did the
[1:13:16] prophecy?" And he told him where the man
[1:13:17] of God went. He went and said man talked
[1:13:20] to him and said I'm a prophet too and
[1:13:22] the word of the law came to me and said
[1:13:24] come back and eat bread and drink water.
[1:13:29] Then the Bible say if an angel come from
[1:13:31] heaven come speaking any other thing let
[1:13:32] him be what? A cursed.
[1:13:36] Somebody tell you something contrary to
[1:13:37] what God word say let him be what? A
[1:13:39] cursed. And this old prophet lied to
[1:13:42] him. And the Bible say he lied to the
[1:13:43] man and he went back and ate bread and
[1:13:46] drank water where God told him not to
[1:13:47] do. And the Bible said a lion slew him.
[1:13:51] A lion caught him and slew him. And the
[1:13:53] Bible said a lion caught him and slew
[1:13:55] him because he was disobedient to the
[1:13:57] word of the Lord. See what disobedience
[1:13:59] cause? All kind of trouble. God said,
[1:14:02] "Lord, help me to be obedient." Amen.
[1:14:04] Let me be obedient to the pastor.
[1:14:07] Let me be obedient to my parents. Let me
[1:14:10] be obedient to the word of the Lord.
[1:14:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me be
[1:14:14] obedient. It's not what I want to do no
[1:14:16] more, but what you want to do, Lord. How
[1:14:18] many say, "Lord, have your way in my
[1:14:19] life."
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; So, you done told the Lord to have his
[1:14:23] way. Let him have his way.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Let him have his way. Be obedient cuz he
[1:14:29] not going to lead you wrong. Praise the
[1:14:31] Lord. We coming down. Let's look at it.
[1:14:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh uh uh
[1:14:36] let's go to Romans. Amen. The 10th
[1:14:38] chapter.
[1:14:43] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:45] Uh, could y'all forgive me?
[1:14:50] Let's go. Okay, let me get to Romans. I
[1:14:52] got another scripture there. Praise the
[1:14:54] Lord. Amen.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:59] Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] Romans uh 10 and uh 21.
[1:15:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:15] All right. Uh start the 17th verse. So
[1:15:17] then faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:15:19] by the word of God. But it say uh have
[1:15:22] we not heard? Yes. Verily the sign went
[1:15:23] into all the earth and the words to the
[1:15:25] end of ends of the world. But I say not
[1:15:27] Israel know. First Moses said, I will
[1:15:29] provoke you to jealousy by them that are
[1:15:31] no people and by a foolish nation I will
[1:15:33] anger you. But Isaiah, Isaiah is very
[1:15:36] bold and saith, I was found of them that
[1:15:38] sought me not, talking us Gentiles, I
[1:15:40] made manif not after me. Notice, but the
[1:15:42] Israel he saith all day long I have
[1:15:46] stretched forth my hands unto what a
[1:15:49] disobedient and gains people. I wonder
[1:15:52] the same thing going on this last
[1:15:53] generation. You know, Israel is a type
[1:15:55] of the church coming out of the
[1:15:57] wilderness, coming out of Egypt. God
[1:16:00] brought us out of the world and we
[1:16:02] supposed to be coming out going to the
[1:16:03] promised land. Israel left Egypt. Amen.
[1:16:06] Going to the promised land. And all down
[1:16:08] through that journey,
[1:16:10] Moses had trouble with those disobedient
[1:16:12] people.
[1:16:14] All that journey. Y'all read read your
[1:16:16] Bible. How Moses suffered with those
[1:16:18] disobedient people. And God send all day
[1:16:21] long straight forth my hands unto
[1:16:23] disobedient people. I wonder the same
[1:16:25] thing going on here in the last days
[1:16:26] when God got a bride and get together
[1:16:28] and he trying his best to get people to
[1:16:30] come to obedience and they still being
[1:16:32] disobedient.
[1:16:34] Moses a type of Christ
[1:16:37] bringing the people out. I wonder the
[1:16:39] same thing. You know it happens again.
[1:16:41] See it repeats itself how it happened.
[1:16:44] Moses a prophet Christ Moses a prophet
[1:16:46] like unto Christ. Moses prophesied the
[1:16:48] Lord of God forever but prophet like
[1:16:50] unto me. Amen. And he said uh to me to
[1:16:53] him all the people come. So I wanted the
[1:16:55] same thing happening again. He went on a
[1:16:58] journey going to the promised land and
[1:17:00] here the people are still being
[1:17:02] disobedient.
[1:17:04] Won't come in obedience to the word of
[1:17:05] the law. See that what Moses problem was
[1:17:07] with the people of his day. I wonder the
[1:17:09] same thing going on today. Praise the
[1:17:11] Lord. It may be all right. Look at
[1:17:13] again. Let's go to another scripture
[1:17:14] here. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to
[1:17:16] uh let's see um the book of uh
[1:17:22] let's go to Luke
[1:17:25] Luke the first chapter.
[1:17:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:31] Luke the 1st chapter
[1:17:33] and uh uh one uh the 17th verse. Praise
[1:17:39] the Lord.
[1:17:46] Amen. And he shall go before him in the
[1:17:49] spirit and power of Elias, talking about
[1:17:52] John the Baptist. John the Baptist,
[1:17:55] Amen, was prophesied he should come.
[1:17:58] Amen. For that day, and turn the people
[1:18:01] back to the Lord because they gotten
[1:18:03] away from God that Israel did. And so
[1:18:06] therefore, uh, Elias, if y'all read the
[1:18:09] Bible, y'all know the spirit of Elias.
[1:18:10] that Elias was uh came down to Israel
[1:18:13] when they was worshiping Baal and he
[1:18:15] came down he prophesied and turned the
[1:18:18] people back to God. All right. So now
[1:18:20] John the Baptist, amen, is here on the
[1:18:22] scene doing the same thing. He said he
[1:18:24] should go before him in the spirit of
[1:18:25] power to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:18:27] to the children and the disobedient to
[1:18:30] the wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:18:33] people prepared for the Lord. How many
[1:18:35] of y'all see that this morning?
[1:18:37] John the Baptist came with a ministry to
[1:18:41] bring the people back to the word of
[1:18:43] God. Say the hearts of the fathers to
[1:18:45] the children, the hearts of the children
[1:18:47] to the fathers, lest I come and smite
[1:18:48] the earth with a curse. God had done it
[1:18:50] today. He has sent a prophet. Amen. To
[1:18:53] turn our hearts back to the word of God
[1:18:55] again. Turn the disobedient to what? The
[1:18:57] wisdom of the just.
[1:19:00] Bringing us back into obedience to the
[1:19:02] word of God. Bringing us back into what?
[1:19:04] Obedience. see to God's word. That's
[1:19:07] where we want to be at. We want to be
[1:19:08] disobedient. We want to be obedient.
[1:19:10] That's right. Bible say once upon Paul
[1:19:12] say uh Peter said obedient children. We
[1:19:14] want to be obedient to what God word
[1:19:16] say. Amen. Praise the Lord. So you want
[1:19:18] to come uh into obedience. Amen. I want
[1:19:21] to get to a scripture by the grace of
[1:19:22] y'all. Pray for me. Let's go to uh first
[1:19:24] Kings
[1:19:26] uh
[1:19:28] let's see now. Okay. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:31] Let's go to uh first uh
[1:19:35] Chronicles.
[1:19:39] 1 Chronicles
[1:19:49] 29.
[1:19:54] It'd be good if Lord bless you to read
[1:19:56] this here.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:20:05] Uh let's start at the uh 21st uh 20th
[1:20:08] verse of this uh Chronicles 29. And
[1:20:10] David said all the congregation now
[1:20:12] blessed the Lord your God and all the
[1:20:14] congregation blessed the Lord God of
[1:20:15] their fathers and bowed down their heads
[1:20:17] and worshiped the Lord and the king. And
[1:20:19] they sacrifice uh sacrifice unto the
[1:20:22] Lord and burnt offerings uh unto the
[1:20:24] Lord. on the morning after the evening a
[1:20:26] thousand bulocks and a thousand rams and
[1:20:27] a thousand lambs with their drink
[1:20:29] offering and sacrifice in abundance for
[1:20:30] all Israel. And then Eden drank before
[1:20:33] the Lord on that day with great
[1:20:35] gladness. And they made Solomon the son
[1:20:38] of David king the second time and
[1:20:41] anointed him unto the Lord to be chief
[1:20:43] governor and Zadok the priest. So
[1:20:46] talking about Solomon, how many Solomon
[1:20:48] is a type of Christ? Solomon kingdom was
[1:20:51] a type of the millennium. how he came
[1:20:52] into a prosperous period, amen, of for
[1:20:55] all Israel. And all Israel was subject
[1:20:58] unto Solomon. Amen. Because God had
[1:21:01] anointed Solomon with the spirit of
[1:21:02] wisdom and understanding. And all the
[1:21:05] nations worshiped Solomon. Brought
[1:21:08] Solomon gifts. Came to hear his wisdom
[1:21:10] because it wasn't a man on the earth
[1:21:12] that has the wisdom of Solomon. That's
[1:21:14] right. Now here he is anointed king.
[1:21:18] Amen. Type of Christ. All right. Then
[1:21:20] Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as
[1:21:24] king instead of David his father and
[1:21:26] prospered and all Israel what? Obeyed
[1:21:30] him. I love that. All Israel from the
[1:21:34] teeniest child to the oldest man they
[1:21:37] became obedient to what Solomon had to
[1:21:39] say. Same thing get ready to take place.
[1:21:42] Everybody going to obey Christ. Come on
[1:21:44] somebody. You got to bow down now or
[1:21:47] bow. Let every knee shall bow. Every
[1:21:49] tongue shall confess he's law to the
[1:21:51] glory of God the father. Everybody had
[1:21:53] to do what? Obey Solomon.
[1:21:56] Had to come in obedience to what Solomon
[1:21:58] was doing. The kingdom, Amen, was under
[1:22:00] a great prosperity because God had came
[1:22:03] down. Amen. Y'all know when Solomon made
[1:22:06] to pray in the temple, the spirit of the
[1:22:07] Lord came down. It was so great they
[1:22:09] came stay in the house to minister. Why?
[1:22:11] Cuz God was establishing Solomon's
[1:22:13] kingdom. Now God doing the same when
[1:22:16] Christ come to reign, God going to
[1:22:17] establish his kingdom and everything
[1:22:20] going to have to obey him. There be no
[1:22:22] disobedience up there. Hallelujah. You
[1:22:25] either be obedience now or you won't be
[1:22:27] obedient later. See everything going
[1:22:29] have to come and be obedient to what
[1:22:31] Christ say. See Solomon is a type of
[1:22:34] Christ. When the kingdom is set up then
[1:22:37] everything going to obey him. Remember
[1:22:40] there's no backbiters up there.
[1:22:43] None of that stuff going to be up there
[1:22:45] in that day. See, all that going to be
[1:22:47] cast out now. Everything is under the
[1:22:50] reign of Christ. Everything comes under
[1:22:52] him. And everything that's up there is
[1:22:54] going to obey him. How many of you want
[1:22:56] to be obedient this morning?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] Obedience to what? The word of the Lord.
[1:23:02] See, not to man, but unto Christ. When
[1:23:06] you hear the word, then you want to be
[1:23:08] obedient to what the word is saying.
[1:23:10] There's so many things we can say along
[1:23:11] that line, but God knows. Amen. But the
[1:23:13] main thing is saints by the grace of God
[1:23:16] in this ob disobedient age that we live
[1:23:18] in
[1:23:20] from the White House on down he don't do
[1:23:23] nothing the courts tell him to do that's
[1:23:25] the most disobedient angate man the
[1:23:27] devil almost on the face of earth other
[1:23:28] than Satan
[1:23:31] everybody knows that ain't nothing
[1:23:32] hiding
[1:23:34] disobedient all his people that he
[1:23:36] elected to be with him disobedient
[1:23:39] agorant and stubborn will not listen to
[1:23:42] nothing that's right. What kind of
[1:23:44] spirit that is? The spirit of the devil.
[1:23:47] He did not want to listen to what was
[1:23:48] right. Therefore, God kicked him out of
[1:23:51] heaven. See, you got to be obedient. You
[1:23:54] can't walk this life being disobedient
[1:23:56] because bad things will happen. See? So,
[1:23:59] you got to come under obedience. Now,
[1:24:00] I'm imploring you this morning. Make
[1:24:02] your choice. Hallelujah. Make your
[1:24:05] choice to be obedient to the word of the
[1:24:07] Lord. I don't like that man. And don't
[1:24:10] let that get inside your way. Get be
[1:24:12] obedient to the word of the Lord. I
[1:24:14] don't like how you preach. Don't let
[1:24:15] that get in your way either. Be obedient
[1:24:16] to the word of the Lord. Hallelujah.

[1:24:21] to a man, but to the word. See, cuz
[1:24:23] that's what's going to save you in that
[1:24:25] day. The word of the Lord is what's
[1:24:26] going to save you. See, and God is
[1:24:28] calling now for obedience.
[1:24:30] Bible say past God wked at man's
[1:24:33] ignorance. But now in the last days
[1:24:35] calling all men unto repentance. God's
[1:24:38] not wake in that ignorance anymore. He's
[1:24:40] calling you, Amen, to come to obedience.
[1:24:43] Come to obedience this morning. Obey the
[1:24:45] word of the Lord. Young young people,
[1:24:48] obey the word of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] Our older people, we like we we done got
[1:24:52] so old and comfortable, we think we can
[1:24:54] do what we want to do. No, we still got
[1:24:55] to come in obedience. Let's go to listen
[1:24:57] to somebody. The old age don't excuse
[1:24:59] us. Amen. Praise God. We got to come
[1:25:02] under subjection to somebody. Hope it be
[1:25:03] the word of the Lord. Amen. Let us pray.
[1:25:06] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we thank you,
[1:25:08] Lord, for your word. Thank you for the
[1:25:10] people, Lord, that sat patiently to hear
[1:25:11] your word. Pray someone said it'll be a
[1:25:13] blessing to them to help them in this
[1:25:15] journey of life. Hallelujah. As we
[1:25:17] journey, Lord, toward the kingdom of
[1:25:18] God. I pray you bless them, Lord. Thank
[1:25:20] you for brother Hen to stand here this
[1:25:22] morning. I pray you bless him, this
[1:25:23] congregation, you commit them inside
[1:25:25] your hands. We ask you to have your way.
[1:25:27] And we thank you in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:25:29] Amen. God bless you.
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:39] Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank God for
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Dwayne. Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; He's I thought about when they were
[1:25:50] teenagers, him and his first cousin. and
[1:25:54] his first cousin came down from New York
[1:25:56] and they were in high school
[1:25:59] and they were we were witnessing through
[1:26:03] Georgetown, South Carolina and walking
[1:26:05] through the streets knocking on doors
[1:26:08] talking to the young and the old to give
[1:26:11] their life to the Lord.
[1:26:14] And his cousin,
[1:26:16] first cousin always was in competition
[1:26:20] with him.
[1:26:22] They were
[1:26:24] a I think Dwayne was straight A's and
[1:26:29] high school. Could have went in any
[1:26:31] college scholarships and all. And the
[1:26:34] other cousin was AB student, but he
[1:26:37] wanted to be straight A too
[1:26:40] because he had that New York about him.
[1:26:45] He was always,
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:48] you know, sneaky.
[1:26:52] But there was two. He knocked doors. He
[1:26:55] walked streets with me too.
[1:27:00] They both became ministers.
[1:27:04] And as they became ministers,
[1:27:08] somebody to came in the church and told
[1:27:11] the young man because both of them was
[1:27:13] more intelligent than me was uh
[1:27:17] intellect and educated.
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:20] So I says well it was only the
[1:27:24] difference was God gave a gift.
[1:27:28] See
[1:27:30] one listened the other one people start
[1:27:33] saying man you're so smart and he
[1:27:36] listened to the people told him he's so
[1:27:38] smart he was
[1:27:44] and they told him said you ought to be
[1:27:46] over
[1:27:48] you ought to be over the pastor you you
[1:27:50] you you a pastor
[1:27:53] he listened
[1:27:55] next thing you know he was gone home.
[1:27:58] Thought he was Vicki.
[1:28:02] Later on in life, he called me sometimes
[1:28:05] 3 4:00 in the morning, family busted up,
[1:28:09] this that and the other.
[1:28:13] Said, "I want to come back to church and
[1:28:14] be a minister again." I said, "No,
[1:28:17] brother. You can't. You can't be a
[1:28:20] minister now." He said, "Yeah, but I
[1:28:22] want to come back." guy says, "No, your
[1:28:25] life, you got to get your life back
[1:28:26] together."
[1:28:28] But it
[1:28:30] he said, "Uh,
[1:28:32] but I want to come back and I want to
[1:28:34] preach. I want to tell people." I said,
[1:28:35] "No, you got to get your life together."
[1:28:39] But he didn't want to come under the
[1:28:41] terms of getting his life together. He
[1:28:44] just wanted to come back and get his
[1:28:46] status back and be back preaching like
[1:28:49] he used to. So, you can't do that.
[1:28:55] It's a It's pitiful now to see where his
[1:28:58] life ended up.
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:02] It ended up he's doing life sentence for
[1:29:06] murder.
[1:29:12] It's something about
[1:29:16] being humble and being obedient.
[1:29:20] Going down that road. Two young men
[1:29:23] loving the Lord, walking the streets
[1:29:25] together.
[1:29:28] One was humble enough to be obedient.
[1:29:33] The other one
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:37] until somebody got to him,
[1:29:42] listen to the wrong voice.
[1:29:45] You must you must be careful who you
[1:29:46] listen to.
[1:29:50] person that's concerned about you and
[1:29:51] care about you. As he said, listen to
[1:29:54] your parents to care and love you,
[1:29:58] but others will come in and try to tell
[1:30:00] you to listen
[1:30:03] to another voice.
[1:30:06] So many times I I said, "Lord,
[1:30:11] every time I think about that, I say,
[1:30:14] you can be so close to heaven, so close
[1:30:17] to
[1:30:18] God, and then it don't take but a
[1:30:21] little. It could have been any one of
[1:30:24] us.
[1:30:26] But thank God for his mercy that you can
[1:30:28] sit in the house of the Lord.
[1:30:32] Listen to your parents. Listen to those
[1:30:34] that love you and showing that they care
[1:30:37] about you.
[1:30:39] Don't let an outsider come and tell you
[1:30:43] that you're more than what
[1:30:47] because people know how to lift you up.
[1:30:51] But when you get in this shape that
[1:30:53] you're in,
[1:30:54] those people are nowhere to be found.
[1:30:59] God bless you this morning.
[1:31:03] Thank God for a young man holding on.
[1:31:07] He's in his 60s now. That probably 40ome
[1:31:10] years ago,
[1:31:14] but he's still holding on.
[1:31:18] As one fell by the other wayside, the
[1:31:21] other one still holding on. So young
[1:31:25] people in high school, you can make
[1:31:27] straight A's.
[1:31:31] You can hold on to the Lord and live a
[1:31:33] Christian life
[1:31:35] and God will bless you.
[1:31:40] And if you want to be blessed, obey God.
[1:31:44] Cuz that other road, listen to the wrong
[1:31:47] voice.
[1:31:50] I've seen countless numbers. I preached
[1:31:52] in a lot of prisons and I look at the
[1:31:54] young men
[1:31:56] and they said
[1:31:59] as I listen to them they cry sometimes
[1:32:02] when I was counseling and sat down with
[1:32:05] them and they cried and in tears just
[1:32:08] made their own decision
[1:32:11] young women and they just
[1:32:16] in tears.
[1:32:18] Why? Because they listen to the wrong
[1:32:20] voice.
[1:32:24] Some of them I felt so sorry for.
[1:32:28] One young man, he was in med school. He
[1:32:30] says,
[1:32:33] he said, "I want to get back in med
[1:32:34] school. Can you help me?
[1:32:37] I made the wrong choice.
[1:32:40] Just
[1:32:42] sometimes it's just one mistake
[1:32:45] and you lose everything that you gain.
[1:32:48] I can tell you about so many stories. So
[1:32:50] many young people I've talked to in the
[1:32:53] prison,
[1:32:54] made the wrong decisions.
[1:32:58] Some got out, they're ministers.
[1:33:02] Some got out, they married ministers.
[1:33:05] But as a whole,
[1:33:07] the cycle continues.
[1:33:13] Don't you go down that wrong road.
[1:33:16] Be obedient
[1:33:18] and let God bless you. Let us stand.
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:26] Thank you for everyone coming. God bless
[1:33:28] you, sister. Glad you brought young man.
[1:33:31] Thank you for coming. Amen. I hope you
[1:33:33] come back. Praise God. God bless you.
[1:33:36] Let us bow.
[1:33:39] Father, in the precious name of Jesus
[1:33:41] Christ,
[1:33:43] Lord, we thank you for your grace and
[1:33:45] mercy.
[1:33:47] Thank you for the opportunity to come
[1:33:48] into your house. As you said, I was glad
[1:33:51] when he said unto me, let us go into the
[1:33:54] house of the Lord.
[1:33:56] Father, I thank you for your word today.
[1:34:00] And Lord, I pray that
[1:34:04] you, oh God, will be with
[1:34:07] each and every one of your children,
[1:34:12] Lord God, that you would
[1:34:14] touch lives. Help us all to be obedient,
[1:34:17] Lord.
[1:34:19] Sometimes, Lord, in life, we'll in the
[1:34:22] valley of decisions.
[1:34:24] Sometimes we're in crossroads of our
[1:34:26] lives, but in the crossroads and in the
[1:34:30] valley decision, help us to make the
[1:34:32] right choice.
[1:34:34] Lord, help us to hold to God's
[1:34:36] unchanging hand.
[1:34:40] Lord, we thank God for brother Dwayne
[1:34:42] holding on
[1:34:44] all these years
[1:34:47] to continue
[1:34:49] serving the Lord and being witness
[1:34:55] Lord God, we laid hands on him as a
[1:34:58] young man and desired to minister the
[1:35:02] gospel, Lord, and he held on, Lord.
[1:35:07] Father, I pray that these young people
[1:35:09] as a whole here today
[1:35:12] give their life to you.
[1:35:16] And Lord, they make a confession. Lord,
[1:35:19] I want to be obedient.
[1:35:21] obedient to my parents, obedient to the
[1:35:24] word.
[1:35:25] How about you, friend, brother, sister?
[1:35:28] Do you want to be obedient? Just lift
[1:35:31] your hand. Tell God, I want to be
[1:35:33] obedient. Obedience to your word. I want
[1:35:36] to hear your voice. I want you to lead
[1:35:37] me. I want you to guide me. God, I want
[1:35:40] you to have your way in my life, Father.
[1:35:43] For I need you every hour. Need you
[1:35:45] every day.
[1:35:47] God bless your children now.
[1:35:50] Thank you for Lord being so good and so
[1:35:53] real.
[1:35:55] Bless your children now
[1:35:59] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. The race is not given
[1:36:08] to the swift.
[1:36:11] Amen.
[1:36:13] The battle to the strong.
[1:36:16] But I want you to know
[1:36:19] as those that are do it to the end, the
[1:36:22] same shall be saved.
[1:36:25] It's not how intelligent we are, not how
[1:36:27] smart you are, but it's just the grace
[1:36:30] of God that causes us to stand. And I
[1:36:34] thank God for his grace. Listen to what
[1:36:37] you've heard. Look at somebody said,
[1:36:40] listen to what you heard and take heed.
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:47] Amen. God is good. God bless every one
[1:36:50] of you. Thank you for coming again. God
[1:36:52] bless you in Jesus name.
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:56] [Applause]
