[33:27] 19 and 23.
[33:31] we thank god amen
[33:36] god's uh spoke on my redeemer
[33:40] liveth amen so by the grace of god we
[33:43] want to talk about
[33:45] the redeemer this morning knowing that
[33:48] he has redeemed you and i
[33:50] we've been brought back
[33:54] purchased by his blood 23
[33:59] 19 and 23.
[34:05] oh that my words were not written
[34:09] oh that they were printed
[34:12] in a book that they were
[34:16] graven with an iron pen
[34:19] and lead in the rock
[34:22] forever for i know
[34:27] that my redeemer liveth
[34:30] and that he shall stand
[34:33] [Music]
[34:35] at the latter day upon the earth
[34:39] and though after
[34:42] my skin worms destroyed this body
[34:48] yet my flesh shall
[34:54] yet in my flesh shall i
[34:57] see god whom i shall see
[35:01] for myself and my eyes shall be whole
[35:06] and not another though my
[35:10] reigns be consumed within me
[35:13] may god bless you word you may be seated
[35:19] praise god as we look at the book of job
[35:25] we understand that job had
[35:28] some troubles
[35:31] amen so the book of job tell us a man
[35:34] that is born of a woman
[35:36] full of trouble
[35:39] talking this morning but i know
[35:44] my redeemer liveth
[35:47] and my sub topic is the purpose of god
[35:52] the purpose of god
[35:57] god made you and i
[36:00] and i believe that we were wonderfully
[36:03] made
[36:05] god made us in his own image after his
[36:08] own likeness
[36:11] and when god made the world and his
[36:14] creation he said it was good
[36:17] but we understand when we spoke on life
[36:19] last week that sin got in
[36:22] sin caused death
[36:27] but this morning we said that in that
[36:30] sin
[36:30] has caused death
[36:33] the writer said we were sold to sin
[36:40] amen our sin had
[36:43] amen caused this whole body to
[36:48] decay in rotten
[36:53] man had lost
[36:57] that fellowship that he had with god
[37:02] sin had entered in brother and sister
[37:08] so there was a separation from
[37:12] god we lost that communion
[37:18] in that god his god and god
[37:22] had a plan god has a purpose
[37:27] and god has a plan
[37:30] and because god is god and he's
[37:34] omnipotent
[37:38] and he's on nice science and he knows
[37:40] everything
[37:43] he's all powerful
[37:46] the bible says he knows the end from the
[37:48] beginning
[37:51] they meant so god knew amen what was
[37:54] going to happen
[37:55] before it happens
[38:00] god has a purpose and god
[38:04] has a plan doesn't matter how
[38:08] dark things get
[38:12] god got a purpose and god has a plan
[38:19] in the book of romans 8 i'll just read
[38:22] one verse i think i went over that
[38:24] concerning life
[38:27] romans 8
[38:31] sometimes we don't understand what god
[38:36] is doing and
[38:39] sometimes we lose hope
[38:44] sometimes we give up we don't understand
[38:48] as though life has dealt us a bad hand
[38:54] and we don't know how to uh conduct
[38:58] ourselves and we don't know amen how to
[39:01] go about everyday life because
[39:04] it gets kind of chaotic sometimes
[39:08] we're in a world that uh as it said in
[39:11] the last days
[39:13] perilous times dangerous times will come
[39:20] as we see this pandemic as we see
[39:24] amen the the protesters in the killings
[39:27] and
[39:28] even the shootings and all of that going
[39:31] on
[39:34] see man is not getting closer to god man
[39:38] it's getting farther
[39:39] away from god
[39:43] man is trying to come up with a solution
[39:46] to the chaos and the injustice that's
[39:49] going on in society
[39:51] man is trying to say we need justice
[39:57] amen but man does not understand what
[40:00] justice is because it's too much amen
[40:03] control
[40:04] amen by the enemy and if as long as
[40:08] satan exists
[40:09] there's going to be chaos and confusion
[40:13] as long as sin is in the world
[40:17] amen there's going to be every strife
[40:20] and jealousy and hatred
[40:22] amen we can't get rid of it doesn't
[40:25] matter what
[40:26] amen man do amen he can't get rid of
[40:30] prejudice and hatred and of violence and
[40:34] killings and modern you can't get rid of
[40:37] it
[40:39] because that's what sin caused
[40:43] amen sin calls all the chaos and
[40:46] all this the confusion and things that

[52:21] understand what life amen is taking
[52:24] what what journey that we're passing
[52:27] through
[52:28] amen but in that amen what he was going
