heart's desires Lord all those that are here all those that are on their way and those that are not here Lord bless them in their absence in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning we'll turn to the Book of John chapter 5 John chapter 5 and we'll start reading at the first verse and when you got it say amen amen that's a little weak we going to wait John CH 5 verse one it reads and after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and there and now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market upon pole which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of important folk of blind and halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had infirmity for 38 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wil thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step is down before me and Jesus said sayith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath amen God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled your day of Victory your day of Victory when you read this story you see that this man was troubled for 38 years he had been in the same situation for 38 years but one day Jesus came and stopped by one day Jesus came and he heard his cry he heard his prayer it didn't matter how long he was there his healing was going away it didn't matter how long he might have sat there he said he might have had excuses he said other people help they friends into the pool but you see he didn't need no help all he needed was Jesus he didn't need nobody else to help him all he had to do was wait and God came by and provided what he asked him for it was his Day of Victory it was his day that he was going to get delivered it was his day that God was going to set him free he didn't know when that day was coming but he was in the right place at the right time you can't get Victory unless you're in the right place at the right time and when you in the right place at the right time it's going to be your day of Victory it's going to be your moment of Victory doesn't matter how long it took but it was the right place at the right time and I said I wrote something down I said sometimes your Victory is in letting go amen he had to get out of the place that he had to worry about this one helping that one he had to worry about this one helping this one get in the pool before him he let all that go and he took his healing when Jesus said rise up and walk he didn't question it he got up and he walked he didn't he didn't wonder whether this was it or whether it not was he took it by faith and said this is mine This Is My Day of Victory and I'm going to step forth and rejoice it's my day of Victory he didn't care what day of the week it was he didn't care who was around him he didn't care about everybody else that was sick that was sitting there he said this is my Day of Victory amen and I started to think about it and I said how many times do we pass up our Victory because we looking at all the other things how many times do we pass up Victory because we looking at everyone else around us and expecting them to go with us it wasn't for everybody but it was for him amen it wasn't for his friend that might have been I'm sure after 38 years he had made some friends after 38 years he had made some some people that he had seen get healed and maybe they came back and checked on them but he wasn't worried about them in that moment it was for him and he said you know what it's time for me to rise up and walk it's time for me to go forth and step into my victory it's time for me to realize that this is my day that the Lord has made and I can rejoice and be glad in it see he was was happy that that was his day cuzz he had been there and he realized that this is something that it doesn't matter how long it take when that angel troubled that water I could get in and I could be healed but when Jesus stopped by I don't have to wait on the water to be trouble when Jesus comes by I don't have to wait on seeing the water Rumble I don't have to wait on the others all I can do is take what God has given me and I can go for it and say this is my day and it might not be your testimony but I can say this is my day it may not be your testimony but I can say this is the day that God has given me for victory and I can go forward and I can shout the victory because I know God is going to do what he said he was going to do I know that God has given me what I asked him for I know that God is moving what I asked him for and it didn't matter how long it's going to take but I know God has done it cuz this is my Day of Victory I thought about it and I and I said that I was reading in Exodus 14-14 it said the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen I I read that scripture and I had to read it again because I said I read the Bible but sometimes it hit different I said the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace am Exodus 14-4 and I thought about I said sometimes you over there fighting and you ain't holding your peace you over there saying this and that but you not holding your peace the scripture said the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace which means sometimes you got to be silent when God is working amen you can't tell nobody when God is working you can't utter the prayer cuz the devil might hear it and mess it up you can't even tell nobody what you done told God in your secret room he said the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and I said sometimes you got to cast all your cares on him because he cares for you and when you cast them all down you can see the Lord fighting for you you can see the Lord do what you asked him to do and to see him work and I said see this is your day of Victory but do you believe it all it takes is you believ in it and just because the Mountain Ain't move ain't doesn't mean that you didn't speak to the mountain it didn't mean that the mountain wasn't moving just cuz you didn't see it move just because it didn't happen before your eyes didn't mean that mountain wasn't moving you never know it could be a grain of sand by a grain of sand but when the grain of Sands moved something was taking place something was out of the ordinary was going on because there was something that you spoke and you believed and God was doing the work and when God decide that he wants to complete the work he will complete the work cuz I can tell you God Is Never Too Late God is never too late he's never too late in what he's going to do and when he does it you can't profess that you did it when God does a thing you can't say that it was something that this one or that one did all you know is that I thank God I thank God for what you done and said you can't deliver me but God can you can't save me but God can you can't heal me but God can and when you get to that reality things start changing for you cuz you know that all my Help Cometh From The Lord all my help I can look up to the hills from cometh my help cuz my help comes from the Lord I was reading reading something he said don't despise where God has got you but serve your purpose there's coming a great Victory Day one of these days where the Battle Is Over amen I said sometimes we think about we despise where we are we despise where we are cuz we think well we should be here or we should be there or I shouldn't I should be this place or that place and I and I said something to someone recently and I was I was talking and and we was going through some things I said sometimes we always looking back to where God did things in the past because it's a momento it's something that we can look at and see the salvation of the Lord the children of Israel always could go back to Egypt but if they always looking at Egypt they would never cross Jordan they always looking at the miracle of the Red Sea they would never expect the Jordan the crossover Jordan but in Jordan it was greater there was a blessed Land There was a land that was flowing with milk and honey where God had defeated all their enemies all they had to do was believe and said you always sometimes you despise the where God has got you but realize that God got you right there amen and you wouldn't be there if God didn't have his hand over your life and had put you there and if he put you there he had a reason for you to be there he had a reason for you to go through it and because he wanted to build you for a greater purpose see he can't give you a greater purpose if you don't have Victory you can't testify if you don't have Victory you can't tell nobody how good God is if you never experienced how good God is if you never experienced what God has done that's where the testimony comes from when God brings you through and you can testify and look back and say it was nobody but God that could bring me through what I've been through and I can count up the victories that God has given me and sometimes you have to pray for others that they can overcome you have to stand in the Gap that they can overcome But realize that you know what sometime you got to let down those burdens to God you got to come to the cross and say Lord I give you these things otherwise they will weigh down your journey amen they will weigh you down and you over here carrying burdens that aren't yours and when you realize that and the Revelation comes to you that Lord in order for me to get Victory I got to lay some things down amen you'll go to God real quick real quick because you don't you know what freedom is you've experienced what God has done and you know that these are things that I I I don't want to deal with and continue to carry on with me for the rest of my life and sometimes you don't know the weights that you carry until you go to God and say Lord take the weights away yeah and God open your eyes that you may see Lord I was carrying a whole lot of stuff I was caring a whole lot of stuff that I was supposed to say casting all my cares on you but I I cast them down and I picked them right back up when I left said the the hard the easy thing is to cast them down but do you pick them back up see you ain't got Victory then you just picked up your problem with you you got a feeling and a joy that happened for a moment but when you get true Victory it it's something different when you get true Victory and when you know that you not going to go through that no more and if you do when the Devil Comes you got something to stand on and say nuh-uh devil this ain't for me and I'm giving it right back to you see that's what victory is Victory a doesn't mean that you're not going to be tested again Victory doesn't mean that the trial ain't going to come again it means that when the trial comes I can shout and thank God that this devil is not going to attack me no more devil you fought me yesterday but you ain't going to win today that's what victory means but you know when you get that Revelation then you will understand what true Victory is said the victory ain't just a feeling it's not an emotion it's something deep down in the inside where you know that God has done the work and no matter how hard the devil tried he can't take me back to where I once was he can't take me back to bondage he can't take me back to being under the Philistines he can't they can't conquer me no more cuz God gave me Victory see that's Victory amen and when you decide that you want it you can go to God and say Lord I need Victory say sometimes you got to go to God and say Lord I need peace you got to go to God and say Lord I need peace and you don't know how that peace is coming but you said Lord I need peace and I'm telling you when you ask God for peace sometimes God will give you peace yeah but it may not be how you expected it to come boy Lord Jesus it may not be how you expected it to come but when it comes you'll realize it was exactly what I prayed for amen yes it was exactly what I prayed for sometimes you praying prayers and God be answering the prayers I said man I got to um be careful what to pray for because when God start answering you realize that you got to be specific with your prayers and the more God work on you and touch you and and realize you get real specific with the prayers because you want God to make sure that Lord not my will but thy will be done and you start to praying different you start to come in even when you call people names you start to pray IND different Lord I want your will to be done not mine when you start to praying for other people you start to say Lord I want you to have your way in their life not mine I could imagine this and that and this and that but Lord I want you to give them Victory when you realize that you put them in God's hands and you put them in God's hands and you leave them in God's hands right you expecting the work to happen you expecting God to do what you asked him to do and you left them there you ain't worried about it you ain't crying about it no more you ain't you trusting God and say Lord when you do the work I can testify that you've done it and I I don't even have to see it but I know that you going to do it amen see that's what it takes when you get that type of Victory boy it allow you to shout all over the place it allow you to be so free and say thank you Jesus ain't nothing can hinder you or stop you from believing in what God can do it said it says and it seems like the Christian Life if a fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like holds so many disappointments sometimes people are disappointed with their Christian life but they're not living like a Christian so how can you be mad at God when you ain't doing what God asked you to do how can you be upset with God not doing things for you when you ain't doing what God asked you to do I don't understand it cuz God a ask for much he didn't ask for much he just said give me give me your life and then he said if you get in trouble just lift up your hand and I'll lift you out that's all he asked for he said some people it seems like the Christian Life is if it's not centered on Christ seems like it holds so many disappointments but those disappointments are God's Divine God's Divine will happening for us even with all the disappointments it was God's will divine will happening for us yes God to take you through things that you never thought or imagine you would go through but it was his Divine will for it to happen to you and said now it don't seem like it would be it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he let us hit this hit the river to see what we'll do God will let you hit the river just to see what you going to do God will let you run into a brick wall to see what you going to do God let let you and sometimes he knew the brick wall was coming and he tried to warn you that the brick wall was coming but he still let you go cuz some things you can avoid and Escape because people done told you and they warned you and God sent people in your life to testify and to tell you but when you go through it it was still God's will for you to do it if you were his child sometimes he got to take you through the fiery trials and a fiery furnace the Hebrew children didn't get to escape going the Hebrew boys get to escape going in that furnace it was just that God was going to show up and they weren going to be burned they didn't get to escape it those around them died because of the heat but they didn't get to escape it God had to take them through it and I and I and I was thought about I said you know Jesus Jesus gave up The Ghost and he died for us so that all of us could be saved you think that was easy but that was his moment of victory for us that was when he won he defeated death Hell In The Grave Just For Us just for me and you he did all of that that was the Day of Victory and I can always turn back and say that was my day of Victory cuz I was there when he died on the cross for me I was there and he shed his blood for me it was my sins that was on that cross when he was getting whipped and he was getting beat and those Thrones of they was pushing them down on his head those were my sins those were were my mistakes those were the time where I knew better and God G gave me grace and mercy that I can still live and breathe and that he gave me those moments to repent that was me on that cross that God died for if you don't understand that or if you haven't realized that today can be your day of victory that you can turn around and say Lord your blood was shed for me Lord when you died you died for me amen not anybody else I can see my sins on that cross and it wasn't greater than your sins or less or higher or more than your sins and I can't judge you because I have to be judged by who what the way that I judge but I can't judge you because I'm right there with you I'm no greater than anybody else just because this person may have done a heinous crime and all you did was told a lie which one of y'all going to get into heaven if you don't get it straight neither one of y'all because you haven't come to the blood where Jesus where the Lord doesn't see your sins and doesn't see you he sees Jesus he sees him standing in the Gap and he said that's my son and whom I'm well pleased see that's what you want to hear but just because you think that I live a semide decent life I'm okay just because I don't do this that and the other I'm okay I only did a little bit of sin and they did a whole lot it ain't that ain't the measure we we all going to get judged by the same thing when we come there and we see the Lord he going to say what have you done with the life I gave youen what have you done but today you can get victory over everything that you may face everything that you may go through everything every trial and tribulation that may come God can give you victory over no matter how hard it is no matter how difficult it may seem it might have been things that you fighting that ain't even your thing it was generational things and God can give you Victory today God can give you victory over that the generational things that you have to go to God and say Lord this ain't even my fight but I'm dealing with it because of generational things I had to go to God and say Lord give me victory over this whether it's mind battles whether it's it's things that people can physically see you know the Unseen things are worse than the things that you can't see amen bless him Lord the things that you fight in the middle of the night that nobody knows about sometimes those are harder than the things that people can see amen yes because nobody knows the struggle that go that you have in your mind but when God knows everything and he saw you and he sees you and he knows what you go through I may not know sister brother mama or daddy may not know but God knows and when he can come by and give you victory over that and when he gives you victory over that there's a whole lot of things that may go away because God Gave You Victory amen amen but the question is do you want it Victory could be given to you but do you want it it was a gift am God just say I want to give it to you freely if you want it today you can have it but do you want it no matter how much someone may tell you or preach to you or speak to you or testify to you if you don't want that you will never get it but you will never be able to go to God in that day and say somebody didn't tell me am you won't be able to go to God in that day and say somebody didn't didn't testify to me or somebody didn't speak to me and tell me what God was and how good he was and that he died for me amen that's not like like pilate said I wash my hands and it's on you see God give you everything that you ask him for if it's your need he didn't say he'll give you your wants but he give you your needs but today is the day that you can get Victory amen today is your day that you can walk out and be free amen amen and I don't know what you may go through or what you may be going through but today is the day that you can say Lord I am free and just because it don't happen in the moment that you pray don't mean it ain't going to happen the prophet of God he prayed for someone and it took him leaving the leaving the service going back to two place and testifying every day that I'm Healed I'm Healed he didn't stop testifying that he was healed when he got prayed for cuz he believed it wasn't until he was sitting in a barber chair and the barber was like you said you went there and got prayed for and you still ain't healed that God had to be a testimony for that barber in that day to show him that he was healed and his eyes popped open am it was because of his testimony that he continued to believe even though he didn't see his eyes open he didn't see color he didn't see anything he was still blind but when he testified that he was healed he was healed and he had to continue to believe that I'm Healed he had to continue to believe that I'm delivered I'm I'm set free from the bondage that's holding me see he was at rest he was at peace because he knew
