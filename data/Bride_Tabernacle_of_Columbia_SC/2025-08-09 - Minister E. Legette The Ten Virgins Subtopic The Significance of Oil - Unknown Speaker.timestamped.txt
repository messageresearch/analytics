[31:45] in a word of prayer. Amen. You have a
[31:47] special need, you can make it known by
[31:49] lifting up your hands.
[31:51] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you
[31:53] this evening, Lord, as humble as we know
[31:55] how, God, to say thank you, Lord, for
[31:58] your grace, Lord. Thank you for all your
[32:00] mercy,
[32:02] &gt;&gt; oh God, towards us, Lord. We just thank
[32:04] you, Lord, for bringing us through
[32:05] another week. And, oh God, keeping us by
[32:08] your divine power, Lord. We thank you
[32:10] for that tonight, Lord. We pray, oh God,
[32:13] that you would speak to our hearts just
[32:15] now, Lord. And that your Holy Spirit,
[32:18] God, would come in this place.
[32:20] God, I know it will because you said
[32:22] where two or three are gathered in my
[32:24] name that there I'd be in the midst. And
[32:26] God, we just thank you for that tonight.
[32:28] Lord, we pray, oh God, that you would
[32:30] bless your children, oh God, that if we
[32:32] said or did anything that wasn't like
[32:34] you, Lord, and oh God, that you would
[32:37] forgive us and you would help us, oh
[32:39] God, to be reconciled to you, Lord, that
[32:42] we can hear from thee tonight, Lord. We
[32:44] just thank you for your grace. Thank you
[32:46] for all of your mercy towards us. bless
[32:49] us just now. Bless those that are here,
[32:51] those that had a desire to come. Lord,
[32:53] the sick and afflicted. May you watch
[32:56] over them as well tonight. Lord, we
[32:58] thank you. We love you. We appreciate
[33:00] you for all of your goodness and your
[33:02] grace. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[33:04] pray. Amen. Amen.
[33:07] God is good. Amen. We want to look at
[33:10] the book of Matthew, the 25th chapter.
[33:12] By the grace of God.
[33:14] Amen.
[33:16] [Music]
[33:18] Matthew 25 and we'll begin at the first
[33:21] verse. Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[33:28] Mighty good.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 25 and and we'll begin at
[33:34] the first verse. If you got it, say
[33:36] amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Then shall the
[33:39] kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10
[33:41] virgins which took their lamps and went
[33:44] forth to meet the bridegroom. And five
[33:46] of them were wise, and five were
[33:48] foolish. They that were wise took their
[33:51] lamps and took they that were foolish
[33:54] took their lamps and took no oil with
[33:56] them. But the wise took oil in their
[33:59] vessels and with took oil in their
[34:03] vessels with their lamps." You may be
[34:04] seated. We read a little further down
[34:08] the fifth verse. It says, "While the
[34:10] bridegroom terried,
[34:12] they all slumbered and slept. And at
[34:15] midnight there was a cry made, behold,
[34:17] the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet
[34:20] him." Then all those virgins arose and
[34:23] trimmed their lamps. And the foolish
[34:25] said unto the wise, "Give us of your
[34:27] oil, for our lamps are gone out." But
[34:30] the wise answer, saying, Not so, lest
[34:35] there be not enough for us and you. But
[34:38] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[34:41] for yourselves. And while they went to
[34:43] buy, the bridegroom came, and they that
[34:46] were ready went in with him to the
[34:48] marriage, and the door was shut. After
[34:51] came afterward came also the other
[34:54] virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
[34:57] But he answered and said, "Verily I say
[35:00] unto you, I know you not where watch
[35:03] therefore for ye know neither the day
[35:07] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[35:10] cometh." May God have blessed the
[35:11] reading of his word. Tonight by the
[35:13] grace of God just for a moment, I want
[35:16] to minister on a little something I was
[35:17] ministering on this week and I entitled
[35:20] it the 10 virgins. Amen. And the
[35:23] subtitle subtopic the significance of
[35:27] the oil. Amen. The significance of the
[35:30] oil. You know, I don't I don't think
[35:32] here as we're saying the other day is
[35:35] just a coincidence that you know Jesus
[35:38] when he was talking about this parable,
[35:40] he brought it as as it was in the
[35:44] midnight hour. Amen.
[35:46] Because in the midnight hour, we know
[35:48] what the midnight signifies. is the one
[35:50] of going to be the darkest time of the
[35:52] day, right? Or the darkest the darkest
[35:55] time. And I know that you know where we
[35:58] where we're living in, you can feel the
[36:00] effects of the darkness today. Amen.
[36:04] Anybody with any any little spiritual
[36:07] about them can sense the darkness of the
[36:09] hour that we live in. You know, where
[36:11] the Bible declared that it would be that
[36:13] way that as it was in the days of Noah,
[36:15] so it would be today. where the men's
[36:18] heart was on evil, right? Evil
[36:21] continually. You find that even those
[36:23] that declare to have a little bit of
[36:26] religion, right? Their minds are even
[36:29] are are even uh on evil continually,
[36:32] right? They can't help themselves. So,
[36:34] we find that, you know, that's the hour
[36:36] that we live in. The Bible talked about
[36:38] in believe in the book of Isaiah, he was
[36:40] saying, "Arise and shine for thy light
[36:42] has come. The glory of the Lord is risen
[36:45] upon thee." Cuz in that hour he was
[36:47] saying that it was going to be darkness
[36:49] was going to cover the earth, right? Not
[36:51] only darkness going to cover the earth,
[36:53] but it says gross darkness was going to
[36:55] cover the people. So we living in an
[36:57] hour like we said of of darkness,
[36:59] midnight, right? But in that very hour
[37:03] Jesus here as he is talking this parable
[37:06] here,
[37:07] that very hour of the midnight hour,
[37:10] that would be the hour that he would
[37:12] call for his bride. Right? So you know
[37:15] as we see the the signs of the time
[37:19] right sometimes we wonder is it just is
[37:23] it just you as an individual or does the
[37:26] world really see the hour that we live
[37:28] in right many times I believe that the
[37:32] world itself they see it but they want
[37:34] to put it on the backside right because
[37:36] they want to see it as not happening
[37:39] things not taking place in our lifetime
[37:41] but for another time right or are You'll
[37:44] have those that, you know, we was
[37:46] looking at like the signs of of of the
[37:48] hour that we live in. You know, I was
[37:50] looking at how the the earthquake hit
[37:52] over there the other other week and and
[37:54] we were at we were on the job looking at
[37:56] like look a 8.8 just hit, right? And
[37:59] they calling for tsunamis, right?
[38:01] Worldwide effect looked like it was
[38:04] going to happen, right? But then we
[38:06] looked at videos of the people. You know
[38:08] what everybody was doing? They got their
[38:10] phones and their cameras and everybody
[38:12] headed to the coast to video this thing
[38:15] to see it coming. One lady said, "I went
[38:18] and got my grandson cuz this is a once-
[38:20] ina-lifetime event that he'll be able to
[38:22] see it." But what it is, I says, "The
[38:25] world has gone what? Insane, ain't it?
[38:28] They don't really believe that the
[38:30] judgments of God are hitting the earth,
[38:33] right? And that's why they act." We saw
[38:35] some of them, the surfers, they grabbed
[38:38] their surfboard, says they going to ride
[38:40] these waves.
[38:42] They couldn't wait. They said 30 foot,
[38:44] 50 foot, whatever. They wanted the
[38:46] highest waves to come in so they can say
[38:48] they surf those waves, right? I says
[38:51] that shows you the mind frame of the
[38:54] world, right?
[38:55] &gt;&gt; So, as we look at what are we dealing
[38:57] with? So, we dealing with a world that's
[39:00] gone insane.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Aren't we?
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then they look at you as
[39:06] something is wrong with you because God
[39:08] has kept your minds.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; The thing about it is I'm glad that God
[39:12] is, you know, and it's only by his
[39:14] grace. That's what we got to realize.
[39:16] It's only by the grace of God that he's
[39:19] keeping your mind sane because everybody
[39:22] wants to go one way, right? But yet by
[39:25] his spirit, he's keeping you another
[39:27] way, right?
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So I said, you know, it's a dark hour we
[39:31] live in, right? As I was meditating on
[39:34] this this uh sermon here and then I woke
[39:37] up and found a scene that where Russia
[39:39] said a earthquake that been ly not
[39:42] earthquake but a volcano that was lying
[39:44] dormant for 600 years. Now it decide it
[39:47] won't erupt. It erupt right and they
[39:50] said they think it might have been
[39:52] caused by the tsunamis. What it is the
[39:54] scripture came to my mind that the the
[39:56] earth is is is groaning right and
[39:59] travail and birth pains right until now.
[40:02] Now, what is it doing? It's waiting to
[40:03] be released from the bondage that it was
[40:05] put in, right? What put it in bondage?
[40:08] Because a man disobeyed God, right? Sin
[40:11] got it in that condition. And it knows
[40:14] that that ain't the normal condition,
[40:15] right?
[40:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that the it's getting tired,
[40:19] ain't it? Tired of men pulling all this
[40:22] resource out of, doing all this sin,
[40:23] getting and it ain't getting no better.
[40:25] It's getting wicider. Right? But I says
[40:27] today when you talk like that, people at
[40:30] job, people everywhere you go, they they
[40:32] look at you and they want to criticize
[40:34] you and say all this. But one thing
[40:36] about it, they don't want to uh uh uh uh
[40:38] come to the grips, especially with
[40:40] America that America is gone, right?
[40:45] Come on. And one day she going to have
[40:47] to pay for her sins.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Call it a righteous nation.
[40:51] Call it whatever you want. But I I was
[40:54] te telling somebody the other day, I see
[40:56] pears on that tree. It's not an apple
[40:58] tree. Come on.
[41:01] I see watermelons. It ain't cantaloupe.
[41:04] No matter what you say, it is what it
[41:06] is, ain't it? Come on. But will they
[41:08] repent? They can't repent if they don't
[41:10] they don't believe that they're doing
[41:12] anything wrong. Right? And that's what
[41:14] it is. Blindness. The Bible declared
[41:17] that in this hour that the world would
[41:19] be what? be be he said you say are rich
[41:22] increased with goods have need of what
[41:24] nothing but won't know the real
[41:27] condition they in right but what it
[41:30] takes that's what it is God ain't we
[41:32] looking for big groups God is knocking
[41:34] on the hearts of individuals I believe
[41:37] that he's dealing with you as an
[41:39] individual knocking on your heart do you
[41:40] hear him knocking
[41:42] &gt;&gt; come on do you see the signs of the time
[41:45] and it's real now
[41:47] &gt;&gt; everybody ain't going to get in
[41:48] desperation you say hey that out to put
[41:50] them in desperation. People ain't
[41:51] getting in desperation. But what it is
[41:53] when God things happening shaking you,
[41:56] what is it doing? You're not you're
[41:57] you're not afraid of like that because
[42:00] you realize one thing that God is going
[42:02] to keep his promise.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. That in these times I'mma look
[42:06] up because my redemption is drawing
[42:08] nigh. But one thing I am going to do,
[42:10] I'm going to make sure I got enough oil
[42:12] to make it through this night.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's be the significance,
[42:17] right? The Bible declared that it was 10
[42:20] virgins, wasn't it? And and they was
[42:23] virgins. They was all, I believe, like
[42:25] it say clean living people, right?
[42:27] Sanctified, right? But but the the the
[42:31] the the difference was was the all,
[42:34] right? Come on. What did that oil? The
[42:37] oil signified the Holy Ghost.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Clean living people, good
[42:42] church people, right? But the importance
[42:46] got to be this the significance got to
[42:48] be the all means everything to you.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. Y'all believe that the oil is
[42:54] everything.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what it is. God, I I
[42:58] need more than just just to be cleaned
[43:00] up and washed out, but I need to be
[43:02] filled. Hallelujah.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And when they see this hour
[43:06] approaching, God, I want more.
[43:08] Hallelujah. I want more than just to say
[43:10] top me off. I want my cup to run over.
[43:12] Hallelujah. That's what's going to mean
[43:14] more than more than all the money you
[43:16] got, more than all the standings you
[43:18] got, more than all the quotes you can
[43:20] quote, more than all the everything you
[43:22] think, right? God, the oil going to mean
[43:24] everything, right? You know, the Bible
[43:26] says that when the when the bridegroom
[43:28] call, right? At midnight, there was a
[43:30] cry made. When they talked to those
[43:32] other virgin, the the five wives, they
[43:35] says, "Our lamps have gone out."
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:40] When they woke up, their lamps was gone
[43:42] out. They didn't have nothing left. Now,
[43:45] the Bible said, they said, "Our lamps
[43:46] have gone what? Out." Come on. You said
[43:50] they were going to church, but their
[43:51] lamps, you can go to church, but your
[43:53] lamp can be gone out. Come on. People
[43:56] don't want to reckon with that, but it's
[43:57] the truth anyhow, ain't it? Your lamp
[44:00] gone out. Come on. I says what it is.
[44:02] When you got enough oil, it'll last you
[44:05] more than just Friday night I jumped and
[44:07] I shouted, but Saturday I my lamp was
[44:09] gone out. Come on. No, but that oil is
[44:11] enough to last you Saturday, Sunday,
[44:14] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you got oil
[44:16] and it's burning every single day.
[44:18] Hallelujah.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I said, you know, one thing
[44:23] about it, you know, I was looking at
[44:26] something. I said, the significance of
[44:27] all, come on. I was I was looking at
[44:30] something about oil. I thought I thought
[44:32] this was this was stirring stirring to
[44:34] me. Amen. about the oil just how
[44:36] important oil is just in the natural oil
[44:39] is real important ain't it come on and
[44:42] that's what it is like Jesus was talking
[44:44] here I I said I don't believe it's just
[44:46] no significance that he just talking
[44:48] about the oil right when they went to
[44:50] sleep when they laid down that night
[44:52] that wise they knew that hey I got to
[44:55] have all right
[44:57] &gt;&gt; I got to have enough I ain't taking no
[44:59] chances
[45:01] come on people taking chances ain't they
[45:04] ain't taking no chances. He might call
[45:07] when I'm at my weakest moment, right?
[45:10] Hallelujah. He might call when I'm going
[45:13] through my worst trial. But when he
[45:15] calls, like the song said, I'll answer.
[45:18] Hallelujah.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Why? When he calls, I want to be able to
[45:21] get up and go meet that the challenge,
[45:23] right? I got enough oil to make it
[45:27] through. It's dark out there, but I
[45:29] believe my oil is enough to last through
[45:31] it. Hallelujah.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Come on. You know, I was
[45:35] thinking about pro Job the other day. I
[45:38] was reading the scriptures about Job and
[45:41] I said one thing about Job. I said all
[45:44] that Job was going through was because
[45:46] God had confidence in him. Come on. All
[45:50] that he was suffering. How was he to
[45:52] know all that he was going through is
[45:54] because God was proving to the devil
[45:56] that no matter what, Job going to be
[45:58] faithful.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't had no way to know
[46:03] that, did he? Yes, sir.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; But God was proving that because God
[46:06] knew that whatever Job had. Come on. Or
[46:10] whatever Job confidence and all what
[46:12] what Job I know that no matter what you
[46:14] do to him,
[46:16] what you put on his life, no matter how
[46:18] dark of an hour he going through, he
[46:21] going to stay faithful. Do what you want
[46:23] to him. I got confidence in him.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. You know, when you're
[46:29] going through your little trial and your
[46:30] storm, it might catch you unaware right
[46:33] from the beginning. But one thing I
[46:35] think about that no matter what, God,
[46:37] I'm going still trust you. No matter
[46:39] what, I'm going still love you. I'm
[46:41] going still faithful. Still still be
[46:43] faithful. And if I got things that I
[46:45] don't know about in my life, God, show
[46:47] me so I can make them right.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Because no matter what, I
[46:53] want to stay with you, God.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let everybody else go where
[46:58] they want, do what they want. God, I
[46:59] want to stay with you, Lord.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; You brought me. Hallelujah. From a
[47:04] mighty long way. Should have been dead.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. Should have been on drugs.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Should have been cast away by God.
[47:12] Hallelujah. Who was rich in mercy. Oh,
[47:16] hallelujah.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That's enough to love him all of my
[47:19] days.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:26] You know, one of the guys at work, they
[47:28] had a big debate the other day. It got
[47:30] kind of heated and I had to say, "Hey,
[47:32] hey y'all, let's just call stop. Hold
[47:35] on." Now, one of the guys got up and he
[47:37] walked out. One of the guys at work, he
[47:39] said, "Ernest, you know what the problem
[47:41] is?" He said, "That guy right there, he
[47:44] want to live his life like you live your
[47:46] life." He says, "How you don't smoke,
[47:49] you don't drink, you don't even indulge
[47:51] in the conversations. That's why we
[47:53] don't even talk about certain things
[47:54] around you because he said no matter
[47:56] what you real, right? He said that he he
[48:00] want to live his life like that so bad
[48:02] that he get mad with himself
[48:05] when when he makes mistakes, right? I
[48:08] said, but you know what? That's a good
[48:09] thing that people see your life and they
[48:12] want to be like you, right? I said, but
[48:14] you got to mark the perfect man, right?
[48:17] Which is Christ. I said, the thing about
[48:19] it is you can try all you want. You'll
[48:21] never be able to live this life because
[48:24] I can't live it. I said it ain't me, but
[48:26] it's what's inside of me. Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Right. It's living its life through me.
[48:31] You only seeing what's in me.
[48:32] Hallelujah.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; It ain't me. I tried before and I
[48:36] failed. But you got to realize that I
[48:38] can't do it. I need him to come.
[48:40] Hallelujah.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; He is the one that's living his life
[48:44] through me. So many people are trying
[48:46] and they failing and they get mad with
[48:49] everybody else around them, right? But
[48:51] what I say today, give it over to God.
[48:53] Hallelujah. Let God know I can't do it.
[48:56] God, I need you to come in. It's not me,
[48:59] but it's Christ that's living in me.
[49:00] Hallelujah. You see what you're seeing.
[49:03] It's only Oh, hallelujah. It's only God
[49:06] on the inside working on the outside,
[49:09] something inside. Hallelujah. Changing
[49:12] you. That's what it's got to be. That's
[49:15] why you can live freely. Hallelujah.
[49:17] That's why you can live. Why? Because
[49:19] it's him and you controlling you, right?
[49:22] He's got a little it's a little bumper
[49:23] in there. He'll check you. Hallelujah.
[49:25] You try to go too far right to the left,
[49:27] nobody ain't got to be there. You watch.
[49:29] Come on. He going to check you. Right.
[49:31] The inside teaches a bumper. Hey, you
[49:33] getting too far. Hey, you moving too
[49:35] far. Hey, get back. Get back.
[49:36] Hallelujah. It's him on the inside.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Keeping me in step. Hallelujah. Keeping
[49:42] me in line.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. That's what it is. That's why
[49:47] I got joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[49:49] Hallelujah.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; But what it is, it's God. How many
[49:55] believe that tonight? It is. It's so
[49:58] easy. Like they they got a little song.
[50:00] They say it's so easy to love him
[50:02] because he's wonderful. Hallelujah. It's
[50:05] so easy.
[50:07] It's so easy to serve God. Why is it so
[50:09] easy to serve God? Cuz once he come in,
[50:10] Hallelujah. And he begin to open up your
[50:13] eyes to all the all the things, right?
[50:16] The blessings they come freely, right?
[50:18] With the trials come blessings. You
[50:21] understand that I'm only going through
[50:23] Hallelujah. God is taking me through.
[50:25] Somebody was somebody was talking to me
[50:26] the other week. They was telling me
[50:28] about all they going through. And then
[50:30] when this happened after this, this this
[50:32] and that. And I started laughing. They
[50:34] said, "What's you know, they want to
[50:35] know what's funny?" I said, "You ain't
[50:37] going through nothing. Ain't nobody else
[50:39] been through." Come on. Everybody goes
[50:42] through that. It's just how you handle.
[50:43] See, one thing about it, when I'm going
[50:45] through it, I already know who Jehovah
[50:48] Gyra is. Hallelujah.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. He's Jehovah Gyra. Amen. He my
[50:53] When I'm going through, I ain't worried
[50:54] about it.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. Hallelujah. Jehovah Gyra,
[50:59] my provider. Come on. When I start
[51:02] feeling pain, come on. Jehovah Raf. Come
[51:04] on. Jehovah. All these. He's still that
[51:06] same God, ain't he?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; I like how he told Moses. He says, "You
[51:10] tell him that I am." Hallelujah. That's
[51:12] going to be my name throughout all the
[51:14] generations. Why? Because he ain't going
[51:16] to change. He's still all powerful. He's
[51:19] still the same God.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. And you got to believe that.
[51:23] People don't believe that today. That's
[51:25] why they go through the way they do.
[51:27] Hallelujah. But when you believe it,
[51:29] it's simple. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come
[51:32] on. God is good, ain't it?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. I says, "But what it is today,
[51:37] out of all the things, remember we said
[51:40] those virgins, they slumbered and slept,
[51:42] right? Come on. But when the crowd was
[51:44] made, come on.
[51:47] When it was time to get out of here,
[51:49] hallelujah. They all woke up, but some
[51:52] of them didn't have what it take to make
[51:54] it through it, did they?" But then I
[51:57] says the significance of the oil. I want
[51:58] to read this a little bit of this. It
[52:01] says you know in the natural just how
[52:04] important oil is says in the natural oil
[52:08] remains a crucial resource of the modern
[52:11] world is primarily as a fuel for
[52:14] transportation. It's a key ingredient to
[52:17] countless products
[52:19] says it fuels vehicles, heats our homes
[52:22] and is a foundation for many plastics,
[52:24] medicines and every and all other
[52:27] everyday items. While its dominance is
[52:30] being challenged by renewable energy
[52:32] sources, oil's impact on the global
[52:35] economy in daily life is still
[52:39] substantial. You know, I started
[52:41] thinking about how I didn't even realize
[52:44] oil, they use oil for just about
[52:46] everything. And that's why they're so
[52:48] afraid that one day, hallelujah, it
[52:51] might run out. So, what they trying to
[52:54] do, they're trying to do all they can to
[52:56] replace it. Come on, find something to
[52:58] replace it. But as I was just digging
[53:01] into this natural oil, hallelujah, and
[53:04] how important it is, I says, "But yet,
[53:06] people don't realize how important the
[53:08] spiritual oil is."
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. They don't realize that that
[53:12] that like it says that natural oil is
[53:14] substantial to all your daily life. They
[53:17] don't realize how much that spiritual
[53:19] oil is. Hallelujah.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's what gets me give me joy
[53:23] in the morning. It's what wakes me up in
[53:25] the evening. Come on. And it's what
[53:27] keeps me going from day to day. It's my
[53:29] necessary me. It's all that I'm going to
[53:31] need, right? Because you can even have
[53:33] the letter, but the letter will kill
[53:35] you. You got to have the spirit.
[53:36] Hallelujah. To quicken the letter to
[53:39] bring it to life.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; That is more than just what you reading.
[53:43] Hallelujah. But it's coming out the
[53:45] pages of the book. Hallelujah. It's
[53:47] alive. That's was what I live by.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't just telling you
[53:52] something that I'm just reading. But I
[53:54] experienced it, brother. Hallelujah. Or
[53:57] sister, come on. Oh, Jesus. It's real.
[54:01] It speaks to me. Hallelujah.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It isn't just that you praying. No. No.
[54:06] He speaks to me. Hallelujah.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; When I'm in need, God speaks to me.
[54:10] Hallelujah. When I'm just walking on my
[54:12] daily that go. God speaks to you.
[54:14] Hallelujah. How does he speaks to He
[54:16] speaks to you through everything.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. I tell you this
[54:22] right here. I was I was the other day
[54:23] riding on. I tell you, God speaks
[54:24] through everything.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I was riding on the road the other day.
[54:29] A big old bug just fell on the
[54:30] windshield.
[54:32] Big huge looked like a cross between a
[54:35] manis and a I don't know what else.
[54:37] Brother Gerald,
[54:40] but he was I said, "I'm going to ride
[54:41] fast as I can to try to get him to fly
[54:43] off the car." Right. Fast as I would
[54:45] ride, he was holding on. Right. I
[54:48] started thinking about a sermon. I'm
[54:50] still holding on. Hallelujah. Come on.
[54:53] See, that might not stir nobody else,
[54:54] but I was stirred in the car. I said,
[54:57] "Those winds are coming stronger, but he
[54:59] holding on now."
[55:00] &gt;&gt; One of his legs got up, but he was still
[55:02] holding on. I I got stirred up in the
[55:04] car. I said, "No matter how hard the
[55:06] wind blow."
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now. See, y'all laughing at me,
[55:10] sir.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; But I must be crazy all by myself. I
[55:14] said, "I'm holding on now." Hallelujah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; It's midnight. Come on. The earth is
[55:18] shaking. The quakes are Things are
[55:20] hitting, but I'mma hold on. Hallelujah.
[55:23] And when I can't hold on no longer, I
[55:25] believe God will hold on to me.
[55:27] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. I believe that
[55:30] with all of my heart.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; But you find that I said the
[55:35] significance of the oil. Come on. That
[55:37] all that oil became the most vital
[55:40] thing, didn't it? Come on. And it is the
[55:42] most vital thing today. I thought about
[55:44] I says, you know, they trying their best
[55:46] to find something to replace it. And I
[55:49] thought about in the spiritual realm. I
[55:51] said, "Even today, people trying their
[55:53] best to replace the Holy Ghost." Come
[55:55] on. Church is trying their best to
[55:57] replace it, ain't they?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. Replacing it with songs,
[56:01] replacing it with this, replacing it
[56:03] with a shout, a little formal dance.
[56:05] It'll never replace the Holy Ghost. Come
[56:07] on. It'll never replace the power. Come
[56:10] on. But they trying to find something
[56:13] cuz they feel like it's going to run
[56:14] out. But one thing about it, it's a well
[56:16] that'll never run dry. Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody else saying, "Oh,
[56:21] that's just of the past. It ain't like
[56:22] that no more." That's because you hadn't
[56:24] gone deep enough. Hallelujah. But when
[56:27] you go through and you go deep enough,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; come on.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:32] When you hit rock bottom, come on.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; When all of your resources, everything
[56:37] is dried up and you gone deep enough
[56:40] &gt;&gt; and you come to that point of death, you
[56:43] realize then that it ain't ran out.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's the same yesterday, today,
[56:48] and forever. Come on. That's what it is.
[56:51] A lot of times he waiting on you. Come
[56:54] on. Quit trying. Quit doing all this
[56:57] trying to Come on. Because God ain't
[56:58] going to give his credit to nobody else.
[57:01] Come on. But he's God all by himself.
[57:04] Hallelujah. He wants to get all the
[57:06] glory. And I don't know about you
[57:08] tonight, but I said, I want to give God
[57:10] all the glory. It was God that's brought
[57:12] me. It's God that kept me. It's God
[57:14] that'll take me through. Hallelujah.
[57:18] Oh Jesus. Come on. The significance of
[57:21] the oil. Come on. The oil means
[57:23] everything. Can you see the darkness of
[57:25] the hour? Come on.
[57:28] Can you see the hour that we live in?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:32] Can you see that? Like we said, they
[57:34] trying to replace it, right? It can't be
[57:36] replaced. Come on. Remember, there was
[57:39] 10 versions. Clean living. It takes more
[57:41] than that, right? All of that's good,
[57:44] but God got to do something.
[57:47] Come on. He's got to do it the same way
[57:50] he always done it. Come on. That rushing
[57:54] mighty wind is somebody got to have a
[57:56] visitation.
[57:57] Come on. Something that'll change their
[57:59] life to be a witness in the world today,
[58:04] hey, say what you want, do what you
[58:06] want. But I know that he's still real.
[58:08] And you'll find that out one day.
[58:10] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. How many believe
[58:13] that tonight? Come on. I said the
[58:15] significance of the oil. The oil is very
[58:17] important.

[58:33] we 89 seconds. No scientists they
[58:38] afraid. They said 89 seconds from a
[58:41] world catastrophe.
[58:43] 89 seconds. But the but the people
[58:45] today, oh, they laughing. You know what?
[58:47] Just like they did in the days of old
[58:49] old, right? They did that until the day
[58:52] that Noah went in an arc and God shut
[58:54] them in, right? The Bible declared it
[58:56] would be that way. That's why you see
[58:57] the spirit of the age. See the spirit
[59:00] that's on the world today. They got no
[59:01] other choice but to do that because the
[59:03] Bible said it'd be that way. Right? But
[59:05] I'm so glad that God is opening our
[59:07] eyes. I'm so glad that God has given us
[59:09] ears to hear, right? Because you could
[59:11] be sitting in the same church sitting
[59:13] beside your brother, sitting beside your
[59:14] friend, sitting beside and they don't
[59:16] even hear. Why? Because they hadn't had
[59:18] ears. But God, open your ears. Hear.

[1:16:31] in 2017, I think it was. The Lord's

[1:16:44] and we'll just probably have regular
[1:16:48] service
[1:16:49] uh Tuesday at 7
