[41:18] father in Jesus name may you
[41:21] cause the fire to get a hold to the word
[41:24] Lord
[41:25] for you said the letter kill it but the
[41:27] spirit give life May the spirit give
[41:30] life to the word this morning and God

[41:38] and Lord may you heal the sick save the
[41:40] laws restore the backslider meet the
[41:43] needs of your people in Jesus name amen
[41:50] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[41:52] come they were all with one Accord in
[41:54] one place
[41:57] can it happen this morning can we get on
[42:00] one Accord
[42:05] and suddenly there came a sound from
[42:07] Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind
[42:10] and it fill all the house where they
[42:13] were setting
[42:15] and they were appeared unto them clothed
[42:17] in tongues like as a fire
[42:21] and it's set upon each of them
[42:23] and they were all filled with the what
[42:28] you feel this morning that's the
[42:30] question
[42:32] it's all right to be in church it's all
[42:34] right
[42:36] to be called a Christian but how you
[42:38] feel
[42:40] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[42:43] and began to speak with other tongues as
[42:46] the spirit gave them utterance may God
[42:48] bless you read his words you may receive
[42:49] it
[42:50] I want to talk this morning concerning a
[42:53] book of Acts Church
[42:57] you know a church without powers
[42:59] is hopeless people amen when you look at
[43:03] the church this morning you're not
[43:04] looking at the building you're not
[43:07] looking at the uh the preacher you're
[43:09] looking at individuals
[43:12] the church is the mystical body of Jesus
[43:16] Christ
[43:18] in other words it's a mystery to the
[43:20] world Amen
[43:21] but Christ is revealed in you as
[43:24] individuals
[43:26] so Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[43:28] and you're the manifestation of Christ's
[43:32] revealed
[43:33] are you with me
[43:35] I said let my life be a manifestation of
[43:39] his life
[43:41] are you up there
[43:43] if my life amen let it dovetail together
[43:47] let it match
[43:49] amen the life that Jesus
[43:52] amen
[43:54] lived while he was on the earth made
[43:57] that same life
[43:58] be manifested in my life
[44:02] are you with me
[44:04] because sometimes just being a Christian
[44:07] is uh just coming to church and maybe
[44:11] John in the church whether amen you must
[44:13] be born again
[44:15] so I'm saying a book of Acts Church
[44:18] the Bible says in Acts 1 and 8
[44:21] and after the Holy Ghost come upon you
[44:23] you shall have what
[44:25] power
[44:27] praise God if you don't have power in
[44:29] your life
[44:31] you can come to church and go through
[44:33] the motion you're wasting time
[44:36] you're wasting time just coming to
[44:38] church and saying I'm gonna I'm a
[44:40] traditional believer I just come to
[44:43] church and I sat right back and I just
[44:45] relax because I want the preacher to put
[44:47] me in heaven
[44:49] I want the church to place me in heaven
[44:51] but you got to know who you are amen a
[44:54] church without power
[44:57] amen it's not a book of Acts Church
[45:01] an individual without power the devil'll
[45:04] whip you
[45:07] amen
[45:09] but when you got power and authority and
[45:11] you know amen that's greater is he
[45:14] that's
[45:15] are you a man
[45:17] but don't you amen just come and say I'm
[45:20] going through the motion I go to church
[45:22] I go to Broad Tabernacle I go to this
[45:24] one I go to now and then that will make
[45:25] a difference the devil don't care
[45:27] nothing about that
[45:29] but whether or not you got the power of
[45:31] God in your life
[45:33] are you filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:36] do you have the fire of God

[1:01:50] Bible says there's no Beauty we should
[1:01:52] desire him
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] when we see him
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:59] we hear this that we're our faces from
[1:02:00] him

[1:02:03] are you with me in the beginning was the
[1:02:06] word the words with God in the word
[1:02:07] what's God and the Word was made flesh
[1:02:10] and duet Among Us
[1:02:12] he was in the world the world was made
[1:02:14] by him

[1:02:42] but though his blood would never lose
[1:02:45] his power
[1:02:47] it's a possibility that we don't have
[1:02:50] his power
[1:02:51] because we don't acknowledge his blood
[1:02:55] are you a man
[1:02:57] we don't have his power because we don't
[1:02:59] amen see the power of the blood

[1:03:16] is able to wash us
[1:03:18] why did it snow

[1:09:08] you know when I I came to that point in
[1:09:11] my life
[1:09:13] I'm so busy in church looking at what
[1:09:15] folks did
[1:09:17] I can see the preacher
[1:09:19] I said man that preaching ain't nobody
[1:09:20] hypocrite
[1:09:24] even in late years somebody wrote a book
[1:09:28] until the preacher was as big you know
[1:09:31] he was a big Bishop he's a big
[1:09:33] adulteress but I saw that when I was a
[1:09:36] teenager
[1:09:37] I thought when I went to church looking
[1:09:39] I was a mama
[1:09:41] the bishop ain't right Mama said you all
[1:09:44] know what you're talking about son you
[1:09:46] had a friend
[1:09:49] she said oh yeah I couldn't help from
[1:09:51] what I was seeing
[1:09:53] I wasn't blind I was looking right at
[1:09:55] him
[1:09:56] you know what I'm saying
[1:09:57] and you know sometimes you look at
[1:10:00] things and look at folk and you can see
[1:10:03] all the fault in them but mama said Son
[1:10:05] you you need to save yourself
[1:10:08] foreign
[1:10:10] you hear what these pink suits on and
[1:10:14] Red Hats and that can you Super Fly
[1:10:18] somebody
[1:10:20] you need God boy
[1:10:26] I need God all these Hypocrites in here
[1:10:31] you know you look you know it's easy to
[1:10:32] look at all the Hypocrites in it the
[1:10:34] devil makes sure you see him ain't it
[1:10:37] he'll make sure you see all the
[1:10:39] Hypocrites and make sure you overlook
[1:10:41] yourself
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:44] you don't serve God because of all
[1:10:48] good people you see you serve God
[1:10:50] because he's been real to you
[1:10:55] your relationship is not with those
[1:10:57] people your relationship is with God
[1:11:03] and mama told me something that was real
[1:11:05] it doesn't matter what those other folks
[1:11:07] do
[1:11:08] is you and God what you do
[1:11:12] so I had to listen to Mama talk to me
[1:11:15] tell me but it wasn't until God got a
[1:11:18] hold of me
[1:11:20] are you with me
[1:11:21] God got a hold of me it didn't make no
[1:11:24] difference what I saw in others because
[1:11:26] that wasn't going to stop me for serving
[1:11:28] God
[1:11:29] are you
[1:11:31] they wasn't going to stop me because God
[1:11:33] was real to me
[1:11:34] amen God had proved himself to me I know
[1:11:37] I needed God
[1:11:39] and I know I needed help
[1:11:41] and I know I didn't want to go down the
[1:11:43] road did I say nothing's going on
[1:11:46] when you see you
[1:11:47] some of your best friends shoot up in
[1:11:50] drugs and take an overdose and you see
[1:11:52] one of your buddies shot down beside you
[1:11:55] and all and you see all of that and you

[1:19:57] she must have was about 19 to 20.
[1:20:00] and I never can forget that young lady
[1:20:03] she was a real beautiful young lady
[1:20:06] and she come up
