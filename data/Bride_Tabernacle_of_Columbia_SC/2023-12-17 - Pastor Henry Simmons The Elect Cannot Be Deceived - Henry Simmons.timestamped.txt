[32:57] but God it takes the rain to bring forth
[33:00] the seed
[33:02] amen so by the grace of God Matthew
[33:06] 24:24 just one verse here it
[33:10] says for there shall arise false
[33:13] Christ false anointed
[33:16] ones and false
[33:19] prophets and shall show great signs and
[33:25] wonders false teaching
[33:27] Amen in so much that if it were
[33:31] possible they shall
[33:35] what they shall deceive the very Le God
[33:37] bless you so the topic this morning is
[33:41] that the Le Cann not be
[33:46] deceived they
[33:48] elect you might say uh brother Simmons
[33:51] what who are the elect since they cannot
[33:54] be
[33:55] deceived and I want to uh go to uh uh
[33:58] Revelation
[34:00] 13 and show you that the devil you no
[34:05] you you're no match for the
[34:07] devil don't even
[34:14] try Revelation 13 And1 and I beheld
[34:18] another Beast come up out of this Earth
[34:21] talking about
[34:23] America and he had two horns like a lamb
[34:26] the buffalo
[34:27] and he spake as a
[34:29] dragon like Rome spoke
[34:33] amen and he exercise all the power of
[34:36] the first Beast before
[34:38] him and he
[34:40] causes the Earth and them that
[34:43] what Revelation 13 and 12 and them that
[34:48] dwell they in to
[34:51] what worship the first Beast whose
[34:53] deadly wounds heal and he does great
[34:57] wonders so that he make it far to come
[35:02] down from heaven on the earth in the
[35:04] sight of of men and he deceiveth
[35:09] what he deceived them that dwell on the
[35:12] Earth by the means of those Miracles
[35:15] which he had power to do in the sight of
[35:17] the Beast saying to them that dwell on
[35:21] the earth that they should make an
[35:24] image now we have the Catholic church
[35:27] and the image to
[35:29] Protestants of image to the Beast which
[35:34] had been wounded by sword and did
[35:37] live and he had power to give life unto
[35:41] the image of the Beast that they sh that
[35:45] the image of the Beast should both speak
[35:48] and
[35:50] causes that as many as would not worship
[35:55] the image of of the Beast would be what
[35:59] killed
[36:01] becoming and he calluses
[36:04] what he causes
[36:07] what he causing all both small and what
[36:11] rich and what free and bound to receive
[36:16] what Mark in their right hand or in the
[36:22] forehead you received the
[36:24] teaching and then you act upon it
[36:27] the Antichrist teaching and doing the
[36:30] will of the
[36:32] Antichrist some people said I'll never
[36:34] receive the mark of the
[36:36] beast we know that old beast called the
[36:39] devil people are actually serving the
[36:41] devil right
[36:43] now but they said I never do I never
[36:45] receive the mark of the beast you better
[36:47] be
[36:48] careful may be that you already received
[36:51] it because you're doing what the devil
[36:54] tell you to
[36:55] do are you with
[37:00] me
[37:01] so the devil is very
[37:05] deceptive
[37:07] and as I was said in Sunday school this
[37:10] morning it's such a thin
[37:12] line and such a thin line but I I don't
[37:15] want to talk about the devil I want to
[37:17] talk about the
[37:18] elect are you with
[37:21] me uh the elect cannot be
[37:24] deceived but showing you that showing
[37:26] you that the devil is going to deceive
[37:28] all but he can't deceive
[37:31] you are you with
[37:37] me you are not
[37:40] saved by how much knowledge you got but
[37:44] he said he is the man that has wisdom
[37:45] let him count the number of the Beast
[37:48] for is the number of a man so by the
[37:51] grace of God it's not what you know the
[37:55] Bible said no we understand all
[37:58] knowledge are you with me you can have
[38:02] all knowledge and still the devil still
[38:05] got
[38:06] you are you with me do you understand
[38:09] all
[38:11] Mysteries see what I'm saying people
[38:14] think I'm saved because of the Mysteries
[38:15] that I
[38:18] got what makes you
[38:21] elect because you understand all
[38:24] Mysteries are you with me
[38:27] let's look at 1 Corinthians 13 and see
[38:30] because a lot of people are so secured
[38:33] because they understand the
[38:38] mistress 1 Corinthians 13 for a minute
[38:41] it
[38:47] says in the second verse and though I
[38:50] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[38:53] what understand all
[38:55] Mysteries
[38:57] and all
[38:58] what and though I have all
[39:01] Faith see what I'm saying it does that
[39:05] make you
[39:09] elect some people think they going to
[39:11] mystify themselves into rapturing
[39:18] faith if I understand all mistress then
[39:21] I I am the elect but this is not said
[39:25] that okay it says though I understand
[39:30] though though I have the gift of
[39:32] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[39:34] and all knowledge and though I have all
[39:38] Faith some people are so proud of their
[39:40] faith that amen they Faith you know Lord
[39:44] bless me to do this do that and they're
[39:46] so pumped up and and they got faith and
[39:49] God does things through them and for
[39:51] them though I have all
[39:54] Faith does that make you elect
[39:58] are you with
[39:59] me so that I could remove
[40:03] mountains does that make you
[40:11] relay and have not
[40:16] what see brother Fred you see that I
[40:20] have not
[40:22] charity and have not charity it profit
[40:26] me what
[40:28] what let tell you
[40:31] something people are going here going
[40:33] there looking for this and looking for
[40:35] that but don't know who they
[40:39] are the bride has to recognize who she
[40:42] is then the Rapture can take place ain't
[40:43] that
[40:44] right if you don't know who you are
[40:47] you're going to look for somebody else
[40:49] to fulfill the void in your
[40:53] life the thing that you thirsting for
[40:56] maybe be the thing that amen it it it is
[40:59] not going to make you the
[41:05] elect some people you know uh thought
[41:09] that hey do I understand our Mysteries
[41:11] and do I and some preachers preach like
[41:13] you got to understand what I'm
[41:16] saying you got to believe it this way
[41:18] you got to believe it that way I got
[41:21] it does that make you elect because they
[41:25] got it some group oh we got it over here
[41:28] we got it over there what makes you
[41:32] elect the elect means to be picked out a
[41:36] chosen of God
[41:39] selected are you with me elect means to
[41:43] be picked out or chosen of God or
[41:46] elected
[41:47] selected are you with
[41:51] me so brothers and sister we can get
[41:54] excited we can get stir we can hoop and
[41:57] holler we can dance and
[41:59] Shout does that make us
[42:05] elect I
[42:07] want us to
[42:10] realize that it's not you choosing him
[42:14] it's him choosing
[42:19] you yes you can choose the church you go
[42:21] to the preacher you want to listen to
[42:25] but all of your choices is not going to
[42:28] make you
[42:30] elect the elect cannot be
[42:34] deceived and we know that the spirit of
[42:36] antichrist is in the world it was there
[42:38] when Jesus was there it was there when
[42:40] the apostles was there the the
[42:43] Antichrist spirit that was stood against
[42:46] the
[42:52] word to be against the word John know
[42:55] had to deal with it they said the spirit
[42:57] of antichrist is in the world
[43:01] now so brother and sister we going to
[43:03] have to understand the spirit of
[43:06] antichrist the prophet of God bought out
[43:08] that an antichrist spirit is to be
[43:10] against the
[43:12] word it doesn't matter who it is if
[43:15] they're against the
[43:16] word that's the spirit of
[43:20] antichrist but if you agree with every
[43:23] word that proceeded out in the mouth of
[43:25] God then I know who you
[43:28] are man should not live by bread alone
[43:30] but by what every
[43:34] word I'm going tell
[43:36] you the eve the Bible said Adam was not
[43:42] what Adam was not deceived but the woman
[43:45] being what I'm going tell you the church
[43:48] will be
[43:52] deceived but Adam won't be
[43:55] deceived
[43:56] are you with
[43:58] me because Adam was the original
[44:04] seed The Original Seed could not be
[44:11] deceived but the woman being the
[44:13] byproduct isn't that
[44:15] right the devil was able to deceive her
[44:19] but she won't be able to deceive
[44:22] him the devil tried to come against
[44:25] Christ said if you be the Son of
[44:27] God say it's all about knowing who you
[44:32] are on he said if you be the Son of God
[44:36] command these stones to be made
[44:40] bread Jesus say I ain't got to prove
[44:42] nothing to
[44:44] you I ain't got to prove a thing to you
[44:47] who I
[44:48] am are you with me I'm going tell you
[44:51] something when people try to make you
[44:53] prove who you are something wrong with
[44:56] with them that's that same devil that
[44:59] came to Jesus try to make him
[45:03] prove and you know where that Spirit
[45:05] come from you don't have to prove
[45:08] anything to
[45:10] anybody Jesus knew who he was brother
[45:13] and sister you have confidence if you're
[45:15] the elect of God you have confidence in
[45:17] knowing who you
[45:21] are praise God I don't care how great a
[45:25] teacher come by a preacher come by I
[45:27] don't care how many miracles they do it
[45:32] don't are you with me you must be well
[45:36] established in the faith because you
[45:38] know who you
[45:42] are Jesus just kept on saying it is what
[45:47] it is
[45:48] written the bride going to stay with
[45:51] what what's
[45:53] written amen prop God he said I can't
[45:57] add anything to the Bible and I can't
[45:59] take nothing away from
[46:01] it he admonish us to stay with the Bible
[46:04] isn't that
[46:06] right are you with me stay with the word
[46:10] of
[46:12] God praise God but sometime folk want
[46:16] you to stay with their persuasion okay I
[46:20] don't know why I want to go this way but
[46:22] by the grace of God it's all in you
[46:25] having confidence
[46:27] confidence not in your pastor I I
[46:30] believe you had ought to have confidence
[46:32] in him but not the kind of confidence
[46:34] that people going amen you're going to
[46:36] rest your uh ET Eternal destination off
[46:40] of Amen what your pastor believe you
[46:42] must have your own
[46:44] experience amen amen the pastor should
[46:49] only witness to what you are
[46:52] already
[46:54] no amen man but because he said The
[46:57] Confidant which is the Holy Ghost when
[46:59] he come he's going to teach you
[47:01] what are you with me so what happens
[47:05] it's just a witness of what you already
[47:09] know are you with
[47:12] me so let's just go to Ephesians 1 and
[47:17] three there
