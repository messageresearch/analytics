jesus god be good he favored me when i was in the hospital and i want to say thank you jesus because he's been so good and i thank the lord for my family hallelujah i thank the lord for a sweet little nurse came and whistled in my ear and she asked me did you want your family to come and be with you and i told her yes and um she went out and talked to someone and she asked them could they have my family around the clock with me and i praise god for that because they was able to stay all day and all night now thank the lord but i want to say when i went in the hospital on march to 20 it was because i had to cope and i had one of my shots but i think he gets chased to take the second shot before i came down with the covert heading up god says today i update the lord how she came to me she was there when i first got in the hospital at ritual and i was surprised to see her but she was there with me and then they transferred me to baptist hospital that same night i didn't want to go to baptist but they told me that they had a room for me on the w.i.c and i went there and god took the um day of she was there on this one in the morning listening in my ear and telling me how much everyone loved me and about the children of love and everybody's praying with me and i thank god for that and um she continued i'm on the wiki and i continued looking for her but one day i said no and i didn't know i didn't know she had to exit and that's why i concealed but uh i thank the lord for her continued to come when she got better but i just want to say i went out i didn't know when i went out and i passed i went i died twice they told me but look at god what he does he brought me back and i thank god for the prayers of my family church how they pray and they tell me people praying all over and i one night i heard one of the churches i take out of maryland somewhere and they would call my name now i heard them praying for me but i want to say i thank the lord because i really really thought i was dead and i saw marilyn she had came and dressed me i was in a white casket and i prayed and prayed that they'll let me die because i kept hearing forces you know i was so sick until i wanted to die and i heard my brother pass a hearing and i thought him and sierra was doing something that was strange and i said why is he keep on praying and saying to the lord i can hear things that i may not hurt when i was dead but i could hear must be i don't know but i could hear things and hear voices and i heard him say lord let betty live and not die and i say what's wrong with you what are they doing they know i'm dead so why is he doing that i said things would be to change in the church because he keep on saying that i try to figure out why he's saying that and i'm so tired i said where is that willing and shouting the lord because they need to talk to sierra because i hear it doing something and i say i don't know what they do but they need to let me go ahead because i'm tired because i just keep on keep on trying and trying so today she knew what that mess they had on me and i was breathing so hard she said but uh i kept on praying about here it came again and he said lord let better live and not die i said let me live and not die i said maybe i did maybe i am leaving so i stopped praying lord let me live and not die and i kept on saying lord let me live and not die and that's the different scriptures and i started saying lord can you please let me touch to him on your garments so i because we made whole i thought about the woman with the issue of blood and how she wanted to touch to him or to come i didn't realize that i've been through so much i just know i kept praying and prayed i saw my nephew josh maryland saw and he came to me with that big spout and he said i bet it you're going to be all right and that's i didn't see him no more then i saw my brother larry larry he stayed with me the whole time i was going through and i could not understand i tried to shake him off but i couldn't shake him and he was still there with me i could feel freight going through my husband's right going through and i started getting upset and i was shaking and now i didn't know what was going on but i said lord let me not worry let me not stress over frame and i ask god to give me comfort and peace so i could not worry about him but later they told me the stories of what frank was going through and how he was so sick and he had left also and how god brought him back you know i could hear the nurses and different ones talking but they didn't know i could hear them because they told stories to each other that i don't think they wanted me to hear but i could hear i had one two friends they were best friends and one of them would say her husband want a car a truck for forty five thousand dollars and um the other friend said well you're gonna let him put it in his name does that and she said no i've been thinking about it but i'm not gonna do that to him she said you need to do it because he already left you one time and you had to catch up on all the bills and she said well i love my husband i'm gonna do it she said well you told me i didn't want talking to you about it and she said i don't think that's good for you to do and she said well i'm gonna do it anyway so that story [Music] and i remember a lady a nurse irene she stayed with me while i was going through and lately what sierra had told me about her and tasha just told me about i said that's that same lady that was in critical care with me she was so sweet to me they were so sweet that they were fussing over me why they fussing over person i couldn't talk i couldn't see but i could hear and how they were so lovely to me and the doctors there you remember dr chicago i called him dr chicago i could pronounce his name but i realized i wasn't the only one calling dr chicago the rest of them would call them that too the nurses said i would call them dutch but sugar cargo was so good to me i got one on paulo because polo he wore a polo shirt all the time that's what i don't came through y'all when i had good for my brother burnout he'll come and stay with me all day too i hate all my nieces and my daughter they stay at night i mean not all of them it's too many of them but they had boss lady she's not here today but boss lady charlene she had him coming she came when you was a girl boy you had to stay there because she tell you this your day that mean you go and she was so good to me and i remember hell willie she i was trying to be bad one day because i was trying to get that thing out of my throat that um ventilator i would i was trying to get what's called it the reality i was trying to get that out of my throat so i hit the nurse she said no miss betty that's not you but she said i'm gonna tell you something i couldn't see her but i could hear a voice she said miss betty if you take that out of your throat you'll die i bet i ain't tried no more i understood i might have been out of it but i sure understood that you would die so i decided not try that no but i thank god for my family and my brother give me that inspiration black god telling me that i'm not dead i thought i was dead and go about to go but i tell you what i i wasn't sad to die because i already don't be prayed up so i wouldn't die either way he wouldn't win i was gonna be all right but my brother brother now told me they weren't gonna let me down say they came in that living room oh what that easter egg and say they came in that little room they tell me brother matt break up back nick gabby brother mac and bird bird eye were hugging each other and they say that the family were crying and praying so hard but i told me he couldn't they couldn't let me go because i wasn't sick if i was sick they wouldn't let me go but i was not sick so they had to pray me back and they praying up something in that living room that house might have been shaking i don't know because it's so meaningful but i thank god for the space of time it's so much i could tell but i can't tell at all because i just thank god for giving me my life help and strength because like i tell my brother here i couldn't even lift my hand to give god praise every time i tried to praise him my hand flopped back down i looked i tried to do it again flop because i wanted to give god some praise and while i was sleep didn't couldn't hear could see you or nothing i just stopped praying to god in church i would tell yourself i take god for a foundation of knowing how to pray because i will still do my prayer that i will do at home because i pray for him i started to talk my brother robert because he was living during that time i'll stop and i call all their children names out and pray for everybody from the top to the bottom i pray hard for my brother john cause joe got a beautiful heart but satan tried to overtake him so i want y'all to pray hard for him too but i start at the front i don't go to jackie cause they burned out because they are in the family and i pray for all the saints going back on that road just rolling that bro i remember y'all baby well y'all see it said and so that's why i can pray for y'all continually in the hospital because god allowed me to do it and i want to say thank you jesus for giving me another thing and i can raise my hand and i will thank y'all because i thank god for the love of the doctors y'all don't know but me bernard and my sister though so today pants you know too they know i had a good time because there was no need to be sad i started having fun with the doctors from the janitor on up to the x-ray people they all will come in my room they stay i'm on the mic so i can't say something because they got me i don't know who might hear me but they know how they did it i had a good time in y'all i gave them different names and all but the doctors they were good to me and them nurses they was real good be correct be fighting on me laying down on me i even had one come back on a day off from right now say she had to come see miss betty said i couldn't stay home i had to come they prayed with me it's amazing i did not know the but they would take the blood and pray with me they would come do x-ray pray with me the doctors i tell them about jesus because they know it wasn't them alone so i had to let them know about jesus and let them know when i couldn't even talk and they did so much on me one day i'd show the sisters how they did me and i had some i got bruises to show and remembers of what i went through and i don't understand something sometimes it's going to be a mystery but it's all right because i ain't worried about it i stopped them forgiving me i was in critic care they want to give me that old strong powerful medicine i said get that medicine away from me why are you giving me medicine and i'm not in pain so she went out to the doctor as the doctor she don't want to take this medicine and the doctor told her give it to her she needed i said never couldn't need it take it away from me and then they told me they gonna weed me out for when me up from that valley no they won't do it so i said the main doc when i really said do you supposed to be taking your bag i said no i was gonna be taking no medicine like that i said take me off that medicine he said okay miss asked me so he said i'll tell you what i ain't gonna pull it in the drawer no more so they put it in a drawer no more so the other nurses could not give it to me because i was getting off some of that medicine but i never seen all that medicine in my life kind of they give you something in the morning so i'm in the middle of the day wake you up any day give me something overnight i told them why y'all get me out of some medicine i went on all the meds when i came in but i got office on no strong cause you'd be addicted to that medicine i got off of it that you gotta have faith and talk to god tell god all about it y'all know what i can say i said come on in the room come on in the room yes come on in the room let jesus be your doctor and all the medicine that you need hallelujah [Applause] praise god praise god amen praise the lord amen god is good amen god is good amen somebody said he bought me from my mind a long way [Music] it's been almost [Applause] in intensive care for about three months or so but god brought god bought it through amen and god is good amen couldn't walk good and tall couldn't lift her hands didn't i praise god that's why i say you don't know what you're missing when you got an opportunity to do it give him praise while you can praise god you may not have this chance anymore but while you have the breath wanted you can breathe you can praise him give back to god what he gave to you amen i know let us just stand for the reading of the word in hebrews 11 praise god we thank god for let us inspire for a moment father we thank you for our sister betty testimony lord [Music] we thank you for this day lord lord may the holy ghost come [Music] don't let this testimony pass us by but lord let us be encouraged this morning to take the shield of faith let us run this race with patience that is set before us god do bless now these that are listed in these that are here father those that are listening lord god may you move now may your spirit oh god meet every need she said when my god shall supply all of your needs according to these riches in glory so father god i ask now those that are sick those that are afflicted those that are going through the deliberate lord god made you grant victory lord bless our brother john this morning god moving his life forever shut him free from the bondage of god sin and destruction god oh god give him deliverance now in the name of jesus christ for we thank you lord bless your word now did we give you praise and thanks amen as we stand this morning revelation i mean hebrews 11 or 1-7 i'll read the first you'll read the next week read the seven together it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen to through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear for by faith enoch was translated that he should not see there and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god 6. together by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen yet move with fear preparing an ark for the saving of its house by which he condemned the world and became an heir of righteousness which is by faith god bless the reason for what you'll be receiving praise god we want to talk about the supersense faith amen the supersense amen we understand that we have five senses and that's uh sight smell hear taste and touch praise god with those five senses we contact our earthly home we we are able to be to communicate with the earthly but we need faith to contact the heavenly and faith he says here faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the supersense amen and uh it sometimes folks interchanging in ministering they talk about the body the soul and the spirit amen man is made up body soul and spirit animal made up a body and spirit but they don't have a soul so the difference between animal and man man has a soul and with the soul we we can choose to serve god or not so we have uh free will amen we if we wanna we can serve the lord if we don't wanna we don't have to amen so we have a will and uh we find that by nature we were born amen the earthly the carnal we were counterminded and the bible teaches us that counter mind is enmity against god is not subject to the lords of god and neither indeed can it be so we were conquered by nature we know we actually live by what we hear amen what we feel what we see amen and you know a lot of times uh those senses those five senses they dominate and they control our lives now in the spirit realm uh some people change spirit some people say so but in the spirit realm we have imagination conscious memory reasoning and affection those five inlets can i say it again we have imagination conscious memory reason and affection amen and the greatest battle ever fought is fought within our minds are you with me so you have a mind a mind battle we're living in an age amen now amen that people are losing their minds amen everywhere we look because the pressure is so great amen everything is moving so fast it's moving super super fast and because we have everything has speeded up they meant so amen uh man amen cannot grasp everything that's going on so our minds are not capable of grasping all that's going on and so people are having amen their battles they meant they're putting so much pressure on the children in school to the children in school just give up amen so we're living in a chaotic age we're living in an age where a new rotted age a nervous age and nervous tension people are losing it everywhere amen praise god the only place there's sanity and there's peace is in christ are you with me if we're not in christ we don't have any sanity we don't have any peace because jesus said my peace i give you not as the world give give our you amen so we are talking about the the spirit realm amen imagination consciousness and memory and affection and so forth amen but we we faith is the depths and we're talking about the soul realm it operates through faith or unbelief down in the soul now which if you have faith amen in order to have the kind of faith that you need you have to be a christian you have to be born again you know sometimes folks that i and back in our day with young people they said you got to have a strong constitution and you got to have a strong mind you got to have strong will and sometimes if that's all you got amen amen the world is gonna amen praise god give you some difficult times you're gonna need more than a strong constitution and and a strong mind you're gonna need god praise god because the things that you're facing in situations and conditions that you come into amen praise god you're going to need god to fight your battles you're going to need god to have victory and overcoming power without god you're going to fall you're going to fail praise god you're going to need god when the waters are troubled praise god when everything coming against you praise god things are not going the way you think they ought to go and things are not going like you wanted to go praise god the pressure get great sometimes even on young people amen teenagers they're just blowing their brains out they're doing all kind of they're just uh just committing suicide left and right they met because the pressure is so great praise god they have nothing to live for praise god they don't they don't know why they're here they don't know where they're going and they don't know what the purpose of life is the answers are only found in the word of god they admit jesus is the answer for all that you go to and all that you're going through for you said i'm the beginning and i'm the end i'm the first and i'm the last praise god said by faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god so the word of god is the thing the bible says in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god praise god i i i say all the time don't let nobody fool you don't let nobody deceive you the bible said the fool says in his heart that there is no god praise god but there's somebody that made the world the bible said he was in the world the world was made by him and the bible said know ye that the lord he's god it is he that made us and not not we ourselves they meant somebody made you and it got to he meant somebody bigger than you or not so the word of god you know i want you to know that this word is the word of god and it's now listen to what he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now your bible is just not another history book this bible is god in letter form are you with me but if you look at it as just another book amen praise god and and some folk amen they'll try to add to the book and they'll try to take away from the book sometimes folks try to make the bible better so they call it the living bible they call it a new world translation they call it all kind of names to make the bible suit their tastes and where they can understand it and interpret it in their own way so you got so many bibles that it costs a massive confusion among the people so the people don't know amen but it was a time when amen the king james virgin was good enough now people are getting so intelligent said we can't understand that amen but when you got all kind of you come to church and you don't know which bible they're preaching now are you with me but it was once amen everybody understood that i believe god would watch over his word to perform and i believe god a keep this word i believe god is evil amen i believe god's people want something amen that is it is good to testify praise god if it's good enough for the saints of all it's good enough for us now are you with me but uh we find that people amen have to be school and learn and they need so much education to be trying to understand or be a preacher or minister of the word but i want you to know amen a holy man suspect that they were moved by the holy ghost amen it took god sometimes chose men that were ignorant and already learned and he chose them they meant to be his apostles and his followers amen sometimes he didn't say amen uh luke because you were a physician i'm gonna give you the keys to the kingdom he didn't say amen praise god to uh some of those that were uh of the most intelligent that you know the world amen will set one of above another by amen the intellect but god amen looks at the heart amen he he didn't look at the statue of saul and so it's all amen but the people looked at saul and then and they saw a man a man that could represent them as king amen but they overlooked samuel the prophet that god was using amen i want you to know amen god amen looks at his word and he sees that my word is good enough amen my word amen can do the job if you only have faith in it amen praise god i believe god's word amen i thank god for sister bearded testimony i believe god's word is what kept her i believe god's word is what delivered her amen it's the word amen that they mention your hands down in the heart it was the word that brought out and it's a word now god still lives i i i said he's still the same god amen he's the same god today as he was yesterday he's doing the same things oh yes he is thank god amen that we can see and we can say i'm a witness i'm a living witness that god does amen the same things today amen he's still a miracle worker amen he still raises the dead he still calls the lane to walk to come to talk the blind to see he's still god hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god i want you to amen the bible tells us we walk by faith not by sight amen don't don't amen your eyes will deceive you amen because the eyes will tell you that saul ought to be king praise god and uh when they went down to david's house eli ab and all of
