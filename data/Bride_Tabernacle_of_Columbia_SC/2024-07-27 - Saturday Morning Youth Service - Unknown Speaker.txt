give you a mic or you can come up here whatever you're most comfortable with amen so at this time anybody have a testimony amen amen [Music] amen yes sir [Music] amen [Applause] amen God give you the opportunity and he bless you I'm I'm going to show the mercy and goodness and I'm going to let God know um that I appreciate him so I want to give a testimony um for me I don't know my name is Brother Steve Evans I'm from Life tabernac Florence um brother Pastor Fred mull Church um and I just want to get a testimony of God mercy and his grace and hopefully this testimony can encourage um any one out there and we just started sharing this testimony so 8 years ago I have three children um Haven which is 10 and I have twins Eli and Eden um and me and my wife which is coming in now come on you know I got to testify yes sir um in life we make some ignorant decisions right we we do things that we often we don't pray about we we really don't seek God for his guidance we go off of self-will um and so me and my wife you know our first daughter Haven was a twin um and we lost one kind of early and then we had twins again so we said the risk of having another one will be twins again and we didn't want to take that risk um and so we told the doctor to remove her tro completely don't tie them don't burn them take take them out we didn't seek God we didn't ask for his guidance we did us all self-will right which we all know we've done um we we tend don't go to the perfect will of God we we stay in the permissive will hoping that God brings us back to the perfect will so years later we decided you know what we want another child and thinking like well naturally that's not possible to man we say we want another child I want I wanted one more but you can't ask God for one more especially when you already know what you've done so one day in church our pastor asked who wants to have a child and so sometimes you ignorant you caught up in the faith you just do things off Instinct I raised my hand and so for for one point is that's why we have to be careful when we under the anointing of what you ask for right because God will give you your heart's desire so you have to be cautious cuz it be something that can hurt you but because he see your heart's desire and you keep asking for it he'll give it to you but I raised my hand and I said I want another child and everybody's laughing and so I kept going we had a woman's night um at the church and my wife had to wrote several things down and the fifth thing she wrote down was she wanted to have a baby naturally now again remind you we already took the tubes out so in our minds that's not possible they said the only way you can get pregnant is by fertility we didn't want to go that route so she put it in the Bible she put it in Acts okay so then she comes around she says Steve my pyet come on so I start to get kind of like well what's going on so I said you you know let's get a pregnancy test Let's test this out the pregnancy test came back it was a faint line so then I started taking a seat back said hold on now something something let's take another pregnancy test she took another one it was a faint line now please don't laugh when I tell you this cuz I'm I'm telling you this cuz I want to tell my testimony High my ignorance was a blessing yes so just to make sure the preg test wasn't voided I took the pregnancy test sir and it came back negative so I already knew okay cuz if I don't if I don't tell it exactly you want to appreciate God's mercy and his grace right so then we waited a couple days later and she got the test that says yes or no come on come on and so we took it and it says yes so I said something's not right like in my mind as much as I already see the evidence of God I'm trying to deny it right I'm saying well take a fourth one let's be sure not like the first one when he said God heard him to Daniel I heard you the first time Lord but see a lot of times we reason and doubt when God said I heard you the first time but he just waiting on us to fully believe that all things are possible so we said well let's schedule a doctor appointment okay now my heart's beating a little bit so we go to the doctor and we sitting there and it's the same lady the ultrasound like the same lady that was with my daughter has been the whole she she automatically says girl you pregnant with twins I said twins can't be how so we going to doctor's office and the doctor the same doctor that deliver all three of my kids well the two the three he said do y'all take some type of drugs for you had to do something we said no we didn't do anything we said how is it possible now he's been in medicine 30 years and now doctor is telling me how is this possible so God had given me the unction to do something I took the letter that my wife had wrote in Acts and I had it with me that day and I pulled it out now it's time to testify and I showed him well my wife this is what she wrote down this is not by coincidence this is something we asked for and so in that doctor's office he cried wow because he saw the power of God and at that moment I knew God was I already knew God was real but at that moment I knew God had done something no matter what I go through in my life moving forward no matter what that God is real to me so we went to the doctor he said let's come back in a few weeks and God know desire of our heart he knew two more babies would be tough right so he blessed us with one one did not make it which I am totally great with the perfect will of God cuz he knew we could hand another one so then my second question is I want a boy come on right if if you want something from God you got to be what specific right and so I want a boy not necessarily I didn't want another girl but I wanted a boy to go with my son Eli and God bless us with another boy so my testimony is amen try God if you if you don't have a relationship with him try him amen if you haven't talked to him in a while try him to my sisters if you want a baby the same thing he did for my wife we're no we're not special there's nothing we did we just had a sincere heart and we tried him try God Lord give him another opportunity to show you who he is and I promise you he won't fail If He Did It Before He'll Do It Again the Lord [Music] anybody else praise the Lord okay all right buddy [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll be loud hey man God bless the Saints um my name is brother Timothy Milton from Virginia um fellowshiping with brother Kelvin Mo and Elizabeth City North Carolina I just want to give God thanks like the brother said if God give you an opportunity to testify of his goodness you take that opportunity amen so I just want to give God thanks um about how he spared my life a little while ago uh I used to work at a uh small construction company based in uh Portsmouth Virginia and this we uh we did kind of various types of work from cutting grass to building stuff to HVAC all kinds of stuff so um on this particular day we know we had worked all day we worked the whole shift and so we were my manager and I we just it was him and I we went out to do a job in uh my city where I live suff Virginia and so we're out in this yard this backyard helping another crew dig some holes to put a fence up and so with us we brought a tractor along and an augur for those who don't know who an augur is it's like a giant blade you're drilling the ground with well this this one is a little bigger cuz it's ATT tractor attachments it's about know this tall as a spiral blade but um so we bring this along you know we're out here digging holes so we dig a couple of them but in this yard it's like a lot of stuff up under the dirt that we can't see like bricks and tree roots and all kinds of stuff so know we get to dig in a couple of holes next you know the blade starts getting caught and the bolt that holds it together snap so like well that was quick guess we're done here the guy like hold on hold on I think I might got another another bolt in my truck so he goes and gets it now we we shouldn't have Jimmy rigged it we shouldn't have you know put something in place that didn't belong there but you know we put it up there we kept on going so a couple holes later that one broke she's like all right he's like I think I got some more we going to do this as long as it takes till we get all the way around this yard you know I'm seeing this thing I'm watching this blade I'm just singing in amazement I'm watching this thing just slic through bricks and tree roots I'm like I hate to be caught in that so you know we get to going around and we get to the um the very last hole now in this backyard it's kind of like a bushy area and it got like a little bit of a fence and so the way this um tractor arur worked he would like raise and lower it but like I had to like guide it cuz it was like kind of at an angle so I had to hold a lever to keep it straight so it drill straight down so that was my job I hold it in place while he drills up and brings it up I tell him when to go down tell him when to go up so you know we get to this last hole and the way it's set up I'm like how we going to do this cuz either I'm going to be back in the bushes like up against the fence like this while the blad like right here in front of me or he just going to have to like drill it in sideway so I'm like you know all right I'll get back there so I'm back here I'm drilling but before I tell him to go down give him the okay to go down I see like a little bit of wire like chicken wire and stuff down there so I'm like hold on hold on so I get it out the way a little bit I didn't know there was like more that was up under there so now I give him the thumbs up you know go ahead and start drilling so he starts drilling down and that blade starts getting like caught up in the chicken wire so I'm seeing this is kind of going crazy like it's getting caught up all up in the wire the blad starting to go crazy so I'm like okay let me get from back here cuz you know this is too close to me I'm standing right here back up against the bushes I ain't got nowhere to go so let me get out from around here I tell him I said you know it's just bring it up we got to get the rest of this out the way bring it up so I go to step out from around it and because it's getting all caught in this wire that bolt snapped again well because he was bringing it up and that bolt snapped again this time while I was stepping out from around it that blade swung caught me in the leg took me off my feet and started like getting into my leg a little bit well it wasn't his leg it was his leg but started getting into my leg a little bit so you know he tried to shut it off but you know it don't shut off like immediately so the blad got a slow to a stop so you know he asked me you know are you all right I thought my leg was gone cuz you know I it was like it happened so fast but so slow at the same time thinking like well my legs going I ain't feel the pain yet but I thought I was in shock or something so you know I get up or try to get up at first I couldn't get up then I Tred it again so I'm thinking like oh man like maybe my legs just sprang so you know it was it was hurting but it wasn't feeling too bad so he's like you know take your shoe off take your um roll your pants and make sure you ain't all cut up by God's grace it won't really hard any Cuts so you know he told me know go ahead sit down you know it's the end of the day you know we we ain't going to do nothing else but go back to the office and clock out you know go home so I go over I sit down take my shoe off start examining I don't feel no broken bones so I was like you know just thank you Lord for that and so you know he goes he puts the equipment away and you know we get to going I can tell he's all kind of shook up about it cuz you know I'm his employee he's the manager you know and I get injured on his watch so you know he's trying to keep me talking telling me you know keep your leg moving cuz you don't want it you know stiffing up on you and so you know we drive back to the office but at that point I made up my mind like cuz this wasn't like the first injury that happened I was like injured but never like nothing serious but I'm like you know I can't keep doing this at this job so you know I'm going to have to move on from this I'm like I want to have a conversation with the boss when we get back to the office well he had left when we get there cuz I don't know it was time to go home it had been a long day for all of us but um I'm been know to me my uh father who was back there brother Milton he was at work at the time and he said that he felt on his heart you know at the same time which I didn't know until you know he told me later on he said that God put on his heart pray for your children and so at that exact same time while we getting to that last point in which is like 4:30ish the same time God put on his heart pray for your children and he didn't know why and I didn't know he did it but um so I get back to the office after learn boss said left I'm like all right I'm just going to go ahead home but now I face a dilemma I'm like do I drive straight home with in this agonizing pain or do I you know sit and wait on you know my dad's at work I want my mom have to come way out here and I want to leave my car here so I'm like you know what I'm just going to go ahead and drive home it the only God that kept me cuz I was not at all focused on the road my leg like the pain was started out like low but the pain just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse so I'm trying my best that's the focus on the road I get home you know tell my mom and everything that happens she's like all right she's like you want to go to the hospital I'm like no I I just want to lay down it's been a long I've been working all day I just want to lay down she's like all right I'll be right back when I get back be ready to go so you know so she goes I try to go to sleep soon as I'm about to fall asleep she come back let's go I'm like so um she's like come on let's go to the hospital I said well I said let's pray over it cuz that's my thing I don't really like doctors and pills and all that so let's just pray over it I'll be all right just like that so we prayed over she's like you know but we still going to go to the hospital anyway so you know we go to the hospital they get the X-ray and everything by God's grace somehow which is I say somehow because by man's standards it was impossible but With God all things are possible there were no broken bones it would barely any Cuts or anything so if you looked at You' be like well nothing happened to you I'd be like well something did happen but um I just want to thank God for that um I was all right I didn't really need any crutches they didn't they just kind of gave me a sleeve you know gave me some recommendations you know but that very same week well no let me start the day after that was on Wednesday night service at our church and by God's grace I was able to walk I played the drums at the church by God's grace I'm thinking like man this like I'm literally less than 24 hours removed from you know what happened yesterday and I'm up here walking in church playing the drums but um the next day after that and this is happened on a Tuesday on that W Thursday and Friday were these meetings last year and so that very same week of these meetings last year was the same week this happened so a couple of days later after this happened I was in these meetings by God's grace I wanted to testify in but um you know there was others they had their testimonies I'm like you know and my dad was getting on like man you should have got up there and testify you know I didn't I want to give everybody their chance but I just want to thank God you know he spared my life cuz um as I mentioned as I walked around and it swept me off my feet well just as easily it could have swept me forward Face Forward into a spinning blade you said oh that's just the grace of God things like that that we all take for granted so I just want to thank God for [Music] that praise the [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord God bless you um my name is sister clavia from

some words after this I woke up this morning to get ready for ministers meeting and I saw a text said uh man can you share something this morning I said this dude know I just started preaching and know I need some time to prepare so y'all pray for me Amen on this morning and we going to jump straight into the scripture let's go to Mark chap 11 and we will go to amen verse 23 kind of in the same uh theme of what we've been talking about this morning amen great testimonies uh one of the things I appreciate about brother Keith's uh message message last night is he he touched on things that we sometimes forget that the quotes from 47 the all of those are are are great but people are going through stuff and they need to hear these testimonies that God still can make ways out of no ways people dealing with depression anxiety thinking about killing themselves they need to know that God is the answer amen let's go to Mark 11: 23 and it's very familiar passage of scripture that we all know very well and Jesus starts out here he says for verily I say unto you which means listen real good that whosoever shall say unto this mou now who is whosoever that's everybody in this room young uh middle age older whosoever shall say to this mountain which is personal I know the mountain that's in front of you now what is that mountain that mountain is anything in your life that is that you can't move you tried it all and it's failed but it's standing in front of you and you sang the song like the songwriter says Lord if you don't do it it just won't get done so whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatever he saith may the Lord have blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen you know the prophet of God when he he preached the message speak to this mountain I than it was um 59 he said that uh when he got to this passage of scripture he he struggled with this because he couldn't really get an understanding of Lord you're actually saying what I say and it was from the perspective he said what if I say something wrong and the Spirit came to him and said if you anointed to brother kei's point last night when you got the spirit of God on the inside of you that would direct you the right thing to say now we we got to understand that to get to this point Jesus I only got 10 15 minutes so I'm trying to paraphrase here he gets to this point to where he finds this tree and Jesus is hungry and he walks up to this this tree and the tree is bearing leaves now if you know what a fig tree is a fig tree if it Bears leaves it should produce figs so he goes to this tree and he's hungry and he goes to the tree and there's no fruit on this tree so he gets upset and he says since you're a fake tree since you're a tree that's not producing any fruit I curse you my since you're a religious tree and we see this brother ke talked about it last night just because you have the quotes from 47 to 56 does not mean you got it you got to have something on the inside of you you shall know the tree by the fruit it bears and not by the leaves it bears you can look good you can smell good you can have all the quotes but if there's no life on the inside of you you can speak all you want that mountain will stay right there people always say Lord I want God to pour into me I want God to pour me till I overflow have you ever seen somebody watering a fake tree you'll think they crazy why you watering that there's no life there God can only pour into something that has life on the inside of it one of those fruits the Bible tells us what those fruits are see the statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge you can't stop at knowledge there's more to add math class ain't over yet you got some more adding to do so you just can't stay at amen so he says to this tree be thou removed and cast to The Sea and shall not DOT in his heart but believe those things which he shall come come to pass he shall have whatever he saith amen let's go down let's go back a verse here let's go to verse 21 good old Peter and Peter calling into remembrance saith unto him behold Master this fig tree without th curses is withered away and Jesus gives them the answer or the the the cheat sheet if you will of how to remove mountains he didn't go into no deep back and forth oh I prayed night and day I went he said simply have faith in in God now that's that that that sounds good but you've got to understand to have faith in God is three things you got to have faith in his word have faith in his will and have faith in his way yes sir we all know that God is Jehovah gy but what if he tells you no come on what if he says not yet can you trust his will and his way for your life if you say God is my Jehovah Gyra and I need him to provide and and add Financial blessing to me what if his way is for you to get fired to teach you how to manage your finances are you okay with that can you still have faith that God is Jehovah Gyra see we come to God sometimes and we pray Lord I need you to be Jehovah Gyra but we have our own way of how we want it to happen come on can you trust God's word God's will and his way come on you know Matthew 17 says you have have faith the size of a mustard seed that's small if you have faith in God the size of a mustard se you can move that mountain now some of us and I'm looking at my own personal life you can have all kinds of faith in your job have all kinds of faith in people but they'll fail you every time don't matter how much if it's the wrong Source it'll fail you amen yes sir a lot of faith in the wrong thing won't move your Mountain but a little faith in the right thing can move mountains you know yes uh all the testimonies this morning were all based off of whether facts contradicted the promise on the fact said brother Steven should not have had a child but God's promise said he was sometimes the words that come out of my mouth confirm facts and negate God's promise we don't confirm facts church we are a church that that that walk on God's promises the facts will always contradict What God Says the facts may be yeah you smoked weed the facts may say yeah you you drank alcohol but God's promise say I never lost one the God's promise is I'm a savior so don't matter where you are in your life don't don't confirm the facts the facts may say on your doctors report that you have cancer that's not God's promise God's promise is I am a Healer by his stripes I'm Healed the facts may say you got $250 in your bank account my God share supply all of my needs don't confirm the facts church we are believers we don't walk by facts we walk by [Applause] faith life is in the power of your own tongue in this life facts will always contradict what God says but we don't go off of facts the facts are accurate but God's promises says otherwise amen so he says have faith in God that is God's word God's Will and God's way man let's keep moving here amen chapter 20 verse 23 we can keep moving it says for ver I say unto you whosoever say sa to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the ceas and not doubt in his heart you know in in in the prophet's Ministry when God ushered him to this the third poort Ministry and we all know the story about the squirrels those first two squirrels popped up but when it got to that third one there was a delay come on on now there was a pause and he started to question then he went back to the scriptures don't doubt in your heart just because you don't see it don't mean it's not there just because you can't feel it does not mean it's not happening glory to God just because you see see sometimes church we got to understand that when we worship God in spirit and in truth that means negating how our emotions feel yes because your emotions will not always agree with the situation that's true brother your feelings would not always agree but can't you still say like Jo blessed be the name of the Lord that's what true worship is anybody can praise God when everything's going good amen when all is well I can praise God but when things don't go your way when you don't agree with God's choice can you still say Lord I Thank You Lord I bless you Bible says in John that he's longing for True worshippers and what is worship making it always about him and not about you that's what worship is anybody can praise the Bible says let everything that have breath praise the Lord but worship is something different can can you get on your knees and say Lord I don't agree My Flesh don't agree but I can still trust you that's what Jo was he lost everything but the Bible says immediately he got on his knees while he's crying and he worship your feelings and your emotions will not always agree with God's way and his way but that does not mean you should not obli and say Lord I thank you anyway glory to God Amen verse 24 he says therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall what have them now I'm going to wrap up with this last thing here and this is kind of been the foundation I've seen the church that says perfect love on that's where we've been at but Jesus sums it up in this next p scripture he says and when ye stand pray come on forgive so forgiveness is a condition of your Mountain being moved that's that's the book that's what it says when ye stand praying forgive so we getting on our knees and we saying Lord I need you to get this mountain out my way nobody else can't do it I need you and God wants to get to the mountain but unforgiveness in our heart we're literally playing offensive line God is trying to get to the quarterback and we blocking them anytime he tries to go around we blocking them people have done us wrong we still holding on to it when you stand praying forgive I want to remove this situation out your life but you you ain't nothing too hard for me but you making it hard you waiting on me and I'm waiting on you when I saw saw this passage of scripture it hit me like a like a brick say Lord on my knes I'm praying there are things in my life that I need you to remove am I the one holding you up because I have not went back to people that have done me wrong listen I I told the church this I love everybody I I love my brothers and I love my sisters but nobody should be more important than your prayers getting answered nobody so if if Brother come on over here let's have a sit down because we need to get this right because I got some mountains in my life that I need God to move so come on over here let's talk let's let's work this thing out because you're not more important than my prayers getting answered so so wrapping this up church we all have mountains in our life that we need God to move he's a mountain moving God he's a miracle working God he's a way maker you just got to trust him and have faith amen that's all I got amen we appreciate our brother Caleb I pray for me [Applause] [Music] amen amen God is good amen man I'm going to go ahead and just go straight to the word real quick and we'll read from Romans chapter 8 and it's a very familiar scripture and I think it's in line of what everybody has been saying to us today and I I I thought this thing came to me last night and I was praying asking Lord what should I say and some came to me and I and I wrote it down and said God has not forgotten about you that's right God has not forgotten about you and every testimony today proves that God has not forgotten about you every testimony that they told where he said I would heal you God has not forgotten about you all you have to do is brother Maas said have faith and you can trust and see what God will do and see in Romans chap 8 verse 28 when they have it it'll come up and it says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God so many of times people quote the scripture and they read only part of it come on they read the first part and said we know that all things work together for the good but they forget to them that love God see there's a requirement to get all the things work together to the good it says to them that love God to them that are called according to to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate see God he knew you from the foundation of the world he knew you before you Ste foot into this world he knew you before your father and your grandfather and your great-grandfather even was born into this world he knew that you was going to be here he knew that you was going to stand here today and he knew that you might have things in your life that you need him to work on Amen and said I I and you know sometimes you look at the minister and you think that sometimes he is immune from you come on because he's there in the pull pit and he says these many things but sometime God has to deal with him too and God takes him through things to show you know to remind them you know that you're not too great or you're not too Mighty you're not too strong but God has a way of allowing you to see that he's still real he has a way of showing up each and every day when you look up and you get up in the morning to show you that he's still real and he'll take you through things but it's all in allowing you to to become stronger in your faith it's allowing you to become greater in your faith allowing you to get to a point that you said Lord I trust you more cuz at the end of the day only perfect love is going to get there but if you can't go through the Small Things how can God trust you with the great things if you can't go through this little trial how can God get you to where you want to be but you're asking for great things but you don't want to go through nothing you don't want to go through nothing and realizing that all your steps are ordered by him so if he allow you to go through it he made a way for you to get through it if he put it on you he had a way to provide provide a way of Escape if he said I would heal you maybe he has to give you sickness but maybe it's not for you but it's a testimony to somebody else to prove that he's God it's a testimony to show them that all things do work together for the good no matter how bad it gets no matter how bad it is God is still good and it's a way of how you declare of what God is some people the only like brother Keys was saying last night said the only God that they may see is you that's it that's why I look at it I say you know the greatest testimony that you can have you can have all these great testimonies but the greatest testimony is the life that you live every single day when you walk out of the church do what do people see what do people say behind your back cuz I tell you when when you live a life of God you don't even have to say nothing when you walk into the room people know that you're different people know that there's some something different about you I've had many situations in my life where I didn't say anything but people come to me and say can you pray for me come on yes sir can you pray for me because they knew that there was something different you might have said I might be a Christian but they come to you and ask you for prayer come on now I told the story one time I was in school and this young lady one of my friends that I had and she had this exam she had to take and so we came to the exam and she said hey can you pray for me and she was like I I want to get a certain grade so that if I pass this and get a certain grade I won't have to take the final so I went down and you know sometimes we think you know you got to say elaborate prayer but it's in the scripture that you don't he said the Publican I was praying all these little things and then this one that came with a short still prayer he said that's the more sincere prayer that's the one that reached heaven and so I came I said Lord just allow her to get the grade that she needs so she doesn't have to do it I don't know why she asked me and then we came to it about a week later she came back she was excited she said I got the grade that I needed and it was a testimony to me because I realize that when I go to God I can ask him and then I can expect something to happen it doesn't matter what I ask him for if I can go and expect him to have it said and it was because of faith that I believe that God could do it I came to and I believe that God can move I believe that God could do it there's nothing too hard that my God cannot do and see I understood that and it didn't matter whether he did it for me maybe that was a testimony for them and their life to prove that God can do things and they can go to them and build that relationship for themselves but what testimony do you have what testimony do you have when you walk out of this door you might have a wonderful testimony in church come on now you might have a wonderful testimony when you walk inside these doors but what is your testimony when you're late at night and you're all alone what is your testimony when you're on your job what is your testimony when you get invited to that event which you knew you shouldn't have went to in the first place but you showed up just to see who was going to be there come on come on now what is your testimony because listen when you walk out of here nobody knows what you may do cuz you might be by yourself you might live alone you might live far away from a church you might live by yourself but who knows what is your testimony then do you have an acceptable testimony i i i ministered one time and I and I titled it are you ready for what's next when you look at life and you look at the even the current events of things that's going on in the world are you ready on because you never know when this moment is your last or when this moment they say you know what you can't come to church no more you you're not allowed to come in these doors where where's your testimony going to stand there where can you turn and say Lord I seen you do this and I seen you did this and I asked you for this and I've seen you do this and now I can't believe for greater amen I can believe that I if like we had the other day where you seen the Cyber attack attack not only the airplanes and these things but attack the grocery store amen where you couldn't go in there and you couldn't buy groceries amen because it didn't work amen do you have faith enough to say Lord I don't have anything but I believe that you can provide cuz you promised in your word that will supply all my needs that's what brother said and brother maah said see when these things happen you don't know what level of Faith you need but there's a faith that you're going to need to get up out of here so one day when your faith increased and you and you have that love in your heart and that Faith increase you can get up out of here you can translate and you can move on to what God has for you cuz it's all in his word thank you Lord there wasn't nothing that's not covered in his word amen no matter how difficult it is no matter how bad it may seem no matter how worse it may get there's nothing that's not covered in there where you can't open your Bible you can't read it and God can't speak to you said if you want to get closer to God the prophet of God said it he said all you had to do is read your Bible and pray Lord cuz I believe if you get on your knees many of times you may go to God and we can all be guilty of this where you go and you ask and you ask and you ask but do you ever listen that's it that's it come on do you ever sit down and and not only talk to God but have a conversation with god where you sit down and you recognize that when you're sitting down and you're praying and you talking to God and you hear that voice that's not your parents that's not you thinking but it's God speaking to you cuz I promise if you want to hear him he will speak to you amen and I no this for myself and that you you sometimes you need those personal experiences with God you need you need those things that you can't tell nobody but you need God to work them out amen and you might not can't go to friend family or nobody but you say Lord there's a need in my life there's a need in my life Lord I don't know what your need may be but I know that Jesus can supply all your needs I don't know what you may go through but I can tell you he's a deliver he's a provider he's a keeper if you want to be kept but see first of all you got to come to and lay it all down it does you no good to to come to God give it to him and and once you step away pick it back up that that shows God that you don't really trust him when all that he requires you to do is to trust him brother I said but we know that all things work together to The Good the them that love him amen so many of us we may come to Crossroads in life where you have to make a choice amen and you don't know sometimes it's all in what choice you make how the rest of your life can end up now God has grace and mercy and you can hear testimonies of where God has brought it you from but some of you don't have to make the choice to be out there I said sometimes I said many people want to do this and they have these great testimonies I said you know it's a more powerful testimony to be in church and stay in church oh brother and have and have a relationship with God that people know that you have a relationship with God and believe that God is able to do exceedingly abant abant more than you can ask or think because God is real amen and the devil is real and if you don't believe it all you have to do is go outside and just look and You' realize that this is a more blessed life this is a better life to live and there's testimonies to show you that God is good and he allows you there's a reason why you see Brothers like brother Jos tell you to stay cuz they've experienced it and God has blessed them to come back amen but if you don't have to experience it why would you I I tell people all the time there's some lessons in life I don't have to learn from myself I can just look and listen to what somebody told me and realize that that's the truth and I don't have to follow that path you don't have to go down certain Pathways cuz you don't realize some of the scars that may come with those paths you don't realize some of the thoughts that may come with those paths some of the memories that the devil will bring up to you in your mind when you all alone because he know that's your weakest point where you have to believe God even stronger to even make it through those moments there are things that people tell you that testimonies because God is trying to warn you trying to keep you but it's all as if you want to be kept amen so today I implore you to come to him if you have not given your life to Christ today is the opportunity today is the day to make a change in your life that you can go forward and say Lord I don't I've done a lot of things but today I Surrender see it comes to you that you have to give it up all amen you can't just give a part of it and keep part God wants all of your heart and when you give them all I guarantee you I guarantee you the things that you are afraid of God will keep you from them the things that you are scared of God will keep you God will guide you God will lead you he will allow you to overcome them if you give it all to it's not just a piece of it it's not just a part of it God will do all that he promised he would do but you got to give him all of it not just a piece of it it's not just good to come to church on it's not just good to be a faithful member God wants to do more than that God wants you to finally come to him and say Lord I give it up hard and I guarantee you if you give it up people I say all the time people think it's hard to get the Holy Ghost oh brother I said no it's not all you have to do is empty everything out sometimes your dreams sometimes your desires sometimes these things that you got farfetched of what you want to be and how you want to be it but if you come to God and you give it up everything
