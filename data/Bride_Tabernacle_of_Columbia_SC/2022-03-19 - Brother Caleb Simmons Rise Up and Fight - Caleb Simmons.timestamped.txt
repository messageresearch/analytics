[30:49] chapter seven
[31:06] when you got it say man
[31:11] i'll wait for a few more
[31:16] all right judges chapter 7 and verse 1
[31:19] and it reads
[31:21] then derubable who is gideon and all the
[31:24] people that were with him rose up early
[31:27] and pitched beside the well herod
[31:30] so that the host of the midianites were
[31:32] on the north side of them by the hill of
[31:35] mora in the valley and the lord said
[31:37] unto gideon the people that are with
[31:40] thee are too many for me to give the
[31:43] midian knights into that their hands
[31:45] these israel want themselves against me
[31:48] saying my own hand has saved me
[31:51] now therefore go to proclaim in the ears
[31:54] of the people saying whosoever is
[31:56] fearful and afraid let him return and
[31:59] depart early from the from mount gilead
[32:03] and there returned of the people
[32:05] twenty and two thousand and there
[32:07] remained ten thousand and the lord said
[32:10] unto gideon the people
[32:12] are yet too many bring them down into
[32:14] the water and i will try them for thee
[32:17] there and it shall be that of whom i say
[32:20] unto thee this shall go with thee the
[32:22] same shall go with thee and whomsoever i
[32:25] say unto thee this shall not go with
[32:28] thee the same shall not go so he brought
[32:31] down the people into the water and the
[32:32] lord said unto gideon every one that
[32:35] left it of the water with his tongue as
[32:37] a dog lapith him shalt thou set by
[32:39] himself likewise everyone that bow with
[32:42] down upon his knee to drink and the
[32:44] number of them that left putting his
[32:46] hand
[32:47] on their to their mouths were 300 men
[32:51] but all the rest of the people bowed
[32:53] down upon their knees to drink water and
[32:55] the lord said unto gideon by 300 men
[32:58] that left will i save you and deliver
[33:01] the midian knights into thine hand and
[33:03] let all the other people
[33:05] go every man unto his place
[33:08] so the people took victorias in their
[33:10] hands and their trumpets and he sent all
[33:12] the rest of israel every man into his
[33:14] tent
[33:15] and retained those 300 men and the host
[33:18] of the midian was beneath him in the
[33:20] valley
[33:21] god bless the reading of this word you
[33:23] may be seated
[33:24] i'm going to read down a little bit
[33:26] further here in the scripture
[33:28] and it says
[33:30] and it came to pass the same night that
[33:31] the lord said unto him arise get deep
[33:34] down unto the host for i have delivered
[33:36] it into the into thine hand but if thou
[33:40] fit if thou feared to go down go thou
[33:43] with fear fura thy servant down to the
[33:46] host and thou shall hear what they say
[33:49] and afterwards shalt nine hands be
[33:51] strengthened to go down into the host
[33:53] then went
[33:54] he down into with fury his servant unto
[33:57] the outside of the armed men that were
[34:00] in the host and the midianites and the
[34:01] malachites and all the children of the
[34:03] east lay
[34:04] along in the valley like grasshoppers
[34:07] for multitudes and their camels were
[34:09] without number as the sand by the
[34:11] seaside for mo for multitude and when
[34:14] gideon was come behold there was a man
[34:16] that told a dream unto his fellow and
[34:19] said behold i dreamed a dream and lord
[34:21] caico barley tumbled into the holster
[34:24] midian and came into a tent and smoted
[34:27] that it fell and overturned it in that
[34:30] tent lay along
[34:31] and his fellow answered and said this is
[34:33] nothing else say the sword of gideon the
[34:36] son of joash a man of israel but into
[34:39] his hands as god deliver midian and all
[34:42] the hosts and it was so when gideon
[34:44] heard telling of the dream and the
[34:46] interpretation
[34:48] thereof that he worshipped and returned
[34:50] into the host of israel and said arise
[34:53] for the lord hath delivered into your
[34:56] hand the host of midian amen
[34:59] amen i'd like to take a little topic
[35:01] this evening of rise up and fight
[35:05] rise up and fight in this story if you
[35:08] read before
[35:10] israel was in a hard time
[35:12] israel enemies they was coming in the
[35:14] chapter before israel enemies was coming
[35:16] every time at harvest time and taken
[35:19] everything that they had planted and
[35:21] harvested the children of israelites had
[35:23] planted and harvested all the many crops
[35:26] and all the fields to the point that
[35:28] they was having to hide the food they
[35:30] was having to hide the blessings that
[35:33] god had given them from the enemy
[35:35] because the enemy was coming in like a
[35:37] flood and at one point in time god came
[35:40] and he said it's time for deliverance
[35:43] it's time for deliverance and it's time
[35:45] for for the israelites to be victorious
[35:48] over their enemies it's time for them to
[35:50] have victory so so he came and he spoke
[35:53] to gideon and he said and he and gideon
[35:56] said
[35:57] the angel of the lord came to him and he
[35:58] spoke to him and said gideon i'm going
[36:00] to use you to lead your people into
[36:02] victory and gideon said
[36:05] he said
[36:07] he said if god be with us then where be
[36:10] where is all the miracles
[36:12] if god be with us the god that brought
[36:14] us
[36:15] from the land of egypt across the the
[36:17] red sea and into the land that we're in
[36:20] if he be with us then where be all his
[36:22] miracles
[36:23] and it was time for the israelites to
[36:25] rise up and fight it was time for them
[36:27] to get some gumption about themselves
[36:29] and realize that the battle was the
[36:31] lord's not theirs it wasn't something
[36:33] that they was fighting it was god's
[36:35] battle all they had to do was stand up
[36:37] and be ready to be to fight that's all
[36:40] they had to do
[36:41] and so gideon was like well i'm not sure
[36:44] so he tested him he put the lord through
[36:47] a series of tests that you can read but
[36:49] here in this story the lord wanted to
[36:51] show him a sign that he had victory that
[36:54] victory was his so he took him down to
[36:56] the camp and he said go down there and
[36:58] god sent the enemy a vision
[37:01] that gideon was going to destroy them
[37:04] the enemy already knew what was going to
[37:06] happen before it happened and god was
[37:08] just confirming to gideon that
[37:10] i'm already with you all you have to do
[37:13] is rise up and fight cause the battle is
[37:16] yours it's not yours but it's the lords
[37:18] and he has given you the victory and in
[37:20] this gideon he got his men together he
[37:23] said y'all can in verse 15 it says arise
[37:26] for the lord hath delivered into your
[37:28] hand the the holster media gideon was no
[37:31] longer worried was he gonna win this
[37:33] battle
[37:34] gideon was no longer worried was his
[37:36] enemy going to defeat him because he had
[37:38] signed after a sign that showed him that
[37:40] god was on his side god had given him
[37:42] this victory all he had to do was stand
[37:45] rise up and fight he had to go out there
[37:47] and march he had to do something he
[37:49] couldn't just sit home he had to do
[37:51] something to show forth lord i am with
[37:54] you and he said i wrote down something
[37:56] that said don't lay down and take it
[37:59] rise up and fight
[38:01] many of times we get to a certain
[38:02] situation where gideon had got to the
[38:04] point i'm just going to hide this food
[38:06] and hopefully it won't get stolen i'm
[38:09] just going to sit back and try to make
[38:11] him make this me what it able what what
[38:14] i'm able to meet here but god wanted him
[38:16] to rise up and fight
[38:18] so that he can get all the blessings
[38:20] that god was giving him not just a
[38:21] portion where he was going to hide it
[38:23] from people and and have to be by the
[38:26] wine press with his portion and
[38:28] hopefully and make it through and it
[38:30] won't get noticed god wanted to give him
[38:32] so much more but he had to rise up and
[38:34] fight and believe that victory was his
[38:38] he had to
[38:39] believe that victory was for him
[38:42] and then and that's what it says here
[38:44] and the scripture says in
[38:47] in romans 8
[38:49] and romans 8 i'll read the scripture
[38:54] roman romans 8 and 28
[38:59] it's a very familiar scripture
[39:02] romans 8 and 28 and when you got to say
[39:05] amen
[39:07] and it reads and we know that all things
[39:09] work together for the good to them that
[39:11] love god to them who are called
[39:13] according to his purpose for him he did
[39:16] for know he also did predestinate to be
[39:18] conformed to the image of his son that
[39:20] he might be the first one among among
[39:23] many and i'll go down to the 34 first
[39:26] verse he said what shall we say to these
[39:28] things if god be for us who can be
[39:32] against us and and it takes it says if
[39:35] god before you who can be against you so
[39:37] you don't have to fear being able to
[39:39] rise and up and fight in your enemy you
[39:41] don't have to be afraid that your enemy
[39:42] is going to defeat you because of god
[39:44] before you who can be against you
[39:46] there's nothing that can stand in your
[39:48] way if god is on your side you turn to
[39:51] somebody and say i am
[39:54] victorious
[39:55] turn around to somebody else because
[39:57] they might not have believed you and say
[39:58] i am
[40:00] victorious and that's what you got to
[40:02] understand that you are victorious in
[40:04] jesus christ because god is with you
[40:07] yes there's nothing that can stand in
[40:09] your way when god is with you so you
[40:11] just got to stand up and fight you're
[40:13] not going to defeat the devil by laying
[40:15] down and taking what he gives you you're
[40:17] not going to defeat the devil by just
[40:19] sitting on the wayside and sitting and
[40:21] wallowing in depression
[40:23] you're not gonna defeat the devil if you
[40:26] continue to take his anxiety with you
[40:28] you're not gonna defeat him if you just
[40:30] sit by and allow the devil to beat you
[40:32] up
[40:33] but at some point in time you gotta get
[40:35] sick and tired of being defeated by the
[40:37] devil and believe that lord i'm going to
[40:39] take you by the word that you gave me
[40:42] and i'm going to fight i'm going to rise
[40:44] up and i'm going to fight because i am
[40:47] victorious that's not a maybe that's not
[40:49] a might be god you already undefeated
[40:52] the devil at calvary so i don't have to
[40:54] worry about that the devil is going to
[40:55] defeat me i am victorious that's
[40:58] something that i have to repeat every
[41:00] single day because the devil is going to
[41:02] continue to fight you every single day
[41:04] then i wrote down something self if you
[41:06] give god more he will keep you
[41:09] the more you give god the more he will
[41:11] keep you the more you give him all of
[41:13] your life the more he is able to keep
[41:16] you god can keep you from everything
[41:18] that you may go through in life
[41:20] and just knowing that whatever if god
[41:23] before you who can be against you your
[41:25] path is laid before you
[41:27] and understanding that this battle is
[41:30] not yours
[41:31] you're trying to fight it with things
[41:32] and trying to do this and do that and
[41:34] all you got to do is go down on your
[41:36] knees and get closer to god that's all
[41:38] you got to do every single day is lord i
[41:41] need your help because i'm not going to
[41:43] make it
[41:44] i won't make it all by myself if it's
[41:47] not for you that's leading me and
[41:49] guiding me each and every day lord jesus
[41:52] if it's not you standing by my side each
[41:54] and every day then i won't make it there
[41:56] was a song that i heard the other day
[41:58] and it said down on my knees when
[42:01] troubles rise i'll talk with jesus
[42:04] beyond the sky said he promised me that
[42:07] he would hear my plea and i would tell
[42:09] him down on my knees and it was
[42:12] something that ran wrong in my heart and
[42:14] said lord i got to get closer and go
[42:16] down on my knees i got to go down
[42:18] because lord you promised that you would
[42:20] hear my plea if i go down on my seat and
[42:23] i will tell them all about it down on my
[42:25] knees that lord that you are my strength
[42:28] you are my provider you are my healer
[42:31] you are my keeper when i'm in trouble
[42:34] lord you're able to deliver me because
[42:36] lord you can do everything that i need
[42:38] each and every day of my life lord i
[42:41] need you even more every day and some
[42:44] came to me and said you got to fight
[42:46] you got to fight for what you believe in
[42:49] we look at the people over there in
[42:50] ukraine they thought it was going to be
[42:52] an easy battle but they never considered
[42:55] that someone was going to fight for
[42:57] their homeland someone was going to
[42:59] fight for what they believed in it
[43:01] wasn't nothing that could tear you away
[43:03] from what what you believe in if you
[43:05] believe that god has given you the
[43:07] victory then you will never stop
[43:09] fighting
[43:10] if you believe that god has given you
[43:12] everything that you need then you'll
[43:14] never stop fighting even if the devil
[43:16] knocks you down if the devil beats you
[43:19] in a battle that don't mean he won the
[43:20] war
[43:21] just because he won one battle don't
[43:23] mean that he won the war with you and
[43:25] god can deliver you up out of everything
[43:27] that you go through it's just
[43:29] understanding that i gotta rise up and i
[43:32] gotta fight
[43:33] i gotta take up my my sword and my
[43:36] shield of faith and my helmet of
[43:38] salvation my sword that is the word of
[43:40] god and i got to fight the only way to
[43:43] to defeat the devil is with the word of
[43:44] god so i got to know what the word of
[43:47] god is to defeat the devil if you don't
[43:49] know it then you can't defeat him so you
[43:51] got to study you got to pray and you got
[43:53] to know god for yourself in order to
[43:55] understand that lord if you before me
[43:58] then who can be against me all i got to
[44:01] do is rise up and fight so it takes some
[44:03] action
[44:05] to in order to get some reactions and if
[44:08] you want to see the devil run you got to
[44:10] you got to do something
[44:13] otherwise the devil is going to sit back
[44:14] there and he don't have to fight you
[44:17] he don't have to move because you ain't
[44:19] doing nothing to move him you ain't
[44:21] doing nothing to say well i don't want
[44:24] you you sitting over there and say lord
[44:26] well devil you can sit there stay
[44:27] comfortable let me go get you a blanket
[44:29] you can lay down and take your time and
[44:32] i'll just deal with this
[44:34] for the rest of my life
[44:36] i can i i think i can take this for the
[44:38] rest of my life when god want to give
[44:40] you complete victory
[44:42] he wanted to give you he wanted the
[44:43] devil to not even be in your
[44:45] neighborhood
[44:46] not even be in your vicinity but you you
[44:48] laid a nice good place and the devil
[44:50] said i'll take my oh thank you
[44:52] thank you let me sit down and
[44:54] rest a little while
[44:56] when what you want is to rise up and
[44:58] fight him and say you can't stay here
[45:01] you can't live here this is not your
[45:03] home this is not the place that you need
[45:05] to be comfortable if anything i don't
[45:07] want you around even in my vicinity lord
[45:10] i want to stand up and rise up and fight
[45:13] lord i want to use your word to defeat
[45:15] every demon that's coming against me and
[45:18] every devil that may come to harm me i
[45:20] want to rise up and fight
[45:23] there's so much excuse me there's so
[45:25] much that
[45:26] that was coming and said jesus has
[45:29] already won the battle
[45:30] so you don't have to worry about being
[45:32] victorious you don't have to worry that
[45:34] you won't make it that you want that you
[45:37] won't defeat this devil because jesus
[45:39] has already won that battle
[45:42] he's already won and he won it back at
[45:44] calvary when he died for your sins
[45:46] everything he knew what you was going to
[45:48] do before you even got here he knew
[45:50] where you was going to be before you
[45:52] ever got here and he knew that he could
[45:54] save you from whatever you was going
[45:56] through he knew that he went there and
[45:58] he died and he said you was worth saving
[46:01] you was worth me dying on the cross
[46:04] taking those whips taking those lashes
[46:06] you were worth it
[46:07] if if you don't believe it all you got
[46:09] to do is say lord i am worth it he might
[46:12] not have done it for nobody else but he
[46:13] did it for me and i can rest on that i
[46:16] can stand assured that lord you did it
[46:18] for me and if he can do it for me i know
[46:20] he can do it for you
[46:22] because if god before you who can be
[46:23] against you
[46:25] and understanding that you can't lay
[46:27] down and take it you got to rise up and
[46:30] fight
[46:31] it's too late in the hour and too late
[46:33] in the evening where you can just
[46:35] sitting back and relaxing
[46:37] just understanding that
[46:38] we
[46:39] we got to understand that we can rise up
[46:41] and fight
[46:43] we can
[46:44] we can rise up and fight because god has
[46:46] already given us to victory
[46:48] the devil only wants to distract you and
[46:51] hinder you from believing that you have
[46:53] the victory the devil cannot not say
[46:55] that you don't have the victory he can
[46:56] only make you doubt that you have the
[46:58] victory he can only make you doubt that
[47:00] god won't do what he said he will do he
[47:03] could only make you doubt that god is
[47:04] not a healer so that you stay sick he
[47:08] can only make you doubt that god isn't a
[47:10] provider so that you continue to be
[47:12] dependent god can only make you the
[47:14] devil can only make you doubt that but
[47:16] god has said i will supply all your
[47:18] needs
[47:19] so if god gave you a need he said i'll
[47:21] be the supplier of it if god get if god
[47:24] gave you these things he if he gave you
[47:26] a sickness then he said that i will be
[47:28] the healer
[47:29] if he gave if he gave you many different
[47:31] trials and tribulations god said i can
[47:33] deliver you out of the mall
[47:35] and just understanding that we have to
[47:37] rise up and fight we have to rise up and
[47:40] i wanted to read something
[47:42] that i had down here
[47:45] amen
[47:55] and it says and how they would had done
[47:58] the israelites the philistines and the
[47:59] midianites the amorites and all the
[48:02] different ones that come in like locusts
[48:04] and just eat up what they had and take
[48:07] it out and go on but did you notice they
[48:10] cannot do that until the israelites
[48:12] first fell away from god the devil can't
[48:15] set a foot on you to hurt you until
[48:18] first you get away from god you must
[48:20] first remember that check when anything
[48:23] happens see if you are in the faith or
[48:25] not
[48:26] see that you're right up to the place
[48:29] with god then remember the devil can do
[48:31] you no harm you're in christ
[48:35] when you are in christ the devil cannot
[48:37] bother you he cannot hinder you he
[48:39] cannot stop you from getting what god
[48:40] has
[48:41] given you but it's somewhere along the
[48:43] line you have to check your life and say
[48:45] am i in the faith
[48:47] am i in the faith am i am i doing what
[48:49] god has ordained for me to do
[48:52] it it says but time has come for action
[48:55] and that's the same now the time has
[48:57] come for action the time had come when
[48:59] playing church had come to a halt with
[49:01] god there was no there was more playing
[49:04] there was no more playing church we must
[49:06] get down to business i trust that's the
[49:08] same that god will place this upon the
[49:10] hearts of the people tonight that it's
[49:12] time to help playing church
[49:14] playing religion playing righteousness
[49:17] now it's time for action
[49:19] now it's time for us to rise up and
[49:21] fight now it's time to fight for the
[49:24] ones that can't fight for themselves now
[49:26] it's time to stand in the gap for the
[49:28] ones that can't stand in the gap for
[49:29] themselves that may be gone too far but
[49:32] if you believe you can turn to somebody
[49:34] and say i am victorious you can turn to
[49:37] somebody and say lord they are
[49:39] victorious because i believe that you
[49:41] said in your word that you would that
[49:44] you would deliver them out of everything
[49:45] that they going through so i'm going to
[49:47] stand in the gap and believe for them
[49:49] even though they may not believe for
[49:51] themselves but i believe for them until
[49:53] one day the light bulb may come on and
[49:55] when it comes on i don't have to worry
[49:57] about a thing because they realize that
[49:59] god who if god is for them who can be
[50:02] against them if god is for them he can
[50:04] deliver them out of them out of
[50:06] everything that they're going through so
[50:08] i so you got to understand that maybe
[50:10] you fighting for somebody else you may
[50:12] be uplifting and by your fight you
[50:14] showing for us what god can do for
[50:16] somebody else they may not be following
[50:18] what you're doing but they're watching
[50:20] they may not be saying that i i'm gonna
[50:23] follow that path but they watching your
[50:25] path
[50:26] they're looking to see what you're going
[50:28] to do when your battle hits you
[50:30] they're looking to see how you're going
[50:32] to react when the devil fights you
[50:35] how are you going to react to this
[50:36] situation and they're like
[50:38] let's see if he in the faith or not
[50:40] because you profess to be a christian
[50:42] but let me see if your life lines up
[50:44] with what you what you say
[50:46] let me see if if you truly believe what
[50:49] you speak about when you got that
[50:51] headache do you believe that god can
[50:52] deliver you from that headache or are
[50:54] you right there popping pills with
[50:56] everybody else
[50:58] that's when you understand that god has
[51:00] the ability to to give you everything
[51:03] that you stand in need of when you
[51:06] understand that god has the ability that
[51:08] he has already defeated everything that
[51:10] you will face
[51:12] then you then you walk with a new
[51:13] authority
[51:14] you walk with a new joy you walk with a
[51:17] new step because you understand that god
[51:19] has given me everything the bible says
[51:21] that every every every place that your
[51:24] foot of your soul tread on god has given
[51:26] unto you when you understand that every
[51:29] place that he's that you walk on god
[51:31] gave it to you and it's yours you don't
[51:33] have to question whether it's yours or
[51:34] not you know it's yours
[51:36] when you go to your house and you don't
[51:37] bought your house you ain't wondering
[51:39] how to get in the door you're going
[51:40] right there put the key in there and
[51:42] you're opening the door because why is
[51:44] yours
[51:45] you ain't got to worry about somebody
[51:46] else being there because it's yours
[51:49] and when something is yours you have
[51:50] ownership over it you have ownership
[51:53] that this is mine i can take it when i
[51:55] want if it's your car i can go wherever
[51:57] i want in it i can stop wherever i want
[52:00] i can eat in it i can drink it i can do
[52:02] whatever i want because it's mine
[52:04] and you got to understand that's the way
[52:06] your situations are if god has given you
[52:09] the victory then it's your victory you
[52:11] don't have to wait on it in the wait to
[52:13] come you can speak the word over your
[52:15] situation and say that i am victorious
[52:18] i yeah victoria i may not see the
[52:20] victory happening right now but i am
[52:22] victorious and i will rest on that and
[52:24] hold on to it that god i am victorious
[52:27] no matter what situation i'm going
[52:29] through i am victorious i'm not waiting
[52:32] on victory to happen i am victorious and
[52:35] i can speak the word and rest assured
[52:37] that it's going to happen it may not
[52:39] happen today it may not happen tomorrow
[52:41] brother branham he spoke about the story
[52:43] of the man that got
[52:45] that was blind and he went up in the
[52:47] prayer line and brother branham prayed
[52:49] for him and he and he said and and came
[52:52] back in the prayer line again and he
[52:54] said i can't see yet
[52:56] and brother branham said did you believe
[52:58] he said yes he said well then go on if
[53:01] you believe then you shall receive your
[53:03] sight
[53:04] well he kept going on and he left the
[53:06] meeting and he went back and he was he
[53:08] was on the street selling newspapers i
[53:10] believe the story says
[53:12] and he and he and everyone he told when
[53:16] everybody when everybody met him he said
[53:18] i can see
[53:19] he said i can see he couldn't see but he
[53:22] said i can see because he believed that
[53:24] he could see and one day he got in the
[53:26] barber chair and then the barber was
[53:28] sitting there and he said he said what
[53:30] you say you can see he said i can see
[53:32] the barber was about to laugh at him and
[53:34] then all of a sudden he said i can see
[53:36] and his eyes popped open he went running
[53:38] out that barber chair because one day
[53:41] what he confessed became reality
[53:43] what he was confessing became reality
[53:46] that's why words are so important in the
[53:48] way that you use them the way that you
[53:50] use them each and every day if you if
[53:52] you speak negative things then you never
[53:54] get better you'll never have positive
[53:56] things happening to you but you got to
[53:58] speak the word you got to speak things
[54:00] like i am victorious no matter if i'm
[54:03] down and now i am victorious because god
[54:05] has brought me through and i he will
[54:07] continue to bring me through amen
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:28] rise up and fight amen
[54:30] y'all appreciate the word tonight
[54:35] i thank the lord for that you know i've
[54:36] been looking at
[54:38] uh this last week in the half
[54:40] going over david and and
[54:43] you know he's saying rise up and fight i
[54:45] said david rose up and fought didn't he
[54:48] you know as a little boy
[54:49] saying the thing is that
[54:51] you know
[54:52] what when goliath was out there that
[54:54] situation
[54:56] and saul and all his men was out there
[54:58] trembling
[54:59] david came in but he had testimonies to
[55:01] solve what faith in god would do
[55:04] and i was thinking about how i said that
[55:06] little boy when you saw that lion and
[55:08] that bear the bible says david told him
[55:11] i got the lamb from him and he when he
[55:13] rose up against me i caught him by the
[55:14] beard
[55:16] i said how close he had to be to that
[55:17] animal to catch him by the beard and he
[55:20] said i slew him but i said what it is
[55:22] showing you what faith in god will do
[55:24] not only that it says when he went out
[55:26] to goliath and he told goliath he said
[55:28] you coming to me with word with sword
[55:30] and spirits he said but i'm coming into
[55:32] to you in the name of the lord of hosts
[55:35] and i said you know it's something about
[55:37] we know that name come on and it's power
[55:39] in that name ain't it
[55:41] it's a difference of how you come
[55:43] how many believe that well i said i like
[55:46] how i was thinking about when caleb
[55:47] brother caleb was speaking tonight to
[55:49] rise up and fight he says like he said
[55:51] the god already fought the battle for
[55:53] you and i thought about how david told
[55:56] goliath he says that the battle
[55:58] the battle is the lord's
[56:00] and he says and after this day the whole
[56:02] earth gonna know that there's a god in
[56:04] israel
[56:05] and i thought about that i said i looked
[56:07] at our situation today
[56:09] and you know we're looking here now to
[56:10] take a rapture
[56:12] but what it is we fighting in the
[56:13] goliath and david and goliath type
[56:15] situations in our lives ain't we but
[56:17] what it is what will faith in god do i
[56:20] was sharing with my son moses the other
[56:22] day i said you know was talking and how
[56:24] everybody's saying you know we on the
[56:26] break of world war three and i says that
[56:29] you know you got to know god for
[56:30] yourself
[56:31] i says that you know you got to get the
[56:33] holy ghost for yourself and i said that
[56:35] we started we started going over the
[56:37] holy ghost and all and it says what it
[56:39] is you know the bible says to repent
[56:41] that's the first thing
[56:43] a lot of people don't even believe they
[56:44] need repentance today some in the church
[56:47] don't believe they don't see the need
[56:48] for it the prophet of god says but when
[56:50] you don't see the need for it then
[56:52] you're in worse shape than the people
[56:53] out in the street at least the man out
[56:55] in the street know what kind of shape he
[56:57] in come on do you believe that what i
[56:59] say is that you you got to repent and
[57:02] the bible says be baptized in the name
[57:04] of the lord jesus for remission of your
[57:06] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[57:08] the holy ghost it's not nothing hard but
[57:11] it's a what it's a promise that god gave
[57:13] you how do you receive the holy ghost by
[57:15] doing what god said and believing on the
[57:17] promise that he gave you and the thing
[57:19] is the devil put all kind of things in
[57:21] your mind you can't let the devil do
[57:23] that to you why because you living by a
[57:25] promise that god gave so when you raise
[57:27] your hands when you when you raise your
[57:29] hands you praising god you say lord
[57:31] thank you for the promise because god
[57:33] made you a promise and ain't no devil in
[57:35] hell that can stop that promise from
[57:37] coming to pass because almighty god
[57:40] spoke his word and they can't return
[57:42] back to them void
[57:43] hallelujah and i said that that's what
[57:45] it is i said what are we living by today
[57:47] a promise that god made why ain't your
[57:50] heart fearing like the rest of the world
[57:52] because of promises that god made come
[57:54] on that heaven and earth to pass away
[57:56] but his word won't pass away that i'm
[57:58] engraved in the palm of his hand and
[58:00] nobody can't take him out that even
[58:02] though he's the world i might die this
[58:04] body might be lost but i know that my
[58:06] soul is in god's hand and he said i'm
[58:08] going away to prepare a place for you
[58:10] that where i am you might be also why
[58:12] you so happy on the mister break of
[58:15] world war iii because of a promise that
[58:17] god made me and i know that god is going
[58:19] to keep his promise i'm still shouting
[58:21] i'm still dancing i'm still praising god
[58:24] in the midst of the break of world war
[58:26] three because of a promise that god made
[58:28] me
[58:29] you know i thought about this week
[58:31] preaching on the seed of abraham
[58:33] come on and how god promised abraham he
[58:37] was gonna bless his seed didn't he
[58:39] he said in blessing i'ma bless you and
[58:41] multiply multiply thy seed he said and
[58:44] they'll possess the gates of the enemy
[58:46] god is gonna fight against those that
[58:47] fought against them he gave abraham a
[58:50] promise didn't he now we look at that
[58:52] even the scripture says that didn't just
[58:54] go to the natural seed but to those that
[58:56] are the spiritual household of faith to
[58:58] all that can believe so i said that
[59:01] those promises those are your promises
[59:04] what are you fearing about tonight what
[59:06] are you lacking tonight let's say it
[59:07] like that because god has gave you a
[59:09] promise
[59:10] how are you gonna make this journey
[59:12] through by the promises of god come on
[59:15] they shall overcome by the blood of the
[59:17] lamb
[59:18] and the word of their what testimony
[59:20] what are we testifying about
[59:23] that god is keeping his promises
[59:25] god is still saving god is still healing
[59:28] he's still delivering
[59:29] come on in your situation i was telling
[59:32] my wife yesterday was talking about a
[59:34] situation i said you got to have faith
[59:36] in god sometime
[59:39] come on you got to turn your faith loose
[59:42] as the pastor was preaching and see what
[59:44] god would do sometime
[59:46] come on
[59:47] how many believe that tonight i'm
[59:49] stirred amen i just i said thank the
[59:51] lord you know i was
[59:53] thanking the lord for brother caleb
[59:55] tonight and you know for just pouring
[59:57] out his heart it's something to
[59:58] encourage us i believe that we need
[1:00:01] encouraging in this hour
[1:00:03] because of what's going on if you listen
[1:00:05] to the news and everything around it to
[1:00:07] do what bog you down in depression won't
[1:00:09] it but we need encouragement to let us
[1:00:11] know that hey when we see these things
[1:00:13] we need to rejoice
[1:00:15] jesus was talking to the people in his
[1:00:17] in in the days when he was walking the
[1:00:19] earth back in the flesh and he was
[1:00:21] telling them that then when they asked
[1:00:22] him what shall be the the the end and
[1:00:25] the sign of that coming all these things
[1:00:27] and he began to tell them about the wars
[1:00:29] the rumors of wars pestilence diverse
[1:00:32] places and all these things going on but
[1:00:34] then he began to tell him but i don't
[1:00:35] want you to fear
[1:00:37] i don't want you to be afraid he said
[1:00:40] because that world it's going to be evil
[1:00:42] but he said i i cut short the time for
[1:00:44] the elect's sake
[1:00:46] come on and i believe that if he cut
[1:00:48] short time for the elect's sake then
[1:00:50] he's going to take care of his elect the
[1:00:52] bombs might fall but god going to take
[1:00:54] care of his elect i don't know about you
[1:00:56] but i says i'm looking for my future

[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:30] rise up and fight amen
[1:05:32] you know
[1:05:34] i was talking i think that was me and
[1:05:36] rem wolf
[1:05:38] i said life is past fast
[1:05:42] we approaching that big seven of them
[1:05:45] life is passing fast
[1:05:48] if you knew how many you remember when
[1:05:50] you were the baby
[1:06:03] see i wanted to act like i thought
[1:06:05] that'll wake up somebody you remember
[1:06:07] when you was a baby but you did most of
[1:06:10] us can't remember when we were babies
[1:06:14] but somebody in here
[1:06:16] probably can remember when you was a
[1:06:18] baby
[1:06:21] especially the children
[1:06:23] your parents can remember when you was a
[1:06:25] baby
[1:06:27] and now you might be
[1:06:29] 10 12 15.
[1:06:32] 16
[1:06:33] 20 30.
[1:06:35] but somebody remember when you was a
[1:06:37] baby
[1:06:40] time
[1:06:43] one thing about when you get a little
[1:06:45] age on you
[1:06:46] life began to get so short
[1:06:50] and you realize how rapid it is it's so
[1:06:53] fast
[1:06:56] and you never knew
[1:06:59] that life was going to be so short
[1:07:03] that's why it says
[1:07:06] a few days a man that's born of a woman
[1:07:09] of a few days full of trouble if you
[1:07:11] knew
[1:07:12] that it it's going to be that show
[1:07:16] then you'll give it all to jesus
[1:07:19] because it it's just a little it's just
[1:07:21] a little space
[1:07:23] you blank your eyes
[1:07:26] and you 70 years old
[1:07:30] and then you look back what did i do
[1:07:32] between
[1:07:34] the dash
[1:07:38] what did i do
[1:07:39] what did i do in life
[1:07:41] that was valuable
[1:07:45] what did i do in life that was
[1:07:47] meaningful
[1:07:49] just what did i achieve and what did i
[1:07:51] accomplish
[1:07:55] all the worldly things of vanity
[1:07:59] well i played football i did this i did
[1:08:03] that that ain't nothing
[1:08:08] because why it won't mean nothing
[1:08:10] because you can't carry that across the
[1:08:13] on the other side
[1:08:15] somebody said when i got rich i became a
[1:08:17] millionaire what good is he going to do
[1:08:19] yet
[1:08:21] well
[1:08:22] i sometimes we're glad that we achieved
[1:08:25] certain goals
[1:08:27] finish school
[1:08:29] you did this you did that
[1:08:31] we thankful to god for that
[1:08:34] but i'm gonna tell you something way
[1:08:35] greater than that
[1:08:37] the prophet of god says california he
[1:08:38] said that in the 60s he said california
[1:08:41] was sinking so many um
[1:08:45] i think he i don't know how high
[1:08:49] the word it but he said it was sinking
[1:08:50] every day every day so many inches of
[1:08:54] california so much of california was
[1:08:57] sinking
[1:08:58] you see you'll find out later
[1:09:00] so if it's sinking every day look how
[1:09:03] long it's been
[1:09:05] next thing you know california you're
[1:09:06] just gradually sinking under the ocean
[1:09:11] and i'm saying
[1:09:13] when the earthquake hit japan the other
[1:09:15] day i think it was japan that hit
[1:09:20] and that west coast is just shaking
[1:09:24] the whole world is shaking
[1:09:27] everything is shaking
[1:09:29] brother and sister
[1:09:31] everything is unstable
[1:09:35] life
[1:09:36] if you
[1:09:37] if the young children here knew that
[1:09:40] even if you got to be 70 years old
[1:09:43] it's gonna pass
[1:09:45] like that
[1:09:49] so you got to take advantage
[1:09:52] of life itself
[1:09:54] lord how can i please you
[1:09:57] everything you do
[1:09:59] lord how can i please you
[1:10:04] he's he should be the sinner
[1:10:08] he should be the first
[1:10:10] how can i please you
[1:10:14] if you don't do that now
[1:10:17] you'll look back and you'll wonder
[1:10:20] i was just
[1:10:22] see solomon at the end of the journey he
[1:10:24] said vanity vanity said to preach all
[1:10:27] his vanity
[1:10:30] but that was at the end of his journey
[1:10:32] he looked back and he saw
[1:10:34] he had 700 wives 300 concubines
[1:10:39] was called the wisest man
[1:10:42] on earth and all that but all of that
[1:10:45] at the end
[1:10:50] he said to the young people serve the
[1:10:52] lord in the days
[1:10:54] thy youth
[1:10:56] when the evil day
[1:11:00] because one day the evil day is gonna
[1:11:01] approach
[1:11:02] one day you got to die
[1:11:05] okay god bless you god bless you tonight

[1:13:29] for your coming
[1:13:31] i want to give uh reverend ruffa
[1:13:34] a chance to greet us and say something
[1:13:36] to us whatever's on his heart
[1:13:39] go right ahead
[1:13:41] you can come up or you can stand back
[1:13:42] there either way you want to
[1:13:50] so
[1:14:08] what's been already said
[1:14:11] this come from the book of hebrew
[1:14:15] it says
[1:14:17] in verse 13
[1:14:19] chapter five
[1:14:22] i was just reading over
[1:14:25] and there's a lot of power behind it
[1:14:28] it says for everyone that uses milk
[1:14:32] is unskillful in the word of
[1:14:34] righteousness
[1:14:36] for he is a babe
[1:14:39] but strong
[1:14:41] belongs to them
[1:14:44] that are of full age
[1:14:46] even those who by reason
[1:14:49] of use
[1:14:50] have their senses exercised
[1:14:52] to discern
[1:14:54] both good and evil
[1:14:57] a lot of people say that they don't want
[1:14:59] to hear nothing but the truth
[1:15:03] that's one of the biggest lies they've
[1:15:04] been told
[1:15:05] because when you tell them the truth
[1:15:08] they run
[1:15:10] they don't want to hear
[1:15:13] you're saying things that
[1:15:15] step on their toes
[1:15:17] they go from church to church
[1:15:20] they start lying
[1:15:22] running
[1:15:24] being a coward rather than facing
[1:15:26] facts
[1:15:28] i'm glad i came
[1:15:30] because i heard two young men
[1:15:34] that deliver
[1:15:36] a real good message
[1:15:39] always understand that truth the books
[1:15:41] of the truth
[1:15:43] shall set you free
[1:15:45] do you know how many slaves it is
[1:15:47] to hearing things that they want to hear
[1:15:50] and not what they need to hear
[1:15:53] the truth
[1:15:55] shall set you free
[1:15:57] i would rather be free

[1:16:02] and i thank brother simon for
[1:16:03] giving me an opportunity
[1:16:05] to share
[1:16:06] such things because y'all got to find

[1:16:18] one of your sons
[1:16:20] that's enter that's interested in the
[1:16:23] in the ministry
[1:16:25] remember that
[1:16:27] he said you know
[1:16:29] i ain't real sure
[1:16:31] but i can't tell because i just seen one
[1:16:35] he did a good job

[1:16:40] i would say that too
[1:16:44] that's being honest that's been truthful
[1:16:46] and that's being scraped if you can't
[1:16:49] see i'm the kind of person that i don't

[1:16:53] that's gonna agree with everything i say
[1:16:56] i don't need a yes ma'am
[1:16:58] i need for you to challenge me and let
[1:17:00] me know when i'm wrong i talked to him
[1:17:03] just the other day about some language i
[1:17:05] used
[1:17:07] at a eulogy but i was out of turn he
[1:17:10] said my daughter had to teach me
[1:17:12] how to be humble
[1:17:14] and not use that kind of rhetoric
[1:17:17] so we counseled each other to
[1:17:20] a degree and then we came up together
[1:17:22] set a newspaper
[1:17:25] who knew that we would be in the
[1:17:26] position that we're in because we've
[1:17:28] been friends
[1:17:30] for i know
[1:17:32] almost
[1:17:33] 60 years
[1:17:35] 50 years
[1:17:37] because he was a newspaper
[1:17:39] he was in third grade
[1:17:41] had a job
[1:17:43] hustling
[1:17:45] knew what the value of

[1:17:48] help himself

[1:17:57] and then his wife
[1:17:58] the beautiful person
[1:18:01] to have three children
[1:18:03] and all them three children
[1:18:05] are successful in the fields that they
[1:18:08] went in
[1:18:09] and actually was homes
[1:18:11] by their mother is a terrific thing

[1:25:09] he said well brother simmons ain't done
[1:25:11] this i would have done it if you'd have
[1:25:13] told me
[1:25:14] probably say oh i don't believe he gonna
[1:25:16] do it see that's what the devil does
[1:25:19] tell you well i don't think he's gonna
[1:25:20] listen to me
[1:25:22] don't
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:25] you know
[1:25:27] don't don't do that

[1:25:59] if god want it done it's going to be
[1:26:01] done
