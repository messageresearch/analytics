said we're in perilous times when they in other words they have lost hope so when they lose hope they'll do they get in panic mode and when they get desperate they're doing reckless things and i believe that the world is getting ready to get reckless if something don't turn around with this pandemic they're talking about shutting down the country again brother and sister how much more can we stand how many more hurricanes how many more earthquakes how many more floods how much more can we stand can the economy yet stand with another shutdown can our bacon banking system can the hospitals take another crisis the emergency room the intensive care units can the first responders take much more than they're taking their part of the country is on fire we're suffering so many intensified blows so much is happening everywhere i said brothers and sisters time for us to get desperate we find that faith love is faith incentive without love amen faith amen cannot operate in its full capacity if you want god your faith to operate then you need god's love you need agape love and when you have love you can get your faith to act and to move but we find out because god's servant said it's not enough love we want god to do great things but they met the prophet god says is not enough love the people of god does not have enough love to get the faith to be moving brother and sister we need more love as i was praying and looking let's go to judges six for a moment we got to get desperate i believe gideon had come to a time that things was getting bad and he probably came to a place he didn't know how to deal with the situations brother and sister when we don't know what to do it's time to pray and he said the factual fervent prayer of a righteous man avail as much it's not enough to pray but the affection fearing prayer amen god is a god that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities probably god oftentimes said when he praying for a sick person he has to feel sometimes he feels what a mother must be going through with the child is sick and dying and his compassion goes out that's him amen contacting the love for that child the love for that individual we don't pray like we ought to pray because we don't have the love for amen one another when you really love somebody amen you really stand in the gap the prophet said the love that we have for god that calls us amen to pray we'll pray for this nation we'll pray for this country we'll pray for one another if we got the love of god but we find ourselves void of praying especially affection forever you can't hardly get people to pray now oh yes they'll pray when it's too late their pray after the loved ones are gone but to get detriment now brother and sister what it's going to take for us to get desperate here let me just look at judges six here for a moment and the children are illegal did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hands of millions seven years praise god the mid in and the hands of the midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them dens which are in the mountain and caves and strongholds praise god they were hiding they're scared brothers and sisters they were high and they were scared they were afraid and so it was when israel had sown that the million million knights came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them and then count against them and destroyed the increase of the earth to thou come to gaza and left no substance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitudes for both they and their camels were without number and they were entered into the land to destroy it and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children were illegal cried unto the lord and it came to pass when the children of ildra cried unto the lord because of dominion nights that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i bought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hands of the egyptian and out of the hands of all that oppress you and raid them out before you and gave you their land and i say unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites and whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the lord and set under the oak which was an offer that pertained it unto josh the azerite and the son of gideon and his son gideon thrust in wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared to him said unto him the lord is with thee the mighty man of valor and gigan said unto him o my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of sin did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites it's something to look at the condition of god's people god's people had come to a state that god had delivered them because they had done evil [Music] they had done evil in the sight of the lord and god had delivered him up into the hands of the midianites and the malachites and so forth children of the east sometimes we suffer because we have done evil in the sight of the lord some of our problems is not amen because we've been so good and because we have lived the way we ought to live sometimes we go through uh certain things because they meant the evil in which we've done but nevertheless god amen had given the they meant the uh million knights in the in the children of the east and a time period and i want to say when you began to cry to god and you began to lift up your voice in desperation and you began to get down to business with god and you began to talk it over with god god i need to get desperate i don't know about you but i'm not satisfied with my spiritual condition i believe that uh that i can get closer to god than i am see amen you look around and you can see what the media knights and the amalekites and the children of the east what they are doing to the children of israel i don't know amen if you have a million nights problems and amulet kites problems and amen i don't know if you have the children or the east amen that's trying to make you impoverished i don't know amen what kind uh uh of spirits amen because amen they dealt with the natural what we are dealing with spiritual things and i'm sure that those same demons that work on them and physical realm is working on the they met the church in the spirit those demons amen that you seem amen they meant to be afraid of and they seem to make you impoverished amen i want to tell you something brother a sister they meant that the million nights uh amen and not your problems the amalekites are not your problems the amalekites are not your problems and the children of east is not your problem but your main problem and your main enemy is yourself are you with me if you can recognize your real problem amen does not lie relax it's not from without it's from within many times we want to blame somebody else getting an even talked uh the angel called him a mighty man of ballard but he began to reply amen uh amen if uh god be with us then i want to know where is his miracles i want to know amen why are we going through what we're going through if god is with us then why amen are we impoverished amen i know amen that i believe in my heart that god has forsaken us i heard him say that look like god has forsook for sick forsaken us and forgot about us i believe sometimes people they may believe that god is gone somewhere when he promised that i'll never leave you and i never will forsake you amen but yet in his mind what he was confronted with he believed that god had forsook him god was not there i need you lord i need you god amen your children need your lord why are you lord the prophet came and told him amen told him that uh in i want you to know that you you're a mighty man of valor i want you to understand the thing that causes you to be defeated i know amen you look at the amen uh the the grass and the the enemy like grasshoppers all around and they meant look like there's no victory in sight you need to stop looking at uh amen the the the enemy from without that and look at yourself amen so he told him in verse 10 he said and said i am the lord your god i want you to come back and i want you to know that i am the lord yoga are you with me see you got to let that sink in i am the lord your god amen fear not amen that's what's the matter amen
