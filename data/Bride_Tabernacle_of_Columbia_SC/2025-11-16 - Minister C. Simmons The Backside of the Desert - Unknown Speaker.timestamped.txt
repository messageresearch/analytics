[34:38] Oh, and I can walk [music] again.
[34:42] Oh, it's the highway [screaming]

[34:52] Oh, cuz it's the highway

[35:50] way this morning. Amen.
[35:53] [music]
[35:54] Amen. Let us all bow.
[35:58] [music]
[35:59] Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us
[36:01] to be in your house this morning. Lord,
[36:03] we're walking up the King's Highway.
[36:05] Lord, we want you to come down in our
[36:07] midst, Lord Jesus. move us out of the
[36:10] way, Lord, that you may get all the
[36:11] glory, the honor, and the praise. Lord,
[36:13] we thank you for what you've done. We
[36:15] thank you for what you're doing, and we
[36:17] ask that you come down and continue to
[36:19] move. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[36:26] Amen. If you got your Bibles this
[36:27] morning, we'll turn to the book of
[36:30] Exodus.
[36:38] How many glad to be in the house of the
[36:39] Lord this morning?
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 3 and we will start
[36:57] in verse one.
[36:59] When you got it, say amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads,
[37:06] "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[37:10] father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and
[37:13] he led the flock to the backside of the
[37:15] desert, and came to the mountain of God,
[37:18] even to Horeb. And the angel
[37:22] and the angel of the Lord appeared upon
[37:25] unto unto him in a flame of fire out of
[37:29] the midst of the bush. And he looked,
[37:31] and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[37:34] and the bush was not consumed. And Moses
[37:37] said, "I will now turn aside and see
[37:40] this great sight,
[37:42] why the bush is not burnt." And when the
[37:46] Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[37:49] God called unto unto him out of the
[37:51] midst of the bush, and said, "Moses,
[37:54] Moses," and he said, "Here am I." And he
[37:57] said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy
[38:02] shoes from off thy feet from for the
[38:05] place where on thou standest is holy
[38:08] ground is holy ground." Moreover, he
[38:11] said, I am the God of thy father, the
[38:13] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
[38:16] the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
[38:18] face, for he was a afraid to look upon
[38:21] God. Amen. God bless the reading of his
[38:24] word. You may be seated.
[38:29] This morning I'd like to speak on a
[38:30] little topic that I entitled the the
[38:32] backside of the desert. The back side of
[38:35] the desert. And I started looking at
[38:38] this topic and realizing that when you
[38:40] go through the scriptures, you realize
[38:43] that almost every
[38:45] man of God that was in the scripture had
[38:47] one of these moments. They had one of
[38:50] these times where God led them to a
[38:53] place where they were all alone. God led
[38:55] them to a place where they had to get by
[38:58] themselves. Whether it was by choice or
[39:00] by God's purpose, Jesus went into the
[39:03] wilderness because it was a choice. But
[39:06] Moses, he had to flee to get into the
[39:08] wilderness. But when he got there,
[39:10] something happened. He had an experience
[39:12] with God that changed the rest of his
[39:14] life. He had an experience with God that
[39:17] he could point to that moment and said,
[39:19] "I know God is real because of this
[39:22] experience that I've had." Just imagine
[39:24] if you were outside and you saw
[39:26] something burning, but it wasn't being
[39:28] burnt. It was on fire. You see the fire,
[39:31] you see the smoke, but nothing is
[39:33] burning. That's what Moses, he
[39:36] encountered when he was in the
[39:37] wilderness. And he had to turn aside
[39:40] because he might have seen a thousand
[39:42] thousands of fires. They said when the
[39:45] desert gets hot enough, things catch on
[39:47] fire. But see, he might have seen
[39:49] thousands. But it was something
[39:51] different about this fire.
[39:53] and said, "It's just like Elijah said.
[39:56] He said, "It's just like fire shut up in
[39:58] my bones." See, when that fire took
[40:00] place, it was something that changed how
[40:03] he looked at that fire cuz he knew it
[40:04] was different. He had seen fire all his
[40:07] life, but this fire was different. This
[40:10] fire had a calling to it. This fire
[40:12] could speak to him, could have a
[40:15] conversation with him. When he came and
[40:17] saw it, he said, "Don't come here
[40:19] because where you're standing is holy
[40:21] ground."
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] See, it it was something about this
[40:25] experience that Moses had. And whenever
[40:28] he got in trouble, he could always point
[40:30] back to this experience that he had. He
[40:33] could always point back and say, "I know
[40:35] God is real because he met me in the
[40:37] burning bush. He met me and he spoke to
[40:40] me. He had a conversation with me and he
[40:42] told me what I was supposed to do." Many
[40:45] of times, how many of us have those
[40:47] backside of the desert experiences in
[40:50] life? Where you come to the moments
[40:52] where you're all alone? You come to the
[40:54] moments where you're by yourself. You
[40:56] come to the moments where you feel like
[40:58] all hope is gone. And then God will show
[41:01] up right on the scene. He'll show up and
[41:03] show you that I'm real. I I've always
[41:06] heard your prayers. I've seen what
[41:08] you've been going through. And I'm
[41:10] coming down to speak to you today. I'm
[41:12] coming down to tell you something so
[41:14] that you can continue to go on. You can
[41:16] continue to fight the battle. You can go
[41:18] back to Egypt with confidence that God
[41:21] is real and that God is going to deliver
[41:23] his people.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; That's why God came in the desert that
[41:26] day cuz it was a time God had heard the
[41:28] cries of his people. He said, "No longer
[41:31] will I let them stay in Egypt. It's time
[41:33] for me to go and deliver them, but I got
[41:35] to go get somebody attention. I got to
[41:38] go down there and show them. I got to go
[41:40] down there to Moses and say, "Hey, the
[41:42] thing that they was telling you that you
[41:44] was prophesied over that you was told to
[41:46] do, it's time for you to go fulfill it.
[41:48] It's time for you to go do your purpose.
[41:51] It's time for you to go do what God
[41:52] wants you to do."
[41:55] &gt;&gt; But you see, he had to come down and he
[41:56] had to do something to show him, hey,
[41:58] this isn't ordinary. This isn't
[42:00] something that you're imagining. This is
[42:02] something that's real.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And and nobody can tell you the
[42:06] experience that you have with God.
[42:08] Because when you have it, it's
[42:09] individualized to you. Nobody knows how
[42:13] to get your attention like God knows how
[42:14] to get your attention. Nobody knows how
[42:17] to speak to you like God knows how to
[42:19] speak to you. And he might use the
[42:21] smallest things. He can use the greatest
[42:23] things, but sometimes he just wants to
[42:26] do something that'll get your attention.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; He just wants to do something that'll
[42:30] show you, hey, it's not I'm not just
[42:33] what everybody else may believe in. I'm
[42:35] the one and only true God.
[42:37] I'm the one and only that created
[42:39] heavens and earth. The one that that's
[42:41] alpha and omega from the beginning of
[42:43] the end. And I saw this. I knew this.
[42:45] And I knew that you would be here. I
[42:47] knew what you would go through and I
[42:49] understood it. That's why I came to the
[42:51] cross and took all of that. I took
[42:54] depression, anxiety, all of this on the
[42:56] cross so that you could so that I can
[42:58] understand what you go through.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; I could understand what it was like to
[43:02] have loss. So I can that's why he let
[43:04] Lazarus die
[43:06] &gt;&gt; so that he could understand grief and
[43:08] sadness and all these things. He let
[43:10] these things happen because he wanted to
[43:12] experience it but also show you that I'm
[43:15] the one that can overcome it all.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that can bring you to that
[43:19] point and bring you over that point. I
[43:22] can take you through it if you allow me
[43:24] to lead you and guide you straight
[43:26] through it.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Glory. But see, you got to have those
[43:30] backside of the desert experiences.
[43:33] You got to have that moment in time that
[43:35] you can point to and said, "I know when
[43:37] at my lowest moment, God was there."
[43:40] &gt;&gt; At my lowest and darkest moment, God was
[43:43] there.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Who knows? Moses might have been like,
[43:46] "Is this the rest of my life? Is this
[43:48] all I'm supposed to do?"
[43:50] &gt;&gt; I always heard I was supposed to deliver
[43:52] them from the Egyptians, but now I'm 80
[43:54] years old.
[43:57] He said, the prophet God said, he said,
[43:59] Moses, God determined cuz he elected him
[44:03] to do so. He wandered in the desert and
[44:05] one day on the back side of the desert,
[44:08] God decided to call his runaway prophet.
[44:11] He selected a certain tree. He said,
[44:13] I've always wondered, I wonder what he
[44:16] put on that tree that it didn't burn up.
[44:19] He said the leaves were popping and
[44:20] cracking the fire in the fire burning.
[44:23] And I don't know how long it burned, but
[44:25] it didn't burn. It was God's selected
[44:27] place to meet his prophet. Said many of
[44:30] times God have moments in your life
[44:32] where he wants to meet you.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; He'll have circumstances, situation in
[44:37] your life that he allow you to go
[44:39] through because it's a moment that he
[44:41] wants to meet you. He wants to speak to
[44:43] you. He wants you to go through it
[44:45] because there's something greater than
[44:46] than you in this moment. God wants to
[44:49] show you for it that he's able to do
[44:52] more than you thought he could do.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; He can bring you out of it. He can
[44:55] deliver you. He can set you free. He can
[44:58] allow you to overcome it.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; He said Moses comes on top of the
[45:02] mountain for those 40 days. He and he,
[45:06] if you go on down in the story, he said
[45:09] in the beginning when Moses when Moses
[45:12] met God in the burning bush, he was
[45:14] afraid to see God. But later on down in
[45:18] Moses' life after God and brought him
[45:20] over the Red Sea and all these many
[45:21] different things, he was in the mountain
[45:23] and he was getting the Ten Commandments
[45:26] and God said, "Do you do you want to see
[45:29] my face?" And Moses was he he wanted to
[45:32] see God. He wanted to see God. And and
[45:35] the prophet God said, "And Moses coming
[45:37] on the top of the mountain for these 40
[45:38] days and he had been up there getting
[45:40] commandments and afterwards knew what it
[45:42] was to meet God, knowing what it was to
[45:45] have a conference of God. So he waited
[45:48] his 40 days. It was easy after he once
[45:51] had a conference with God. See, once you
[45:54] have a meeting with God one time, it's
[45:57] easier to wait on God for the second
[45:59] time because it's easier the third time
[46:02] because you realize that God will always
[46:04] show up on the scene.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; You realize that he won't ever leave you
[46:07] if you have a sincere desire to Lord, I
[46:10] have a need.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I have a need in my life. Lord, I've
[46:16] gotten to this point that I don't want
[46:18] to go forward. I don't want to go back.
[46:20] But Lord, I need you to show up on the
[46:22] scene for me. Lord, I need I you you've
[46:25] done this before. You showed me this.
[46:27] But Lord, I have a need in this moment.
[46:29] Lord, I need to have a conference with
[46:32] you. Lord, I need to have another
[46:34] experience. It's good to have one
[46:36] experience, but you need to have more
[46:37] experiences. You need to continue to let
[46:40] your cup get full and full till your cup
[46:42] run over.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes if you're really really
[46:46] really thirsty, one cup of water ain't
[46:49] good enough.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; One bottle of water ain't good enough.
[46:52] You need something. You want as much
[46:54] much liquid as you can to quench your
[46:56] thirst. But see, sometimes some people
[47:00] they they'll take the little sip and
[47:01] say, "You know what? I'm good."
[47:04] Cuz you know, they might be looking at
[47:05] the next person or this one or that one
[47:07] and say, "No, you know what? I'm good."
[47:10] But you know when you really are
[47:11] thirsty,
[47:13] you you don't necessarily care who was
[47:15] around when you drinking this water. You
[47:17] don't care how ugly it look. You don't
[47:19] care whether it's a few drops spilling
[47:22] cuz you trying to quench your thirst.
[47:24] And see when God comes to you sometimes
[47:26] you got to get to those moments say,
[47:28] "Lord, I'm thirsty."
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm thirsty and I need you to
[47:32] quench my thirst. Lord, I want you to
[47:35] come down and fill that desire that's in
[47:37] my hearts. Lord, I need you to come down
[47:40] and touch me in such a special and a
[47:42] mighty way that I know that you're still
[47:44] here with me.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've had the experience. I've been
[47:48] baptized. I've gotten saved. But Lord, I
[47:50] need more than that.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something that you, as a
[47:54] song said, Lord, keep me day by day. I
[47:57] need the thing that's going to keep me
[47:58] day by day. I need the Holy Ghost inside
[48:01] of me that when that's going to stand up
[48:03] against the ws of the devil when the
[48:05] fiery darts come against me because the
[48:08] devil will never stop fighting.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Whe whether you whether you leave God or
[48:14] not, the devil ain't going to leave you
[48:15] alone.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And I said it I I like to say I said how
[48:20] do how do you know that God loves you? I
[48:23] said when the devil is fighting you and
[48:25] you able to fight back, that means God
[48:27] is still there with you. the fact of the
[48:30] matter that you still have a conscience
[48:32] to know the difference between right and
[48:34] wrong. God is still here. When when you
[48:37] when you start to realize that every day
[48:39] that you wake up is a sign that God
[48:41] loves you. Every day that you able to go
[48:44] out and is a shine that God cares about
[48:46] you. Every accident that he spares you
[48:49] from. Every job that he allows you to
[48:52] keep each and every day. And you realize
[48:54] that God is able to do the things the
[48:57] simple things in life. You start to
[48:59] thank him no more.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Because you started to understand that
[49:04] these are the things that show you how
[49:06] real God is. These are the things that
[49:09] show you how blessed you are. These are
[49:11] the things that show you how how amazing
[49:14] God can be.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; You need those back of the desert
[49:19] experiences, though. You need those
[49:22] moments where you cried out all night
[49:24] like Jacob did and you wrestle with that
[49:27] angel all night and all night and you
[49:29] said, "I'm not going to let go until you
[49:31] bless me." Cuz sometimes God wants to
[49:33] see how determined you are to get what
[49:36] he has for you. He wants to see what are
[49:38] you willing to give up to get what he
[49:40] has for you. Whether it be friends,
[49:42] whether it be family, whether it be
[49:44] money, whether it be houses, whether it
[49:46] be opportunities, whether it be
[49:48] businesses, he wants to know what you're
[49:50] willing to give up for him.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; See, when Moses is is is very paramount
[49:57] when you go and you look at these
[49:59] stories and you realize it was only them
[50:01] and God there.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't them and their family. It
[50:05] wasn't them and their friends. It wasn't
[50:07] them and all these different things. It
[50:09] was them and God. Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; And see, sometimes you got to you got to
[50:13] steal the noise. You got to let all
[50:16] these things be and you got to get alone
[50:18] with God
[50:19] &gt;&gt; until it's just you and him
[50:21] &gt;&gt; and you can talk to God and God can talk
[50:23] to you.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; You can have a conversation with God and
[50:26] God can speak back to you and you can
[50:29] wait there until God does something that
[50:31] that you expecting God to do.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Because it's it's in those moments that
[50:38] can change the rest of your life. Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; See Moses after that moment he could go
[50:42] with confidence even though he told God
[50:45] all these many excuses.
[50:47] How many of us when we talking to God
[50:49] and God tell us to do something we have
[50:51] a lot of excuses.
[50:53] We we we come to God well I can't do
[50:55] that right now. Well God I don't have
[50:58] the money for that right now. Oh God I I
[51:00] don't have the I don't have the
[51:02] fortitude for that right now. Lord I'm
[51:04] not strong enough. Lord I'm I I I can't
[51:07] carry that load right now. I got so many
[51:09] other things that I'm carrying there.
[51:12] There's so many times when when God
[51:14] wants to do something, we have a lot of
[51:16] excuses to God why we can't do it. When
[51:19] God tell us to do something, we have a
[51:21] lot of excuses to God why we can't do
[51:23] it. And Moses came with his litany of
[51:26] excuses. He probably had been building
[51:28] them up. And and he said, "Well, God,
[51:30] you know, you know, I can't I can't I
[51:32] can't talk like that." Well, God said,
[51:34] "I'm going to send Aaron with you." And
[51:36] then God said, "You you don't even have
[51:38] to worry about speaking because it's not
[51:40] you, it's me that's going with you."
[51:43] &gt;&gt; And see, you got to understand when God
[51:46] tells you to do something, it's not
[51:48] because it's something that you are able
[51:50] or capable of doing. It's because he's
[51:52] going to be there right there with you.
[51:54] He's going to take you through it and
[51:55] give you every tool, everything that you
[51:58] need to to be to be able to do what he
[52:01] asked you to do. It doesn't matter what
[52:03] he takes you through. If he got
[52:05] something that he purposed for you to
[52:06] do, he's going to make sure that you got
[52:08] the tools and things to do it. If you
[52:11] look at the story of Joseph, you can see
[52:13] God each and every stop in Joseph's life
[52:16] was building him to one day save Egypt,
[52:19] &gt;&gt; to save his family. Even though you say,
[52:21] "Man, that's a horrible rough life right
[52:24] there." But nobody saw the end of
[52:26] Joseph's story but God. And when you
[52:29] understand that nobody knows the end of
[52:31] your story but God, you you don't have
[52:34] to question what the journey looks like
[52:37] cuz
[52:38] &gt;&gt; because you may never understand the
[52:40] journey that you want.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; You may not understand why you have to
[52:44] go through this and why this happened
[52:45] and why is this because there's some
[52:48] things I said sometimes God will put you
[52:50] in the right place just to save your
[52:52] soul.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; I I I thought about that and I said, you
[52:56] know, you can complain about a lot of
[52:57] things. My family, this, that, and the
[53:00] other. Why I ain't being treated right?
[53:01] All these things. But what if God put
[53:03] you there? Cuz he knew that's what you
[53:05] needed to save your soul.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And I started to think about it. I said,
[53:09] all the things that you might go
[53:10] through, what if God allowed you to go
[53:12] through it just because it was the place
[53:14] that he wanted you to save your soul?
[53:17] &gt;&gt; He said, everything everything is put
[53:20] here for a purpose. Everything has a
[53:22] season. Everything was made because God
[53:25] made it and he made it well when he made
[53:27] it. So there wasn't nothing. He just
[53:30] allowed us. He gave us free will that we
[53:32] can make choices. But at the end of the
[53:34] day, he still knew the choices that you
[53:36] would make. And when he when he allowed
[53:38] you to be here, he still uh through all
[53:40] of that, he chose you.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Even through all your ups and downs, he
[53:46] still chose you. Even through all your
[53:48] good and your bad, he still chose you.
[53:51] Even though even though he knew that
[53:53] you'd make the mistakes that you would,
[53:54] he still decided to choose you. He chose
[53:57] someone that was a murderer.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; That's what he did to Moses.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; But he still said, "You know what? You
[54:04] going to be the one that is going to
[54:05] deliver my people. You think that God
[54:07] didn't know he wasn't going to murder
[54:09] that Egyptian. He knew he would, but he
[54:12] still chose them. So it's not how good
[54:15] you are. It's not how perfect you are.
[54:18] It's not how righteous you live. It's
[54:21] only by the grace and the mercy of God
[54:23] that he chose you. [applause]
[54:27] And he chose his spirit in your life to
[54:30] show you and give you something to
[54:32] anchor you down to prove to you that I
[54:35] chose you. He gives you the Holy Ghost
[54:38] that you can overcome the world. He
[54:40] gives you these things. He gives that
[54:42] fire on the inside that you can overcome
[54:44] the world and prove to you that I chose
[54:46] you. He said that he said that only
[54:49] perfect love is going to enter there.
[54:51] But you can't have it if you don't have
[54:52] the Holy Ghost. You can't have it if you
[54:55] don't have the God inside of you.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Men, whoever had a conference
[55:03] with God or women know what it means to
[55:06] forsake food sometimes, forsake water,
[55:09] forsake the things of the world, forsake
[55:11] everything else to come apart with God
[55:14] to hold a conference."
[55:16] He said, "Moses on this first
[55:17] conference, the burning bush, he
[55:19] received orders from God." He said, "I'm
[55:21] the God of your fathers, and I've heard
[55:23] the cries of my people, and I'm sending
[55:26] you down to deliver them. I want you to
[55:28] go down into Egypt." Look what simple
[55:31] reasons he used. And he said, Moses
[55:33] begins to make excuses, saying, "I'm
[55:35] not. I'm slow of speech and so forth."
[55:38] And he told him that he'd be with him
[55:40] and the angel God would go before him in
[55:42] signs and wonders and that he would do.
[55:45] So he was ready to go. Then see after
[55:47] your experience with God, you're ready
[55:49] to go wherever God sent you.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; See, after Moses experience, he wasn't
[55:54] he wasn't questioning God no more.
[55:57] Because he had had that experience with
[55:59] God in such a way that he was ready to
[56:01] go. He was ready to to be used by God.
[56:04] He was ready. He didn't know how it was
[56:06] going to happen or what was going to
[56:07] happen. He was just going to go because
[56:09] God told him to go. He was going to be
[56:12] led by the spirit and let God lead him
[56:14] because God had sent him. God had come
[56:17] down and vindicated what he wanted him
[56:19] to do in such a way that that he didn't
[56:21] have to worry about it anymore.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] And I thought about another one of the
[56:27] servants and it was I thought about
[56:29] David and and I thought about the story
[56:32] when he when Goliath came as a simple
[56:36] story and when Goliath came there was a
[56:39] lot of people that was more qualified to
[56:41] fight Goliath. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of people that had been
[56:45] trained train trained up to fight
[56:47] Goliath. And
[56:50] and and
[56:53] prophet God said, he said, "Sure, who
[56:55] would tackle that great big giant if
[56:58] there was any man in the whole of
[56:59] Israelite army that should have been
[57:02] physically able would have been Saul."
[57:05] He said Saul was the king and the Bible
[57:07] said that he was head and shoulders
[57:09] above any man in his army.
[57:12] Not only that, he was well-trained man.
[57:14] He knew all the military maneuvers and
[57:17] he had been schooled since a boy of know
[57:19] how to handle a a spear or a sword, but
[57:23] he was afraid because the giant had him
[57:25] bluffed. I wonder how many times we come
[57:28] up on situations that have us bluffed.
[57:32] We run up on a situation that we become
[57:35] afraid of because it's a bluff. Even
[57:38] though it looks bigger than what it is,
[57:41] because we sometimes we we don't
[57:44] necessarily
[57:47] feel confident enough
[57:49] in in in fighting this this thing that
[57:52] we have we're facing. We don't feel the
[57:54] confidence enough to do it.
[57:57] But he goes on and he said, "But you
[57:59] know, God has always got somebody that's
[58:01] not scared. Way back on the back side of
[58:05] the desert hurting his paby sheep was a
[58:07] little old ruddy stoop shoulder boy that
[58:10] knows something about God. He wasn't a
[58:13] trained fighter but when he heard that
[58:15] giant make that expression he said do
[58:18] you mean to tell me that you'll stand
[58:20] here and let that uncircumcised
[58:23] Philistine defy the armies of the living
[58:26] God? He said if you are if you are all
[58:29] scared let me go fight them. He said the
[58:32] most equipped man there was in the
[58:34] entire group. He was the most unequipped
[58:38] man in the entire group. But he had
[58:40] something that was greater than spears
[58:42] and shields. He had something that was
[58:45] greater than swords and spears. He had
[58:48] some he had an experience with God that
[58:51] he knew that you know what this isn't a
[58:54] battle between the Israelites and the
[58:56] Philistines. This is a this is a battle
[58:58] between God and the devil.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] And every time the battle becomes God
[59:04] between God and the devil, God always
[59:06] wins.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And when you start to get out of the
[59:09] view of the feeling this is Goliath and
[59:12] you and you this little small thing and
[59:14] realize this is a fight between God and
[59:16] the devil, you become with a different
[59:18] confidence because you can trust in God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You can depend on God. You can lean on
[59:24] God. You can stand firm on the word of
[59:26] God because you realize that the word of
[59:28] God always defeats the devil. [applause]
[59:32] &gt;&gt; See, once you on, you got to stop
[59:34] looking at the actual thing and see
[59:36] beneath the surface. You got to stop
[59:38] looking at what you see and look and
[59:40] look beyond what you seeing and what's
[59:42] under the surface and realizing that the
[59:45] battle is not yours, but it's the
[59:46] Lord's. See, David knew that he already
[59:49] had victory when he heard what the
[59:51] Philistines said. Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He already had the victory. He hadn't
[59:55] fought him. He hadn't walked that. They
[59:57] hadn't even questioned him yet. He
[59:59] already knew that God had defeated him
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't a battle that he had
[1:00:03] to fight. He knew that God was going to
[1:00:05] prove that he was still the one and only
[1:00:08] true God. He was going to prove that
[1:00:10] there was nothing that can defeat me.
[1:00:12] There's nothing that can stand against
[1:00:14] me. There's nothing that can hold me
[1:00:16] back.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter how well you you're
[1:00:22] trained, if you're not experienced, you
[1:00:25] he said you wouldn't want a doctor to
[1:00:27] operating in you that never had
[1:00:29] experience.
[1:00:30] You was his first patient." Certainly
[1:00:32] not. He said, "We need Christians who
[1:00:35] got experience, who knows how to trust
[1:00:37] God."
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And when David went up, they brought him
[1:00:40] before Saul. And Saul said, "Why you
[1:00:43] couldn't fight that man? why you're
[1:00:45] nothing but a little ruddy kid and
[1:00:47] you're just a youth and he's a warrior
[1:00:49] from his youth. But he said, "But Saul,
[1:00:52] there's there's just one thing you don't
[1:00:54] know. I've had an experience."
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Back on the back side of the
[1:00:59] desert one day, I was brought into a
[1:01:02] showdown. A lion run in and got one of
[1:01:04] my sheep and I knocked him down with a
[1:01:06] slingshot and he rose up against me and
[1:01:09] I killed him."
[1:01:11] He said he he didn't speak with, you
[1:01:13] know, questions in his words. He spoke
[1:01:16] with a definitive tone.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; He spoke with, you know what, these are
[1:01:20] these are things that I know happened.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I un I I I didn't see somebody else tell
[1:01:26] me about it. God showed it to me and it
[1:01:29] happened. These things are something
[1:01:30] that I can point to and I can stand on.
[1:01:33] And he said, "And a bear got a kid and I
[1:01:35] killed him. And the God that delivered
[1:01:38] me out of the paws of the lion and the
[1:01:40] bear will deliver me out of the spear of
[1:01:43] that uncircumcised Philistine. He said,
[1:01:46] "The God that delivered me out of the
[1:01:48] paws of the lion and the bear will
[1:01:50] deliver me out of the spear of that
[1:01:52] uncircumcised Philistine."
[1:01:55] If you ever can look in your life and
[1:01:57] point to a time that God delivered you,
[1:02:00] then you always know that God is a
[1:02:02] deliverer.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he's the same yesterday,
[1:02:05] today, and forever. So if he did it
[1:02:08] before, he'll do it again.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. As
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; the songwriter said, he's the same God
[1:02:12] now as he was then. Amen. He said, and
[1:02:16] he knew what he was talking about. He
[1:02:18] didn't have much training, but he knew
[1:02:20] the God of heaven. And he didn't need
[1:02:22] any training. You don't need it if you
[1:02:25] know God. Said you don't need the
[1:02:28] training if you know God. Some people
[1:02:30] don't understand that why why you're
[1:02:32] able to do the things that you able to
[1:02:35] do or why you seem to go in positions
[1:02:37] that that you wasn't qualified for and
[1:02:40] you're still able to handle yourself
[1:02:42] because you don't need the training if
[1:02:43] you know God. See, God is able to give
[1:02:46] you the things that others may work hard
[1:02:49] for. God is able to bless you with
[1:02:52] things that other may try all their life
[1:02:54] for because you know God.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he conquered the Philistine
[1:02:59] because God was with him. What he had an
[1:03:02] experience. Therefore, he had faith
[1:03:05] because he know what God had done. God
[1:03:08] could do again because he know what God
[1:03:11] had done. God could do again. And the
[1:03:14] crisis was on and God would act. I
[1:03:16] wonder today how many people are in
[1:03:18] crisis?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; How many people are in a crisis or
[1:03:23] facing something? Because he said here,
[1:03:26] the crisis was on and it's not for you
[1:03:28] to act, but it's for him to act. It's
[1:03:30] for him to show up on the scene and
[1:03:32] prove that he is God. It's for him to
[1:03:35] show up and say, "You know what? This
[1:03:36] situation is not about you. It's it's
[1:03:39] all about me coming down and showing you
[1:03:41] that I'm still here."
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, don't you see it? God is
[1:03:46] obligated to act every time. He's got to
[1:03:49] in order to be God. If if you just won't
[1:03:53] doubt him if you just won't doubt him.
[1:03:57] He must act in order to stay God. See,
[1:04:00] we get smarter. The generations makes us
[1:04:03] smarter. We learn the intelligence of
[1:04:05] our father. But God was infinite to
[1:04:08] begin with.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; He don't start getting any smarter. What
[1:04:12] he did the first time, he has to do
[1:04:14] every time because he was perfect to
[1:04:17] begin with. and his actions and his
[1:04:20] motives and his power and all that he
[1:04:22] was was perfect to start with. He don't
[1:04:25] need any schooling.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can go through
[1:04:29] that God hasn't already seen, hasn't
[1:04:31] already faced and hasn't already
[1:04:34] overcome.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; See, when he went to hell and he went
[1:04:37] and died on the cross, that was when he
[1:04:39] went to hell and death and he defeated
[1:04:41] hell and death in the grave. So, there
[1:04:43] was nothing there that could ever defeat
[1:04:45] him. There was nothing there that that
[1:04:48] would make you afraid because God is
[1:04:50] with you. If he said, "I promise to
[1:04:53] never leave you nor forsake you and and
[1:04:55] to and to always be there for you," then
[1:04:58] that's the God that's always there. If
[1:05:01] he was there before, he'll be there
[1:05:02] then. If he was there yesterday, he's
[1:05:05] there today. If he was there the day
[1:05:07] before that, he was there yesterday. If
[1:05:09] he was there the day before that and
[1:05:11] before that, he was there the second day
[1:05:13] ago and the yesterday and today and
[1:05:16] he'll be there tomorrow and he'll be
[1:05:17] there the day after that and he'll
[1:05:20] always be there because there's
[1:05:21] something that you can hold on that God
[1:05:24] is still real. God is still a healer.
[1:05:26] He's still a deliverer. He's still a
[1:05:29] provider. He's still everything that I
[1:05:31] need.
[1:05:33] See, I can point back to my experience
[1:05:35] with God and show forth that God is
[1:05:38] still there with me. And every now and
[1:05:40] again, I got to get back down and be
[1:05:42] reminded of what God has done for me. I
[1:05:45] got to be reminded of what he's brought
[1:05:47] me through. I got to be reminded of my
[1:05:49] backside of the desert experiences and
[1:05:52] point to it and say, "Lord, I still need
[1:05:54] you to show up one more time. Lord, I
[1:05:56] still need you to come down one more
[1:05:58] time. Lord, I need you to come down and
[1:06:00] show me and do the things once again,
[1:06:03] Lord. Lord, I need you to refill me and
[1:06:05] I need you to overflow me once more,
[1:06:07] Lord. Lord, I need you to give me extra
[1:06:10] strength, Lord. I need you to give me
[1:06:11] extra victory, Lord. I need you to give
[1:06:13] me a a greater heart's desire, Lord.
[1:06:16] Give me more of you that I I won't be
[1:06:19] afraid, Lord.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. I said too many people they get
[1:06:24] to this moment when God is trying to
[1:06:26] lead them lead them by themsel to have
[1:06:29] their experience and they want to bring
[1:06:31] other people along.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; And I asked the question I wrote down I
[1:06:35] said why are you afraid to be alone?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Many of times nowadays many people
[1:06:41] struggle with many different things but
[1:06:43] why are you afraid to be alone? Sometime
[1:06:46] God has to get you by yourself. He got
[1:06:49] to get you there so that he can do do
[1:06:51] the work that he's been wanting to do in
[1:06:53] your life. He's been wanting to do
[1:06:55] something that you can have that
[1:06:57] experience that you can hold on to for
[1:06:59] the rest of your life that you can hold
[1:07:01] on to and say, "God, I know you did
[1:07:04] something for me. Lord, I don't I needed
[1:07:07] it and you came on the scene and you did
[1:07:09] it for me." I like something Brother
[1:07:11] Ernest, he always says. He said, he
[1:07:14] said, "Your rock bottom may not be my
[1:07:16] rock bottom, but each one of us will hit
[1:07:18] rock bottom." And when you hit rock
[1:07:20] bottom, you got to realize what you
[1:07:22] standing on.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You got to have something that's greater
[1:07:25] than you to stand on. You got to have
[1:07:27] something that you can point to and
[1:07:29] said, "My faith looks up to thee." Said,
[1:07:32] "My" And see, you got to have something
[1:07:34] that you can point to like the
[1:07:36] songwriter said, "At the cross." At the
[1:07:38] cross where I first saw the light. See,
[1:07:41] that's all that we're trying to get you
[1:07:43] to understand that you got to have those
[1:07:45] experiences where you got to come to God
[1:07:47] and say, "Lord, I want you to take
[1:07:48] everything.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to give you up everything."
[1:07:52] And Lord, I promise you, God will do
[1:07:54] something in your life. I promise you,
[1:07:56] God will show up in your life, God, to
[1:07:58] do something that you can point to and
[1:08:00] say, "Lord, I knew at this time
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; if I ever had any doubt in you,
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; I I don't have no doubt no more. Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; If I had anything that I question, I
[1:08:11] don't have those questions anymore. He's
[1:08:14] a question answering God. He He's a He's
[1:08:17] a God that'll show up on the scene. He's
[1:08:19] a God that'll deliver. He's a God
[1:08:21] that'll save. He's a God that are set
[1:08:24] free.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; My God don't ever stumble or fail to
[1:08:28] show up for me.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; He don't ever stumble or fail. He may
[1:08:32] not be when I want it, but he shows up
[1:08:34] right on time. Sometimes you just got to
[1:08:36] wait a little while. But God is still
[1:08:38] working behind the scenes. He's still
[1:08:41] doing the things that I can't even see.
[1:08:44] See, in those moments, I start to get
[1:08:46] thanking God because as the worse the
[1:08:48] trial gets, the I know that God is
[1:08:51] coming right soon. I know that he's
[1:08:53] right around the corner cuz the devil's
[1:08:55] fighting me harder. I He wouldn't be
[1:08:57] fighting me if it wasn't something that
[1:08:59] God's got for me. he wouldn't be
[1:09:01] fighting me as hard as he is if there
[1:09:03] isn't something that God has for me
[1:09:05] that's right around the corner and he's
[1:09:07] just trying to stop me from breaking
[1:09:09] through because he knows when I break
[1:09:11] through that the devil that I saw today
[1:09:13] I don't have to see no more
[1:09:17] see it's right there and sometimes we
[1:09:19] give up right when right at the edge of
[1:09:21] the breakthrough we give up right there
[1:09:23] but God is trying to tell you no press
[1:09:25] on press on keep fighting keep fighting
[1:09:29] keep fighting That thing that I did
[1:09:31] before, I'm showing you is still around
[1:09:33] right around the corner. I'm showing you
[1:09:35] that experience. It wasn't a one-time
[1:09:37] experience. It was an experience I'm
[1:09:39] going to give you over and over and over
[1:09:40] and over again. See, it's something that
[1:09:42] once you press through, there's
[1:09:44] something greater right around the
[1:09:46] corner.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; See, the devil wants you to believe that
[1:09:49] it's time to give up.
[1:09:52] He wants you to get to the point that
[1:09:53] you know what, I done as good as I can.
[1:09:56] This is good enough for me. But know
[1:09:58] there's something more that God wants to
[1:10:00] give.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's always more. If he said uh he
[1:10:04] owns the cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:10:07] There's always something more that God
[1:10:09] can give. I I told the story many times,
[1:10:13] but I'm reminded of the story. I said
[1:10:15] there was a story of a man. He he had
[1:10:18] went to he eventually ended up passing
[1:10:21] away and he gets to heaven and they take
[1:10:24] him past down this long hallway and they
[1:10:27] passing some rooms and he sees a door
[1:10:29] open.
[1:10:31] Then the room and and he and as he's
[1:10:34] passing the door this they the angel is
[1:10:37] leading him down the hallway and as he
[1:10:39] passing the door he sees this great room
[1:10:42] in one of the doorways and the angel
[1:10:44] reaches and it's full up with many
[1:10:46] different things. wonderful things,
[1:10:48] presents, all this type of stuff in
[1:10:50] there. Everything is shiny and glittery
[1:10:52] and all this type of stuff. And so when
[1:10:54] when he goes to it, the angel comes
[1:10:56] around him and steps around and shuts
[1:10:58] the door quickly.
[1:11:00] And when he shuts the door, he said he
[1:11:02] said, "Why you close the door?"
[1:11:05] And and the man asked asked the angel,
[1:11:07] "Why you close the door?" He said, "You
[1:11:08] don't want to know what was in that
[1:11:10] room." He said, he said, "What do you
[1:11:13] mean I don't want to know?" He said,
[1:11:15] "You don't want to know what was in that
[1:11:16] room." He said, "Let's just keep going."
[1:11:19] And so the man, he get he gets
[1:11:20] inquisitive. He said, "No, I want to
[1:11:22] know. I want to know what was in that
[1:11:25] room." And and and he starts to
[1:11:27] question. And the angel is like, "No,
[1:11:30] no, no. Let's just keep going, trying
[1:11:32] to, you know, trying to push him on
[1:11:33] along." But but you see this man, he he
[1:11:36] was determined to figure it out.
[1:11:38] So eventually he said, "You want to
[1:11:40] know?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "Okay,
[1:11:42] I'll tell you." And then he opens up the
[1:11:45] door and he sees the room and sees all
[1:11:47] these many wonderful things. He walks in
[1:11:49] there and wow wow all these things. And
[1:11:53] the angels he said what are all these
[1:11:55] things? Who do they belong to? Who who
[1:11:58] who were these things given to? He said
[1:12:03] and the angel said these were all the
[1:12:05] things God wanted to give you while you
[1:12:08] were on earth but you was never in the
[1:12:10] place to receive them.
[1:12:13] And many of times that's how God is. He
[1:12:15] He wants to give us more. He wants to
[1:12:17] give us more. He wants to give us more
[1:12:19] of his his anointing, more of his
[1:12:21] presence, more of these things, all
[1:12:23] these spiritual and wonderful gifts. And
[1:12:26] many of times we're not in the place to
[1:12:27] receive them.
[1:12:29] But you got to come down to the place of
[1:12:32] Lord, I get I've gotten to the place of
[1:12:34] Lord, whatever you have for me, I want
[1:12:36] to receive it. Whatever it takes for me
[1:12:39] to get there, Lord, I want to get there
[1:12:41] that I can receive what you have for me.
[1:12:44] I want to receive all the many spiritual
[1:12:46] and blessed gifts that you have for me.
[1:12:49] Everything that you promised me in your
[1:12:51] word, Lord, I want to receive it.
[1:12:53] Everything that you spoken about me, I
[1:12:55] want to receive it. I don't want nothing
[1:12:58] to lack cuz I know that you guys even
[1:13:00] greater for me over there. But while I'm
[1:13:02] here, I want to get everything that God
[1:13:05] has for me. I want to receive all these
[1:13:08] things because God, he has these things
[1:13:10] for me. So why shouldn't I take
[1:13:12] advantage of it? Why shouldn't I receive
[1:13:15] it? Because God has allowed me and given
[1:13:17] me these things.
[1:13:20] See, God has a way of showing up every
[1:13:23] time that you need them. And and even
[1:13:26] when some he has to do the things like
[1:13:29] he did from Moses to get your attention,
[1:13:32] he takes us all through these
[1:13:34] experiences. sometimes just to get your
[1:13:37] attention, to get your attention, to
[1:13:39] draw you away from the path that you was
[1:13:42] going. Moses might have been content to
[1:13:44] live his life in that desert. But God
[1:13:47] had a reason and a purpose for him that
[1:13:50] was greater than hurt and she cheek that
[1:13:53] was greater than what he was doing. And
[1:13:55] he had to do something to get his
[1:13:56] attention.
[1:13:58] See, and in that God getting his
[1:14:00] attention, Moses had an experience with
[1:14:03] God that he could testify of for the
[1:14:06] rest of his life. That he could testify
[1:14:08] of. David had that experience with God
[1:14:11] that he could testify of for the rest of
[1:14:13] his life. And it was a it was a
[1:14:15] foundation that he could stand on and
[1:14:18] said that I know that the God that
[1:14:20] brought me from the lion and the bear is
[1:14:22] the God that can deliver me from the
[1:14:24] Philistine. And Jesus when he when he
[1:14:27] got done in his moment, he got tested by
[1:14:29] the devil, but it was a proof to show us
[1:14:32] that the only way to defeat the devil
[1:14:34] was the word of God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; And see, understanding that these
[1:14:38] experiences was something to show us
[1:14:41] that when when when you get to those
[1:14:43] moments in those places, God will show
[1:14:45] up on the scene.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; God will be right there with you. And
[1:14:49] God, if you cry out to him, he'll show
[1:14:51] up for you because he's the one. He's
[1:14:54] the author of our faith. And he's the
[1:14:56] beginning from the end. And he knew the
[1:14:58] end of the story. And he wouldn't allow
[1:15:00] you to get there without having a way to
[1:15:02] bring you through it.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; See, that's God and what he does for
[1:15:08] each and every one of us.
[1:15:12] He wants you to get there so that
[1:15:14] sometimes you can get the victory over
[1:15:16] what you're facing. But he can only get
[1:15:18] you. He can only do it when you get to
[1:15:21] that place. When you get to that moment
[1:15:23] and you get to that time which you're
[1:15:25] realizing that you want to give up and
[1:15:27] surrender all. Amen. Let us bow
[1:15:33] and let the musicians come.
[1:15:39] Lord, we heard your word this morning.
[1:15:42] Lord, we want to point to those
[1:15:45] experiences that we have with you. Lord,
[1:15:48] we understand that sometimes it takes us
[1:15:51] getting by ourselves, getting desperate,
[1:15:54] getting the alone with you, Lord, to
[1:15:57] hear you, to see you move in our lives.
[1:15:59] Lord, we we don't want to leave this
[1:16:02] place without you doing something for
[1:16:04] us.
[1:16:06] Lord, you said when two or three are
[1:16:07] gathered in your name, you you be in the
[1:16:09] midst. So, Lord, we know that you're
[1:16:11] here this morning. Lord, we know that
[1:16:13] you're right here with us. And Lord, we
[1:16:15] asking that you just touch some heart,
[1:16:17] touch some life. If there's anyone here
[1:16:20] that may say that, I don't know the
[1:16:23] Lord. I've never had that experience
[1:16:25] with him. I've never asked him to
[1:16:28] forgive me of my sins.
[1:16:31] And you want to give your life to the
[1:16:32] Lord today. While every head is bowed
[1:16:35] and every eyes are closed, I ask you
[1:16:37] just lift your hand.
[1:16:40] Thank you. Thank you.
[1:16:45] Lord Jesus, we thank you for the hands
[1:16:47] that are lifted and the hearts that are
[1:16:50] open. Lord, we ask that you touch them
[1:16:53] and Lord, continue to work in their
[1:16:55] lives and Lord, continue to show forth
[1:16:58] that this day may be a moment in their
[1:17:01] experience with you that they can point
[1:17:03] back to you and say, "Lord,
[1:17:06] something changed. Something happened.
[1:17:09] Lord, something something is different.
[1:17:13] And Lord, I let them allow them to
[1:17:15] continue to grow in you and grow closer
[1:17:18] to you each and every day. There's
[1:17:20] someone else that say, you know, I I
[1:17:24] I've been saved, but you know, I want to
[1:17:26] take the next step. I want to be
[1:17:28] baptized in Jesus' name. And you haven't
[1:17:31] done that at this time.
[1:17:33] Would you lift your while every head is
[1:17:35] bowed and every eyes closed? Would you
[1:17:37] lift your hands?
[1:17:42] Amen. God bless you.
[1:17:44] Lord, you see the hands that are lifting
[1:17:46] the hearts that are open. Lord, we ask
[1:17:49] that you continue to lead in God and
[1:17:52] walk with them. And Lord, continue to
[1:17:54] touch them in a mighty and a special way
[1:17:56] and continue to work in their lives. And
[1:17:59] Lord, we ask we thank you for your
[1:18:02] anointing today. We thank you for your
[1:18:03] presence. We thank you for allowing us
[1:18:05] to come into your house, Lord. We ask
[1:18:08] that you just move
[1:18:10] in a mighty and a special way and over
[1:18:13] the rest of the [music] service. In
[1:18:15] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
