[37:27] it's just good to be in the house of the
[37:29] lord amen
[37:31] praise god so much is happening so fast
[37:34] and the world look like it's rapidly
[37:36] the sixth vision and the seventh vision
[37:38] that the prophet saw boom we're right
[37:40] here could be through
[37:42] the third wall and the third world war
[37:45] and all breaks out and
[37:47] where are we california's sinking japan
[37:49] just had a seven point everything is
[37:51] just shaking all over
[37:53] yet the people seemed
[37:55] like they're still asleep
[37:57] we gotta wake up brother sister
[38:04] 14 and 12
[38:07] it says
[38:09] see
[38:11] how are thou falling from heaven o
[38:13] lucifer
[38:15] son of the morning
[38:16] how the cut down to the ground
[38:19] which did weaken the nation
[38:22] 13.
[38:36] and i will ascend above the height of
[38:38] the cloud
[38:40] and i will be like the most high fifteen
[38:47] together
[38:49] they that see thee should narrowly look
[38:51] upon thee and considerably saying
[38:55] is this the man that made the earth to
[38:58] tremble and that did shake kingdoms and
[39:01] god bless you read the word you may be
[39:02] seated
[39:06] as i was in prayer
[39:08] yesterday
[39:11] praying that god would just give us
[39:12] something for the people of god
[39:15] and not only did he give us something
[39:17] for you all but he gave us something for
[39:19] me
[39:20] amen
[39:21] so he said the husband must be first
[39:24] partaker of the fruit amen
[39:27] and
[39:28] the prophet god spoke a message on
[39:30] humble
[39:32] yourselves
[39:34] we want to talk this morning and
[39:38] it really made me re-examine myself
[39:42] humble yourself
[39:44] and i want you to look at the spirit of
[39:46] this age
[39:47] the last stage of spirit of the last
[39:49] days
[39:50] you know i i would consider the spirit
[39:52] of the last days to be
[39:54] the sub-topic this morning in the spirit
[39:56] of the last days
[39:58] and as we look at the spirit of the last
[40:00] days and looking at lucifer
[40:02] uh
[40:03] how he reacted and
[40:05] and what was he what was he all about
[40:08] i believe the characteristics
[40:10] of lucifer
[40:12] would describe the characteristics of
[40:13] the spirit of the last days
[40:16] are you with me
[40:18] and people
[40:19] subconsciously uh just don't care
[40:23] whether the spirit of lucifer
[40:26] as i told about the young man that was
[40:28] calling on lucifer
[40:30] forming that the mouth had lost it all
[40:32] and god healed them and delivered him
[40:35] from the spirit of lucifer
[40:37] lucifer is just as real as jesus christ
[40:40] and that young man was delivered and
[40:43] it was a sight to see because people saw
[40:47] somebody that was so demon possessed
[40:49] that they were calling on lucifer in the
[40:52] midst of the church
[40:54] are you with me
[40:56] but god
[40:57] is faithful
[40:59] amen
[41:00] but because we think that lucifer don't
[41:03] exist
[41:05] and the very
[41:06] individuals that
[41:08] think that
[41:09] lucifer don't exist may
[41:11] be possessed with the spirit of lucifer
[41:14] and not even know it
[41:18] you know the prophet of god said
[41:20] you know
[41:22] spirit of a lust spirit different
[41:24] spirits that he cast out of
[41:26] uh mary magdalene had seven demons
[41:29] are you with me
[41:31] and so some sometimes if people are
[41:33] carrying spirits that they are not
[41:35] conscious of
[41:38] amen and you're taking baggage that you
[41:41] don't even know so
[41:43] it behooves us to examine ourselves and
[41:46] look at ourselves
[41:49] and and and um just before i came up
[41:53] i wrote something down that's room for
[41:55] improvement
[41:57] i'm talking about for me
[42:01] that i can be more humble
[42:05] i mean sometimes we think that you know
[42:07] we reach the pinnacle
[42:10] and that we have it
[42:12] but god sometimes he's he just nudging
[42:15] said hey
[42:18] you can't be
[42:20] more humble
[42:23] see sometimes we don't know what kind of
[42:26] spirit sometimes
[42:28] we're carrying and sometimes our
[42:30] attitude
[42:32] is not where it needs to be
[42:35] and
[42:36] oftentimes those flaws in our lives
[42:39] those faults
[42:40] god want to correct but we got to be
[42:42] knowledgeable amen that we need
[42:45] correction
[42:47] in our spirit
[42:48] so as we examine lucifer he said how's
[42:51] that falling and you know
[42:54] i was in prayer and i was
[42:57] i i i wish i had my pen there but as i
[43:00] was in prayer this morning for full
[43:01] service and not on my knees and usually
[43:04] i have my
[43:05] my pen there so because god started
[43:07] talking i started writing
[43:09] i tried to get up and try to write some
[43:12] of the stuff things down
[43:15] and um
[43:18] probably left it back there what i wrote
[43:21] down but anyway it was dealing with
[43:24] um
[43:26] i will
[43:27] and god's will
[43:29] you know what i'm saying
[43:31] lucifer talk about what i would do
[43:34] and most of us got that spirit i will
[43:36] you know subconsciously you got a spirit
[43:39] that
[43:40] yes you you know i will i'm going to do
[43:43] this
[43:44] i'm going to do that and i will
[43:46] and
[43:48] we we almost don't even put god
[43:51] in the plan as though he don't exist
[43:55] it's almost like
[43:57] lucifer said i'm going to exalt my
[43:58] throne
[44:00] and see in our
[44:02] minds we're going to exalt ourselves
[44:06] lucifer had the self-image that he's
[44:09] going to exalt himself
[44:11] and so often times we're worried about
[44:15] exalting self
[44:17] how can i
[44:18] exalt myself
[44:21] and that's what god wants to get rid of
[44:24] our pride
[44:26] and wants us to be conscious of
[44:27] self-exaltation
[44:30] exalting ourselves
[44:34] that we can lift ourselves up
[44:37] above the stars
[44:40] you know god had seven stars in his hand
[44:43] are you with me
[44:45] and that was the seven messages to the
[44:47] seven church ages
[44:49] but we can exalt
[44:50] our throne above the stars of god
[44:54] are you with me
[44:55] oftentimes we exalt ourselves
[44:59] subconsciously and not really knowing
[45:01] what we're doing but because the spirit
[45:03] of pride is gonna on us
[45:06] because we have a spirit of pride
[45:08] then we exalt ourselves
[45:11] i'm not used to teaching i'm used to
[45:13] preaching on sunday morning but
[45:15] y'all bear with me
[45:17] are you with me
[45:18] let let me go to the spirit of the uh
[45:21] last days
[45:22] and see the spirit of lucifer and see
[45:25] whether it parallel
[45:26] with the spirit that anoints
[45:29] uh folks in the last days it would be
[45:31] the same spirit that had known that
[45:33] lucifer when he was in heaven
[45:35] the spirit of this age
[45:38] are you with me
[45:40] so
[45:41] in second timothy 3
[45:44] and 1
[45:46] he said let's know also
[45:49] that in the last days
[45:52] dangerous or perilous times should come
[45:55] and i tell you anything could be any
[45:56] dangerous is
[45:58] than these earthquakes and
[46:01] you know even ryan colombia and ron
[46:02] elgin
[46:03] it hadn't stopped
[46:05] earthquakes all the time
[46:09] japan and all of that
[46:12] and the threat of the third world war
[46:15] nuclear war
[46:17] nobody wants it
[46:19] nobody wants nuclear war
[46:22] the whole world don't want it but
[46:26] we're right there at
[46:28] you know and i said lord you
[46:30] held back the four winds and
[46:33] and you said to the servants of god
[46:35] sealed in the forehead
[46:37] and i said god you know he's holding
[46:39] back
[46:41] the third world
[46:42] in the nuclear war
[46:44] but
[46:45] and to the servants of god
[46:48] to god conceal somebody
[46:51] amen to somebody can get all the way in
[46:53] and all the way right like they should
[46:57] god is holding back the four winds
[47:01] are you with me
[47:02] and i'm glad that god held it back for
[47:04] me
[47:06] and if you're not right with god
[47:09] you ought to know god's mercy it's with
[47:11] you
[47:12] and he's given you opportunity to be
[47:14] sealed
[47:16] but it's up to you if you want to be
[47:18] sealed or not
[47:19] but you know that god's elect
[47:22] amen
[47:23] they want it
[47:27] now
[47:30] see
[47:32] we don't want to deal with
[47:35] ourselves sometimes
[47:37] oftentimes we don't want to deal with
[47:40] ourselves he said
[47:42] dangerous or prayerless time should come
[47:43] for men shall be what
[47:47] it's all about what we want
[47:51] we love ourselves it's what we want
[47:56] it's all about what i want
[47:59] i want this i want that and i'm going to
[48:00] beat this up it's all about your god in
[48:03] it you know
[48:04] it doesn't make no difference with god
[48:07] you know
[48:09] i want this i want that and just you
[48:11] know just ignore the god don't even
[48:13] exist and like they don't think the
[48:15] lucifer exists either they don't think
[48:17] the devil exists and they don't think
[48:18] god exists and what are you thinking or
[48:21] not there's a right and there's a room
[48:25] are you with me
[48:27] if there was no right or wrong
[48:30] then i can understand
[48:32] that's good and that's evil
[48:34] whether you want to face it or not
[48:37] it exists
[48:40] are you with me
[48:42] this day and there's night
[48:44] are you with me
[48:46] and nothing you can do about it
[48:48] amen
[48:50] but amen
[48:52] as you
[48:54] look at your life you know are you
[48:57] children of the day or your children of
[48:58] the night
[49:00] of your children of the night then you
[49:02] are going to do like the creatures that
[49:04] come out in the night
[49:07] after i'll try to operate
[49:09] in the daytime and the blinding
[49:12] because he's a night creature
[49:14] are you with me
[49:16] and so if you are
[49:19] the night
[49:21] then you don't want delight
[49:25] are you with me
[49:27] because the light is for the children of
[49:29] the thing
[49:31] are you with me
[49:32] but the children of the night they hate
[49:34] the light
[49:36] are you with me
[49:38] because it's blinds and brother fred
[49:40] so they don't like the light
[49:42] because their children are tonight
[49:47] oh lord
[49:49] ain't god good
[49:50] that shall be light in the evening time
[49:52] that's why god sent light for us
[49:55] for you and i isn't that right
[49:57] that we might see how to operate in such
[50:00] a
[50:00] gross dark age
[50:03] amen
[50:05] but god opened up the seals and opened
[50:07] the word that we can see in this dark
[50:09] day
[50:11] are you a man
[50:15] so
[50:16] here we are he says
[50:20] for men should be lovers of their own
[50:22] cells
[50:24] that's our problem that's that's how
[50:26] we're hung up on self
[50:31] we're so
[50:32] in tune to ourselves
[50:37] i've seen mothers
[50:43] this isn't happening lately
[50:45] i don't know what's going on with the
[50:46] system but
[50:48] it's been
[50:50] harming
[50:51] but uh by the grace of god we're so in
[50:53] tune to self can y'all hear me all right
[50:56] we're so into in the self and um
[50:59] because of uh uh uh uh of self
[51:02] i see mothers pursue
[51:04] because they want the pledges of sin and
[51:07] they let the children
[51:09] oh
[51:11] they'll walk away from home and they'll
[51:13] leave their children
[51:17] i've seen the fathers
[51:20] not want to provide for the children
[51:25] so it's a dreadful day that we live in
[51:28] because people want to go after their
[51:30] own dreams
[51:33] the imagination of their own hearts
[51:37] they want to do their thing
[51:41] so they're for some they forsake the
[51:43] thing
[51:44] that they're supposed to be doing
[51:48] oh god people don't okay say he says
[51:52] lovers of their own self covers this
[51:55] everything is dealing with
[51:57] lucifer
[51:58] coverages
[52:00] okay
[52:02] bolsters
[52:05] people
[52:06] brag so much
[52:08] bolsters proud
[52:11] blasphemers they don't mind blaspheming
[52:14] they're jesus or
[52:15] god and i don't believe in god i don't
[52:18] believe it no
[52:19] no bible i don't believe in nothing i
[52:21] believe in myself
[52:25] young people are gone
[52:28] they are very rude and very arrogant
[52:33] like they think there's something when
[52:34] they're nothing
[52:37] maybe i get ahead of myself
[52:39] uh
[52:41] where caleb is
[52:42] okay
[52:45] josh get me psalms 100
[52:47] and 5.
[52:49] psalms 105.
[52:53] praise god see
[52:56] oftentimes we're so arrogant
[53:00] and so
[53:04] a lot of times we we leave off the
[53:06] things of god
[53:07] because
[53:11] just pick up the third verse the third
[53:13] verse
[53:14] josh get it
[53:17] you got it
[53:20] you're gonna give it to caleb
[53:22] i don't know maybe that i said maybe
[53:24] that's what
[53:25] was neat the third verse i mean third
[53:28] verse go ahead on cop to kill him
[53:30] 103. you got it up there oh no
[53:34] okay go ahead
[53:40] we all right everybody all right i'm
[53:43] going too slow
[53:45] okay
[53:46] so by the grace of god i want you to see
[53:48] some things
[53:49] i want you to see what god was speaking
[53:51] to me
[53:52] and i began to look at
[53:54] my walk with god everything is real
[53:58] my walk with god and i began to reassess
[54:02] my walk with god
[54:06] and i asked god for help
[54:11] because i want to be
[54:14] more humble
[54:16] so i asked god to help me
[54:20] help me
[54:22] bring
[54:23] self under subjection
[54:26] to your word
[54:28] help me to
[54:30] humble myself
[54:34] but i cannot do it except i
[54:36] know that i need
[54:38] more humility
[54:41] except i understand i need more humility
[54:45] because sometimes we walk as though
[54:47] we've already attained
[54:50] or we already have it
[54:53] when god says you need more grace
[54:57] are you with me
[54:59] go ahead on killer
[55:02] psalms 103
[55:04] know ye that the lord he is god
[55:07] it is he that has made us and not we
[55:09] ourselves we don't want to hear that
[55:12] we don't want to hear that
[55:14] we think that we're here because
[55:16] i don't know
[55:18] i don't know where they ever thought it
[55:20] in their mind they think that i exist
[55:22] because of my existence
[55:25] they're not there's no respect for
[55:27] parents
[55:32] are you with me
[55:34] because they don't want you know
[55:37] when they couldn't take care of
[55:38] themselves when they were babies and you
[55:40] had to feed them you had to do
[55:42] everything for them they got no respect
[55:45] they're not grateful they're not
[55:47] thankful for nothing
[55:52] are you with me
[55:55] you give them giving them a little money
[55:57] and a little education and they think
[55:59] they something
[56:05] and sometimes they think that you have
[56:06] to do what you do for them
[56:12] they're stuffing their rebellious
[56:16] the young people today
[56:18] see their place in a in a world where
[56:20] they're being anointed with the spirit
[56:22] that lucifer had
[56:25] and because of their being
[56:28] with the lucifer
[56:30] tight spirit
[56:32] that anoints this age that we live in
[56:35] the last day spirit
[56:37] will be a such
[56:40] a proud and boastful spirit go ahead
[56:43] it says here
[56:45] blasphemers disobedient to what
[56:49] on what
[56:52] oh excuse me go go no go on over there
[56:54] know you that that the lord hears god go
[56:57] i'm i'm i'm over there back and feed
[56:59] them i mean uh timothy but go ahead on
[57:02] going on
[57:04] we are his people in the sheep of his
[57:06] pastor go ahead enter this gates with
[57:09] thanksgiving
[57:10] that's why he says you ought to praise
[57:11] him because you know
[57:13] he made you
[57:15] and that's why you ought to praise him
[57:19] are you open
[57:20] that's why you ought to be thankful
[57:24] the attitude you ought to be giving god
[57:26] thanks
[57:27] do you think so
[57:30] folks come to church today thankful that
[57:32] god give him another day to live
[57:36] another opportunity to praise him
[57:39] folks don't even want to go to church no
[57:42] more
[57:43] because they think that i can go on and
[57:46] i can live my life and as dole amen i
[57:49] woke myself up this morning
[57:55] they don't want to acknowledge god at
[57:56] all
[57:58] but you see what i'm saying is something
[58:00] that blocks the hearing
[58:03] he said he that has an ear to hear let
[58:05] him
[58:06] what what the spirit has to say to the
[58:09] what
[58:10] church just lay out the ca but if you
[58:13] don't have an ear you don't have the
[58:14] holy ghost you don't have the spirit of
[58:16] god you actually cannot hear you can sit
[58:20] here this morning and everything your
[58:23] ears are dull of understanding

[58:30] you listen but you can't hear
[58:33] in other words amen you cannot even see
[58:36] you cannot understand the kingdom of god
[58:39] because there's something in you that
[58:41] don't want it
[58:43] it's something in you that i don't want
[58:45] god i don't need god and i don't want
[58:48] him
[58:50] but there's a deep call into the deep
[58:52] there's something that's hungry and
[58:54] thirsting for god and that is the soul
[58:57] that needs god and wants god but you
[58:59] don't want
[59:00] the soul to have it because of your own
[59:04] selfishness
[59:07] are you with me
[59:08] because you're so in tune with self that
[59:11] you don't want to get in tune with god
[59:16] for there's a thirst in every man
[59:18] there's a thirst for god
[59:21] but we don't want to give god what
[59:26] what the soul is hungering and thirsting
[59:28] for we don't want to give it
[59:31] yes we give it some a joint
[59:34] some alcohol
[59:35] some fornication adultery and all of
[59:37] that stuff but we don't want to give it
[59:40] god
[59:42] the soul wants god
[59:44] the living god

[59:50] living god

[59:56] spoke that message thirst amen
[1:00:00] and
[1:00:01] and that's a thirst for god
[1:00:05] it's a thirst
[1:00:07] but you got to answer the call of god
[1:00:09] for your life
[1:00:12] you got to know that god wants to bless
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:19] but the devil will block you
[1:00:22] he'll do everything he can do to block
[1:00:25] the blessings
[1:00:27] to not let god but lessons be restored
[1:00:31] upon your life
[1:00:33] the devil will do everything to hinder
[1:00:35] that from happening
[1:00:38] lucifer job is okay we'll get to that go
[1:00:42] ahead on reading now i got to i got to
[1:00:44] go back here and i got to move faster
[1:00:46] because i'm way behind

[1:05:56] say you look holy you're sanctified that
[1:05:59] god bless you brother
[1:06:01] come on in
[1:06:03] as i said in north carolina the other
[1:06:05] day i said you know
[1:06:07] he says
[1:06:10] i consider you to buy me gold tried in
[1:06:12] the fire
[1:06:13] and white ramen that you might be closed
[1:06:16] and that the shame of your necklace does
[1:06:18] not appear
[1:06:20] are you hoofing
[1:06:21] i want you to put on some
[1:06:23] are you
[1:06:24] but people can stand before god in the
[1:06:26] shame of their nakedness
[1:06:28] and god this is what i present to you
[1:06:32] this is what i'm giving you god
[1:06:35] how are you going to stand before god in
[1:06:38] in the shape that you're in and dress
[1:06:39] like because of pride cain would not
[1:06:42] repent
[1:06:43] though god gave him opportunity to
[1:06:45] repent he refused to repent
[1:06:48] neither would this generation repent
[1:06:52] this generation is rebellious they're so
[1:06:54] into self they said it god
[1:06:58] i don't want to say what i i hear in my
[1:07:02] ears
[1:07:03] and i don't know
[1:07:04] who's saying that
[1:07:08] but it don't sound good to my ears
[1:07:12] what this generation is saying
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:16] that they don't mind going to hell
[1:07:20] and so they're ascending in a
[1:07:22] such
[1:07:24] a dangerous way
[1:07:26] they're saying to god
[1:07:28] the way with you
[1:07:31] i'm hearing them saying
[1:07:34] in my ears i heard it hollered out
[1:07:38] as for god
[1:07:40] oh lord and i feel sorry for the soul
[1:07:42] that i heard said that
[1:07:47] because you're going to need that god
[1:07:49] that you rejected
[1:07:52] amen they said it in a way
[1:07:55] that they were cursing god
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] the bible said they would do it they
[1:08:02] said to the rocks in my
[1:08:04] they cursed god
[1:08:06] when god judged me because they started
[1:08:08] falling on them
[1:08:11] they'll start cursing god instead of
[1:08:13] repenting
[1:08:15] and that's what's going on people are
[1:08:17] cursing god instead of repenting
[1:08:24] the bible says in the fourth verse
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:28] traitors
[1:08:30] heady
[1:08:33] got the big head
[1:08:35] hard here
[1:08:37] big head
[1:08:39] heady
[1:08:41] what
[1:08:44] y'all ever seen anybody like that
[1:08:47] look at somebody asking you ever seen
[1:08:49] anybody like that
[1:08:52] i guess you ain't got to look for
[1:08:56] are you with me
[1:08:58] heady high minded
[1:09:02] what
[1:09:07] y'all don't think god can give you
[1:09:11] what you need and you can have joy and
[1:09:14] happiness
[1:09:16] serving god
[1:09:19] but you know the devil has told you that
[1:09:21] i got more to offer you
[1:09:26] love was a pleasure more than lovers of
[1:09:27] god
[1:09:29] lord have mercy
[1:09:32] this what
[1:09:34] he says heaven and what
[1:09:38] having a form of god is folklore the
[1:09:39] church and got a form of godliness
[1:09:42] but then what
[1:09:45] y'all said they deny the power
[1:09:48] amen they don't want the holy ghost in
[1:09:50] the church
[1:09:51] they don't want signs and oneness they
[1:09:53] don't want miracles they don't want the
[1:09:55] gifts of the spirit operating they don't
[1:09:57] want to see god
[1:09:59] they don't want the power of god they
[1:10:01] deny the power thereof
[1:10:03] amen it's all right
[1:10:04] if the prophet did it back in the day
[1:10:06] but what about now
[1:10:08] what about you and i
[1:10:10] are you with me
[1:10:11] do you want god to operate in your
[1:10:14] life oh god
[1:10:18] lord have mercy
[1:10:20] isaiah
[1:10:22] 3 and 16.
[1:10:26] isaiah 3 16. you got to kill
[1:10:36] go ahead
[1:10:38] oh
[1:10:41] moreover
[1:10:43] the lord said because the daughters of
[1:10:45] zion are what
[1:10:47] hearty
[1:10:51] are y'all understanding what i'm saying
[1:10:53] because the daughters of zion are hearty
[1:10:55] what read them
[1:10:57] and walk with stretch forth and necks
[1:10:59] and wanting eyes
[1:11:01] walking and mincing as they go that's
[1:11:03] the big highest shoes they walk you got
[1:11:06] to make a noise
[1:11:08] with the highest shoes
[1:11:11] mixing
[1:11:13] as it go
[1:11:15] you got to walk a certain way you got to
[1:11:17] move a certain way when you got to hide
[1:11:20] his shoes on
[1:11:23] it make you walk a certain way
[1:11:26] that's why you got to watch
[1:11:29] how high you got those shoes and they
[1:11:31] make you and the men know
[1:11:33] you want folks to watch and see
[1:11:36] oh you're with me that's what it's all
[1:11:37] about
[1:11:39] are you with me
[1:11:40] go ahead they're making a tinkling with
[1:11:43] their feet oh yeah don't come you know
[1:11:44] here
[1:11:46] okay
[1:11:48] so nobody told you oh yeah somebody told
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:52] be careful sister brother
[1:11:54] the prophet god said it's calling that
[1:11:56] vision i mean that dream his mama had
[1:12:00] and they said i'll show you i'm gonna
[1:12:02] walk the highway
[1:12:03] the straight narrow highway with these
[1:12:05] shoes on
[1:12:06] and said the lady fell in hell
[1:12:10] she couldn't walk up that
[1:12:13] straight narrow way
[1:12:15] are you with me
[1:12:16] so i'm gonna i'm gonna say brother and
[1:12:18] sister you're gonna have to
[1:12:20] line up with the word
[1:12:23] but because
[1:12:24] we would not humble ourselves
[1:12:27] we don't care
[1:12:29] i don't see nothing wrong with it
[1:12:31] i do what i want
[1:12:34] oh what is that
[1:12:37] i feel this is what i want to do
[1:12:41] but jesus said not what
[1:12:44] my will it's the will of god
[1:12:47] and
[1:12:48] but lucifer i will exalt my throne
[1:12:52] yes i'm going to lift myself up
[1:12:55] are you with me
[1:12:57] so we're so into it that we don't know
[1:13:00] that we're actually fighting against the
[1:13:02] word and we're coming against god in our
[1:13:05] action and our attitude
[1:13:08] are you up there
[1:13:10] go ahead
[1:13:13] therefore the lord will smite with the
[1:13:15] scab the crown of the head of the
[1:13:17] daughters of zion and the lord will
[1:13:19] discover their secret partners
[1:13:22] in that day the lord will take away the
[1:13:24] bravery of their tinkling ornaments
[1:13:26] about their feet
[1:13:28] and their cold way they want to put
[1:13:30] stuff going
[1:13:31] and they're round tires like the moon
[1:13:35] the chains and the bracelets and the
[1:13:36] mufflers the bonnets
[1:13:39] and the ornaments of the leg and the
[1:13:41] head pins and the tablets and the
[1:13:43] earrings the rings and those jewelry
[1:13:46] jewels that's why you know when god
[1:13:49] takes stuff away people want to do it
[1:13:51] because god said i'm going to take it
[1:13:53] away
[1:13:54] so people do it just to be rebellious
[1:13:56] against god
[1:13:58] i'ma do and show you god
[1:14:01] you told me what the women should have
[1:14:03] dawned themselves and
[1:14:06] in modest parents with shame faces and
[1:14:08] sobriety and not with broader hair gold
[1:14:11] pearl or costly ray
[1:14:15] well you told us how to conduct our
[1:14:17] lives but
[1:14:18] you know you know i'm gonna do what i i
[1:14:22] feel like
[1:14:24] men you know men too you know
[1:14:27] we want to do what we look at god said a
[1:14:30] woman hair
[1:14:31] she had long hair is full of glory isn't
[1:14:34] that right
[1:14:36] but it's a shame for a man to have long
[1:14:38] hair you know what happens we reverse it
[1:14:40] we let the man have the long hair and
[1:14:42] the women cut off like yeah
[1:14:45] are you with me because why we're
[1:14:47] rebelling against god the spirit of the
[1:14:49] last day is to rebel against god
[1:14:53] so the men has long
[1:14:55] and the women have shot cut it off
[1:14:58] the woman want to look like the man and
[1:15:00] the man want to look like what's the
[1:15:01] woman it's the rebellion against the
[1:15:03] scripture so i'm gonna show god
[1:15:06] and that's what the spirit of it's the
[1:15:08] anointing of lucifer
[1:15:10] on the people the spirit of lucifer on
[1:15:14] the people that have a proud and a
[1:15:16] lifted up spirit that they're going to
[1:15:18] lift themselves up above the word
[1:15:24] god
[1:15:25] i'll tell you
[1:15:27] let's go to um first peter
[1:15:29] 5.
[1:15:31] it
[1:15:34] verse 3 to 5.
[1:15:38] i i've been dealing with some things
[1:15:40] i see things in me that i don't like
[1:15:43] the reason why i don't like them because
[1:15:45] god said
[1:15:46] amen i'm looking for more improvement
[1:15:49] in your life as a minister uh you know i
[1:15:53] in this
[1:15:54] first peter 5 it talks about the
[1:15:56] shepherd and the one to feed the flock
[1:15:59] he talked about the elders among you i
[1:16:01] exhaust
[1:16:02] amen which is also an elder
[1:16:05] and of the son
[1:16:06] a witness of the suffering of christ
[1:16:09] i don't find many want to suffer for
[1:16:12] christ
[1:16:13] and so
[1:16:14] peter was talking about i want to i want
[1:16:17] to be a example of the suffering of
[1:16:20] christ
[1:16:21] and because sometimes we don't
[1:16:25] as examples
[1:16:27] to the flaw
[1:16:28] of the suffering
[1:16:30] suffering of christ
[1:16:32] so make you re come back and reexamine
[1:16:34] as a
[1:16:36] as under shepherd to the sheep jefford
[1:16:39] that
[1:16:39] when
[1:16:40] you know look at jesus
[1:16:42] how he carried himself are you carrying
[1:16:45] yourself and your walk the same way
[1:16:47] you can't expect of the people what
[1:16:49] you're not expecting of yourself
[1:16:52] are you with me
[1:16:54] for the husband must be first partaker
[1:16:55] of the fruit
[1:16:57] so if you're asking the people to be
[1:16:59] more humble then you got to become more
[1:17:01] humble
[1:17:02] are you with me
[1:17:04] so uh and i said god help me amen
[1:17:08] help me to examine and see who i am
[1:17:11] that i can present a better example
[1:17:15] to the flock
[1:17:16] are you with me
[1:17:18] so no it doesn't matter you know when
[1:17:20] the word when god speak to you amen you
[1:17:22] say yes lord
[1:17:27] but it takes the grace of god can help
[1:17:29] you
[1:17:30] to maintain what he said
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:36] so he
[1:17:38] you you got me in the first i mean first
[1:17:40] street of five
[1:17:42] it says
[1:17:43] uh in five let's look there because i
[1:17:46] i don't want to read all of that okay
[1:17:48] likewise what you're younger what
[1:17:50] younger submit yourself unto the elders
[1:17:53] yay all of you it used to be
[1:17:56] any elder any grown-up
[1:17:59] children were to give respect to
[1:18:02] and they said something to them
[1:18:05] you got some of these little small
[1:18:06] children who won't even listen to adult
[1:18:09] at all
[1:18:11] why because it's the spirit of this age
[1:18:15] are you with me
[1:18:17] they won't listen to the teacher in
[1:18:18] school they won't listen to
[1:18:22] you know what the folks say if they
[1:18:24] won't listen
[1:18:26] now
[1:18:28] you know the road up ahead where they'll
[1:18:30] be
[1:18:32] are you with me
[1:18:34] they either be dead are they in prison
[1:18:37] are you with me
[1:18:39] so it's better to listen
[1:18:42] and
[1:18:42] to the elders as they try to train you
[1:18:45] and try to tell you listen to your
[1:18:47] parents listen to what they say and hear
[1:18:50] what they got to say
[1:18:51] instead of playing games while you're in
[1:18:53] church
[1:18:55] and got a telephone
[1:18:57] you got to throw that telephone in the
[1:18:59] garbage
[1:19:05] why are you with me
[1:19:07] you see why why the devil will blind
[1:19:09] certain people
[1:19:11] you let them instead of listening to the
[1:19:13] word
[1:19:14] they can't even hear the word for what
[1:19:16] they're doing
[1:19:20] okay
[1:19:21] go ahead and read
[1:19:23] yeah all of you be subject one
[1:19:25] one to another and be close with
[1:19:28] humility each one got to be subject one
[1:19:30] to another all of us
[1:19:33] he didn't say he didn't leave the
[1:19:35] preacher out he said all of you
[1:19:38] are you with me subject one to another
[1:19:41] okay go right here
[1:19:42] and be clothed with humility
[1:19:45] that's what i say he said be clothed
[1:19:47] with humility clothe with it
[1:19:51] go ahead but god resists the prowl and
[1:19:54] giveth grace to the humble
[1:19:57] and see if we want more grace if we want
[1:19:59] the grace of god he gives it to who
[1:20:03] the humble
[1:20:07] go ahead
[1:20:09] humble yourselves therefore
[1:20:11] under the mighty hand of god
[1:20:14] that he may exhaust
[1:20:15] he says to you as individuals to what
[1:20:19] not that god's going to humble you he
[1:20:21] said for you to what
[1:20:24] you to do it
[1:20:28] humble yourself
[1:20:30] in in every aspect of our lives it's
[1:20:33] areas that we need correction in
[1:20:37] you know what i'm saying it may not be
[1:20:39] what god what i need correction in it
[1:20:41] may not be the area you need correction
[1:20:43] in but we all can stand some correction
[1:20:48] god can help us all be better
[1:20:52] and that's what the word of god if god
[1:20:53] wants to make us better christians
[1:20:56] that we might be prepared to meet him
[1:20:59] when he called
[1:21:02] you got to be willing to answer his
[1:21:04] calling
[1:21:05] okay
[1:21:06] so
[1:21:08] read on
[1:21:10] humble yourselves he says go
[1:21:12] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:21:14] that he may exalt you in due time now
[1:21:18] lucifer had the attitude i would exalt
[1:21:21] what
[1:21:22] i was up my throne
[1:21:25] see i i'm exalt my throne he had the
[1:21:27] attitude i'mma exalt mine and you know
[1:21:31] when god gives you a gift of talent
[1:21:36] the bible said a man gift will make what
[1:21:39] sometimes we god gives us a gift and we
[1:21:42] make room for ourselves
[1:21:49] and if god allows your gift to be
[1:21:52] overlooked
[1:21:55] then thank god that he allows it for a
[1:21:57] purpose
[1:22:01] somebody says uh uh
[1:22:03] folks having not acknowledged my gift
[1:22:06] the things that i do in the kingdom of
[1:22:08] god it's not being
[1:22:10] appreciated who gonna appreciate it
[1:22:13] who you want to appreciate
[1:22:15] who you want to praise you
[1:22:18] we all get into
[1:22:21] the attitude sometimes that
[1:22:23] who cares about
[1:22:25] you
[1:22:26] who cares about me
[1:22:28] we get a little self-pity you know
[1:22:30] all of us
[1:22:31] you know everybody comes to those places
[1:22:34] that uh elijah he's under his juniper he
[1:22:37] said lord you they don't kill all the
[1:22:39] prophets and i'm here alone by myself
[1:22:41] god said i got 7 000 had not battled
[1:22:45] are you with me so we all get a little
[1:22:47] you know
[1:22:49] uh in places in in our lives that we
[1:22:52] feel like amen we need to have a little
[1:22:55] uh uh
[1:22:56] conference with god a little pity party
[1:22:59] you know
[1:23:01] because we want to be
[1:23:02] appreciated and
[1:23:04] respected are you with me
[1:23:07] but sometimes god allows certain things
[1:23:10] to happen in our walk and in our lives
[1:23:13] amen that he's working humility and it
[1:23:16] is in the time opponent
[1:23:18] god will lift you up
[1:23:22] yes
[1:23:23] god has an appointed time that he's
[1:23:26] going to do for you
[1:23:28] amen now now i'm going to tell you
[1:23:30] something when we want it so bad that it
[1:23:33] hurts so bad
[1:23:34] then god is saying let it hurt some more
[1:23:39] are you with me
[1:23:41] because it's hurting who
[1:23:43] it's not hurting god it's hurting you
[1:23:47] and god is trying to get rid of you
[1:23:48] because you're not ready for what you
[1:23:52] want until it don't hurt no more
[1:23:56] amen what you think you want you're not
[1:23:58] ready for it where you think you ought
[1:24:00] to be you're not there
[1:24:05] but there are others that's going to
[1:24:06] exalt you
[1:24:09] are you with me
[1:24:10] there are those that will exalt you and
[1:24:12] lift you up
[1:24:16] and make you feel like you are important
[1:24:20] you got the vip
[1:24:22] treatment
[1:24:24] are you with me
[1:24:26] i find in most ministers they're worried
[1:24:28] about their ministry
[1:24:31] their their self image
[1:24:34] where they want to go where they want to
[1:24:36] be
[1:24:36] they want to be great
[1:24:41] and i wanted the call of god that god
[1:24:43] really called them
[1:24:47] because they want to be famous
[1:24:50] they want to be great ministers
[1:24:52] they think of themselves
[1:24:54] more highly than they ought to think
[1:24:59] and people want to follow people that
[1:25:01] they believe that are great
[1:25:03] the crowds the multitudes follow the
[1:25:04] great preachers
[1:25:09] but the humble
[1:25:12] they don't want that
[1:25:14] that's why the crowds
[1:25:16] packed the billy grahams and all rivals
[1:25:19] and then the prophet you know though god
[1:25:21] was using it mightily yet he was
[1:25:24] you know i i
[1:25:28] i want to show you something that hit my
[1:25:30] hit my heart really heavy this morning

[1:26:11] of what jesus had to go through for you

[1:26:17] that the way
[1:26:19] up is the way down
[1:26:25] the god will take you down before he
[1:26:27] raises you up
[1:26:31] david went through a lot of
[1:26:33] disappointment in denial and rejection
[1:26:37] before god put him on the throne joseph
[1:26:39] went through a lot of denial and
[1:26:41] rejection and
[1:26:42] before he was
[1:26:44] put on the throne
[1:26:47] and god wants to exalt you but god
[1:26:50] cannot exalt you if you exalt yourself
[1:26:56] if you're so interested in
[1:26:58] who you are and what you want to be then
[1:27:01] god can never make you
[1:27:04] what he wants you to be
[1:27:07] because you've already
[1:27:09] had an image in your mind of where you
[1:27:12] want to go and what you want to be you
[1:27:14] want to be successful you want to be
[1:27:16] great you want to be somebody that's to
[1:27:18] respect it
[1:27:22] but i'ma say the world love is on
[1:27:29] you'll be despised and rejected amen go
[1:27:31] ahead um
[1:27:33] um
[1:27:35] i said 53 and 10 please yet it pleased
[1:27:38] the lord to bruise him

[1:27:47] it please the lord to what
[1:27:51] do you understand yet it pleased the
[1:27:53] lord to bruise him
[1:27:56] go ahead he have put him to greed
[1:27:59] he had put him to grief
[1:28:02] go ahead when thou shalt make his soul
[1:28:04] offering for sin but that's what it's
[1:28:07] all about god shall make his soul
[1:28:09] an offering for sin
[1:28:12] he that knew no sin was made sin for us
[1:28:16] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:28:18] of god in him
[1:28:20] go ahead read on he shall see his seed
[1:28:24] he should see his seed what he was going
[1:28:25] through he wasn't going through for
[1:28:26] himself he was going through that for us
[1:28:29] he should see his seed
[1:28:32] go ahead he shall prolong his days yes
[1:28:34] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[1:28:36] prosper in his hands go ahead he shall
[1:28:38] see of the travail of his soul and shalt
[1:28:41] be satisfied
[1:28:43] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:28:46] servant justify many
[1:28:48] god
[1:28:49] god
[1:28:50] it please
[1:28:52] him
[1:28:53] it please god to let jesus go through
[1:28:56] what he went through
[1:28:58] are you with me
[1:29:00] and yet you said
[1:29:01] you know
[1:29:03] he said this is my beloved son in whom
[1:29:06] i'm well pleased
[1:29:08] the bible said you know amen without our
[1:29:12] walk is with god like enough before his
[1:29:15] before he was translated he had a
[1:29:17] testimony that he what
[1:29:19] please god
[1:29:21] brother and sister our pleasing god is a
[1:29:24] is a road of suffering
[1:29:28] but it's a road of humility
[1:29:31] when we can get out the way and let god
[1:29:34] jesus said not my will
[1:29:37] but lucifer i will
[1:29:41] i will exalt my throne
[1:29:43] the bible says amen let this mind be in
[1:29:46] your philippians 2 it's also in christ
[1:29:48] jesus who being in the form of god
[1:29:50] thought it not robbery to be what
[1:29:52] eagle with the god was made of himself
[1:29:54] no
[1:29:55] reputation
[1:29:57] we made of himself the form of a servant
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:02] god amen actually humbled himself and he
[1:30:05] suffered
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:08] and he said wherefore god has highly
[1:30:10] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:30:13] is above every name
[1:30:15] are you with me
[1:30:17] when you when you after you suffered a
[1:30:19] while i wish i can get to some places
[1:30:22] that i would like to get there
[1:30:24] you know but the thing is we try to
[1:30:26] bypass our suffering part we try to go
[1:30:29] around it amen but we don't
[1:30:33] this is not play play church this is not
[1:30:35] just trying to tell you something to
[1:30:37] make you feel good this is a way that
[1:30:39] god even walked us walk and he lived
[1:30:42] that kind of life and he wants you to be
[1:30:45] particulars of his
[1:30:46] suffering amen
[1:30:49] god wants you to walk that wall
[1:30:52] amen he told brother brown because
[1:30:54] you're chosen the hard way
[1:30:57] but this is my way
[1:31:00] that's what he chose he didn't choose
[1:31:02] the easel because you chose he could
[1:31:04] have uh took those all that money to
[1:31:06] people trying to give
[1:31:07] he didn't do it
[1:31:10] are you with me
[1:31:12] you know you look at you look at people
[1:31:14] and the choices people make they try to
[1:31:17] get around the suffering part and what
[1:31:19] folks will think about them and sell
[1:31:21] bottom they try to get around that they
[1:31:23] don't want the suffering behind
[1:31:29] people want to be men pleasers they want
[1:31:31] to please themselves not god
[1:31:38] how you going to get around it brother
[1:31:40] sis
[1:31:44] did you finish
[1:31:45] go ahead
[1:31:46] but he shall bear their iniquities
[1:31:49] that's what it's all about
[1:31:51] battling
[1:31:52] he should bear their iniquities
[1:31:55] and god he did that for us but what are
[1:31:58] you doing
[1:32:00] i'm going to tell you something we don't
[1:32:02] want to deal with our
[1:32:04] our person our personality
[1:32:06] because we've been that way so long and
[1:32:08] we've been saved so long
[1:32:10] and you know
[1:32:12] some people you know
[1:32:14] even when they talk they talk mean
[1:32:20] they don't have a
[1:32:21] humble you know
[1:32:23] i always tell people my attraction to
[1:32:25] the message of the owl
[1:32:27] is because i saw a humble prophet
[1:32:35] he wasn't
[1:32:36] trying to send everybody to hell and
[1:32:38] blasting everybody and that his gift was
[1:32:41] so you know it was a humble person
[1:32:44] and then i re-examined myself
[1:32:47] and you know
[1:32:49] it was it was showing us
[1:32:52] a humility that
[1:32:55] should be
[1:32:56] we we just can't look at the prophet and
[1:32:58] say oh he was a humble man what about
[1:33:01] you and i
[1:33:04] what's our humility look at jesus what
[1:33:06] he did
[1:33:08] the ones that spit on him and lied on
[1:33:11] him and
[1:33:12] whipped him and beat him and
[1:33:15] yet
[1:33:17] he was dying for them
[1:33:20] brother you know how do we feel
[1:33:23] sometimes when we're taking advantage of
[1:33:25] how do we feel sometimes when
[1:33:28] you know sometimes
[1:33:29] we have the wrong pers
[1:33:32] perception of others
[1:33:36] because we're so busy looking at their
[1:33:38] faults that we can't see our home
[1:33:43] because
[1:33:44] if we really looked in the mirror we'll
[1:33:46] see so much that we can't even see
[1:33:48] others because we see so much in us
[1:33:51] that we need working home
[1:33:54] you know
[1:33:56] to others won't matter no more because
[1:33:58] god i i need to get this
[1:34:01] house in order
[1:34:03] lord i need to get my life
[1:34:05] you know help me to humble myself
[1:34:09] oh god i want to do your will i want to
[1:34:12] please you lord
[1:34:14] that's what i want
[1:34:16] god that's what i want i want to please
[1:34:18] god
[1:34:20] praise god amen forget about yourself
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:32] it's better our knickers is
[1:34:34] therefore
[1:34:36] will i divide
[1:34:38] him
[1:34:39] a portion with the great
[1:34:41] that's what happens because of what he
[1:34:44] done because of what went on with jesus
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:50] therefore will i divide him a portion
[1:34:52] with the great
[1:34:53] and he shall divide the spoil with just
[1:34:57] what
[1:34:58] strong
[1:34:59] because
[1:35:00] he has what
[1:35:02] he's pulled out his soul unto death
[1:35:07] he was numbered with the what
[1:35:09] transgressors
[1:35:11] and he bear
[1:35:13] the sins of many
[1:35:15] and made intercession for the
[1:35:17] transgressors
[1:35:20] are you with me
[1:35:21] usually we read isaiah 53 and five he
[1:35:24] was one of the five transgressions boots
[1:35:26] right nick
[1:35:27] just you know with the strikes we heal
[1:35:29] and so forth but the latter part
[1:35:33] it rained to me this morning
[1:35:36] it really meant something
[1:35:39] and i wish i could just break the whole
[1:35:41] message down and just really spend time
[1:35:44] and just
[1:35:45] telling you more
[1:35:47] but by the grace of god
[1:35:49] time what fails
[1:35:55] but i i wish you could penetrate
[1:35:59] i wish you could re-examine your life
[1:36:02] and say god
[1:36:05] where's my humility
[1:36:11] why
[1:36:13] are you calling us to humility
[1:36:17] forget about all this
[1:36:20] the bible says christ forgave
[1:36:22] you forgive one another
[1:36:27] are you with me
[1:36:29] walk in love
[1:36:32] are you with me
[1:36:34] love one another
[1:36:38] are you with me
[1:36:40] take advantage of the word this morning
[1:36:43] be partakers of this world this morning
[1:36:46] and walk in humility
[1:36:49] are you with me
[1:36:50] when you leave here don't walk with the
[1:36:52] uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a complaint
[1:36:56] in your spirit or an an imagination that
[1:36:59] would not profit you but lord help me to
[1:37:03] see that i need
[1:37:05] to be more humble
[1:37:08] i want it
[1:37:11] as we stand this morning
[1:37:16] what about you friend
[1:37:18] sister brother
[1:37:25] the bible says the captain of our
[1:37:27] salvation was made perfect through
[1:37:29] suffering
[1:37:33] and i believe god wants to make you
[1:37:35] perfect
[1:37:37] for he says be perfect as your father
[1:37:40] which is in heaven
[1:37:42] after you suffered a while then he
[1:37:44] strengthened you established you
[1:37:47] amen
[1:37:48] he went on to say he'll make you
[1:37:50] perfect
[1:37:52] praise god
[1:37:53] god wants to make you perfect but your
[1:37:55] perfection come through suffering
[1:37:58] are you with me
[1:38:00] but if you get around suffering how can
[1:38:02] you be perfected how can you be made
[1:38:04] perfect if you don't want to suffer
[1:38:10] somebody says well
[1:38:12] i i'm not going to do it
[1:38:14] praise god
[1:38:17] wherefore god has highly exalted him
[1:38:22] and giving him a name which is above
[1:38:24] every name
[1:38:25] that at the name of jesus christ every
[1:38:27] knee shall bow
[1:38:29] and every tongue should confess to jesus
[1:38:31] christ is lord to the glory of god the
[1:38:34] father
[1:38:36] one day you'll confess
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] that he's the lord
[1:38:42] and you want to say lord have mercy
[1:38:46] have mercy on my soul
[1:38:49] have mercy in my life
[1:38:52] as our his about hearts are looking to
[1:38:54] him

[1:41:11] to come down in flesh
[1:41:14] and to die on the cross
[1:41:18] oh god he became so low
[1:41:22] that he even went down in hell itself
[1:41:26] oh god now he's lifted up with all power

[1:41:32] i thank you now
[1:41:34] i thank you
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:39] i want to be identified with him
[1:41:43] not only in his suffering but in his
[1:41:45] resurrection
[1:41:48] thank you lord
[1:41:50] thank you lord amen
[1:41:53] i want to say amen thank you lord
[1:41:57] you're not
[1:41:58] repented of your sins been baptized in
[1:42:01] water
[1:42:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:42:04] the remission of sin
[1:42:06] then this morning the opportunity is
[1:42:08] yours
[1:42:10] now we can walk in our pride or we can
[1:42:12] humble ourselves
[1:42:14] it's up to us not to me not to brother
[1:42:17] simmons
[1:42:18] but in the sight of the lord
[1:42:22] he said humble yourselves in the sight
[1:42:24] of the lord
[1:42:26] and he will exalt you
[1:42:29] are you a man
[1:42:31] so it's not in the sight of men
[1:42:33] but it's inside humble yourselves in the
[1:42:35] sight of the lord and he will lift you
[1:42:40] up but god resists the proud but he
[1:42:44] gives what
[1:42:46] you give grace to the what
[1:42:48] humble
[1:42:49] so brother and sister the bible is
[1:42:51] calling you
[1:42:52] to repentance he's calling you he's
[1:42:54] calling me he's calling each and every
[1:42:56] one of us to repent of our sins
[1:42:59] be baptized in water in the name of
[1:43:00] jesus christ
[1:43:02] it's up to us whether or not we obey him
[1:43:05] or not
[1:43:07] god bless you this morning
[1:43:17] i want to say
[1:43:19] time is winding up
[1:43:23] die was late
[1:43:26] it's later than we think
[1:43:30] so you're gonna run you better run now
[1:43:33] it wasn't a shouting message this
[1:43:35] morning
[1:43:37] but it was a message that we all can
[1:43:40] examine ourselves
[1:43:42] see where we stand
[1:43:44] see can we be more kind more tender
[1:43:47] hearted

[1:44:04] word comes
[1:44:07] to penetrate the hardness of heart
[1:44:10] and to soften our hearts up
[1:44:14] as
