was on the way to tennessee he called me in spartanburg and he almost talked me all the way there since the symbols called him and said your breakfast ready i said you better go ahead on the knee he's i got meat she don't know about amen he said you remember you preached that message we're gonna break protocol and uh he said i'm breaking protocol i said well you better keep protocoling underneath the maze he didn't know she better keep protocol he said god is ahead of christ christ has to hit a man and the man is the head of the woman i see i better hang up now but thank god for being here tonight i enjoyed the word thank god for seeing all the old and we'll be praying for you all pray for us by the grace of god [Applause] amen appreciate the word tonight brother nathan hey man he called me at work amen he's a brother called i'm on fire i said i talked with him a few minutes about 30 minutes that's brother nathan i could get back out here he's okay brother but i i appreciate the fight that god has put in his heart and like he said a paradox when something happens to you it's personal and when you have that happen to you it generates a combustion chamber of love in you for what god has done for you nobody else he's done it for but he done it for you and that will start a fire burning on the inside as jeremiah said it's like fire shut up in my bones i don't want to say nothing else but jeremiah could not stop talking because what was shut up in him and god said you will be a witness after the holy ghost come upon you amen brother brad your dad wants you to stand up so everybody can see man praise the lord when they said don't call the whole city [Laughter] call me and say brother palmer i'm coming your way i said what are you talking about coming my way i will be in colombia he said tell him i'm coming that's about the name that said are they okay brother i'm on fire he's saying i ain't talking about it yesterday for evil i'm talking about a fire right now i said brother nathan i said didn't bring the fire i thank god for brother nathan i didn't get a phone call from him i guess he he probably figured i should be here tonight i thank god for him anyways man he know he's been my pastor he i say he's still my pastor my brother sims my bishop so you know it's been i've been raised under brother nathan ministry and uh he always been a blessing to me and one thing about it he gonna always tell you the truth i remember when the lord first saved me and uh we went down to louisiana me him and brother simmons and uh i was telling him how i was out witnessing and i hadn't been saved long brother nathan told me he said you are witnessing i said yeah he said you need to get the holy ghost for you go out witness that he quoted that scripture after you receive the holy ghost then you'll be witnesses so you know but people call that hard but one thing about it brother nathan will always tell you the truth i mean he gonna always tell you the truth i remember when the lord uh called me to the ministry and started ministering the gospel yeah i've been ministering maybe a couple years but i was down in mullins and uh i was preaching you know it seemed like everybody enjoyed the word and all brother nathan and he got up behind me he said he says brother ernest one of them uh he said he wanted those nice preachers he said see he ain't gonna tell you like me and his pastor go tell you he said we gonna tell you you know he said he told you but we gonna tell you but one thing i know i know like i said with my brother nathan he gonna tell you the truth and i can always respect the man like that because he that's his heart right there and i i i can say right now you know i never never out all the years one thing about it he always had a love of god in his heart always opened his home to me me and his children grew up together all of us were good all are still good friends you know but i just say i always been blessed by his ministry even here tonight i i kind of wonder myself i told my wife i says he called and i says you know i hope nothing ain't going on with them i told my wife that i said lord i hope nothing ain't going on with them i was telling uh i don't know if you remember me telling him about telling him and i was talking to brother simmons here i i said you know i i pray that the lord he thought terry he couldn't get all of us i said because i don't want i see i love the old saints i love the old ministry the old ministers the old old soldiers because i said that they're the ones right now that when i talk about the pillars come on i said that that's what we need today i always preaching here lately i said god we need another revival like we had in the days of old the one that i the revivals that i grew up on how i seen and how to fear god was on the people not that they was afraid of the ministry but they saw god in the in the church and i said lord that's what uh the young people need to see today you know i got young people i got young children growing up to be teenagers and you know they start and experience things and the things they dealing with i ain't had to deal with the things they're exposed to i wasn't exposed to so how how much more we need god in a supernatural way now more than we ever did to watch over our children because we can't guard them but i said and that's what i've been praying that's what's been in my heart i said lord we need a old-fashioned holy ghost revival not just a meeting church service and all that that's that's good but god we need change that's what we need and uh and i know that the only way that's gonna come is gonna have to come by god and god alone because that's what happened to me i always shared a testimony i always said that when i got saved i used to pray and i said lord i need i need the holy ghost because i'm afraid of myself i don't even know what i'm capable of because what it is you know i grew up in a church under all the word and all but you don't think sometimes you'll get that far but what happens you just stay on the outskirts and what happens the devil get hold to you and he carries you out there so far too you don't even know how you're going to get back i remember i was riding with my mom in the car and i broke down crying because i had people calling me 7 16 17 years old with death threats and stuff threatening they gonna do all kind of stuff for me so i i told my mom i never intended to get where i am right now but you know nobody never does but i thank god i had a praying mama not only a praying mama i had a praying uh a grandmom i had a praying church that stayed on the altar praying because i know that the prayers of god brought me through people always talk about you know and i know that like we say that i tell my wife all the time i know i'm long-winded but i tell my wife all the time like what the lord has blessed us with you know i never in in a million years could imagine what god has done for us so many supernatural things i can't stand before you and say bye nothing that i've done that i got anything that i got or achieved anything or been blessed with i know that it's only been by the grace of god because when i look at so many that i walk with and where they are now i was talking to someone the other day and i said i said i was sharing with them i said i can't look down on you i said because it was only the grace of god in my life and i said that if you got a desire to be saved that same grace is still here for you today no matter where you are or what you've done just to even have the desire i said all you got to do is give it to god come on and let god let god uh have his way in your life and that's my desire i pray so i thank god for brother nathan like i said tonight he's all he always been a blessing to me and he he knows that he always welcome you know all the time i thank the lord for him like it says if if you don't want the truth then don't ask him because he gonna give you the truth i was telling somebody that the other day when they was wanting to speak with the bishop i told him i said if you don't want the truth then don't ask it but if you want the truth then i i know they'll give you the truth how many believe that tonight [Applause] praise god we thank god i said we're in revival but i'm sorry to say time let's come to the end if god don't have mercy america will be blowed to pieces that's the seventh vision whether we believe the prophet or not if the bombs fall it was after they had pierced his side and had killed him and the darkness covered the place somebody said truly this was the son of god that seven vision the sixth vision a woman vice president of president the seven he saw america being blown to pieces by russia whether he's false or true time might tell it in a few days time might tell it in a few days but somebody wake up and say oh [Music] he was telling the truth but where would we be see i didn't believe it it's like the young lady at brother thompson the nurse was in the room the doctor pulled the cover back and said brother thompson mom had cancer head and spread it all over she was brain dead and everything and the nurse says i said the family believing and i'm believing with them they said go out there and tell them that she brain dead if she come out of it she ain't gonna be number the vegetable you go look here pull the cover back say look at that all over her body you might as well forget it and i said well i said i tried to tell some testimonies and the little nurse said not this lady here i don't care what you're trying to tell me testimony and the doctor stood in there the family believed and i'm saying when she came out brother keith had a revival over to the hospital and i went over there saw that little nurse in the room with the family and she started walking down the hall and i saw her walking down the hall and she grabbed me and she hugged me and she started crying she said you believed you didn't believe i didn't believe you believe i don't want us to have one of those moments that all of a sudden we you become believers when it's too late to believe all of a sudden we want god when it's no god to be found the spirit of the lord gonna live off of the earth he's going back over to with the jews moses and elijah over there and the jews receiving the gospel and the gentiles days cut off all of a sudden everybody wakes up and said oh what's going on i read in mueller's last night you know they said uh at any time the earthquake can hit california it's looming it's right there they just they just put it in the news says san francisco the bay area they said they're looking any day now anytime and if it hit it's like a hundred atomic bombs hitting if that earthquake hits so if russia don't hit the earthquake hit where are we then brother and sister i said what you said what are you saying all of that they can't trying to get escape i said i can't scare you but jesus died on the cross that's the thing it's not the fear it's the love of god he died for your sin and he shed and expressed his blood and he loves you he cares about you but do you care or we will we reject his love for us will we turn around to lord i don't care what you die for it don't mean a thing to me and i don't want your love or will we say lord i want to receive your love your mercy while i can get mercy i want mercy now and i want to say god i'm sorry i'm sorry for the way i live the way i behave and conducting my life because if you come i want to be ready i want to go back with you i don't want to be left behind lord i want to go with you brother and sister this is our time praise god you just can't expect to be raptured any kind of way i look at people and i'm trying to tell them about the lord but they're satisfied with their church they're satisfied with you know halfway living and doing all kind of ungodly stuff and still they satisfied that they got god brother and sister if we don't wake up thank god for brother nathan it's been encouragement to me i said i'm going down to help my brother i said my wife says i know that's the law i know that the lord to put that on your heart and christian she started crying she said i know the lord sent you to hell since the center those and brother nathan everybody said the lord sent you to hell praise god and when i saw him i said if he ain't got but a few more days i want to spend those days happening but when i got there i i said lord it's going to do something i

know god is god and he don't never change praise god you have the opportunity brother and sister if you want to receive the love of god it's your opportunity to receive it but if the somehow you you know there's so many things that would blind us and keep us away from god it just don't it it's something god god got to speak to you uh uh uh uh he got to speak to your heart he's got to deal with you as an individual he's got to say something amen that let you know he's real amen it is worth it for you to give him your heart giving your life and serve him but only god can do that for you we can preach all you want mama can talk grandmama can talk all of that is good but god's got to move with you i pray something that brother nathan said tonight would help us because i see what the lord did for him and i see what the lord is doing in his life he's been a great encouragement to me all these years and i said if my brother go within what is it i ain't got nobody sometimes standing with
