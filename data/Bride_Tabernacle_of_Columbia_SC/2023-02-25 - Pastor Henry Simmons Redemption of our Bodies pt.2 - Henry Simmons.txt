redemption and what it means we talked about sealed until the day of redemption and then we'll talk to about the Redemption of the body on Sunday amen so we want to continue on in the 23rd verse Romans 8 it says and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits even we all say has grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to do it the Redemption of our bodies may God bless the read those words you may be seated the Redemption of our bodies we're waiting on that to happen amen so one writer says if our Earthly house let's just look at Second Corinthians 5. and we won't what's in store for a Christian why is it what is the benefit what is what's God plan on why should we come to church and why should we serve the Lord and um it's all about what God is Promised You and I God has made a promise and God keeps his promises and God has made a promise to that we could have an inheritance and we were saying in Mullins last night and the Harris is that fate is not away an Incorruptible inheritance and this is what it's all about brother sister Christian that's something that they look at God has in store for them something that we're looking forward to I was telling a little bit about you know I was out walking and you know we were just praying as a walk and then it came on me about God through faith we understand through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God through faith we understand and we understand that faith is a revelation amen we can only get what we expect amen faith is a revelation and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God praise God so the things that we see amen praise God God made them for nothing he spoke them into existence amen God is good amen so by the grace of God I'm not going to try to I was preaching last night for about 15 minutes but the night I see we got very quiet so I'm not going to get excited by myself amen so brother Nathan say I'm coming I'm coming I said don't come he was so stirred he said I'm coming I'm gonna give me a ride I'm coming I said don't come I said he said who's going to speak I said the Lord's will I continue on on the Redemption of the body amen but here it says in all second Corinthians 5 4 we know now everybody don't know that but he was talking to the Christian and believable he said well we know see it's something that he he he it must he must have already taught them they must have had some kind of Pride knowledge he said because we know amen everybody don't have that understanding that's why it won't come to church and they're lost they're just Center days they're doing it because amen they're made to come traditional but he said but we know amen it's something that we know praise God hallelujah I said through faith we understand praise God we can't understand without faith without faith amen it's impossible for you to understand but through faith we understand it's God through faith we understand so if it takes Faith to understand God's plan for you amen and then they look at he's turning around for we know and you you know we talked about job said I know when he was going through all his troubles and the wife tried to get him to curse God and all that but but he had something that he knew he said I know that what my redeem will live amen he's not dead I know he lives I know my redeemer lived praise God he had confidence see once you've got that amen inside and you got you got something amen they're causing you to go on Amen I don't care what's going on around here I don't care what the devil has done to you praise God hallelujah [Laughter] I'm fired up right why amen well we know through faith we understand amen praise God you're a faith civilization amen we walked by what by Fame not by so we know how do you know amen something on the inside I can't explain Faith to you but through faith we know we understand praise God I got to understand how can you explain faith for faith is the substance of things what and it's evidence of things except God gives you the grace Amen to see or to believe it they meant to open up the eyes of your understanding except God do it amen you can't see it you go coming to church amen you you'll get a cutting book and you'll begin to color you'll get a writing pan and you begin to write you'll start to staring and you look at your phone and you start texting but when you know praise God I come to hear from God I come to hear God's word for we know the power of the word well if you don't know the power of the word that word of God is quick it's powerful amen through faith we know we understand amen I know my redeemer lives praise God it's something about when you know he lived praise God hallelujah she might be your next old neighbor it might be the one sitting next to you don't know but when you know oh Hallelujah it's just a fire in your soul it makes a whole lot when your wife said curse your God and die amen when the balls are all of his bodies oh Hallelujah he said don't you sleep I'm still gonna trust him because he had something about he said there's an appointed time praise God it's an appointed time I know amen praise God and my redeem will live and he has appointed a Time that at the latter day he'll stand though the skin worms eat the spirits yet in my flesh shall I see God Hallelujah I know amen I know amen that there is a body change on the way I know something is getting ready to hop on praise God something that's getting ready I believe we're closer now amen it looked like we're closer to the nuclear wall but we're closer to the body change when you see all these things come to pass then look up because you'll read your Redemption drawing now praise God that's the problem with my next Pawn your Redemption drawing now it's coming amen if I it might have held back for even 2 000 years but it's drawing now it's right around the corner brother praise God you know let me just go there's three parts of the body the body Soul and Spirit right God Ezekiel talked about he'll give us a new spirit and then he'll put his Spirit within us amen he said for we know that if our Earthly House of this tavern that could be dissolved we have a what a building of God a what this body is a house it's the Temple of the Holy Ghost it's where God is amen we have a house this is the house of God are you with me praise God he said the church and he's pressured with his own blood amen this is the house where God dwells you bought with the price and you're not your own this is the house of God praise God when you know amen that deity dwells within the Earthly vessels amen God has put his divine nature inside of you amen by one Spirit or you're baptized into what what bodies and it's an invisible Union took place amen you and God become one praise God by one Spirit you're baptized into one body father make them one even as We Are One praise God the soul flesh is hiding something praise God that is Veil bravement at the Tabernacle amen had that Veil there into the holy of Holiness amen so amen is God Amen praise God behind the veil praise God and the Mighty God is being unveiled before you now amen praise God is Not amen amen amen being but it's a mighty God being unveiled amen is the unveiling of God praise God God is showing amen his attributes he's showing who he is amen praise God at God Jesus Christ in broad form amen God unveiling himself but you you're looking for somewhere out there somewhere around there but the Mighty God is being unveiled praise God Jesus was God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and Christ is in you amen what is he doing in you praise God what is God's purpose what is God plan for you are you just you know he didn't come to reside in you just to reside in you but that you might amen manifest or show who God is in this present hour so you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and if the Holy Ghost is God amen and then it's the spirit of God is God then what is it God is trying to use you Amen to manifest himself the Bible said God was manifested in what flesh isn't that right so we saw Jesus Christ as me and the word made flesh and now amen diesel sinful bodies amen praise God with all corruptible bodies but we have a tragedy inside of these bodies but one thing about these bodies we're talking about the Redemption of the our bodies amen we'll we will seal until the day of redemption are you with me we'll seal until the day of redemption we have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb are you with me but one day amen this body got to drop amen and you will see that God that was hit in the Earthly vessels are you up there Jesus one day he with the body that he had a resurrected body he walked through the door amen you didn't have to uh open the door just walk through praise God the prophet talk about us traveling as a thought oh praise God it's coming a Time amen that you won't have to get on an airplane you can travel as a thought Lex Phillip was caught up are you up man and he met the Union amen God Amen can do it are you up there so what happens amen get you in Ratchet condition your bodies amen praise God cannot contain cannot hold what God has in store for us so we need a new body to house it the more we come in vision and Christ is formed in US and when Christ is fully amen form they make this body cannot contain the prophet said he can't keep himself from you you become so much like him that he has to come right then or you have been so that's what has happened we got to come so much like God like Jesus are you a man that we can hear he can use our eyes he can use our tongue our lips you can use our mouth praise God we're so yielded to surrender to him he said the bride would not move unless you have thus said the Lord are you with me see you know what the mind of God is and you know what God wants to do at this within the time see you got to get in rhythm with the spirit but as long as you're doing what you want to do you'll never know what God wants see we got a will and God got a will amen I gotta go it says and this we grown earnestly designed to be closed with our house which is from heaven our house which is from heaven In My Father's House or what if it were not so what so he says the prophet of God talked about some of these things in the future home are you with me he said with our house to Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven I wish I could go I I I'm trying to do it I don't know how to con do it but let me oh our house which is from Heaven maybe I'll read a little bit and then go to the other description if so that being closed we should not be found what naked fall we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdens not that we should be that not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that what might be what swallowed up of life amen mortality might be swallowed up a life he said now he that is wrong us for the self same thing is God who also has given unto us the what earnings of the spirit of therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the what we are absent from for we want we want what we walk by faith not by sight isn't that right we walk by faith not by sight um First Corinthians 15 here I'm trying to connect to there's a there's a house your body is the house it's the Temple of the Holy Ghost he said in My Father's House of many mansions in my father's Kingdom there are many palaces in my father's house you're the house of God you know when he said and I saw a new Heaven and newer prepared as a bride of non for her husband are you with me with our house that comes down from heaven are you with me so amen there is a house that comes down from heaven the the new city was prepared as a bride or dawned for her husband y'all know who the bride is and she's a dawn for who her husband you know who your husband is the revealed word of the hour are you with me the bride knows her mate isn't that right so you know your mate amen you know who you married to the word you're married to Jesus Christ amen you're not married to some church some form some fashion some system but you're married to Jesus Christ he was the word and he said be not unequally yoked together with what unbelievers so you got to be equally yoked amen so what he was that all that God was he pulled into Christ and all that Christ was he put it in the church father make them warn even as We Are One you got to be one are you with me if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle this body this body amen he said no I'll man perish are you it's getting great I got the lady asked me today I was doing some work I mean don't get some work done just what color is your eyes I said Brown she said what color your hair I've been to say black I forgot my name like no more are y'all with me I said oh it's great and she laughed it's great uh she said salt and pepper whatever I said yeah it might be but seeing what I'm saying sometimes we feel pretty good and we forget that this island man is what perishing but the body that God has for you amen the Redemption of our bodies you got something that you're looking forward to if our Earthly house in this Tabernacle be dissolved we have a building a house not name in hand amen with a house that come down from heaven are you with me and God has given us the earnest of his spirit and what the spirit is doing as the word was formed and Mary so the word is being formed in you amen Jesus Christ was the spoken word that the Angels said the Jeremiah I mean Isaiah said that was prophesied amen a virgin seed spoken word seed amen so your spoken word seed you've been spoken into existence are you with me by faith amen you've been spoken into existence you heard the word faith come by what hearing and hearing about what word of God you've been spoken in existence amen you've spoken word see praise God because you're children of God by faith in Christ Jesus amen and what is it amen you understand that you're born again not of what corruptible seed but what and corruptible that's what's going on brother sister amen as you eat the word you become the word amen amen amen we're not just coming to church amen Christ is being formed amen the seed amen of Christ amen you can recognize amen this is the voice of of the shepherd amen and will sheep and we can know his voice and it's doing something to us that the word is not doing nothing to you it's not amen it it's not changing you amen then we're just going we like every other church and every other phone if the world ain't changing us if it's not quicker than us if it's not becoming life in US then we're just going to church like everybody else and I want to sing a song or or do this or that and no matter what just have a little good little show but it ain't about showing we want the word to be formed in US praise God feed me Lord till I want no more feed me amen praise God hallelujah that newborn babe this out of sin and sealed Miracle of the word that he might what grow thereby it's all about growing praise God hallelujah so here in First Corinthians 15. and 40. I had to skip a lot I wanted to read the whole thing but first excuse me he says they're also celestial bodies and the body's terrestrial but the glory of the celestra is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there's one glory of the sun another glory of the Moon another glory of the Stars for one star different from another in glory so also is the what resurrection of the dead it is sown in what corruption it is raised then what and Corruption so this body we talk about the Redemption of the body amen and Paul says that we should be changed are you with me it's something about you anticipating a body change now it has to be something by faith either was translated isn't that right so it must have was something that even if Faith come by hearing and hearing come by the word of God then the word of God gives us translation power amen the power to be changed amen there's got to be something that we're receiving he said behold I show you a mystery amen it's a mystery your body changes a mystery that's what Paul says here uh I got a whole Corinthians I'm trying to get there maybe y'all don't turn with me and I just read it okay Paul was saying he says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them that were asleep that's First Corinthians 4 it says uh in 16 for the Lord himself shall what descend from heaven with a shout are you with me now we understand the shout it's the message of the hour amen the voice of an archangel you understand the voice and what the voice does amen the Wake the bride amen so God has called us out with a shout you descended in a shower calling us together for a Rapture are you with me so things are happening in the spirit but people just going to church and just going to church and just singing and they're looking for the Rapture about not knowing the Rapture is taking place are you with me all the people looking for the messiah messiah right there by they were talking to the Messiah and couldn't even recognize him even Martha and Marino said I know that we'll see our brother again but they didn't know the resurrection was right there with him talking to him are you with me see what happens is things could be happening right among the people but the people can miss it because they didn't they they just think I I you know they just think that they think in another way they thinking that they're going to go to heaven they're going to be in the Rapture and not knowing what's going on with the in right around them this thing can be going on in the spirit realm that you you're not conscious of but Jesus was the Messiah and they were looking for the Messiah and they couldn't recognize them but God unveiled or revealed himself to the woman at the well he said I'm he as he ran and said come see a man and that's what he meant the resurrection and God is saying if I reveal myself to you you are running Talent you couldn't help yourself it'll set you on fire amen what's what's causing you to hold out and to hold on when the whole world is in chaos and confusion what causes you to want to live right and what causes you to wait for the Redemption of your body what causes you to wait amen because even some folks struggling and they're waiting but some folks are there amen I believe it's so much so amen I'm not going to let nothing turn me around I believe it's so much it doesn't matter what take place in life praise God I I I'm gonna have my body to change praise God I'm not gonna let nothing stop me amen it's something about Abraham and Sarah expecting to have the promised son and and all the expectation they got before Isaac could come it came to a place of impossibility that it was impossible for them to have a child Sarah won't then I ever happened you know they wouldn't even you know so how they gonna have somebody she as simple as Abraham and Sarah's body was changed right now before the people right now as they were walking they still the Bible said he stuck and not at the promises of God was unbelief but he was strong in faith he was receiving a body change when it was too late they meant to have a child when it was all up over and you can hang it up ain't no Rapture gonna take place hanging out Jesus ain't coming I see he coming amen I'mma have a body change though my hair getting gray praise God though this world is falling apart I'm still gonna have my body changed praise God and make a church money empty out but I'm gonna have a body team folk might turn them back and walk away from God but I'm Holding On I'mma wait till my change comes if it's something got to happen brother something got the heaven sister praise God I got the witness inside there praise God that's why I know I know amen oh it's something that must have been revealed deep enough in job though I lost cement it's kind of lost everything you had amen even his wife cursing him and amen he couldn't even have to accept but I'm still holding up amen praise God all the Deeds of my appointed time I'm gonna wait till my change gone praise God somebody call you crazy but I'm waiting brother and sister I'm telling you if you ain't got it like job had it then you ain't got it right praise God you got to get it amen don't no matter how this body look Abraham amen now God promised him a son and Sarah going to have it it's all right about hey God and all right amen about the poor and all that but I I mean oh what's the other what's up a woman named after Sarah Don y'all don't remember huh cultural that's right Good Tour amen Couture amen but Sarah amen Sarah gonna have that child isn't that right so what happened God did a body change right there before him can't you see God can change your body right here in this earth right here now if he can do it for Abraham and Sarah can't God do it for you but you see what happens when you got to be looking for it amen you got to be anticipating that body change isn't that right praise God you get no new body right here on the Earth praise God praise God indeed you know the Sleep the Bible said in the moment and the twinkling of an eye praise God what is happening things begin to gradually happen they met things began to gradually happen all over those exerting your teeth you lost them don't come back in your mouth you go to go put the false ones up there and you got some real ones say well somebody said you don't dye this hair now all of a sudden you get a body changed it ain't looking good all those aches and pains gone you know I lived and gone what's going on brother Fred you can reach for the stick and then you don't need no stick are you up man what happening what you've been waiting for it began to happen but nobody gonna believe you you're walking into your chains your body change all of a sudden you talking some crazy talk that you see the sanction going on and you're talking to somebody and they said all right brother Fred gone man are you with me because amen you don't got any cycle of the Rapture and you're looking he met beyond the courage of time amen you don't got so much in the spirit amen amen entertained began to happen Supernatural things begin to amen happen amen things begin to materialize praise God who gonna believe you they gonna say You're Gonna match you're going crazy amen I don't know what kind of medicine he took it they remember because he acting all up it'll be too late by the time they find out praise God you're gone are you with me praise God then you almost oh Lord Jesus you begin to see the invisible Realm you begin to enter into that other dimension how you have been brother and sister it'll happen so quick it'll be small things beginning to take place in your life just like when you got saved some small things you begin to shed this stop this stop that you didn't get where you was all at once all of a sudden you know amen you well far into your Christian walk amen praise God you're so far in to amen ain't no way you're gonna go back are you up here I I'll come too far to turn around oh you have been so what I'm saying what did Abraham and Sarah do is that they stagger not at the promises of God through unbelief whether strong and Faith being fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to what to perform it you got to believe that God can do what he said so stop you know stop I mean if you don't believe it I mean you coming to church in vain because you're not looking for a body change you you told you you're so in love with this one amen looking in the mirror amen getting the best of this and the best of that putting it on Amen but let's put on Christ hey man let's put on a Grace amen I'm worried about knocking this up this album ain't gonna perish your mother if you dress it up it's still gonna stick around praise God there ain't nothing wrong with looking a little nice but amen don't get a toe in love with it that you amen praise God you're so busy with the outside do you forgot about the inside amen the most important part amen is the inside praise God hallelujah so what happens though folks are so busy Amen on the outside today forgot about that there's a soul on the hillside Hallelujah thank you Jesus and with the Trump of God he said let's go back to Corinthians here God you got something in store for you if you're going to be caught up to meet him if you heard the voice that call you out revelation 18. come out of her my people amen you came out of those system man-made Creeds and dogwoods to come to not to a church to come to the word amen not to a man but to the word praise God I gotta I gotta close I didn't went too long no I'm all right okay it says 44 second verse again it is is also so also the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in corruption it is sown and Dishonored it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power I'm talking about uh the Redemption of your body it is sown in a natural body it is raised to what spiritual body this is there is a natural body and there is a what and so it is written the first man Adam was made or what living so the last man Adam was made or what quick in spirit amen how did that was not first which is what spiritual but that which is natural afterward that which is what the first man is of the word Earthly the second man is the what it is the Lord from where from heaven as is the Earthly earthy such are they also that are what earthy and as is the one Heavenly such a day also that I want I mean you know you know where you came from you were in Christ before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the finance in the world you are part of his body are you with me the body that God had in his mind before it was manifested on the Earth before Jesus Christ came in the flesh he was already in the mind of God are you with me so everything before man ever sinned for Adam and Eve ever sinned God already had a lamb slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world are you with me so God had a plan to save you a Salvation plan and God has something in store for you as far as a body change the Redemption of your body amen so don't get caught up the the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal so don't get caught up you if in this world you only have hope uh you'll be all men most miserable so the reason why we get miserable because this this world is disappointing family of disappoint you uh friends are disappoint you no matter how much you might love one another it'll become it comes time in life amen that this world Amen is full of trouble it's really disappointing because something's telling you is something better than this amen is a deep calling to the demon that something is better this whole body when it aches in pain it telling you amen it's something better are you with me and that's what God you got to you you got to prepare yourself for where you're going if you're going to heaven you got to you know a lot of times folk prepared himself for college preparing themselves for this and preparing themselves a job preparing themselves for that but are you preparing yourself for heaven the word of God actually is actually giving you amen what you need to get out of here and that's the purpose of the message of the hour is to equip you with all you need the resources and what you need the word that you need to change your body are you with me the opening of the seals an opening of the word what it is it's giving you body change and experience he said well I ain't changed yet because why through faith we were understand if you ain't got faith you can't understand if you don't want it you ain't gonna never you know you can't hungry for something amen accept God put that thirst in you and I hung in that desire he said no man can come to me except first With My Father which in heaven drawing there's got to be something to draw you to the cross draw you to Jesus Christ other than that you want whatever all and what all the other children want you want what all what the world won't you want because that's this is this is yours that's all you got to look forward to it's here and now and no matter how much to preacher preaching them how much her mama told no how much Daddy talk all you was looking forward to hearing now and you're selfish but if you believe in God if you believe in me if you believe in God amen then you know that his father in My Father's House of many majors but if you don't believe you I'm gonna tell you so brother what's so disappointing you can't make people believe it no matter how hard you pray for it takes God to touch them but you keep praying and keep believing but if God don't change them and touch them the devil's show gonna give them a spin he gonna wrap them up because they don't they you you you're not if you play the file your show won't get burned you play around with the Devil the devil show Gonna Get You you don't mess around with the devil thinking that you can get out of the mess when you get ready the devil can take you farther than you want to go and when he gets you out there amen you there's no way you can get back are you with me it's the grace of God that you're able to recover if you amen praise God recover it's just God's grace myself I I don't know why I did that but I got to stop I'm giving too much and going too many places but I want the part that I wanted to get to I didn't get to but the Redemption of our bodies we got something to look forward to brother sister this corruptable must put on the interruption in this model she'll put on their mortality you hear that all the time when somebody dying at a funeral but it's it's reality brother sister it's something it's real it's something that we as Christians look forward to but it's not exciting until it gets really real to us don't wait to death come your way and you get excited while you can enjoy God now and all the weapons and the beatings the devil take you through all the worrying all the frustration and all life turmoil and you can see him oh yeah why didn't I just why couldn't I understand why did I just trust God I could have been happy all my life but I I I I failed to really uh receive what God had given me I waited till now and I'm dying and I'm going and now I'm looking forward to uh going to to be with Jesus but I I could have enjoyed life but now I missed out on a lot of opportunities you know I I don't know his brother Ernie somebody said person got into heaven and all they did was they got their you know it was just them but all the blessings that they could should have had and could have had they didn't have none of those you know what I'm saying the only thing they did is they make it made it in but but all the blessings that they could enjoy all the riches all the glory that God wanted to give they had to struggle through life just badly badly made it not knowing what was available to them it's just like a person so rich had so much billions and billions of dollars but never spend a penny then when did on the death bed to realize I should have used some of those resources and enjoy some of that and that's what Christians do they wait until it's too late the spiritual blessings now I'm not talking about natural blessing all the spiritual blessings that God has provided for us sometimes we wait too late to really enjoy all the spiritual benefits and the spiritual blessings because we're too busy worrying and fretting ourselves about different things and he said don't practice them he told y'all things gonna work till you're good but you still be friends still be worried instead of just enjoying enjoying what God has given you the Holy Ghost enjoying the spirit of God just enjoying just feasting and enjoying the spirit of God that's what we want God bless you let us down I tell you when it's all over somebody said if I only knew it's just like when you got saved if you only knew how good God was you wouldn't never spent one minute serving the devil you wouldn't have spent one minute of your life serving the devil but you didn't know it a lot of folks as Christians go find out that God had so many blessings for him so many blessings but they couldn't enjoy because the devil's so kind of beating them up and this and that and all kind of stuff you tell that devil get behind me I'm enjoying myself I'm on my way to heaven I'm enjoying my trip praise God you know Jesus was sleeping no matter how the wind blew and no matter how to ship you know what's beating up Jesus was sleep the disciples because he knew he couldn't go before his time isn't that right and the devil can't do you know harm he might Bluff you Bluff you with this and Bluff you with that but the Devil is a bluff he can't do nothing let God allowed isn't that right and if a god alive God got a purpose and a reason why are you whooping so you if you know the devil and Jesus will sleep and then and the disciples said woke him up said Master count not that we perish you don't leave on perish I got to go to the cross he knew him and he had to go to the cross he knew the ship couldn't change are you up there so he could so he could rest I'm going to the other side the devil's upset are you with me and when you know he said go tell that fox wow ain't yet what's up man what you gonna do to me tell that fox y'all understand what I'm saying praise God if God allows something it's gonna work till you're good that's why you allowed it for your good Ness not oh look what the devil's doing to me in the deviling the devil is he went to you good amen the cursing was a blessing
