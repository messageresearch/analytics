[25:59] the book of first kings
[26:03] 18.
[26:06] first kings 18.
[26:13] god is good amen somebody said i love
[26:17] the lord because he heard my cry
[26:22] first kings 18 and 21.
[26:28] and elijah came unto all the people
[26:32] and said how
[26:36] long haunt ye between two opinions
[26:40] if the lord be god follow him
[26:44] but if they'll then follow him
[26:47] and the people asking him not
[26:50] a word may god bless the reader's word
[26:54] maybe see
[26:58] the people answered him not a word the
[27:01] 39th
[27:02] verse here same chapter
[27:10] let's just start at the 37th verse
[27:13] 37 hear me o lord
[27:18] hear me and
[27:22] this people may know that thou art
[27:25] the lord god and the thou has
[27:28] turned their hearts back again
[27:34] then the fire of the lord fell
[27:38] and consumed the burnt sacrifices in the
[27:41] wood
[27:42] and the stone and the dust
[27:46] and licked up the water that was in the
[27:49] trenches
[27:51] and when all the people saw it they fell
[27:55] on their faces and they said the lord
[28:00] he is god the lord
[28:03] he is god the lord he's god amen
[28:10] now we was
[28:14] to talk to you this morning about
[28:17] turning our hearts
[28:21] back again
[28:24] turning your hearts back again
[28:27] our hearts back again amen
[28:34] israel a little theme this morning a
[28:38] sub-topic this morning is how long will
[28:42] you hawk
[28:44] between two opinions
[28:48] how long will you hawk between
[28:51] two opinions
[28:56] see israel was in a backslidden state
[29:02] but in that backsling state
[29:07] they wanted to take heave to the
[29:10] prophets
[29:13] and worshipping the law
[29:16] but at the same time they wanted to
[29:20] please
[29:20] jezebel by worshiping baal
[29:26] are you with me so they had two
[29:29] options they wanted to worship the lord
[29:31] because of the prophets
[29:34] they wanted to worship baal because of
[29:38] jezebel
[29:42] but elijah came on the scene
[29:45] with the word from the lord
[29:50] elijah thought that the status of israel
[29:53] was
[29:55] the prophet of baal was 400 and so
[30:01] but he was standing by himself he was
[30:04] alone
[30:07] because the status of israel
[30:13] we understand that once
[30:16] jeroboam and real born had the conflict
[30:21] jeroboam in israel built the golden calf
[30:26] to keep the people from going back to
[30:28] worship the lord
[30:32] and the people worship the golden calf
[30:35] as they did when they were in the
[30:37] wilderness
[30:39] when they had aaron to build the golden
[30:41] caps that these be our god
[30:43] this is our god that brought us out of
[30:45] egypt
[30:46] so oftentimes that there was then so is
[30:49] it now
[30:52] i was talking to the young people on
[30:54] tuesday and i said
[30:57] how you treat god now is how you would
[31:00] have treated him if you were back there
[31:02] in that day
[31:05] how you worship the lord now if you were
[31:08] in the days of moses you would do the
[31:10] same thing
[31:11] if you were in the days of noah you
[31:13] would do the same thing
[31:17] you will be no different if god does not
[31:20] mean
[31:20] much to you now he wouldn't mean much to
[31:23] you then
[31:25] if you serve god half
[31:28] halfway and you know like you wanna
[31:32] and do like you wanna live like you
[31:34] wanna
[31:36] uh how hawk you between
[31:39] how long will you hawk between two
[31:41] opinions
[31:42] can you make up your mind you're going
[31:45] to serve the lord
[31:47] or not so elijah was giving the people
[31:51] an
[31:51] option i want you to consider
[31:56] what you're going to do are you going to
[31:59] serve your lord
[32:01] or are you going to serve baal
[32:05] and elijah had uh uh
[32:09] i i wanted to demonstrate to you amen
[32:12] which god is real and which god is the
[32:15] living god which god
[32:17] that has the power
[32:20] i need sometimes we every night dead
[32:24] amen the people need to see that god
[32:27] is the lord
[32:31] that god is the lord
[32:35] the god that you're serving amen he is
[32:38] the true
[32:39] and living god so there was a challenge
[32:43] of
[32:44] we call it the calm or showdown
[32:48] it was all about who was gonna
[32:52] win the hearts of the people
[32:56] see sometimes we're backslidden in our
[32:58] hearts
[33:00] and we're actually watching with our own
[33:02] secret uh
[33:04] uh uh uh our own bail worship
[33:08] and we'll are heating taking heat to
[33:11] jezebel
[33:12] teaching so jezebel doctrine
[33:16] now who is the jezebel and who is the
[33:19] baal
[33:20] the god that we bowed on in worship and
[33:23] at the same time
[33:25] we want to please the god in that of the
[33:28] prophets
[33:31] we want the lord and we want to
[33:35] jezebel god we don't want to just give
[33:38] up
[33:38] god we want both
[33:43] often times we look and people want to
[33:47] be
[33:48] in the night club and they want to party
[33:51] and they want to do this and that the
[33:53] pledges of this life
[33:56] they want to have the entertainment
[34:00] i believe that we are so much stuck on
[34:03] entertainment
[34:04] and pledges of this life till we put god
[34:08] on the back burner he's not
[34:10] really amen
[34:13] first in our lives we just saw
[34:16] uh talk about him we're just doing
[34:19] enough for
[34:20] the that say that god you first
[34:23] see you know sometimes we have to amen
[34:26] put away
[34:27] amen the images of baal and the things
[34:29] of this world
[34:30] see uh he said why hulk how long will
[34:34] you hawk between
[34:35] two opinions make up your mind who you
[34:39] gonna
[34:39] serve are you with me
[34:44] but the people had a problem because
[34:46] they thought amen i'm getting along
[34:49] fine because i i i got
[34:53] bailed and i i i i got both
[34:58] and people in the church
[35:02] they think they can have it both ways
[35:06] i think i can do what i want to do
[35:10] and i think that i can do what the lord
[35:13] want me to do
[35:16] brother and sister
[35:19] let me let me look at uh jeremiah for a
[35:23] minute jeremiah 2
[35:26] and hopefully we're not preaching this
[35:28] morning so
[35:29] hopefully we just talk to you a little
[35:31] bit amen
[35:34] our hearts need to be turned we need to
[35:36] realize that
[35:38] uh that
[35:43] every man thinks that he's right in his
[35:45] own eyes
[35:48] in his own eyes he thinks he's all right
[35:52] but god is not looking at what you think
[35:55] about it
[35:57] because he said your thoughts are not my
[35:59] thoughts
[36:00] the way you think i don't think like
[36:02] that
[36:04] so don't tell me how you think cause god
[36:06] is not concerning how you what you think
[36:09] about it
[36:11] because your thoughts don't matter with
[36:13] god
[36:15] are you with me because in
[36:19] our hearts amen we can't even trust our
[36:23] own heart
[36:25] because jeremiah said the heart is
[36:26] deceitful and desperately wicked
[36:29] who can know it
[36:32] amen so god we must amen
[36:36] allow god to change just so hard of mine
[36:41] he said i'll give you a new spirit and
[36:44] i'll give you a new heart
[36:46] see because your heart ain't good enough
[36:49] for god
[36:50] so god has to give you a new heart and a
[36:52] new spirit

[37:06] that our hearts might be turned again
[37:10] turn back to god why you have an
[37:14] opportunity

[37:22] children
[37:23] back into the faith of the apostolic
[37:25] fathers
[37:27] are you with me in other words to turn
[37:30] you back
[37:31] amen to the what the word of god says
[37:34] that man should not live by bread alone
[37:37] but by every word
[37:38] that proceeded out of the mouth of god
[37:42] the purpose of the word amen that come
[37:45] in this uh the book being opened is to
[37:48] show you
[37:49] the need of you and i amen living by
[37:52] every word that proceeded out of the
[37:54] mouth of god
[37:55] it meant that god wants you amen to have
[37:58] the preeminence in our lives
[38:00] god wants to have our all in all
[38:04] leave it god he don't want you
[38:08] ain't meant to uh be in the world and in
[38:12] the church at the same time
[38:14] trying to amen let me see what jeremiah
[38:16] says about it
[38:18] he says go
[38:21] and cry excuse me
[38:26] jeremiah 2 and 11.
[38:31] he said has a nation as an
[38:35] has a nation changed their gods
[38:40] which yet are no gods
[38:44] but my people have changed their what
[38:48] see see what happens is
[38:52] we have changed the glory what
[38:55] my glory amen he says change my glory
[38:59] for that which
[39:00] do not what it won't prompt
[39:04] my glory amen for that which does not
[39:07] profit
[39:08] you know everybody wants to be glorified
[39:12] and
[39:12] amen and they're changing god's glory
[39:16] for that which was not possible amen
[39:20] that's the stuff that people are caught
[39:23] up in
[39:24] and the stuff that they're putting in
[39:26] front of god
[39:28] amen it won't profit it amen i don't
[39:31] care how
[39:32] how how much your house calls and what
[39:34] kind of
[39:35] car you drive i don't care what kind of
[39:38] money you're making
[39:39] seems like something wrong with the
[39:41] minds of man
[39:44] their heart is not all with god amen
[39:47] they can't get enough of amen this kind
[39:50] of glory that
[39:51] the world is offering them some type of
[39:54] uh image that they'll want to put up
[39:56] amen
[39:57] and they were caught up in baal worship
[39:59] amen
[40:00] these are this thing are caught up even
[40:03] in
[40:04] images and glory for man and they're
[40:07] trying
[40:07] they meant to have a false and a
[40:09] counterfeit type of glory
[40:13] we're looking for prestige and image and
[40:16] amen
[40:16] glory for man what are we trying to
[40:18] achieve where are we going
[40:22] what do we want out of life who are you
[40:24] trying to please
[40:27] who do you want to look up to you what
[40:29] you're trying to be
[40:30] what are you seeking after
[40:33] the bible says seek you first the
[40:37] kingdom of god
[40:39] and here's what i i believe
[40:42] amen amen the prophet of god said people
[40:45] are trying to do god a service
[40:48] without it being his will
[40:52] we're so stuck on amen i'm doing
[40:54] something for god you cannot serve god
[40:57] and mammal
[40:59] amen why hawk you between
[41:03] that we're in an age where the church
[41:06] has become
[41:07] lukewarm it's neither hot nor cold
[41:11] amen he said lukewarm i spew you out of
[41:14] my mouth
[41:15] that is the condition of leo seal and
[41:18] that is the condition of most people's
[41:19] lives
[41:21] they're not hot they're not cold they
[41:24] they want to serve
[41:25] bail and they want to serve god
[41:29] but he said why how long will you heart
[41:33] between two opinions make up your mind
[41:37] he says he said i would that you were
[41:39] hot or cold
[41:41] because lukewarm i'll spew you out of my
[41:44] mouth
[41:44] don't talk about amen all of this
[41:47] nonsense
[41:48] it's what's wrong with you that your
[41:51] hearts are not
[41:52] turned

[41:59] elijah said now now i i i want to help
[42:03] y'all

[42:39] amen because they they had a problem
[42:42] and the problem was i'm all right
[42:46] i ain't got the answer you elijah

[43:47] church
[43:52] amen not because you come in the
[43:53] building are you in the church
[43:57] but whether you're in the word or not
[43:58] that's your decision as an
[44:00] individual not at the group
[44:03] it's not collected it's not what amen
[44:06] what you see others do that you make up
[44:08] your mind
[44:09] it's you and the lord

[44:44] me
[44:44] in my house i'm going to serve the law
[44:49] amen joshua was faced with the people
[44:52] hawking between two opinions but he came
[44:55] to
[44:56] the place where amen he made a decision
[44:59] y'all got to choose you this day whom
[45:02] you're gonna

[45:42] away from the lord

[1:04:24] jesus
[1:04:25] and jesus said go sell all you have and
[1:04:28] give them to the poor
[1:04:29] and come and follow me he turned on
