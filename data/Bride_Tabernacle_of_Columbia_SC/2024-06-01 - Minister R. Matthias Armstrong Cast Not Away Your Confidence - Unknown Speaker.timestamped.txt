[48:21] amen you may be
[48:23] seated man before I I you know brother
[48:26] erest called me I was kind of praying
[48:28] and seeking God on which direction to go
[48:30] on tonight and I was tossed back and
[48:33] forth between two areas uh and uh
[48:37] Wednesday night bible study my my dad he
[48:40] he don't know that he was hitting on so
[48:41] much of what God was dealing with me on
[48:44] and he referenced a quote from the
[48:45] prophet and right when I heard that
[48:47] quote uh I knew that was confirmation uh
[48:50] because I'm I'm I'm new at this so I can
[48:52] only preach what come from the heart all
[48:54] right I don't know a lot I'm not deep
[48:56] it's simple but I I'm learning brother
[48:59] is to stay in my Lane till God tells me
[49:01] to turn on the signal amen I'm going
[49:04] stay right where he has me but this this
[49:07] topic here Hebrews 10:35 is is a very
[49:10] familiar passage of scripture if you
[49:12] Google uh scriptures for encouragement
[49:14] it would probably take you to this
[49:17] passage it's one I've heard a lot of
[49:19] times in my life and it's a very
[49:21] familiar passage of scripture and it's
[49:22] definitely one that you should shout
[49:24] about but it's it's a scripture that
[49:27] holds a lot of weight and in order for
[49:31] you to really catch the Revelation
[49:33] behind this you've got to understand the
[49:35] force that's driving the weight behind
[49:37] this passage of
[49:39] scripture uh we we know the theme of
[49:42] Hebrews is is better you know it talks
[49:45] about being faithful it talks about how
[49:48] God is better than the Angels how he
[49:50] does no longer offers a blood sacrifice
[49:52] he's better than that but if you read
[49:55] this passage of scripture it's like okay
[49:57] we got to do better than cast out away
[49:58] your confidence but you've got to
[50:00] understand who the writer is talking to
[50:02] In this passage of scripture he's not
[50:04] talking to
[50:05] Sinners he's not talking to people who
[50:07] are Sinking Deep in sin and far from the
[50:10] peaceful Shore he is talking to
[50:13] Believers people who believe in God
[50:17] people who know that God is real God is
[50:20] true and he's telling them cast not away
[50:23] your confidence
[50:27] so these and I think in order to
[50:30] understand that you you you can identify
[50:32] with the scripture because I believe we
[50:34] all in here are believers right so if
[50:37] you've never been in a situation to
[50:39] where you've been
[50:41] TI know in my walk with Christ there are
[50:44] times where I just need a little bit
[50:47] more
[50:48] energy Lord you know if you you lifting
[50:51] weights I work out from time to time and
[50:54] they give you a rep a 12 or 10 and when
[50:57] you start out you start out strong on
[50:59] rep one rep two rep three but once you
[51:02] get to about eight or nine you tend to
[51:04] get tired something starts to happen and
[51:07] you need a little bit more energy to
[51:09] push you through and these are what
[51:11] these people are experiencing here in
[51:13] Hebrews chapter 10 they are experiencing
[51:16] a moment in their life to where they are
[51:20] tired
[51:22] okay they are exhausted they are
[51:25] completely to the point to where they
[51:28] need some strength now we live in a
[51:30] world of social media church to where if
[51:32] we need some uh support or if we need
[51:35] some encouragement we can go to Google
[51:37] we can look up something very quickly we
[51:39] can go to social
[51:41] media but these are letters that are
[51:43] being written okay and by the time this
[51:47] letter gets to them they're to the point
[51:48] that they are ready to throw in the tire
[51:51] they are spiritually exhausted they are
[51:53] people who says Lord I know what your
[51:56] promis
[51:57] is I know you're
[51:59] real I know that you are faithful oh
[52:02] yeah but what is taking so
[52:05] long see it's easy to have faith in God
[52:08] church when he answers your prayer
[52:11] tonight when he answers your prayer
[52:13] tomorrow maybe next week but where are
[52:16] you when it's 5 years down the
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:20] road when it's two to 5 years from now
[52:23] you get to a point to where they are
[52:26] what is taking so
[52:29] long Lord and if we've been
[52:31] honest we get like that sometime in my
[52:33] walk with Christ am I talking to real
[52:35] people out there or are you some of
[52:37] those people that don't never get tired
[52:38] everything going good for
[52:42] you we find oursel or these people found
[52:45] their s in the space to where they
[52:47] started asking themselves questions they
[52:50] start making
[52:51] declarations I'm not waiting no more
[52:54] forget this thing called faith you've
[52:56] been talking
[52:58] about I'm just going to do it
[53:00] myself Lord because I'm tired of
[53:04] waiting I am spiritually exhausted now
[53:07] here let me give you some symptoms of
[53:08] what spiritual
[53:10] exhaustion uh causes one is idolatry oh
[53:13] yeah seeking satisfaction in things that
[53:16] don't ultimately satisfy such as alcohol
[53:18] or partying and things like that another
[53:22] uh uh symptom of spiritual exhaustion or
[53:26] being spiritually tired is busyness come
[53:30] on becoming consumed with doing and not
[53:33] slowing down enough to sense God's
[53:36] presence you see that today people so
[53:38] worried about what other people doing
[53:40] trying to put people in put people out
[53:42] trying to label people when they're
[53:43] missing what God is trying to do in
[53:45] their life so busy I think about Martha
[53:48] she was busy doing the wrong thing she
[53:51] forgot the very person she was serving
[53:53] was right there in her house amen
[53:57] busy doing something that was good and
[53:59] she was missing the essential thing that
[54:01] she
[54:02] needed that's right one example or or or
[54:07] symptom of of spiritual fatigue or
[54:09] burnout is misalignment with God's
[54:12] [Music]
[54:14] purpose feeling like you you're doing
[54:16] the right thing but you're completely
[54:18] out of the will of
[54:20] God you think about Saul people think
[54:23] look at Saul the spirit of the Lord left
[54:25] him and isolated from God but here's the
[54:28] thing when it triggered when God was
[54:30] disappointed when Saul disobeyed Saul
[54:32] still won the
[54:34] war he still
[54:38] W that will fire you and still let you
[54:41] keep your job out of the will of
[54:44] God sometimes we think just because
[54:46] we're applying the right practices and
[54:48] doing the right things and we're
[54:49] budgeting right and we got money in the
[54:50] bank that we're in the will of God
[54:54] right on
[54:59] we we we find ourselves as I read this
[55:02] pastor the scripture Church in the same
[55:04] situation this church was and the writer
[55:05] is telling them don't throw away your
[55:07] confidence as a believer in Christ we
[55:08] get to the point to where we have to
[55:10] know how to navigate through those
[55:12] situations to where we feel like we are
[55:14] spiritually drained and tired when
[55:17] you've been praying for
[55:19] God lord I come to the altar I know you
[55:22] can make a
[55:23] way but at this point I'm tired of
[55:25] singing I'm no longer No Ways
[55:29] Tired what happens when you've been
[55:31] singing that song for five years you're
[55:33] ready to get to Lord You're a way maker
[55:34] you're ready to get to Lord I've seen
[55:36] you
[55:37] move you're ready to get to the next
[55:40] song in your
[55:43] life you've been quoting that
[55:46] scripture uh weeping may endure for
[55:48] night but joy come in the morning and
[55:50] you're wondering Lord when is my morning
[55:52] going to show up it's been 5 years later
[55:54] I'm waiting for the sun to break amen
[55:57] amen I said we're not talking about
[55:59] cases where God shows up right then the
[56:01] there but when you go 6 10 years and
[56:04] you've been praying for it this is where
[56:07] this writer finds them he says don't
[56:09] throw away your
[56:12] confidence they are in a situation to
[56:15] where the church remember these are
[56:17] believers these are Christians these are
[56:19] people who know God is real but he is
[56:22] telling them don't throw away your
[56:25] confidence amen amen amen amen now he
[56:30] says the words Cast Away and and and I I
[56:32] kind of did some digging into those
[56:33] words cast not away if we can put that
[56:36] scripture back up there says the words
[56:38] cast not away they are taken from the
[56:40] Greek word that that is pronounced Oppo
[56:44] Balo which is a compound of words APO
[56:48] and Balo the words cast not away the
[56:50] word Oppo means away and the word ball
[56:52] means to throw something such as a ball
[56:55] rock or some other object when these two
[56:58] words are compounded together the new
[57:01] word means to throw away or to
[57:04] discard or to get rid of something no
[57:08] longer
[57:09] desired needed or
[57:13] wanted we see this in Mark 10: 50 blind
[57:17] B it says as he was casting away His
[57:20] Garment Rose and came to Jesus this is
[57:23] the same uh word that is used now when
[57:25] blind marus got up the reason why he
[57:27] Cast Away His Garment was because it was
[57:30] holding him
[57:32] back it was preventing him from getting
[57:35] to Jesus so the writer is telling him
[57:38] that confidence you got don't discard it
[57:40] like it's the thing that is holding you
[57:42] back from God's
[57:45] promise Lord this is why Hebrews is
[57:47] telling he warns the believer cast not
[57:50] away your confidence because the words
[57:52] cast not away are from the word alabalo
[57:54] the verse suggests that they were so
[57:56] tired and frustrated with waiting for
[57:59] God's promise to come to pass that they
[58:02] was tempted to just throw this whole
[58:03] Faith thing
[58:05] away maybe my waiting is the thing
[58:07] that's holding me back from getting what
[58:09] I
[58:11] need so you have to you have to ask
[58:14] yourself this question how did these
[58:15] this church get to this point to where
[58:19] they were tired yeah the writer answers
[58:22] this question in the next passage of
[58:23] scripture I won't be before you long
[58:25] amen I just want to Brak break down a
[58:26] few points he says here in verse
[58:30] 36 he says for what ye have need of
[58:35] patience
[58:37] right so we understand from this this is
[58:39] a Time
[58:41] issue this is an issue that is related
[58:43] to them waiting for a remember these are
[58:46] believers these are people who believe
[58:49] in God but time has taken its toll on
[58:52] their faith so they are to the point to
[58:54] where they're saying this faith thing
[58:56] maybe it is the thing that is holding me
[58:59] back brother
[59:01] Ernest so they're thinking maybe I
[59:04] should just discard it and cast it
[59:07] away one of the thing the hardest things
[59:09] that God asks us to do sometime and that
[59:11] is to
[59:14] wait waiting does several things number
[59:17] one it exposes our
[59:20] unbelief it reveals our
[59:23] bitterness it amplifies our pain pain it
[59:27] magnifies our
[59:30] weaknesses you think about it you go to
[59:32] the emergency room where you break your
[59:33] leg or
[59:35] something your first response is I got
[59:37] to go to some place that can help
[59:39] me so that first response is what the
[59:41] emergency room you get there you in pain
[59:44] you know this is the place that can fix
[59:46] my
[59:48] problem but you get there and you sign
[59:51] in and they tell you to do what wait
[59:53] wait right while you're waiting
[59:56] guess what you're doing you looking at
[59:58] everybody else go in everybody else who
[1:00:01] got sniffles and and don't look like
[1:00:03] they're in pain because your leg is
[1:00:05] broke what do you start then getting mad
[1:00:08] getting frustrated oh spiritually you've
[1:00:11] been praying to God for things in your
[1:00:13] life and it seemed like everybody else
[1:00:15] is getting their prayers answered but
[1:00:18] yours then you start to have thoughts
[1:00:20] with sister so and so she don't even go
[1:00:22] to church every day I do why she got a
[1:00:24] car and I've been praying for one for 5
[1:00:26] years
[1:00:28] on brother so and so is not living right
[1:00:31] he got healed and I've been praying for
[1:00:33] my healing and I ain't got it
[1:00:37] yet everybody else is getting their
[1:00:40] blessing but my leg is still
[1:00:43] broke I'm in
[1:00:45] pain then you start having questions you
[1:00:48] start asking I call them the five W's
[1:00:51] you start implementing this in your
[1:00:53] verbiage from the fruit of your lips
[1:00:55] when where why
[1:00:58] what dialogue that causes you to start
[1:01:01] doubting and and and having disbelief he
[1:01:04] is telling them don't do that you have
[1:01:07] need of what
[1:01:11] patience amen
[1:01:14] amen one of the most uh if you go to
[1:01:17] read the about the prophet habach the
[1:01:19] message in his life is one word and that
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:22] weight he says in our backup to 1 and
[1:01:25] two he says oh Lord how long shall I
[1:01:28] cry and thou will not hear even to cry
[1:01:32] out unto thee of violence and thou will
[1:01:34] not save he's asking Lord how much
[1:01:37] longer do I have to wait oh this is the
[1:01:40] prophet he's telling this to God how
[1:01:42] much longer I'm tired of
[1:01:45] waiting wait on the Lord what happens
[1:01:48] when you've been singing that for 5
[1:01:49] years and thing you've been promising go
[1:01:51] that God's promises are yay and amen and
[1:01:54] you don't see it manifested yet Lord I
[1:01:56] know you're a good God but I don't feel
[1:01:58] good right
[1:02:00] now Lord thank you Jesus over and over
[1:02:03] we see in the Bible it's about 116 times
[1:02:05] where the Bible tells us to wait to wait
[1:02:08] to wait to
[1:02:11] wait amen but we should ask oursel that
[1:02:13] this question Church what does it mean
[1:02:15] to wait on the
[1:02:16] Lord what does that mean what is what
[1:02:19] does that look like cuz this is what
[1:02:21] he's telling them in the Hebrews he's
[1:02:24] telling them ye have need of patience
[1:02:28] waited on the Lord biblically said means
[1:02:30] this to not go outside of God to resolve
[1:02:33] your
[1:02:36] issue that's it when you ask God for
[1:02:39] something you wait until he shows
[1:02:44] up that's all waiting is don't go
[1:02:47] outside his will to accomplish what you
[1:02:50] want amen not taking matters in your own
[1:02:54] hand that's what happens when when you
[1:02:56] get fatigued you just start doing
[1:02:58] stuff trying
[1:03:01] stuff because maybe this Faith thing is
[1:03:04] the thing that is holding me back but
[1:03:07] the writer tells them don't throw away
[1:03:10] your
[1:03:12] confidence it is the recompense of your
[1:03:14] reward amen don't stop declaring who God
[1:03:18] is what he
[1:03:22] is Lamentations 3 and 25 we don't have
[1:03:25] to turn there for the second time he
[1:03:26] said the Lord is good unto them that
[1:03:29] wait on him the Lord is good unto them
[1:03:32] that wait on
[1:03:35] him to the soul that seeketh him now
[1:03:38] seeketh is an
[1:03:40] action the Lord is good unto them that
[1:03:43] wait on him now here's what I need you
[1:03:45] to do I need you to keep seeking me I
[1:03:47] need you to keep coming to church I need
[1:03:50] you to keep worshiping I need you to
[1:03:51] keep keep keep keep keep seeking me
[1:03:54] until I show up
[1:03:58] that's the action there's a requirement
[1:04:00] there I'm just going to sit here and I'm
[1:04:01] just going to wait no you need to be
[1:04:03] doing
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:07] something amen praise the Lord when we
[1:04:11] go if we go back and read James 5: 7-13
[1:04:14] it is a passage of scripture where James
[1:04:16] is saying during your waiting don't
[1:04:18] complain all right just go back and read
[1:04:20] it we won't go there for the S time but
[1:04:22] he's telling them when you're going
[1:04:23] through your season of weit uh do not
[1:04:29] complain here's why because doubt and
[1:04:33] complaining and Disobedience results in
[1:04:35] two things regarding your promise that
[1:04:37] is delay and
[1:04:40] denial when you start
[1:04:42] complaining why they got this and I
[1:04:44] ain't got it yet Lord I've been praying
[1:04:46] sister so and so brother so and so you
[1:04:48] start to complain that a fruit of your
[1:04:50] lips are not pleasing to
[1:04:54] God hallelujah
[1:04:56] thank you
[1:04:58] Jesus what are some signs of delay when
[1:05:01] you're complaining instead of
[1:05:04] worshiping you know Abraham had to wait
[1:05:07] 25 years for his promise but his promise
[1:05:11] was delayed because he got tired and it
[1:05:13] was taking too
[1:05:15] long what did he do
[1:05:17] ishmail how many of us right now we look
[1:05:20] back how many ishs in our lives have we
[1:05:22] created because it took too long so I'm
[1:05:25] going go do it
[1:05:27] myself Lord this waiting thing maybe the
[1:05:29] Lord just wants me to move faith without
[1:05:32] works is dead so I mean I'm going go do
[1:05:38] something here's another part if we can
[1:05:40] go back to Hebrews chapter
[1:05:43] 10:35 what exactly is God doing while we
[1:05:47] wait this this thing this thing caught
[1:05:50] me church and it was an eye opener for
[1:05:53] me if we go back to go to verse 36 says
[1:05:57] for ye have need of patience comma yeah
[1:06:00] here's the kicker after ye have done the
[1:06:05] will of God come on now now you might
[1:06:09] receive the
[1:06:10] promise now that middle piece the will
[1:06:13] of God sometimes we miss that we ask God
[1:06:15] for things not understanding God has a
[1:06:18] bigger plan at
[1:06:21] work so if I could sum that passage up
[1:06:25] five words it's not all about
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:33] you the reason you're waiting is God is
[1:06:37] trying to kill multiple birds with one
[1:06:40] stone okay I'mma answer your promise
[1:06:43] however I got some other things that I
[1:06:45] need to get
[1:06:46] accomplished I'mma develop you while you
[1:06:49] wait I'm going to accomplish some things
[1:06:52] the prayers
[1:06:53] answered but you got some I need to get
[1:06:56] done in your
[1:06:59] life let's let's go to we don't have to
[1:07:02] turn that but job 23 every every when
[1:07:04] you talk about God's will being done the
[1:07:06] purpose uh of God and the way the way he
[1:07:09] really does not care how we feel our
[1:07:11] comfort out all those things good story
[1:07:13] to look at is
[1:07:15] job job man no one righteous like job
[1:07:18] good job the one who said on his knees
[1:07:20] Lord uh uh the lord giveth and the lord
[1:07:22] taketh away job found himself
[1:07:26] in a place to where he was
[1:07:28] tired if you go to job 23: 8-9 job is
[1:07:32] saying I go forward and he's not there I
[1:07:36] go backwards Lord I need an answer I
[1:07:39] mean come on it's been 2
[1:07:42] years God I started out on fire
[1:07:45] declaring that you are good declaring
[1:07:48] you giveth and you taketh the way the
[1:07:49] naked I came into this world naked I I
[1:07:52] came in declaring that now I'm at a
[1:07:54] point to where I I'm just
[1:07:57] tired praise the Lord here's here's the
[1:08:00] thing we got to understand Church God's
[1:08:03] purpose and his will will always take
[1:08:06] priority over your timing your sense of
[1:08:09] urgency your
[1:08:12] comfort that is the tough thing to be
[1:08:15] able to
[1:08:16] digest because when we go to God for
[1:08:19] promises and we go to God for answers we
[1:08:22] we expect that God is supposed to just
[1:08:24] acknowledge what we want how we feel
[1:08:27] when God says I know the plans I have
[1:08:29] for you you don't even know what's good
[1:08:30] for
[1:08:34] you he knows the thoughts and the plans
[1:08:38] he has for you he knows what's best for
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:45] you his purpose and his will will always
[1:08:49] take priority over your timing your
[1:08:52] sense of urgency how much pain you're in
[1:08:55] that's right here's one of the tactic
[1:08:57] the enemy uses church so when we're
[1:09:00] going through our seasons of
[1:09:02] weight he wants us to forget God's
[1:09:04] sovereignty in it
[1:09:05] all what does that mean that means when
[1:09:09] you're in God's will and you're pressing
[1:09:11] your way and you're serving him his
[1:09:14] sovereignty means that if anything
[1:09:16] negative happens in your life it had to
[1:09:18] come to him
[1:09:21] first amen that means he allowed it that
[1:09:24] is why the Bible says in everything give
[1:09:26] thanks because if you allowed it Lord
[1:09:29] you must know what's about to be at the
[1:09:30] end of
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:34] us Bible says give thanks in everything
[1:09:38] Lord I don't know what the will is for
[1:09:39] my life that's one of them in everything
[1:09:42] give thanks for this is the will of God
[1:09:44] in Christ Jesus what concerning you if
[1:09:47] you don't know the will of your life
[1:09:49] that's one of them give thanks and
[1:09:50] everything I just gave you that all
[1:09:53] right so by placing word words like hope
[1:09:57] chance what people going to say those
[1:09:59] five W's the devil wants us to forget
[1:10:01] God's sovereignty he wants us to focus
[1:10:04] on who what when I'm going to get it
[1:10:08] where I'm going to get it where it's
[1:10:09] going to happen why I ain't got it
[1:10:11] yet and he wants you to forget about God
[1:10:15] allowed it and if you're in God's will
[1:10:18] nothing negative in your life gets to
[1:10:21] you before he checks it first come on
[1:10:24] that is the thing job forgot on now in
[1:10:27] his moment of of of tiredness he forgot
[1:10:29] if God allowed it he's going to bring me
[1:10:31] through
[1:10:33] it oh yes Prophet God said in the
[1:10:35] message what does it take to make a
[1:10:37] Christian Life all right he says there
[1:10:40] isn't enough power in all of hell not
[1:10:43] that can defeat the purpose of God says
[1:10:47] God would do it anyhow amen let's give
[1:10:49] the Lord a hand clap of Praise I'm about
[1:10:52] done here
[1:10:53] amen if I can get a little bit more uh
[1:10:55] volume in the monitors please
[1:10:58] amen so I want to give an example here
[1:11:00] um I man that's perfect I want to give
[1:11:02] an example here of Joseph you think
[1:11:04] about Joseph's
[1:11:05] situation and let's go to amen Psalms
[1:11:09] chapter
[1:11:14] 105 we start at verse 17 amen he says he
[1:11:18] sent a man before them even Joseph who
[1:11:21] was sold for a servant Verse 18 says
[1:11:24] whose feet
[1:11:25] they hurt with feathers he was laid in
[1:11:28] Iron verse 19 says until the time that
[1:11:31] his word came the word of the Lord did
[1:11:34] what tried him then the king sent and
[1:11:38] loosed him even the ruler of the people
[1:11:41] and let him go he made him Lord of all
[1:11:43] his house and ruler of all his substance
[1:11:46] then verse 22 says to bind his
[1:11:48] princesses at his pleasure and to teach
[1:11:50] his Senators wisdom and I want to go to
[1:11:53] Genesis chter 45 uh we start at verse uh
[1:12:03] 7 everybody good amen amen verse 7
[1:12:08] reads says and God sent me before you to
[1:12:11] preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:12:15] and to save your lives by a great
[1:12:18] Deliverance now we all know the story of
[1:12:21] Joseph what he went through in his life
[1:12:23] but when as I reading this pastor
[1:12:25] scripture there's one word that stood
[1:12:26] out to me and that is the word
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] sent now God just didn't send Joseph
[1:12:33] from point A to point
[1:12:36] B there were multiple
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:39] stops before he gets to this point now
[1:12:44] how did God send him let's let's break
[1:12:46] this down a little bit uhuh he's
[1:12:48] betrayed by his brothers right sold to
[1:12:52] the Israelites
[1:12:53] yeah go goes to Piper's house now here's
[1:12:57] the thing you got to catch in this
[1:13:00] moment Joseph was praying to get go back
[1:13:03] home he you think he was okay being
[1:13:06] taken away from his family the Bible
[1:13:09] says in Genesis the next chapter it says
[1:13:11] the Lord was with Joseph when Piper
[1:13:14] comes to Joseph and accuses him he says
[1:13:17] I don't want to offend God it ain't
[1:13:20] about you I don't want to sin against
[1:13:21] God so that means in this moment he had
[1:13:24] a relationship that's right you don't
[1:13:27] have a relationship with God just by
[1:13:28] being Idol and just waiting that's right
[1:13:30] not doing anything Joseph had a
[1:13:34] relationship then he sold he's going to
[1:13:36] jail then he's doing all these things my
[1:13:39] point is this the word sent if we can
[1:13:42] put that back up there all it involves
[1:13:45] is negative things in his
[1:13:47] life nothing positive the way God sent
[1:13:50] him and accomplished his purpose was all
[1:13:52] bad things that Joseph probably felt was
[1:13:55] prolonging his
[1:13:58] promise that's right now church God is
[1:14:02] doing something bigger than you sir and
[1:14:05] that is the piece the devil tries to get
[1:14:07] us to to to misunderstand or forget that
[1:14:10] it ain't about you if his if you're in
[1:14:12] the palm of his of his hand that means
[1:14:15] he has complete control from point A to
[1:14:18] point B so whatever negative that's in
[1:14:20] your life God has aligned it for his
[1:14:24] purpose so Joseph finds himself he says
[1:14:27] God sent me before you to preserve I see
[1:14:31] what why I went through that I
[1:14:33] understand now that Not only was God
[1:14:36] fulfilling his purpose he was molding
[1:14:39] Joseph that's right he was building
[1:14:41] Joseph I'm going to kill multiple Birds
[1:14:43] Joseph I heard your prayer the first
[1:14:45] time when you asked to be delivered but
[1:14:46] in this moment I got a bigger plan for
[1:14:49] you that you know nothing about so while
[1:14:51] I accomplish that I'm going to mold you
[1:14:53] I'm going to cut off the B add pieces
[1:14:56] that way when you
[1:14:58] arrive my will can be accomplished
[1:15:01] because it ain't about you Joseph it's
[1:15:03] about my glory and what my will is for
[1:15:06] your
[1:15:09] life that's what it's about we want God
[1:15:12] to control every aspect of our life but
[1:15:14] we want to rush
[1:15:16] things we want to speed God up lord it's
[1:15:18] not happening and we prolong the will of
[1:15:21] God for our life because we try to do
[1:15:23] things on our own yeah so true Y and
[1:15:26] that's why the writer tells them don't
[1:15:29] throw away your confidence amen I know
[1:15:33] you're tired uhhuh I know you're asking
[1:15:35] these questions but the confidence you
[1:15:37] got don't throw it away amen because
[1:15:41] it's recompense for your reward if we
[1:15:43] can go back to Genesis um Hebrews
[1:15:46] 10:36 everybody good amen
[1:15:51] amen that's what gave Joseph the ability
[1:15:53] to endure
[1:15:55] through this moment of these moments in
[1:15:57] his life what was his relationship with
[1:15:59] God yeah he worshiped he worked yeah the
[1:16:03] gift that God gave him he did just sit
[1:16:05] idle that is what's able to get you
[1:16:08] through the Bible says that they that
[1:16:09] wait on the Lord he shall renew which
[1:16:12] means you going to get drained down when
[1:16:14] you have to renew something it expires
[1:16:16] right you go to get a library book that
[1:16:17] means the deadline is over you got to
[1:16:20] turn the book in Now You renewed which
[1:16:22] means now you got new life you can go a
[1:16:24] few more more days a few more months a
[1:16:26] few more years amen you should Mount up
[1:16:29] on wings as Eagles that means God is
[1:16:31] going to keep you he's going to sustain
[1:16:33] you he won't put no more on you that you
[1:16:36] can bear now the only thing you've got
[1:16:37] to be in his
[1:16:39] will you've got to be obedient ohy to
[1:16:44] God you get outside his will what did I
[1:16:45] say you delay you deny because God's
[1:16:49] will will be accomplished one way or
[1:16:51] another Jonah yes oh I told you to go
[1:16:55] you Tred to do something different I'm
[1:16:57] going accomplish my will Jonah whether

[1:17:14] path one way or
[1:17:18] another here's the thing with job job
[1:17:21] could not say in that moment that all
[1:17:23] things work job knew right there when it
[1:17:26] happened that he was the
[1:17:29] problem Hallelujah he knew he was the
[1:17:31] problem he couldn't be in that situation

[1:17:51] get on my knees and say Lord thank you
[1:17:56] because you allowed it I'm doing what

[1:18:06] don't have the answers to I can get on
[1:18:08] my knees and say Lord thank you because
[1:18:10] you're in
[1:18:12] control God was in control of every
[1:18:15] aspect of Joseph's life that's why when
[1:18:17] you go through the Bible it says the
[1:18:18] Lord was with Joseph the Lord was with
[1:18:20] Joseph because Joseph was in tune he
[1:18:23] didn't get mad and say I'm not going the
[1:18:24] church today I'm not going to do this
[1:18:27] I'm not going to do that he was locked
[1:18:28] in God was able to keep
[1:18:32] him Lord thank you Jesus verse 36 after
[1:18:35] you have done the will of God you might
[1:18:38] what receive the promise I want to I
[1:18:41] want to break down this last passage
[1:18:43] here and we'll be done amen let's go
[1:18:44] back to verse
[1:18:46] 35 says cast not away therefore your
[1:18:49] confidence now to understand what the
[1:18:51] writer is saying here with the word
[1:18:53] confidence that the Greek word for
[1:18:56] confidence is
[1:18:57] peria the word means boldness and
[1:19:00] depicts a very bold Frank outspoken kind
[1:19:04] of
[1:19:05] language it carries the meaning of being
[1:19:09] forthright blunt and to be straight to
[1:19:12] the point in this verse to the Bold
[1:19:17] Brave and fearless declarations and
[1:19:19] Faith confessions regarding God's
[1:19:21] promises that these Believers had been
[1:19:23] making all right they had been
[1:19:26] professing declaring and laying claim to
[1:19:30] the promises of God's word for their own
[1:19:32] personal lives they had done it
[1:19:35] boldly vocally and publicly what they
[1:19:40] believe they declared loudly so what is
[1:19:42] he telling them keep talking what you've
[1:19:45] been
[1:19:47] talking you saying God Is A Healer you
[1:19:49] may be still sick in your body but that
[1:19:51] shouldn't stop your
[1:19:53] declaration you kid see like they
[1:19:55] getting worse instead of getting better
[1:19:57] still claim him on his altar don't stop
[1:20:00] talking like you've been
[1:20:02] talking because that is your recompense
[1:20:05] of reward once you stop talking you
[1:20:08] start doubting you start
[1:20:11] disbelieving you find yourself
[1:20:14] delaying God's promise in your life that
[1:20:18] is what he's telling them don't throw
[1:20:19] away your confidence am keep speaking
[1:20:22] God upon your life am amen keep speaking
[1:20:25] God's promises in your life over your
[1:20:26] family over your finances over your
[1:20:28] health amen amen he's obligated to
[1:20:31] answer
[1:20:33] right but he has a bigger
[1:20:36] plan and in that moment of weit God is
[1:20:39] doing something church amen and as I
[1:20:42] read this passage of scripture I said
[1:20:43] Lord there are things in my life that I
[1:20:45] have been praying for and I have not
[1:20:47] seen it manifested uhhuh but I'm going
[1:20:49] to thank you while I wait
[1:20:55] cuz I look at like Joseph's
[1:20:57] life all these negatives there was
[1:21:00] nothing positive one thing after next
[1:21:02] God use negativity in his life to
[1:21:04] accomplish his purpose amen amen and his
[1:21:07] will so when you going through your
[1:21:09] stuff don't throw in the towel amen I'm
[1:21:12] talking to Believers tonight right this
[1:21:14] is who he's talking to cast not away
[1:21:17] therefore your confidence amen let's
[1:21:19] give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:21:21] Praise I'll wrap up here with Romans 8
[1:21:25] Verse 18 it says for I reckon that the
[1:21:28] sufferings of this present time
[1:21:30] oh are not worthy to be compared
[1:21:35] somebody say compared compared to what
[1:21:38] God has in store for you so what you
[1:21:41] suffering with right now it does not
[1:21:43] compare to when you get through it yes
[1:21:45] God's got something for you let's get
[1:21:47] Lord hand clap praise amen as our
[1:21:49] brother Ernest come
[1:21:51] amen let's receive him with a hearty
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] amen church I trust I'll share something
[1:21:57] to be an encouragement to you I'm not
[1:21:59] going to prolong the time I'm I'm I'm
[1:22:00] going get on out the way
[1:22:02] amen God bless
[1:22:10] you amen you appreciate the word tonight
[1:22:13] let's give the Lord another hand clap of
[1:22:15] Praise
[1:22:17] amen it's something about the word amen
[1:22:20] but you got to let it find a resting
[1:22:22] place amen you know it's some things
[1:22:25] like he was saying about patience and
[1:22:26] all you know it's something that God
[1:22:29] does in your life and God as we was say
[1:22:32] I was saying last week when God want to
[1:22:35] teach you lessons you can't tell God how
[1:22:37] to teach you those lessons amen he going
[1:22:39] to show you how he want to show you
[1:22:41] that's right amen amen cuz when you come
[1:22:44] out you're going to be as he saw you not
[1:22:47] as you want to be sometimes but you
[1:22:49] going to be as he saw you sometimes we
[1:22:51] get in so much trouble because we
[1:22:53] fighting against what the will of God is
[1:22:56] but we learned early in our Christian
[1:22:57] journey to let go of all of our thoughts
[1:23:00] and desires and all those things and say
[1:23:02] Lord I just want you you know I was
[1:23:04] talking to brother Simmons as a while
[1:23:06] back in the office and I was just
[1:23:09] telling him I was like I says you know I
[1:23:11] only been on the earth a few years
[1:23:14] compared to
[1:23:15] yourself I says
[1:23:18] but sometimes I think why did I have to
[1:23:21] go through or deal with so much so early
[1:23:24] in
[1:23:25] life I said sometimes I dealt with a lot
[1:23:28] of things early and in life and
[1:23:32] sometimes you look at it but I says one
[1:23:34] thing about it I can look back and say I
[1:23:38] learned something from all of it I can
[1:23:40] look back at the lessons if God would
[1:23:43] allow you to see your path you never
[1:23:44] would have wanted to go to or deal with
[1:23:46] certain things but as our brother Maas
[1:23:49] was saying tonight God's Got You In His
[1:23:51] Hands he knows the beginning from the
[1:23:54] end
[1:23:55] you know what I start saying now when
[1:23:56] situations arise it might catch you
[1:23:58] unaware from the beginning but then I
[1:24:00] say Lord you already knew this day would
[1:24:02] come before it came God you already saw
[1:24:05] the situation before it even happened
[1:24:08] and you allowed it just give me the
[1:24:10] strength Hallelujah and the patience to
[1:24:13] go through it and that's my prayer every
[1:24:16] day you know I was praying I was praying
[1:24:19] today I says Lord I was thinking about
[1:24:22] that big shooting that happened in
[1:24:24] in the neighborhood up there my
[1:24:26] sister-in-law's
[1:24:28] neighborhood and I said we living in a
[1:24:31] different
[1:24:32] age where you got these kids now toing
[1:24:36] big guns and in broad daylight they just
[1:24:39] gunning it out wherever they at and I
[1:24:42] says Lord we was talking about it at
[1:24:44] work one of my friends he says he says
[1:24:47] these children you can't talk to them
[1:24:49] when they get a certain age he said they
[1:24:52] friends and things have way more
[1:24:53] influence on them but I believe that
[1:24:58] even though sometimes you might say they
[1:25:00] don't want to hear you but I believe if
[1:25:03] you get down on your knees yes sir and
[1:25:06] you pray
[1:25:07] Hallelujah that they'll hear God one day
[1:25:10] they won't even know sometimes the
[1:25:12] choices that they making but it was mama
[1:25:14] praying for them it was Daddy praying
[1:25:16] for them it was brother somebody praying
[1:25:18] for him Hallelujah cuz that's what it's
[1:25:20] going to take it's going to take God
[1:25:22] getting a hold of somebody's life amen
[1:25:24] that's what it's going to take you think
[1:25:26] about it a brother was preaching T night
[1:25:28] that confidence don't don't let it slip
[1:25:32] don't lose it but that confidence was
[1:25:35] built somewhere sometimes you got to go
[1:25:37] back down memory lane and you got to
[1:25:40] encourage yourself in the Lord and you
[1:25:42] got to think of about where God brought
[1:25:44] you from Hallelujah cuz he brought you
[1:25:47] too far to leave you come on I don't
[1:25:49] believe God brought us this far to leave
[1:25:51] us the devil get in your mind get you
[1:25:53] all confused up but sometimes you got to
[1:25:55] shake yourself and you got to remember
[1:25:58] the Lord hallelujah and what God's done
[1:26:01] for you how many want to remember that
[1:26:02] tonight amen
[1:26:05] amen let us bow our heads
[1:26:08] tonight oh
[1:26:11] Jesus thank you
[1:26:13] Lord thank you for your grace tonight
[1:26:16] Lord thank you Lord for the word that we
[1:26:19] heard
[1:26:20] God God and we don't want to oh God lose
[1:26:24] that
[1:26:26] confidence oh God get weary in our
[1:26:30] journey even though it happens sometimes
[1:26:33] God I pray tonight Lord as the word went
[1:26:36] out God that it gave somebody hope yes
[1:26:40] Lord that it helped somebody look at
[1:26:43] their
[1:26:45] situation and say I feel like holding on
[1:26:48] a little while
