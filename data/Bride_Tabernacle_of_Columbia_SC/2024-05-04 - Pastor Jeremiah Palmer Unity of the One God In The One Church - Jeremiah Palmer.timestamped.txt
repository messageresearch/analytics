[30:09] amen the book of St John
[30:23] 17 a
[30:25] little thought that we
[30:29] was kind of working with back
[30:33] Maran amen so we try to share just a
[30:36] little bit of
[30:39] it excuse
[30:41] me let take John
[30:51] 17 let's start at the 18th verse let's
[30:54] cut it short
[30:59] as thou has sent me into the
[31:02] world even so have I also sent them into
[31:06] the
[31:07] world and for their sake I sanctify
[31:11] myself that they also might be
[31:14] Sanctified through the
[31:17] truth neither pray I for these
[31:20] alone but for them also which Shall
[31:23] Believe on me through their word that
[31:28] they all may be
[31:29] one as thou father are in me and I in
[31:34] thee and they also may be one in us that
[31:39] the world may believe that thou has sent
[31:43] me and the glory which thou gavest me I
[31:46] have given them that they may be one
[31:50] even as we are one i in them thou in me
[31:55] that they may be made perfect
[31:58] in one and that the world may know that
[32:01] thou has sent me and has loved me them
[32:04] also as thou has loved me father bless
[32:08] Thy word Sanctified in Jesus name amen
[32:12] may be
[32:17] seated I want
[32:19] to use for a little thought for a few
[32:23] minutes tonight as we on part three
[32:28] there in
[32:29] Marion the unity of the one God in the
[32:35] one
[32:36] Church the
[32:38] unity of the one God and the one Church
[32:43] my sub topic is being
[32:46] unified being unified amen we
[32:52] read St John and I cut it short because
[32:56] it's a lot to read
[32:59] but just to try to share a little bit of
[33:05] what is
[33:07] Unity what is
[33:11] unity and I know there be be different
[33:15] meanings that people
[33:18] use to clarify to
[33:23] them what
[33:26] Unity really
[33:29] is so I want to read a
[33:32] definition and talking about Christian
[33:35] Unity
[33:36] tonight the unity of the one God in the
[33:40] one Church it says Unity Christian
[33:45] Unity is the result of
[33:49] God bringing together people I like
[33:54] that God bringing together people of
[33:57] different ethics background and social
[34:02] classes
[34:03] into one body by faith in Jesus
[34:10] Christ it's God bringing the people
[34:16] together and we also talk about the
[34:21] church and that church there is not
[34:27] literally talking about any
[34:29] certain SE of um denominations or
[34:33] anything of that like that but that
[34:36] church there is talking about a many
[34:38] member
[34:42] bride Jesus said one place nobody can
[34:45] come to the father father but by
[34:49] me so there is a
[34:53] call that
[34:55] God gives out
[35:00] and the Bible say another place that
[35:02] many are called but only a
[35:04] few servant of God said that's the elect
[35:07] he said that are
[35:10] chosen and there are many people that
[35:13] hear and have heard and
[35:16] hearing the Gospel of Jesus
[35:21] Christ and it gives them an opportunity
[35:25] to either receive it or to reject
[35:31] it now that we know more about the
[35:34] things of God that we know
[35:36] now because we have a better
[35:39] understanding of the things of God we
[35:42] know now that the Ser of God was saying
[35:44] that God
[35:48] predestines in other words it's not
[35:53] man saving
[35:56] nobody but but it's really an act of
[36:01] God in other words it says that before
[36:05] you were even born there's already
[36:07] something in you laying
[36:10] there something to either to receive the
[36:12] word or either to reject
[36:16] it so when the Holy Ghost begin to move
[36:19] upon us and I believe that that's what
[36:22] we have been experiencing I believe
[36:25] somewhere in our Christian Life we heard
[36:28] the Holy Spirit speaking to us you heard
[36:31] a
[36:33] call though you may heard the uh a
[36:36] certain sermon God uses a man under the
[36:39] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and he
[36:42] begin to love that man to speak the
[36:45] things the word of God to
[36:49] you and it's stranged how you know it
[36:51] could be a church full of people and you
[36:54] know everybody hear different things
[36:56] when it come to preaching
[36:59] some just hear good
[37:01] sermons some hear deep things or
[37:04] whatever they call
[37:06] Deep then there's something that hear
[37:09] God's
[37:12] voice and they can recognize that it's
[37:15] not just a preacher that it was
[37:17] something that that came real home to
[37:21] me and God knows how to reach every one
[37:25] of us
[37:27] I never can uh forget the time that I
[37:30] was in uh the county there in Maran and
[37:34] the young man came there preach from the
[37:35] Church of Christ you know came and we
[37:38] was at the service that night and I
[37:40] never can forget it cuz to me it was the
[37:43] beginning of something
[37:46] new to
[37:48] me you know I have been to churches I
[37:51] grew up in church all my
[37:53] life plenty of churches sometime seven
[37:58] days during the week growing up and
[38:01] going to church and hearing preaching
[38:03] and going to
[38:04] church but it's different when you hear
[38:08] something that actually catch
[38:11] you and it's not Mom it's not Daddy you
[38:15] know but it's God then
[38:18] personally visiting
[38:21] you and it has to be to each and every
[38:24] one of us though our parents you we
[38:27] raised our children we should do those
[38:30] things but it come to a place they must
[38:34] receive God
[38:37] themselves in other words they must have
[38:39] a personalized encounter with God
[38:43] visiting
[38:45] them
[38:46] themselves if not they'll be living off
[38:49] of your religion and salvation I want to
[38:54] say there salvation
[38:58] so as I sat there and listen to the
[39:00] young man preach and the Star Lake you
[39:05] know he Pro it was straight is the
[39:09] gate
[39:11] wide
[39:14] straight and my first time hearing
[39:18] anyone uh preach that
[39:22] sermon and to me as we were there and I
[39:25] was in a very bad condition in my life I
[39:28] I was in a a very low
[39:33] Place being taught about the things of
[39:36] God hearing even the things of God going
[39:41] to church like you ought
[39:44] to but it came a time that it got
[39:48] personal I just didn't hear a preacher I
[39:52] believe I heard from the voice of
[39:55] God and before even did the Lord had
[39:58] already done spoke to me about some
[39:59] things but you know and I I never really
[40:04] understood what that really means and
[40:07] there's a lot of things that you may
[40:09] hear you may not understand it
[40:13] fully but I want to let you know if it's
[40:16] really of God it will carry you further
[40:21] in your
[40:23] experience with
[40:25] God because I know what it's like just
[40:28] to be going to church I've been there I
[40:30] did
[40:31] that but going to church didn't
[40:35] change I brought forth a change in my
[40:38] life that I really
[40:42] needed and I always tell people you know
[40:45] it's good to come to church you ought to
[40:47] do
[40:48] that but when you come you must come
[40:51] expecting
[40:54] something I believe now we are a little
[40:57] further down the road I just been
[40:59] looking things you know life is is
[41:02] strange you know from coming down to
[41:05] mull in 27 years old and now I'm
[41:09] 61 I say
[41:12] Lord but the S where it
[41:16] went where it went 27 years
[41:20] old now I'm
[41:24] 61 Lord have mercy so I I'm looking at
[41:28] life and I hope that we we can kind of
[41:32] maybe share with you that like you said
[41:34] life is like a
[41:38] vapor many young people look at their
[41:40] life not by they in school and they got
[41:42] a future they're looking at this and
[41:44] that but before you know it you'll be 27
[41:46] to
[41:48] 28 you'll be making choices making
[41:53] decisions but I want to let you know
[41:56] young people they're the greatest
[41:57] decision you ever can make above all
[42:01] your career and your that's good to have
[42:03] those things it's real good to have a
[42:05] the career but above all of that get God
[42:13] first you may even be successful that's
[42:15] good you may even be a multimillion
[42:18] that's good but get God
[42:22] first you will never ever regret that
[42:26] decision
[42:28] but here now we talking about the unity
[42:31] of the one God in one Church the servant
[42:33] Gospel called message Christ the
[42:34] ministry of God revealed he said God had
[42:37] a three-fold
[42:39] purpose and God was trying to always
[42:43] bring his people to a place of
[42:50] unity but every time God seemed to try
[42:53] to move on the people they seem to
[42:57] always get in their own selfish motives
[43:01] and they try to do it the way they
[43:04] want and then it be confusion it's
[43:09] chaos but God has a plan and a way that
[43:12] he does things and God way is is by his
[43:18] word and as long as we stay with the
[43:21] word and the things of God then we can
[43:24] be unified properly
[43:27] the Ser God it takes us as a renewing of
[43:30] our
[43:31] minds other words have he said let this
[43:34] mind being you that was in
[43:37] Christ see now God's way of leading his
[43:41] church is through the holy
[43:44] spirit that why he said you must
[43:48] be born
[43:49] again see without the holy I'm talking
[43:52] the real Holy Ghost
[43:53] now I believe the real Holy Ghost is
[43:57] will make all of us live the same way
[44:01] it's not two holy
[44:03] ghosts if it make one live right it'll
[44:06] make the other one live
[44:08] right if one be clean then all ought to
[44:11] be
[44:13] clean see because it's not any man doing
[44:16] it's the holy ghost moving inside of
[44:20] us he is the uh
[44:25] director we don't tell him what to do we
[44:28] just listen to what he said we don't
[44:32] question what God said we just believe
[44:35] what God Said and God will never leave
[44:38] you to do something outside of the
[44:45] word you know I always in Serv of God
[44:48] said he said that the Bible is my
[44:54] absolute it must be dovetails must be
[44:56] written
[44:57] here regardless of what we hear
[45:00] regardless of what things that may come
[45:03] you know if I want to find out the
[45:05] exactly truth of something you know even
[45:08] what has been preached to us this hour
[45:10] we carry it back to the
[45:12] scriptures I believe that's what he
[45:14] taught us that if it doesn't Dove tail
[45:17] with the script he said leave that
[45:20] alone and not just compare one
[45:24] place it must go from Genesis the
[45:28] Revelation it don't need no other
[45:30] interpretation we have had the right
[45:33] interpretation of the scripture for this
[45:35] hour God didn't sent us that voice that
[45:39] gave us that now we must uh have a
[45:43] revelation that what he is saying and be
[45:45] to carry
[45:47] that back to the
[45:51] Bible because it's got to be Christ
[45:53] that's what the whole the message is
[45:55] Christ
[45:57] he ought to be the center of everything
[45:59] we
[45:59] preach he ought to be the very focus of
[46:02] what we do in our churches he ought to
[46:05] be the very center of how we being
[46:08] led B said they that are led by the
[46:11] spirit of God they
[46:14] are they are the sons of God so with the
[46:18] spirit of God leading you he lead you to
[46:21] the
[46:23] word and anytime something lead you away
[46:26] from the word word get away from
[46:29] it cuz it's not
[46:32] God and and if it's God then I like this
[46:35] God word will produce a character and a
[46:39] life in
[46:42] you see that's what the Holy Ghost come
[46:44] to
[46:46] do it come to uh what he come to do
[46:49] actually was bring the reflection of his
[46:52] own
[46:54] self Christ in you the hope of
[46:58] glory see so the life that we living is
[47:02] not you come on now it's not us it's him
[47:07] amen and God don't want to see us he
[47:09] want to see himself we ought to be the
[47:13] very reflection of the
[47:14] word your life ought to be a living
[47:18] testimony that Jesus Christ is not dead
[47:21] but he's
[47:22] alive how do you know can he live in me
[47:26] he lives in
[47:28] you see the life not the quotes the very
[47:36] life if the quotes not producing the
[47:39] life it got to be the wrong
[47:45] quotes get back to the word to serve go
[47:48] we got to get
[47:50] back we make things so
[47:53] complicated and it should be simple yes
[47:57] I know now we know we made things
[48:01] complicated and it should be
[48:03] simple
[48:06] Christ Tabernacle inner people
[48:09] again uniting under one headship the
[48:13] Holy
[48:16] Ghost see as he said here let me read
[48:20] some of that St John
[48:28] 21 he said that they all may be one as
[48:32] thy father are in me and I you and I in
[48:37] thee excuse me that there also may be
[48:39] one in us that the world may believe
[48:43] that thou has sent
[48:46] me
[48:48] see and that's what the word actually
[48:50] looking for they are looking for
[48:54] people that is reflect in Christ not
[48:59] just what we say out of our
[49:01] mouth we have done a lot of talking
[49:04] about
[49:05] it but where is the life to go with
[49:09] it where is the life that go with what
[49:12] we sat talking
[49:15] about you know it been years that we
[49:18] didn't use a frame of thought you know
[49:21] you know about the message and these
[49:23] things but it got to be Christ that's
[49:26] what the message is
[49:28] Christ is bringing God back on Earth
[49:32] again inside of a
[49:37] people because the church world has this
[49:39] thing in
[49:41] chaos not only of them even not going to
[49:44] come in our
[49:46] ranks we got so much fanaticism and so
[49:49] much things but but you know stay with
[49:53] the word
[49:57] going go to the
[50:00] scripture M me to First
[50:03] Corinthians 12
[50:07] Unity of the one God we must to he
[50:11] Israel the Lord our God is one
[50:14] God
[50:16] one one
[50:19] Faith one
[50:21] baptism see one Holy
[50:25] Ghost to bring
[50:28] a many member bride into such a
[50:34] Unity First
[50:37] Corinthians going to drop
[50:39] down
[50:42] 12 and
[50:49] 18 Serv of God was saying this he said
[50:52] that the problem with the church that
[50:55] everybody just trying to do things that
[50:59] they not even
[51:03] called it's like the parts of your
[51:08] body the hand can't do what the leg
[51:11] supposed to
[51:13] do though they are part of their body
[51:16] but they got their own particular
[51:20] function scri
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] 1218 say but now has
[51:29] God set the members who set
[51:34] them every one of them in the
[51:37] body as it had pleased him I want
[51:41] to God said it in the body it has
[51:45] pleased him so God uh doesn't justu
[51:49] things to be doing
[51:51] it God has a purpose why he does it he
[51:55] calls every one of us for
[51:59] something God has never called anybody
[52:02] for
[52:03] nothing there is a part that you and I
[52:07] must play if we are part of the
[52:11] body every part of your physical body
[52:13] there has a particular
[52:15] function and if that part isn't working
[52:18] properly it affects the whole
[52:21] body so is it when it come to the
[52:24] spiritual body of Christ
[52:27] you are important don't ever think you
[52:30] are not you are important to God
[52:33] regardless of what people think of you
[52:35] you are important to God you're not here
[52:38] to please
[52:39] people but you want to please
[52:42] God you're not here to please the church
[52:44] or the preacher but you want to please
[52:47] God in everything you do Lord I want to
[52:50] be pleasing to you regardless of how
[52:54] everybody else think about it I just
[52:56] want to be under the leadership of what
[52:59] you have called me
[53:05] for everybody can't be the
[53:09] foot but we need the
[53:13] foot so so many times is that and I'm
[53:16] finding out that what happens to people
[53:19] that they want to be
[53:22] something but you know what c you got to
[53:25] try to be
[53:30] nothing most of the one that want to be
[53:33] seen and want to uh uh you know to be on
[53:36] this um platter stere
[53:39] type I want to be in the
[53:43] Forefront that's not the way of
[53:47] Christ normally word God say would God
[53:50] call a man for something he runs from it
[53:56] not this
[53:59] hour they almost try to make it
[54:04] happen and when you do that then you
[54:07] make a mess you bring a reproach upon
[54:14] Christ let me read something Len this is
[54:17] a footnote okay but it just tied right
[54:20] in and it says about the body of
[54:24] Christ it says that the church in the
[54:26] New Testament is called the body of
[54:29] Christ and reflects the spiritual
[54:32] organism of the whole church on Earth he
[54:36] said when the local church is called the
[54:39] body of
[54:41] Christ the spiritual a aspects is
[54:45] emphasized as the church is considered
[54:47] to be the body so
[54:51] individual
[54:52] members are seen as parts of of the
[54:58] body and this is kind of got I use back
[55:01] home said for any church to function
[55:05] properly every member must do his or her
[55:10] part in a harmonous spirit of
[55:15] cooperation with other members
[55:20] see in harmony not out of order in
[55:24] harmony not try to to do what somebody
[55:27] else do no find out what God called you
[55:31] for and when you find it then you begin
[55:34] to humble yourself and you begin to work
[55:37] in at in
[55:39] harmony as the spirit of God lead
[55:43] us and if we can do it in that that's
[55:46] what get us a lot of time you know
[55:48] people don't like that you know
[55:51] order not God's order because nowaday
[55:55] that we finding out not well we we we
[55:57] think that God don't have order but God
[56:00] has order he set things in
[56:04] order he set the church in
[56:08] order he picked a fivefold Ministry and
[56:13] each one of them have their particular
[56:15] job their
[56:17] function and they're to be respected but
[56:20] also they are to work in harmony as the
[56:23] Holy Spirit lead them under the
[56:26] inspiration of
[56:29] God to teach and to preach the people of
[56:33] God the things that they
[56:36] need in order that we can function
[56:42] properly it's like so many time you know
[56:44] and thank God for you know people here
[56:46] that when time for the tent of different
[56:48] things you know everybody do the part
[56:51] that they
[56:53] do everybody know what they do any there
[56:57] one that maybe don't is well can I help
[57:00] yes we we need
[57:02] helpers
[57:04] badly barely we need
[57:07] helpers but there's something that all
[57:09] of us could do Ain but carrying a bag of
[57:13] ice carrying a table putting cloth on a
[57:16] table there is something even for the
[57:17] little children can help that's why we
[57:19] let them help
[57:21] chairs grab a say y'all grab a chair is
[57:25] getting near that seat seon
[57:27] to to prepare it why because we want
[57:31] things to work in a Harmony so that the
[57:34] Holy Spirit you know can can be pleased
[57:37] with what we do no selfish
[57:40] motives no no great great
[57:43] person I do this now no no no no we all
[57:49] helpers one of another for what purpose
[57:53] did God get Glory
[57:56] that's that's it right there God get not
[57:59] you not nobody God for the glorification
[58:03] of God whatever you do it because you
[58:06] want God to get the glory in
[58:10] it no self it about
[58:13] I no it's about
[58:17] him and if we're not doing thing for
[58:19] that purpose then we are doing it in
[58:24] vain see
[58:27] but you must understand he said that the
[58:29] church must understand what the purpose
[58:31] of God is for our
[58:33] lives it's not just about you know you
[58:36] know appreciate brother Simon and the
[58:38] pastor over the years that been trying
[58:40] to hold things together been trying to
[58:42] teach us and lead us in the right way so
[58:46] we must understand that we got to pull
[58:49] together we are more strong and more
[58:52] unified where we can come
[58:54] together but pulling this way one
[58:57] pulling that way one pulling it's hard
[59:00] to get anything
[59:02] done so that's why we we need the Holy
[59:06] Ghost and if we all have that the holy
[59:09] spirit in us that Mind Of God we
[59:12] understand we are working
[59:16] together that God get the glory that
[59:19] people want to come when the tent
[59:21] meeting when the tent meeting oh I'll be
[59:24] there because
[59:26] they feel the spirit they see the unity
[59:29] Al they say man y'all working together
[59:31] me said man we just appreciate coming
[59:33] cuz y'all know how to work together you
[59:35] know what I said brother thank
[59:37] God they don't see the struggle behind
[59:42] it special you know everybody see when
[59:46] the tent get up the lights under it the
[59:48] chairs there everything there but they
[59:50] don't see when ain't nothing been
[59:53] there and you got old people like me
[59:55] brother ear them trying to put a tent up
[59:58] and struggle with
[1:00:01] something we looking for young brothers
[1:00:04] and whatnot to help us and they
[1:00:06] come but see nobody see that but all of
[1:00:09] it still is for the glory of God we
[1:00:12] don't complain about man no thank
[1:00:16] God we able to do these things you ought
[1:00:19] to thank God that God give you something
[1:00:22] to do I don't believe nobody going to go
[1:00:25] to heaven that they ain't doing
[1:00:27] nothing
[1:00:30] no if you putting up a sign if you
[1:00:32] passing out tracks you doing something
[1:00:36] you witness to somebody invite somebody
[1:00:38] to come you doing
[1:00:41] something it may look little but it's
[1:00:43] great cuz that one person you invite
[1:00:46] might be the one might be the last one
[1:00:48] to get us out of here who
[1:00:52] knows see so that's why our mindset
[1:00:55] andin got to be whatever I do for Jesus
[1:00:58] I want it to be
[1:01:00] real I don't have to have you know um
[1:01:03] you know somebody telling me Oh brother
[1:01:05] brother thank you no no no I I don't
[1:01:06] need that a lot of time I don't like
[1:01:09] that I rather
[1:01:11] not don't don't say nothing about me
[1:01:14] don't even it don't I don't matter if
[1:01:16] you never
[1:01:17] know cuz I know that what God sees and
[1:01:22] then the purpose I'm doing it is not for
[1:01:24] you to be see
[1:01:26] me but it's because that my love for God
[1:01:30] that I I'll be happy with to do
[1:01:32] something for the Lord I mean all that
[1:01:35] he done done for
[1:01:38] us and you don't want to do nothing for
[1:01:40] God the god that spared

[1:02:06] that how much God look God keep a roof
