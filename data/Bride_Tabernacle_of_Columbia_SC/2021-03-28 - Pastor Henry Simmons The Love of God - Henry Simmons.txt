you from moving lord bless now in jesus name we pray amen the book of romans five so we want to talk this morning concerning the love of god i wish i could sing oh how i love him my breath my sunshine while all in all the gree great creator became my savior and all god's fullness maybe sister pam can get ready and sing a little bit of that after we read romans 5 and 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into the grace when we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulation also knowing that tribulation work is patient and patient experience experience hope and hope makers is not ashamed because the love of god is shedded abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which has given us so when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man would one die yet prevention for a good man some would even dare to die but god commanded his love towards us and that while we were yet sentenced christ died for us much more than been now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life may god bless you reading towards you may be seated the great creator became [Music] our savior amen ohio down from his glory heavily story my god and savior came and jesus was his name mourning a manger to his own a stranger a man a sorrow tears in agony oh how i love him i adore him my my sunshine my all in all the grey cream became my savior and all god's goodness [Music] oh how i love him [Music] my all in all the great creator became my savior and all god's glory and all gospel next dwelleth in him without reluctance flesh and blood his substance amen praise god i'm glad he came this morning as i look at romans 5 and for a good while i was just thinking on the love of god and and what it means to mean what it should mean to each and every one of us the love of god you know i can but talk to you a little bit about the love of god this morning it says falling in love with jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me you know sometimes the bible said whosoever find that the wife find it the good thing there's something about when the individuals think that they're in love and when they are in love it means an awful lot to them and i i thought about the love of god and what love is all about the bible says in saint john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave and i thought about love he gave his only begotten son whichever believe in him should not perish you have everlasting life when we think about love we think about giving we cannot use the word love because love is something that we have to express [Music] love is something that is manifest something that is made known something that is revealed so love the love of god here it says in romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ without the love of god there's no peace with god but we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ thank god for brother branham bye from trinity died we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ he said by whom also we have access by faith into disgrace wherein we stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god [Music] you know those are the outstanding statements that paul was writing and mean it means so much to us it's by the grace of god we stand we could not stand without his grace and he's talking about we rejoice in this faith that god has given us for what god has done for us amen it causes us to rejoice because not only rejoicing in what he's done for us he said also the hope of the glory of god [Music] amen god got more that he's going to express unto us and and more that he's got in store for us are you with me so god love is so amazing it's beyond our comprehension but nevertheless he lets us experience his love here on the earth and sometimes people want love from family members love for mama love from daddy love from siblings or whatever people are seeking love in many ways and people are looking for love in the wrong places but we're talking we're not just talking about feeling your love and errors or lust type love we're talking about the love of god when we speak of the love of god the english word is not sufficient so it talks about the greek word of agape love god's love so man does not have that love just god to love jesus is the love of god expressed so in order to have a god pay love we're going to go go down a little bit a bit farther he says in the third verse and not only so but we glory in what what causes us the glory and the things that we're going through we're glory in tribulation i i i'm talking about sometimes when we're going through look like the worst of the worst things that are seem to be unbearable but we glory in tribulation because we have something that gives us the ability even though we're going through to glory so we have something that excels our tribulation something that amen causes our tribulation to seemed to be a light thing a thing that cannot overtake us or overcome us it gives us the power to defeat our tribulation to conquer our tribulation to defeat our tribulation so we glory in tribulation also knowing that tribulation working so god allows revelation to works patience and patience he says experience and experience hope amen and hope makers is not ashamed because what the fifth verse because what because the love of god is what the love of god is shedded about now how is it shattered abroad in our heart how do we know that we have the love of god and how is the love of god how do we get the love of god because he said it shut it abroad in our hearts by what so a god paid love but god's love is shedded abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost okay so first of all therefore being justified by faith faith in what faith in what god has done for us so we'll as as we look farther in these verses we'll find that god has done something for us and when he's done something for us and we'll reset and we receive what he's done for us amen then we become amen uh we began to receive his love inside of us amen then the love of god can be expressed not only in jesus christ but god's love can be expressed in our lives so god amen not only express his love towards us through jesus christ but god wants to express his love in our lives he wants you to amen know how it feels to aim aiming to have god's love he wants to know that amen you you can have peace and you can be justified amen and have peace with god he says because the holy ghost is shedded abroad in our hearts because the love of god is shedding wrought in our hearts by the holy ghost which has given us for when we were yet without what without strength in due time christ died for see the thing is falling in love with jesus is to understand praise god it's an understanding we could fall in love with a lot of things the bible said love not the world these are the things that are of the world for their experience in progress says there are many women out there and there are three women that you should not fall in love with and that's one of the women is miss lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of the life don't fall in love with those women are you with me see you can fall in love with those women amen but the bible said love not the world neither the things of the world for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and what these things are not of the father but of the world and all of that'll pass away amen but god's love will not pass away again pay love but see we fall in love with the wrong one we fall in the love with miss lust of the flesh amen lust of the eye and the pride of life so don't fall in love with these ladies all you really mean because these ladies the bible says her house is the way to hell going down into the chambers of death that's what proverbs 7 says amen don't go in to her house because you're going into a place of death amen don't love the world okay the bible said whosoever find us the wife founded a good thing amen don't fall in love with these strange women amen proverbs 5. you got to watch these strange women miss lust of the flesh the eyes and the pride of life don't fall in love with those women okay let's go on a little further christ died for us when we were ungodly i mean i don't know about you but i know i was ungodly [Music] but god that didn't stop look god for loving me [Music] in spite of how you lived and how you conducted your life god still loves you amen you can look back at your life and you say why did god choose me why did god choose to love me see because there are many that don't set in the house of god there are many that are not tuning in to listen amen to the word of god but somehow god has gotten your attention enough that you said i love you lord i love you enough to tune in i love you enough to come to church and god he sees your love he sees your love by your action and god knows that there's something inside of you to disarm something and and god wants to meet that desire of your heart because god you know it's something about god can look deeper amen then all of the devil tries to give you all kind of excuses why you ought not to love the lord i i want to give you some uh some reasons why you should love him why you shouldn't love him and why amen it's not a force or something that god is going to force on you but but because you can see his love towards you it's something you know this love is for me this is what i needed all my life i needed this kind of love mother couldn't give it father couldn't give it amen friends wife and husband can't give me this kind of love but i needed this love amen this kind of love amen and i i i i i'm of the persuasion that as many people that have come to church for year in and year out that went through all emotions of everything that they knew to do that was supposedly godly in a sense they have accepted jesus in their life but they have not gone deep enough to understand what god's love mean to them and and and and that's what i'm saying to it it can become a somewhat a tradition somewhat form and fashion amen but to know the love of god amen and that's what i i i want you to understand amen that if you fall in love with jesus then it's the best thing that could it's the best thing that could ever happen to you amen it's the best thing that they you say well you know when i find my wife that's the best thing to happen to me i find my husband was the best thing that ever happened to me even my children was the best thing that ever happened to me amen my job is you know some folk they mean they they thank god for their job and they would give more honor to their job than they would give to god's word amen i mean jesus seemed to be secondary they're more happy for the money that they got the house that they live in the car that they drive they give more honor to that than they give to the lord but we understand all this all this carnal stuff will pass away amen i mean you can lose all of that but don't you lose jesus all of that can you you can lose but don't lose jesus amen the love of god i believe we'll hold true we'll do everything we can do to try to hold on to the natural things that we got even if it means giving up coming to church eating or giving up your faithfulness to god i i got to make my ends meet i got to do this i got to do how about serving the lord how about putting him first amen does he means that much to you somebody said my husband won't let me amen come to church my wife won't let me amen serve the law amen if that means more but once you come in contact with a god pay love amen you let nothing separate you from the love of god amen when you come but you must have you you must have that experience in your life if you do not have that experience of god's love then something will come by and separate you come on somebody you know how folks get involved marriages and amen and family members of mama try to run the home and grandmama and all of that get in and separate marriages are you with me but if you really love your husband or love your wife then you say well i said in sickness and in health amen praise god and you said until death do its part i that's what i say i i i meant what i said and i'm standing on what i said amen see uh you when you really love that individual amen amen when they go through certain things you can what you just simply amen oh you know what happened in my house it ain't none of your business isn't that right amen we need to attend to our own business are you what man so if you really love somebody don't run down the street and say you know what my husband said you know what he did you know ah no no no no you need to get on your knees and pray god help my husband help my wife they meant lord i'm standing in the gap i'm here praying god you save lord you do something god about the situation because i love him i'm gonna stand in the gap i'm gonna make up the hedge i'm going to intercede amen it's easy to walk away from something that you don't really care about amen if you care about your walk with the lord it's it's difficult to walk away from somebody you really care about some folks have gotten beaten some folks have gotten uh all kind of stuff to happen to them i love them that's just talking about feeding your love that's not real love to love somebody to beat on you and stuff they don't love you are you with me but some folks stay there because of just the there's the feeling of love just that kind of love they they feel god i love him i love it no matter you know so they rather die than they leave them oh you look me because they feel like i ain't i love them but no matter what they you know but when we love god enough i mean you're talking about a god that never will do you wrong he'll never beat him on you he'll never do he never tell you you ain't nothing or you are no good uh he's never down you say kind of things that hurt your feelings uh uh i'll cause you he only shows that he cares for you he wants to do you good and not evil oh you would be he always blessing you amen it's just it's not in this nature it's not in his character to do anything but good to you [Applause] are you with me so who wouldn't serve a god like this now the devil is another fellow now amen praise god when you're trying to do the right thing the devil are getting angry with you the devil get angry with you he'll do everything he can to do amen if you turn from him amen the devil gets so mad when you stop they meant drinking alcohol the devil gets so mad he'll take you through details he'll do all kind of stuff he'll make you feel like you're gonna die i'm gonna kill you if you don't stop get another drink and you start smoking these cigarettes ah you you gotta you'll make this keep on doing it god don't do that does it god does you good amen he's not gonna make you and force you he's not gonna amen if we're gonna be addicted to anything we're gonna be addicted to his love are you with me because that's what god eh god's a love and it's so rich and so sweet amen praise god you can still have money in the bank praise god you can still raise your family and you can have amen praise god holidays some of these things that the devil his love comes with the price you're gonna have to pay for his love but just think jesus paid the debt that we hold amen to god amen that we can have peace with god and we can enjoy the things of god hallelujah he paid the debt amen somebody said i owe the debt i could not pay he paid the debt he did not owe oh you would be so thank god for the love of god amen amen the prophet god said and know him is love to know him is love isn't that right if you know god if you know jesus is love praise god you cannot you know you know it's not something that you can almost say well i got it now you know don't you it testifies of itself love is going to speak for himself amen god's love amen you don't have to try to say i i i if i didn't have the holy ghost sometimes you're saying that i don't have it i would do this come on love is not i mean the holy ghost is not going to constrain you like that if i wasn't saved maybe you're not but to be saved is you know it's just this is who you are amen i mean the love of god it's there it is expressing itself amen i i'm constrained by his love amen there was something about being constrained amen praise god somebody said i've wrapped up i'm tired of it i'm taking it up it is love amen so how can i do anything different amen it doesn't matter how many times how many stripes they whipped him with no matter how many lies they told on him it didn't matter how they met excruciating the pain when they were whipping him with the thrones in it and pulling the meat out of his back amen praise god he didn't say okay okay if y'all don't stop it i'm gonna call uh 12 leading the rangers and they'll take care of you no he went through that suffering because he was showing us there's some things amen amen when you when you love god so loved us that's the kind of love that he because he loved us amen can you see somebody taking a whip with spikes and and things that when it when it hits your back and pull the meat out your body amen and then and then they what hit hit you again and and he he must have felt all of that for you and me i mean he was human and he was divine but he loved us and he had the power he had it was not because he was weak he had the power amen to not take it he said father it would be possible letting this cup pastor not my will but what he knew that that was the will of god that he would suffer that he had to go through something and brother and sister amen we have a joy that is set before us amen that we can inspire the shame and we can go through something why it's not it's not us going it's the love of god that's in us praise god despite of what how folk hates you how folk do you wrong you love them you don't try to love them you don't say this is what i supposed to do this is just what you are as a christian you know i says you know we have no problem with the people serving the lord if they look if they loved him it's difficult it's difficult to deal with with little problems that come up in the home when you don't love that individual and some christians ain't going strong enough to they say when a little problem come up you can hear some of that stuff that come out their mouth they can't they can't curse but they sure can come close too and somehow you push them a little bit further they might curse you out are you with me but when you love one another if you really love that person in spite of what they say or what they do you're gonna just ease down on your knees and say lord help my husband help my wife first thing you go mama you know what that old devil said [Music] all of a sudden the discreet loving husband become a devil and you hear what that devil says you see what i'm saying but if you love them you go to not mama you go on your knees and you cry to god god help him are you with me people's turn amen when they're going through their tribulation they don't join tribulation they actually they turn and what's in them come out of them and god is saying amen no matter what you do amen to jesus christ all he can do is steal love no matter what you say or how many false witnesses all he can say father forgive them i cannot speak evil against to them because they've done evil to me all i can do say father forgive them because they don't understand what they do that's what love does i said if you if you spend your time bathing and you're just just warning and just enjoying the love of god just think about all that he went through for us and all that he's doing for us and wade brought his plum and how he saved us i didn't have to do it but he did and you just you just praise the lord hallelujah you know you forget about all the other problems you forget about all the other stuff but but you know what the devil makes his job is to get your attention away from the love of god he he he points out all your problems all the situations all the the job and all the school and all that family oh it shows you all the fault in your husband all the fault in your wife all the fallen church folk all the fought in the bridge but when you get to loving god it blinds you it blinds you to everybody else you just having to see you don't want nothing to take your your your relationship with god away don't let no not steal that from you the devil is a thief and he'll do anything to try to steal your joy he'll start to steal your peace and amen he tries to take that love away from you amen but you you must not allow the devil to come in that old thief and steal from you praise god you don't understand his tactics you understand what

gotta i gotta close i got too much to tell so let me move away from here but we we realized that there that's much in romans 5. you can go back over the whole chapter sometime but here in ephesians 3 i want to just deal with that a little bit and then i got to go to some other places but i won't have time to finish but i want to try to finish a little bit to give you a little bit ephesians 3 and intend to know the love of god ephesians 3 and 10 it says to the intent that now until the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose god has a purpose for you and the purpose for your life are you with me which he purpose in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by faith of him wherefore i desire that you faint not in my tribulation for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees into the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his what riches of his glory to strengthen amen strengthened with might by his spirit in the what in a man there's an inner man that god want to deal with in the inner man that christ may what seventeen verse that quiets may what dwell in your heart by faith that you may being rooted and what grinded in love see i i sometimes we love but we're not rooted we're not grounded rooted you know you have to dig deep and let it get let it get get some root you don't want to throw it on the shadow ground you want to dig down and let let it take root are you with me so the word of god need to take root in our lives you know you can you can you can plant stuff but if it don't never take root amen it would never bring forth the harvest but when it takes root then you can see a manifestation amen as it grows right brother fred you see the fruit amen so it's got to take root if it does see that's what happened it's not that the love has not been expressed and not that you've not experienced the love of god but the love got to take it's got to take root and it's got to be grounded amen and it's got to it's got to settle amen and i i'm not saying that we say well i i i know god loved me and i know i've experienced the love of god but has that love taking root you know it's something something like building a good relationship a good marriage uh sometimes you have to go through things and understand one another and as you go through things and understand one another then your love began to take root amen who you thought you loved and who you thought you know what i'm saying then going through your little trials and little tests and tribulations and how you respond you learn to my mom say you learn to love one another amen you're learning to love one another more by the things you go through you know you can look back over the years and say look what we've been through together amen we've been through a lot of things raising the children doing this doing that we're into a lot of things a lot of stones amen praise god so and so it's difficult to to you know to to to destroy something that's grounded amen something that's rooted amen it's difficult just to come and just destroy it easy amen when you just got the love of god it ain't taking deep root in you amen you just saved but it ain't taken that love of god got to take deep root like lord i love you and then you get experience after experience things happen in life and it just builds you it just settles you and you become more stable amen we don't want people it meant just to be at the same level all the time but the love of god got to take root the word got to get deeper and deeper deeper in us amen in the inner man oh all of a sudden it hit places in us brother friend you know things have started happening god is so good and go down and you know it's better than the best meal you could ever eat amen because it's taking root he said may be able to comprehend the love be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the what limp and the depth and the what so that see that there's different areas that god want to express as love amen once it's rooted and you he wants you to be able to comprehend comprehend how good god is amen god wants you to be able to comprehend it amen once you come let me start understanding hallelujah oh i believe that uh people just simply said jesus died on the cross and i accept them as my savior but they don't come into comprehension it's deeper than that it means more than that amen he's not only my protector he's my provider amen praise god he's my joy he's my peace amen praise god he's everything to me praise god you don't have some experience in your relationship that rooted and grounded you know he bought me two every trial and every touch everything will have faith god was with me he never left me let me praise god hallelujah oh the darkness might have shook his head amen praise god man might have forsake you but god never forsook me he never left me oh his love i love him i love the lord he heard my cry oh he heard my cry hallelujah who wouldn't serve a god like this who wouldn't serve a god like this praise god i'll tell you when you talk about your troubles god knows your troubles amen god knows what you go through in the night time when you feel it all alone god lift you up praise god something about your roots something about being grounded amen that don't ever come to you in the night did he tell you you're all by yourself you you're lonely you need somebody and jesus comes and i'm here i'm here i am right here now in your lonely moments in your own i'm here praise god amen nobody can be what god can be amen whatever he needs to be to you he'll be that he'll be that to you whatever it needs why because he supplies he supplies all our needs they make god give you what you need praise god somebody said he may not give us what we want but he show give us what we need praise god hallelujah because he promised to supply all of our needs to love him i i i feel like that's why we miss him so much that's why we miss because once you're in love with somebody for folk can tell when you're in love you know all of a sudden the person comes to church and all of a sudden they're smiling and going so what's wrong then you find out oh you know they act a little different even in the house what's going on who you talking to on that phone because all of a sudden you're smiling and going on some strange things happening in this house you know what i'm saying and you go to walk on on there some of these parents know what i'm talking about sometimes they 12 13 years old think they found somebody acting all strange are you what man you know if that happens in the natural cause then that's strength what about in the spirit when god is ministering to you and showing his love and kindness toward you one when god is you experience the love of god and god is moving in your life what about then when you see god moving praise god it caused you to act a little strange folks said mama said what happened son well i went to the church they met something began to happen down in the inside little by little he's bringing change in my life praise god change start coming praise god the next thing i looked and amen i was a new creature why because god amen if any man be in christ he is a new creature a new creation amen why because god love is coming me oh lord have mercy hallelujah no wonder you're acting like you're acting praise god happy smiling when you ought to be sad because it's something that's happening i i got to say this and then i got to close there's one verse i wanted to get to but i won't be able to get down but first john you can read the whole book the first john to really get some of those points that i would like to express but here it says to know the love of god that can pass us the 19th verse that you may be able to comprehend in 18th verse the breadth and length and depth and height the 19th verse to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of god see once you're filled with the love of god the fullness of god then what happens when you're filled with the fullness of god see what happens he said here now to him that is able to do what let's see what happens why we don't get to exceeding abundantly because we're not rooted in groundness but if you want to exceed it and abundantly if you want that if you want the exceeding and abundantly then you got to fall in love fall in love with jesus falling in love with jesus is the what the best thing that ever happened and that's the best thing that could ever happen to you in your life that you fall in love with jesus see something about it really uh taking uh uh uh a root in your life that this this is jesus god it's real this love that when i accept it and i received jesus into my life this this it really took an effect on me praise god i don't care you you know you say i wasn't going to tell nobody but i you didn't i mean you couldn't because it they began to shine you begin to glow you begin to stop doing stuff and you just i just stopped no you didn't stop the love of god praise god just it took it away i remember a sister i had two elders

wintertime and i might sit there and read some whole psalms 119 and then i might read a few more and i'll set to enjoy them they tell me about the whole time but i want to say to you what i experienced she said she had a little tobacco snuff in her mouth and she said every now and then she had to do a little spit and the sister did and she said and uh i could hear brother william
