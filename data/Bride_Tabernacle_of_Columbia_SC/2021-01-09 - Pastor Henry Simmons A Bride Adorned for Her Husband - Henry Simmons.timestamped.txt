[21:14] amen
[21:17] the book of revelation 21
[21:22] didn't know what to say
[21:27] i said i wasn't going to send out an
[21:30] announcement that we was not having
[21:32] service
[21:34] and i wasn't gonna send out one that we
[21:36] was gonna have
[21:38] i said until brother jeremiah i said
[21:41] those that come
[21:42] show welcome to come i said
[21:45] right now i'm just praying
[21:50] we know that the numbers are increasing
[21:53] as far as the pandemic
[21:58] i wouldn't want to be responsible for
[21:59] putting anybody in harm's way
[22:04] so i said be led by the spirit
[22:09] we thank you for being extra
[22:12] cautious because in a time like these
[22:17] you can't be too careful
[22:20] so i said to you thank you for your
[22:23] cooperation
[22:25] thank you for your support
[22:29] those that want to press their way
[22:33] feel free to press your way
[22:38] i thought between brother jeremiah and
[22:41] brother earnest
[22:42] one of them was going to take it tonight
[22:45] but
[22:45] i was prepared so god bless you thank
[22:48] you
[22:51] since i didn't say anything he's
[22:53] probably confused them
[22:55] god is good amen
[22:58] revelation 21
[23:03] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[23:07] for the first heaven in the first earth
[23:08] was passed away and there were no more
[23:10] sea and i john saw the holy city new
[23:12] jerusalem
[23:13] coming down from god out of heaven
[23:16] prepared at the bride of dawn for her
[23:20] husband
[23:21] may god bless you towards you may be
[23:22] seated
[23:26] i like to look at
[23:29] this verse says a bride a dawn for her
[23:34] husband
[23:36] we say we are not
[23:39] in layout of seal which is the seventh
[23:41] church age but we're in the broad age
[23:45] we say the church ages comes to the end
[23:49] in revelation 3 in revelation 4 he says
[23:52] to the bride to come up here
[23:55] so we escape lay out the seal
[23:59] and we come up into the bride age
[24:03] so we come out of laodicea and we come
[24:06] into christ who is the word
[24:08] are you with me so we want to talk about
[24:12] the bride
[24:13] adorning for her husband
[24:18] very important because in this age
[24:22] there's a contrast
[24:26] the bride has an endowment that is
[24:28] expected of her
[24:30] a husband
[24:33] wants to see her are tied a certain way
[24:36] and dressed a certain way
[24:41] you know it's something to come to the
[24:44] wedding
[24:44] into the marriage and you still got your
[24:48] rollers in your hair
[24:52] maybe you got your work clothes on
[24:57] that means you didn't come to be married
[25:03] because you did not
[25:08] dress for a wedding are you with me
[25:13] the contrast here is revelation 17.
[25:19] in other words
[25:23] john said i saw this new jerusalem
[25:27] prepared as a bride of dawn for a
[25:29] husband
[25:31] we look at three things deprived
[25:37] the bride a dawn
[25:42] husband so we want to put emphasis on
[25:46] three things today
[25:49] the bride husband and
[25:54] adon
[25:57] here it says in revelation 17
[26:03] it shows not the bride but it shows
[26:08] the contrast chosen harlot
[26:13] and the hollard she is adorning herself
[26:16] for her husband and her husband
[26:22] is satan are you with me
[26:28] so here in revelation 17 he says
[26:31] and there came one of the seven angels
[26:34] which had the seven
[26:35] vows to talk with me saying
[26:39] to me come here and i will show thee
[26:42] the judgment of the great what
[26:45] poor that set upon many waters
[26:50] with whom the kings of the earth have
[26:52] committed fornication
[26:53] and in the habits of the earth has been
[26:55] made drunk with the wine of her
[26:56] fornication
[26:58] so this is the bride of jesus christ
[27:03] the bride that's a dawn for her husband
[27:07] paul says i expose you to one husband
[27:14] but this woman here is a
[27:18] and she's a fornicator
[27:22] it says with whom the kings of the earth
[27:27] has committed fornication so he carried
[27:30] me away
[27:31] unto the spirit until the wilderness and
[27:34] i saw
[27:36] a woman set upon a scarlet colored beast
[27:38] full of names of blasphemous having
[27:40] seven heads and ten horns
[27:43] and the woman was arrayed in purple
[27:48] and scarlet colors decked with gold
[27:53] precious stones pearls and having a
[27:56] golden cup and a handful of abomination
[27:59] and the filthiness of her fornication
[28:02] and upon her name
[28:05] written mystery what and we know babylon
[28:09] was
[28:12] was that great city
[28:15] the never canal zoo
[28:18] it was a beautiful city it was a great
[28:21] city but
[28:22] the bible depicts her as
[28:26] babylon the great the mother of hollows
[28:29] and abomination of the earth
[28:34] we know that mr babylon
[28:40] is a city also
[28:43] and we realized that that that's where
[28:46] rome
[28:46] sits city on seven hills because he said
[28:49] the seven heads
[28:51] with our swords are the seven mountains
[28:54] in which the horde set it
[28:56] the whole represent the church
[29:00] are you with me so we realize that
[29:03] there's a
[29:04] church
[29:08] that he calls unhollowed
[29:14] sets upon many waters or waters
[29:16] represent people multitudes nations and
[29:18] tongues
[29:22] so we understand that it's deck with
[29:24] purple
[29:26] gold and precious stones we understand
[29:29] that
[29:31] so we understand that this woman which
[29:33] is type of the
[29:35] false church
[29:38] which produces
[29:42] daughters
[29:45] and we don't want to go in detail right
[29:47] now because we want to
[29:50] talk about
[29:54] the bride adorned for her husband
[30:00] we know that
[30:03] the false church
[30:08] we'll add to the word take away from the
[30:09] word
[30:13] and she'll have a lot of creeds and
[30:15] dogmas
[30:18] outside of the word
[30:22] and people will obey the wishes
[30:29] as it was in the old testament jezebel
[30:32] and atelier
[30:36] jezebel had a daughter named atelia
[30:42] so as it was an old in shadow form so it
[30:45] is in reality form
[30:46] as we see today brother and sister one
[30:50] day
[30:51] she'll raise her ugly head again
[30:58] but there must be a spirit that causes
[31:02] jezebel to be thrown out to wander like
[31:04] jehu
[31:08] that's anointing that exposes jezebel
[31:12] and her prophets baal
[31:16] so that was why elijah the prophet
[31:18] identifies
[31:19] who jezebel was
[31:23] and the same spirit of elijah would not
[31:25] identify
[31:26] who mystery babylon is
[31:32] so by the grace of god god has
[31:34] identified to you and i
[31:35] in this age
[31:39] that we might not be ignorant of satan
[31:43] devices
[31:45] and understand that we rather not
[31:46] against flesh and blood
[31:49] but against organized principalities and
[31:52] powers
[31:54] against the rulers of darkness of this
[31:55] world
[31:58] and we must be well equipped and well
[32:00] prepared
[32:01] amen to fight the good fight of faith
[32:03] that we might lay hold on eternal life
[32:10] we must put on the whole arm of god we
[32:13] must be adorned properly
[32:14] and knowing who we are adorning
[32:18] ourselves
[32:19] to meet the bridegroom
[32:22] are you with me it was very important
[32:26] as there were ten versions five are wise
[32:27] and father foolish it was very important
[32:30] that
[32:30] we had all it was very important that
[32:34] they were virgins they must be clean
[32:38] it's very important to you and i that if
[32:41] we're to marry
[32:43] christ then we must be clean we must be
[32:47] pure
[32:53] so revelation 17 depicts
[32:58] this unclean woman
[33:02] brothers and sisters i i i don't think
[33:04] it matters
[33:06] to some folks how they look
[33:09] when they go to meet god
[33:13] but it doesn't matter to the bride of
[33:15] jesus christ
[33:16] she must make sure
[33:19] and certain that she has on the prophet
[33:22] garment
[33:25] because remember one came in
[33:28] and didn't have a wedding coming on and
[33:30] they were just invited to the wedding
[33:32] and he said friend how did you get here
[33:36] so your garment and your adornment amen
[33:39] it's got to be right
[33:43] you must know what you ought to be
[33:45] dressed in
[33:48] let's go back to revelation 21
[33:51] and let's look again and i'll try
[33:54] to just get started for a moment
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] i think my best way of teaching is
[34:02] illustrating
[34:04] and i said i would have to do all kind
[34:06] of charts
[34:07] in order for you to see the clear
[34:09] picture
[34:12] but by the grace of god
[34:15] we must expect to see a clear picture of
[34:19] what god
[34:20] is requiring and what god wants about us
[34:24] see because we don't know what he wants
[34:27] then how can we know the bible said how
[34:30] can we heal without a preacher
[34:31] and how can he preach except he'd be sin
[34:35] or you would be and the bible says in
[34:38] the name of three seven shooters the
[34:40] lord god would do nothing but he reveals
[34:41] the secrets to serving the prophet
[34:46] so god amen sends us
[34:49] he meant a word of wisdom
[34:53] that we might be clothed
[34:56] and that we might not be found naked
[35:00] are you with me so god knows that the
[35:03] people would need
[35:05] the revealed word of the owl
[35:08] are you with me so the vibe will
[35:11] recognize your husband who he is
[35:14] are you up man
[35:18] so revelation 21 again it says in
[35:22] the second verse he says and i saw
[35:25] the holy city now we realize that mr
[35:29] babylon is a city too
[35:31] but i saw the holy city new jerusalem
[35:36] now you notice as we said in time past
[35:39] that the city is holy
[35:44] and the bible tells us that you are a
[35:46] city that sits on a hill
[35:48] that cannot be here amen
[35:53] let your light shine that men shall see
[35:55] your good works and glorify your father
[35:57] which is them
[35:59] are you with me so you are
[36:02] to be holy he said be holy because i
[36:06] am what holy and you're a city that sits
[36:10] on here that cannot be heard isn't that
[36:11] right
[36:14] so we must understand that as it is
[36:18] there will be a city
[36:22] but you must understand that god is
[36:25] expecting
[36:26] if any man be in christ jesus he is a
[36:28] new creature
[36:31] you must become a new creation anew
[36:35] amen and because amen
[36:39] you are the lights of the world or you
[36:42] would be
[36:43] so you light up in this dark evil wicked
[36:46] world
[36:47] god amen puts his light with the inside
[36:50] of you
[36:50] and you to shine
[36:54] are you with me and brother and sister
[36:57] if god puts his light in you
[36:59] you don't put it on the bushel
[37:02] praise god and i'm i'm so glad that
[37:07] you know the word of god is a laughing
[37:09] to my feet and light to my path
[37:13] if you've got the word of god in you
[37:15] it'll light you up
[37:18] they meant for it's like fire you shut
[37:20] up in my bone
[37:21] [Music]
[37:23] they meant the word of god
[37:27] amen would do something down in the
[37:29] inside
[37:31] it'll bring changes
[37:34] amen praise god i ain't got time i look
[37:37] like i'm gonna dub
