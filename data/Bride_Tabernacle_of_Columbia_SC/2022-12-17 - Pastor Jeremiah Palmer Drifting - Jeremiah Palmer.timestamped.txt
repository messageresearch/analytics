[30:11] [Music]
[30:14] have your Bibles turn with us to the
[30:16] Book of Revelation
[30:19] the second chapter
[30:34] [Music]
[30:41] Revelation 2
[30:46] very familiar
[30:48] text I know we have heard it so many
[30:50] times and I know even myself have maybe
[30:54] spoken it maybe not from the angle
[30:57] tonight that we want to try to work with
[31:00] it amen for a few minutes in Jesus
[31:03] Christ's name but Ephesians 2 and 1.
[31:11] it said the first verse said unto the
[31:13] angel of the Church of Ephesus
[31:17] write these things saith he that holdeth
[31:21] the Seven Stars in his right hand
[31:24] who walk it in the midst of the seven
[31:26] going in candlesticks
[31:29] I know that works in that labor and our
[31:32] patience how thou can is not bear them
[31:35] which are evil
[31:37] and that has tried them which say they
[31:40] are Apostles and are not and found them
[31:43] Liars has born in his patient and for my
[31:48] name's sake has labored and has not
[31:50] fainted
[31:51] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[31:54] thee because thou has left thy first
[31:57] love
[31:58] remember therefore from Winston falling
[32:01] and repent and do the first works or
[32:05] else I'll be coming to the quickly and
[32:08] we remove that Candlestick out of that
[32:10] place except thou repent
[32:13] father may you bless the word tonight
[32:16] God may you Quicken it in Jesus name we
[32:19] pray amen and be seated
[32:27] many of us I know are acquainted
[32:31] with
[32:33] the age of uh Ephesus
[32:40] and we are acquainted with
[32:43] what was going on
[32:47] if you remember that age which was the
[32:50] age that Paul was the messenger
[32:56] and Paul was
[32:59] uh
[33:02] setting that church or started off with
[33:05] the church
[33:07] with the things of God establishing them
[33:11] into faith
[33:13] in the word that God gave him for that
[33:16] particular generation
[33:19] and we understand
[33:21] that in that age
[33:25] the people were on fire for God
[33:29] they love the word
[33:31] of God that he had sent to them
[33:36] they kept the things that Paul were
[33:40] teaching
[33:43] and you know just like everywhere when
[33:47] God began to move the devil moved too
[33:52] and here uh
[33:55] this church here had a lot of things
[34:00] that was beginning to take place yet it
[34:04] was in little form
[34:07] it wasn't all so outward what was going
[34:11] on but it was hid
[34:14] it started out gradually
[34:17] until it began to fully manifest itself
[34:24] and I want you to understand that this
[34:27] was a spirit
[34:28] here that I'm working with here called
[34:30] the spirit of drifting or drifting
[34:33] uh and
[34:36] um we understand that uh that spirit is
[34:42] very much even real right now
[34:47] um we understand that these Spirits
[34:50] throughout the ages they started off uh
[34:55] like I said in a mile not all known
[34:59] and then from one age to the next it
[35:03] increased in it uh begin to show itself
[35:08] more and more in another form
[35:12] and this Spirit here I would say is it
[35:15] with the spirit of antichrist
[35:18] that begin to move in on this age here
[35:23] which the people and as God had
[35:26] commanded them you know that uh he know
[35:29] what they works and they labor and their
[35:31] patience so they will actually laboring
[35:35] for the things of God they were patient
[35:37] they they even were very keen to uh
[35:42] people that had crept in and began to uh
[35:48] cause them to get away from the things
[35:50] of God it's one place it said that uh
[35:53] they have some people that were saying
[35:56] they were Apostles and they said they
[35:59] tried them and found them to be Liars
[36:03] you know and it's always good cause
[36:05] about to say try the spirit
[36:08] and see river is God or not see and in
[36:13] Paul even wanted them even before the
[36:17] eight he said now after uh my departure
[36:21] he said the Grievous wolves were going
[36:23] to come in and begin to scatter the
[36:26] flock
[36:28] um and we noticed that this word of
[36:32] relaxing or drifting
[36:37] uh that's what that word the emphasis
[36:39] mean it means relaxing or or drifting
[36:43] and I looked up the word drifting and uh
[36:47] somebody said that it's a gradual
[36:52] shift
[36:54] not all at what what a gradual
[36:58] shift
[36:59] in Attitude
[37:02] opinion
[37:05] our position
[37:08] to vary or to deviate
[37:13] from a course see
[37:15] or
[37:17] adjustment in other words that they
[37:20] started aiming at God
[37:24] um they was focusing
[37:27] um on the things of God but did it it
[37:30] became a gradual shift
[37:34] in the people attitude in other words
[37:38] and we see that even now we're seeing a
[37:42] a gradual shift
[37:46] in people's attitude
[37:50] uh it don't even matter whether it
[37:52] didn't miss church no more
[37:56] but it wasn't all something like what
[37:58] but it came in a liberal form and you
[38:02] know you missed one and you know you
[38:05] missed two and and before you knew it
[38:07] you just become a Sunday or or just with
[38:11] a meeting is called you know but it was
[38:15] something that gradually
[38:18] and this is a spirit that comes into
[38:21] anoint us
[38:24] to get relaxed to get so comfortable
[38:28] that oh it'll be all right I'll do
[38:31] better after a while
[38:34] and then after after a while I'll leave
[38:41] we don't have the scrithing US
[38:45] uh that desire that you what has he
[38:52] that that desire for prayer
[38:56] desire to to heal from God to for God to
[39:01] speak and you hear the voice of God
[39:05] the love for God begin to you know get a
[39:10] little cold you know we're still coming
[39:12] to church and um we still like coming to
[39:15] church but it used to be a time there
[39:18] was a zeal
[39:20] there was a a fire of God that we
[39:25] couldn't wait
[39:27] until we get to the house of God
[39:31] but now it become within beginning to
[39:34] take it easy now in Zion
[39:37] see because we got more now
[39:41] we got better things and uh now we uh
[39:46] are now are doing much better than we
[39:50] used to naturally
[39:52] we got more than we ever had all of us
[39:55] do
[39:58] but yet even in that the things of God
[40:01] in our lives go like him
[40:04] the more of the world you we accumulate
[40:09] the less of God we begin to
[40:14] it is very hard to uh to a lot of times
[40:18] to get a balance
[40:21] you know there's nothing wrong with God
[40:23] blessing you with things
[40:26] but a lot of time those things begin to
[40:31] mean more to you
[40:34] because now you got a battle to keep
[40:37] them all
[40:41] and now it requires more of you
[40:46] it require more of your time that now I
[40:50] don't have to have time to pray like I
[40:52] used to
[40:54] I don't have time to really study and to
[40:58] seek God because I have a business
[41:02] schedule long way you're busy
[41:05] we are so busy busy busy people
[41:11] and yet we are just working ourself
[41:15] until we get sick
[41:18] now we need God to heal us
[41:24] you know they say whatever you put in is
[41:27] what you're going to get out
[41:30] but you know God is still good
[41:34] God Even in our ignorance to things and
[41:39] sometimes it's not it's our willfully
[41:42] do it
[41:44] because I know by now we'll we know
[41:48] better
[41:49] we have heard so much truth we've we've
[41:53] heard so many things that have been
[41:56] taught and we have heard so many
[41:58] preachers and teachers even the Sunday
[42:01] school and all those things but look
[42:04] like the more we hear the less we do
[42:09] and it's a spirit that that anoints the
[42:14] people to begin to back up
[42:19] from God
[42:22] from the things of God
[42:26] you know and that's what was happening
[42:29] in the age of Ephesus
[42:33] they got to a place that when these
[42:37] people kept in these apostles
[42:40] no doubt they begin to cause the people
[42:44] to get away from the word
[42:48] giving them maybe a substitute that you
[42:51] know it don't take quite all that no
[42:53] more
[42:55] that's what I used to hear a lot
[42:58] you know special when God you know had a
[43:03] standard that he's calling for
[43:07] and God don't change his standard for
[43:10] the match us we must change our standard
[43:13] to match God's standard
[43:16] and God sets a high standard it's a
[43:19] scrape and it's a narrow road
[43:24] not many gonna be able you know to stay
[43:27] on this road
[43:29] because it requires a sacrifice
[43:34] it requires you really knowing how much
[43:39] does it mean to me
[43:42] and what how much does God means to you
[43:45] how much do you value
[43:47] your soul
[43:50] can we afford
[43:53] to back go backwards
[43:56] I don't know about you but I don't have
[43:58] the time to
[43:59] it takes too much out of you to to go
[44:03] backwards
[44:04] and then trying to play catch-up
[44:08] you know it's something that you know
[44:11] sometimes people think they got time
[44:14] they got time to get it together
[44:17] sister and brother the time is now
[44:20] the time is now that we really examine
[44:24] our own self you know and look at
[44:27] ourselves in the mirror of the word and
[44:30] begin to say Lord help me
[44:34] and you can feel you know our spirit the
[44:38] driftingness
[44:39] the comfortableness
[44:42] the less passion
[44:45] your love for God like you used to
[44:49] you know some say one place say take me
[44:52] back
[44:53] to the old landmark
[44:56] you know how it used to be a time that
[45:00] the people of God uh would really make
[45:04] sacrifices because they didn't want to
[45:07] miss anything that God is doing
[45:11] there used to be time they sell you know
[45:14] that I used to get off of work early
[45:17] we used to going up back on truck
[45:21] to go to the meetings
[45:23] pack up all of our children
[45:26] and go to the services not even ever
[45:29] have enough money but we ate sandwich
[45:32] bologna sandwich and cheese
[45:35] but we were happy we were going to hear
[45:38] something from God
[45:41] it doesn't matter you know what you
[45:43] rolled in or what you had that that
[45:46] didn't even matter to us the only thing
[45:48] matter Lord we want you
[45:52] and that's all it auto matters now the
[45:55] more God blessing you the humble you
[45:58] should be
[45:59] the more you have naturally you're going
[46:02] to say Lord now I can do more for you
[46:07] but what do we do
[46:10] we drift the way we become cold starchy
[46:15] less concerned
[46:18] about our own soul with less concerned
[46:22] about
[46:23] what it really takes to keep us on fire
[46:31] what does it really take
[46:34] to keep us with a Zeal for God
[46:38] because I know all of us sit down get a
[46:41] little Slack
[46:43] but you have to pinch yourself
[46:47] you have to really know that uh the
[46:51] devil is not playing now
[46:53] we are fighting demonic powers and the
[46:57] servant of God say that you know the
[46:59] devil waiting for that knockout punch
[47:03] that place you get to where
[47:06] you know a lot of people especially
[47:09] nowadays you never tell me Mary that you
[47:12] know you're on a thin line you are just
[47:16] walking a very close line for the devil
[47:19] how can you read all out
[47:24] as I heard the servant of God was saying
[47:26] he said you know as hard as he preached
[47:29] against things and sin and thing he said
[47:32] when they come back the people get worse
[47:38] spiritual drifting
[47:41] and it's hard for us to uh to really
[47:45] understand
[47:48] um what your Zeal for God means to you
[47:53] until you lose it
[47:57] and when you lose that fire in that zeal
[48:01] I don't know about you but it makes me
[48:04] very uncomfortable
[48:07] because you know I want to feel the
[48:09] presence of God
[48:12] you know I just don't want that
[48:14] anointing God to lift up off of me and I
[48:17] just walk and begin to do anything
[48:20] say anything go anywhere
[48:24] it doesn't matter whether I do it
[48:26] doesn't matter even what nobody say
[48:30] about me
[48:32] because I'm gonna do my own thing
[48:36] and I'm afraid you know yes you can do
[48:39] your own thing
[48:42] but when you wake up
[48:45] and find out y'all thinking thought
[48:47] about Sampson you know how he started
[48:51] out
[48:51] destroying Philistine because that's
[48:54] what God raised him up to do
[48:57] to destroy the Philistines and
[49:00] then after a while something you know he
[49:03] had a job on his ass that he killed a
[49:06] thousand
[49:07] he had a lot of Victories and a lot of
[49:10] God was with samps I mean destroying his
[49:13] intimacy
[49:15] but the council got to a place that he
[49:18] played around
[49:21] with his salvation
[49:24] he played around with with one of the
[49:27] Philistines that he should have had
[49:29] destroyed
[49:32] he he just flew around just with one of
[49:35] them
[49:37] and that one
[49:40] was responsible for taking him out
[49:46] because see the devil knew Samson
[49:49] weakness
[49:52] and no doubt he stood himself and he
[49:55] studied us
[49:58] to find out your weak areas
[50:02] how can I take that Joy you got
[50:06] uh what can I give you to replace it
[50:12] the way it becomes more to you than God
[50:15] does
[50:18] everybody you want to replace give you a
[50:21] substitute
[50:23] for God and most that it'd be
[50:26] worldliness
[50:29] more here less there
[50:34] and you prosper naturally oh you're
[50:37] doing good naturally
[50:40] but where's your prayer life
[50:44] where is the presence of God
[50:48] oh my consecration
[50:51] you know it's hard to get people to
[50:54] consecrate
[50:55] your flesh don't even want to do it
[50:59] you have to battle your own flesh
[51:03] they even get breakthroughs in prayer
[51:06] that need answering and people need
[51:09] Deliverance
[51:11] it's sad that we come to church bound
[51:14] with problems and we leave the same way
[51:18] come on this ought to be a place where
[51:21] the power of God
[51:23] ought to be here
[51:25] but you're the one got to bring it
[51:28] we want the preacher to death
[51:32] preacher you pray you pray you pray but
[51:37] how about us
[51:40] were we gonna start dropping the Lord on
[51:43] the pastors
[51:45] I'm understanding that now
[51:48] and it shouldn't be you and I the people
[51:51] of God yes I know you got condition yet
[51:56] we got them too
[52:00] but it's something about it we have to
[52:03] press our way through
[52:05] the brother go out and sing that song
[52:07] yes you have to press your way through
[52:11] ain't nobody gonna be able to do it for
[52:13] your sister brother
[52:16] not depressed you have to
[52:18] forever
[52:20] and ground you want to get
[52:24] there used to be a time we could say
[52:25] come on come on y'all
[52:29] and God had mercy
[52:31] but now he leave it up there each and
[52:35] every one of us
[52:37] to get desperate and begin to cry out
[52:41] God I need you
[52:47] but
[52:49] as I say they never know how to give us
[52:51] something
[52:52] to substitute
[52:55] what we really need
[52:58] we always think we need more of this and
[53:01] more of that
[53:03] that might be what you want what you
[53:05] need is God
[53:07] you're gonna find out all these
[53:10] materialistic things that we label so
[53:13] hard to get
[53:15] and y'all know when you get it guess
[53:16] what it don't mean no more to you
[53:19] not even got to find something else you
[53:21] want
[53:23] it is just material but come on Bible
[53:26] says seek ye first
[53:31] come on seek God first in everything
[53:34] else to be added
[53:38] but we seek Earthly and then we forget
[53:42] about the spiritually
[53:44] and then we find ourselves like Samson
[53:48] Samson the Philistines upon thee
[53:53] and he played with Delilah too many
[53:56] times
[53:58] we play around with the devil too many
[54:01] times we occupy ourselves we do it
[54:06] because you got a choice that you can
[54:08] make
[54:10] and remember this the choice you make
[54:12] now is going to have an effect on you
[54:15] later
[54:16] so the choice that you make sister
[54:19] brother examine that by God's word
[54:23] be sure Lord is this your will for me or
[54:28] is the devil trying to give me a
[54:30] substitute
[54:34] children lives and
[54:37] getting them all messed up and Tangled
[54:40] Up
[54:43] and the deal with the slow walking
[54:46] he didn't know her either
[54:49] he's a slow walking has given us a
[54:51] little this
[54:52] in a little that
[54:55] you know and I think we ought to thank
[54:57] God for everything that God does for us
[55:01] but sister and brother
[55:03] if that thing that whatever you're
[55:04] getting is taking you away from God
[55:08] it ain't worth it
[55:11] I know you might say I needed your
[55:12] brother Jeremiah let me tell you
[55:14] something you're gonna need God more
[55:16] than you need any kind of money
[55:19] and we are going to find out I believe
[55:22] it's happening we're going to find out
[55:24] that your money
[55:25] can't heal you
[55:28] when you're going through a crisis
[55:31] and you being been bonded by demon
[55:34] powers
[55:35] your status in this life
[55:39] is not going to be able to get you out
[55:42] of that situation you're going to have
[55:45] to know your God
[55:48] as I said Simpson played around
[55:52] he started out
[55:54] three times
[55:57] playing with her playing with the
[55:59] playing with
[56:00] did the bible say that she vexed his
[56:03] soul
[56:06] in other words she would have determined
[56:08] to find out what whether it was a spirit
[56:11] that had noted her
[56:13] and these Spirits can get strong
[56:18] they can bombarded you so that where you
[56:21] know it gets so bad that we'll fake
[56:24] actually that is God
[56:28] but still some drifted drifted so until
[56:31] he told her
[56:33] his secret
[56:37] and when he told her
[56:41] she called for the Philistine to come in
[56:45] and what did he do they plucked his eyes
[56:48] out
[56:50] so he could no longer see the revelation
[56:52] of the word for his hour
[56:55] he knew what he was called to do but he
[56:58] allowed the devil to scrip it
[57:03] what did he use his weakness
[57:07] what are you like what do you really
[57:09] really want more than God watch The
[57:12] Devil bring it to you
[57:15] and the very thing he loved with the
[57:18] very thing that destroyed him
[57:26] cut his hair his loss
[57:30] cut his power off
[57:33] that's what the devil do cut your power
[57:35] off
[57:37] cut your revelation of the word off
[57:42] the way you are not even bathing in the
[57:46] word and getting the inspiration from
[57:49] God anymore all you can do is work
[57:53] and gain here
[57:57] but the time that you used to spit
[58:01] listening and reading the word the
[58:04] servant of God say if you want a closer
[58:06] walk with God he said read your Bible
[58:09] every day and pray
[58:13] wow
[58:15] read your Bible
[58:17] every day and pray
[58:21] it is hard to do
[58:24] to do those things
[58:26] because we got so much to occupy that
[58:33] to sit down
[58:36] middle
[58:38] by little see drifting a gradual
[58:43] shift
[58:45] in the attitude the way you're thinking
[58:48] about things
[58:49] the way you thinking you know sometimes
[58:52] we always look across the aisle well
[58:54] they're doing it what I got to do with
[58:56] you
[58:58] come on you can't let what other people
[59:00] do affect how God wants to deal with you
[59:05] you got to understand it's you and God
[59:09] you're not going to get anything because
[59:12] of what but the earnest about the
[59:13] Jeremiah Joshua Simmons do know you're
[59:17] gonna have to know God for yourself
[59:21] because if we decide we ain't gonna go
[59:23] no more what's going to happen to you
[59:27] and a lot of times
[59:29] we see that
[59:32] people rely on what others do
[59:36] but if you are an example follow Jesus
[59:41] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[59:46] see we got an example but we take any
[59:49] other example the next church that this
[59:52] preacher that this is here no follow
[59:55] Jesus
[59:58] what did he do
[1:00:02] come on he was homeless
[1:00:05] he had nowhere to lay his head
[1:00:08] now he had a right like everybody else
[1:00:10] to have a house they have a family they
[1:00:13] have things but no
[1:00:16] because he want to be touched by the
[1:00:18] feeling of our infirmity
[1:00:22] he was God
[1:00:25] oh
[1:00:26] he was guarding flesh
[1:00:29] yet the things of this world he didn't
[1:00:32] want to build a castle he could have had
[1:00:36] but no he was more concerned that I'm
[1:00:40] your example
[1:00:42] if you don't have this if you don't have
[1:00:44] that that's all right just give me Jesus
[1:00:52] you get everything so nicely here get
[1:00:54] everything so together here
[1:00:57] at the servant of God you know we're
[1:00:59] looking at Billy Graham and Uncle
[1:01:00] Roberts and he got a little touch
[1:01:02] sometimes you know the devil trying to
[1:01:04] anoint you himself why I can't have it
[1:01:07] and God said look up
[1:01:10] we're not scribing for things here
[1:01:13] because this is not our home
[1:01:15] we're just passing through our screen
[1:01:17] we're using these things temporarily
[1:01:20] you know but what we are actually
[1:01:22] looking for
[1:01:24] oh my
[1:01:26] God oh well what are we looking for
[1:01:27] scrapes of gold
[1:01:31] come on something you don't have to
[1:01:32] worry about paying for anymore
[1:01:35] not even their taxes
[1:01:38] you don't have to worry about these uh
[1:01:41] economical things that we so wrapped
[1:01:44] ourselves into
[1:01:46] let's see here brother Carol say a lot
[1:01:48] you say you know it's okay to have good
[1:01:52] thing but just don't let the good thing
[1:01:53] get you
[1:01:55] see the good house the good car the good
[1:01:58] living
[1:01:59] you know those things sometimes mean
[1:02:02] more
[1:02:03] to us than God does
[1:02:07] because Robert said where your heart is
[1:02:09] that's where your treasure
[1:02:12] see in in our heart there are certain
[1:02:15] things there
[1:02:18] and you have to know
[1:02:20] and sometimes God has to bring it out
[1:02:24] what could I give you
[1:02:28] so you don't walk away from me
[1:02:32] what can I actually substitute
[1:02:36] I want me to make you more happier as I
[1:02:39] hear people say I'm so happy
[1:02:42] you left God and you happy
[1:02:46] and I said Lord help them
[1:02:50] you left the presence and the things of
[1:02:53] God and you are more happier
[1:02:58] and you can't get mad with them because
[1:03:00] maybe that's far they could go with it
[1:03:04] see because whatever is in US God's
[1:03:08] gonna bring it out
[1:03:11] and it's gradually
[1:03:13] that's why we see the great falling away
[1:03:16] did it just follow it all of a sudden it
[1:03:20] took years
[1:03:22] years and then boom
[1:03:25] Lord have mercy boom
[1:03:28] people that we looked up to and people
[1:03:31] that we had a lot of respect for and I'm
[1:03:34] not saying downcast but Lord have mercy
[1:03:38] because I don't be I don't be happy
[1:03:40] because of somebody fall I pray God for
[1:03:43] mercy on them
[1:03:45] because that's not our attitude to wish
[1:03:48] somebody don't make it
[1:03:51] no I want even my enemy to make it
[1:03:57] but let me tell you I can't
[1:03:59] afford to take my eyes off of the prize
[1:04:06] I can't afford to
[1:04:09] um go backwards
[1:04:13] it's too late now
[1:04:19] server got here was saying here that he
[1:04:22] said now the fervent desire
[1:04:25] to please God the passion to know his
[1:04:29] word to cry for reaching out in the
[1:04:32] spirit all begins to fade
[1:04:36] in the state of the church be on fire
[1:04:39] with the fire of God it cooled off and
[1:04:42] become formal
[1:04:45] now Lord they still were coming to
[1:04:47] church they still was singing a song
[1:04:50] but no it was a form of godliness
[1:04:54] but denying the power he said this that
[1:04:58] they were getting a bit formal the
[1:05:00] abandonment to God was dying out
[1:05:03] and the people weren't too careful about
[1:05:06] what God thought of them and they began
[1:05:09] to be careful about what the world
[1:05:12] thought
[1:05:13] of them
[1:05:14] see and that's how it gives a lot of
[1:05:16] times
[1:05:31] pouring out
[1:05:34] getting more
[1:05:37] living better
[1:05:43] doing things I always want to do in my
[1:05:46] whole life
[1:05:49] don't even know that thing is sucking
[1:05:51] you
[1:05:53] prayer life began to fade
[1:05:58] we get so loose
[1:06:03] certain the Bible hand said he said now
[1:06:05] he said we have he said call it he
[1:06:08] called them back
[1:06:11] see God ain't gave up God's solid
[1:06:14] condition God said repent
[1:06:18] and do your first works
[1:06:21] don't stay in that condition
[1:06:28] because you got an opportunity to do
[1:06:30] something about your situation
[1:06:34] you got to do something about it
[1:06:36] God gave them a space to repent he give
[1:06:40] us a space to repent
[1:06:43] closing of another year where are we at
[1:06:48] where are we really at
[1:06:50] I just was trying to treat them I seen
[1:06:52] them what we really need I believe you
[1:06:56] know every homeless trust said what we
[1:06:58] really did he said we need a fully
[1:07:01] surrendered dedication to come back to
[1:07:04] God again
[1:07:08] because we all had gotten Slack
[1:07:11] and any time passed we might have got
[1:07:13] away with it
[1:07:15] let me tell you something it gonna take
[1:07:17] more
[1:07:19] it gonna take more next year than we did
[1:07:21] this year
[1:07:24] but we got to start right now
[1:07:27] and that's just each individual you got
[1:07:31] to make us don't worry about what
[1:07:33] everybody else is doing
[1:07:36] because sometimes we measure ourselves
[1:07:38] by others the Bible say that's not wise
[1:07:41] you want to marry yourself go to the god
[1:07:44] of word
[1:07:45] and look in and say Lord here am I
[1:07:49] you know me Lord
[1:07:52] I backslid I went back with God but Lord
[1:07:56] help me
[1:07:58] show me what I need to do Lord
[1:08:02] and the first thing he said repent first
[1:08:05] acknowledge it
[1:08:08] did cry out
[1:08:12] as Samson did when Delilah
[1:08:15] thought she had Samson the devil's going

[1:10:43] song says when the storm of light was
[1:10:45] raging
[1:10:47] praise God
[1:10:51] I thank God for the word tonight how
[1:10:54] about you
[1:10:57] so many folks are passing away
[1:11:01] so many of my classmates and uh
[1:11:05] people that we grew up with is just
[1:11:07] passing
[1:11:09] every week there's two or three passing
[1:11:13] life is short
[1:11:16] if you live a little while you realize
[1:11:18] how short this life is and
[1:11:20] whatever you're gonna do you can do it
[1:11:22] for Christ
[1:11:24] because everything else won't matter
[1:11:26] after a while
[1:11:28] you may be young you may be old or
[1:11:30] whatever
[1:11:34] as I said the prophet of God said the
[1:11:36] question is going to be asked one day
[1:11:38] what did you do with the life that I
[1:11:40] gave you
[1:11:43] what did you do with the life that Jesus
[1:11:45] gave you
[1:11:46] we spent it all on us we were selfish
[1:11:50] it's just like the man with the talent I
[1:11:52] bury it
[1:11:53] spent it all on me
[1:11:59] I believe that God wants
[1:12:02] us to give back what he gave us
[1:12:05] are you with me
[1:12:09] God gives you life give you health give
[1:12:12] you strength he wants you to give it
[1:12:13] back to him
[1:12:15] that's the most important thing in life
[1:12:21] seek ye first
[1:12:25] a member of Bishop R L Davis the Lord
[1:12:27] Lord sister singing first time I heard
[1:12:30] seek seek Him First seek me first
[1:12:34] and that was it was powerful then
[1:12:37] seeking me first

[1:12:48] seek me for she could sing it
[1:12:51] and I believe we need to seek God first
[1:12:54] nothing else that we do in life all our
[1:12:57] plans all are nothing else if you don't
[1:13:00] if we don't have God it ain't gonna mean
