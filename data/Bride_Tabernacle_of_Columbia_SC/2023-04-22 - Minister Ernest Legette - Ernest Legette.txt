lives and Lord I pray that you would do so tonight Lord thank you Lord we love you we appreciate you for all your goodness and kindness towards us father for we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Hebrews tonight by the grace of God Hebrews 3. very familiar scripture God is good amen Hebrews 3 try not to be for you long tonight we want to minister on holding fast the confidence amen and a sub-topic the witness holding fast the confidence with a subtopic of the witness Hebrews 3 by the grace of God he got it tonight Say Amen and it reads wherefore our holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high Priests of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him also as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses as much as he who hath build it the house had more honor than the house you may be seated I'ma read a little further down for every house is built it by some man but he that built all things is God Amen I like that says every house was builted by some man but he that built all things is God we were saying the other night in in the Bible study that you know we served this great God don't we God I says that sometimes you can go out and look into certain uh creations of nature we call it Creations but certain things of Nature and and it just odds you or looks at you and it just makes you feel a certain way within yourself because then you know you look at it and it makes you feel like you you may be this big and then you think about you know the little statue that you are and how great the God is that created these things it says that he that created all things as God so you sometimes you you have those moments and then God you know you feel just how small you are compared to how great God is and you know it looks like it's it's sometimes a big gap between you and God in which it is his Holiness and righteousness his thoughts is not our thoughts his ways are not always right they're higher than us but yet even in that one of the great things about God is he knows how to condense sin he knows how to come down you know from off of that place where he is and come down to the oppressed come down to the the meek and the lowly come down to those that that are in need of them and that's what that's the Glorious thing about God he that sitting so high got that ability to come and and be so low ain't your thing ain't you thankful for that tonight amen so God is so good he says that he that built all things of God and Moses was very rarely faithful in all his house as a servant for the testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast to confidence and the and the rejoicing of the Hope firm Until the End remember we talking about holding fast the confidence now he says that we are part of God's house if we hold fast the confidence and be firm steadfast firm until what Until the End right because it doesn't matter some people can run years and years and years but he says you'll you'll make up that house of God now you partakers you'll be part of his house if you hold fast until the end come on until the end until like they said you give up the ghost or until God calls your name you know you don't know when God gonna going to call you a wing god gonna take you but nevertheless you holding fast you're holding it you're holding come on you know you say you're holding because sometimes you know not within yourself if you've been born again you got the desire and the will to please God and to serve God but you know to give God all that he he desires are all out of your life sometimes the the pressures of life or the the cares of this world will choke things out of you Jesus even talked about that make you become unfruitful so sometimes it's oppressed to get out and give God all that he wants out your life buddy so you said you holding fast you holding firm you know you have those little shakes or little moments but you're holding it you're holding fast until the what until the end and I want to say tonight even if I get ahead of myself tonight no matter what hold fast to the end you know and that's what it is the the very the very beginning of your Christian Journey got to be right it got to be right if the beginning ain't right the house gonna fall you know they talk about building a house you can't build a house from the top up you can't build a roof first you got to start at the foundation and the foundation got to be right it can't be any kind of foundation you know you look at uh some areas of the country just because of the the geographical place of the country certain uh foundations might not work or they have to add certain uh additives to the mix of the concrete or whatever like that you know uh I forget what they call accelerators and stuff and some of it because of just in the air they got certain chemicals in the air just off of the ocean and all these things so you know you might have to make a little mix you know a little different for this atmosphere versus this atmosphere but nevertheless you the foundation has to be built right for the atmosphere that it's going to be in so it's because if it isn't that house might be built and it might last 20 years and you might not see up under it it's already starting a road it's already starting to get weak you know and next thing you know the the structure just fall all apart it didn't just fall all apart overnight it been working itself away is just that the time came now that the right weight got on it or the time came now that the right wind blew and destroyed the house destroyed the structure come on because it all it being started it ain't just starting that's what you see even in Christian lives people just just throw their hands up walk away just it but it didn't just happen overnight it started somewhere that they lost the confidence they lost that that steadfastness they lost it you know or the foundation from the beginning wasn't built right they didn't stay long enough to get filled up you know you know and it's important to be filled up not just to be on the surface but to be filled up you know David I don't believe it was just by coincidence in the Scriptures it says you know he said my cup running over I got enough got I got more enough I'm filled up to the brim there's no more room in the cup and that cup run over that's because there's no more room in there it's filled up to the brim because you know and that's what it is I said God I want you to the the engulf my life don't let leave no room for nothing because you know if there's room for the enemy to come in he gonna find he'll take that little bit of area or whatever you give them he'll take that little bit and he'll come in there don't don't give the devil no room let God have it occupied a whole house let God occupy everything and then he'll he'll come in and he'll do the work y'all believe that tonight you know so I says though so you got to be it's got to be built right you know it's got to be built right or like I said the the any the wind will blow house fall apart it didn't just start and it says you look at lives and that's why sometimes we stir up that that old man that's inside you like they say y'all believe that tonight so we said holding fast like it says here holding fast firm I mean rejoicing of the Hope firm Until the End wherefore as the Holy Ghost says today if you would hear his voice hard not your hearts as in provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempting me prove me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren blessed by lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God you know unbelief causes you depart from life he says an evil heart of unbelief is I want you to take heed lest there be any in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God we don't want to depart from a living God you know people still go to church but they they're not they've departed from the Living God they've erred from the faith they go to church but the god they serve is a painted fire they partner departed from them but what it is like we're saying the other night you know you serve this great God this Supernatural God and he still has Miracles he still works miracles signs and wonders and you got to expect them you got to look for them you got the long form you got the and that's what it is that's what all of these like we say trials and temptations and things are about to stir up because sometimes I say as you know like like we says tonight holding fast to confidence I want to ask the question what makes a man lose confidence in God what makes a man lose that that confidence that he had or that confidence they started out with what makes a man lose it I said is it because that he that God has failed him so many times they lost confidence in God but God is not a man that he should lie everything that God said he'll bring it to pass and and no matter nothing nothing wants him to stop God from or be able to hinder him except for your unbelief come on but but when God said something you can rest on us to settle Thy word oh Lord is settle forever is settled you can rest on it I say what causes a man to lose his confidence in God is it because God failed I like how God told Joshua I won't fail you you know we always talk about the Forsaken part but I like that part I won't fail you nothing won't hold God up from keeping his promises no matter what it looks like nothing won't hold God up So I says that what causes a man to lose his confidence is it that God failed him so many times or is it sometimes that everything is so accessible so already accessible that you know he has no need for that desperate he has no need to get in desperation he has no need to really call on God or to be in prayer mode because desperation ain't there right so what happens is you know when that when that uh like we talk about those five senses when they lie dormant and you don't use them it may not been nothing wrong with them from the beginning but it's set up too long you didn't use them and now when you go to use them they don't work right I made an example the other day of a car like you set it up might sit up two three years out in the yard you know and you parked it there and it might have not been nothing wrong with it but after that long time you gonna try to crank it up and it ain't gonna run everything gonna have to be changed out battery motor locked up all that sometimes it won't even be repairable because it sat up so long and sometimes you know what's the what's the like they say the need to have faith when when uh nothing's really going on wrong Richie sometimes you don't never really reach out because you say I don't have the need to is what you say but not realizing you use Faith every day it took Faith to get here to church tonight it took faith for you to get up out the bed and walk to the bathroom this morning it took Faith you're using it sometimes unconsciously but to to to um what what God does I believe sometimes is he'll shake the like we said he put He put a stop to the show he'll shake things up a little bit to do what to get your confidence back up we get your your attention to get you to turn and begin to look to him a little more because you know the Bible says there'll be rich increase with goods and have need or what nothing they had lost they they don't have need or nothing but then God ain't gonna let you or not because we're his children he ain't gonna let us get to that point the way we have need or nothing he gonna let everything fail us to where we say God I know I need you I need all of you God I need your healing I need your I need your finances Lord I need you in every area of my life God I need you so he allow those things I come to that uh place in my life to understand that everything God does everything for a reason God is working on me like like I said I'm gonna start saying God is working on me pray for me God is working on me he's he's working something out because that's what he's doing it's somewhere along the line I wasn't looking at him like I used to so he allows something to happen the way I can look to him and say God I need your help I need you Lord I'm sorry I I I I I hear you I need your help I hear what you're saying God I need your help and that's what God want to get us to y'all believe that tonight so I said hold past the confidence what caused a man to lose that confidence and a lot of times you know as I said because sometimes everything is accessible and he has he has no need of that's what we say but not knowing that you need God every day it ain't a day that you wake up and you don't need God it ain't the day you wake up and you can do things on your own you try to convince people that it ain't a day you wake up and you don't need God it ain't one hour you can say you don't need them come on and when you when you I will say in the other night that uh how you know when a person has really went into the presence of God it says I said you can't go into the presence of God and come out the same it's impossible it's impossible for a man to really go into the presence of God and come back the same as what he was I said what it is his spiritual change you know I think about I think it was Isaiah said Lord he said woe is me you know when he got closer to that light didn't he because then he might have knew he had a little gift and all these things but the closer he got to that light he began to see how unclean he was and how wretched he was and how insufficient he was and how you know how great God was and how far fact she was but that's why that's why he says that when he's talking about righteousness he says your righteousness is as what filthy rags don't come to me saying what you've done like I owe you anything I don't owe you nothing I'm only giving it to you by my grace you didn't choose me but I chose you and that's what God sometimes have to remind the people of and I thank God I thank God because if he would have gave it up to us in our choice many of us wouldn't have chosen but when he knew he knew that one day we desired we would desire want to do right but I thank God for for predestination that he chose you come on the prophet of God in one place he said God he you he had you in his mind and when you came to a certain place into the world he said God recognized you he saw you and he recognized you because you were in his mind and he began to call in on you right because God recognized you and I'm so glad that God recognized me many times you look at certain uh uh uh uh things in your life way God brought you from and all these things I said but God recognized me oh I had something going on that I didn't know about myself but this was God's doing this ain't like said Israel doing but this is God's doing this is the work that God is doing and no man can't stop it and I thank God for it tonight don't you think ain't you thankful for that tonight but it says that don't lose don't lose that confidence hold fast come on hold fast there's a lot of things today that'll cause you to lose confidence ain't it or or not really lose confidence in God I said you can't lose confidence in God now no matter what you ever you ever been in God ever you ever been into that place your testimony is right that if God don't never do nothing else he already done enough I don't see not one more Miracle my testimony is sold out until the day that God take me away from here he already did enough it's he already did enough he already he approved himself like he says here in the scriptures don't be like them to where they proved me and tested me and I I did it and they still didn't believe me don't be like that but I says that God did enough already that no matter what comes today or tomorrow if I don't never hear his voice again I know he's out there somewhere come on he's already proved himself he's already proved who he was and I'm standing firm on that because God I know that your word Can't Fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but your word won't pass away and that's what I'm resting on that's what I'm going down in Hallelujah and that word inside of you like it says that no man can go into that presence of God and ever be the same he gonna come out in his speech gonna be different he ain't gonna talk about what he could do and what he capable of because when you go in that presence you know that like Christ said without me you can't do nothing come on the life is in the is in the vine and you are the branches the life is in you right I I always tell the testimony I've seen someone one time they look like they were asleep but they were dead and and you know nobody knew right away I guess but look like they just looked like I seen the The Life just leave out of them it looked like it looked like they just just the breath just left out of them and I say is that you know what that's what that's what happens but nevertheless we got to understand that that breath you taking that was God allows you to do that that you doing God did that God allowed on it right God doing it's his power hovering over you you know he make his Reign it rained on the just and unjust the unbelievers don't want to recognize him but he's still good to them too now he's long suffering is what he is come on that's what he is he long suffering but I says that oh our eyes has been open and we see God for who he is and we thankful that's why we praise him no man once you went into that presence and you come back no man don't have to force you to praise God no no man I have to tell you to have the the be glad when they said you come into the house the Lord no man I have to tell you that no man I have to tell you that that you need to put God first because you've been in that presence and you know who he is no man I'll tell you that you ought to be thankful to him no man will tell you that no man would have to tell you hey y'all you ought to be well I guess I no no you've been in that prison no man I have to tell you that you'll come back a change individual you'll come back thanking God for another day come back thanking God for his glory and his grace that you couldn't obtain it but Christ has obtained it for us and by him obtaining it he come down and freely give it to us Hallelujah you ain't worth it but God went the distance came down off his throne born in a manger to live in this crooked world that came to it didn't even want him rejected him sometimes you think about oh the world don't like you look what they did to Jesus look what they did to him but yet he endured all that didn't he the Bible says he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief that great God that created all these things that great God hallelujah that you know some men build houses but all things are built by God that great God come on came down and got in a body didn't he because he was once God above us but he wanted to be tangible he wanted to be Emmanuel God With Us I want to be touched by what they're going through I want to feel the pain they feel I want to feel the rejection and the hurt so when they come to me I could say I know what you're going through I've been through it press you can make it he was the first fruit wasn't he he went the distance to show you Hallelujah he left no stone unturned he defeated the enemy he said he rose with all power didn't he and that's what it is God's got all power so when the enemy comes remember he's a Bluff trying to get you off that stand of Faith because he don't have no power wolfing talking in your ear Christ has got all the power devil he don't whip you his blood was shed and his power in his blood come on he rose with the keys not only did he defeat uh everything in this life for us but he defeated death doubt was your enemy but he defeated death for you that even when you go down you don't have to be afraid to die but you can be like Paul and said oh uh oh death whereas I sting oh grave where is thy victory it ain't me but if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwells in you come on not what church you go to family all those things but the Holy Ghost if it dwells in you that's the life this body might be dead but life is still in you Hallelujah one day he called your name and that life comes about something quick in you and you come back I believe that oh I believe that with all of my heart come on God is so good come on a lot of people don't believe that you know that a lot of people sit in church and don't believe that you know they'll do it amen it all that but in their heart they don't believe it because how can you believe in the resurrection from the dead but don't believe in Divine Healing can't believe in that without one not believing out any other right come on but nevertheless God is changing us from glory to glory he allows us to go through these things that's why I said God is working things out he let them go in the wilderness he let them go in there and knew where he was leading them that it wasn't going to be no water God knew that didn't he but he also knew that he could give them water in those places come on ask God God I want water he already know I'm leading you the way I'm leaving you ain't got no water he know that but he also knew that he was a Creator some men build houses but the one that built everything is God he knowed that didn't he so but he led them by that way anyway and give him water give him bread give me whatever you want I want to show you that the land might look Barren but I'm God Almighty I remember when Abraham in the scriptures were so old and God began to tell him he says he says I'm God come on he says a walk before me and be thou perfect and he began to tell them is there anything too hard for the Lord come on I'm Mighty God I'm almighty God you just walk before me and be perfect I want to show you that those things that's dead I'll bring them back to life again and I know he can I seen him do it and that's showing he's the same yesterday today and forever yes he is God is he's the same yesterday today and forever he said I am he that wish was and and it was not and it is to come I am him come on the Alfred Omega the beginning and the ending come on I didn't change nothing for my statue I am that I am call on me I didn't change time has changed but I never changed I'm still that God Almighty and I believe it he's showing it to us ain't it he proven it to us all the time Hallelujah but like it says you can't go in that presence think about that a man can't go on that President come back and be the same it's impossible for a man to do that but we find here it says harder not your hearts in the averse as in the day in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me improved me and saw my words 40 years where I was agreed with that generation let's drop down to the fifth verse it says while it is said today if ye will hear his voice hard not your hearts as in propagation he says today if you will hear his voice there's a lot of voices out there there's a lot of them out there but if you'll hear his voice today some you got to hear his voice through all the noise through all of the crowd through all of the confusion you got to still be able to hear God's voice it tried all this stuff tries to drown out God's voice but God's voice is still out there and it's still calling that's why he says that he that hath an ear let him hear come on because his voice is still out there the noise is trying to drown it out the things are trying to drown it out like it says a lot of times when something is really going on they'll create a diversion on the media and I believe that to try to drown out what take you away from what's really taking place you know you'll have some major things going on but then they'll have something on on the news about some some marriages broke up or or something like that or some football players gambling maybe they'll they'll have something like that when major things are taking place and then they'll have to do what to tune you away from the signs of the times but nevertheless you and I got ears to hear we got eyes to see we can't be divert nothing don't divert Us in tune we can't be tuned away because our tune is just like Elisha when he was following Elijah they said you know your master getting taken away today he said I know but hold your peace come on everywhere he went tried to get distracted but he said no hold your peace come on because it was things were trying to distract them I believe that even when Elijah says well if you see me when I go you know like we said I would have been afraid to Blink that's how in tune you had to be because if I didn't see him when he go I'm going to miss something great I'm gonna miss that double portion I'm gonna miss that power imma miss the thing that I've been following them for long and for imagining Elijah Alicia would have been following him all that time and then got there to a place to where he says okay well I'll just quit now you followed him all that time but you didn't endure to the end you didn't hold fast your confidence to the end so you missed it come on but he held to the end didn't he and then when he caught that mantle Hallelujah did he realize yes Elijah has gone up but the god of Elijah is still here he's still here to do the same things come on and we got confidence in him the man is gone but God is still here come on and I got confidence in him he's still doing the same things Hallelujah I believe it with all of my heart what he says here in the in the 16th verse for some when they heard did provoke how be it not all came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcass fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of what unbelief now we know they did a lot of things right he said but they couldn't enter in because of unbelief right he said the the unbelief the sin of unbelief all the things he says we see that the reason why they couldn't enter in was because of unbelief they doubt it you know I often said and we always say saving that looking at this this message here says that you know how could they see it and not believe how can they see all the things they saw and then the end of the story like was saying the other other day how can they see and and all these things and then at the end of the story it'd be that they didn't go in because of unbelief how can they see it all the Miracles the signs and the Wonders and they perish because they they didn't believe how how could that be possible but you know I say even when they got to the land and they come back it's just like God said it was come on God just as he described it the land is just like he said it was but yet we can't go over I can see Joshua and Caleb you know trying to encourage them brothers like I was saying the other day don't go back into that camp and sow that Discord of unbelief you know the devil do that get amongst the people and saw a Discord of unbelief when the ministry or the whatever the word can come and have the people on such a high faith of anointing right and the where things are beginning to break Deliverance is getting ready to come but here come the the enticing Spirit a lion Spirit unbelief come to say yeah but you know and to get the people to doubt it and then you miss your blessing come on but I could see Joshua and Caleb say to them brothers just dramatizing it don't show that in the monster people don't go back and tell the people those things we saw them yes but just tell the people that the land is just like God is God said it would be don't sow that amongst the people and look what they did look what that that seed of of of Doubt look what it did it calls them the Bible said they weeped all night you brought us out here to die we should have left stayed in Egypt but then Joshua and Caleb said no come on see they had to steal the people God has done too much for us already God has brought us too far don't you know we were in bondage don't you know where God brought us from let's have testimony service for a while before you begin to doubt let's testify what God brought us from let's let me tell you wait God where we were and look what all let's let's have testimony service before you go back down and before you disbelieve God think about what God has already done Hallelujah don't look at what the opposition in front of you look at what God has already done you know I believe it was David and everybody was afraid he said you can't fight them he a man of war since it's you David says well I fought that lion and God delivered me and I was a little I was a little younger then maybe a little less weight then and I and and the bear came and God delivered them in my hands I should have died back then when the lion came I should have died when the bear came oh I should have ran and let them have the Sheep but something inside of me said that you know like my father gave me charge over these sheep I might have 99 more but I ain't gonna let him get that one I'm going after them Hallelujah if I die trying to save that sheep let me die but nevertheless God gave him a promise that thy seed shall possess the gates of your enemies he went after that lying in that bear didn't even got that sheep back Hallelujah oh Jesus and this uncircumcised Philistine come on before I doubt let me testify before that entice the Spirit come to make me doubt let me think about what God has brought me from and I shouldn't have been here now but God did it way back then and if he did it then I'm stirred I know he can do it now come on Hallelujah that make you say hallelujah don't it glory to God look at what God has brought us from we right here at the land right here at that breakthrough right here at the place where God is going to take us in I ain't doubting now opposition is up against you we have to fight of our lives but the same God that brought us out is going to take us in Hallelujah Russia same God that delivered you from drugs and alcohol come on the things of the flesh the same God that delivered you stripped all those things off your life gave you the desire to serve them you said Lord I don't know how I'm going to obtain it but that God came down one day came and he'd tell you little by little I'ma Prosper you don't you worry about it you stand my word stay on your knees stay faithful Hallelujah hold fast to the end little by little I'ma Prosper you and little by little God has been doing it Hallelujah now we're at this opposition God is able he's more than able oh Jesus come on before you doubt think about what God has already brought you from think about your situation the opposition but before you doubt think about where God has already done for you come on don't let that entice the spirit get you come on that doubt get you I come too far the turnaround now I come too farther but doubt now come on I come too far now to give up and just let the enemy have a victory come on he's already one one to battle like this ain't that song Jesus dropped the charges he's my lawyer he's my judge and he's sitting on a jury how in the world can I lose his case I'm going to trial Hallelujah and he gonna stand for me oh I feel good tonight y'all feel all right God is so good come on I said it's before before uh you let that seed of Doubt get in there now go back start testifying or what God what what God has already done come on and watch Watch What Happens come on I believe it Watch What Happens I says but you got to hold fast don't do no good to come out cross all those great victories and all and get to the land get to the last opposition and can't go over you didn't hold faster than he says you got to hold fast not only to hold fast but you got to have confidence your confidence got to be there you know when a man loses confidence say you lose confidence in the person you can't hear nothing that person got to say you lose confidence in the preacher you can't hear nothing to preacher's saying right could be a word from God but you lost your confidence in him come on but it ain't your confidence in him but it's in the god in him the word of God that's what it is you see the word you see God and that's where your confidence lies in but like I said don't they got to hold fast your confidence in him knowing god you started me on this journey you picked me up you brought me where I am now and I know you're gonna carry me on the rest of the way you started it and I know you're like we said the other day he's able to finish the one that started to work he's able to finish it it's already a finished work he already when he stretch out those hands on Calvary and he said it's finished Hallelujah I see the Earth shaking the ground rumbling because God did something he broke the devil back didn't he their death lost his sting in that place when he hung out there it's over with now all the suffering all the pain all the things that he said that's over with and I hung those hands out said Lord it's finished father forgive them they'll know what they do it's finished the Earth shook why because the devil had a little bit of authority but God comes out to claim it all take it back from the Devil and John says you know what he saw them with the book of redemption he said I'll be getting a weep but no man was worth it but he heard a voice say weep not come on for the lion of the tribe of Judah he is prevailed to take the book Hallelujah and he looked and saw lamb as he been slain come on when those hands were stretched out he's coming to claim it hallelujah it's finished devil you had the people bound you had them stuff over the head you had them
