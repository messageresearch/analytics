me to the book of Exodus the first chapter and a lot of readings I'm going to try to cut it short by God's grace XS one eight through 14 then return to the book of Galatians five now there rolls up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold are people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we come let us deal wisely with them least they be multiplied and it come to pass that when their forth out any war they join also until our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh australia cities Pitman and ramasees but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and Egyptian made the children either to serve with rigor and he made their lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar and in brick in all men of service in the field all their service wherein they made and serve was with regal lo reactional bless the reading of your word sanctified in Jesus name Amen may be seated a maternity book of Galatians also the fifth chapter Galatians five time to cut a short but he's five and one stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ had made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage tonight I want to speak to you a little thought spiritual bondage spiritual bonds return back to the book of Exodus as I was thinking about bondage and bondage comes in many different forms voluntary and involuntary and we all in some way or another have been in some type of bondage or another I believe the most of all because of the Bible said man born of a woman of a few days and full of trouble we realize that our natural birth brought us into a natural bondage even when I'm thinking about bondage I'm thinking more spiritually but the natural does type the spiritual when we as people are conformed with different habits and different things that in our own very lives things that we know that it's not right but it's seemingly we don't know how to get out of the particular situation but I want you to understand that it is more of a spiritual thing than a natural thing one of the reasons sin had capture of eight the human lives where the first man in the first woman got made they were free they had everything in harmony they could go in and come out even with the animals there were nose killing there was no frustration there was no death or no sickness or anything everything was perfect but because that would happen in a garden it threw everything into bondage the human life the animal life everything B came to be subject to sickness and death disasters failures heart broke heart attacks everything begin to transpire these things fell on us God never meant for his people to be in bondage we often time you know you know talk about slavery but more spiritual and slavery we realize even now today that we have laws that govern certain things but in yet in all the laws that we have except there be in word our experience that calls you to leave beyond your sinful nature lives you remain in bondage and this is you know the system bearing Old Testament with Israel this was a system that had arise in in Egypt which is a type of the world in Israel who were the people of God at that time they found themselves in a place that they were like workhorses and the people of Egypt I'll begin to put more he said heavy burdens I believe there's still a system like that in another form yet it's the same spirit working in another way dance is cunning is it's very subtle but the purpose of it is they keep you in are in bondage we were made God purpose and he he created us for us to worship Him I realize even even in church you can be in bondage some time is the church that put people in bondage people become work hawlings if they they are working for the church or they're working for the preacher or whatever but no no no remember no man owns you God created us in His image so if we were created in that image of God we've got to get back to the image that image of of a son in a daughter of God that you are are free to to live a life that's pleasing under God talking about you know know the laws of the land we need them but no matter how much the laws might change the chain has to happen in us it has to be something that you understand that you are made in God's image and if we were made in that image we have to find a way to get back to where we fall from fail from scuse me we the whole earth was struck with a spiritual amnesia we lost our did it we lost whatever purpose was but in this hour God has made known to us who we really are that's one of the reason why the people are doing what they're doing because they understand understanding who they really are we are supposed to be free we are supposed to be equal in let God equal now but as Israel with Indians our Egyptian system and they had a king who who wanted to rule over them and and he wanted to bring Israel but it must be was something about them that he he won't be afraid of and I believe that even now does the devil know that our he's afraid of you realize who you really are and what your purpose is for being here and lo is he keep us with the fussing and fighting and you're the big one about this you missing the real picture this world he is not I'm a home we came from another world a world beyond what we see here but a spiritual Kingdom but I like it angulations v shop they said how Christ came let's go to that Galatian we i'ma go also back to X's blood school there's a Galatians the fifth chapter you know is sad that we even see spiritually speaking that people as Christians seems to have so much difficulties are getting free from ungodly habits in ungodly ways they go to church and the reason why they go which is a good thing because they believe that there's help that they can get from the church but it's not so much on the church but it got to be gone who you come to look for you've got to understand no man can can give you that kind of freedom it comes from God and God alone but I believe that as as the people go there they have some kind of confidence that what they're going to hear are they they're gonna benefit from it it will help them to get away from the state that they're presently in and come to a reality that they don't have to be in bondage anymore you know real freedom of the price that was paid one of the reasons that Jesus came and to be tempted on earth like as we are is to break all of the are the the bondage in the things that been holding a human race see God and the spirit couldn't go through that but he took all our body called Jesus and got in it to be tempted to be tried to be persecuted to be talked about and ridiculed to be laughed at and spit on to be called a devil yet he became our way out I thought about scapegoat he became our scapegoat he came to take upon him what we were in bondage to and I'm afraid that that that's world is missing the real reality of what he really came to do the policy Lula Sun has set free they are free indeed dumb he did this yet even he went even to the reading of the lost and he script the devil of every power that he had he came to break every deimata yoke that was holding the people hell was his strongest grip and when he script the devil others of his powers he rose again and he cared all power is given unto me he became the mighty conqueror he conquered everything for you and I he conquered sickness he conquered depression he conquered death he conquered every bondage that was a partner he would race he conquered it oh my element I understand a little bit about freedom when you have your evil natural freedom taken away from you they don't make you feel like a human being but it makes you feel like a real slave we don't really cherish you know what we're freedom really is until you lose it and I believe too many times spiritually speaking we have been living below our god-given privileges but God came to restore for us and the only way that he can do it now it has to be according to the way God and PIN for it to happen man can are organized a system and make declaration and make this and that but real freedom come from God it's like having a peace of mind and you know how it is sometime there in your mind you've seen that can't find peace in this life you can't find real freedom comes no matter what you even may achieve naturally it doesn't set you free like you really need to be having a lot of money don't set your free I know in the natural since yesterday but at the end of the day when you have to lay down there and you have to think on your very life you have to wonder what's gonna happen to me if I don't wake up you're very conscious brings you into bondage because they evil that you do in a corrupted things that you do i guilt come upon you you begin to look back in wonder ever anybody gonna ever catch any what you're doing but a balancing whosoever cover their sin shall not prosper everything that's been done in the dark it will come to light let's go back to the Exodus six I'm understanding clearly more and more this system that has been set up and it's still working even down today it's still having the same effect upon the people eyes because truly there are people that really wants to be free they want to be free from their habits they won't to have a peaceful life but they're looking forward in all the wrong places tonight if you're listening I pray that you understand if you ever meet the person of Jesus Christ and invite him into your life and truly repent see God don't hold you callable for your sins he know by nature you've been born into that but the problem is that he made a way of escape that way you don't have to live like that God don't want you to live in shackles and and any bondage you know I I was double now you know it that you can sometimes feel the bondage that people are in and then sometime you hear that cried a because I don't want to be like this I can't help it there was a man in the Bible who who used to cut himself and bail and he was so bad even change couldn't even hold him that's why I will mentor institution I like they are fooling people or mines have left and they seem they don't know what to do and they begin to be schizophrenic and diff things of that nature you know but God wants to bring you to your right mind I'll be out hurtful in seven say one time and I look at the definition but the word bonded it means servitude of subjection to a controlling force or person but he was saying that the devil want to control your mind not only he wants your mind but he want to control your whole body and accept God do something supernaturally in you you will follow him sometimes not even knowing it all cuz sometimes you know how we are we always think we are better than act but I want you to understand that as long as you are in sin and having give your life to God you in a form of slavery because there's a force that's that's telling you what to do you say well no I'll make up my own mind where do you get your mind from see there's something controlling you there's something that telling you you know things that maybe you know we do good things then we do bad things right and we think a lot of times the good things are out wherever bad things but see that's just like it wasn't in the garden God told them specifically do not touch the tree another good and evil or debt the day you die and God put you and I on a free more agent now you can choose it's your choice but remember this this choice you make now to determine away your spin eternity you know but I think God for His grace and mercy because sometimes especially as being in sin we make bad choices we do some time thinking that whether just the way to do it why because it's the system we want to be like everybody else but God did immediate you to be like everybody else God made you to be like him see we've got to wake up out of sleep and come back to reality Who am I what is my purpose what did I came here for just the doing this natural working and eating and sleeping and growing then die it got to be more to life in that it is the Bible saying he came to give us life and give us more abundantly extra six excuse me let's drop that excuse I'm sorry X is the second chapter I got to get this in XS - and 23 connecting from Genesis 1 and they said and it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died inaccurate of Israel side by reason of bondage and they cried and they crowd came up unto God by reason of bondage they got so heavy burden one king after the next rise up and he began to put war on a more bondage see the devil never stops you go from one thing to the next hoping that it'll get better after a while but if you understand here what the of Ezra did they begin to cry out to who to the preacher to the church no they cried out to God I believe that is a very good example if you want to be free cry out to God tell God I'm tired because they got tired of it and until you get tired of your condition and your situation and you begin to acknowledge that if anybody can do it I know God can do it somebody saying there anything too hard for the Lord no nothing is too hard for God to do but when you cry out I believe you like that one time said he said it won't rain too hot call for it see God is is waiting and warning us to begin to cry out when we are in bondage Lord set me free break these yolks these heavy burdens that is getting worse and worse and it gets so heavy the way you don't even think you want to live anymore but when you cry out Lord I realized that I made a mistake Lord and I'm sorry but Lord I heard that you can deliver in this church God can do it I believe somebody tonight and you crying out if you were looking for God to do it come on he's here to do it yes not tomorrow right now sometimes we put it off to this input of that know when you want to be free tonight I want to be free now no matter what it is god I know you a table there's never been nothing too hard for you to do you know sometime you're listening to people that talk to you and you hear cry and I know all of us get to a point I know I did that sometimes we go have things that you know allies and and we never getting to say Lord I'm tired of this decision with this condition may be something that aren't that you need God you know to break yokes you need deliverance from the things of the world maybe from your flesh our own flesh puts us in bondage the very thing we take care of everything we grew the very thing we cherish it's your worst enemy you got your own body this thing here see you know it's not what God intended that's why it's out of control that's why the world is out of control whatever seemed right to them they do it why because they're in bondage the masters they kill they kill whatever their master tell them it's a force it's a spirit that's controlling even the whole world it's a system that Satan is ruling how many of you remember the story when Jesus on his fast and Satan took Jesus to the highest temple and begin to tell him he showed him all the kingdoms of the world he began listening the China bribe Jesus say now if you bow down and worship me I'll give you all these wait a minute how can you give something unless you control it and he's shorting all the king of the whole world you know he was saying that this whole world system is under my influence the influence is a powerful thing see the Bible say that he's the prince in parity the powers of the air Satan controls it in this system that the world system that we're in it is really under the influence of Satan in the RET the people don't even understand what they're dealing with they think it's just man and if they could just know it's a higher force than that it's a controlling force he wants to control you what for remember he wanted to be like God so in order be like God then he has to have a gospel he has to have a church he had to have people that you know gonna worship but yet don't know they can actually be worshiping the sainted and not God that was the purpose to be like the Most High remember about us that he calls a third of God angels I wonder what was his sermon he preached in heaven he preached 2/3 of God angel and caused them to believe his right now notice now if he did that in heaven what do you think he's doing on earth we think we are mad should we think we're smarter and because we got scientifically and we haven't got more advancing oh we know a lot of things but you don't know what you're dealing with you have somebody to get over 2,000 years of experience one day I've been in heaven with God now let's go next to this six God never meant for us to be in bondage under nothing even though we do things in our people's lives but God came to set you free yes you can be free from drugs from pornography doesn't matter from sickness yes you can help freedom real freedom but it only comes through accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and give him your whole life coz I want to tell you this if you don't give it to God a devil gonna take it bondage a controlling force X is six and I'm closing five and six remember we've read earlier in Nexus two and 23 how to shoot reveals are beginning to cry out to God because their bonnets had gotten worse I like to tell you something until you understand that you need God more than you need anything he's the only one who can give you real freedom X is 6 5 & 6 you sit down and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptian keep in bondage and I have remembered my covenant where force into the treat of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out I like that from under the burdens of the Egyptian and I will read you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a scratch our arm and with great judgments and I would take you to me for people and I would be to you a God he should know that I am the Lord your God was bringing you out from under the burden of the Egyptian sea because they trusted and cried out to God God remembered his covenant and I want you to know that God have not forgotten about his covenant with you the purpose he gave His only begotten Son is to rid us to rid the sin problem not to all cover it but to take it away in other words to take it from you through the very life that he lived he gave his life for you that you can have his life in other words he took your place that way you don't have to be in bondage anymore why good I did it Jesus did it for me he did it for you you can't be free doesn't matter what the circumstances our condition is you can have real freedom god bless you tonight amen did it for you amen we thank
