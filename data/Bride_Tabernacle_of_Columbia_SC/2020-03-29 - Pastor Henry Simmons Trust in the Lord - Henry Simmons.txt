ask you to touch her today Lord God all the sick and troubled and afflicted Lord at you to touch Lord healing the liver set free by the power of the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ for we thank you Lord in Jesus name Amen the book of Proverbs the third chapter the first verse she says my son forget not my law let thy heart keep my Commandments for strength of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not nursey and truth for safety bind them about my neck and write them upon the table of that heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not tonight on understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path be not wise in our own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil it shall be held to thy navel and marrow to their bone honor the Lord with our substance and with the first-fruit of all that increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and our pressure burst out with new wine trust in the Lord with all thine heart god bless to renew his words you may be seated praise God amen trust in the Lord with all thine heart in times like these we can trust in many things but the subject this morning is trust in the law so many times we heard many see that on the American dollar money it says trust in God in god we trust in god we trust' but is that a reality is that just something we put on our money that we trust in god we trust' i want to know this morning is that reality is that just so common saying In God We Trust let's think about it do we really trust him here it says trust in the law with all not just trust him with some we're trusting the Lord with all thine heart another thing he said he said in lean not to thy I believe the problem with In God We Trust and trusting in the Lord I believe many lean to their own understanding and he axes us not to lean to our own understanding just a little bit before we you know really got into the message this morning want to reflect on some things as we were praying we've had flesh and red lights of the coming of the Lord and because there's so many times God has put stop signs and gives us opportunity to they meant to turn back to him and turn from wickedness and evil and turn back to God so many signs of we've had storms and earthquakes we had all kind of things that happen that God says Amen there are I'm coming amen we recognize as the prophet of God talked about the signs of the time aim and he talked about a wicked and adulterous generation amen and how they can discern the face of the sky and they know whether his fire wealth or farewell though but he meant the signs of the time they don't seem to understand and I believe that there was a question axe in my fuse 24 Amen they asked Jesus amen when shall the end come amen is just the end of time and we've also many times folks have prophesied and predicted that the end of time was that a near amen round in 1900 so we had those that they meant went forth and said at the turn of the 19-hundred sin said the end of the world was prevalent we said in year 2000 it's at the end of the world will see so many a time we have come and will face the end well one look like it all was gonna oval be over with then world war two we will face what the world coming to it is in and it's been so many times that I write war amen went on it was going on it looks like all nations came together and looked like we were coming to the time of the end then so we had flashing red lights of the end time and the end coming he meant we've had all kind of things when the bombs was dropped on in Japan in the block it was all over the world had come to his end amen and we realized that the world that we know now is falling apart and I thought about the a mental or I'm all the king's horses and all the king's men could not put Humpty Dumpty together again and I'll say it all the king's horses and all the king's men they meant won't be able to put this world that's fallen apart together again so brothers and sisters we ought not to trust in our own ability for he said lean not that I own understanding and I want you to know if he meant without then are you ready for what's next amen are you ready for the end amen they've put all this over with and it's all come to his end now are you ready and if you not ready then I trust he meant that you would get ready because we're at a junction a junction of time as God's servants say we're at a junction amen and that disjunction amen sometimes we come to crossroads and at that cross world we must make a decision so we had a junction amen that decisions has to be made we were at a place in a min American history that they met the Congress and the President and everybody had to come together see can we stop the crisis that we're here what can we do to the financial a mint situation than the stock market and all that is going on can we hold it together can we just hold on a little while longer they meant but I'm saying to you amen praise God thank God for all those that are instrumental in doing Amen all that they can do amen but it's gonna take more than what they're doing amen to hold things together it's gonna take God and I'm saying trust in the Lord so by the grace of God we want to pray for them and we want to pray to God in Wrath we'll remember Marcia realize and then amen at this particular crisis time he meant we need to trust God they meant we needed amen we need to turn our hearts and our tension in our mind to the war is able to deliver that is able to help us trust in the Lord but I believe sometimes when trouble call me men men return a meteo all types of solutions he meant I remember when a men saw was in the king he meant and he couldn't find any healthy men look like God was not hearing him because his spiritual backslidden condition and he turned to the wits of India amen which called up Samuel the Prophet and Sam you're told so you're gonna be with me tomorrow at this time he meant I want you to know amen people are turned when they get desperate Amen praise God my son said it when he was about three or four amen my sister had fixed him something to eat Calloway thought good he said to her about three or four years old he said a hungry man to eat anything normally do when out of desperation will focus what a man will do when he get enough but I'm talking about our desperation with God I know God can help America God can help the world if the world would tend to God amen I believe that Jesus they make cares about us no matter what the conditions are no matter how the troubles in the builders role I believe God still cares in trusting in the Lord with all that heart I believe many have come to the point but it's not something new because in that we might be going through things right now but the Bible says the Solomon says there's nothing new Under the Sun I believe perilous times have come before they met and I believe that folks have experienced they met these days before in different times and different times in history to point back to the eighteen hundreds and talks about the plague that hit then and then they talk about different things that have happened but I'll tell you they went through him at the time of yellow fever and they went through the time things that have happened to history men when I was a little boy amen we talked about polio and they talked about this and they talked about that it was different crisis has come but this time it seemed to hit the whole world at once brother and sister and I'll tell you something amen this world amen it's a shock in the whole world so the world is in shock they meant and it's taking a whole day cuz he meant the world it's galvanized itself together and dependent on one another amen but I'll tell you God says Amen we may depend on one another but I tell you time now that we depend on God in the praise God we can call him we can reach to the four corners of the earth but we oughta be able to reach to heaven amen because we need heaven to help us now because the four corners of the earth even though we reach to channel and oh we reach them Lapine's until we reach a mentor South Africa do we reach amen praise God to the full utmost parts of the earth I want to tell you we need to return to God it's a God I trust you hallelujah it's time to trust in God amen praise God here we are and I'm saying that was an individual in the Bible he meant now why should I tell you Amen I believe that the Word of God wants to build our faith and I'll confident that we have a God that's concerned about us and that he cares in spite of what we are going through in spite infirmities and in spite of our fliction God still cares amen there was a man by the name of Jove he had troubles he met Joe in his troubles amen praise God he came to a port that he lost his children he lost everything labaki had his cattle even his wealth and he lost everything praise God was only under tests I believe what we go through Amen God is saying what you go to I'm just making your strong drawing your closer I just want you to know it's taking you to the next level I'm getting you in rats in condition I want you to face the big build-up I want you to trust me the ball hallelujah I want you to trust me so joven he said knocking I came in in his world and naked shall I return the Lord gave the Lord taketh away he said blessed be the name of the law bless the Lord that's why the song is said I'm a blessed Lord at what all times a ministry should continue to be in my mouth hey do you want a blessing this morning hey men do you want to tell them Lord I still love you lord i still believe yeah go to Kashi In God We Trust it's a reality to me praise God he's been too good to us and too good for everything that you can think about god is good if you don't do anything else he's already not enough amen he's already done enough praise God God already done enough for me in my life he meant for me to say Lord I think that God is still good doesn't matter Amen I believe job had that testimony he said goal you slay me hey man he say yeah I will crush you he knew he was going through things in his body and I believe that his friends had well for circling him and they were coming against you but he said lord I trust I'm gonna trust his wife says image over look at yo God look like God don't hear your prayer look like God don't care about you but I want you to know he met Joel Santas you talk like one of the foolish women now he though he slay me I want you to know God matter what we go through you gotta keep trusting the law hallelujah well I think the Lord that Joel was determined to trust the law I know David went through some trouble times in his life and he declared why he was going through his trouble amen he realized that he had a confidence in God and he said God is our refuge he realized that he had a refuge he had a place of safety he said God is our refuge not only is he our refuge but he is our strength amen I know that God is our refuge that we ever needed a refuge a hiding place a safe place Amen God is God is our refuge and things might be going well today in your life that need a refuge there are many they need a friend that a stick closer than a brother they met there's somebody that needs somebody to talk to somebody that can do something about my situation and my condition hallelujah praise God folks are locked themselves in and they won't even open the door and
