[40:18] Yes, I will. [music]
[40:26] [music]
[40:32] [music]
[40:39] [music]
[40:42] Amen.

[40:46] [applause]
[40:47] Amen. Amen. I'm going to get my vocals
[40:50] together one day.
[40:52] I know Charlotte told me not to try it
[40:54] right now, but God is good anyhow. Ain't
[40:57] he?
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads in a word of
[41:00] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come
[41:03] to you this morning, Lord, as humble as
[41:05] we know how, Lord. Oh God, to give your
[41:08] name praise, Lord, and thanks for all
[41:11] your goodness and your grace. Lord, I
[41:13] thank you, Lord, for blessing us to be
[41:15] here today, Lord. And, oh God, to be
[41:18] able to sing praises and to worship your
[41:20] name, Lord. God, I pray Lord that if we
[41:24] said or done anything that ain't like
[41:25] you and if it would hinder the move of
[41:27] God this morning, Lord, I pray that you
[41:29] would forgive us and Lord that you would
[41:31] help us Lord to be reconciled to you and
[41:34] oh God to get out of the way Lord that
[41:37] you might have your way this morning
[41:39] [music] God I pray that you'd bless the
[41:41] ministers of the gospel Lord as they go
[41:43] forth Lord all over the land oh God
[41:45] surely Lord Lord we need a word from you
[41:48] God we need something that will sustain
[41:50] us in the hour that we live in seeing
[41:52] that these are treacherous times and but
[41:54] oh God I believe that your grace is
[41:56] sufficient for us and I pray that you
[41:59] continue to move, continue to bless God,
[42:02] save, heal and deliver by the power of
[42:04] the Holy Ghost. Bless Lord those that
[42:07] need to bless Lord and touch Lord that
[42:10] need to be touched Lord. Thank you Lord
[42:12] for we love you and we appreciate you.
[42:14] In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Let
[42:17] the church say amen. Amen. [music] Amen.
[42:20] We want to look at the book of Hebrews
[42:22] by the grace of God. Hebrews 11.
[42:27] Feel all right this morning?
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 and we'll begin at the first
[42:36] verse. Very familiar scripture.
[42:40] We want to talk about faith and action
[42:42] this morning. Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Faith in action.
[42:47] Hebrews 11.
[42:49] We'll begin here at the first verse. If
[42:52] you got it, say amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And it reads, "Now faith is the
[42:56] substance of things hoped for, the
[42:59] evidence of things not seen. For by it
[43:02] the elders obtained a good report.
[43:05] Through faith we understand that the
[43:08] worlds were framed by the word of God,
[43:10] so that the things which are seen were
[43:14] not made of the things which do appear."
[43:16] By faith, Abel offered unto God a more
[43:20] excellent sacrifice
[43:22] than Cain, by which he obtained witness
[43:26] that he was righteous. God testifying of
[43:30] his gifts. By it he being dead yet
[43:35] speaketh. By faith, Enoch was translated
[43:38] that he should not see death and was not
[43:40] found because God had translated him
[43:44] before he was trans for his translation.
[43:46] He had a testimony that pleased God. But
[43:50] without faith, it's impossible to please
[43:52] him. For he that cometh to God must
[43:55] believe that he is and that he is a
[43:57] rewarder of him that diligently seek
[44:00] him. You may be seated. I'm going read
[44:02] down a little further. I like how it
[44:04] says that you know uh through for by you
[44:08] know faith it says here in the second
[44:10] verse the elders obtain their good
[44:11] report. Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; So faith doesn't give out bad reports.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith only going to give you a
[44:18] good report. Right?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Everything else your all other five
[44:22] senses might give you a bad report but
[44:24] faith is going to give you a good
[44:26] report.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; When everybody everything else is saying
[44:28] it's all bad, faith going to say it's
[44:30] all well. Right? Amen.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning?
[44:34] &gt;&gt; And you might look at it and say, "Well,
[44:36] how is it all well? Look at this." But
[44:37] faith saying all is well. Calm down.
[44:39] Hallelujah.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; God's got it all under control. Do you
[44:43] believe that this morning?
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's and that's where we
[44:46] at right now. It says, you know, uh even
[44:48] the other night I was laying on the
[44:50] couch and I'll say it again that you
[44:51] know I was saying and something says to
[44:53] me, you know, look at all these
[44:54] mountains in the way, right? But at the
[44:56] same time, something believe said to me
[44:59] and I believe those faith said the this
[45:01] ain't a mountain. this a test.
[45:02] Hallelujah. And I says, I'm going to
[45:04] pass this test. I said, so many tests
[45:07] was put before people. I says, what it
[45:09] is, we got to understand that what the
[45:11] devil does a lot of times, he plays mind
[45:13] games with people, don't he?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Because remember when Jesus rules, he
[45:18] said, "All power is given unto me."
[45:20] Right?
[45:20] &gt;&gt; So if he has all power, then how much
[45:22] does the devil have?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; The devil don't have none, does he? So
[45:26] when he's talking about what control
[45:28] he's got over you, he's only got the
[45:30] control that you give over him. Right?
[45:32] But I said, I ain't giving the devil no
[45:34] control. I'm taking it back. Hallelujah.
[45:36] I ain't letting them have control over
[45:37] my home. I'm taking my home back. I'm
[45:40] taking my children back. I'm taking my
[45:41] job back, my finance, whatever it is.
[45:43] Come on. God has given us the victory.
[45:45] How many believe that?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. And one thing about God, it
[45:49] don't God time ain't nothing to God, is
[45:52] it?
[45:53] &gt;&gt; When God promise you something, it don't
[45:54] matter how long it is. God's word is
[45:57] still true. Right? When it left his
[45:59] mouth, it ain't going to return to him
[46:01] without accomplishing that which he sent
[46:02] it to do. Hallelujah. So, I believe what
[46:05] God says. Hallelujah. No matter how long
[46:08] it takes, I say, "God, I believe what
[46:09] you said." Hallelujah. And I got faith
[46:12] to wait on it.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many feel like waiting this
[46:15] morning?
[46:16] &gt;&gt; God is good, ain't he?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Faith in action. Come on. Says, "By
[46:20] faith, Enoch was translated." And it
[46:23] says that he should not see death and
[46:24] was not found because God translated him
[46:28] before his translation. It says he had a
[46:31] testimony. Come on. How many got a
[46:33] testimony this morning?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. But his testimony did what? His
[46:37] testimony pleased God, didn't it?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. We talking about faith and
[46:40] action. Some people say, "I got faith,
[46:42] but they walk around and can't hardly
[46:44] get around." Right?
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. But faith in action.
[46:47] Hallelujah.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Pain bothering you getting around
[46:50] anyway, ain't you? Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. Somebody say, "You look like
[46:53] you barely making." And you say, "No,
[46:55] but every step I take, I'm moving by the
[46:57] power of God." Hallelujah. Come on.
[46:59] Every mo every foot my foot uh steps
[47:02] mean possessions, right? So, I might
[47:04] have been fighting, but since I made
[47:06] that step, I'm possessing that ground.
[47:08] Hallelujah. And when I possess that
[47:09] ground, I ain't giving nothing back to
[47:11] the devil. Hallelujah. God didn't give
[47:13] you victory for you to give it back to
[47:14] the devil, did he? Come on. But he said
[47:16] it's yours. Hallelujah. And if it's
[47:18] mine, GOD SAID IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. I
[47:21] don't care what the devil say.
[47:22] Hallelujah. How many believe that this
[47:24] morning? Come on. That's where I I feel
[47:26] like. Come on. I feel like taking
[47:29] mountains. Hallelujah.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; I feel like Caleb. He said I was I was
[47:33] so many years ago when God promised me
[47:35] this mountain, right? Because I stood
[47:37] before him and I was faithful. And it
[47:39] don't matter how many years ago that
[47:41] been, right?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. I think he said I was 40 that
[47:44] was 45 years ago or so. He says, you
[47:46] know, come on. And I can tell his
[47:47] testimony for him this morning.
[47:49] Hallelujah. He said, "Because I've been
[47:51] through a lot back then, right? We've
[47:53] been through A LOT OF BATTLES AND STORMS
[47:54] since then, right?" Hallelujah. I got
[47:57] more scars than I had back then, right?
[47:59] MIGHT BE A LITTLE OLDER than I was back
[48:01] then, but nevertheless, THE PROMISE OF
[48:03] GOD STANDS ASSURE. HALLELUJAH. GOD
[48:06] PROMISED IT TO ME AND I STILL WANT IT.
[48:08] HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. GIVE ME MY
[48:11] MOUNTAIN. GIVE ME MY BLESSINGS. GIVE ME
[48:14] WHAT GOD [screaming] PROMISED ME. COME
[48:16] ON. HALLELUJAH. Y'all feel all right
[48:18] this morning? Come on. Before he left
[48:21] here, Enoch had a testimony that did
[48:23] what? Please God, right? Come on. How
[48:26] many want to be pleasing in God's sight?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. God ain't going to just take
[48:29] you on without a testimony that's
[48:31] pleasing to him. Right. Come on. West
[48:33] going to be pleasing to God when you
[48:35] willing to do his will. Right. Come on.
[48:37] When you LEARN TO SAY, "GOD, NOT MY
[48:39] WILL, but thy will." Hallelujah. When
[48:41] you learn that everything that you look
[48:43] at it, come on, it's only temporary.
[48:45] Here today and gone tomorrow.
[48:46] Hallelujah. When you learn to seek after
[48:49] the things that'll last. Hallelujah. And
[48:51] what'll last? The things that you do for
[48:53] God will last. Hallelujah. Come on. MAN
[48:55] WILL FORGET WHAT YOU DO ABOUT HIM. BUT
[48:57] GOD WON'T FORGET. HALLELUJAH. HE WON'T
[48:59] FORGET YOUR LABOR. HE WON'T FORGET THE
[49:01] NIGHTS YOU CRIED. HE WON'T FORGET THE
[49:03] NIGHTS YOU STAYED IN PRAYER AND STOOD IN
[49:05] THE GAP. GOD WON'T FORGET [screaming]
[49:07] THAT NOW.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart.
[49:11] Hallelujah. He had a testimony that
[49:13] pleased God. Come on.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] But he says without faith, right? Come
[49:18] on, somebody say without faith.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Without faith.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU NEED FAITH, DON'T YOU?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; You need faith this morning.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; You got to believe at some point, right?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
[49:34] THINKING ABOUT? I say it's one thing, a
[49:36] sense of faith won't fail you.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Won't fail you. Right? Faith to bring
[49:42] the impossible and make it possible.
[49:44] Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; You know, it says that the world by
[49:48] faith, we believe that uh the world was
[49:51] created by the word of God, right?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; I like saying that all the time. I say
[49:56] that everything we see is a product of
[49:58] the spoken word of God.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. We believe that everything we
[50:03] see, come on, is at one point it was
[50:05] spoken, right?
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And that's how it appeared. DON'T YOU
[50:08] KNOW THAT? THAT'S HOW MUCH THAT'S HOW
[50:10] POWERFUL THE word of God is. THAT WHEN
[50:13] GOD SPEAKS, IT DON'T SAY, "HE, I spoke
[50:15] and it didn't happen." NO. WHEN GOD
[50:17] SPEAKS, it happens, don't it?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. WHEN HE SPEAKS SOMETHING, IT'S
[50:21] GOT TO BE JUST WHAT HE SAID. RIGHT.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON. EVERYTHING WE SEE IS A PRODUCT
[50:25] OF THE SPOKEN WORD. HALLELUJAH. He said,
[50:28] "LET THERE BE AND THERE WAS." RIGHT?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; COME ON. I LIKE THAT. HALLELUJAH.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD IS TRYING
[50:35] TO GET US TO THAT FAITH. COME ON. HE
[50:38] SAYS THAT HE TELL DISCIPLES ONCE. HE
[50:40] SAYS, "WHY ARE YOU DOUBTING?" HE SAYS IF
[50:42] YOU WOULD ONLY BELIEVE, RIGHT? HE SAID
[50:44] IT'LL BE AS YOU SAY, RIGHT? COME ON. GOD
[50:47] PUT THAT SAME WORD IN YOUR MOUTH THAT
[50:49] WHEN YOU SPEAK, HALLELUJAH. THINGS WILL
[50:51] BEGIN TO CREATE. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU GOT
[50:54] TO ONLY WHAT? BELIEVE. HALLELUJAH.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. I like screaming. Oh Jesus.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. Something happens, don't it?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Something about, you know, I
[51:06] was thinking about speaking, right? I
[51:09] says, "We got to start speaking, don't
[51:10] we?"
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. The other night we was was I
[51:13] would say we was joking around, but I'm
[51:15] being serious. Brother Gordon, I said,
[51:17] "We speaking things into existence this
[51:18] year."
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; I said, "What you want?" He said, "I
[51:21] want to be home, brother."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, you going to be home?" I
[51:24] told Caleb, I said, "Since you going to
[51:25] start calling the date, what's the
[51:26] date?" He going to be home. [laughter]
[51:28] Come on. CALL IT OUT. HALLELUJAH. And we
[51:31] going TO SPEAK IT, RIGHT?
[51:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON. DO Y'ALL BELIEVE THAT? COME ON.
[51:35] DO Y'ALL BELIEVE WE WE SERVE A GOD THAT
[51:38] POWERFUL? COME ON. HALLELUJAH. THAT WHEN
[51:40] YOU SPEAK, MOUNTAINS ARE MOVED. COME ON.
[51:43] SITUATIONS ARE CHANGED.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; COME ON. I BELIEVE THAT.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[51:49] I like how sister was saying the other
[51:51] night, all her children are saved and
[51:53] sanctified. Hallelujah. She said she's
[51:55] speaking it right. YOU GOT TO START
[51:56] SPEAKING, RIGHT? NOT ONLY SPEAKING, BUT
[51:59] BELIEVING WHAT YOU SAY. HALLELUJAH. COME
[52:01] ON. AIN'T NO TIME LIMIT WITH GOD, RIGHT?
[52:04] COME ON. HE SAID IT BE AS YOU SAY.
[52:06] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that centurion.
[52:09] Hallelujah.
[52:11] Oh Jesus. I was stirred up. That
[52:13] centurion, he came, you know, he wasn't
[52:15] even had no right to come to Jesus,
[52:17] right? Come on. A gentile, right? People
[52:19] that had them in captive, but when he
[52:22] did when he had he he got in desperation
[52:24] one day, right? He had somebody in his
[52:27] house that he loved. Hallelujah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And that person was going through maybe
[52:31] at the point of death, but he loved
[52:32] them. Hallelujah. He loved him enough to
[52:35] go to the one that he ain't even look
[52:37] like he had no right to go to, right? Oh
[52:39] Jesus, how humble he had TO GET TO PRESS
[52:42] his way through, right? To go to the the
[52:44] ONE THAT WE GOT CAPTIVE BECAUSE WHAT HE
[52:47] SAW IN HIM, AUTHORITY in him, RIGHT? HE
[52:50] SAW IN JESUS THERE WAS POWER IN JESUS.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; COME ON. And that's the SAME THING
[52:55] TODAY. YOU GOT TO REALIZE [screaming]
[52:56] THERE'S POWER IN THE NAME OF JESUS. COME
[52:58] ON. YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT THE BLOOD
[53:01] NEVER LOST HIS POWER. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU
[53:03] GOT A NEED? PRESS YOUR WAY THROUGH.
[53:05] HALLELUJAH. SOMEBODY MIGHT TELL YOU,
[53:08] "OH, THIS AND THAT. GO DO THIS. GO DO
[53:10] THAT." COME [screaming] ON. NO. BUT I'M
[53:11] GOING TO JESUS. HALLELUJAH. I SAW WHAT
[53:14] HE DOES. I KNOW WHAT he can do.
[53:15] Hallelujah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. That centurion went to Jesus,
[53:22] didn't he?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; I like how he began to say, "Come on. We
[53:25] said faith in action." He's faith was in
[53:27] action, wasn't he?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. He went to him. I can see
[53:30] everybody say, "Look, the centurion
[53:31] coming. have nothing to do with him,
[53:33] right? But he began to say, "Hey,
[53:35] Jesus." Hallelujah. Come on. He says, "I
[53:38] got a servant. I got one in my house."
[53:40] Hallelujah. He's sick towards death. I
[53:42] know what we're doing, y'all people. I'm
[53:44] just paraphrasing, right? I know how we
[53:46] got y'all in Cal, but I got a need. And
[53:48] I know that you're the only one that can
[53:50] meet that need. Hallelujah. Money can't
[53:52] meet that need. Hallelujah. Nobody else
[53:54] can't meet that need but you.
[53:56] Hallelujah.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said, "Come
[53:58] on, I'll go to your house." Hallelujah.
[54:00] But it was something about his faith.
[54:02] Hallelujah. It was in action, wasn't it?
[54:05] He says that I SEE SOMETHING IN YOU THAT
[54:07] [screaming] I DON'T SEE IN NOBODY ELSE.
[54:08] HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T EVEN GOT TO COME
[54:10] TO MY HOUSE. HALLELUJAH. I [screaming]
[54:12] SEE THAT YOU GOT AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH.
[54:15] SPEAK THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'LL BE
[54:17] JUST AS YOU SAY, I BELIEVE IT.
[54:19] [screaming] HALLELUJAH. FAITH IN ACTION.
[54:22] HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. HALLELUJAH.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus begin to tell to his people this
[54:29] way. I'm trying to get y'all to.
[54:30] Hallelujah.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I ain't seen no greater faith
[54:33] than all of Israel." Right? He said,
[54:35] "This the way this FAITH THIS MAN GOT,
[54:37] THIS WAY I'M TRYING TO GET Y'ALL AT."
[54:39] HALLELUJAH. HE LOOKED DOWN AT ME. HE
[54:40] SAID, "AS YOU SAY IT BE it unto you."
[54:42] Hallelujah. COME ON. FAITH WAS IN
[54:44] ACTION. RIGHT.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SPOKE IT AND FAITH WAS
[54:48] THERE, RIGHT?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE GOT BACK TO HIS HOUSE, HE HAD
[54:51] GREETINGS THERE ALL HIS WAY. HALLELUJAH.
[54:54] WHAT IT WAS, [screaming] FAITH GAVE HIM
[54:55] A GOOD REPORT, DIDN'T IT? HALLELUJAH.
[54:58] SOMEBODY OUGHT TO GIVE GOD PRAISE THIS
[55:00] MORNING. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SAY THANK
[55:02] YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I said
[55:05] faith in action. Come on.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; By faith. Come on.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; FAITH MOVES MOUNTAINS, don't it?
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. SOMEBODY SAID, "I GOT FAITH,
[55:12] BUT FAITH WITHOUT WORKS is dead, ain't
[55:14] it?"
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I GOT FAITH, BUT I AIN'T doing
[55:16] nothing. Come on. Oh, you got to have
[55:18] faith. AND YOU GOT TO MOVE. HALLELUJAH.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. Move it. And that's what we was
[55:22] reading here. I know we want to get them
[55:24] all, but looking here at at through the
[55:27] scriptures, I said what it was. The
[55:29] these warriors are what we call heroes
[55:31] of faith, right?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Their faith was in action, wasn't it?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. They didn't just say, "Oh, I
[55:38] believe." And not do nothing about it,
[55:39] but they believed and they begin to
[55:40] move, didn't they?
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. One thing about Abraham, I was
[55:44] looking at him. I says, "You know who
[55:46] God called Abraham. All he heard was a
[55:48] voice, right?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And his voice told him to get out,
[55:51] right?"
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'mma make of you a great
[55:53] nation. Right?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; His his uh uh uh uh uh way of thinking
[55:58] right from the beginning, him already
[56:00] being old. Sometimes we look at and
[56:03] dried up. If he would have looked at his
[56:05] at his own uh uh body or whatever right
[56:08] from the beginning, then he might have
[56:10] said, "I ain't going to go." Right? But
[56:12] what did faith tell him? Hallelujah. He
[56:14] had a belief. He wanted something from
[56:16] God, didn't he? Come on. And did he
[56:18] receive it? Yes, he received it. But
[56:20] what did he have to do? HE HAD TO GET UP
[56:22] AND MOVE, DIDN'T HE?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. But even though he got up and
[56:25] moved, it was trial after trial, right?
[56:28] Situation after situation. Hallelujah.
[56:30] But still yet, faith had a move, didn't
[56:33] it?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. And when he moved, God did
[56:35] something, didn't he? GOD CAME ON the
[56:37] scene. And that's what it is today. Come
[56:39] on. God wants you to move. God is not a
[56:42] liar. Come on. He's not a man that he
[56:44] should lie, but he'll do everything his
[56:46] word said he'll do. Right?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. But you got to have faith to do
[56:50] what? Believe. And your faith, what it
[56:52] was, your faith to make you move, right?
[56:54] Your faith to make YOU GET UP AND DO
[56:56] SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HALLELUJAH. TAKE
[56:58] BACK WHAT THE DEVIL STOLE from you. COME
[57:00] ON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND SAD
[57:02] and weary and in doubt all the time
[57:04] worrying about this and WORRYING ABOUT
[57:06] THAT. COME ON. THE DEVIL PUT THOSE
[57:08] THINGS ON YOU, RIGHT? THROUGH THE FIVE
[57:10] SENSES, BUT THE SENSE OF FAITH ONLY HAS
[57:12] A GOOD REPORT. HALLELUJAH. BILLS ARE
[57:15] DUE. COME ON. CHILDREN GONE OUT. COME
[57:18] ON. BODY IS IN PAIN. BUT NEVERTHELESS,
[57:20] [screaming] I GOT A GOOD REPORT.
[57:22] HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAID HE'LL
[57:24] SUPPLY ALL OF MY NEEDS ACCORDING TO HIS
[57:26] RICHES AND GLORY. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAID,
[57:29] "I'M THE LORD THY [screaming] GOD THAT
[57:30] HEALTHTH THEE." COME ON.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:34] SOMEBODY OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD FOR THAT
[57:36] THIS MORNING. KNOWING [screaming] THAT
[57:37] GOD CAN DO ALL THINGS, CAN'T HE?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're talking about faith in
[57:42] action. Hallelujah. Come on. One thing,
[57:44] you know, I I was I was thinking about
[57:46] so many testimonies. Hallelujah. of what
[57:49] God done. I remember, you know, it
[57:51] wasn't long ago and my leg, my left leg
[57:54] was bothering me so bad. I I got the
[57:56] little knot still, some of the little
[57:58] knot is still there on my leg, but I
[58:01] couldn't even bend down hardly. And
[58:03] every time I bend down, it was in so
[58:04] much pain. This was a little while ago.
[58:07] And I I was going through and I went to
[58:09] the doctor and they look at my legs and
[58:12] first they were telling me at one point,
[58:13] you got fluid in your legs, right? Then
[58:15] they said it was arthritis [laughter]
[58:18] at 42 years old. Arthritis in your bone,
[58:22] the shins, right? Got got the problems
[58:24] with your knees and and I was getting to
[58:26] pray and I said, "Lord, thing hurt so
[58:28] bad sometimes I couldn't even bend
[58:30] down." But I remember one night,
[58:32] hallelujah, I came to service and uh
[58:34] brother Simmons in the back before I
[58:36] come out, I think must have had to
[58:37] preach that night. I said, "Brother
[58:39] Simmons," I said, "Could you lay hands
[58:40] on this leg for me?" Right? So he
[58:43] reached out and when he laid his hands
[58:44] on that leg. Hallelujah. He prayed for
[58:47] my leg back there in the back office.
[58:49] When I come out and I sat down on the
[58:51] front pew, all of a sudden I felt
[58:53] something tightening around my leg like
[58:55] somebody putting an ace band or
[58:57] something real tight around my leg. So
[58:59] I'm thinking what in the world going on,
[59:00] right? But don't you know from that
[59:03] service even until now that was I don't
[59:05] know how many months ago brother Sim
[59:07] could testify. I don't know how many
[59:08] months ago I ain't had not one pain in
[59:10] that leg since. Come on. And I've been
[59:12] walking and praising God. Now the little
[59:14] the little bumper n is still there. They
[59:16] could have called it off riders or
[59:18] whatever there was. It don't matter what
[59:20] it was, but I know one thing. Faith took
[59:22] it away. Hallelujah. What was it? Was
[59:24] faith in action. He said you you lay
[59:26] hands on the sick. Hallelujah. And you
[59:28] shall recover. He laid that hand on it.
[59:30] I AIN'T HAD A PAIN SINCE. HALLELUJAH.
[59:33] WHAT IT WAS FAITH. HALLELUJAH. IN
[59:35] ACTION.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; COME ON. GOD trying to show us
[59:38] something. Ain't he? I remember another
[59:40] time, this is years ago, I had some
[59:43] stomach pains. Come on. I'm just trying
[59:44] to increase your faith this morning.
[59:46] Come on. Faith in action. Sometimes we
[59:49] have issues, but we don't tell nobody
[59:50] about them. Right? We don't want to say,
[59:52] "I don't want it." But what it is,
[59:54] you'll tell the doctor and everybody
[59:55] else about it, but what about the saints
[59:57] in prayer? Hallelujah. What about doing
[59:59] what the word of God says? But sometimes
[1:00:01] God will let you go on. Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] Because when all of that fell, don't you
[1:00:05] know God will still be right there?
[1:00:07] Hallelujah. And you'll find out
[1:00:08] sometimes it was easier for you to go to
[1:00:10] God and ask God about it. Hallelujah.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that. Right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; That woman with the issues, SHE SPENT
[1:00:18] ALL HER MONEY ALL those years, didn't
[1:00:19] she? Come on. MAYBE SHE WAS BROKE AT THE
[1:00:22] TIME. RIGHT. BUT THEN SHE HEARD JESUS
[1:00:24] WAS PASSING BY. RIGHT. [screaming]
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE CROWD WAS SICK. BUT
[1:00:29] WHAT SHE HAD TO DO WAS PRESS HER WAY
[1:00:31] THROUGH. HALLELUJAH. PRESS HER WAY
[1:00:33] THROUGH THE PAIN. PRESS HER WAY THROUGH
[1:00:35] THE DISCOURAGEMENT. PRESS HER WAY
[1:00:37] THROUGH EVERYBODY SAYING THAT THIS IS
[1:00:39] THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. BUT SHE
[1:00:40] PRESSED HER WAY. HALLELUJAH. And all it
[1:00:43] took was TOUCHING JESUS. HALLELUJAH. OH
[1:00:46] JESUS.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; COME ON. TOUCH HIM.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And you'll be all right. HALLELUJAH. BUT
[1:00:52] HER FAITH WAS [screaming] IN ACTION,
[1:00:53] WASN'T IT,
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; to get through? Come on. I remember one
[1:00:57] night I says, you know, uh, one night I
[1:00:59] I come to church and, you know, uh, I
[1:01:01] know, uh, Charlotte, she can testify. I
[1:01:03] like having a witness. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; She can testify. One night I come home
[1:01:08] from work. I got off work early and my
[1:01:11] stomach was bottom. It had cramps in it
[1:01:13] so bad and all down in my legs and
[1:01:15] everywhere. I couldn't even stand up
[1:01:17] straight. I'm bent over and stomach was
[1:01:20] hurting so bad. Felt like something was
[1:01:22] pulling. I said, "Lord," and Charlotte
[1:01:25] was like, "You need to go to the
[1:01:26] doctor." I says, "You know, we had
[1:01:28] prayer service at night. It was on a
[1:01:30] Tuesday night." I says, "I'm going to go
[1:01:31] to prayer." And I said, you know, she
[1:01:35] said, "You need to go to the doctor." I
[1:01:36] said, "If the Lord don't heal me,
[1:01:38] [laughter]
[1:01:39] then I go to the doctor after church."
[1:01:42] But I believe that God was going to do
[1:01:44] something. Amen. So I pressed my way. I
[1:01:46] come in the building. I was bent over.
[1:01:49] And I remember brother Simmons had he
[1:01:51] said he said, "You all right?" I said,
[1:01:53] "No, I'm not all right. The stomach." So
[1:01:55] he prayed for me and I I got just enough
[1:01:58] just to get down on my knees and pray.
[1:02:00] And after we got done praying, my thing
[1:02:02] was still hurting me so bad. He says,
[1:02:04] "How you feeling, brother Ernest?" And
[1:02:07] then I said, "I still in pain." He said,
[1:02:09] "Everybody, I want everybody to come up
[1:02:10] to the church. Come up to the altar." So
[1:02:13] everybody come up to the altar that
[1:02:15] night. He said, "Brother Sam, I want you
[1:02:17] to pray." And he says, "Brother Gordon,
[1:02:20] lay your hands on his stomach." And as
[1:02:23] brother Sam laid his hands on my head,
[1:02:26] God is my witness for whom I stand. Soon
[1:02:29] as brother Gordon laid his hands on my
[1:02:31] stomach, the pain left before they even
[1:02:33] started praying. I started to start
[1:02:36] shouting right then. Hallelujah. But I
[1:02:38] said, I'mma let him go on through. The
[1:02:40] pain left. Soon as soon as he touched my
[1:02:42] stomach, the pain left. Hallelujah. And
[1:02:44] don't you know that pain ain't never
[1:02:45] came back. Hallelujah. What it was, God
[1:02:48] did his own operation. HALLELUJAH. GOD
[1:02:50] DID the healing, don't he? Didn't he?
[1:02:52] Come on. BUT WHAT IT WAS, FAITH IN
[1:02:54] ACTION. HALLELUJAH. Come on. What you
[1:02:57] got to do? YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IN GOD.
[1:02:59] HALLELUJAH. COME ON. FAITH IN ACTION AND
[1:03:01] WATCH WHAT GOD DO. HALLELUJAH. Somebody
[1:03:04] give God praise this morning. Come on.
[1:03:07] [applause]
[1:03:07] I said faith in action. Come on. I says,
[1:03:10] you know, sometimes what it is, you
[1:03:12] know, we got to we got to believe God,
[1:03:15] right?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I said faith going to give you a good
[1:03:17] report, ain't it?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. You look at sometimes we look
[1:03:20] at these heroes of faith and we say,
[1:03:22] "Oh, look at THE MIGHTY." BUT YOU DON'T
[1:03:24] UNDERSTAND. SOMETIMES WE DON'T look at
[1:03:26] the mountains they had to face, right?
[1:03:29] Or the trials they had to face. But one
[1:03:31] thing, their faith outweighed their
[1:03:33] trials, didn't it?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Their faith was stronger, right? What
[1:03:37] was it? What was it? Their faith was
[1:03:39] stronger because God was stronger.
[1:03:41] Hallelujah. They was believing in a
[1:03:43] higher power than what had them bound.
[1:03:45] Come on. I said, YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY
[1:03:47] DEALING WITH THREE POWERS. That's the
[1:03:49] power of de. The devil. Hallelujah. The
[1:03:51] power of faith and the power of God,
[1:03:53] right? The power of devil going to work
[1:03:55] with these five senses, right? But the
[1:03:57] power of faith works beyond the five
[1:03:59] senses. Hallelujah. Beyond what you can
[1:04:02] see. When the power of faith steps in,
[1:04:04] DON'T YOU KNOW THE POWER OF GOD takes
[1:04:06] over. Hallelujah. And that's what we
[1:04:08] enjoy. Hallelujah. What was we look at
[1:04:10] these heroes of faith? Many of times the
[1:04:13] p the devil, he'll flex his power. He'll
[1:04:15] show you his power. Right? Come on. But
[1:04:18] you faith is something that you can't
[1:04:20] see. But even though you can't see it,
[1:04:22] it's real. It's now faith. Come on. It's
[1:04:24] a substance. It's something real.
[1:04:26] Hallelujah. It ain't something that you
[1:04:28] imagine in your mind, but it's something
[1:04:29] you can have, grab hold to. Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] It's an understanding that you got that
[1:04:33] the doctors don't got. It's an
[1:04:35] understanding you got, your husband
[1:04:36] don't got, your wife don't got. IT'S AN
[1:04:38] UNDERSTANDING. HALLELUJAH. THAT I
[1:04:40] BELIEVE [screaming] GOD WHEN NOBODY ELSE
[1:04:42] DON'T BELIEVE. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:04:44] GOD SPOKE TO ME. HALLELUJAH. AND I
[1:04:47] BELIEVE WHAT GOD [screaming] SAID. OH
[1:04:49] JESUS. LET SARAH LAUGH. BUT YET I
[1:04:52] BELIEVE GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Sarah laughed, didn't she?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; But Abraham believed, didn't he?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; And God sent him a witness, didn't he?
[1:05:03] Melzdc met him and said, "Oh, Abraham,
[1:05:06] servant of the most high God."
[1:05:07] Hallelujah. Come on. I'M JUST HERE TO
[1:05:09] ENCOURAGE YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT THE
[1:05:11] BATTLE YOU JUST WON, GOD WON THAT BATTLE
[1:05:13] FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. GOD FOUGHT YOUR
[1:05:15] BATTLES. HALLELUJAH. AND I'M HERE TO
[1:05:17] TELL YOU, HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD IS GOING
[1:05:20] TO DO [screaming] WHAT HE SAID.
[1:05:21] HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. I can see Abraham
[1:05:25] saying, "Nobody believe ME, BUT I
[1:05:26] BELIEVED ANYHOW." [screaming]
[1:05:27] HALLELUJAH. I TRUSTED IN GOD ANYHOW. AND
[1:05:31] IT WAS ACCOUNTED TO him for
[1:05:32] righteousness, wasn't it? Come on. If I
[1:05:34] got to stand by myself. HALLELUJAH. I'LL
[1:05:37] STAND BY MYSELF. IF I GOT TO PRAISE BY
[1:05:40] MYSELF, I'LL [screaming] PRAISE BY
[1:05:41] MYSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE I MET
[1:05:45] GOD FOR MYSELF. OH, JESUS. I heard the
[1:05:49] voice. Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; But what it was, I said, "The power of
[1:05:54] the devil works on these senses, don't
[1:05:56] it?"
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; You know, the other day I was riding
[1:06:01] down the road. I said, "One thing about
[1:06:03] these five senses, they got such a power
[1:06:06] over our life, don't they?" Come on.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I'll tell y'all what I did. I was riding
[1:06:12] out the road the other day. I said, "I
[1:06:15] want to see how much we need our eyes.
[1:06:17] I'mma close my eyes for a second.
[1:06:19] [laughter]
[1:06:20] for a split second now.
[1:06:23] I was right there by the house. I said,
[1:06:24] "I'mma close my eyes and see if I by
[1:06:26] memory I can see how to get to the
[1:06:28] house." Driving down the road, I open my
[1:06:31] eyes up real quick. I said, "That's how
[1:06:34] important the eyes are, right? I sense."
[1:06:36] But one thing about it, don't you know
[1:06:38] that the the the sense of sight, faith
[1:06:40] is more powerful than that? Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can stop your ears.
[1:06:44] Sense is more powerful. Faith is got
[1:06:47] more powerful than the sense of hearing.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Faith is more powerful. I
[1:06:51] say it's one thing about it. If if if we
[1:06:53] need those five senses just that much,
[1:06:55] right? I said, how much more do we need
[1:06:57] the sense of faith, right? To be able to
[1:07:00] contact and reach God. And that's what I
[1:07:02] says, Lord. Hallelujah. It's got to come
[1:07:04] a time where we got to be able to reach
[1:07:06] you, right? What it is, faith has the
[1:07:09] power over death. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?
[1:07:11] HALLELUJAH. Come on. Death, hell, and
[1:07:13] the grave. Faith to give you power over
[1:07:15] that, right? faith, believing that God,
[1:07:18] hallelujah, he owns all these things,
[1:07:20] right? HE'S IN CONTROL. HOW MANY believe
[1:07:22] that this morning? Come on. I believe
[1:07:24] that. Come on. There's three things that
[1:07:26] WE SAY. THE POWER OF THE DEVIL, THE
[1:07:28] POWER of faith, and the power of God.
[1:07:30] But when you know, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
[1:07:32] THAT THE THE the the Moses and his
[1:07:34] mother, right? You know, ONE THING ABOUT
[1:07:36] IT, THE POWER OF THE DEVIL, WHAT it was,
[1:07:38] TAKE ALL THOSE BOYS and throw them in
[1:07:40] the river, RIGHT? THROW THEM IN THE
[1:07:42] RIVER. All the animals and alligators
[1:07:44] out there. The devil's showing you his
[1:07:46] power. Right? Maybe she look at the
[1:07:48] river. River too high. He can't swim.
[1:07:50] Hallelujah. Even if he could swim, look
[1:07:52] at all the alligators out there, right?
[1:07:54] Look at the hippos or whatever it might
[1:07:56] be out there, right? The devil showing
[1:07:58] you all his power, right? But it WAS
[1:08:00] SOMETHING ABOUT FAITH. HALLELUJAH. Faith
[1:08:02] that they knew THAT IT WAS SOMETHING
[1:08:04] ABOUT THIS CHILD. HALLELUJAH. It was he
[1:08:07] WAS A PROPER CHILD. IT WAS SOMETHING
[1:08:08] ABOUT I BELIEVE THAT GOD IS GOING TO USE
[1:08:10] THIS CHILD. RIGHT. So when the time
[1:08:12] came, what it was THE HER THE POWER OF
[1:08:15] FAITH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN WHEN SHE WHEN
[1:08:17] SHE GOT DOWN TO THAT RIVER, THAT'S WHEN
[1:08:19] FAITH TOOK OVER, RIGHT? SHE TOOK THAT
[1:08:22] CHILD AND PUT HIM IN A BASKET, RIGHT?
[1:08:24] BUT WHEN SHE RELEASED THAT BASKET, WHAT
[1:08:26] TOOK OVER? THE POWER OF GOD TOOK OVER,
[1:08:28] didn't it? Hallelujah. It was no LONGER
[1:08:30] THAT THE DEVIL COULD HAVE HIS power
[1:08:32] because now it was in God's hand.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YOU GOT
[1:08:35] TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR HANDS AND PUT IT

[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; COME ON. But one thing about it, when
[1:10:26] you put it in God's hand,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; it ain't nothing too great for God.
[1:10:30] Hallelujah. I like how God asked uh
[1:10:32] Abraham any of those. He said, "Is there
[1:10:34] anything too hard for the Lord?"
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I asked you that question
[1:10:38] this morning. Is there anything too hard

[1:11:01] Come on. IF YOU DON'T BOW DOWN TO this
[1:11:03] image, we going to throw you in the
[1:11:04] fire. Hallelujah. Maybe they saw the
[1:11:06] fire. Some could feel the heat from the
[1:11:08] fire. But what it was, their faith.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. Their faith was in almighty
[1:11:13] God, right? Though the fire was there in
[1:11:15] front of them, though the threats was
[1:11:17] there, maybe they didn't even hear a
[1:11:19] voice from God, RIGHT? BUT THEY KNEW
[1:11:21] WHAT THEIR GOD WAS CAPABLE OF.
[1:11:22] HALLELUJAH. AND THEY EVEN TESTIFIED OF
[1:11:25] THAT, RIGHT? THEY HAD A TESTIMONY THAT
[1:11:27] PLEASED GOD. HALLELUJAH. THEY SAID THAT
[1:11:29] EVEN IF HE DON'T COME, WE BELIEVE THAT
[1:11:32] HE'S STILL ABLE. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S
[1:11:34] THE WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW. HALLELUJAH. IF
[1:11:37] GOD DON'T SHOW UP, [screaming] HE'S

[1:11:41] MOUNTAIN. HE STILL RAISE THE DEAD. HE
[1:11:43] STILL HEALS THE SICK. EVEN IF

[1:11:46] JESUS. Their testimony pleased God,
[1:11:49] didn't it? Come on. And when the power
[1:11:52] of faith took hold. Hallelujah. They let
[1:11:54] it go. When the power of faith was over
[1:11:56] with, what happened? The power of God
[1:11:58] stepped in, didn't it?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. In the midst of the fire, I can
[1:12:02] see the power of God there. Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] Come on. The fires all around them, but
[1:12:06] they couldn't GET BURNED. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:08] NOT EVEN A HAIR ON THEIR HEAD, not none
[1:12:10] of THEIR CLOTHES, NOTHING COULDN'T get
[1:12:11] burned. What it was, THE POWER OF GOD
[1:12:13] stepped in. Hallelujah. Come on. WALKING
[1:12:16] WALKING WITH A TESTIMONY LIKE THAT. WHAT
[1:12:18] COULD SHAKE YOU? HALLELUJAH. WHAT IT IS,
[1:12:20] YOUR TESTIMONY OUGHT TO BE building you.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. FROM FROM GLORY TO GLORY, HE
[1:12:25] OUGHT TO BE CHANGING YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:27] WHAT GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH ONE
[1:12:28] TESTIMONY THROUGH ANOTHER, YOU OUGHT TO
[1:12:30] BE MOVING. HALLELUJAH. OH JESUS, LITTLE
[1:12:34] BIT HIGHER.

[1:12:37] heart. Hallelujah. David said the lion
[1:12:40] to bear Goliath JUST WHAT IT IS. COME
[1:12:43] ON.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; BRINGING YOU THROUGH. GOD TAKING YOU
[1:12:46] STEP HIGHER AND HIGHER. OH, WHEN I LOOK
[1:12:48] BACK at what God has already done.
[1:12:50] Hallelujah. WHEN I LOOK BACK WHERE GOD
[1:12:52] HAS BROUGHT me from, come on. I SAID
[1:12:54] THIS AIN'T A MOUNTAIN. THAT'S A TEST.

[1:12:58] HIGHER. OH JESUS. How many feel like
[1:13:01] going a little higher this morning? Come
[1:13:03] on. But what it is, it's got to become
[1:13:06] more than just talk.

[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; It's got to become more than just, oh,
[1:13:11] we danced and we shouted. Come on. But
[1:13:13] it's time for fighting now.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's time to let go and let
[1:13:17] God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that you got to let go and let
[1:13:20] God have his way. How many believe that
[1:13:22] this morning? Come on. Faith in action.
[1:13:25] said, "I got faith." He says, "You got
[1:13:26] faith without works." Come on. That's
[1:13:28] dead. He says, "But I got faith, and
[1:13:29] I'mma show you by my works." Right? Cuz
[1:13:32] I'm going to go ahead and start claiming
[1:13:33] those things that that were not as
[1:13:35] though they were. Hallelujah. I'm going
[1:13:36] to go ahead and start speaking it. Call
[1:13:38] me crazy. Call me whatever you want. I'm
[1:13:40] going to go ahead and start speaking it.
[1:13:41] Not only I'm speaking, I'm preparing for
[1:13:43] it. I'm walking in. Hallelujah. Why?
[1:13:45] Because God promised me. And one thing,
[1:13:47] I know that his word don't he can't lie.

[1:13:52] he's God. Hallelujah. Amen.

[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE'S GOD ALL BY HIMSELF, AIN'T
[1:13:59] HE?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Somebody give God
[1:14:02] praise this morning. [applause]
[1:14:04] Oh, Jesus. You know, I says one thing
[1:14:08] about it. God is so good, ain't he?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. So many so many testimonies. I
[1:14:14] says faith in action. So many uh uh
[1:14:17] testimonies, right? So many cloud of
[1:14:20] witnesses. We've got here. You can read
[1:14:22] it sometimes in Hebrews. But like I
[1:14:25] said, it wasn't that they didn't go
[1:14:26] through something, right? They had
[1:14:29] mighty trials,
[1:14:31] but what overcame was their faith,
[1:14:33] right?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Somewhere along the line, they learned
[1:14:36] to trust in Jesus. Come on. Somewhere
[1:14:40] along the line, you know, I was talking
[1:14:42] to one of my uncles once and before he
[1:14:44] passed some years ago and he was sick
[1:14:47] and he says, he says, he called me
[1:14:49] Jermaine. said, "Jermaine, you do you do
[1:14:51] you think God can heal me?" I said, "I
[1:14:54] know God can heal you." I says, "But
[1:14:57] will he heal you?" I said, "That's up to
[1:14:59] him." I says, "But one thing about it,
[1:15:02] let me talk to you about faith."
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. I said, "The same faith that
[1:15:06] you had when you got saved." I says,
[1:15:09] "You gave your heart to the Lord and all
[1:15:12] of a sudden you just begin to telling
[1:15:13] everybody, "I'm saved. I'm saved. I'm
[1:15:15] saved." Right? I said, "Until you walk
[1:15:17] right into it." Hallelujah. You kept
[1:15:20] confessing it, right? And the more you
[1:15:22] confess, things dropped off your life.
[1:15:24] You walked into it, right? I said that's
[1:15:26] the same thing with healing. You got to
[1:15:28] confess it. Hallelujah. You can't keep
[1:15:30] walking around saying, "I feel. I feel.
[1:15:32] I feel because faith don't go by
[1:15:34] feeling." Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Faith is the things that we the rust
[1:15:37] touch the thing that's unseen. Right? I
[1:15:39] said you got to walk and say, "I'm
[1:15:41] healed." Hallelujah. And you ain't
[1:15:42] telling no lie. How you say I ain't
[1:15:44] telling no lie? He says because with his
[1:15:46] stripes you are healed. Hallelujah. He
[1:15:48] healed you already when he died on
[1:15:50] Calvary. Hallelujah. Don't you know that
[1:15:52] the work was finished? What I need you
[1:15:54] to do is walk around and say, "I'm
[1:15:55] healed." Hallelujah. I'm healed. I don't
[1:15:57] want to hear no. Come on. Faith got a
[1:15:59] good report. I don't want to hear no
[1:16:01] evil report. I'm healed. I'm blessed.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. I might be fighting, but I'm
[1:16:05] blessed. I'm healed. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:16:07] victorious. Walk. KEEP WALKING UNTIL YOU
[1:16:10] WALK into it. Hallelujah. Somebody give
[1:16:12] God praise. Amen. [applause]
[1:16:16] I said, "That's what you got to do."
[1:16:18] Amen. You got to walk into it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to walk. Some people
[1:16:24] don't know what I'm talking about. But
[1:16:26] you got to walk into it. Come on. When
[1:16:30] you're speaking faith in action, what am
[1:16:32] I doing walking into it? Those children
[1:16:35] of Israel, hallelujah, when they got to
[1:16:37] the land and they said, "Oh, the enemies
[1:16:39] there, right?" But they knew that God
[1:16:41] gave them a promise, right? Every place
[1:16:43] the soul of your foot touch, I'mma give
[1:16:44] it to you. Right? So what they had to
[1:16:46] do, they had to walk into it, didn't
[1:16:48] they? And everywhere they walked, though
[1:16:50] the enemy might have seemed like it was
[1:16:51] large, this land belonged to me.
[1:16:53] Hallelujah. THIS GROUND BELONGED TO ME.
[1:16:55] WHY? BECAUSE I STEPPED on it and God
[1:16:57] promised it to me. Hallelujah. So I'm
[1:16:59] walking into it. Hallelujah. I'm walking
[1:17:01] into it. My healing. I'm walking into my
[1:17:03] deliverance. I'm walking into the
[1:17:04] promise. What it is, YOU GOT TO WALK.
[1:17:06] HALLELUJAH. WALK into it. Oh Jesus.
[1:17:10] Sometimes you got to do that. I said
[1:17:12] faith in action. Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; See the enemy trying to take your voice.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; But I believe God got something he want
[1:17:19] to say.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I believe that God can say
[1:17:22] what he want to say. Hallelujah. One
[1:17:24] thing about it, the devil tried to shut
[1:17:26] God's mouth, but he can't never do that.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. He thought he had him when
[1:17:30] he took him down in the grave.
[1:17:31] Hallelujah. But he didn't realize that
[1:17:33] at the third day. Hallelujah. He was
[1:17:35] going to rise, but this time with all
[1:17:37] power. Hallelujah. Death was going to
[1:17:39] lose his sting. Hallelujah. And it
[1:17:41] wasn't going to BE NOTHING THAT HOLD
[1:17:42] OVER YOU AND I.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN HE send the spirit back,
[1:17:45] how many thank God for that this
[1:17:47] morning? Come on. We talking about faith

[1:27:52] Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] Father, in the precious name of Jesus
[1:27:56] Christ,
[1:27:59] you said it was finished that day on
[1:28:01] Calvary.
[1:28:04] And Lord, I believe that you rose the
[1:28:07] third day
[1:28:09] and you had the keys of death and hell.
[1:28:11] [music]
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:14] You rose victoriously.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And you said, "If I be lifted up, I'll
[1:28:20] draw all men."
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Father, today, Lord God, we know you've
[1:28:25] been lifted up high above
[1:28:29] all our circumstances, all of our
[1:28:31] conditions.
[1:28:33] All of our fears and all of our doubts,
[1:28:36] you have been lifted up
[1:28:39] high above all of that.
[1:28:43] [music] And why don't you say,
[1:28:45] I believe God today.
[1:28:48] And God, I'm going to take you at your
[1:28:49] word. I trust you. [music]
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; If you receive Jesus Christ today,
[1:28:56] then your victory is in Christ.
[1:29:00] So accept your victory today.

[1:29:05] the savior and as lord of your life,
[1:29:09] your healer, your deliverer.
[1:29:13] He's Jehovah Gyar that supplies every
[1:29:16] need. He's Jehovah Roth that health all
[1:29:19] of our diseases.
[1:29:22] Why don't you accept it today
[1:29:25] as our heads are bowed, hearts are
[1:29:26] looking to him. If you don't know him as
[1:29:29] Lord and Savior of your life, why don't
