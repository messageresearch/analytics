[38:04] amen
[38:06] God is good amen
[38:08] we want to look at the book of Ephesians
[38:10] 1.
[38:11] by the grace of God
[38:18] amen
[38:27] Ephesians 1 and
[38:30] very familiar scripture was started the
[38:33] first verse
[38:34] you gotta say Amen
[38:37] and it reads Paul and the Apostle of
[38:40] Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
[38:43] Saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[38:46] faithful in Christ Jesus you may be
[38:49] seated I'm gonna read a little further
[38:50] down
[38:51] the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to
[38:55] you and peace from our from God our
[38:58] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:01] blessed be the God and father of our
[39:03] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[39:05] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[39:08] places in Christ according as he have
[39:11] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[39:14] of the world that we should be holy and
[39:17] Without Blame before him in love having
[39:20] predestinated us into the adoption of
[39:22] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[39:25] according to the good pleasure of his
[39:27] will to the praise of of the glory of
[39:31] Glory of his grace wherein he have made
[39:34] us accepted in the Beloved in whom we
[39:37] have Redemption through his blood the
[39:40] Forgiveness of our of sins according to
[39:42] the riches of his grace wherein he hath
[39:45] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[39:48] Prudence having made known unto us the
[39:50] mixture of his will according to his
[39:53] good pleasure which he have purposed in
[39:55] himself that in a dispensation of the
[39:58] fullness of times he might gather
[40:00] together in one all things in Christ
[40:03] both which are in heaven and which are
[40:07] on earth even in him may God have bless
[40:10] the reading of his word tonight by the
[40:13] grace of God just for a moment we want
[40:15] to minister on a topic and I entitled it
[40:18] before the foundation amen
[40:21] before the foundation looking here in
[40:24] the fourth verse and how he's saying
[40:26] according as as he have chosen Us in him
[40:30] before the foundation of the world so so
[40:34] I want to talk about tonight before the
[40:36] foundation you know thank God and here
[40:39] just reading over these scriptures and I
[40:42] like how you know Paul was such a humble
[40:44] character even though in life
[40:47] uh in US in achievements and things he
[40:50] could have seen the at some point walk
[40:52] Head and Shoulders above some of the
[40:54] others but yet he he developed such a
[40:59] humble uh humility Spirit when when
[41:01] Christ got hold to him and it was
[41:04] because he had to recognize that you
[41:06] know even in all of his speeches and all
[41:08] his writings he talks about the grace of
[41:11] God especially here in Ephesians and
[41:13] talk about how the grace of God and the
[41:15] grace of God and he has chosen us it's
[41:17] by his grace it's by his grace so just
[41:20] looking at those things and and it's all
[41:22] you know pointing to to what he has done
[41:25] and I was beginning to think you know
[41:27] looking at it I says you know what what
[41:29] it is you and I we can look at our lives
[41:32] and and and how we've uh come a long way
[41:36] God has brought us a long way a mighty
[41:39] Long Way amen and how he's brought us
[41:41] along and we can look at the Times past
[41:43] and the mind frame that you had in times
[41:46] past and the lifestyle you model lived
[41:48] in times past and then you you start
[41:50] taking account of you know the mind
[41:52] frame you are now where you're sitting
[41:54] at now and you can look and say God is
[41:56] God has transitioned he's brought me a
[41:58] mighty long way and he ain't done with
[42:00] me yet but you begin to look at that
[42:03] sometimes and you can say to yourself
[42:05] how did I get here how how did I become
[42:09] what I am today but you know this ain't
[42:12] something that just started yesterday
[42:14] but this was before the foundations of
[42:18] the world before the world even began
[42:20] before the world was even formed God
[42:23] already had these things planned out in
[42:25] his mind he already had our paths set he
[42:28] already had the road established before
[42:31] the before like I said the foundation of
[42:34] the world before the foundation before
[42:36] it was even established before it was
[42:38] even formed God already had his thoughts
[42:40] you were already in his mind then at
[42:43] that place he already saw you he knew
[42:46] your flaws he knew what the the battles
[42:47] you'd have to fight he know the struggle
[42:49] but he know the road you'd have to take
[42:51] because he's the one that set that road
[42:54] so in that you know you looking at you
[42:57] says sometimes you know how did I how
[43:00] did I get her and all these things but
[43:02] then you begin to look and say it's not
[43:05] me but it's Christ that done these
[43:08] things I got nothing to Glory about
[43:10] except for if I Glory I want to glory in
[43:13] him you know somebody uh was talking
[43:16] today at the job and I was telling them
[43:18] about a situation that's like Ernest
[43:20] they said see they said you took the
[43:22] humble approach
[43:24] they said if I was you this is what I
[43:26] would have said and he was saying I
[43:28] would have said it like this because I'm
[43:30] Earnest that's what he said and I said
[43:32] the thing is I started laughing we both
[43:34] had to laugh I said it's not that I'm
[43:36] I'm taking the humble approach I said
[43:39] but the thing is I I recognize that God
[43:42] is in control of everything
[43:44] God is in control of every every
[43:46] situation I say God God I'm gonna let
[43:49] God handle things because he already got
[43:51] all this caught us by surprise but it
[43:54] didn't catch God by surprise he already
[43:56] knew that that trial would come that
[43:58] situation would come that destination be
[44:00] there and he's just he he want you and I
[44:03] uh to trust him he want you and I when
[44:06] we see these things we face with these
[44:08] things to realize that hey it's God that
[44:11] brought me it's God that brought me here
[44:13] and I'm not I'm not worried about these
[44:14] situations these trials I'm gonna let
[44:16] God I'm gonna let God handle them
[44:18] because it's him it's him I like how in
[44:21] the book of uh John how Jesus was
[44:24] beginning to say it because John 15 he
[44:26] said ye have not chosen me he says but I
[44:29] I've chosen you
[44:31] he said you ain't chose me but I chose
[44:34] you not only that he said but I ordained
[44:37] you that you might uh bring forth fruit
[44:40] you won't be unfruitful not only did I
[44:42] chose you but I ordained you that you're
[44:44] gonna bring forth fruit and then he says
[44:47] he goes on to say and the fruit that
[44:49] you're going to bring forth they're
[44:50] gonna remain
[44:51] I begin thinking about that in prayer I
[44:53] said Lord my spirits start to get
[44:55] started stirred I said you know what God
[44:57] has ordained us to bring forth fruit we
[45:00] didn't show we didn't choose him he
[45:02] chose us
[45:03] not only did he chose us but he ordained
[45:06] us to bring forth fruit so when the
[45:08] fruit come you don't have to worry about
[45:09] the wind shaking the tree come on
[45:11] because God said that that fruit will
[45:14] remain you don't have to worry about the
[45:16] storm nobody cutting the tree down
[45:18] nobody cutting the limbs off in the
[45:19] fruit come on he said but what I
[45:21] ordained you to bring forth fruit right
[45:23] he said and those fruit gonna remain
[45:26] so I said let the winds and all that
[45:28] blow God give us fruit that nobody can
[45:31] take away God give us something that
[45:33] even though it might look like it fell
[45:35] off all God doing is purging it that he
[45:37] can bring forth more and the next time
[45:39] gonna be more in abundance than it was
[45:41] the first time it'll be even greater why
[45:43] because God don't have two things
[45:46] Hallelujah I said that I said that's
[45:48] what it is God he said he let him know I
[45:51] chose you and I I want to encourage you
[45:54] I chose you come on you didn't just
[45:56] happen to be here on your own before the
[45:58] foundation of the world I chose you
[46:00] I could already write your name there
[46:02] you already overcome you're already
[46:04] Victorious you got battles and struggles
[46:07] you got to fight you might look at
[46:09] yourself uh sometimes as Gideon looked
[46:11] at itself and but when God looked at him
[46:14] what did he say to him come on you're a
[46:16] mighty man of Valor get in can look and
[46:19] say hey me I'm a mighty how are you
[46:21] gonna say I'm a mighty man of Valor and
[46:23] I'm sitting here hiding from my enemies
[46:25] every time I get a blessing the Devil
[46:28] come take it away
[46:29] so I got to hide it I got to run and
[46:31] worry about whether the devil gonna come
[46:33] tonight and steal my joy come on here
[46:35] how you gonna call me a mighty man of
[46:37] Valor as a matter of fact if God be with
[46:40] us then weigh all his miracles at come
[46:41] on but nevertheless in all of that he
[46:45] know he was just in himself at the time
[46:47] and what he was going through and
[46:48] sometimes that happens even to the
[46:51] greatest of of we look at the the
[46:54] children of God sometimes that happen to
[46:56] the greatest of Warriors they get in
[46:58] themselves sometimes and they can they
[46:59] all alone and all that but something has
[47:02] to come and most of the time it's
[47:03] through the word to stir you up and
[47:05] encourage you that hey you you looking
[47:07] at these things because you you you're
[47:10] somewhere along the line throughout all
[47:12] out of all the victories you got in
[47:14] yourself a little bit
[47:15] and all the victory somewhere along the
[47:17] line you forgot that it wasn't your
[47:19] strength but it was me behind your mouth
[47:21] that hand the whole time
[47:23] when I'm behind that hand it ain't your
[47:25] hand but it's a mighty hand and the only
[47:27] thing that makes that hand Mighty is
[47:29] because God is behind it Hallelujah so
[47:32] we find that ourselves you know he says
[47:34] you I've chosen you and our danger and I
[47:36] like how he goes on to say this at Saint
[47:38] John 15 he goes on to say that now our
[47:41] danger he said and that anything you ask
[47:44] of my father he'll give it to you
[47:47] not only did I chose you and our danger
[47:50] to bring forth fruit come on and they
[47:52] gonna remain but I also set it up to
[47:55] where anything you ask of my father
[47:58] he gonna give it to you oh that
[48:00] encourages us tonight and I said you
[48:02] know what as I was praying I said we
[48:04] have not because we ask not because
[48:07] Jesus said that he made it that we can
[48:10] ask anything of his father and he'll
[48:12] give it to us I said I'm gonna start
[48:14] asking Hallelujah ask for big things why
[48:17] because he's a big God ain't he
[48:19] sometimes we sit there and we we jealous
[48:22] of other people and what they have maybe
[48:24] they've been asking God maybe they
[48:26] realize that God he he set it up like he
[48:29] says that you can ask my father anything
[48:31] he'll give it to you that's the way I
[48:33] made it I ordained it that way
[48:35] I blessed you come on not just didn't
[48:39] just start now because you have some
[48:40] faithful memory are you some good uh boy
[48:43] or girl but before the foundation of the
[48:46] world before the world was formed you
[48:48] was in my mind Hallelujah everybody
[48:51] looking at your faults and where you're
[48:52] at and all those things he says but
[48:54] before the foundation of the world I
[48:57] already saw you coming Hallelujah I knew
[48:59] you'd come and I set it up that you're
[49:01] gonna be blessed you're gonna walk like
[49:03] kings in the earth hallelujah oh Jesus
[49:07] come on but before the foundation you
[49:10] know he says that he said you can ask
[49:11] anything then I but I like how he goes
[49:13] on to say he said but but one
[49:15] commandment I'm gonna give you that you
[49:17] love one another
[49:19] then he went to talking about love and
[49:21] how the world gonna hate you
[49:24] come on say the world gonna hate you say
[49:26] it but I want you to remember one thing
[49:27] that when the world hates you remember
[49:30] he hated me first come on but if but if
[49:34] if the world love you remember you might
[49:37] not be part of him
[49:39] but when the world hates you and rejects
[49:42] you don't feel bad about it remember
[49:44] they hated me and they rejected me
[49:47] but in all of the hate you feel blessed
[49:50] and all of the rejection
[49:52] come on
[49:54] all of the standing alone might be
[49:57] Vineyards and and forests or trees and
[50:00] ain't none unfruitful dried up come on
[50:03] but it might be a tree somewhere in the
[50:05] desert by itself
[50:07] say how is that tree thriving because
[50:09] it's an oasis down there you can't see
[50:11] the water but down in the dirt
[50:14] in The Roots
[50:16] come on it's water that's life something
[50:18] coming up Hallelujah y'all like that
[50:22] God can do those things though can he
[50:24] come on you say it but I I say one of
[50:26] the things we got to understand you
[50:28] don't want you uh get saved you know
[50:31] Lord Savior and all you know it's a
[50:33] battle it ain't it ain't an easy Road
[50:35] come on it ain't the easy Road I said
[50:37] but the thing I said you know I was
[50:39] looking at some things and you know uh
[50:41] our Lord uh brought me in coming up and
[50:44] I says but you gotta you gotta
[50:47] understand one of the things you got to
[50:49] quit wrestling with is that you you
[50:51] belong to God you don't belong to the
[50:53] devil
[50:54] you got to quit wrestling with that I
[50:57] belong to God
[50:58] come on and all God promises if I belong
[51:01] to him all I'm subject to all those
[51:03] promises everything he said I'm I'm
[51:05] Victorious I'm a conqueror I'm a I'm a
[51:08] warrior I'm a battle I'm a fight I'm I'm
[51:10] overcoming why because he overcame these
[51:12] things
[51:13] come on
[51:15] I thought that little scripture today uh
[51:18] the battle ain't your that's what I was
[51:19] saying my friend he said Ernest father
[51:21] did this I said you know I should have
[51:23] said I should have said but the Bible
[51:24] say come on
[51:26] that the battle ain't yours hallelujah
[51:28] it's whose it's God's ain't it
[51:31] and I believe that you know I says but
[51:34] what it is we got to quit wrestling you
[51:35] gotta you know I was sharing with my uh
[51:38] family the other night and how me and
[51:40] somebody was riding together I didn't
[51:42] say who it was we were riding together
[51:43] when it was uh teenagers and uh I was a
[51:46] teenager then they was older than me it
[51:48] was riding in the car and they told me
[51:49] they said you know you know we going to
[51:52] hell right that's what they told me
[51:54] and I look I said no I ain't going
[51:57] and they looked at me they said
[52:00] they said Jermaine so you know it's
[52:01] about the fabulous Jermaine
[52:04] they said so you think with all the bad
[52:07] we doing you going you ain't going to
[52:09] hell like that I said I ain't going he
[52:11] said see the problem is you didn't you
[52:14] ain't accepted see I don't accept it he
[52:16] said you gotta accept it
[52:17] come on
[52:19] but
[52:20] oh it didn't matter how bad we were
[52:22] doing at the time in my heart I still
[52:25] wanted God
[52:26] in my heart I didn't want to go to hell
[52:28] I wanted to go to heaven come on so even
[52:32] like I says
[52:33] in the midst of all that the devil
[52:37] can come to you use people come to you
[52:39] however and say hey
[52:42] you know you've gone too far I told
[52:45] somebody how you know you ain't going
[52:47] too far because it's still a desire
[52:48] there
[52:49] it's still something I don't care how
[52:51] bad you might think you you fell off or
[52:53] you gone but it's still a desire in
[52:56] there to do right it's still a desire in
[52:58] there that you want to please God it's
[53:00] still a desire still a something in
[53:02] there that want God and I say what you
[53:04] got to do you got to do the best that
[53:05] you know how
[53:07] do do all you know and God's gonna do
[53:10] the rest come on you can't save yourself
[53:13] you can't do it you you can't fight your
[53:16] own battles like it says I don't have to
[53:19] go to hell because he went there for me
[53:21] I don't have to go he went down there he
[53:23] took my place
[53:25] Hallelujah I didn't know it at the time
[53:27] but I found out one day when I wanted to
[53:30] get out of the mess that I was in I
[53:32] wanted to I wanted something to change
[53:34] in my life I was tired of living for the
[53:37] devil tired of of doing those things
[53:39] that seem to be Pleasures but was
[53:42] miserable on the inside lonely
[53:44] wanted God
[53:46] Hallelujah didn't know how to break out
[53:48] but I'm so glad that when I got to that
[53:51] place I said Lord if you help me
[53:54] that's what I said
[53:56] in a Motel 6 Lord if you help me get out
[53:59] of this place I
[54:01] I can to serve you all the days of my
[54:03] life God knows that he reached down
[54:06] right there Hallelujah did something for
[54:08] me wasn't never was perfect come on but
[54:12] little little and little he began to
[54:14] prosper me little and little he began to
[54:17] show me that if you lean on me
[54:19] Hallelujah I'll fight all your battles
[54:21] literally little he began to show me
[54:23] those things come on
[54:25] oh and he ain't done with me yet
[54:28] I'm still pressing on but what it is the
[54:31] more uh the more he does for me the more
[54:33] you recognize that it ain't about me
[54:35] it's about him the devil come to you
[54:38] that's a great test a big old test now
[54:40] what you're going to do the same God
[54:42] that brought me out the little star is
[54:44] going to bring me out these big storms
[54:45] he ain't doing nothing but perfecting me
[54:48] Hallelujah my faith is in him come on
[54:51] where's your faith today is your faith
[54:53] in him come on because what it is I I
[54:56] said I had this little saying the other
[54:58] week uh I said God saw you coming
[55:01] Hallelujah he saw you coming he knows
[55:04] who you are I said this something it's
[55:06] new to you but God saw this day coming
[55:09] now I saw you coming before he told uh
[55:12] Jeremiah before you was formed in your
[55:14] mother's womb I already knew you didn't
[55:17] and he said I I ordained you
[55:20] come on this ain't something you done if
[55:23] it was something you done then you can
[55:24] worry about losing it you can worry
[55:26] about it being taken away but when you
[55:28] didn't do it when you recognized it
[55:31] wasn't me but it was the mighty hand of
[55:32] God
[55:33] it was God himself that done it
[55:36] Hallelujah that was saying he took our
[55:39] place it was God that didn't when we
[55:41] stand before God you can't stand before
[55:43] him in your righteousness it says filthy
[55:46] rags
[55:47] you can't stand before him and nothing
[55:49] good you done
[55:50] or any or any of those things money
[55:52] can't buy your way out can it
[55:55] but you're gonna need something that
[55:57] supersedes anything that on this Earth
[55:59] they can give you and it's only one
[56:01] thing and that's the blood of Jesus
[56:02] Christ the bleeding lamb he did the
[56:05] things that we couldn't do I like that
[56:07] little song he paid the price that I
[56:09] couldn't pay hallelujah oh He Paid a
[56:11] Debt he couldn't know y'all know the
[56:13] song
[56:14] he paid it didn't he I was telling them
[56:17] the other day I said Mike can't sing it
[56:18] but I could preach it the songs amen but
[56:22] I said it's what it is I'm stirred about
[56:24] these things why because see the devil
[56:26] what it is you you got to recognize that
[56:29] you don't you belong to God come on
[56:31] before the foundation this ain't nothing
[56:33] that just started come on God judging
[56:36] you uh uh now now you know that we know
[56:39] how we know we ain't gonna go too far to
[56:41] the left or to the right but I said that
[56:43] you know you're looking at yourself like
[56:45] oh oh today tomorrow how I'm gonna do it
[56:47] come on ain't how I'm gonna do it this
[56:49] started before the world began
[56:51] before he I like how Paul said he chose
[56:54] us in him
[56:56] come on he chose us
[56:58] he chose me out of all that he could
[57:01] have used he chose me I'm not can't walk
[57:04] Head and Shoulders above nobody and says
[57:06] hey I'm the children no we could but I
[57:09] said the thing is it still ain't but
[57:11] what you did it's what Christ did
[57:13] it's what he did God picks and I'm glad
[57:16] that he does that he picks the violence
[57:18] of people don't he he don't pick the
[57:20] perfect people because there is none but
[57:23] he picks that one that knows he's
[57:25] insufficient no he didn't have no he was
[57:28] lost without hope no he didn't have a
[57:30] way out
[57:32] didn't have a business coming in the
[57:34] house of God he went to him though
[57:36] didn't he he brought the kingdom of God
[57:38] to him and they enjoyed it why because
[57:41] they were the chosen of God I like I I
[57:43] thank God for that tonight how many
[57:45] thank God for his choosing tonight come
[57:47] on I said before the foundation of the
[57:50] world like he told Jeremiah he said I
[57:52] chose you he says he said for your for
[57:55] your mother using for your mother's
[57:57] belly I already knew you
[57:59] I saw you coming
[58:01] come on and I know that you know you're
[58:04] going to have opposition you say I'm a
[58:07] child you said don't say that that don't
[58:09] mean nothing when God is for you when
[58:11] God is for you no matter who you are how
[58:13] big you are what color you are or any of
[58:15] those things when God is for you nobody
[58:17] can't be against you come on if God be
[58:20] for us who can be against us ain't that
[58:22] what the scripture says come on no
[58:24] matter how much money you got and all
[58:26] those things God is for you come on and
[58:28] he owned every cattle on the hill he's
[58:31] Almighty sitting on the throne come on
[58:34] giving rose with all power
[58:37] so no matter what the opposition is look
[58:40] look at look at who who's telling you
[58:42] hey I'm the one backing you I'm the one
[58:45] I'm doing it you didn't it didn't just
[58:47] start like we said before the foundation
[58:49] for years for under your mother's womb I
[58:51] already set you above Kings I already
[58:53] set you above Kingdom this day don't be
[58:55] afraid of their faces but I just want
[58:57] you to go out and speak my word I want
[58:59] you to go out and tell them what I tell
[59:01] you to say that's all I want
[59:03] come on
[59:04] I like how you know in Jeremiah Was was
[59:08] talking
[59:09] here I think it was Jeremiah 20 and 7
[59:12] and he was saying you can go home and
[59:13] read it sometimes he was saying uh to
[59:16] himself when he was in prison one day
[59:18] and he was saying Lord he says you
[59:21] deceive me
[59:22] he said you deceive me he says because
[59:25] you told me that they wouldn't Prevail
[59:27] but they have prevailed against me you
[59:30] told me that you put me above them but
[59:31] ever since I began speaking in your name
[59:33] just paraphrasing it I ain't been having
[59:35] nothing but trouble people been mocking
[59:38] me he says but you but Lord you said
[59:40] that you that that I wouldn't be I
[59:43] wouldn't uh be uh they weren't prevailed
[59:46] against me that's what you said let's
[59:48] look at it Jeremiah 20 by the grace of
[59:50] God I was trying to paraphrase it but
[59:52] I'm slipping all over it Jeremiah 20 and
[59:55] 7. come on God is good tonight ain't he
[59:58] before the foundation
[1:00:01] that's one thing like I said we gotta we
[1:00:04] got to come to the Reckoning if you if
[1:00:07] you come to that reckon and that hey I
[1:00:09] belong to God come on
[1:00:11] nothing the devil can do
[1:00:13] the change God's mind about you
[1:00:17] you know he says I know my thoughts
[1:00:19] concerning Israel right he said and
[1:00:21] they're good and not evil I know I know
[1:00:24] nothing the way God saw you it's nothing
[1:00:27] that can uh nothing that anybody can do
[1:00:30] or any say that can change his mind
[1:00:32] sometimes you say Lord like Moses oh you
[1:00:34] picked the wrong one it wasn't me but no
[1:00:36] God knows exactly who who it was he knew
[1:00:39] what was in Moses because he had already
[1:00:41] ordained it right and no matter how much
[1:00:43] he kicked against and didn't want it
[1:00:44] nevertheless God already knew what was
[1:00:47] in him God already like was uh brother
[1:00:49] Josh was teaching in the Bible study of
[1:00:51] the image you know that that was in
[1:00:53] Michelangelo's mind just like God
[1:00:55] already envisioned you when he saw you
[1:00:57] he saw you even in all your flaws and
[1:00:59] all those things he saw you he ordained
[1:01:02] it that way he made you that way come on
[1:01:04] but nevertheless in all of that he was
[1:01:06] going to bring you out perfect
[1:01:08] how
[1:01:10] from through the blood shed blood of
[1:01:12] Jesus Christ not nothing you done but
[1:01:15] when you was lost without hope here come
[1:01:17] the savior when you was lost without
[1:01:19] hope Harry is riding on the cloud come
[1:01:22] on
[1:01:23] Heck on the Savior coming that when you
[1:01:26] held your head down and you said I'm
[1:01:28] lost but here come the Savior come on at
[1:01:31] that place your Lords in life at that
[1:01:33] lower spot that lowest moment hey come
[1:01:36] the Savior to let you know that there is
[1:01:38] hope how There's Hope in Christ you
[1:01:41] messed it all up you made a mess of it
[1:01:43] but I'm here to show you that in your
[1:01:46] mess that was in my plans the whole time
[1:01:48] because I'ma bring Perfection out of the
[1:01:51] mess I'm gonna bring a testimony out of
[1:01:53] the mess come on
[1:01:55] I'ma win Victory is out of the mess out
[1:01:58] of your mess gonna come testimonies
[1:02:01] that's gonna sack the world on fire out
[1:02:03] of your mess Hallelujah oh Jesus
[1:02:06] so it wasn't you but it was God that did
[1:02:09] those things then you can learn like
[1:02:12] Paul said in one place he said we all
[1:02:14] walk that way in times past he says but
[1:02:17] God come on who was rich in Mercy we all
[1:02:20] walk that way we felt bad about it but
[1:02:23] God who was rich in Mercy where where he
[1:02:26] loved us
[1:02:27] I thank God that he loved me when
[1:02:30] everybody walked and they said they
[1:02:33] loved you but but the action's so
[1:02:34] different come on let's be real
[1:02:38] people say they love you from their
[1:02:40] mouth but the action's so different
[1:02:41] don't it but it's something about God he
[1:02:44] don't just give mouth service like that
[1:02:46] but God's love is felt hallelujah it's
[1:02:49] genuine it's firm oh
[1:02:52] yes it is come on I believe that tonight
[1:02:56] Jesus Jeremiah 20 and 7.
[1:03:01] you gotta say man
[1:03:03] he says here in seventh verse Oh Lord
[1:03:06] thou has deceived me and I was deceived
[1:03:10] Thou Art stronger than I and has
[1:03:12] profiled I am in derision daily everyone
[1:03:16] mockets me but since I speak and I cried
[1:03:19] up I cried out I cried violence and
[1:03:22] spoiled because the word of the Lord was
[1:03:25] made of approaching to me and in the
[1:03:27] derision daily then I said I will not
[1:03:30] make mention of him nor speak any more
[1:03:34] in his name come on but Jeremiah you
[1:03:37] know I can see like I said God told him
[1:03:39] you know I already set you it was a good
[1:03:41] salutation right because God told him
[1:03:44] I'd have made you I set you above Kings
[1:03:46] and kingdoms come on
[1:03:49] I made you above all them don't be
[1:03:51] afraid of them you Victorious you're on
[1:03:53] the mountain you Kings I set you above
[1:03:55] all those things but somewhere along the
[1:03:57] line
[1:03:58] after being uh beaten thrown in jail fed
[1:04:02] with bread Affliction all those things
[1:04:04] and suffering and going through and
[1:04:06] being rejected of me and his family
[1:04:08] everybody walk away from them
[1:04:10] hit in the mouth and all those things
[1:04:12] right somewhere along the line he's he
[1:04:14] began to think about the promise that
[1:04:16] God made him and said Lord you said that
[1:04:20] you set me above you said
[1:04:23] that I'll be a problem he said but you
[1:04:25] deceived me that's how he got in himself
[1:04:26] didn't he
[1:04:27] because I'm I'm here bound going through
[1:04:31] trials he never said you wouldn't have
[1:04:33] trials and tribulations he never said
[1:04:35] that storms would come did he but he
[1:04:38] said he'd be there when they did I like
[1:04:40] that he never said that you wouldn't
[1:04:42] have to fight but he said that every
[1:04:44] place a soul on your foot tried upon
[1:04:46] I'll give it to you Hallelujah you're
[1:04:49] gonna have to fight but I'm gonna give
[1:04:50] you the victory oh Jesus
[1:04:53] wouldn't have to fight right but we get
[1:04:56] that mixed up sometimes don't we we
[1:04:58] believe that because we the chosen of
[1:05:00] God and God is your father and your king
[1:05:03] son sometimes you ain't gonna have to go
[1:05:05] through but no that's even the more
[1:05:07] ain't it
[1:05:08] remember because you rejected of all men
[1:05:11] rejected of the world yes God has given
[1:05:15] you veteran in all those things then he
[1:05:17] began to save but but in the very next
[1:05:19] verse he began to say but his word was
[1:05:21] was like it was so in my heart it was
[1:05:24] like fired I was shut up in my bones and
[1:05:26] they began to talk about those things
[1:05:27] and even begin to glorify God because
[1:05:30] even in the midst of all of that you
[1:05:33] know he realized that that God ain't
[1:05:35] left from God was still there because
[1:05:37] what he was prophesying was the truth
[1:05:40] you know he was hated because he told
[1:05:42] them the truth Hallelujah he was hated
[1:05:45] because he told them that if you didn't
[1:05:48] get right come on the Babylonians was
[1:05:51] coming
[1:05:52] you don't straighten out
[1:05:53] they gonna take the city and burn it
[1:05:55] with fire and they hated them didn't
[1:05:58] they and they knew they was doing wrong
[1:05:59] but yet they hated them didn't they and
[1:06:02] it seemed like he suffered for them but
[1:06:04] no he didn't suffer he was right there
[1:06:06] in the will of God wasn't he he suffered
[1:06:08] but he was right there in the will of
[1:06:10] God he was right there doing well in in
[1:06:13] the end Hallelujah he can look back and
[1:06:15] say God you never failed me
[1:06:18] middle in a minute that album you were
[1:06:20] still there
[1:06:21] when destruction came I was saved why
[1:06:25] because God kept This Promise didn't he
[1:06:28] Hallelujah I like that I said the thing
[1:06:31] is you know sometimes you know we
[1:06:35] believe that come on that even though
[1:06:37] it's for the foundation of the world
[1:06:39] things we chosen of God that we won't
[1:06:41] have to go through nothing
[1:06:43] but like I said even the more because
[1:06:45] what is what is God doing God is
[1:06:48] perfecting us ain't he
[1:06:50] God is perfecting us he's bringing I
[1:06:52] wrote some things down you know he's
[1:06:55] bringing some some things out of us you
[1:06:57] know and and he's bringing things out of
[1:07:00] us because he wants to perfect us he he
[1:07:02] knows it's a place in his mind before
[1:07:05] the foundation in the world he saw us
[1:07:06] it's a place in a Perfection there you
[1:07:09] know I was I was sharing with uh the
[1:07:12] church I was saying you know coming up
[1:07:14] and I can look at all your friends and
[1:07:16] all those things and but some of us came
[1:07:19] to certain Crossroads in life and maybe
[1:07:21] those roads LED down four or five
[1:07:23] different lanes and somebody might have
[1:07:26] took off down this Lane I was I was just
[1:07:28] going in prayer going about it but I
[1:07:31] started preaching on it by saying maybe
[1:07:33] you know the crowd could have said hey
[1:07:35] this road right here is big enough for
[1:07:37] all of us to walk down let's walk down
[1:07:39] it together come on a minute you'll go
[1:07:41] that pathway won't they they need to
[1:07:43] have something say hey no we'll take
[1:07:44] this road or we'll take that road
[1:07:46] but as I was in prayer I could see I
[1:07:48] says but then here come that that's that
[1:07:51] role that only one person can walk down
[1:07:53] at a time
[1:07:54] hey come that road that didn't have the
[1:07:56] street lights it was dark down that road
[1:07:58] that road that looks like spooky coming
[1:08:02] down that road but when everybody else
[1:08:04] took the broad in a lit up path
[1:08:06] everybody else took the easy route and
[1:08:08] the route where everybody can go
[1:08:10] together
[1:08:11] something and you was attracted to that
[1:08:14] straight in that narrow way something
[1:08:16] you was attracted to that to that like
[1:08:19] he says he ordained us to be holy
[1:08:21] something inside you attracted you down
[1:08:23] that Holy Rock wow something you know
[1:08:26] you need to be picked that you knew
[1:08:27] you'd be rejected and laughed at in
[1:08:29] person
[1:08:35] calls you Hallelujah the Deep call to
[1:08:38] the Deep
[1:08:39] something was bidding you come you
[1:08:41] didn't understand it
[1:08:43] but I thank God that the Deep call to
[1:08:47] the deep I thank God that he drew on me
[1:08:50] he chose he pulled me down that road
[1:08:52] people say Ernest where you going we we
[1:08:56] all over here we can walk together God
[1:08:58] called you alone Hallelujah don't he
[1:09:01] individuals come get near to me I want
[1:09:05] to show you who I am look like ain't no
[1:09:07] lights down this path but I'm the light
[1:09:09] of this path come on his word is like a
[1:09:12] laptop feet like to our Pals I'm gonna
[1:09:15] light out the path
[1:09:17] Come On In The Valley in the shadow of
[1:09:19] death you don't have to fear no evil he
[1:09:21] said I'ma be with you you heard him
[1:09:24] calling you you couldn't see him but you
[1:09:26] heard him calling you down that path
[1:09:28] come on I was having a little Revival to
[1:09:30] myself in prayer I said but it's the
[1:09:33] truth though ain't it and I thank God
[1:09:35] because he's still leading you down that
[1:09:37] path ain't he you get down halfway down
[1:09:39] the road you said God we we ain't
[1:09:41] finished yet the journey ain't over yet
[1:09:43] come on God is still safe so you say
[1:09:45] Lord I still need you to hold my hand I
[1:09:48] ain't too grown well I don't need you to
[1:09:49] hold my hand come on I ain't too down
[1:09:51] down the road where I can say Lord I got
[1:09:53] it and I can walk by myself no God hold
[1:09:55] my hand
[1:09:57] keep me in your arms
[1:09:59] Hallelujah don't ever take your hands
[1:10:01] off of me oh because if God did the
[1:10:04] devil to have his way with you but I
[1:10:07] said God keep your arms around
[1:10:09] shout to me keep me in your arms that's
[1:10:12] what I want how many want that tonight
[1:10:14] but I said that that's what it is but
[1:10:16] the raccoon before the before the
[1:10:18] foundation of the world I says that's
[1:10:20] what
[1:10:21] God brought us two but but in seeing
[1:10:24] those things and I had a couple of
[1:10:25] things I wanted to talk about tonight
[1:10:27] but and to go along with that but in
[1:10:29] seeing those things you know I says in
[1:10:32] seeing that that give you confidence you
[1:10:35] know that where we are now no devil in
[1:10:38] hell could have stopped us from getting
[1:10:40] here
[1:10:40] and where are we going no devil in hell
[1:10:43] could stop you from going there
[1:10:45] because that way is ordained by God
[1:10:48] so all we doing is yielding to the image
[1:10:51] that he had of us in his mind all we
[1:10:53] doing is saying Lord here I am make me
[1:10:56] what you saw of me make me that God I
[1:10:59] got uh missions and goals but I I might
[1:11:02] want to be this and that but God I want
[1:11:04] to be what you saw of me whatever you
[1:11:06] what you saw me Lord don't let me fight
[1:11:08] against it because I got to get there
[1:11:10] anyway but just let me yield to what you
[1:11:12] got for me let me yield to what you have
[1:11:14] of me if I got to walk alone that's what
[1:11:16] I want I want to yield to it God help me
[1:11:18] to do that in seeing that because I know
[1:11:21] that that path no devil can't stop you
[1:11:23] from going on that path you know I was
[1:11:25] thinking about I said the image what God
[1:11:27] had in his mind I don't care how much
[1:11:29] the the world had a hold on you and how
[1:11:31] much the lust and things had a hold of
[1:11:33] and grip on you the devil had no other
[1:11:35] choice but when God say it's time to let
[1:11:37] you go he had no other choice but to let
[1:11:39] you go
[1:11:40] because God said it's time now come on I
[1:11:43] saw you coming and Now's the Time
[1:11:45] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] the devil had to say they mine I got him
[1:11:49] I'm accusing him
[1:11:51] but he says I've died to take their
[1:11:53] place the blood and set them free
[1:11:55] Hallelujah he had no other choice but to
[1:11:57] let you go right and that encouraged you
[1:12:00] you could shout the victory you can say
[1:12:01] thank you Lord hallelujah I ain't
[1:12:04] understand all of it but God I'm seeing
[1:12:07] it little by little each and every day
[1:12:09] and I thank God for it that what he's
[1:12:11] saying just start now but it was before
[1:12:13] the like I said the foundation of the
[1:12:15] world he chose us to reveal to reveal
[1:12:18] his uh son in us you know his brother
[1:12:21] Jeremiah comes tonight I says before the
[1:12:24] foundation of the world you know I was
[1:12:26] telling I was telling Moses and I
[1:12:28] thought I'd say this tonight I was
[1:12:29] telling Moses the other day we were uh
[1:12:32] was it maybe at the house I think I was
[1:12:34] riding on the car or something and I was
[1:12:36] telling him I said you know
[1:12:38] the time will come
[1:12:40] I said when uh
[1:12:42] people wish they had been more for God
[1:12:46] I told him I said the time Gonna Come
[1:12:48] where people gonna wish Lord I wish I
[1:12:51] because everything else didn't matter is
[1:12:53] everything else was so important nobody
[1:12:55] had you had you gave God the smallest
[1:12:57] you can give him you gave them the
[1:12:58] littlest that you can give him out your
[1:13:00] life you get them that's all you gave
[1:13:02] them because everything else was taking
[1:13:03] up too much of your time you was too
[1:13:05] busy too much of time too much your
[1:13:07] space but I was telling Moses we're just
[1:13:09] talking I said the time will come with
[1:13:10] many of us wish
[1:13:12] that they could have that they would
[1:13:14] have took out more time
[1:13:15] for God
[1:13:17] that time will come amen's a brother
[1:13:19] Jeremiah
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:41] man I mean you appreciate the word
[1:13:47] that's good to be in the house of the
[1:13:49] Lord and
[1:13:50] more so than that you know I was just
[1:13:52] read his brother Ernest was speaking you
[1:13:55] know and uh as we understanding you know
[1:13:59] the will of God for our lives and the
[1:14:01] things of God that he has given to us
[1:14:04] and seeing I believe we've seen the
[1:14:06] servant of God was saying that Ephesian
[1:14:09] Church Aid they had come to a place that
[1:14:11] they had matured
[1:14:13] and they uh a little more uh
[1:14:16] knowledgeable in the things of God to be
[1:14:18] more settled
[1:14:20] and regard began to deal with of him in
[1:14:23] this Paul
[1:14:24] he was trying to get to the Church of
[1:14:27] the place that we had not just tossed
[1:14:29] about whatever with our Doctrine in me
[1:14:31] we know where we came from and know
[1:14:33] where we're going amen and I know it's
[1:14:36] it's getting clearer and clearer our
[1:14:39] view to each and every one of us now
[1:14:40] that we understand that God had a
[1:14:43] purpose for our lives amen but the
[1:14:46] nothing that we did to deserve it it was
[1:14:48] God grace did that and nothing you can
[1:14:51] do about it you can't stop it amen but
[1:14:54] God will will be done amen amen so we're
[1:14:57] not going to try to prolong the service
[1:14:59] any uh by God's grace so y'all just
[1:15:01] continue to be praying for a pastor and
[1:15:03] those and the services coming up this
