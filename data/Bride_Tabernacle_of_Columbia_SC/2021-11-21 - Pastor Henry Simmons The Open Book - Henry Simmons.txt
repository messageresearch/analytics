amen brother jairus working on our screen we put new projectors up so we have to run new wiring to the new projectors but praise god if you got a phone and you don't have your scriptures you can always some of y'all peep at your phones and if you want to read along or if you got your bibles that's good you bring your bible to church amen it says and also in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals too and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on four and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals are six and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set it upon the throne 8. and they saw a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nations 10. and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands and twelve and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth's and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say blessing and honor and glory and power unto him that set it upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever together and the fourth be said amen and the four and 20 elders fell down to worship him that liveth forever and ever god bless you reward you may be seated amen we thank god for such an hour that we live in as we want to talk about the open book the open book amen so he says amen whose words he amen the song a new song he says in the ninth verse thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof amen it was it was a time when the book was to be opened amen and we want to talk this morning in revelation 10 1 about the open book we find in revelation 5 that the book was sealed amen and no man and nobody was able to take the book amen and john looked and he's someone that was worthy to take the book amen he saw the one that was going to take the book and john was weeping and crying because this book must have meant something it must have was jeer amen and we know that the book today you and i know that the book is the bible amen and we know that it took the opening of the book amen for certain things to happen because when the book is open it identifies amen your victory it identifies amen you in the book amen that's why john was so excited he said you know i say it you know they heard me say blessing and honor amen they heard john john was praising the lord because the book was taken and the book was open amen and it's time that we or amen recognize not only as the book being opened that it positionally placed them into their inheritance amen because they were able to say amen he was able to recognize that you're going to have you're going to reign on the earth amen because once god gave adam dominion over amen the earth this is the book of redemption that means everything amen pray that that you lost god had redeemed he bought it back and putting adam back in his eden and putting you back in eden amen with dominion again amen so the opening of the book amen restore dominion amen restored you back to where adam what adam lost god is giving it back to you that's what the opening of the book is all about amen so the book has been open amen but you have to recognize your position amen because you got to recognize who you are and how you positionally place and when you recognize who you are amen then you can walk in the vision amen you're not walking blind amen but you're walking by faith faith amen that you see what the word is calling you to be in this hour amen i see what god is amen is one amen how i can please god how i can walk in the vision praise god so you know amen what path you take you know where you're going amen you're not just i hear blindly praise god the book has been opened okay revelation 10 1 it says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a clown and a rainbow amen was upon his head amen the mighty ain't j amen and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand or what a little book what amen the open book the little book open amen it's very important that we like recognize that the book has been open amen what book the bible amen had things that would sealed amen and those things that were sealed one day was gonna be opened amen now everybody goes to church and everybody hears about the move but amen but if not many amen that understand amen praise god the book you can go to school and you can learn and you can be a theologian amen let's go to isaiah as we look at revelation 10 maybe i'll get back there isaiah 29 isaiah 29 praise god god is good amen you love him this morning amen when you it it's time to get out of here but how can we go amen if we are not ready to go we got to get ready amen uh proverbs says and all i get and get understanding amen he said my people hosea said my people are destroyed because of lack of what knowledge not only do they like knowledge but they reject knowledge the bible said when jesus came unto his own but his own received them not and and isaiah said who shall believe our reporting to whom is the arm of the lord reveal amen you know if god don't reveal himself to you as an individual than you blind but when god has mercy on you to reveal his word to you amen then you can see who you are wait amen the devil will make you out of anything and everything amen but once amen god revealed to you you're just not somebody just out here just living and doing it you have a purpose god has a plan for your life amen god has a plan for you god knows you god for ordaining you amen to be his sons and daughters are you look man amen because there's a difference amen the rest of the world just live any kind of way because they don't know amen they don't know no better that's why jesus when they were killing him said forgive him amen because they don't know what they're doing so a lot of times you don't look down on the center amen they don't know what they're doing and they're doing all kind of stuff because they don't know what they're doing when they reject god and they're blind they don't know what they're doing but now you got understanding oh you look there but they don't know no better and you getting upset with a sinner because he's a sinner and they don't even know no better you know you ever seen the parent a parent a little child little baby or maybe one or two years old and the parents cursing the child out and just going on at the child and the child just looking and crying and they just started cursing and going on and the child like the child has grown up and understands you know what i'm saying and i and i looked down i said po excuse for a mother amen look what she's doing to that little child amen knowing that this child amen maybe that child might do a little something wrong but it's not worthy of that being cursed out like that and sometimes we uh people they lost it are you a man instead of you know trying to explain to the child and correct the child in a nice and loving way amen and so what happens to the child eventually the child amen is going to do the same thing if they have a child what how their parents treated them they're going to treat their children like that and it's only going to get worse and worse are you up man child being okay uh 29 and 11 isaiah 29 and 11. i i just read the ninth verse it says stay yourself one and cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with what they stagger but not with what for the lord has poured out upon them the spirit of a what how you see people are drunken and god has pulled out upon them the spirit of a deep sleep people are sleeping they not only are they sleeping they have a deep sleep amen the reason why they were drunken look at uh isaiah uh uh 29 and one he said eric eric the city of david that dwell and year to year let them kill sacrifices and in other words god is saying yet i will distress erie and there there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be upon me unto area and i will camp against the roundabout and will lay siege against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee and thou shalt be brought down thou shalt speak out of the ground and what and the voice shall be what and the speech shall and moreover the multitude of thou what and the multitude okay thou shall be visit of the lord of hosts with thunder and with what and great what with the storm and tempest get get your mic kill and the flame to divide the fire are you with me and the multitude of all nations that fight against aryans and all that fight against her [Music] and [Music] what and what shall what and i shall even what that that's all right that's good that's good what i want to get to is the people of israel and ephraim amen they had rebelled against god and god they weren't listening to god so god had no other choice amen but to pull upon them those those that weren't listening to the prophets wasn't listening to the word god pulled upon them a deep sleep oh you look man because they wasn't listening god gave them a space and sent them prophets and sent them the word but they wasn't listening to the word no more so god give them the spirit like a drunk man a deep sleep you know uh y'all ever seen somebody that got so drunk and then they just fall out and you try to wake them up you you it's hard to wake up when they're in that deep sleep and been drunken are you with me let's go back to um where we were they were he says but with one and then the ninth verse he says they're drunk but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drinks amen for the lord has poured out upon them the spirit of a deep sleep and has what close their eyes their prophets and your work and your seals has what has it covered god is covered and that's what happens we see the church world amen as a as a whole amen and i said you know what we trying to get bigger churches more members amen bigger buildings we're trying to get this and that and that's the lord just what is man caught up in is they concerned about the soul of people or how much they can do and look good amen and sometimes people are building hospitals they're building soup kitchens they're building this and that and they just you know it's more of an economic well what about the soul of man the bible says seek you first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will i what i'm i'm saying god is going to take care of all those other things if you seek god first amen i never seen the righteous forsaken us what but look look what man is i mean they'll achieve and accomplish amen the church would be rich increasing goods that i have needed nothing we see people are just expanding they're working hard man they just going wow amen and and then churches are growing like what multitudes they even turn them into a nightclub you go in they got the lights going and somebody said he even got the smoke going in the church amen and the people the young people are really getting in there and dancing they're getting in the groove at church and it's strange that people don't know no battle because why god said i'll pour out upon them the spirit of a deep sleep the people are sleep and they're drunk but not with wine are you with me so what what is happening thank god for his grace and his mercy upon our lives because people are drunk but not with the mind go ahead caleb the tempers for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of a deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets in your root in your rulers the seer hath he covered and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed as a book that is sealed i'm going to tell you something sometimes folk can sit in the church and the word come as a book that's sealed sometimes people are sat right here in the midst of the church and the word it's like a book that's been sealed why but go ahead which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he said i cannot for it is sealed and and i'm going to tell you something when it's sealed you can't read something that's sealed somebody you got to open up that letter or whatever if you want to read it because it's sealed and the bible has been a sealed book are you with me but at the end the seal book is supposed to be an open book amen go ahead the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he says i am not learned therefore the lord said for as much as those people draw near me for with their mouth look look isn't that the same thing happening today the people draw near me with their mouths and what and with their lips do honor me you see them and you can't holly go in the stone they say god bless you god bless you and you can see those same people before you know it they're cursing somebody out and they're saying god bless you that's good you know but their hearts are far from me their lives i mean they it's just a a saying that they say it's just something you can't convince folks now that you know you need to be saved because they they think that i can be saved and cursed and raise sand and live any kind of way and still save from what our folks are saved from what what are they saved from i mean the preachers the preachers and the prophets they got the people so blind to the people of thinking that they're going to heaven and and all of this just you know they're just thinking everything's going to be all right okay go ahead caleb but have to remove their heart far from me you see what i'm saying they removed their hearts far from me israel was in bad shape and i'm saying the church is in bad shape today they removed their hearts far from me you know god is saying to where's your heart is your heart in it do you really love god do you really care about your soul are you really concerned about your soul go ahead and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men you know it's taught by the precepts of men go ahead therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvelous work among these people even a marvelous work in the wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord see you can't hide your sins and your counsel from the lord you can't hide from the lord don't try to don't don't oh lord go ahead and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay for shall the works say of him that made it he had he made me not or shall the thing frame say of him that framed it he have no understanding you know i'ma tell you something when you're drunk and you're saying that god you don't have no understanding he it is he that has made us and not we ourselves but you're telling god you know you have no understanding god understands amen and you just can't do anything and you know i'm gonna tell you we can run you know the funeral after funeral and everybody want to go to heaven everybody want to put their loved ones i can't see them over there they're going to heaven you know everybody's going to heaven everybody no matter how how they live you know it used to be the preachers were saying as the tree fall that's the way it's going to lie are you with me if you're dying to sin the bible said the wages of sin is what death you can't put a person in heaven when they you know they made the decision why they were living are you with me and i'm gonna tell you brothers and sisters it's time that we we come to grips with ourselves i got to go back to uh i was back in revelation but i'm gonna skip some stuff i'm gonna go to uh luke 4 and 16. i'm talking about the open book amen i'm going to tell you something until the book is open to you amen you can read the bible every day and you can get up and do your religious duties but the book has to be open to you are you with me and you can preach it you can sing it you can do all of those good things but until you understand what part of the book amen god is requiring of you this day you got to know what scriptures that pertain into your life and what god is requiring what god is expecting of you as individuals are you with me and each and every one of us as lively stones amen has the purpose and ordained purpose of god for our lives and nobody can fulfill the stone amen because god has want to mold you and make you it meant through his hand amen allows certain trials and tribulations and things to happen in your life that is the molding of god amen god is more than character that you might fit into his temple amen so you are lively stones amen and god has to allow certain types of heat to heat up the stone and certain types of things that happen to you in your life to mold you and make you the potter you're in the potter's hand and god is trying to mold you amen and sometimes we we we don't want the part of hand to be upon us and we want to do our own thing amen but the part of amen he has the power of the over the clay to make one vessel on and one to this side you got to just it realized that amen god i'm in your hand if i yield to you then you're going to mold me and make me what i need to be and what i should be amen but see sometimes we amen trying to amen choose our own path and try to lead ourselves amen we try to act like goat instead of sheep amen a sheep amen you're in the hand of god and god is mold and you making you what he wants you to be not what you want to be but what god wants you to be now i'm talking about an open book the open book amen luke um 4 and 16. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for it to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book when he had what opened the what he opened the book see jesus opened the book are you with me jesus hanted in revelation 5 amen nobody the lion of the tribe of judah he has revealed prevailed to what take the book and then loosen the seven seals amen jesus the lamb of god has prevailed to take the book are you with me as he took the book then and he took the book here he takes the book now for you and i am no man can come to the me except my father draw him isn't that right and no man can come to me amen lord you've not chosen me but i chose you praise god amen don't you know you've written epistles written and read of all men it takes jesus christ to open the book of your life praise god god amen began to reveal to you out of the book who you are you're not meant to be what you thought you were they meant you're not meant to go down to the path that they meant that other people go down i chose you out of the world i chose you for a different purpose praise god you have something that god sees in you that you can't see in yourself but the book is open amen i'm going to tell you something when god began to deal with you amen he began to explain to you your purpose for life amen he gives gives you direction gives you guidance give your leadership that's what god wants to do for you amen nobody can do that but jesus nobody could loose the seals with jesus nobody can open up your ordained purpose with jesus nobody can save you but jesus nobody redeems you but jesus are you with me so he took the book and he opened amen he positionally placed the season and the time the hour that they were living in amen and until that time they met everybody just didn't know where they were but when jesus took the book and he opened the book of the old testament amen that was sealed amen up and they were ignorant to the fact amen of those things that were written in the book but isaac had false said who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he should grow up as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground are you with me god was coming to fulfill what isaiah 53 said about him but they were blind to that amen they were drunk and they were filled with wine he meant of their pharisees religion and of their sadducee religion they were so denominational-minded they met and they were so blind in their religion in their religion and in their theology that they were so drunk in that and they were so overwhelmed and amen sometimes the church can blind you amen praise god and when god is moving outside of the church because they don't want jesus in the church they amen they want to do their own thing they're more interested in uh the building that their they got amen but even jesus disciples said lord it took 46 years to build this temple he said destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up again i'm trying to get you on the spiritual revelation the temple that i'm interested in it's not this 46 year old temple that they built i'm not interested in solomon temple because the greater than solomon is here i want you to know that your body is the temple of the holy ghost i want to dwell in you i want to make you my house and my house shall be called the house of prayer amen god has an ordained purpose are you up man god is taking us places i'm talking about when he opened the book there's something about god opening the book there's something like god open in your eyes it's something about god revealing the book oh hallelujah no more than i'm coming to church because mama said come no more than i'm coming to church because that's the thing the family does but i'm coming to church amen because amen i'm in the book and i see what's written of me amen i see amen my name in the book i see what god is all about amen i see amen what's worth living for amen i see my purpose amen i see where i'm going amen hey man if you can't see it then the book is not open to you it's still sealed go ahead back luke he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord now you if you notice in isaiah it said here at the separate year of the lord if you put your hand on isaiah 6 61 hold that there and go to isaiah 61 and see how he broke the scripture in half are you with me and the prophet of god talked about this day this scripture is fulfilling your ears amen so i want you to hold your hand there and go to isaiah 61. and i want you to read the second verse he said go go read the first verse the spirit of the lord is is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bond up to broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives in the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim this acceptable year of the lord okay they accept the year of the lord and then he says what in the day of vengeance of our god see he broke the scripture in half because he wasn't fulfilling the last part that's our day the day of vengeance of our god amen that's when the judgment hits but he he was doing the acceptable year of the lord and you see what i'm saying see the opening of the book the opening of the seals revealed to us what's going on it meant because it is is god that technical yes he's technical amen because this is god that's moving amen and if you look at the book you think amen uh that he talked about the whole thing but no he says an acceptable year of the lord this is amen when he comes to die not when he comes to judge are you with me but it's going to be a time when it's going to be the day of vengeance judgment is going to strike and the day of vengeance of our god our lord is coming back even him that pierce him don't see him every eye gonna sin but when he comes back for the rapture ever i don't see him amen praise god him that pierced him won't see him but he comes at the thief in the night and he comes to take his bride out of here isn't that right in the rapture amen praise god are y'all with me amen so uh when they said evie i don't see him amen now even him that pierced him don't see him amen that's the day of vengeance amen god's going to come back and it's going to be the last battle the final battle but i want you to be ready to get out of here because i want you to understand if the book had not been opened we wouldn't have understood what was going on right here amen the jews even though he read the acceptable year they still didn't understand even his disciples didn't fully understand that he was talking about the acceptable yield they still thought he'd come to restore the kingdom to israel they still thought he was they met the king and come to set on the throne of david they still was uh amen but god amen knowing amen that he he identified himself in scripture and what he was doing amen but they still missed it amen god can identify i'm talking about if his disciples his apostles that he chose and if they could miss it what about you and i praise god you don't miss your day of visitation don't miss your hour with the time that you're living in because it's a glorious time if you can only see it it don't mean nothing to the unbeliever the churchgoer the religious person the why don't mean a thing to them but to you and i it's a glorious season it's a glorious time why because god is opening the word the book to you and uh amen but people the ones that's in a deep sleep i'm tired i already go home this world is lit uh but if the preacher's saying um [Music] they woke up when somebody played well on this music instrument and somebody that's going to really articulate and go around and you know train voices and trained preachers amen praise god it's all right if the holy ghost is doing it but we don't want to put on no show and make you feel good and you don't know where you're at what hour you're hearing it's all right it's all right to groan and moan sometimes that's all right but i want you to know where you're at and know how you're living and know what god is requiring in your day if you miss that then all that groaning and moaning ain't gonna mean a thing no matter how good you felt but what you needed you missed oh i feel so much better that's just for a season but when judgment began to strike amen where you're going to be brother and sister now he's back in on luke 4 he says he said the preacher accepted the year of the of the lord amen now let's go to luke 24 excuse me i might come to close the earth early amen luke 24 and 44. jesus had risen from the dead and everything and he was on the road to emmaus and they said did not our hearts burn within us as you speak with us along the way amen jesus had to tell them because they were sorrowful and their hearts was broken because jesus had just been crucified and and they had just killed the lord but he had risen from the dead and and and they was on the road to emmaus means in sorrow and and god jesus began to rebuke him because amen they were you know it's so sorrowful and they were troubled amen he said jesus said why are you so you're troubled and why do the thoughts of your heart behold my hand and my feeding it is i myself my uh handle me and see for spirit has not flesh and bone as ye see that i have amen and when he had just spoken he showed them his hand and his feet and while they were yet believed not for joy and wonder he said unto them have ye any meat amen jesus was dealing with them amen i'm gonna say jesus he's dealing with our hearts trying to get our attention trying to get us focused in trying to get you to understand look how i dealt with my disciples look what all i've done for look at all the experience yet they were still still in doubt still wandering and amazed you know just how i've been in jesus day how far god would go just to reach out to you just how far would it go he won't let you go straight look how far he reaches out his hand look how far he's i'm not gonna let you go look how we do sometimes but god reaches well done amen when he reached down his hand for me i was wretched and undone without god as son but when he reached down his hand for me oh god thank you for reaching down and get me praise god i could have been religious i could have been just as blind as the pharisee i could have been like messiah you see i could have went through the motions and went to the church thinking i'm all right i could have been like saul of tasha's i could have been another paul but god had mercy on me are you a man praise god i could have not cared about my day i could have not cared about this jesus who's called christ but one day god opened my heart one day to let me know it's real amen it's all right i don't oh i'm not worried about muhammad i'm not worried about buddha i'm not worried about hinduism but i'm talking about a jesus to save me one day praise god that changes my life give me something worth living for i'm talking about a god that's alive i'm talking about a god that lives i'm talking about a god that heals a oh i'm talking about a god that's real talking about a god that's real praise god we're not serving a dead god i don't care how dead he is to you he's not dead in my life i don't care what you feel about it what you think about it i know my god is real praise god i know amen praise god i'm going to take nothing for my journey amen i don't care what you can't give me nothing amen there ain't nothing better than jesus his word it means so much to me praise god i want jesus this bible means everything to me amen i won't i won't trade it for nothing praise god i will trade the word of god for nothing praise god you might as well forget it i don't even want to hear it i'm not changing those i won't change this or receive nothing better than the word of god but there's nothing better to me than the word of god this bible means everything this book amen and it's better it's even better because not only is it the word of god but it's an open book now it's getting gooder it's getting better and better amen i think my word is good it's better are you aren't you glad for the book aren't you glad that it's been open okay so caleb you still got me i know you want to play a little bit but let's let's go i didn't forget luke 24 44 okay amen i'm trying to come home y'all y'all helped me come home trying to get there i got so much but i can't get it get you can't give it all you know the old bishop said you can't tell it all night you're going too long he said you can't tell it all tonight [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] and he said unto them these are the words which i speak unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me now now see what it's very important that he opened the book then what then hopefully he their understanding see accept your understanding be open see what i'm saying now the book was here all the time but they did not understand the scriptures amen it's in all that getting get understanding you know why people amen are setting the denomination and has the husband uh the denominational husband some people are married to baptist some people are married to a methodist some people are married to all these husbands out here you know it's different names amen people are actually married and while that first husband live it amen praise god until that first husband died amen then they're free they're not under bondage anymore to the law of the creeds and dogmas but they are free to marry jesus christ who is the word amen but as long as that first husband lived amen they are bound by the law to that husband are you with me as long as the you're under the law amen then amen you're not under grace praise god and god has to let the grace of christ come and grace has come to you but if you under the law you're still in bondage because there was no law that could give you life but jesus christ come by the grace of god that you might have eternal life praise god the law made you recognize that you were sinner but it gave you no way out are you with me but jesus christ amen praise god fulfill amen the law praise god and he amen died and was crucified he meant the justice of the law was required and he met that justice so he died for our sins and fulfilled the law praise god that you amen might have life and light more abundantly he crucified and died for you that you might become the righteousness of god in him god did it for you thank god that jesus did it for me hallelujah i'm so glad he did it he did it for me he died for me praise god i'm no longer in bondage thank god i'm free amen are you free this morning amen you're no longer in bondage praise god to man creeds or dogmas they meant some denominational thought our idea they made your freedom marry jesus christ and you know he is the word praise god hallelujah no creeds no dogmas but the word of god praise god man not oh go ahead on i got the clothes that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus is the who christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name who what name is that his name what name it's in red and y'all bible is to be preaching his name whose name repentance and remission of sin that's why peter said on the day of pentecost repent and what we baptize every one of you in the name of what jesus christ for what the remission of sin and you share what are you with me you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now if you don't do it that's up to you amen but that's what the bible says but the book has to be opened amen some people still don't want the book to be open they want the book to be sealed and they say well i baptize you in the name of the father and the son and of the holy ghost no you got to be baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost and that name is jesus amen he's the lord jesus christ amen praise god he's father in the beginning son of redemption holy ghost in the church today but his name is jesus and neither is salvation in any other for there is none other name given among men under heaven whereby we must be saved at the name of jesus they have a knee shave and every tongue should confess that he's the lord isn't that right the bible said whatsoever you do in words of deed do it all in the name of what jesus amen oh you got to do it in jesus name if you're going to do anything do it in my name if you ask anything of my father accident my name in the name of jesus you know what name to call when you get baptized to
