word would find oh God a place resting place in our hearts Lord God that would touch the sick and Afflicted Lord and oh God restore the backslider cause us oh God Lord God to draw closer to you Lord that's what we want Lord that's what we need Lord may you bless now in Jesus Christ name we thank you amen the book of 2 Corinthians 5 I'm just reading a lot concerning the theophany and where we leave here and we have a body a theopen body and this life here is full of talls said in this world you're going to have tribulation but he said be of good cheer because I've overcome the world so here in 2 Corinthians 5 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were desire we have a building of God and house not made with hand Eternal in heaven God bless you toward you may be seated house not made with hand amen it was telling me some of the fellows they was telling me that he said three three of our classmates died this week uh within them L I said well you know when it gets around our age people just go go go go go after while just will be a few left amen so life is short a house not made with hand that's what he Paul here says and we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle where Des are we have a building of God and house not made with hands etern in Heavens and the prophet of God you know he told us about going beyond the curtain of time and how he saw that nobody could get there except you got perfect love and he saw the people everybody was young and they came up and greeting him and says my precious brother and um he said the women had on long dresses down to the ankle and everybody was barefooted and so forth and so but by the grace of God you know sometimes you know God shows us things and in our desire we ought the desire to be like Jesus with all our hearts that's what we were saying in His image and his likeness on Sunday in His image and in his likeness that's what God wants us because when Adam and Eve Sinn Man became like a beast like a so the nature of Man became corrupt so the Bible says we needed to be born again not of corruptible seed but Incorruptible seed by the word of God we should live it and abide forever so this corruption he talks about a house not made with hand and in um 1 Corinthians 15 a house not made with hand God got something waiting on you and I and um the prophet of God talks about we leave here we go into our theophan body and theophany body and then he says the theop body comes back to pick up the redeemed body in the air and then we change but he says here a lot of times he says the god God made us and uh humans and I made us uh men and women not angels and you know that aboard where the Angels were but God put us here on the earth in this Dimension and he didn't make us Angels made us Sons and Daughters of God are you with me so God made us Sons and Daughters of God but we know that when the saint of God die he said there'll be no marriage and giving in marriage but we'll be like an angels in other words there will be no sexual desire there be no fleshly thing like that are you with me so by the grace of God to this body here that came forth in sin it's groaning it's painting it's striving we strive if we're from above we strive to be like him something in US yearn to be perfect because that's the way God made us so that part of us that genan seed it's a j because we were a part of God's thinking in the beginning and being that way it's a yearning is groaning we desire to go back to be that which God wanted us to be before the foundation of the world but he knew sin would come in but God had a plan to bring us back that's why the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world the purpose of Jesus being slain in the mind of God you know is because he was slain for you and I so uh 1 Corinthians 15 a house not made with hand he says in the 50th verse now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God I'm going to tell you something we can hold on to all this Flesh and Blood stuff I mean all these Affair it can't enter the kingdom of God that's my brother that's my sister that's my cousin that my family no no no no no we it's only one family and that's the family of God I know you love your loved ones and love your fames nothing against that but I'm going tell you something you can stick so close to that and God will give you what your heart desire when but when a man must forsake father mother sister brother you got to forsake it all to come to Jesus and sometime we think it's all right but sometimes when it comes down to serving God and worshiping God you can't look at I'm taking up from my my brother I'm taking up for my sister I mean this is flesh flesh and blood Affair flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God and your flesh the only way you you you got to have confidence in this flesh that this flesh it must mean something to you but flesh and blood cannot inherit a king in my father's house he says a many mansion in my father's Kingdom of many pal he said the prophet of God said I I I I knew that God was going away he said it's not going to be stones and Bricks he said uh it it's a body that God has prepared for us so God has prepared uh a a a a temple he said destroy this Temple that's made with hand and I raise it up up in three days he was talking about his body are you with me so this Temple that took 46 years was made with hand but destroyed this Temple and I'll raise it up the third day in three days I'll raise it up again so this is this is body this the thing that gets us all mixed up but our affection ought to be on things above but we have all our problems because uh uh the the devil wants to have you and I Conor minded but he said be spiritual minded because nothing in this world matters because you and I are p and strangers we come from God we're going back to God we just spiritual and strangers moving through this land this is not our home this is the prophet of God said this is only a reflection it's a reflection this is not the real you this is a shadow this is just a a temporary thing are you with me but God has a body not made with hand he has a he he he has a spiritual body that would not get sick you don't have to worry about getting old and grhe headed and wrinkled or whatever don't have to worry about pain and sickness why because the God gives you a body not made with hand so I want you to anticipate that and none of this stuff that this de the devil try to get you mixed up tangled up messed up in it ain't even worth it are you with me so get you know your mind Lord I want to please you with all of my heart I want to live for you I want to please you I realize that I got a short time here to be tested and tried and tempted but I know amen it nothing in this world Amen matters because I have a a new Heaven A New World I think God servant say a new world that God a new Heaven A New Earth God got something new amen one that faded not away praise God this would fade away but God got a body that does not fade away are you with me so you don't have to hold on to this thing here this thing here will deceive you amen you'll be looking at the flesh amen and you'll be mining the Flesh and this thing going to Decay even what we possess what uh uh uh money wealth all of that is it it'll corrode fire can burn it the bombs can blow it up a hurricane can sweep it away are you with me but we have one that amen that's why you know when he talks about the house that's built upon a rock and you must be built upon a revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ you must have a revelation of who you are your house is built upon a rock are you with me he said Upon This Rock upon this Revelation I build my church amen you must know who you are he said now we are the what you are Sons and Daughters of God are you with me but you got to realize the god part of you amen yet you battling with this flesh there's a walk constantly going on this flesh wants to have preeminence but God gives you the holy ghost that the flesh might not have dominion over you that's why is very important that we have the baptism of the Holy ghost because it'll keep the devil in subjection it keep the devil under your feet this flesh will not rule you anymore you know I thought about who's living in your house who lives there what kind of spirit resides in you the man said um when Jesus came he said don't come in Tor minut us before the time if you cast us out cast us into the swine who he said Jesus said what's your name he said my name is Legions because we what cuz we're many but who's dwelling in your house he cast Seven Devils out of Mary magaline how many devils are in you if go if if Jesus pass your way how many Devils will he have to cast out you see so who's in your house is is your body the Temple of the Holy Ghost is God is is it God dwelling place is the tent of the house that you have a house not made with hand amen this is what I'm saying to you amen recognize that it must be a present it must be a person that dwells inside of you and that's the person of Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost amen he must dwell in ins side of your temple and you must you must welcome his presence and amen anything contrary to the word of God Amen it Grieves the very spirit that dwells inside of you and when the spirit is grieved then repentance is immediately amen reacted it comes to conviction and repentance I must repent because I not pleased God and I my body body belongs to him everything I got belong to him so it's a quick we quickly repent because we don't want to be out the will of God we don't want to be out of God's presence he said cast me not away from thy presence amen and renew a right Spirit Within Me amen I don't I I want his presence to be here you you notice when Cain Ked this brother he went out from the presence of God and some folk amen they don't mind leaving the presence of God I'm not talking about leaving the church but I'm talking about leaving the presence because some people are sat here in the church but they're not in his presence because sin would separate you from him amen but he said in my father's house we want to know that who's dwelling there is this the father's house amen is this God house is this God's Temple amen who's dwelling there it's God here okay flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does Co corruption inherit incorruption amen the seed is Incorruptible seed behold I show you mystery we should not all what sleep when we can't die the Bible said we pass from Death to life so we whosoever believ in me should never never what die that's why he said to his disciples our friend laders asleep and I'm going to awake him and they said if he sleep Lord he do it he do it well he's all right cuz he's sleeping I'm going to tell you brother and sisters amen death does not scare you you're not afraid to die because amen the Jesus died to to take that fear or dying away from you amen so what happens amen yet we don't want to die because amen it's something inside of us all uh uh human beings we want to live because life is important are you with me but yet when it comes down to Dy he said fear not little flock for it's your father good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so you don't have to worry about dying you just go to sleep when that time come amen when God calls your number amen and calls your name he said you know one day he'll call and Joel said I will answer and when he calls me you can answer say God Amen when I hear your voice I want to say I want to hear you say well done praise God I was just reading for my Bible Lesson the other morning and he said he said he said they they G to come he said I I never knew you your work was of iniquity then he going to say Well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joy now you don't want him to say I never knew you your workers of iy are you with me but you want to hear him say Well done see it it's something about when you when you when this life is over you don't know when you're going to go brother Nathan said a young man got killed they said a young lady but you know young man got killed out there the other day 20 years old you know you don't know when you're going here brother Ernest was praying for the family amen but sometimes you don't know what when your time is going to come but one thing about it you have a promise and brother and sister you got to live like you believe amen that amen the house that I got a house you know you save your money and you save this for your car you save your money money for your house and you you work hard and labor for it but in your spirit amen that spiritual house mean more than that natural house that spiritual amen the the the the the things amen you know think about Elijah when when Elijah got through with his ministry God sent a a a chariot of fire to come down and and say swing L che sweet charot and let me ride and Elijah was able to step on a fiery Chariot and go on to heaven are you talking about a car automobile a plane wouldn't you like a ride amen when he can send a chariot for you amen and you can step in and go on the glory get you know not worried about all the the pollution and all the filth and all of this that's going on in this world but you can go home amen sobody grace of God let me just go back here he says behold I show you a mystery we should not all sleep but we shall be what changed and I says from In His Image and in his likeness amen God is bringing us back to where Adam and Eve fell from Back To His Image back to his likeness never to fall again are you with me you know that's why I read the Jew you never fall not to him that's able to keep you from falling and to presentent you faultless before his presence with exceeding Joy I'm talking about Joy see I'm I'm going to tell you something if you know amen that you getting ready to be blessed abundant amen and you know that your blessing is on the way amen you better stay in line and wait for that blessing somebody somebody says well you know what I'm I'm going to do when you graduate from high school I'mma buy you a brand new car you know you you you might want to quit you might want to teacher might talk about you whatever but when you graduate from high school I'm going buy you a brand new car it doesn't matter what other young people do they can go do bad stuff and they can do that but you want to get your graduation when you get your new car but I'm talking about a new body a new body that you don't have to hurt anymore you don't have to worry no more you don't have to think about I'm talking about this is what God Said when you get through with this the tests and trials of this life I got a house not made it in I got something prepared for you I'm I'mma bless you abundantly I got something for you amen I know something sometimes it's difficult I know sometimes you don't understand what you're going through but nevertheless if you just hold on a little while just wait a little while and I want to bless you it says we're going to be changed praise God job I mean the song said all the days of my appointed time oh job said will I wait to my what change we're going to really experience for job said I know that my redeemer live amen I know amen that amen the Redeemer has redeemed me he has paid the price and even before Jesus came on the earth of joob was able to say amen I know my redeemer live even more so you and I ought to say I know that my redeemer live and what was it amen everything that Adam lost God has brought it back to us through Jesus Christ the Redeemer has redeemed you and I so we're children let the redeem of the Lord say so yes amen we can say Amen I've been redeemed I've been washed in the blood amen praise God Redemption means something to me amen I mean amen Lord thank you for redeeming me thank you for bu paying the price and bringing me back Amen in Fellowship amen that I can talk to God I can live for God and I can tell him how much I appreciate him that I love him praise God thank you Lord if job could go through the things he went through because he knew his redeemer live brother and sisters these little trials and tests that we have to go through amen just amen know that your redeemer live for amen a house not made with hand I don't care how beautiful amen a $10 million doll house some of these ball players and all they got amen they got uh 50,000 ft of houses and swimming pools and a basketball rack and everything oh Lord but I ain't worried about that it's no comparison because they can get sick and they can die and their soul can be lost but one thing about it even that Hallelujah oh Hallelujah they can never try on the roove of righteousness that God gives you praise God when you amen folk can amen they can walk out and they can uh look like uh you know some super uh man or something like that Super Woman but one thing about it amen the body that God has prepared for you the prophet said beyond the curtains of time they walked out and they had white robes on down to the ankle amen I'm talking about walking out amen because the white robes represent the righteousness of the Saints Amen brother and sister I'm saying put on Amen his righteousness he became sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so brother and sister it's not something that the prophet said it it ain't something that you trying to do you trying to you know live the life you trying he he said the faith that God gives us is not your faith it's his faith amen so it's his faith that he's given to us and and I'm I'm saying brother and sister you don't have to try to live right God gives you his grace he gives you his grace amen he gives you his strength amen not your strength but my strength my strength is made in weakness when I

order to make you he got to break you praise God because sometimes we don't want to be broken but God wants to make you amen amen the clay got to be molded and made over again praise God I got to take this vessel that ain't no good and I I got to break it amen and it's got to be molded into the image that God want me to be Hallelujah in My Father's House amen not not the image that I want to be I don't want to look like what I want to be I want to say God let your will be done amen I want to glorify you when when people see me I want them to see a a son a daughter of God I wanted to see the glory of God I wanted to see that there's a God that's real there's a God that's living inside of me I want to see God living amen I want to see the life of Jesus Christ amen oh Hallelujah that's what
