[48:59] I'm not looking at something that uh
[49:03] that I I
[49:04] can't
[49:06] comprehend but I'm looking at something
[49:09] that God has laid before us so that we
[49:12] could
[49:13] see and understand what the finished
[49:16] product is going to
[49:18] be as we stand let us turn to the
[49:23] scripture amen according to
[49:30] First
[49:32] Corinthians we're going to start reading
[49:34] there at
[49:35] the 15th chapter starting at the ninth
[49:40] verse we'll read down to the
[49:46] 10th give honor to our Lord and Savior
[49:49] Jesus Christ we thank God for our pastor
[49:53] and brother amen Henry Simmons thank God
[49:56] for you
[49:58] all
[50:00] uh having me I actually came
[50:04] to encourage and support our brother
[50:09] Robert Sumpter in his time of
[50:11] bement uh but in so doing God has
[50:15] allowed me to minister as
[50:18] well I counted a privilege and an honor
[50:20] to do
[50:22] so um and I trust that somehow God
[50:26] blesses us tonight in a special way 1
[50:29] Corinthians 15 beginning at the 9th
[50:31] verse for I am the least of the
[50:35] Apostles that am not meat to be called
[50:38] an
[50:40] apostle because I persecuted the Church
[50:43] of
[50:44] God this is the part I like but by the
[50:48] grace of God I am what I
[50:53] am and his grace which was bestowed
[50:56] rested upon me was not in
[50:59] vain but I labored more abundantly than
[51:03] they
[51:04] all yet not
[51:07] I but the grace of God which was with me
[51:13] he
[51:14] labored because of the grace of God that
[51:18] was with
[51:19] him 2
[51:22] Corinthians the 11th
[51:25] chapter the 23rd verse there we'll start
[51:29] reading and we'll read down to the
[51:36] 30th are they Ministers of
[51:39] Christ I speak as a
[51:42] fool I am
[51:45] more in labors more
[51:48] abundant in Stripes above measure in
[51:53] prison more frequent in deaths of of the
[51:59] Jews five times received thy 40 Stripes
[52:03] save one twice was I beaten with rods
[52:08] once I was stoned twice I suffered
[52:11] shipwreck a night and a day have I spent
[52:15] in the deep in Journeys often in Perils
[52:18] of waters and Perils of robbers in
[52:22] perils by mine own countrymen in perils
[52:26] by the Heathen imp perils in the cities
[52:29] imp perils in the wilderness imp Perils
[52:32] of the sea imp perils among false
[52:36] brethren in weariness and painfulness
[52:40] and watching often in hunger and thirst
[52:44] in fasting often in cold and
[52:47] nakedness besides those things that are
[52:50] without Hallelujah that which cometh
[52:53] upon me daily the care of all all the
[52:57] churches who is
[52:59] weak and am I not weak who is
[53:04] often offended excuse me who is offended
[53:07] and I burn not if I must need Glory I
[53:12] reg glory of the things which
[53:14] concern my
[53:17] infirmities let us
[53:20] pray Heavenly
[53:23] Father we thank you for your grace
[53:27] and your
[53:30] mercy thank you for
[53:33] being The God Who You
[53:38] Are We Love You Lord not for the
[53:42] materialistic things that you've given
[53:45] us but we love you the most because of
[53:49] the
[53:50] revelation of
[53:52] yourself that you have placed in our
[53:55] hearts
[53:56] something that no man can take away from
[54:01] us no trial no tribulation no Peril
[54:06] nothing can separate us from the love of
[54:09] God which is in Christ Jesus and on
[54:13] tonight I pray Lord that you bless this
[54:16] service in a special way in Jesus
[54:20] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[54:23] seated
[54:36] I'd like to entitle this
[54:39] message
[54:42] focusing on his
[54:46] will and I want to really
[54:50] emphasize that God will is perfect
[54:58] I don't know how we all feel
[55:02] tonight but as the word of the
[55:07] hour and I'm not talking about the flesh
[55:09] part of
[55:10] me I'm talking about the regene
[55:13] part I
[55:15] am and so are
[55:18] you we are the word of the
[55:22] hour and So speaking in that way it may
[55:27] even sound
[55:29] Blasphemous but I want to say that God
[55:32] did not
[55:34] stop there at a revealing of a
[55:39] prophet but I want to say this in in all
[55:43] that has been
[55:45] revealed my highest
[55:48] ambition in this life is only to see
[55:52] Jesus Christ glorified
[55:57] I live for that now that sounds like my
[56:01] words but those are the prophet's
[56:04] words but I want to say that if I should
[56:08] live a million
[56:11] years I had that much life to live I
[56:14] want to live
[56:16] every minute of it for him now you
[56:22] talking about A Love Affair these are
[56:25] not words that just going to provoke
[56:28] your curiosity but these are words of
[56:30] confession something that is coming from
[56:33] someone's
[56:35] heart and if I knew I be turned down at
[56:39] the end it is such a privilege to live
[56:44] for
[56:45] him why because he is so
[56:51] real and I have personally have found
[56:55] never found
[56:57] nothing in all of my traveling travels
[57:01] of life that would anyway
[57:04] compare with the fellowship that I
[57:07] have together with him alone can I can I
[57:11] get a
[57:12] witness I love
[57:14] church I love
[57:17] singing I love fellowshipping with my
[57:20] brothers and my sisters but when I get
[57:22] down to pray
[57:28] and the
[57:30] fellowship that I receive when I'm in
[57:33] prayer cannot
[57:36] compare in my prayer he's
[57:39] real he's not a figment of my
[57:42] imagination he talks with me he walks
[57:47] with me and he tells me I am his
[57:53] own thinking about Sister Mary when you
[57:56] come down to the end of your
[57:59] journey you got to know
[58:02] him and most of all he's got to know
[58:07] you thinking about
[58:10] Paul we looking at a time where the
[58:14] Corona virus have shut everything
[58:17] down
[58:19] practically the only thing that this
[58:21] Corona cannot shut down is the Bride of
[58:25] Jesus Christ
[58:28] you see we don't need a building though
[58:30] God has given us
[58:33] one somebody help me
[58:36] here because we have a revelation that
[58:39] we are the temple of
[58:43] God when I want joy I have joy if I need
[58:48] peace I have
[58:50] peace all things that I need I find in
[58:55] him amen
[58:57] Hallelujah
[58:58] somebody Paul who was a great man of God
[59:02] and I trust that I won't be long but he
[59:04] was a great man of God but Paul said I'm
[59:08] the least of
[59:10] them why Paul because I was one who
[59:14] persecuted the church I stood there and
[59:17] I cheered for them to to to to strike
[59:20] Steven
[59:22] down but by the grace of God
[59:27] I am what I am Paul was saying I can't
[59:31] change anything I can't change my past I
[59:34] can't change my future all I know is I
[59:37] am what I
[59:39] am and the grace of God is with me
[59:44] Hallelujah God could have left us blind
[59:47] as far as I'm concerned this message is
[59:49] the greatest thing that ever struck the
[59:52] Earth bear with me just a moment
[59:56] Paul says I was in the will of
[1:00:00] God when I was laboring abundantly I was
[1:00:02] in the will of
[1:00:04] God when I was beaten by rods I was in
[1:00:07] the will of God when they C when they
[1:00:10] when they when they killed me brought
[1:00:12] brought me to death I was in the will of
[1:00:15] God Paul said every one of my
[1:00:18] infirmities I will glory in why because
[1:00:22] I realized I was in the will of God
[1:00:27] see often time when we go through
[1:00:29] hardships and trials and tests we feel
[1:00:31] like oh somewhere I'm out of the will of
[1:00:34] God but not necessarily
[1:00:36] so the footsteps of a righteous man are
[1:00:38] ordered by God hallelujah and when you
[1:00:42] have amen by God's grace when you have a
[1:00:45] relationship with him you don't wonder
[1:00:48] where you
[1:00:49] are cuz you know he's leading
[1:00:51] you even if people don't understand even
[1:00:55] if they don't agree with what's going on
[1:00:57] in your life you can still say
[1:00:59] hallelujah anyhow oh my because you
[1:01:02] recognize one thing I am in the will of
[1:01:11] God
[1:01:12] hallelujah God's will is
[1:01:16] perfect and we want to let his will be
[1:01:18] done I'm coming to something in just a
[1:01:21] moment hallelujah what is the will you
[1:01:25] know the will is that power of
[1:01:28] control that power that controls is on
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:33] mind you know it brings what's that
[1:01:36] power brings things into
[1:01:39] action and one thing that God will not
[1:01:42] take from you and that is your
[1:01:47] will
[1:01:48] hello he'll never take your will from
[1:01:54] you and if if you want your will to be
[1:01:57] taken you must give
[1:02:01] it y'all help me
[1:02:03] here because here was Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ I'm jumping a little
[1:02:10] bit even at a time amen that many of us
[1:02:14] may may would have ran amen from the the
[1:02:18] oncoming uh punishment or the oncoming
[1:02:21] trial you know how you want to get out
[1:02:23] of things
[1:02:26] and we think that when these horrible
[1:02:28] things come upon us that oh somehow I
[1:02:30] must be cursed that's the LIE of the
[1:02:34] devil even when you don't even
[1:02:36] understand what he's
[1:02:38] doing he's doing
[1:02:40] it
[1:02:41] Hallelujah even when you don't have a
[1:02:44] mind of what he's doing he's doing it
[1:02:46] because the Bible said the footstep of a
[1:02:48] righteous man they are ordered by the
[1:02:52] Lord hallelujah and you'll never be
[1:02:55] righteous of yourself your righteousness
[1:02:58] come from God hallelujah and just like
[1:03:01] your righteousness he gave you salvation
[1:03:03] he gave you his
[1:03:05] righteousness see when the devil tell me
[1:03:07] I ain't righteous I tell the Devil he's
[1:03:09] a lie as long as I'm under the blood of
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ I am
[1:03:13] righteous Hallelujah let me move on
[1:03:17] Hallelujah and God will always give that
[1:03:20] give you the power to
[1:03:23] choose here was a perfect man
[1:03:27] we call him
[1:03:29] Jesus and he was about ready to go to
[1:03:34] the place called
[1:03:37] Calvary he was in The Garden of
[1:03:41] Gethsemane what you hear what I'm saying
[1:03:44] he was
[1:03:45] perfect at no point in
[1:03:49] time did he ever do his own
[1:03:52] will matter of fact he said I can do
[1:03:54] nothing except I see the father's doing
[1:03:57] it and when he does it that's when I do
[1:04:01] it but there in the Garden of Eden we
[1:04:05] discover something here he was Humanity
[1:04:08] versus
[1:04:10] God and here was Humanity saying Lord I
[1:04:13] would did this cup pass from me and I
[1:04:15] don't know about you many times I would
[1:04:17] the cup
[1:04:19] pass but your Victory is in this Lord
[1:04:23] not my will but thine be done
[1:04:27] done hallelujah see we are chosen people
[1:04:32] we are special class of people we are
[1:04:35] people that God has handpicked we are
[1:04:38] elected by God we've been chosen for
[1:04:41] this
[1:04:43] hour God and through types this Bible is
[1:04:47] right hello somebody sir this is God
[1:04:51] urum is that all right yes sir if you
[1:04:55] let me let me go on now we're
[1:04:58] coming let me say it like he wants me to
[1:05:00] say
[1:05:01] it you know when it comes
[1:05:04] to the Ark of the Covenant when it comes
[1:05:07] to the holy place when it comes to the
[1:05:11] Tabernacle there's a place in the Holy
[1:05:16] place where there was a table of shoe
[1:05:19] bread I'm just going to cuz I don't want
[1:05:21] to be long there's a table of shoe bread
[1:05:24] and that table of shoe bre bread that
[1:05:27] bread was placed on what we call a
[1:05:29] golden
[1:05:31] lid and that golden lid was there to
[1:05:34] draw the attraction to the
[1:05:37] bread it was speaking that though this
[1:05:40] be bread is deity upon
[1:05:45] deity
[1:05:46] Hallelujah and you got to understand
[1:05:49] that this bread was made but it wasn't
[1:05:52] completely
[1:05:53] risen until it got got into the presence
[1:05:57] of the almighty God we call that
[1:06:01] shakina that's how this Bible
[1:06:03] is it is the bread of
[1:06:09] life but you can't even
[1:06:12] digested until shakina
[1:06:15] comes and you can read this Bible all
[1:06:19] day with an intellectual mind and you
[1:06:22] won't even understand nothing
[1:06:26] but when you read this
[1:06:28] book when you prayed up all of a sudden
[1:06:32] the the simple things that you you miss
[1:06:35] jumps up out of the pages Hallelujah sir
[1:06:39] you see now the bread is risen now the
[1:06:42] bread is fully
[1:06:43] cooked and now you can eat and
[1:06:46] enjoy oh somebody help me here see what
[1:06:50] it is this is what what even even even
[1:06:52] David said Lord thou preparest the table
[1:06:56] before
[1:06:58] me what in the presence of my enemies th
[1:07:03] anoint my head with oil and my cup runs
[1:07:07] over he did it yesterday and he's doing
[1:07:10] it again
[1:07:11] today he's taking the same bread the
[1:07:15] same
[1:07:15] word and he's preparing the
[1:07:19] table the table has been prepared where
[1:07:22] in the presence of my enemies amen but
[1:07:26] in that place hallelujah amen he anoints
[1:07:30] me see you can't work it without the
[1:07:33] anointing that's why we can't oh you
[1:07:35] know it's amazing how people of the
[1:07:37] message have killed the anointing you
[1:07:40] can't work it without the
[1:07:42] anointing Hallelujah we need the
[1:07:46] anointing of God we need the Shak of
[1:07:49] Glory of God hallelujah people you can't
[1:07:52] be
[1:07:53] afraid that's right even David said
[1:07:56] though I walk through the valley in the
[1:07:58] shadows of death I fear no evil
[1:08:01] Hallelujah where do you think you're
[1:08:03] walking now yes sir in the shadows of
[1:08:05] death everybody's afraid of the corona
[1:08:09] Hallelujah but I fear no evil I'm not
[1:08:13] saying it ain't real but one thing I

[1:08:26] and one thing I love about it I'm
[1:08:28] skipping everything but anyway it
[1:08:30] doesn't matter I'm going preach what he
[1:08:31] wants me to preach you and I must
[1:08:34] understand when it comes to this you
[1:08:37] know the Ark of the Covenant and how
[1:08:39] Moses saw it out there and how he saw
[1:08:42] the outer Court the inner court and the
[1:08:43] holies of holies amen we doing just like
[1:08:46] Israel we're seeing these things as just
[1:08:48] being pieces of
[1:08:50] furniture but understand all those
[1:08:53] pieces represented one God
[1:08:56] represented the work and manifestation
[1:08:59] of God throughout the ages Hallelujah
[1:09:03] when the Bible tells us we you know
[1:09:05] that's what we do we say
[1:09:07] candlesticks the Bible tells us Amen in
[1:09:10] Zechariah it's
[1:09:13] Candlestick not something with an s on
[1:09:15] it is only one God so when you see I'm
[1:09:19] telling you something I'm getting ready
[1:09:20] to comes to something if you just bear
[1:09:22] with me because a lot of us will be
[1:09:25] behind and

[1:09:30] revelation there's something that God is
[1:09:33] trying to get to us we've come out of
[1:09:36] organization we've come out of
[1:09:38] denominations but

[1:11:03] message is bringing us
[1:11:05] to not to be another church and what has
[1:11:10] happened to the people in the message we
[1:11:11] have fallen in love with the
[1:11:13] system instead of Christ we've done the
[1:11:17] same thing amen the Methodist did we've
[1:11:20] done the same thing amen the Lutheran
[1:11:23] did we've done the same thing amen the
[1:11:26] Pentecostals have done they have
[1:11:29] preached and the people believe in a
[1:11:32] system instead of the moving of the Holy
[1:11:34] Ghost Hallelujah we need to see God on
[1:11:38] the scene yes sir this
[1:11:41] message is not to be just letter this
[1:11:45] word me is meant to be
[1:11:47] lived somebody help me here oh my God
[1:11:52] Peter said listen what we've done and I
[1:11:55] always I wish I had a diagram but you
[1:11:57] know what at my church I show those
[1:11:59] seven Church ages and I said and each
[1:12:02] one of those ages typed out a church
[1:12:05] that was bound by
[1:12:09] laws
[1:12:11] rules
[1:12:13] regulations not that the spirit was
[1:12:17] bound yet it
[1:12:20] was but we needed someone to lead us out
[1:12:24] of captivity
[1:12:27] and the only one who could lead you out
[1:12:29] of captivity is this
[1:12:31] day is God
[1:12:34] himself now we look and we say well
[1:12:37] brother what are you trying to say we
[1:12:39] understand that Zachariah said the seven
[1:12:41] count he said his it was a man it was
[1:12:44] and then we see in Revelation the word
[1:12:45] of God says he was in the midst of the
[1:12:49] golden
[1:12:50] candlesticks what was it it was God
[1:12:53] divine nature God Amen showing his acts
[1:12:58] throughout the seven Church ages can God
[1:13:02] change people
[1:13:05] say we've come into
[1:13:08] Perfection but we don't need that
[1:13:10] Pentecostal stuff no
[1:13:13] more that is a
[1:13:15] trick and a lie of the
[1:13:18] devil you need
[1:13:21] everything the word restoration means to
[1:13:23] bring back that which was boss
[1:13:26] Hallelujah you can't be restored
[1:13:29] Hallelujah if you take one word out of
[1:13:31] this Bible God said your life will be
[1:13:35] taken if you add anything it'll be the
[1:13:38] plagues will be added to you Hallelujah
[1:13:41] but what are we looking for we're
[1:13:43] looking for the will of
[1:13:47] God
[1:13:48] hallelujah thou preparest the table
[1:13:51] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:13:55] David said I ain't
[1:13:58] scared because thou anointest my head
[1:14:01] with oil and my cup run
[1:14:05] over hallelujah what was it those seven
[1:14:09] golden candlesticks were there stick
[1:14:12] were there that candleabra how however
[1:14:14] you want to say it that manora was there
[1:14:17] to give them
[1:14:19] light and the light that this manora
[1:14:22] brought them to was the incense
[1:14:27] I'm I can't preach it all but the
[1:14:29] incense that led right before the
[1:14:33] veil now what was this incent it was the
[1:14:36] prayers of the Saints you know why I
[1:14:39] said that the denominations the seven
[1:14:42] Church ages represented the law because
[1:14:45] that's all we
[1:14:46] had rules and regulations you can't do
[1:14:50] this touch not taste not handle not Paul
[1:14:52] said we're beyond that
[1:14:55] Hallelujah when you've got to constantly
[1:14:57] tell people how to dress where to go
[1:15:00] where not to go Hallelujah that's
[1:15:03] foolishness that's not the hour we're
[1:15:05] living in we're living in the hour of
[1:15:08] the Holy Ghost we're living in a time
[1:15:11] where God is
[1:15:13] living when God can teach you right from
[1:15:17] wrong hallelujah it's in my heart is
[1:15:20] that right that Melody of Praise it's in
[1:15:23] my heart it's no longer on the
[1:15:27] pages oh God help me I had a mama who
[1:15:31] couldn't read or right but she knew
[1:15:34] Jesus see that's what matters right
[1:15:38] now people say listen brother Brooks
[1:15:42] I've really been trying to come up this
[1:15:45] ladder from Faith virtue knowledge you
[1:15:48] can try all you want to you'll never get
[1:15:51] there by your human efforts
[1:15:55] Hallelujah it takes the grace of God yes
[1:15:58] sir somebody help me it takes the grace
[1:16:01] of God to take you up there but guess
[1:16:05] what there must be some incense in your
[1:16:08] life there must be some prayer in your
[1:16:11] life you say God I want to go there you
[1:16:14] know what God says but you need to kneel
[1:16:16] in
[1:16:17] prayer I'm telling you
[1:16:19] something Mo if this thing is about
[1:16:22] ready to run you crazy it's only because
[1:16:24] you're not
[1:16:27] praying Hallelujah you've got to find
[1:16:30] the will of God for you right now is
[1:16:33] that right listen here was God he says
[1:16:37] I'm going to call my son out
[1:16:38] of Israel out of Egypt and here was
[1:16:42] Israel amen led by a prophet to come out
[1:16:44] of Egypt and here why she's crossing the
[1:16:48] Red Sea and how many of us know with the
[1:16:50] Red Sea it represented the blood of
[1:16:52] Jesus Hallelujah nothing like the blood
[1:16:55] of Jesus but that blood Sanctified them
[1:16:59] Justified them excuse me Justified them
[1:17:02] but the Bible tells me according to
[1:17:03] Deuteronomy 8 God took them out there in
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:07] wilderness to try their
[1:17:10] hearts
[1:17:12] Hallelujah you say I want the Holy Ghost
[1:17:14] well I'm going tell you something God is
[1:17:16] going to try your heart if you really
[1:17:19] want
[1:17:20] it you'll let him try
[1:17:22] you and you'll saying All Things To God
[1:17:26] Be The Glory no matter what he brings
[1:17:29] your way it'll be to God be the glory
[1:17:34] those seven golden candlesticks let me
[1:17:36] move on was Christ in the midst was the
[1:17:38] full manifestation of God God's nature
[1:17:41] manifested and
[1:17:43] revealed Hallelujah and now we who are
[1:17:46] the bride we come in a
[1:17:50] place where it looked like it was all
[1:17:53] over God had judged Leo to
[1:17:58] seea and she was found wanting weighed
[1:18:02] in the
[1:18:03] balance but she was
[1:18:05] blind and
[1:18:07] naked and didn't know it but there was a
[1:18:10] small elected group of people let me
[1:18:15] tell y'all something this this
[1:18:17] Revelation is
[1:18:19] not it's not a
[1:18:23] bundle it's not something amen you
[1:18:26] because you're a friend with this one or
[1:18:27] a friend with that one you believe one
[1:18:29] two three we going to make a Rapture no
[1:18:32] sir this is a
[1:18:35] individual walk with God and you've got
[1:18:38] to have him like that song say just like
[1:18:41] the Bible
[1:18:44] says it doesn't matter how much you know
[1:18:48] in this message it doesn't matter if you
[1:18:50] can quote the prophet of God and I want
[1:18:52] you to understand there's nothing wrong
[1:18:54] with the quote
[1:18:56] but it doesn't matter if you could quote
[1:18:59] everything even this Bible you've got to
[1:19:03] go back to the basis have you received
[1:19:05] the Holy Ghost since you believe and you
[1:19:09] say well brother boo what are you trying
[1:19:10] to tell me let me tell y'all something
[1:19:12] there's so many people in this
[1:19:16] message have been birthed by a system
[1:19:19] and not by the Holy
[1:19:22] Ghost and they're trying to break BR
[1:19:25] Perfection by a system that's exactly
[1:19:28] what what the Jews
[1:19:30] did and the more they tried it was like
[1:19:34] a leopard licking his spots the more he
[1:19:38] tried to clean himself the more sinful
[1:19:41] he became you can't clean
[1:19:44] yourself it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:19:48] sanctify you Hallelujah y'all understand
[1:19:51] what I'm saying sir this is what I can't
[1:19:53] stand I can't stand it because people
[1:19:57] they say they got the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost and when the word is being
[1:20:02] preached there is no sign of
[1:20:05] Life Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:20:08] something about babies even if a baby is
[1:20:11] hungry and when they see Mama approach
[1:20:14] the
[1:20:15] room they don't say give me my knife and
[1:20:18] fork they go for it they start licking
[1:20:22] their
[1:20:23] lips they know was
[1:20:25] coming and just like mama is excited
[1:20:28] that child is excited too Hallelujah why
[1:20:33] because that baby knows he needs or she
[1:20:35] needs
[1:20:37] nourishments I don't understand people
[1:20:40] but when I come to God I I come to the
[1:20:43] church I come to be
[1:20:45] nourished I come to be fed I come to get
[1:20:49] from Jehovah jyra amen what I need
[1:20:52] Hallelujah and he's still go ahead he's
[1:20:56] still he still is
[1:20:58] Jehovah Lord and when you say by God's
[1:21:02] grace Hallelujah those incense right
[1:21:06] before the curtain let me say it like
[1:21:08] this in our day just like it
[1:21:12] was in Jesus's day we got
[1:21:18] fakers many of them carried on like the
[1:21:22] ark was behind the curtain
[1:21:25] many people are carrying on like the
[1:21:28] Holy Ghost is behind the
[1:21:30] veil but you can tell by their
[1:21:34] actions it's just an empty
[1:21:37] space hallelujah oh they can act
[1:21:41] religious they can do all the religious
[1:21:43] things but one thing about religious
[1:21:46] people they cannot recognize the word
[1:21:49] when it's right there in front of them
[1:21:52] is that right here was the word word
[1:21:55] right in front of those Sadducees and
[1:21:57] Sadducees but instead of calling him the
[1:22:00] word they called him a
[1:22:02] devil why because they were born of a
[1:22:05] system they did not know God and that's
[1:22:07] what's happening right now many are
[1:22:10] going to miss the Rapture because they
[1:22:12] have a system they know how to shout
[1:22:15] they know 15 30 minutes they know how to
[1:22:17] do it they keep it all together but have
[1:22:20] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:22:23] believe
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] woo and the Holy Ghost is not just a
[1:22:29] feeling the Holy Ghost will change you
[1:22:33] Hallelujah that's what the Bible said
[1:22:35] he'll change you from glory to Glory
[1:22:38] Hallelujah I hope somebody understand
[1:22:40] what I'm talking about Hallelujah here
[1:22:43] was a Living
[1:22:46] Word The Living Word right in front of
[1:22:49] them living it they saw the miraculous
[1:22:55] huh they knew what Jesus was doing but
[1:22:58] they couldn't see him they couldn't see
[1:23:01] him in human
[1:23:03] flesh they did just what Israel has
[1:23:06] always done they tried to keep God in a
[1:23:09] box is that right you see that's what
[1:23:12] Israel did even when Israel lost the Ark
[1:23:15] of the Covenant to the Philistines they
[1:23:17] felt like they couldn't win they they
[1:23:20] they felt like there was no no strength
[1:23:22] of height that's not where God wanted to
[1:23:25] remain that whole thing was about them
[1:23:29] but they was too blind to see it that
[1:23:32] God was looking for a temple that God
[1:23:35] was looking for somebody that he could
[1:23:37] use among
[1:23:38] Israel Hallelujah God even then wanted
[1:23:42] to be manifest but they thought God is
[1:23:45] just in that box can you imagine
[1:23:49] hundreds of years knowing that he's not
[1:23:52] behind the curtain knowing that the Ark
[1:23:54] of the Covenant is lost but you got to
[1:23:56] fake it that God is with you Hallelujah
[1:23:59] people let us not be
[1:24:02] blind Hallelujah you got to be a new
[1:24:05] creature you're not some patched up job
[1:24:09] you got to be born again all things must
[1:24:11] become new see denominations represented
[1:24:15] the patch up job turning over a leaf
[1:24:19] it's not turning over a leaf it's about
[1:24:21] turning a new life and I think a lot of
[1:24:24] time we take the religion and we think
[1:24:26] that's it y'all better hear what I'm
[1:24:30] saying religion won't get you there if
[1:24:33] religion was going to get you there then
[1:24:35] God would have said unto Adam and Eve
[1:24:38] that's okay I really like that leaf you
[1:24:41] God hallelujah but that leaf wasn't good
[1:24:44] then and it ain't good now y'all hear
[1:24:47] what I'm saying amen what is the will of
[1:24:51] God now I'm going go ahead on now cuz I
[1:24:53] done said enough in that area but I want
[1:24:55] you to understand when that that veil
[1:24:57] was rent hallelujah what happened you
[1:25:00] know what
[1:25:02] happened those Jews still ignored the
[1:25:07] fact that God wasn't with
[1:25:09] them and what did they do they conspired
[1:25:13] against the
[1:25:16] word and here was the very Ark of God
[1:25:20] hanging on the cross y'all hear what I'm
[1:25:22] saying here was the very word of God
[1:25:26] made manifest here was The Mercy Seat
[1:25:30] standing hanging right there and they
[1:25:33] couldn't see it but there was one
[1:25:36] man one man out of all of those who
[1:25:39] persecuted him a
[1:25:41] thief was able to look over
[1:25:45] there say Lord when you come into your
[1:25:49] kingdom have mercy on me what was that
[1:25:53] that was prayer
[1:25:55] Hallelujah he said I'm
[1:25:58] unworthy but by the grace of God have
[1:26:01] mercy on
[1:26:02] me Hallelujah that's how it is with the
[1:26:05] bride of Jesus Christ she's not puffed
[1:26:07] up she can't be
[1:26:09] prideful because she realized Hallelujah
[1:26:12] she is really
[1:26:13] unworthy and the only one amen that can
[1:26:17] make her Worthy is the one who was
[1:26:19] crucified for her hey somebody because
[1:26:23] you and I must understand hallelujah
[1:26:26] what God is doing right now he's looking
[1:26:29] for somebody who wants to do his
[1:26:32] will regardless of the
[1:26:35] persecution regardless to whether
[1:26:37] anybody knows what you're doing it ain't
[1:26:39] about your
[1:26:40] church it's about you finding the will
[1:26:44] of God the Bible says in Genesis
[1:26:48] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[1:26:50] own image after our likeness and let let
[1:26:53] them have Dominion see we see those
[1:26:56] things which okay we're in the image of
[1:26:58] God but his will was also to let them
[1:27:01] have them
[1:27:04] minion is that all right we're not
[1:27:06] called to be church members we are
[1:27:09] called to manifest God's Dominion y'all
[1:27:14] hear me Amen on this Earth that's why
[1:27:17] the Seven Seals were open that's why
[1:27:20] those Seven Angels Came Down in the
[1:27:22] cluster what was it it was the capping
[1:27:25] off of the church it was a new
[1:27:27] dispensation it was turning a corner it
[1:27:30] was God hallelujah bringing us up higher
[1:27:34] so let me say it like this because you
[1:27:36] and I must
[1:27:38] understand at the Jordan after Israel
[1:27:41] crossed the red seed that was the blood
[1:27:44] but now after the Wilderness experience
[1:27:47] in Deuteronomy said God tried their
[1:27:48] heart he didn't find no one
[1:27:52] worthy other than two Joshua and Caleb
[1:27:55] that's right that was the only two out
[1:27:57] of that generation he tried their hearts
[1:27:59] and they failed what was it they weren't
[1:28:02] willing to give over to the will of God
[1:28:07] and he said to them man does not live by
[1:28:10] bread alone but by every word that
[1:28:12] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:28:15] that's God's will that we live by every
[1:28:18] word but brother Brooks how I'm going to
[1:28:20] live by every word you can't do it
[1:28:22] without the Holy Ghost
[1:28:26] Hallelujah with all your human effort
[1:28:28] you can look as righteous as you can't
[1:28:30] be and nobody can look as righteous as
[1:28:33] the Pharisees did and when Jesus came
[1:28:35] the judge of all he said you are dead
[1:28:38] men
[1:28:39] bones Hallelujah I don't want to be dead
[1:28:42] men's bones I don't want to rest upon
[1:28:45] music to bring me joy I don't want to be
[1:28:48] resting upon money or any kind of
[1:28:50] Earthly gift to give me joy you know
[1:28:53] where Joy come from the Bible said in
[1:28:56] his presence when I'm in his presence
[1:28:59] Hallelujah there's fullness of joy as
[1:29:02] long as I'm in his presence I've got
[1:29:06] joy Hallelujah you know everybody want
[1:29:09] to come to church to get joy that's
[1:29:11] temporal that's just like the woman at
[1:29:13] the well with her water pot you still
[1:29:16] working with a system God said get rid
[1:29:19] of that I can give you a river I can
[1:29:22] give you a well that will spring up into
[1:29:25] eternal life you won't have to worry
[1:29:28] about it Hallelujah wherever you are
[1:29:31] I'll be and wherever I am you will be
[1:29:35] Hallelujah because I am you are that's
[1:29:39] what Paul says I am what I am Hallelujah
[1:29:43] is that all right you know we must
[1:29:46] understand what Jesus Christ was and
[1:29:48] what he is the Bible said he was the
[1:29:49] beginning of God's
[1:29:51] creation Hallelujah is this okay
[1:29:54] so we realize by God's grace God's will
[1:29:56] was to bring in a perfect man that's why
[1:29:59] the scripture says amen that here was
[1:30:01] Adam the first Adam was a natural man he
[1:30:03] failed the human part of you is
[1:30:07] failure will always be failure sir
[1:30:11] Hallelujah but this other part Jesus
[1:30:13] said I am a quickening
[1:30:17] spirit and this quickening spirit is
[1:30:19] what the Lord of Heaven I'm going ask
[1:30:22] you a question now how do you
[1:30:25] know that the Holy Ghost is in your
[1:30:31] soul how do you
[1:30:35] know what vindications have you had to
[1:30:39] make you know that he's in your
[1:30:41] soul because once he's in your soul it
[1:30:44] erases all
[1:30:46] doubt it erases all fear oh God am I
[1:30:50] going to make it don't stop it is a
[1:30:53] union
[1:30:55] with God
[1:30:56] himself you so how do I know just like
[1:31:00] it was in that
[1:31:02] Tabernacle
[1:31:03] Hallelujah in the in the in the inner
[1:31:07] Court in the Holy
[1:31:09] place which was your
[1:31:11] spirit as long as light was in there you
[1:31:14] was
[1:31:14] fine Hallelujah but understand the
[1:31:18] spirit part of you is the emotional part
[1:31:21] but in your soul there's only faith
[1:31:23] Faith or doubt there's no
[1:31:27] emotions Hallelujah but when God goes
[1:31:31] back there and you come back there when
[1:31:34] he and you are there and he has accepted
[1:31:38] all of your sacrifice and plus your
[1:31:42] prayer hello all of a sudden the shakina
[1:31:46] of Glory come down y'all know what I'm
[1:31:48] saying when the shakina of Glory comes
[1:31:51] down then that priest began to dance
[1:31:54] hallelujah amen holy holy holy let me
[1:31:57] tell you something you say you got it
[1:32:00] and you ain't got no movement I doubt
[1:32:05] it won't even
[1:32:08] cry oh I got
[1:32:10] it I'm not saying you got to dance like
[1:32:13] me but I just know one
[1:32:16] thing when you're born again it's
[1:32:18] nothing but a
[1:32:20] mess and some of us ain't ready for it
[1:32:24] Hallelujah see but what is it you got to
[1:32:27] die to your will you've got to cross
[1:32:29] what not the Red Sea you got to cross
[1:32:32] the mighty Jordan the mighty Jordan
[1:32:35] shows you what your will is like you say
[1:32:38] that ain't will yes it is because the
[1:32:40] first thing God tried them
[1:32:42] on was the word and their will glory
[1:32:46] glory when you go in the land and you
[1:32:48] conquer don't you take
[1:32:51] nothing from them
[1:32:54] Hallelujah but aan will was still
[1:33:00] living Hallelujah and when aan chose His
[1:33:04] will over God's word it brought death
[1:33:08] not only to aen but I thought I think
[1:33:10] it's about 300 people died because of
[1:33:13] his will see you breaking the word
[1:33:16] doesn't affect just
[1:33:19] you it will affect the whole
[1:33:22] word for him that knowth to do good and
[1:33:24] doth not the Bible said it's
[1:33:28] sin I'm trying to encourage you it makes
[1:33:31] not sound like it but that's what I'm
[1:33:33] trying to do don't let the devil fool
[1:33:35] you sanctification is good enough good
[1:33:38] but it ain't good enough you need a
[1:33:41] revelation that you really got the pill
[1:33:43] of fire on the
[1:33:45] inside Hallelujah that's your kind of
[1:33:48] Glory that's what people don't
[1:33:50] understand hallelujah we're here to be
[1:33:52] living Epistles
[1:33:54] written and read of all men and all of
[1:33:56] us says Lord I Need Love how can you be
[1:33:59] behind the veil and can't love your
[1:34:10] enemy hello what was it Jesus and and
[1:34:15] y'all got me all on the other side of
[1:34:16] this thing but just like Jesus amen was
[1:34:19] there on the cross and this is one of my
[1:34:22] favorite when he said said Lord forgive
[1:34:26] them for they know not what they
[1:34:29] do as far as I'm concern it proved he
[1:34:33] was the son of
[1:34:35] God because only sons of God can truly
[1:34:40] forgive is this okay now I done skipped
[1:34:45] a lot of things but listen we don't need

[1:35:32] before God and God has given him those
[1:35:35] songs to sing you're not resisting him
[1:35:38] you're resisting the Holy Ghost somebody
[1:35:41] help me
[1:35:44] here you think the musicians aren't part
[1:35:48] important you think they're here for
[1:35:50] just a
[1:35:51] show I don't Brothers I don't even know
[1:35:54] why I'm going this way but you know the
[1:35:56] thing is you must understand they're not
[1:35:58] here for a show they want the
[1:36:01] Shak they want to see
[1:36:05] God and when you resist them you
[1:36:08] resisting the Holy
[1:36:11] Ghost the day on
[1:36:13] Pentecost the Bible say they were all on
[1:36:16] one
[1:36:17] Accord and the Holy Ghost came
[1:36:21] down when we began to deny our will and
[1:36:25] says God I'm coming to church and I want
[1:36:29] to see you I'm denying my will I might
[1:36:33] feel tired but I'mma give all I got I
[1:36:35] may not feel good but I'mma give all I
[1:36:38] got God you going to know my heart
[1:36:40] because I'm going to give all I got
[1:36:42] Hallelujah I want your will to be done
[1:36:44] not just in my life but in everybody's
[1:36:47] life
[1:36:49] routine Hallelujah whom the son is set
[1:36:52] free is free indeed
[1:36:54] Hallelujah when we get to the place
[1:36:56] where just 45 minutes is going to
[1:36:58] suffice us amen it is a
[1:37:03] routine it
[1:37:04] may and it may
[1:37:08] not but Jacob says I'm not going to let
[1:37:12] you go until you bless me I didn't come
[1:37:16] to church amen to walk out like I came
[1:37:19] in I came to be blessed Hallelujah and
[1:37:23] if I'm the only one that's going to be
[1:37:25] blessed I'm going to be blessed but I
[1:37:28] want you to be blessed while I'm being
[1:37:31] blessed hallelujah oh glory to
[1:37:35] God
[1:37:37] woo
[1:37:40] God hiding in Simplicity he said they
[1:37:44] couldn't even see it and on that cross
[1:37:46] they said if thou be the Son of God save
[1:37:50] yourself said the thief to him and if
[1:37:53] thou be the Messiah come down off the
[1:37:55] cross show us if you're the king of Jews
[1:37:59] if you're the one this come down and
[1:38:01] show us see that wouldn't been showing
[1:38:05] Authority God was humbling himself you
[1:38:08] know where I'm trying to bring you I'm
[1:38:10] trying to bring you to this
[1:38:11] hour of
[1:38:13] humbling
[1:38:15] yourself this is the hour of
[1:38:19] humility this is the hour of humbling
[1:38:22] yourself y y'all better hear me go ahead
[1:38:25] because though he was Lord of all he had
[1:38:28] to Humble
[1:38:29] himself for the own coming
[1:38:34] event he had to go and
[1:38:37] pray until he prayed so he vly Amen to
[1:38:40] the drops of blood and many of us can't
[1:38:43] give him 10 minutes and we see the time
[1:38:47] approaching Jesus said this is the hour
[1:38:50] where the son of man is going to be
[1:38:55] what
[1:38:58] persecuted this is the
[1:39:01] hour where I'm going to be
[1:39:04] tried this is the
[1:39:06] hour and I know I can't make it on my
[1:39:11] own maybe some of y'all can but I know I
[1:39:14] can't make it on my own and he prayed
[1:39:19] and he prayed and he prayed Hallelujah
[1:39:21] and then the Bible said like Jacob you
[1:39:24] know like Jacob he wrestled and he
[1:39:26] wrestled and he wrestled we don't
[1:39:28] believe in that no
[1:39:33] more we forget the laws of sewing and
[1:39:38] reaping you s little you going to reap
[1:39:42] little you s much you going to give much
[1:39:46] you say oh that's not necessary I'm
[1:39:48] elected I'm chosen where so was Jacob
[1:39:55] but he had to
[1:39:57] wrestle Hallelujah so was see more but
[1:40:01] he had the
[1:40:03] wrestle and we have been so
[1:40:06] indoctrinated amen with this Holy Ghost
[1:40:08] without sensation to so many people are
[1:40:11] just absolutely dead show me the life
[1:40:15] then if you ain't got the sensation show
[1:40:17] me the
[1:40:20] life I want to see the life
[1:40:25] not just a moral life many people live
[1:40:27] moral lives but these signs shall follow
[1:40:30] them that believe you cannot strip that
[1:40:33] from the pages this book is
[1:40:37] you it's me we the fullness of the word
[1:40:41] the Bride of Jesus Christ being
[1:40:43] manifested in her day
[1:40:47] hallelujah oh come on somebody it's not
[1:40:50] enough to say what William Brandon was
[1:40:51] he did what he's supposed to do
[1:40:53] now who are you and what you come for
[1:40:57] Hallelujah you think you're going to get
[1:40:59] it riding on a e a bed of easte it ain't
[1:41:02] happening this is not an intellectual
[1:41:05] Revelation this is a born again
[1:41:06] Revelation and the only way you going to
[1:41:08] get it it's just like Jesus on Your
[1:41:14] Knees all night prayer don't even talk
[1:41:17] about it you got to have the Living Word
[1:41:21] all right y'all understand what I was
[1:41:23] just reading he said God was humbling
[1:41:27] himself in Simplicity taking on the form
[1:41:29] of death God the highest form of life
[1:41:32] become the lowest cursed of Life a
[1:41:35] sinner to die to bring forth
[1:41:37] Resurrection oh my God hiding
[1:41:40] himself in death to show himself in
[1:41:44] Resurrection God the highest form and
[1:41:46] what we fail to see and this is
[1:41:48] something brother Su said to me and I
[1:41:50] really believe
[1:41:51] it is that that revelation struck him
[1:41:54] that he had God in flesh living with
[1:41:59] him his
[1:42:01] wife was God in flesh living with
[1:42:05] him how many of us feel feel that about
[1:42:08] our
[1:42:10] wives how many wives feel that about
[1:42:13] their
[1:42:14] husbands y'all hear what I'm saying in
[1:42:16] other words she lived
[1:42:18] it so he could say that that was God
[1:42:21] that wasn't Mary that was God in
[1:42:27] flesh oh God help me that's the
[1:42:31] testimony we
[1:42:33] want that if we do come to the end of
[1:42:35] our journey amen somebody could say that
[1:42:37] was God if I ever seen God anywhere
[1:42:41] that's the closest I've ever seen he
[1:42:43] lived such a life I seen
[1:42:47] it never amen was there hypocrisy in his
[1:42:50] life he never spoke evil about no
[1:42:53] one oh come on somebody he was always
[1:42:57] blessing and blessing and blessing even
[1:42:59] though people was cursing him and
[1:43:00] cursing him and cursing him he still was
[1:43:04] balanced the love of God conquered y'all
[1:43:07] hear what I'm saying I'm not preaching
[1:43:09] you a message or a sermon I'm preaching
[1:43:11] you something that I know came from
[1:43:14] God we want his
[1:43:16] will no matter
[1:43:18] what Hallelujah remember that later her
[1:43:21] husband was a drunkard
[1:43:24] he brought his friends home said I'mma
[1:43:26] show you something my wife is a
[1:43:30] Christian cuz those men who were drunk
[1:43:32] as say never have I seen any Christians
[1:43:34] no such thing he said come on over here
[1:43:37] with me so I'm going let her know she
[1:43:39] going to prepare me meal for us and we
[1:43:41] going to sit at the table what happened
[1:43:44] he she prepared that that food
[1:43:47] Hallelujah and then all of a sudden he
[1:43:49] acted up I don't want this threw it all
[1:43:51] on the floor

[1:43:58] back she broke out why you know what it

[1:44:15] the presence of the Lord no matter what
[1:44:17] Satan brings your away he can't get
[1:44:20] beyond the fire

[1:51:56] all confessions must be
[1:51:59] made there is no way you're going to
[1:52:01] progress in Christ without
[1:52:04] confession not to
[1:52:06] me to
[1:52:08] him y'all hear me confession is very
[1:52:13] important if you confess your sins he is
[1:52:17] faithful and just to forgive your sins
[1:52:20] and to cleanse you from all
[1:52:23] unrighteousness and as long as you don't
[1:52:25] confess you're not going nowhere if sin
[1:52:29] is in your
[1:52:30] life y'all hear what I'm saying but the
[1:52:33] moment you confess your sins you don't
[1:52:36] have to do pentant you don't have to
[1:52:39] wear a sad
[1:52:40] face Hallelujah you don't have to ring a
[1:52:44] bell the moment it leaves your mouth
[1:52:47] from your heart God forgives you just
[1:52:49] then somebody say well brother Brooks
[1:52:53] you know that might produce a hypocrite
[1:52:55] no it won't if it came from the
[1:52:58] heart I'm not talking about a system
[1:53:00] like the Catholic Church well I confess
[1:53:03] to the pope and I'm
[1:53:04] clean no you're not Hallelujah now
[1:53:08] listen if we confess that he is we've
[1:53:11] been in his presence and we have
[1:53:12] confessed our sins they are all blotted
[1:53:15] out in the book of his memory there's
[1:53:18] nobody but God who can do that is that
[1:53:22] right
[1:53:23] you can't forget what somebody's done to
[1:53:25] you but you can forgive them y'all hear
[1:53:27] what I'm saying oh people of God I know

[1:53:33] y'all ready to go I know some of y'all
[1:53:35] tired but I am
[1:53:38] too but this must be said because that's
[1:53:41] the lateness of the hour I pray that you
[1:53:43] have not allowed your will to shut the
[1:53:46] will of God off in your life right now
[1:53:49] you're going to need it because God
[1:53:53] ain't coming back for church members
[1:53:54] he's coming back for a bride who's made
[1:53:57] herself ready whose love
[1:54:00] disappearing that's why people attack
[1:54:02] the cloud that's why they PR attack all
[1:54:04] these things let me tell you something
[1:54:05] God interpret his own word and who are
[1:54:10] we to tell God he's interpreted the
[1:54:12] wrong way is that right oh it's the
[1:54:16] truth a lot of us still believe that God
[1:54:19] going to crack the sky this big Jesus
[1:54:22] going to show up and all the planes
[1:54:24] going to
[1:54:25] crash people going to raise up out of
[1:54:27] the Grave bus drivers going to crash
[1:54:30] their
[1:54:31] cars he said it' be a secret catching
[1:54:35] away everybody ain't going to know it
[1:54:39] won't be revealed to
[1:54:41] everybody can I make just one little
[1:54:43] story and I'm going close because I want
[1:54:45] you to know where I'm going with this I
[1:54:48] I say it like this brother random told
[1:54:51] little stories
[1:54:53] and he told a story about
[1:54:56] this little girl who was a cousin to
[1:54:59] these rich girls and he liking these
[1:55:01] rich girls as denomination they were
[1:55:03] Pentecostals and they could shout and
[1:55:05] they could dance and they could they
[1:55:06] were they were in the sh shindig because
[1:55:09] they wanted the owner's son to choose
[1:55:11] them as a
[1:55:13] bride but there was this young lady amen
[1:55:15] who was a cousin to these girls and she
[1:55:18] was back in the backyard amen washing
[1:55:21] dishes
[1:55:23] throwing out the dishwasher water and he
[1:55:25] was the Rancher son she didn't approach
[1:55:29] him the message came to
[1:55:32] her and guess
[1:55:34] what he whispered to her things that the
[1:55:38] girls in the other room knew nothing
[1:55:43] about and he even told her he says
[1:55:46] listen I'm looking for someone of
[1:55:49] character and you fit the is description
[1:55:52] of woman I want the other girls didn't
[1:55:55] hear
[1:55:57] it he said listen and there's a story
[1:56:01] where it says not only did he tell her
[1:56:03] that but he also gave her money she
[1:56:06] worked but he gave her money and what
[1:56:08] was the money buy the truth and sell it
[1:56:10] not he gave her a
[1:56:12] message and that message amen was to
[1:56:15] prepare herself amen Adorn herself take
[1:56:19] what you're working see that's what
[1:56:21] people don't understand there something
[1:56:22] you and I must do if you really believe
[1:56:26] he's coming back for you you prepare
[1:56:28] yourself you work you do what you need
[1:56:30] to
[1:56:32] do
[1:56:34] Hallelujah and one thing he said around
[1:56:37] next time around this time I'm coming
[1:56:40] again so she had an
[1:56:44] idea oh when he was coming y'all hear
[1:56:48] what I'm saying the other girls didn't
[1:56:50] know it but when she he told them amen
[1:56:54] that that that he had chosen her as a
[1:56:56] bride to be his bride they mocked her
[1:56:59] they laughed at her Hallelujah but it
[1:57:02] didn't stop her from continuing to
[1:57:04] work
[1:57:06] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:57:09] but you know if you see where he's
[1:57:11] coming from he also in that little
[1:57:13] Parable and that's what I call it that's
[1:57:15] what I call it you don't have to call it
[1:57:16] that it might be just a little story to
[1:57:17] you but I'm just trying to tell you what
[1:57:19] he revealed to
[1:57:20] me because at the second time of
[1:57:24] persecution is when he showed up
[1:57:27] somebody hear me see what we failed to
[1:57:30] see is that this
[1:57:31] persecution that we're getting ready to
[1:57:34] experience is the very season he is to
[1:57:37] show
[1:57:40] up he's coming and so is the
[1:57:44] persecution they laughed at her they
[1:57:46] made her they mocked her to scorn but
[1:57:48] she wasn't worried because during the
[1:57:50] time of their their their persecution
[1:57:53] she was standing there not trying to get
[1:57:55] ready she was in the door
[1:57:57] waiting
[1:57:59] waiting and this thing I love to hear
[1:58:01] him say she heard the sound and she saw
[1:58:05] the dust in the distance every time I
[1:58:08] think about the dust in the distance I
[1:58:10] think about that bomb dropping brother
[1:58:13] BR said before one bomb drop we'll be C
[1:58:16] but we can see it let me tell y'all
[1:58:18] something how many of us believe that

[2:03:54] it it can't be
[2:03:57] done that's the devil's
[2:04:00] lie and is contrary to the
[2:04:05] word I can do all
[2:04:08] things through
[2:04:10] Christ which strengthens me oh ain't no
[2:04:14] word in the brides vocabulary oh I
[2:04:17] can't
[2:04:19] Hallelujah you know it might be I can't
[2:04:21] can't do it by
[2:04:24] myself oh God help me you know it's the
[2:04:28] truth folks you know we look at things
[2:04:30] and I'm almost done you know I I people
[2:04:33] give you signals you
[2:04:36] know I ain't talking about the pastor
[2:04:41] either but I'm trying to tell you
[2:04:43] something if
[2:04:45] Jehovah if Jesus is Jehovah of the Old
[2:04:48] Testament how many y'all believe that
[2:04:52] Jehovah is Jesus of the new but my point
[2:04:55] is this if
[2:04:56] so what is it what what did they
[2:05:00] have and what were they able to do why
[2:05:04] things that you think you can't
[2:05:07] do when we have the opening of the word
[2:05:10] we have the revelation we see amen that
[2:05:14] God has moved us out no it ain't all
[2:05:16] finished because it overlaps there's
[2:05:17] still people amen that God want to bring
[2:05:19] out of that church age into this
[2:05:23] but understand how can you say you in
[2:05:25] the shakina and there is no
[2:05:29] life when God in the shakina this is
[2:05:32] what that y'all understand the message
[2:05:34] of the hour is the word of God that was
[2:05:37] brought out of the sinina
[2:05:39] glory it was behind the veil it wasn't
[2:05:42] just the shoe bread it was behind the
[2:05:45] veil and that word brought life it
[2:05:49] transformed a stick
[2:05:52] you understand me and all the stick had
[2:05:55] to do was lay in the presence of the
[2:05:59] son well why is it the
[2:06:02] change what what's happening that people
[2:06:04] are not
[2:06:07] changing there must be a
[2:06:12] change the problem is we're still under
[2:06:16] law we fail to see that Grace is com
[2:06:18] unto us
[2:06:22] not by power not by might but by my
[2:06:25] spirit and if it's by the spirit I need
[2:06:27] to get into the spirit I need to get
[2:06:30] into that place that's going to change
[2:06:32] me I need to be in there amen that's
[2:06:35] going to transform me that's why the
[2:06:38] devil don't want the spirit in the
[2:06:39] church no more because it is the spirit
[2:06:41] of God that destroyed the yolks and as
[2:06:45] long as we're doing this thing as a
[2:06:46] ritual that's all you're going to be is
[2:06:49] another denomination amen
[2:06:52] amen God help
[2:06:57] us hallelujah I'd rather be put out the
[2:07:00] church because I shout too
[2:07:04] much people say that's just fanaticism
[2:07:07] give me a little
[2:07:10] bit a that's fanaticism give me
[2:07:13] something other than y'all know what I'm
[2:07:15] saying how many of y'all now it's a
[2:07:17] shame but I'm going to say it just like
[2:07:19] this here most of us had a a a better
[2:07:22] time in denomination shouting and
[2:07:23] praising God than we doing
[2:07:26] now huh somebody said
[2:07:30] amen it's a
[2:07:33] truth and that's a
[2:07:35] shame cuz now we got a word that ought
[2:07:39] to make us
[2:07:40] shout oh my
[2:07:43] God Hallelujah in that day we danced to
[2:07:47] the beat my God but David didn't have a
[2:07:50] a Beat David was full of God and he saw
[2:07:53] the AR of the Covenant coming back and
[2:07:54] he
[2:07:55] began I don't need no dance I don't need
[2:07:58] no music Hallelujah y'all understand me
[2:08:02] sir you say that don't mean you got it
[2:08:04] well it mean you got
[2:08:07] something you know I'm saying at least
[2:08:09] you closer to the goal you know what I'm
[2:08:12] saying my point is amen that there's a
[2:08:14] lot of stuff I want to say I just have
[2:08:15] to do something on Sunday the Lord's
[2:08:18] willing but I'm I want you to
[2:08:20] concentrate on this
[2:08:23] the reason why we're in this mess is
[2:08:27] because Eve left the will of
[2:08:30] God she reasoned the word
[2:08:34] away and a lot of us we fail to see if
[2:08:38] God do call us holy that's what isra
[2:08:40] that's what Eve didn't see she was
[2:08:42] already
[2:08:43] perfect but he she did not see the devil
[2:08:46] says listen God hiding something from
[2:08:47] you amen you going to be this that and
[2:08:49] the other and she is let me tell you
[2:08:52] something she broke the word of God and
[2:08:55] she transformed her will from being
[2:08:58] holy to
[2:09:01] lustful and I don't know about you a
[2:09:04] lust spirit is one of the worst you can
[2:09:06] have on
[2:09:08] you all these sanctified people
[2:09:13] sir huh y'all understand me how many yes
[2:09:18] there are times we all have been trapped
[2:09:24] yeah he said oh my God help
[2:09:31] me you got to die to your will the
[2:09:35] reason why your head keep turning is
[2:09:37] because you didn't pray long
[2:09:39] enough you didn't die you didn't rot the
[2:09:42] holy spirit is not with you all over you
[2:09:44] in you and everywhere else the Bible
[2:09:46] said God put a wall of fire about

[2:11:47] only thing I do is go home and come back
[2:11:49] home from church and I I praise God and
[2:11:52] and read his word and yes I'm attempted
[2:11:54] in doing doing things at times but let
[2:11:57] me tell you something I've got to
[2:11:59] focus I have focused I know what I'm
[2:12:02] looking for and I'm pressing toward that
[2:12:05] Mark I don't care people I know that
[2:12:08] sounds wrong to say I don't care but my
[2:12:10] point is I'm going to make it because I
[2:12:13] have made it
[2:12:14] already and that's my attitude and my
[2:12:17] thing is now Lord my purpose is to
[2:12:21] manifest your life under this seventh
[2:12:24] seal right now this
[2:12:28] day ye yeah i' I've come here to do what
[2:12:33] relieve the Earth from her
[2:12:36] groaning y'all hear me the whole earth
[2:12:40] groans and wait for the manifestation I
[2:12:43] am here you are here to relieve the
[2:12:47] Earth from their groaning is that right
[2:12:50] this is you got to know it's true the
[2:12:52] serpents are here the seed of God is
[2:12:55] here but the seed of God listen look
[2:12:58] what the Earth is doing they're trying
[2:13:00] to control the atmosphere they're trying
[2:13:02] to control everything and the more they
[2:13:04] try to control it the more out of
[2:13:05] control it becomes why because the they
[2:13:09] they are not the
[2:13:11] inheritance they are not the inheritors
[2:13:14] of this Earth You
[2:13:16] are you and me we're the ones that that
[2:13:19] the Earth wants to obey we are the ones
[2:13:22] that the wind wants to obey we are the
[2:13:27] ones
[2:13:30] Hallelujah and you and I have seen the
[2:13:34] very power of God coming this
[2:13:37] day we've seen God move and now he's
[2:13:42] trying to find individuals that he can
[2:13:44] move in because God has never left
[2:13:47] himself without a witness Hallelujah I
[2:13:50] might sound like a crazy man but I'm
[2:13:52] serious about what I'm saying you and I
[2:13:54] must understand we've got to wake up to
[2:13:56] something because we' become too dotory
[2:13:58] we've come to a place where church has
[2:14:00] become religion the love of God is is
[2:14:02] leaking from your heart you know the
[2:14:05] love of God is not just because you can
[2:14:06] memorize scripture that ain't it the
[2:14:09] love of God is when you can fellowship
[2:14:10] with him and he can fellowship with you
[2:14:12] like I told somebody I said you know
[2:14:13] David said that he prepared the table
[2:14:15] I'm closing PR prepar the table before
[2:14:17] me in the presence of my enemy you know
[2:14:19] what happens when you prepare the table
[2:14:21] T when you invite somebody over for
[2:14:22] dinner you know what I'm saying you
[2:14:24] don't sit on this end and they sit on
[2:14:25] the other you sit right across from each
[2:14:28] other so you can do what have face to
[2:14:33] face face to
[2:14:36] face communion and
[2:14:39] fellowship this is why Jesus when he
[2:14:41] came in the clouds when he did he he
[2:14:44] came and he seven angels and and they
[2:14:46] actually you I know some you may not but
[2:14:49] anyway you saw the Housman had just saw
[2:14:51] the face of Christ what was he saying
[2:14:53] this is the hour I want to have face to
[2:14:56] face communion with
[2:15:00] you not by way of the
[2:15:02] internet not by way of the telephone I
[2:15:05] want to sit in your presence I want you
[2:15:08] to know that you're in my presence and
[2:15:10] I'm in yours and I want to talk to you
[2:15:12] when he saw that one that one girl there
[2:15:14] at the
[2:15:15] fence right he didn't say hey you over
[2:15:19] there no he got on the fence he got up
[2:15:23] to her so they could commune face to
[2:15:25] face this is what this message is all
[2:15:27] about you said oh brother Brooks what do
[2:15:30] you mean I got Facebook what I do
[2:15:34] too this is my
[2:15:37] Facebook face to face with the word of
[2:15:41] God y'all don't I don't know whether you
[2:15:43] realize what I'm saying but but by God's
[2:15:45] grace it's real I'm just telling you
[2:15:48] it's real
[2:15:51] it's another level and it's real that's
[2:15:54] all I can tell you everybody ain't going
[2:15:57] who think they going but it's real
[2:16:00] somebody going to catch or get
[2:16:01] understanding what I'm trying to
[2:16:03] say God didn't give us this message for
[2:16:06] us just to memorize it to swap and and
[2:16:10] and and and strive with one another
[2:16:12] that's nonsense I don't have time for
[2:16:14] fighting each other that's out
[2:16:17] Hallelujah this is a time for
[2:16:19] love this where you got to love your
[2:16:21] enemy really love your
[2:16:26] enemy but you got to also have a ear to
[2:16:29] hear the voice of
[2:16:31] God you got to know what you're talking
[2:16:33] about too God will tell you he'll lead
[2:16:36] you he'll guide you what if you didn't
[2:16:37] have education what if you didn't have
[2:16:40] it but God is able to lead you you got
[2:16:44] the Holy Spirit and he could tell you
[2:16:45] right from
[2:16:47] wrong let's stand
[2:16:51] I just got to see
[2:16:53] him and the Bible tells us that when he
[2:16:55] appear we shall see him as he is that's
[2:16:57] what this message came for that we could
[2:16:59] see him as he is he's not a
[2:17:05] system he's
[2:17:07] life he's the word of
[2:17:10] God he's my mother my father my sister
[2:17:14] my brother he's my everything I don't
[2:17:17] mean to break down this there ain't no
[2:17:20] acting
[2:17:21] real but I'm going tell you it's later
[2:17:24] than what most people
[2:17:26] think it's later than what we
[2:17:29] think everybody waiting for the
[2:17:32] squeeze it's coming but you better make
[2:17:36] sure you got what it
[2:17:37] takes it's got to be more than a
[2:17:40] feeling it's got to be more than
[2:17:43] churchianity it really has to be God
[2:17:45] that anointing coming
[2:17:49] down brother brother Simmons prayed for
[2:17:51] me
[2:17:52] there when I was in the back room and
[2:17:56] he's prayed for me many
[2:17:58] times but this
[2:18:00] time I felt such an anointing shoot
[2:18:03] through my
[2:18:04] back every every word that he would
[2:18:06] speak it just something took place
[2:18:09] there he couldn't I could not have felt
[2:18:12] that if he didn't have something you
[2:18:15] understand what I'm saying
[2:18:17] virtue and here was this man tired
[2:18:22] weary going through
[2:18:25] things but you know what so many people
[2:18:28] Miss

[2:31:14] says I never seen the righteous forsaken
