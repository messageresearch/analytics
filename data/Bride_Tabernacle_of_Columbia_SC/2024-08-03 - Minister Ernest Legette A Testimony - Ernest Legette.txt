Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen amen we want to look at the book of Acts by the grace of God Acts 26 God is good amen amen thank God it's said for the meetings and the services amen our spirit is revived and uh thank God Amen you Services I believe were blessing to many but we can't let it die amen you know the the Taskmaster he didn't like that he tried to hit you with all kinds of stuff but you got to press your way on anyhow amen amen Acts 26 you got it say amen amen and it reads then a grippa said to Paul Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself I think myself happy king of grippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all things why I am accused of the Jews especially because I Know Thee to be an expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently my manner of life from youth which was at the first among M own Nation at Jerusalem know all the Jews may God bless the reading of his words you may be seated you know here at the 22nd verse it says you know having therefore obtained help of God I continue until this day witnessing both to small and great seeing none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and show light unto the unto the people and unto the Gentiles amen amen you know tonight by grace of God I just want to minister just for a moment on a testimony amen Amen on a testimony now we looking here at you know we know the scene sitting here you can read it you know sometime at home uh you know this is Paul here and how he's been brought before you know King G gripper and he's being accused of you know the Jews and all about you know and he had a lot of times you know people want to kill him amen some even made vows that they wouldn't eat or so forth till they killed him but so he was being persecuted heavily at this time but even in that I I I Marvel how he says you know to King AG gria he says I'm happy amen I'm happy right now so he begin to tonight I want to talk about a testimony amen and maybe it won't be too long but I I says you know Paul what he was doing right here if you go back and read it he was telling his testimony he he begin to talk about his early life and how he was raised and all but then he began to not only that talk about how he had a Zeal for God and talk about how God met him one day amen and that was that was really the turning point in his life when God met him am you know and that should have been the turning point in each and every one of our Lives amen amen you know uh we can talk about certain things that happen in our life certain things we achieve and all those things but the moment that God came into your life that was I don't know about you but for me that was the Turning Point amen come on you know I think about Moses Moses was Prince of Egypt and all that right he might have had a lot of things he could have talked about or or had but you know what was a turning point in moses' life was when he turned to see that great sight and he met he met the pillar of fire right that that that same man that was born of a woman he'd never be the same again after meet after meeting the burning bush he would never be the same again and everywhere he went he would talk about that burning bush experience come on y'all believe that why because that experience changed his life right in so much as we saying even about Paul here in so much that when he told his testimony it had the the I believe it was anointed it had something in it that convinced people or stirred people to make them even the ones that persecuted him to want to get saved Amen to want to meet the same H uh God that he talked about amen I like that and I said not only not only Paul we've been looking in through the book of Acts that whole early church right they had they had t one thing they had was testimonies amen one thing they had in their lives uh that turned the whole world upside down was they knew how to testify come on they knew how to tell people what what that they weren worthy in and what God had done for them come on they knew not only how to tell people but what it was God was vindicating their testimony why because in all what they were doing they were giving God glory y'all believe that tonight come on and that's what you and I as individuals ought to be on our heart no matter what in this life you don't want just testimonies so people look at you but what it is you got to be giv God the glory and all things you know God is God is so good to us God is so good to us all the time ain't it in this world The World Is Gone Insane ain't they I was telling them at the job the other day I was throwing dumping some trash behind the building and this guy walks up I look I'm looking I I said I thought he had a guitar case you know this man had a rifle on his back and another book sack I don't know what he had in it walking behind the building so I called the managers and all and nobody respond I call I call 911 they asked me 50 questions about them and they showed up two hours later I said they don't even want to deal with the craziness today right because the world is gone insane right but you know I I thank God he he didn't uh he didn't bother me or but he just I said you know this we don't know people have lost their minds ain't they we don't know way people are mentally sometimes but I thank God that when nobody don't come to the rescue God will amen that's what it is he's keeping a hedge about us but I want to talk about a testimony amen that that early church you know looking at them I says they had a testimony right they they had they can tell you uh just like as we ought to be able to tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus and it's so much that it convince people right it's not I was telling brother Damian yesterday you know it's not in all that you know I say I can tell people hey I I'm a preacher come hear me preacher or let everybody know in the world that I'm a preacher right I says and that's good I says but the life you live yes before those people amen because you can yell that you're a preacher from the top of your voice or you're a Christian from the top of your voice but your life you live is going to have way more weight am to the person that you told that to than all that you could ever say to them the life that you living amen the way you the way you handle situations amen come on now I believe that the way your manner of talk your manner of speech I believe it that even the most the ones that was against you persecuted you hated you but your manner of speech the way you the the way you handle that situation with love come on the way you handle that situation with patience amen come on with kindness not getting into the spirit of the world but but portraying the spirit of Christ the way you handled that situation come on that it has such an impact on them that even they want to know what's what's the driving force behind your joy Hallelujah am come on you know sometimes you talk to people and they say you don't drink you don't do this you don't hang out man you you born what do you do I says the thing is the world today they can't have pleasure without without it dealing with something of the flesh majority of the world come on their Joy comes from something fleshly right their their peace what they think of come as peace comes from something that's only that's only pacifying or making this flesh feel good amen I says but if you want to know what the source of my joy is hallelujah come on he is the source of my joy says how can you have joy when everything around you like Paul you in Chains you being judged how can you say I'm happy how can you be glad because he is the source of my joy amen come on Amen how can you be at peace when your ship is being tossed come on because I found what real peace is amen see you can't understand that peace if you ain't never had it before come on you don't know what that Joy is like if you don't you ain't never had it before come on and that's why as I was sharing brother Damian people they run to all other sources come on Amen I I don't know your pain Hallelujah I don't know what you been through I I might have not been what you've been through come on but I know one thing I know who is the answer for it Hallelujah I know who can solve all of your problems come on I believe that tonight there ain't a problem that God can't solve come on he's the hero of all heroes like they say come on he'll show up every time come on but I says what it is your testimony come on you know I was thinking the other day cuz I was witnessing uh to the guy I'm always you know talking to somebody about the Lord and the Lord if the Lord is truly in your life you can't help but to talk about him come on and tell because what it is the Lord is Blessing you so much right and sometimes people want to look at you and say oh you this and that but but how can you open your mouth without giving God some glory amen come on Amen how can you open your mouth without praising God and telling somebody how good God is am stop telling them that if it wasn't for God you wouldn't even be here today come on if it wasn't for God you'd be a beggar out on the street somewhere what for God come on where would you be yes sir I don't know where I'd be Hallelujah I don't want to think of where I would be but the Turning Point came one day come on Amen Hallelujah yes it did the Turning Point came that's what it is you got to have an experience to where you can say my life was never the same come on something changed I was telling a guy at work the other day I says the thing is I can I might have broke my promises with a lot of people and I might have done it sometimes unintentionally right I said but one person I I just can't see myself breaking my promise with and that is that is Christ amen amen I said because where I was at Hallelujah and where he came and got me from come on and he didn't he didn't have to do it somebody say oh he a benefit no I wasn't nothing that you could benefit from come on I was a I was a nothing nobody amen Cast Away come on Amen but Jesus came yes and what he where he got me from Hallelujah I asked him to come in my heart one day I ask God if you help me I I I I promise you to the best of my ability I serve you the rest of all the days of my life and I was sharing to God said now that's a promise I intend to keep amen come on Amen no matter what it takes out my life that's a promise Hallelujah and you know one thing God knows your heart too that's what it is God know what's in there right but as I was beginning to testify we said a testimony come on I was beginning to testify and and and the boy at work he said Ernest he said nobody can't tell me how good God is he said I know for myself how good God is then he started telling me his testimony and how somebody his his wife and his little baby was sitting out on the porch and the little baby was 7 months old and some boys run up to them and held a gun on his wife and his baby and brought him in the house and he said Ern as I I didn't know what to do he said when one of them turned away I dived on them and he said they pulled a gun out and shot me in the stomach he said uh I didn't even realize I was shot he said but my wife did and he says she dragged me and he said I didn't know where I was shot at but it shot her in his stomach and he says but he says it had to be Angels there is what he said he said I wasn't serving God then but he said it had to be God there cuz he talked about how the bullet it shot him in his stomach missed all the the main everything right enlarged in there but he said they just sewed them up so beautifully that you can't even really tell how they had to gut him up and all but he was saying how he from then be to believe that God was real because he said even when I wasn't even thinking about him or even going he says I know that was God hallelujah amen that done that amen come on and I I begin to be stirred while he was telling me his testimony amen amen hallelujah and I said that's what it is don't let them testify allbody s come on amen God saved you for you to tell somebody come on now for you to let somebody know how good he is that's why God brought you through that come on GL he didn't let you go through all that to sit down and don't say nothing about it those early Saints was telling somebody about Jesus amen come on now amen they was wasn't they yes Lord come on but he was telling me that all that and I was stirred when he telling me right and I I was saying uh so then he was telling so I was telling him my testimoni and more testimonials and he said Ernest he says you know he says I haven't been to church church now in over a year though he says he says me and my pastor we done fell out I said who your pastor is he said TD Jake I didn't mean to call that name but he's he's actually used to go to a church in Mullins his wife is from Mullins and he said that after that they would drive from up here every day to go to Mullins the church in Mullins I mean not every day but every Sunday right just to be in the house of God but he says something happened in the church and it kind of you know offended his his family a little bit so they hadn't been back but he I began to tell him I said oh you shouldn't have let whatever happened knock you away from what God did to you cuz that's what it is don't you know the devil did that come on God God I remember brother Simmons telling me and I I keep telling that testimony he often he told me once that if you be around me long enough I'm going hurt your feelings or I'mma do something you ain't going to like or some stuff you ain't going to agree with he said you might get upset with me or some people in this church you might want to leave the church he said that's fine he said but if you leave the church whatever you do don't leave God amen amen and I thought that was real amen because God ain't never did nothing but be good to you come on man going to fail you all the time come on now your mom and daddy will fail you your brothers and sisters will fail you those close to you will fail you but one thing about God he'll never fail you not only he'll never fail he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you come on God promised to be with you at all times come on through the thinking then am Hallelujah everybody turn and walk talk about you come on call you all kind of names whatever they false accuse you but one thing I believe Paul could say that that that same light that he met that voice that he heard never left him amen come on now amen and that's what keep you when you keep your eyes on the right thing Hallelujah and that's the one that died for you the one that shed blood for you the one that picked you up out of the market of my reclaim Hallelujah that's what keep you going y'all believe that come on I'm stirred tonight you know one thing about those them and their testifying they wasn't testify with arrogance neither the to make it seem like they had way more than everybody else had but their testimony was on the saving power of Jesus Christ their testimony you you can hear Paul's talk about it all the time was on the grace of God how I'm not worthy to even be a partaker of this Grace come on but if God can save a right one like me Hallelujah it don't matter what you done tonight come on Amen it's the grace of God that we preaching it's the love of God that we preaching come on and that'll draw being into repentance want it come on oh Jesus come on now amen the life you live out to draw somebody to repentance amen come on Amen out to call somebody Hallelujah and want that guard that you got it's got to be that way I believe that your life got to be that salty amen that somebody want they want to know amen what's the source yes where it all coming from hallelujah amen and you can lead him down the calvary I believe that tonight come on but I said a testimony come on I was sharing that and I was talking to boy and then you know he wants to come to church now he says man where you go to church and I explained to he says it ain't that church with that always be got something going on out there in the field I said yeah that was that's us he said oh man I'm coming he said then he started asking me about Doctrine and what y'all believe in so I went into a little little with him right but I said one thing about one thing about it I'm I'm learning that when God is doing something you don't have to add nothing to it come on come on Amen I was freshly telling the testimony how one guy at work he told me a few years ago he didn't believe in God and was questioning me who I'm praying to and all that stuff he was going on and on but some bad storms came in his life come on some things start hitting real hard in his life took him down a bad in dangerous path right but one day he got in the car with me and he saw all these Bibles all around the car and he asked me for one you know just that little move right there he's been coming to me now testifying about what God has been speaking to him come on and you know what I say is one thing about it I'm starting to realize is you know you don't have to mess with it if God is working with somebody you let God do it amen come on and get out his way let God do it come on now God knows exactly what to do he knows exactly how to speak to that person don't he he knows exactly what they need for the time they need it Hallelujah am let God do it I believe it that's what we need more of hallelujah it's God doing it I believe he can do it too come on we still got to pray come on but prayer I believe bring God on the scene amen come on and when God start working just thank God Hallelujah start praising him but I say what it is a testimony come on your life has got to be a testimony y'all believe that tonight I don't want to be long tonight but I says that what it is you know I says I says God you know I want my life to be in such a way that you know it's so it's real salty everybody around you you know they they want what you got come on Amen and what can you talk to them about but the grace of God Amen you know sometimes God can God can do be doing a lot for you and you still cannot be satisfied amen I thought about Israel I said now they had a testimony coming out of Egypt and all that and in the wilderness experience they had a testimony but no matter what God did for him they weren satisfied was they they always found something to complain about didn't it come on in so much that it upset God didn't it right that's right and he told them all of you die in the wilderness come on and the children is said they going into the land but you murmured and you complain so much having I've been so good to you but yet you only open your mouth about what you don't have and what what ain't happened but yes I but I've been don't let your complaints outweigh your praise come on don't don't let your complaints be more in the praise that come out your mouth come on I ain't going to let that happen I said Lord I when it when it before it even come out your mouth let me catch it for it come out my mou turn it into a praise come on because every situation could have been worse if God Hand wouldn't have got on it I believe that Hallelujah come on things happen around us all the time you know I was at at the job I said this been a trying week one of the guys we didn't have to plan didn't even know it but one of the boys fell out they thought he had a heat stroke or something but the whole crew over there responded and we had a meeting the next day and the the big big guy he was thanking everybody said 37 years I never seen a whole crew respond the way y'all did to save that boy's life but I said the thing is I says things can turn in a moment can't it come on you can think you in control and all of a sudden something happened right but that's what it is how can I have like like I said somebody wanted to know where that Joy comes from where that peace come from it ain't from me it's because I know the one that holds it all sir come on I'm serving the one who is the joy Giver I'm serving the one who's the peacegiver who's the lifegiver come on Paul said I know I'm standing here about to be judge Hallelujah but I'm happy to talk to you today if you got a little time come on just paraphrasing let me tell you my testimony ever since I was a child and way God brought me from come on and in the end what he say you almost persuaded me come on I believe the anointing was there I believe his testimony was so powerful Hallelujah come on and God wants your testimony to be the same way tonight come on now go out and tell somebody about Jesus go out and tell somebody about the goodness of God and what God did for you you can't you don't know what to say thank him for waking you up this morning thank you for giving you a good sound mind and lungs and legs and arms come on praise God with him hallelujah amen Jesus Hall praise God you appreciate the word tonight praise God I thank the [Applause] Lord thank you you know I was listening to that testimony and I I thought back I was up just up to the hospital and with my brother John and when the doctor said you know they had to you know otate his leg and I say you know everybody's feeling I was praying for a miracle that God would just you know make him whole and regardless of what they saying Gang Green and this and that I said well Lord you can if you can raise Lads from the dead which just stinking for 4 days God you can turn everything around but nevertheless they went and they did it and I thought about brother Johnson and uh he said brother Simmons he said I was in so much pain you know with that leg he said but I feel so much better with it's gone amen amen and you know and he he learned to be grateful and thankful with what he had amen and I said you know you got two legs you got a mouth you know you to give God glory Jesus to thank God for it you take it for granted that you got it but are you giving God thanks and glory for what he give you amen praise God we got to start thanking God not for what we don't have but what we do have and we got to look and say God I got something to be happy about [Applause] Lord I got something you're good to me in spite of all the devil is saying to my mind amen he's bringing all kind of stuff to you telling you how bad things are am but you got to look up amen Shake somebody hand and tell them God is good God is good are you with me God is good I know it's a lot of bad things can happen in life but you got to say God in spite of all the bad I said you're good because I all you got to do is look around and see the conditions of others and you can say thank you Jes Jesus Lord thank you Jesus thank you [Music] Jesus [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] H I saw him going in and out with his mind and and look like he didn't know where he was and all of that and I said Lord restore his mind and then it's the day everything is normal amen with his mind that's the Lord keep his mind [Music] amen it don't take long am you ever been going somewhere and forgot where you was going I'm talking about y'all little young people y'all never been going somewhere and forgot where you was going looking for something and forgot what you were looking for amen yes what am I looking for I have a god you see that's how easy it is to lose your mind it don't have to come back you know but it does amen and you say thank you Jesus amen thank you for uh let me know why I'm in this room looking for what I'm looking for then say oh thank you it's so easy to lose it but thank God for keeping my mind you ought to thank God every moment it's so much you can thank God for instead of I'm stand around well I wish I had this and wish I had that and I don't have this and I don't have that and the devil did this and the devil did that no praise the devil praise God thank God for what he's doing so I'd like to thank God for the word tonight and brother Ernest brother Jeremiah those and how diligent everybody [Music] work everybody worked so hard during the tent meeting and most people was bragging on the young people how hard they were working said yeah those young people working hard and they was bragging on how hard they work but all of you how many of you enjoyed the tent [Music] meeting you know God blessed us with a little finances it's very very costly you know I was looking at some of the hotel bills and I said oo but that's all right God is still good a't that right and I'm saying it's worth it these Hotel bills and then you try to be a blessing to the Brethren and all but it's worth every penny I believe you know some folks I can't afford it what can you afford and I this is one thing that got on my mind whatever ever you do I thank God for all your labor and all your support but whatever you do do it as unto the Lord don't never do it for the church don't never do it for the pastor don't never do it for individuals do it as into the Lord so when you hear somebody the quickest way to curse yourself is say I did this and I did that and and nobody appreciate me and nobody care I I've been doing this for so long and uh you know no I don't get no recognition and I don't this and somebody don't appreciate me that's the quickest way to curse yourself amen if you want to go down quick and you want God to get angry with you because you never did it for the Lord but if you did it unto the Lord and you did it because of God's grace may God get all the glory all the money you gave all the things you did you is to the glory of God Amen and we do it with a cheerful heart and we don't never well I did this and I when you open your mouth like that you lose everything are you up me I'm faithful the church oh I just went through some things and and I it's very disturbing because every time I look around when people get discouraged the reason why they get discouraged because they can they can think that all they done and yet our folks don't recognize them and all I'm doing for the Lord is better to be just as quiet and humble and just do don't it doesn't matter a lot of things that I do that's big nobody don't know nothing about L they sneak and try to find out if I do something big I know not to tell nobody cuz they're going to say you crazy man why you did something like that what wrong with your mind see what I'm saying so a lot of times you just keep that quiet to yourself and my wife say I don't want to know I don't want to know I don't want to tell her either she don't want to know and I don't tell her are you with me and likewise when you do don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing okay but some people real knows it they'll find out and they'll tell it too and they going to make you look bad you know what he did he did this did that are you with me but um I want to thank every one of you for your labor and this is what um brother on Thursday night on last night Elijah came up to this uh widow woman and she had two sons and they was going to put put them in bondage and I want to say this he said what shall I do to thee what shall I do to thee what you want me to do for you and I thought about the Saints and working so hard my wife said you need do something for the Saints they done did something for all these people and work so hard you needed something but what shall I do for thee what can I do for y'all y'all think about it and see whether we can do something you know as as y'all work so hard and labor so hard for everybody else well what can I do for thee okay that's what I want to ask because sometimes you need to feel appreciative that somebody appreciate you at the same time you know you did it to the Lord nevertheless it's if it's in our PA to say thank you we want to say thank you not only in words but also In Deed God bless you let us stand thank you for brother car being here with us tonight too

said no that ain't going that won't be a good time then we have to resort back to when we've been having it okay but we want to know from y'all okay God bless you I didn't want to take nothing away
