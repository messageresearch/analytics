hallelujah amen we appreciate that song we appreciate all the songs that have gone forth on tonight amen and man I I I I counted a privilege and an honor to stand before you tonight and uh to deliver a word with Ernest called me last week and he asked me about speaking and uh we we had a a schedu in Conflict at the moment and uh he he he put me on the slot for today so hopefully I can share something with you on tonight to be of encourage I want to thank uh my church family for being here I see a few of them out there on tonight let's give them a hand clap of praise amen I don't know who's all out there but I've seen a few familiar faces but I want to thank my wife and my daughter amen I don't know where I would be without her she she called me around about close to 5:00 brother and she said uh where you at I was on she was making sure I didn't forget amen so ask for your prayers on tonight I appreciate my pastor been here tonight my dad amen let's give him a hand clap of Praise appreciate my family am man I'm just glad be here on tonight I ask for your prayers I'm a little tired in the flesh but the spirit is willing on tonight amen I'm not going to prolong your time I want to go straight to the word here we'll start here in Galatians chapter I mean 6 we'll go to two passages here gal Galatians 6 and9 and we'll go to Hebrews 10:35 as we all stand in honor of the word amen Galatians 6 and verse 9 it says let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season somebody say due season in due season we shall reap if we faint not there's a clause there if you don't faint you will reap and due season let's go to to Hebrews chap 10:35 Hebrews 1035 and it says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward and I want to take from a title tonight cast not away your confidence amen let us pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this opportunity on tonight Lord to come before your people Lord and deliver a word of encouragement to them oh God lord ask that you move myself out of the way that you may have your way on tonight amen let us all say together amen you may be seated man before I I you know brother erest called me I was kind of praying and seeking God on which direction to go on tonight and I was tossed back and forth between two areas uh and uh Wednesday night bible study my my dad he he don't know that he was hitting on so much of what God was dealing with me on and he referenced a quote from the prophet and right when I heard that quote uh I knew that was confirmation uh because I'm I'm I'm new at this so I can only preach what come from the heart all right I don't know a lot I'm not deep it's simple but I I'm learning brother is to stay in my Lane till God tells me to turn on the signal amen I'm going stay right where he has me but this this topic here Hebrews 10:35 is is a very familiar passage of scripture if you Google uh scriptures for encouragement it would probably take you to this passage it's one I've heard a lot of times in my life and it's a very familiar passage of scripture and it's definitely one that you should shout about but it's it's a scripture that holds a lot of weight and in order for you to really catch the Revelation behind this you've got to understand the force that's driving the weight behind this passage of scripture uh we we know the theme of Hebrews is is better you know it talks about being faithful it talks about how God is better than the Angels how he does no longer offers a blood sacrifice he's better than that but if you read this passage of scripture it's like okay we got to do better than cast out away your confidence but you've got to understand who the writer is talking to In this passage of scripture he's not talking to Sinners he's not talking to people who are Sinking Deep in sin and far from the peaceful Shore he is talking to Believers people who believe in God people who know that God is real God is true and he's telling them cast not away your confidence so these and I think in order to understand that you you you can identify with the scripture because I believe we all in here are believers right so if you've never been in a situation to where you've been TI know in my walk with Christ there are times where I just need a little bit more energy Lord you know if you you lifting weights I work out from time to time and they give you a rep a 12 or 10 and when you start out you start out strong on rep one rep two rep three but once you get to about eight or nine you tend to get tired something starts to happen and you need a little bit more energy to push you through and these are what these people are experiencing here in Hebrews chapter 10 they are experiencing a moment in their life to where they are tired okay they are exhausted they are completely to the point to where they need some strength now we live in a world of social media church to where if we need some uh support or if we need some encouragement we can go to Google we can look up something very quickly we can go to social media but these are letters that are being written okay and by the time this letter gets to them they're to the point that they are ready to throw in the tire they are spiritually exhausted they are people who says Lord I know what your promis is I know you're real I know that you are faithful oh yeah but what is taking so long see it's easy to have faith in God church when he answers your prayer tonight when he answers your prayer tomorrow maybe next week but where are you when it's 5 years down the [Applause] road when it's two to 5 years from now you get to a point to where they are what is taking so long Lord and if we've been honest we get like that sometime in my walk with Christ am I talking to real people out there or are you some of those people that don't never get tired everything going good for you we find oursel or these people found their s in the space to where they started asking themselves questions they start making declarations I'm not waiting no more forget this thing called faith you've been talking about I'm just going to do it myself Lord because I'm tired of waiting I am spiritually exhausted now here let me give you some symptoms of what spiritual exhaustion uh causes one is idolatry oh yeah seeking satisfaction in things that don't ultimately satisfy such as alcohol or partying and things like that another uh uh symptom of spiritual exhaustion or being spiritually tired is busyness come on becoming consumed with doing and not slowing down enough to sense God's presence you see that today people so worried about what other people doing trying to put people in put people out trying to label people when they're missing what God is trying to do in their life so busy I think about Martha she was busy doing the wrong thing she forgot the very person she was serving was right there in her house amen busy doing something that was good and she was missing the essential thing that she needed that's right one example or or or symptom of of spiritual fatigue or burnout is misalignment with God's [Music] purpose feeling like you you're doing the right thing but you're completely out of the will of God you think about Saul people think look at Saul the spirit of the Lord left him and isolated from God but here's the thing when it triggered when God was disappointed when Saul disobeyed Saul still won the war he still W that will fire you and still let you keep your job out of the will of God sometimes we think just because we're applying the right practices and doing the right things and we're budgeting right and we got money in the bank that we're in the will of God right on we we we find ourselves as I read this pastor the scripture Church in the same situation this church was and the writer is telling them don't throw away your confidence as a believer in Christ we get to the point to where we have to know how to navigate through those situations to where we feel like we are spiritually drained and tired when you've been praying for God lord I come to the altar I know you can make a way but at this point I'm tired of singing I'm no longer No Ways Tired what happens when you've been singing that song for five years you're ready to get to Lord You're a way maker you're ready to get to Lord I've seen you move you're ready to get to the next song in your life you've been quoting that scripture uh weeping may endure for night but joy come in the morning and you're wondering Lord when is my morning going to show up it's been 5 years later I'm waiting for the sun to break amen amen I said we're not talking about cases where God shows up right then the there but when you go 6 10 years and you've been praying for it this is where this writer finds them he says don't throw away your confidence they are in a situation to where the church remember these are believers these are Christians these are people who know God is real but he is telling them don't throw away your confidence amen amen amen amen now he says the words Cast Away and and and I I kind of did some digging into those words cast not away if we can put that scripture back up there says the words cast not away they are taken from the Greek word that that is pronounced Oppo Balo which is a compound of words APO and Balo the words cast not away the word Oppo means away and the word ball means to throw something such as a ball rock or some other object when these two words are compounded together the new word means to throw away or to discard or to get rid of something no longer desired needed or wanted we see this in Mark 10: 50 blind B it says as he was casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus this is the same uh word that is used now when blind marus got up the reason why he Cast Away His Garment was because it was holding him back it was preventing him from getting to Jesus so the writer is telling him that confidence you got don't discard it like it's the thing that is holding you back from God's promise Lord this is why Hebrews is telling he warns the believer cast not away your confidence because the words cast not away are from the word alabalo the verse suggests that they were so tired and frustrated with waiting for God's promise to come to pass that they was tempted to just throw this whole Faith thing away maybe my waiting is the thing that's holding me back from getting what I need so you have to you have to ask yourself this question how did these this church get to this point to where they were tired yeah the writer answers this question in the next passage of scripture I won't be before you long amen I just want to Brak break down a few points he says here in verse 36 he says for what ye have need of patience right so we understand from this this is a Time issue this is an issue that is related to them waiting for a remember these are believers these are people who believe in God but time has taken its toll on their faith so they are to the point to where they're saying this faith thing maybe it is the thing that is holding me back brother Ernest so they're thinking maybe I should just discard it and cast it away one of the thing the hardest things that God asks us to do sometime and that is to wait waiting does several things number one it exposes our unbelief it reveals our bitterness it amplifies our pain pain it magnifies our weaknesses you think about it you go to the emergency room where you break your leg or something your first response is I got to go to some place that can help me so that first response is what the emergency room you get there you in pain you know this is the place that can fix my problem but you get there and you sign in and they tell you to do what wait wait right while you're waiting guess what you're doing you looking at everybody else go in everybody else who got sniffles and and don't look like they're in pain because your leg is broke what do you start then getting mad getting frustrated oh spiritually you've been praying to God for things in your life and it seemed like everybody else is getting their prayers answered but yours then you start to have thoughts with sister so and so she don't even go to church every day I do why she got a car and I've been praying for one for 5 years on brother so and so is not living right he got healed and I've been praying for my healing and I ain't got it yet everybody else is getting their blessing but my leg is still broke I'm in pain then you start having questions you start asking I call them the five W's you start implementing this in your verbiage from the fruit of your lips when where why what dialogue that causes you to start doubting and and and having disbelief he is telling them don't do that you have need of what patience amen amen one of the most uh if you go to read the about the prophet habach the message in his life is one word and that is weight he says in our backup to 1 and two he says oh Lord how long shall I cry and thou will not hear even to cry out unto thee of violence and thou will not save he's asking Lord how much longer do I have to wait oh this is the prophet he's telling this to God how much longer I'm tired of waiting wait on the Lord what happens when you've been singing that for 5 years and thing you've been promising go that God's promises are yay and amen and you don't see it manifested yet Lord I know you're a good God but I don't feel good right now Lord thank you Jesus over and over we see in the Bible it's about 116 times where the Bible tells us to wait to wait to wait to wait amen but we should ask oursel that this question Church what does it mean to wait on the Lord what does that mean what is what does that look like cuz this is what he's telling them in the Hebrews he's telling them ye have need of patience waited on the Lord biblically said means this to not go outside of God to resolve your issue that's it when you ask God for something you wait until he shows up that's all waiting is don't go outside his will to accomplish what you want amen not taking matters in your own hand that's what happens when when you get fatigued you just start doing stuff trying stuff because maybe this Faith thing is the thing that is holding me back but the writer tells them don't throw away your confidence it is the recompense of your reward amen don't stop declaring who God is what he is Lamentations 3 and 25 we don't have to turn there for the second time he said the Lord is good unto them that wait on him the Lord is good unto them that wait on him to the soul that seeketh him now seeketh is an action the Lord is good unto them that wait on him now here's what I need you to do I need you to keep seeking me I need you to keep coming to church I need you to keep worshiping I need you to keep keep keep keep keep seeking me until I show up that's the action there's a requirement there I'm just going to sit here and I'm just going to wait no you need to be doing [Applause] something amen praise the Lord when we go if we go back and read James 5: 7-13 it is a passage of scripture where James is saying during your waiting don't complain all right just go back and read it we won't go there for the S time but he's telling them when you're going through your season of weit uh do not complain here's why because doubt and complaining and Disobedience results in two things regarding your promise that is delay and denial when you start complaining why they got this and I ain't got it yet Lord I've been praying sister so and so brother so and so you start to complain that a fruit of your lips are not pleasing to God hallelujah thank you Jesus what are some signs of delay when you're complaining instead of worshiping you know Abraham had to wait 25 years for his promise but his promise was delayed because he got tired and it was taking too long what did he do ishmail how many of us right now we look back how many ishs in our lives have we created because it took too long so I'm going go do it myself Lord this waiting thing maybe the Lord just wants me to move faith without works is dead so I mean I'm going go do something here's another part if we can go back to Hebrews chapter 10:35 what exactly is God doing while we wait this this thing this thing caught me church and it was an eye opener for me if we go back to go to verse 36 says for ye have need of patience comma yeah here's the kicker after ye have done the will of God come on now now you might receive the promise now that middle piece the will of God sometimes we miss that we ask God for things not understanding God has a bigger plan at work so if I could sum that passage up five words it's not all about [Music] you the reason you're waiting is God is trying to kill multiple birds with one stone okay I'mma answer your promise however I got some other things that I need to get accomplished I'mma develop you while you wait I'm going to accomplish some things the prayers answered but you got some I need to get done in your life let's let's go to we don't have to turn that but job 23 every every when you talk about God's will being done the purpose uh of God and the way the way he really does not care how we feel our comfort out all those things good story to look at is job job man no one righteous like job good job the one who said on his knees Lord uh uh the lord giveth and the lord taketh away job found himself in a place to where he was tired if you go to job 23: 8-9 job is saying I go forward and he's not there I go backwards Lord I need an answer I mean come on it's been 2 years God I started out on fire declaring that you are good declaring you giveth and you taketh the way the naked I came into this world naked I I came in declaring that now I'm at a point to where I I'm just tired praise the Lord here's here's the thing we got to understand Church God's purpose and his will will always take priority over your timing your sense of urgency your comfort that is the tough thing to be able to digest because when we go to God for promises and we go to God for answers we we expect that God is supposed to just acknowledge what we want how we feel when God says I know the plans I have for you you don't even know what's good for you he knows the thoughts and the plans he has for you he knows what's best for [Applause] you his purpose and his will will always take priority over your timing your sense of urgency how much pain you're in that's right here's one of the tactic the enemy uses church so when we're going through our seasons of weight he wants us to forget God's sovereignty in it all what does that mean that means when you're in God's will and you're pressing your way and you're serving him his sovereignty means that if anything negative happens in your life it had to come to him first amen that means he allowed it that is why the Bible says in everything give thanks because if you allowed it Lord you must know what's about to be at the end of [Music] [Applause] us Bible says give thanks in everything Lord I don't know what the will is for my life that's one of them in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus what concerning you if you don't know the will of your life that's one of them give thanks and everything I just gave you that all right so by placing word words like hope chance what people going to say those five W's the devil wants us to forget God's sovereignty he wants us to focus on who what when I'm going to get it where I'm going to get it where it's going to happen why I ain't got it yet and he wants you to forget about God allowed it and if you're in God's will nothing negative in your life gets to you before he checks it first come on that is the thing job forgot on now in his moment of of of tiredness he forgot if God allowed it he's going to bring me through it oh yes Prophet God said in the message what does it take to make a Christian Life all right he says there isn't enough power in all of hell not that can defeat the purpose of God says God would do it anyhow amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise I'm about done here amen if I can get a little bit more uh volume in the monitors please amen so I want to give an example here um I man that's perfect I want to give an example here of Joseph you think about Joseph's situation and let's go to amen Psalms chapter 105 we start at verse 17 amen he says he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant Verse 18 says whose feet they hurt with feathers he was laid in Iron verse 19 says until the time that his word came the word of the Lord did what tried him then the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go he made him Lord of all his house and ruler of all his substance then verse 22 says to bind his princesses at his pleasure and to teach his Senators wisdom and I want to go to Genesis chter 45 uh we start at verse uh 7 everybody good amen amen verse 7 reads says and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance now we all know the story of Joseph what he went through in his life but when as I reading this pastor scripture there's one word that stood out to me and that is the word [Music] sent now God just didn't send Joseph from point A to point B there were multiple [Music] stops before he gets to this point now how did God send him let's let's break this down a little bit uhuh he's betrayed by his brothers right sold to the Israelites yeah go goes to Piper's house now here's the thing you got to catch in this moment Joseph was praying to get go back home he you think he was okay being taken away from his family the Bible says in Genesis the next chapter it says the Lord was with Joseph when Piper comes to Joseph and accuses him he says I don't want to offend God it ain't about you I don't want to sin against God so that means in this moment he had a relationship that's right you don't have a relationship with God just by being Idol and just waiting that's right not doing anything Joseph had a relationship then he sold he's going to jail then he's doing all these things my point is this the word sent if we can put that back up there all it involves is negative things in his life nothing positive the way God sent him and accomplished his purpose was all bad things that Joseph probably felt was prolonging his promise that's right now church God is doing something bigger than you sir and that is the piece the devil tries to get us to to to misunderstand or forget that it ain't about you if his if you're in the palm of his of his hand that means he has complete control from point A to point B so whatever negative that's in your life God has aligned it for his purpose so Joseph finds himself he says God sent me before you to preserve I see what why I went through that I understand now that Not only was God fulfilling his purpose he was molding Joseph that's right he was building Joseph I'm going to kill multiple Birds Joseph I heard your prayer the first time when you asked to be delivered but in this moment I got a bigger plan for you that you know nothing about so while I accomplish that I'm going to mold you I'm going to cut off the B add pieces that way when you arrive my will can be accomplished because it ain't about you Joseph it's about my glory and what my will is for your life that's what it's about we want God to control every aspect of our life but we want to rush things we want to speed God up lord it's not happening and we prolong the will of God for our life because we try to do things on our own yeah so true Y and that's why the writer tells them don't throw away your confidence amen I know you're tired uhhuh I know you're asking these questions but the confidence you got don't throw it away amen because it's recompense for your reward if we can go back to Genesis um Hebrews 10:36 everybody good amen amen that's what gave Joseph the ability to endure through this moment of these moments in his life what was his relationship with God yeah he worshiped he worked yeah the gift that God gave him he did just sit idle that is what's able to get you through the Bible says that they that wait on the Lord he shall renew which means you going to get drained down when you have to renew something it expires right you go to get a library book that means the deadline is over you got to turn the book in Now You renewed which means now you got new life you can go a few more more days a few more months a few more years amen you should Mount up on wings as Eagles that means God is going to keep you he's going to sustain you he won't put no more on you that you can bear now the only thing you've got to be in his will you've got to be obedient ohy to God you get outside his will what did I say you delay you deny because God's will will be accomplished one way or another Jonah yes oh I told you to go you Tred to do something different I'm going accomplish my will Jonah whether you like and I'm going to use you you can't run I got you written down in my plans so do what you got to do go on on the boat have your fun take your nap you going to get back on the right path one way or another here's the thing with job job could not say in that moment that all things work job knew right there when it happened that he was the problem Hallelujah he knew he was the problem he couldn't be in that situation and said and everything give thanks no you caus this sir this is your doing get back on the right trap get back in my will now you can say in everything give thanks because if I'm in your will Lord if I'm locked in if something comes on in my life that I don't understand I can get on my knees and say Lord thank you because you allowed it I'm doing what you asked me to do Lord I'm serving you I'm coming to church I'm pressing my way the situation that's in my life that I don't have the answers to I can get on my knees and say Lord thank you because you're in control God was in control of every aspect of Joseph's life that's why when you go through the Bible it says the Lord was with Joseph the Lord was with Joseph because Joseph was in tune he didn't get mad and say I'm not going the church today I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that he was locked in God was able to keep him Lord thank you Jesus verse 36 after you have done the will of God you might what receive the promise I want to I want to break down this last passage here and we'll be done amen let's go back to verse 35 says cast not away therefore your confidence now to understand what the writer is saying here with the word confidence that the Greek word for confidence is peria the word means boldness and depicts a very bold Frank outspoken kind of language it carries the meaning of being forthright blunt and to be straight to the point in this verse to the Bold Brave and fearless declarations and Faith confessions regarding God's promises that these Believers had been making all right they had been professing declaring and laying claim to the promises of God's word for their own personal lives they had done it boldly vocally and publicly what they believe they declared loudly so what is he telling them keep talking what you've been talking you saying God Is A Healer you may be still sick in your body but that shouldn't stop your declaration you kid see like they getting worse instead of getting better still claim him on his altar don't stop talking like you've been talking because that is your recompense of reward once you stop talking you start doubting you start disbelieving you find yourself delaying God's promise in your life that is what he's telling them don't throw away your confidence am keep speaking God upon your life am amen keep speaking God's promises in your life over your family over your finances over your health amen amen he's obligated to answer right but he has a bigger plan and in that moment of weit God is doing something church amen and as I read this passage of scripture I said Lord there are things in my life that I have been praying for and I have not seen it manifested uhhuh but I'm going to thank you while I wait cuz I look at like Joseph's life all these negatives there was nothing positive one thing after next God use negativity in his life to accomplish his purpose amen amen and his will so when you going through your stuff don't throw in the towel amen I'm talking to Believers tonight right this is who he's talking to cast not away therefore your confidence amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise I'll wrap up here with Romans 8 Verse 18 it says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time oh are not worthy to be compared somebody say compared compared to what God has in store for you so what you suffering with right now it does not compare to when you get through it yes God's got something for you let's get Lord hand clap praise amen as our brother Ernest come amen let's receive him with a hearty amen amen church I trust I'll share something to be an encouragement to you I'm not going to prolong the time I'm I'm I'm going get on out the way amen God bless you amen you appreciate the word tonight let's give the Lord another hand clap of Praise amen it's something about the word amen but you got to let it find a resting place amen you know it's some things like he was saying about patience and all you know it's something that God does in your life and God as we was say I was saying last week when God want to teach you lessons you can't tell God how to teach you those lessons amen he going to show you how he want to show you that's right amen amen cuz when you come out you're going to be as he saw you not as you want to be sometimes but you going to be as he saw you sometimes we get in so much trouble because we fighting against what the will of God is but we learned early in our Christian journey to let go of all of our thoughts and desires and all those things and say Lord I just want you you know I was talking to brother Simmons as a while back in the office and I was just telling him I was like I says you know I only been on the earth a few years compared to yourself I says but sometimes I think why did I have to go through or deal with so much so early in life I said sometimes I dealt with a lot of things early and in life and sometimes you look at it but I says one thing about it I can look back and say I learned something from all of it I can look back at the lessons if God would allow you to see your path you never would have wanted to go to or deal with certain things but as our brother Maas was saying tonight God's Got You In His Hands he knows the beginning from the end you know what I start saying now when situations arise it might catch you unaware from the beginning but then I say Lord you already knew this day would come before it came God you already saw the situation before it even happened and you allowed it just give me the strength Hallelujah and the patience to go through it and that's my prayer every day you know I was praying I was praying today I says Lord I was thinking about that big shooting that happened in in the neighborhood up there my sister-in-law's neighborhood and I said we living in a different age where you got these kids now toing big guns and in broad daylight they just gunning it out wherever they at and I says Lord we was talking about it at work one of my friends he says he says these children you can't talk to them when they get a certain age he said they friends and things have way more influence on them but I believe that even though sometimes you might say they don't want to hear you but I believe if you get down on your knees yes sir and you pray Hallelujah that they'll hear God one day they won't even know sometimes the choices that they making but it was mama praying for them it was Daddy praying for them it was brother somebody praying for him Hallelujah cuz that's what it's going to take it's going to take God getting a hold of somebody's life amen that's what it's going to take you think about it a brother was preaching T night that confidence don't don't let it slip don't lose it but that confidence was built somewhere sometimes you got to go back down memory lane and you got to encourage yourself in the Lord and you got to think of about where God brought you from Hallelujah cuz he brought you too far to leave you come on I don't believe God brought us this far to leave us the devil get in your mind get you all confused up but sometimes you got to shake yourself and you got to remember the Lord hallelujah and what God's done for you how many want to remember that tonight amen amen let us bow our heads tonight oh Jesus thank you Lord thank you for your grace tonight Lord thank you Lord for the word that we heard God God and we don't want to oh God lose that confidence oh God get weary in our journey even though it happens sometimes God I pray tonight Lord as the word went out God that it gave somebody hope yes Lord that it helped somebody look at their situation and say I feel like holding on a little while longer I know I've been waiting I've been looking for God to move in my life I've been looking for God to do it the devil offer you things left and right but no I'll wait on God yes Lord hallelujah Lord I hope and pray tonight that your faith was incouraged I hope and pray tonight that somebody was blessed somebody that one that was about to let go that one that was about to give up oh Jesus the one that was about to throw their hands up and walk away I pray God tonight that the word found a resting place that it would give him Faith oh God the confidence to know that you can do all things I'mma wait on you Lord I'mma wait on you oh Jesus Hallelujah do you mind waiting tonight oh Jesus somebody just L lift their hands and worship God tonight come on he don't mind being worship tonight our brother said you got to seek the Lord you got to praise him come on you want God to do things for you you want God to move in your life sometimes you got to cry out Lord oh Jesus Hallelujah and I believe God will reach down and touch it tonight I know he will thank you Jesus Hallelujah you know God's grace is so good in our lives come on I know as our brother was saying tonight so many people they get tired they get tired of waiting and they go out and try to take matters in their own hands I like how he use that phrase but when you do that you
