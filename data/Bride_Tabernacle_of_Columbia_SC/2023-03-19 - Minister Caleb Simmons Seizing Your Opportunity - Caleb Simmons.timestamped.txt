[34:34] a familiar scripture Matthew chapter 19.
[34:48] [Music]
[35:04] amen Matthew chapter 19.
[35:06] I know it's a familiar scripture and
[35:08] we'll start in verse
[35:10] 16 this morning
[35:15] when you gotta say man
[35:18] amen and it reads and behold
[35:22] one came and said unto him good Master
[35:24] what good thing shall I do that I may
[35:27] have eternal life and he said unto him
[35:29] why call us thou me good there is none
[35:32] good but one that is God but if thou
[35:35] will enter into life keep the
[35:37] Commandments and he saith unto him which
[35:40] Jesus said Thou shalt shall do no murder
[35:43] thou shall commit thou shall not commit
[35:46] adultery thou shall not steal thou shall
[35:49] not bear false witness however thy
[35:51] father and I honor thy father and thy
[35:54] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[35:56] as thyself
[35:57] in the young man
[36:00] and the young man saith unto him all
[36:02] these things have I kept from my youth
[36:04] up what lack I yet and Jesus said unto
[36:07] him that thou will be perfect go and
[36:10] sell that thou has
[36:12] and give to the poor
[36:15] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[36:18] and come and follow me amen God bless
[36:21] you read another's word you may be
[36:22] seated this morning
[36:24] amen God is good amen
[36:26] this morning I'd like to speak on a
[36:29] short small topic and I I entitled it
[36:32] seizing the opportunity
[36:34] seizing the opportunity amen
[36:37] amen this morning this young man he had
[36:39] an opportunity
[36:41] to do something with it with his life he
[36:43] had his opportunity and Jesus came
[36:45] before me and he went to Jesus and he
[36:47] asked him what can I do what can I do
[36:50] I've done all the things that people
[36:52] have told me to do I've done all the
[36:54] scriptures according to what I'm
[36:56] supposed to do but what else can I do
[36:58] see he had a decided to do something
[37:00] else with his life he had a desire to do
[37:02] something greater with his life and he
[37:04] said what can I do and Jesus said if you
[37:08] follow these Commandments he said I've
[37:09] been doing these since since my youth
[37:12] and Jesus said well I got one more
[37:14] request of you he said I want you to go
[37:17] and sell all that you have and give it
[37:18] to the poor
[37:19] and as you read down in the scripture in
[37:22] verse 22 and I'll keep reading but when
[37:24] the young men heard that saying he went
[37:27] away sorrowful but he had great
[37:29] possessions see this young man came to
[37:32] an opportunity and it was presented to
[37:34] him and he had to make a decision
[37:37] do I go for this opportunity or do I
[37:40] keep what I have am I satisfied with
[37:42] where I am and what position I'm already
[37:44] at or do I go for a greater opportunity
[37:47] and this opportunity that was set before
[37:49] it was greater than what he had because
[37:52] he didn't realize that this opportunity
[37:54] was for eternal life
[37:56] this opportunity was greater than all
[37:58] the possessions that he had on this
[37:59] Earth it was for eternal life but he had
[38:02] to but he came to the position where he
[38:05] had to choose which opportunity he was
[38:07] going to take
[38:08] which opportunity he was going to
[38:10] possess while he was here on Earth and
[38:13] he came and he said and Jesus gave him
[38:16] the opportunity but what did he do with
[38:18] it what opportunity did he take he
[38:21] decided to keep what he had
[38:23] he decided to keep it and he missed out
[38:26] on eternal life
[38:27] and he missed out on going to heaven he
[38:30] missed out on all the riches and all the
[38:32] glory that God was going to give him if
[38:34] he just did this one small thing
[38:37] and see I looked up the word opportunity
[38:39] and it says it's a time or occasion that
[38:43] is right for doing something a good
[38:46] chance see God always gives you an
[38:49] opportunity he always gives you a good
[38:50] chance it gives you something an ability
[38:53] to choose the right thing he gives you a
[38:56] moment in time where you can make a
[38:57] choice where you can make a decision but
[39:00] you have to choose is the opportunity
[39:02] worth it
[39:03] and sometimes someone may come and say
[39:05] hey I got this great this great
[39:07] opportunity if you take this job you can
[39:10] do such and such and so and so and you
[39:12] say you know what that sound good
[39:15] that sound real good
[39:17] or I can stay where I'm at
[39:20] or I can stay here and it may seem
[39:22] stable but you didn't know that this was
[39:24] going to take you to Greater
[39:25] opportunities it was going to open doors
[39:28] because you never could have dreamed of
[39:29] but you said I'm gonna stay where I am
[39:31] I'm gonna stay here because it seems
[39:33] stable it seems like I'm satisfied with
[39:36] where I am but it was a greater
[39:39] opportunity presented for you and that's
[39:41] what God he comes to you and he does the
[39:43] same thing he presents a great
[39:44] opportunity for you he puts it in front
[39:46] of you and say what will you do with it
[39:49] it's your choice it's your choice it's
[39:51] your decision this morning whether you
[39:53] want to choose the right opportunity or
[39:55] stay where you are because whether you
[39:58] know it or not if you're not moving
[40:00] forward you you you're not stand still
[40:02] you may think that you are but it but
[40:05] you're not many of times that you are
[40:08] always opportunities are set before you
[40:10] but you have to make a choice
[40:12] you have to make a choice where am I
[40:15] going with this you may can't you may
[40:17] not see with the levels that this
[40:19] opportunity may give you you may not see
[40:22] all the blessings and things that may
[40:24] come with this opportunity because it
[40:26] may not be shown to you you're just
[40:28] giving a simple opportunity
[40:30] many times is the difference between
[40:32] right and wrong
[40:33] it's just that simple whether you want
[40:36] to make the right decision or not but
[40:37] it's an opportunity you don't look at it
[40:40] like that because maybe you don't see it
[40:42] through the eyes that others may see it
[40:44] I said many of times we come to things
[40:47] what is an opportunity to one may not be
[40:50] an opportunity to another why because of
[40:53] perspective
[40:55] because one can see oh this is going to
[40:58] do this for me but another may say I
[41:00] can't see that it's all in what you see
[41:03] but God has the ultimate perspective he
[41:06] knows the end from the beginning he's
[41:07] Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and
[41:09] the end so he knows what's coming and
[41:12] what shall be and see he said I'm going
[41:14] to give you this opportunity because
[41:15] it's going to lead you to eternal life
[41:17] it's going to lead you to greater things
[41:19] than you can ever imagine but you want
[41:21] to stay where you are
[41:23] see you have the opportunity this
[41:25] morning and this genre truly he had the
[41:28] opportunity
[41:29] to do something better to do something
[41:31] greater but he said I'm satisfied
[41:34] so I want to ask you are you satisfied
[41:36] are you satisfied with where you are
[41:38] this morning are you satisfied with the
[41:40] position that you're at this morning or
[41:42] do you want something greater do you
[41:45] want something that's going to last
[41:46] through eternity because that's what God
[41:48] has to offer this morning amen there are
[41:50] many examples in the Bible where it
[41:52] shows you that many people came to these
[41:54] moments where they had opportunities
[41:56] they had opportunities to do greater
[41:59] they had opportunities to do the right
[42:01] thing but they didn't
[42:03] I think of the story of Cain and Abel
[42:05] there were two brothers that came
[42:07] together and one they they started they
[42:10] had to come and they had to offer a
[42:12] sacrifice it was an opportunity to do
[42:15] the right thing but one didn't
[42:17] understand that that that the sacrifice
[42:19] had to be a blood sacrifice one said I'm
[42:23] just going to offer up I think my best
[42:25] but there was something greater that he
[42:27] can offer up it was something greater
[42:29] there was a greater opportunity for him
[42:31] to take the chance and Cain came to it
[42:34] and he said I want to offer up all the
[42:36] fruits of this field but that's not what
[42:38] God wanted to God wanted the blood to be
[42:40] shed because that's the only thing that
[42:42] could take away sin amen so there was an
[42:45] opportunity but he came and he instead
[42:47] of him instead of him doing what his
[42:50] brother Abel did and offering up a
[42:52] sacrifice that was acceptable he killed
[42:54] his brother he killed his brother that
[42:57] was that was the thing that he did and
[42:59] God came to him and and Cain had an
[43:01] opportunity to repent
[43:04] Cain came and God said where where is
[43:07] your brother he said I'm Not My
[43:08] Brother's Keeper she can't have the
[43:10] opportunity to say you know what I'm
[43:12] sorry I messed up I made a bad decision
[43:15] and and did and I'm repenting of that
[43:18] but Cain decided not to
[43:20] see he took the wrong opportunity he
[43:23] took the wrong path
[43:25] but he could have he had the opportunity
[43:27] to do the right thing because it was
[43:30] presented before him and see God always
[43:32] gives you the opportunity to do the
[43:34] right thing he always comes to you and
[43:36] say you got a choice you can choose
[43:38] writer you can choose wrong but it's
[43:40] your choice I don't force you to do
[43:42] anything that you don't want to do but
[43:44] it's your choice I don't force you to
[43:46] walk in any door that you don't want to
[43:48] walk into but it's your choice and if
[43:50] you hear that voice inside you in your
[43:52] in your head and from your heart that
[43:54] speaks to you and say don't do that it's
[43:57] a choice it's something that's warning
[43:59] you that the there's consequences to
[44:01] what you do there's a there's
[44:03] consequences to the decisions that you
[44:05] make there's consequences to the doors
[44:08] that you walk through the places that
[44:09] you go those things have an influence on
[44:12] you but see there's opportunities to do
[44:14] the right thing there's opportunities to
[44:16] walk through the right doors there's
[44:18] opportunities to make the right decision
[44:20] well what choice are you making each and
[44:23] every day you walk you wake up and God
[44:25] gives you the opportunity and the chance
[44:27] and the ability to make the right
[44:28] decision but what decisions are you
[44:31] making
[44:31] you don't may not see the impact of
[44:34] decision these decisions but they have
[44:36] an impact the Bible says what you sow
[44:39] that's therefore you shall read so what
[44:42] sees your plant in the day that's the
[44:43] fruits that you're going to see of that
[44:45] tree maybe not tomorrow it may take
[44:47] years many times when you go and you see
[44:50] an apple you eat the apple and there's
[44:52] something in the Apple
[44:53] there's a seed
[44:55] and then that seed is an apple tree
[44:58] but you don't see the apple tree when
[45:00] you look at the seed all you see is
[45:02] something very small you see it very
[45:05] small but in there is a great apple tree
[45:07] and see that's that's how your decisions
[45:10] can affect your life
[45:12] you plan to see today but you don't
[45:15] realize the impact it may have 5 10 15
[45:18] years from now if God permits and God
[45:20] Wills but it's an opportunity to choose
[45:23] and do the right thing with that seed
[45:25] it's an opportunity to take that seed
[45:28] you can plant it in good ground you can
[45:30] plant it in good soil or you can plant
[45:32] that seed in Rocky stormy soil and it'll
[45:34] die
[45:35] and see God gives you the opportunity to
[45:38] plant the seed in good ground and he and
[45:40] he fertiles the ground and he tills the
[45:42] ground and he gives the water and Sun
[45:44] like that that seed May grow but it's
[45:46] what opportunities and what choices are
[45:48] you making
[45:49] we come further in the scripture and we
[45:52] see
[45:53] that pilate he had the same opportunity
[45:56] pilate he had Jesus there before him if
[46:00] you look in Matthew chapter 27
[46:02] and
[46:07] Jesus came before him after he had been
[46:09] captured
[46:11] and Judas had an opportunity before
[46:13] Jesus came to pilate Judas could have
[46:16] chosen not to betray Jesus
[46:19] he could have chosen but instead Judas
[46:21] he made he chose the opportunity to make
[46:24] some money
[46:25] he chose the opportunity to make some
[46:27] money and you say what is money in the
[46:29] grand scheme of things because Judas
[46:32] couldn't take the money with him
[46:34] after he got done betraying Jesus he
[46:36] decided to throw the money and try to
[46:38] give it back but he couldn't do that
[46:40] they said what is money to us see the
[46:43] money had no value
[46:45] but Judas took the money in the moment
[46:47] because that was the opportunity
[46:48] presented before him see Judas chose the
[46:51] wrong opportunity
[46:53] but he he wanted the money and then he
[46:55] came and there was another person he
[46:57] come a little bit further in the story
[46:59] there was pilate after Jesus had been
[47:01] captured and taken to pilate pilate had
[47:04] the opportunity to to he had the
[47:07] opportunity
[47:09] and we'll start in
[47:19] let's start in verse 11 and it says
[47:21] 27-11 and Jesus stood before the
[47:24] governor the governor asked him saying
[47:26] art thou the king of the Jews and Jesus
[47:29] said unto him thou say yes and when he
[47:31] was accused of the chief priests and the
[47:33] elders he answered nothing then said
[47:35] pilate unto here here is thou
[47:38] not how many things they witnessed
[47:40] against thee and he answered him never a
[47:43] word in so much that the governor
[47:44] marveled greatly now at that Feast the
[47:48] governors want to release unto the
[47:49] people of prisoner whom they would and
[47:52] they and they had been a notable
[47:54] prisoner called Barabbas therefore when
[47:57] they were gathered together pilate said
[48:00] unto
[48:01] unto them whom will will ye that I
[48:04] release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which
[48:07] is called Christ see the people had an
[48:09] opportunity to do the right thing they
[48:12] had an opportunity that they could
[48:14] choose Jesus or they could choose a
[48:16] notorious criminal but they came and
[48:18] they they colluded together and they got
[48:21] together and they said you know what
[48:24] we don't want Jesus
[48:26] we don't want him let's get the criminal
[48:28] now he was a known criminal and everyone
[48:31] knew him but they said we'd rather have
[48:33] him than have Jesus a man that had done
[48:35] no sin had done no wrong and only was
[48:37] helpful to the people
[48:39] but they had an opportunity to choose
[48:42] the right thing but they didn't
[48:44] and see in verse 18 it said for he knew
[48:47] that for Envy they had delivered him so
[48:50] he pilate the governor knew that they
[48:52] were just jealous of Jesus and that was
[48:55] the only reason that they had brought
[48:57] him to them and see and when he had sat
[49:00] down on the Judgment seat his wife sent
[49:02] out to him saying have thou nothing to
[49:05] do with that just man for I have
[49:08] suffered many things this day in a dream
[49:10] because of him see sometimes when the
[49:13] opportunity is presented before you
[49:15] and you're about to head in the wrong
[49:17] direction God sends you warnings God
[49:20] sends something along your path to tell
[49:23] you hey you didn't listen when I sent my
[49:25] sin of that little voice I'm going to
[49:27] send you something greater to get your
[49:28] attention I'm going to let something
[49:30] happen right in front of you to show you
[49:32] this is the way it's going to go but you
[49:35] can got the opportunity to listen or not
[49:38] many times God comes and he speaks and
[49:40] you hear it and you say oh that wasn't
[49:42] for me oh that was for somebody else but
[49:45] many times that's when God is trying to
[49:47] get your attention and trying to knock
[49:49] on your door and trying to tell you to
[49:51] wake up this is for you this is your
[49:53] opportunity but what are you gonna do
[49:55] with it are you going to just let it
[49:57] pass by are you going to take the
[49:59] opportunity and say you know what this
[50:00] is for me this might not have been for
[50:03] no one else but this is for me and I'm
[50:05] going to seize my opportunity see that's
[50:07] the you got to step out on faith and
[50:09] seize the opportunity that God places in
[50:12] front of you and see God sends those
[50:14] warnings to get your attention
[50:16] all the things that may be happening in
[50:18] the world in life right now it may be
[50:20] just there to get your attention
[50:22] so why are these things happening
[50:24] because there's an opportunity presented
[50:26] before you and God is trying to warn you
[50:28] to take the right path God is trying to
[50:31] get your attention to say you need to do
[50:33] the right thing and I've given you the
[50:35] opportunity but what will you do with it
[50:37] and see as you go on he said by the
[50:40] chief priests and the elders persuaded
[50:42] the multitude that they should ask for
[50:44] rabbits and Destroy Jesus Jesus see
[50:47] there were some people that was
[50:49] persuading them and many of times you
[50:51] may have influences around you that's
[50:53] trying to persuade you to change the
[50:55] wrong opportunity that's trying to
[50:57] persuade you to go the wrong path and
[51:00] trying to influence you and make you
[51:02] choose the wrong direction but what are
[51:04] you going to do what are you going to do
[51:06] are you going to seize the right
[51:07] opportunity are you are you just going
[51:09] to go with the flow you're just going to
[51:11] go with everyone because they're
[51:12] persuading you to choose the wrong thing
[51:17] and the governor answered and said unto
[51:19] them whether the twain will ye that I
[51:22] release
[51:23] unto you and they said Barabbas and
[51:26] pilate said unto you what shall I do
[51:28] then with Jesus which is called Christ
[51:30] and they said unto him let him be
[51:33] crucified see Potter came to the pivotal
[51:36] moment where he could have chose
[51:38] something different
[51:40] but he asked him excuse me he asked them
[51:43] what will I do what will I do with the
[51:46] opportunity and they said let us crucify
[51:48] him and the governor said why what evil
[51:51] has he done but they cried out the more
[51:54] sin let him be crucified when pilate saw
[51:57] that he could know of it could Prevail
[52:00] nothing but that rather tumult was made
[52:03] he took water and washed his hands
[52:05] before the multitude saying I am
[52:07] innocent of the blood of this just
[52:09] person c e to it see pilate he chose an
[52:12] alternative route but he had the power
[52:14] to let him go
[52:16] he had the power to say you know what
[52:17] you're a free man because he had that
[52:19] Authority and that power in that moment
[52:23] to do something great but he he took a
[52:26] different opportunity he said I'd rather
[52:28] not have nothing to do with this but he
[52:30] needed he needed Jesus because Jesus was
[52:34] the one that could forgive him of his
[52:35] sins amen see there was an opportunity
[52:38] for him to do something greater but he
[52:41] chose not to do it
[52:42] see there's so many things in the
[52:45] scripture to show you what you can do
[52:47] and how God can can manifest his ways in
[52:50] his life but see there was purpose in
[52:52] this opportunity see Jesus had to go to
[52:55] the Cross because there was a greater
[52:57] opportunity he had to go to the Cross he
[52:59] had to go and die for your sin not for
[53:02] many maybe not for some people that
[53:04] don't take the right opportunity but he
[53:06] did it for you and me he did it he shed
[53:08] his blood for you and me and he came to
[53:11] the cross and he died because there was
[53:13] a greater opportunity he wanted to give
[53:15] the whole world a chance to see him he
[53:18] wanted to give a whole world a chance to
[53:20] reap eternal life but see you have to
[53:23] choose the right opportunity to get
[53:24] there you have to make the conscious
[53:27] decision and Lord I want to surrender my
[53:29] life to you but what I want to give you
[53:31] my heart I want to give you my life Lord
[53:33] I want you to use Me For Your Glory see
[53:36] that's the opportunity that you want to
[53:38] give and that's the opportunity that's
[53:39] presented before you this morning but
[53:42] what choices are you making are you
[53:44] making the right decision are you making
[53:46] the right choice are you seizing the
[53:48] right opportunities in your life are you
[53:51] stepping forward and say Lord that's
[53:52] what I want you to do in my life are you
[53:55] seizing it sometimes you have to step
[53:57] out and go against the grain that's what
[53:59] season the opportunity is about you have
[54:02] to step out you have to put forth some
[54:04] effort you got to do something different
[54:06] than everyone else that's around you
[54:09] see that seizing the opportunity that's
[54:11] not just gone because it's there you
[54:14] seize it you got to step out you got to
[54:16] do something you got to do something
[54:18] that's different you got to seize the
[54:20] opportunity see Jesus always knew what
[54:23] was going to happen he always knew that
[54:26] this was a greater opportunity this was
[54:29] a greater opportunity than what was set
[54:30] before and see he even said that after
[54:33] I'm gone I will leave my spirit that he
[54:36] may lead and guide you
[54:39] see God sent these these moments and you
[54:43] have to seize the opportunity you have
[54:45] to seize the opportunity to not just be
[54:48] there but Lord I want to be more I want
[54:50] to do more Lord I want to be used by you
[54:53] Lord I want you to take my life and Lord
[54:56] I want you to leave me in the right
[54:57] direction Lord I want to labor for you
[55:00] Lord that you may do something you may
[55:02] do a work in my life that that not only
[55:05] does my words testify but my life does
[55:07] as well not only what I do and then what
[55:10] I say but Lord also when people see me
[55:13] they know that that you are working
[55:15] through me they know that you are that
[55:17] you're doing a work in my life sometimes
[55:20] the greatest testimony that you can have
[55:22] is your life
[55:24] you can say many things but people will
[55:26] always watch and look how you live
[55:29] you may say the Lord Jesus is the Lord
[55:31] and savior of my life but how is your
[55:33] life living how are you living your life
[55:35] people knew that Jesus was a Healer
[55:38] because of the works that he did people
[55:40] knew that Jesus was a savior because he
[55:42] saved so many see they knew because of
[55:45] his life his life testified of who he
[55:48] was his life testified of who he was so
[55:52] so if you're a Christian does your life
[55:54] testify of it see that's the opportunity
[55:57] that you have today that you may profess
[56:00] him and that you may repent of your sins
[56:02] and that you may be baptized and you
[56:04] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[56:05] that's what the Bible says
[56:08] it's a promise given to you but are you
[56:11] seizing the promises of God are you
[56:13] seizing the opportunities and all the
[56:16] blessings that God has in store for you
[56:18] or are you just letting those Pastor by
[56:20] and said the opportunity Is Not Great
[56:22] enough for me that opportunity is not
[56:25] worth for me I said when will an
[56:27] opportunity be great enough for you to
[56:30] take it or to take a risk on it
[56:33] some people say you know what I'm not
[56:35] going to risk it because I'm stable I
[56:37] seem to be stable but just know that all
[56:40] it takes is one bump in the road to rock
[56:42] your ship all it takes is one small
[56:45] little Iceberg to rock your ship and
[56:47] you're sinking one of the greatest ships
[56:49] of all time that was built they called
[56:51] it Titanic
[56:52] and and they built this huge ship and
[56:55] then one day they're out on the ocean
[56:57] and they see the small Iceberg and they
[57:00] say you know what we gonna pass because
[57:03] we're so great and we're so mighty we're
[57:05] so we're so great and that this ship can
[57:08] go through anything we built it it's
[57:10] it's the most amazing ship that we had
[57:11] built at the time and so they took this
[57:14] and they said they had the opportunity
[57:16] to maybe go a different direction or to
[57:18] go around but they said we're not going
[57:20] to worry about that
[57:21] we're not going to worry about that but
[57:24] they didn't realize once they hit that
[57:25] Iceberg it was gonna sink their
[57:29] it was going to sink their ship and they
[57:31] were going to lose so many hundreds of
[57:32] and out maybe thousands of lives because
[57:35] they didn't take the right opportunity
[57:38] they didn't choose the right direction
[57:40] to go they went away that they they
[57:42] thought that looked good at the time
[57:44] when they started out their Journey but
[57:47] they didn't see the troubles in the
[57:48] trials and tribulations that was coming
[57:50] down the road they didn't see the the
[57:52] things but they took an opportunity and
[57:55] what looked nice and plain and good when
[57:57] they first started see they didn't seize
[57:59] the right opportunity they didn't take
[58:02] it see this a great opportunity that set
[58:04] before you
[58:12] I said if someone was to offer you today
[58:16] a hundred dollars
[58:18] and they say all you had to do was take
[58:20] it would you take it
[58:27] how many would take you
[58:30] how many would take it let me see
[58:33] I see some people that wouldn't take it
[58:34] Lord have mercy
[58:36] Lord have mercy do does it have to be
[58:38] greater for you to take it
[58:40] and someone had five hundred dollars
[58:41] would you take it
[58:46] let me see a thousand anybody okay now
[58:49] we're getting more consensus this
[58:51] morning see that's what that's what
[58:53] somebody would take a hundred dollars
[58:56] but it was there and it was free
[58:58] somebody said you know what I want
[59:00] better but what's what's the best thing
[59:03] that you can have if you can't have
[59:05] eternal life
[59:07] is there anything greater than your soul
[59:11] is there anything worth more than your
[59:12] soul this morning
[59:14] there's no money in the world that can
[59:17] count for your soul all the money if you
[59:19] had Elon Musk money it wouldn't even
[59:21] count for the greatest riches that are
[59:23] in heaven
[59:24] there's nothing that can compare to the
[59:27] beauty that shall be desired in him
[59:28] there's nothing that you can give that's
[59:30] worth more than reaching and then having
[59:33] eternal life
[59:34] but are you seizing the opportunity for
[59:36] eternal life
[59:38] are you seizing that opportunity to
[59:39] accept before you this morning
[59:42] because you have the opportunity to have
[59:44] eternal life you have the opportunity to
[59:47] come to Jesus and say Lord I Thank you
[59:49] for Dying For Me Lord I know that when
[59:51] you went to Calvary you shed your blood
[59:53] for me you didn't mind not you shed your
[59:56] blood for everyone but Lord I want to
[59:58] seize the opportunity and take that
[1:00:00] opportunity to say Lord thank you for
[1:00:02] saving for sharing your blood for me and
[1:00:04] Lord I accept and Lord I ask for
[1:00:06] forgiveness for my sins that's what
[1:00:09] seasonal opportunity is all about is

[1:00:13] this opportunity the Lord to give you my
[1:00:16] life the Lord set myself apart so that
[1:00:20] Lord you may use me
[1:00:22] that you may gain all the glory and all

[1:00:35] come to those moments that God gives you
[1:00:36] the opportunity for salvation God gives
[1:00:39] you the opportunity for rededication God

[1:00:48] do better than I'm doing today Lord I
[1:00:51] can give you more than I'm getting than
[1:00:52] I gave you yesterday Lord I can I can
[1:00:55] lean down and I can give you a greater
[1:00:57] sacrifice even if my sacrifices Just
[1:00:59] Praise even if my sacrifice is just
[1:01:02] prayer Lord even if my sacrifice is Lord
[1:01:04] just telling somebody about you I can
[1:01:07] give you a greater sacrifice because
[1:01:09] Lord you gave me a great opportunity you
[1:01:12] gave me a great moment and you gave me
[1:01:13] another day the Lord give you the glory

[1:01:18] day that the Lord has made and I will
[1:01:20] rejoice and be glad in it see there's
[1:01:22] great opportunity this morning Lord I
[1:01:24] can always come to you and give you more
[1:01:26] Lord David said if I had ten thousand
[1:01:29] tongues I couldn't praise you enough
[1:01:31] because of all the things that he has
[1:01:33] done for you even in the scene and
[1:01:35] unseen God is always there God is always
[1:01:38] watching and he always cares see that's
[1:01:41] the God that I serve and he's given you
[1:01:43] an opportunity to do the right thing
[1:01:45] each and every day he gives you the
[1:01:47] choice
[1:01:48] each and every moment he gives you the
[1:01:50] choice and say and see that's what I
[1:01:53] want you to understand this morning that
[1:01:55] God gives you the opportunity to do
[1:01:57] something great God gives you the
[1:01:59] opportunity to make the right choice God
[1:02:02] gives you the opportunity to say that
[1:02:04] you can make the best decision that
[1:02:06] you've ever made I've never seen God do
[1:02:08] anyone wrong I never seen God take
[1:02:11] advantage of anybody I've seen men do it
[1:02:13] but I've never seen God do it and see
[1:02:16] God is the one that said if you all ye
[1:02:18] that are heavy ladies and I will give
[1:02:20] you rest
[1:02:21] see that's the God that I serve he said
[1:02:24] take your burdens to the Lord and leave
[1:02:26] them there he can carry every weight he
[1:02:29] can carry every burden and he knows
[1:02:31] everything that you have done and he
[1:02:34] said I have come I have come and I've
[1:02:36] Shed My Blood I took those stripes and I
[1:02:39] took those took those whips and not and
[1:02:41] I and I did that so that you may have
[1:02:44] eternal life
[1:02:45] so that you have an advocate with the
[1:02:47] father when God looks at you he doesn't
[1:02:50] see what you've done he sees the blood
[1:02:52] sees that God has come and he's and he
[1:02:55] sacrificed himself and he shed it so
[1:02:57] that you and I may get eternal life and
[1:03:00] we may come and the Lord said I that he
[1:03:03] may say Well done not good and faithful
[1:03:05] servant enter into my rest see that's
[1:03:08] what I want to hear because you take it
[1:03:10] and you see it's the right opportunity
[1:03:12] and I want that for each and every one
[1:03:14] this morning amen see that God has given
[1:03:17] you the opportunity to do the right
[1:03:19] thing God has given you the opportunity
[1:03:21] to say come to me and and I I will give
[1:03:24] you forgiveness for your sins I will
[1:03:26] give you the I will give you a greater
[1:03:28] path and a greater purpose for your life
[1:03:31] I will show you all things and teach you
[1:03:33] all things because that's the God that I
[1:03:36] serve but what if
[1:03:41] I said now be real honest what if this
[1:03:45] was your last opportunity

[1:03:50] last opportunity

[1:03:54] would you take this if this was your
[1:03:56] last opportunity and you knew that you
[1:03:58] weren't going to get another
[1:04:01] would you take the opportunity to accept
[1:04:03] before you this morning

[1:04:09] your last opportunity may be
[1:04:11] no man knows the day or the hour when

[1:04:15] say this is the your moment is up your
[1:04:19] time and spend in life is gone
[1:04:22] and you look at it and say did I waste
[1:04:24] my opportunities

[1:04:28] gave me and the chances that he gave me
[1:04:33] or did I seize the opportunity when it
[1:04:36] was set before me
