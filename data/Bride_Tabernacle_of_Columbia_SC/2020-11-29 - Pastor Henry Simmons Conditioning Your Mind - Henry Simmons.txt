to you now we love you we appreciate you we thank you for all things God we commit this service in the word of Grace in your hand may you say the things you want said and do the things you want done in Jesus name we pray amen the book of 2 Thessalonians 2 we believe that in this age the mind is being conditioned the prophet of God talks about we must get in the spirit of Sodom before the world could really burn okay we having a little problem must get in the spirit of it and I'm saying condition in the mind and when we condition our minds often times we talk about condition our bodies if you're going to run a marathon or if you're going to play a sports you got to get in condition because you want to be able to finish your Endeavor okay so as we think about the physical condition how about the mental condition here 2 Thessalonians 2 now we besee you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind watch it the coming of the Lord but he said don't be soon shaken in mine because your mind can start shaking are you with me don't let the conditions shake you up or be trouble or be trouble neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand that was over 2,000 years ago but I believe is it it is at hand let no man deceive you by what by any means for that day shall not come except what are you witnessing that sir that come of Falling Away first might be more people going to church but they're falling away from what the truth [Music] amen Falling Away first [Music] amen and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition we have the man of sin the son of preditions will we find many are going to follow their pricious ways many are going to be trapped in the snare of the devil who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called God all that is worshiped so that he as God set in the temple of God showing himself that he is what he's God you may be seated God bless to reading his word the devil going to set in the temple of God remember your body is what the Temple of the Holy Ghost the devil was set in the temple of God and he would say that he is God just in the mindset of many folk many folks in their mind think that they could be devilish Central sinful and actually are so deceived that they still think that they're Christians they can commit adultery fornicate they can you know men with men women with women all kind of sins and they still think I'm a Christian why because something is in the temple of God showing themselves that he is God and he wants to be worshiped are you with me so it's a spirit Spirit that's on the throne of their soul that actually wants worship so instead of worshiping the true and living God they are so deceived that they come to church thinking that they worshiping Jesus and that they're worshiping God but because they did not learn the love of the truth God shall give them strong delusion are you with me so we're in the condition of the mind I'm the devil is setting the whole world up the world is being set up and brother and sister if God does not give you wisdom he said here's the mind that has wisdom let him that has the understanding so that that day should not catch you as a thief are you with me the world is being set up the world is being conditioned what are they getting in condition for this these spirits of deception the Antichrist spirit that was working in the first age was setting itself up for the Antichrist himself are you with me so the Antichrist sent spirits that went forth before him to get the world in condition for that man of sin are you with me so the spirits go out to condition their minds and get the people ready for to receive the man of sin so people the prophet of God talks about thirst and he talks about what we're thirsting as David said my soul thirst is for the Living God he was thirsting for God my soul thirth for the Living God he said as the heart painted after the water book amen so my soul thirsteth for the Living God now David realized that as the body the Natural Body needed water and there was a thirst that was in his jar in the natural for water you don't drink any water and for a period of time then you realize that if the body does not get water then you begin to thirst you begin to desire thirst for it and then that voice is like an alarm that thirst is like an alarm it get louder and louder but if you refuse to give the body water what happens brother sister that thirst get lighter oh I need water said well I'm not going to give you no water what happens you what you going to do more than that huh you're going to die is't that right you can have a thirst for food isn't that right and if you get hungry hungry hungry and if you don't never eat what happens you die you get so hungry you can get cramps in your stomach you started gring want some food ain't that right but if you don't eat something as the natural body cannot survive without food the natur few food Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Jesus told a woman if you drink the water that I give you you'll never never thirst again are you with me so as it is on natural desire to live with we need water we need bread amen then we need for our soul to live it needs the spirit of God it needs the word of God if you fail Amen to give amen spiritual drink and spiritual bread if you don't amen feed your your [Music] souls are you with me now brothers and sister the natural man in the natural mind it don't care for the things of God the soul down deep you can tell who's on the throne of your heart who who is really there in your heart who's sitting on the throne is where you desarge are that's simple brother and sister what are you Desiring are you Desiring the things of the world all you work and all you labor for is a house and a car and pretty clothes and nice outfits is that's all amen where where's your desire H Better Learning or whatever what's your desires what are what do you Desiring for your what is The Thirst what what is your craving about what do you really want in life what are you what is your desire he said my soul thirsts for the Living God I need God I I want God what about you brother and sister are your thirst for the world some folks thirst for friendship some folks St thirst for a companion but I heard the word said seek first the kingdom of God and all these things I add if you need a father I believe that Jesus will be a father if you need a mother I believe that Jesus would be a mother if you need a husband I believe Jesus will be a husband if you need a wife I believe he'll be a wife whatever you need I believe that God is able to supply it for he promised but my God shall supply all of your needs according to his riches and Glory Oh Glory got a lot of riches isn't that right I said Glory has a lot of riches amen you ought to understand that his riches in glory amen that's your riches and Glory supplies all your needs are you with me for one day with the Lord is amen oh as a thousand years so I'm saying your riches in glory shall supply all of your needs tell somebody next to you your riches in glory shall supply all of your needs are you with me see amen we don't realize amen the glory of the Lord should be our habitation our a dwelling place and there must be abundancy amen of blessings in amen uh in in Christ because being in Christ is to be partakers of his glory Divine and that Glory Divine amen brings us into the end of veil what you're talking my brothers and sisters I'm talking about when God fills you with his glory baptizes you with the spirit oh God it it lifts you up Amen in Heavenly places it takes you beyond your human understanding and your human needs amen you forget about this world because God has given you a better world Amen you forget about your desires because God has given you amen Heavenly things your affections on things above am are you up me praise God and if if God desire amen while you in heaven in the places Amen to give you a companion or whatever oh thank you Lord because that's not my main emphasis that's not my main goal my main goal is I want you amen if I don't have amen uh things of this life but amen amen that's why the songwriter says you may have the whole wi world but give me Jesus oh yes he said what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul brother and sister that's reality brother that's reality sister amen what what prophet us say Amen to have everything to have a a 100 million in the bank and amen living in uh luxury in this life and Lose My Soul what would it profit me brother amen what would it profit me if I can go out and I can drive uh a $100,000 car live in a million doll house and what profit if I have all of that and Lose My Soul are you with me brother and sister I believe the devil has Hood wank a lot of folk because he's captured their minds and they are Earthly minded they're so caught up with the Earthly things and the things of this world that the things of God does not resumate with them the things of God does not have preeminence in their lives amen people are selling out because the devil amen as the prophet of God said watch where your desires is and I'll tell you whether or not you got the holy ghost or [Music] not oh yes we desire to go here to do that no we desire all kind of things but are you Desiring that God used Me For Your Glory help me to get a soul to Christ I while I'm here on this Earth Lord help me to be a light to the world help me to shine that somebody can see Jesus that somebody would get to know the love of God because you love me so and I love you back I want everybody to have this love that you've given me I want everybody to know the Jesus that I know I want everybody to experience the joy that I have all the peace that I have nothing in this world will I exchange it for Amen brother and sister if you have not come in contact amen with Jesus Christ in a real genuine way amen then I said brothers and sisters you ought to get on your knees and said God I need you amen at the heart Panic after the water Brook so my soul thirsted for the Living God God I need you now God come and help me now brother and sister don't let this moment pass you by don't let the opportunity amen that you have to serve the Living [Music] God let me finish Thessalonians I just gave a Prelude here we are in this moment brother and sister in this [Music] hour all kind of things are [Music] happening the fifth verse says remember ye not when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity iniquity is when you know better and you don't know no and you don't do no better you know how you supposed to live you know how you supposed to walk the mystery of iniquity that a demon Spirit that's hiding in the inside and you got to want that devil out to if your desires is not for the things of God then there a Wicked spirit what makes a man want to commit adultery fornicating look at pornography that's a wicked demon what makes a young lady wants to show all of herself said I forgot my slip some say I want to show off my upper part what makes some want to do that what desires for them to be revealing and tempting men and amen knowing that the scripture said if a man look at a woman and lust after her she causes him to commit adultery what makes a woman want to make it has to be that woman that young girl that uh that uh mistress that uh maybe that ageable woman she has no desire to make a man go to hell but it's only because the weak pull pits the weak preachers in the pull pit don't tell them no better are you with me because when you know to do good and you don't do it it's sin but if nobody tell you you can and that's why it makes me so hump to feel for those people that amen they don't know and should I beat them over the head because the B Jesus said forgive them because what but you that know the truth should God forgive you because you don't know no better you know the better and you still do the same thing that they are doing they would do better if they knew better you know better it won't do no better are you with me there is a difference is't that right now God can say Mercy on them but should God said mercy on you I can see them coming before God and and they might have had on a whatever topless top but they didn't know no better but you Amen to hear the word and say you love Jesus and say you're a Christian ought to know better are you with me that will be no excuse for you in that day when Jesus returned there would be no excuse so brother and sister you're going to have to give account to God for your own self it's not what brother sister so and so was doing is what you did brother are you trying to stay in style with your tight Bridges pants excuse me where men can lust out to men lust after men and give some slack you might look oldfashioned but you in style with God are you with me I don't want to be in style with the world and go to hell for it amen the condition of the Mind the devil is taking everything that he can do the condition of mind that you can accept the what except the Antichrist except the mark of the beast are you with me he is actually getting you so hyped up that you don't even realize or know what Spirit has taking control of you sometimes the question is asked did you pray about it did you pray on that uh ah we don't want to pray and ask God is it all right the reason why we don't want to pray and ask God is it all right because we already know not to ask God nothing like that because we know it ain't right are you with me so why pray and ask God is it all right when you already know what God going to say you can hear that little still voice of the word that little still voice that's inside of a a True Believer a true Christian that desire to do the right thing to live the right way you can hear that little voice don't you do that you see that alarm going off why you go on and push it to the side go go go go go go Prophet said you run that voice off for the last time are you with me you keep on pushing God off to the side talking about well I saw some some some D it maybe they didn't hear the voice you heard well uh somebody say I look good maybe they didn't hear the voice you heard I don't see nothing wrong with it who you trying to convince who you talking to you talking to that voice that told you don't do it and you telling you that voice cuz it could be nobody around and you could be saying to yourself I don't see nothing wrong with it who you talking to you actually talking back to God and you telling God Amen because ain't nobody near you mama not near you Daddy not near you but it's a voice speaking to you telling you don't are you with me you didn't hear the preacher but the prophet of God said it'll be the voice of many Waters one day there'll be a multitude of voices of many Waters he said that'll be the preachers throughout the ages The Messengers throughout the ages that stay with the word the preachers say Amen you hear those voice of men and Waters that'll be the voice of judgment it'll be the voice of judgment one day brother sister you hear those voices they calling back to you and that's a voice of judgment when you stand before God you hear those voices I got to cut off I hadn't started but I love you this morning I want to see you make it in heaven I hope you want to go there I hope you want to go there with all your heart there's been a spirit to condition the minds of the people to receive the mark of the beast and it's captivating the minds of the whole world this virus is just a preview of what would cause the world to come on one Accord and worship the Antichrist the Beast are you with me there has been a system set up that the world could come on one Accords almost like overnight we can go from mask to mark from the MK to the mark of the beast let everybody put on a mask no man can work buy sell except he receed let's go to Revel just read that verse there before I close Revelation 13 I skipped over to Thessalonians but I'm going right there Revelation 13 16 and he calls it all right he calls it what Revelation 13:16 he calls it what all are you a part of all he said it causes what are you a part of all that all don't include me now are you with me he calls it all but it don't concl it don't conclude me are you with me I'm not a part of all how many times you say I everybody else all all I'm not a part of what all all can do what they want amen but I'm not a part of all amen he called all all got to wear a mask of receive $100 fine in the city of Columbia brother and sister condition your mind to receive theor getting you under the influence of to accept the vaccine the vaccination or whatever oh you saying that to Mark no no no no no I'm just saying you C I'm using this as a a little type are you with me of what can happen how quick it can happen how you can quickly subject yourself if you don't know what's going on to receive the mark of the beast because he said here's the mind that has wisdom let him that has understanding you that got wisdom will not be a part of all you that have understanding other than that you know we're not saying the mask we're not saying the vaccine I'm just giving you a scenario here and a little tipe let you understand that where we are how close we are to the more we are very very close and what the prophet saw a woman rise up perhaps so we got both of them vice president or president or perhaps the church are you with me y'all know what church I'm talking about are you with me so you got both of them coming up how close are we are to the six and then seven how close are we and what are we doing we are going on like nothing is transpiring nothing is happening because why your mind is being conditioned to receive the M you accept it as though it's something normal I'm not telling nobody oh don't re don't take the vaccine no no I'm not saying nothing about that but I'm just telling you amen you that is spiritual you that has understanding you got to know how late the hour is and where we are it's later than you think it is it's closer than you might think it is and you need to think about your own soul these fleshly things don't mean nothing right now you got a soul that you need to be concerned about God going to bless you with these other things but don't put them in front of God God going to give you the desires of your heart if you delight yourself in the Lord God going to bless you if you delight yourself in the Lord but don't get caught up just trying to be religious and trying to be a fake why take a counterfeit when you can have the real amen why take Satan when you can have Jesus are you with me brother and sister you got an opportunity to have the King of Kings and the Lord of lords why take this world when you can have heaven the grass wiggled the flowers faded but the word of the Lord shall stand forever brothers and sister that's a place amen praise God hallelujah oh as the prophet talk about the six uh mention and talked about the sublim that's there oh what about heaven what about going up into the seven the where God is are you with me don't miss the marriage Supple there an appointment amen the marriage supper of the Lamb when we'll be
