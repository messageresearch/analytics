morning for all that have pressed their way out here this morning Lord we pray that you would bless each and every heart bless your word anoint it give us what we need for the journey that we are in Jesus name we pray amen the book of Saint Luke as we stand for the reading of the word 25 through 36 I read the first you read the next 36 together amen I'm glad for charity Beth and brother George amen said men's hearts 21 and many hearts failing let me go 25 okay 25. okay it says and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring 26. and then shall they see the son of man cometh in the cloud with power and great Glory 28. and he spoke to them in the power of behold the Fig Tree and all the trees 30. so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is not at hand 32. Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away 34. for either snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth together what she therefore and pray always that ye may recounted worded to escape all these things that should come to pass and to stand before the son of man God bless you and George you may be seated amen then we want to go to Ephesians here 4 and 30. Ephesians 4 and 30. it says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye is sealed until the day of redemption and we were in between two thoughts your Redemption draweth nigh and seal until the day of redemption seal unto the day of redemption now I've been preaching a little about this the book of redemption the seven seal book the book was sealed with Seven Seals in Revelation 5. and that was the breach between the church agents and the seals the book of redemption amen sealed unto the day of redemption and we asked the question what does redemption means and we talked about the title deed the abstract title deed and what abstract meant it means that it's been such all the way back to its beginning and Redemption we were redeemed because we were dealing with the blood of Jesus and what it means to each and every one of us and it was because of the blood of Jesus Christ that will redeem because we've been we've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb are you with me so Redemption came through the blood amen and then we talked about the abstract kind of deed what it really Redemption really means that we have legal possession of all that was lost by Adam and Eve and as I was on my knees praying this morning and I said Lord in a legal possession for all that Adam and Eve lost we have it back we've been redeemed amen and because we have the abstract titled deed that went back in the hand of the original owner in the book of redemption now it's back in our hands are you with me so you have legal rights to all that Adam laws and I know if you had those legal rights it'll puff your head way up because if you don't know how to use it you abuse it are you with me see somebody gives you I was looking at you know most of the Millionaires and billionaires that you know it's hard to be humble so I thought about uh Philippians 2 and 5 Philippians 2 and 5. and that's why we have to deal with humility once we have uh achieved certain goals it takes a certain amount of humility not to be lifted up in Pride are you with me we can achieve very little things in our lives yet it's far beyond many of our equal and when you are able to achieve certain goals maybe you you you know you were in the ghetto or in the hood and you become a professor a doctor lawyer some uh maybe some distinguished person in life can you become that and still keep your humility and now not many people can deal with how to be humble once they have a reached certain goals and certain things in life particularly because uh they have an identity you know it was hard for Nebuchadnezzar when he had battle and look at what all this happened and God had to bring him down to his hair growled up his fingernails like the you know Eagles and you know it was he lost his mind begin to eat grass you know because God when God gives you something it's difficult uh uh to not be lifted up and and I and I said Lord the messages in which we've been preaching lately if you really receive them it could cause a certain amount of arrogancy and it can lift you off and you can walk with certain amount of pride if you really uh digested and you really uh it's really been revealed to you who you are and you've been redeemed I mean everything Adam lost it I have it now you mean to tell me everything has been restored back to me because I've been redeemed because of the blood of the Lamb see if you really knew who you were then you know what you possess but oftentimes we don't realize who we are to the full extent only we have pop uh uh partial revelation but we don't have the full revelation of who we are and what it means to be a son or daughter of God and because we don't we cannot express what we do not Envision and we do not understand so we don't understand the full impact of what it means to be a son or daughter of God then we'll never be able to use it but we might end up abusing it that's why he says in Ephesians 4 he said greed not the Holy Spirit or by you what sealed unto the day of redemption are you with me so God Amen it said after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall have isn't that right so the power that we have when we reach certain goals it gives us certain uh uh uh Authority and power you know you can you know you can go into certain places you can do certain things and you can walk in in into a car dealership and says well I I like to have this Mercedes or this Lexus because uh you know because you know how powerful your money is you can walk in a neighborhood and you can say well this house might cost uh 10 million it doesn't mean much to you when you you know you're a billionaire you know I I I I'll pay cash and I you know for it are you with me so when you realize the magnitude of Who You Are and I would suck my revelation of five and ten and he made us Kings and Priests and we shall what reign on Earth isn't that right so he's made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and as being Kings and Priests amen realizing amen who you are as a king and as a priest or you will be but amen who wants you know a lot of times folk want to be a doctor want to be a lawyer want to be a president want to be a congressman but who wants to be a you have the opportunity Amen to be a son or daughter of God which makes you above all of that amen so all the worldly achievements don't mean nothing compared to amen what God can make you not through amen the universities and the colleges in Yale lahava Cambridge or Oxford amen but I do amen praise God the baptism of the Holy Ghost and through receiving Jesus Christ as a Lord amen then God brings you into a place Amen to seal you until the day of redemption and your ceiling is the earnest of your inheritance it tells you that this is just a down payment on what God has in store for you amen oh praise God it's much more amen because you're in this circular body amen praise God you cannot fully understand the magnitude of the glory that shall be revealed in US are you with me so it's a glory amen that amen that God cannot fully express to you because your mind cannot comprehend it amen and your bodies cannot contain it are you with me so and that's why he said until the day of redemption amen okay I don't want to go too fast but you'll seal he says here in Philippians that's why I I thought about it I said that's why Jesus he knew who he was in in Ephesians uh two I mean Philippians 2 and 5 it says let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus are you with me that's why as a Christian he's telling you how to conduct yourself with all this Authority and all this power that I've given you I want you but let this mind be in you see it's something to humble yourself he says here who've been in the form of God thought it not what Robbie to be equal with God you see what I'm saying I want you to know who you are being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God because Jesus was it was God but because of this he says but being made excuse me daughter not but being made but made of him of no reputation took upon him the what the form of a servant was made in the likeness of what send men and being found in the fashion of a what a man he what see he said I got power to call 12 leads and Angels but he what I mean they couldn't kill him he said no man take my life huh and I got power what pick it up again that's why many times the prophet you know he told some of the Believers where to find some oil he said it's a big Golf Show and it's the main gosh is over there I think it's in Oklahoma somewhere he told him to go there and get it and they held back because he saw it in the vision he said why he didn't go get it himself all of that all he could have been a multi multi-billionaire you know what I'm saying but he saw in the vision he told him where it was and they didn't go get it you see what I'm saying and sometimes amen but he wasn't going to use God's gift to get rich are you with me some people use the ministry and the gift that God gave them to be rich God give you the gift of singing you're going to sing for money God give you the gift of speaking of preaching amen and you're going to preach for money are you with me God give you the gift of playing music you want to play for money you see what I'm saying but the prophet of God didn't use his gift to get rich and many people that all they have in their mind is riches as I told y'all on Friday night you know I've sat down with a brother that was a billionaire and people that was you know I had plenty of opportunities but at the same time you know what did that mean to me you got to know what God wants you to have see Jesus knew God's plan for his life he knew what amen he came to do in the preference was for him being born and because you don't understand your purpose then you might fall for any lie of the devil the devil can tell you amen won't you be this won't you be that you're going to be this and that and it wasn't it pleases God or not you don't even understand the plan of God for your life but many people because they don't understand the plans of God some of us live beneath the plan of God some of us try to live above the plan of God but we must understand God's perfect will for our lives Jesus himself said Lord not my will but your will be done and once we found out that God's purpose and God's Will and God's plan for our lives amen we will begin to a life will be much more simpler but life is very perplexed in very troubling when we don't really know God's purpose and plan for our lives and that's why and we try to achieve certain goals because this is amen this is what life is all about brother and sister uh I I I find Within Myself amen that I I I I I I I I I I I I I'm still amen not saying that I've already comprehended already apprehend but this one thing I do know as Paul said forgetting those things which are behind me amen and and I pressed towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God that's in Christ are you with me I Got Heaven on my mind but let me let me just tell you uh here and he says he humble themselves and they first uh uh uh humble himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross now who would think that that was God's plan for his son his only begotten son that God had a plan and that plan was for him to die are you with me and you know the uh the man that walked on water the man that told Lottery to come back from the dead after stinking for four days the man that in that praise God talked Spirit to the wind and the Sea and said peace be still but yet yet it looks like he's defeated yet God plan for his life was death but not for himself but for you and I not for anything with all the power and authority that he thought it not rivalry to be equal with God but made of himself with no reputation are you up there but you and I we want something men reputation that we want to be looked up to want to be somebody in society we want our heads and shoulders to walk that we've achieved and accomplished certain goals I said the greatest achievement of any one of us is to be a son or daughter of God praise God I said the billionaire wish that he could the millionaire cat I'm on it but I can't hide it amen but you and I have what the world cannot give us amen we have eternal life and it could not be project with blood you cannot achieve it with education amen you have to come to Humble way you have to come to the cross oh God and bowel your knees into the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord I need you praise God I need you because I know you have amen thoughts concerning me amen you have a plan for me praise God and I want your plan and I want your will to be done in my life praise God Amen when we can humble ourselves before the master and recognize that the master has a plan praise God hallelujah wait leaves may I follow God has he says humming himself to the death of the Cross wherefore God also has what Holly exhorted him if you want to be exalted amen God will highly exalt you I'm I'm just coming into visions of certain things you know sometimes we're afraid to walk we're afraid to receive what God gives us because we said I don't want it and some of us trying to get what God don't want us to have so we all are all baffled with some folk and we're struggling and we're having a hard time mind battles sickness in the body all kind of stuff happened to us because well we don't know what what we're kind of lost when amen we're in this world we will be trying to adjust to it and we don't know how to make adjustments I'm not talking about you I'm talking about myself also and not Lord the Lord is simplifying everything is coming so simple now and in this Simplicity of of God now God wants to simplify life for you he wants to take the pressure off of life because amen sometimes you know sometimes as a Christian we just don't know but the seals have been taken off the book are you let me I know I I got I got some scriptures to go through and I I I'm trying to make it short because I guess I've been preaching for 20-30 minutes lately but let me just look at Romans 8. he humbled himself it's something to walk humble I'm talking about Redemption you're sealed into the day of redemption praise God Romans 8. here talks about 8 and 14. it says as many as of what led by the spirit of God there I was I want to preach but I can't if I do it then I'm gonna mess up I'll mess it up I want you but I want you to see it amen see without the Holy Ghost you're not going to be led by the spirit of God but as many as a led by the spirit of God they are the one sons of God now God has made you and I amen Kings and Priests and you must be led by the spirit of God to be a son of God see the spirit of this world Amen it's going to try to please the flesh but the spirit of God is going to please God are you with me and a lot of times we please our flesh because we amen are not led by the spirit of God and because we're not led by the spirit of God we're getting a lot of trouble a lot of headaches a lot of pain a lot of stuff we go through is because we're led by our own spirit the trouble that we get in a lot of sickness and afflictions come on our bodies and in mental battles and all kind of things because we're not subject the Bible said he thought it not Robert you'll be given God but he made of himself and no repetition and harm on himself the servant and found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself it's hard to see if we can get a people to walk in humility we can get a people that's going to be blessed people but we cannot we can man it's uh it's hard to be humble amen and to know amen that oh Hallelujah without god with nothing amen somebody said we like a ship without a sail without him I can do nothing okay so let me he says the 15th verse ye have not received the spirit of what and that's what I was talking about the the Redemption means that you're no more bound to sin until the things of this world because everything in this world will bring you into bondage amen so you don't want to be abound all this in the world is what lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the what proud of this life we're not bound by these things let us not uh subject ourselves he made us Kings rulers we uh and you should Reign on Earth praise God you above that I'm not saying that we should not get our degrees in college I'm not saying that you amen God gives you the ability to give to achieve great things in life thank God for that but that's not you you know that's nothing because what God has given is far beyond all of this stuff so I'm not gonna let this stuff bring me into bondage but we realize that amen that's all the world have and that's why they're in bondage to it because that's all they got are you with me but God has given us far beyond that okay he says you receive the spirit of bondage again to fear so what I'm what I'm saying we don't fear I might lose my job uh uh I might lose my money you know what I'm saying I you know I lose your job lose your money you know what I'm saying fear of these things losing it amen we we we are afraid to lose our house and lose our call to lose our job are free did not job said the Lord give it and if the Lord take it away he said what blessed be the name it's not I'm not gonna lose my soul he said because I know my what I know my redeemer lives let's see what I'm saying I'm talking about uh until the day of redemption I I I I steam him far beyond anything that this world has to offer I'm going to maintain my Integrity I'm a hold of God's unchanging hands amen it doesn't matter what comes amen it doesn't matter what I achieve or what I don't have remember my love for him is more precious than gold I love him in spite of they didn't know what I have or what I don't have thank God for all He blesses us with amen and God wants to bless some of us beyond measure but he just wants you to get get you in the right place where he can bless you praise the god I hadn't you know you've been trying to bless yourself but God want to bless you if you're beyond yourself I want you to recognize that the blessings of God make it rich and adding no sorrow are you up man so God want to bless you in a in an abundant way amen but you so busy trying to bless yourself are you with me and you can't get what God got for you because you're trying to get it yourself amen the grace of God you can't get it and salvation you can't work for it and get it we'll save by faith through Grace amen not it works because if you had to work for your post amen and the blessings of God that he gives to you is not how hard you work to get it it's not how intelligent you are amen God the blessings of the Lord all good and perfect gifts are you with me and God Amen God want to give you certain things but he can't give it to you because you're gonna boast and brag as though you've achieved it look at that God even is not your achievement no more praise God you can walk on that job knowing that God put you there praise God God gave it to you brother God amen and when God give it to you can walk with your head up and not have to fear praise God you're walking with authority the supervisor ain't got that Authority goes over you ain't got that Authority but God bless you oh yeah are you with me so you realize where your help come from amen you realize who gave you what you got praise God the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away are you up man so what God does for us now God wants to take us some places and do some things in our lives and for us amen that amen beyond your fondness imagination amen God want to take your places and bless you in such a way that you can't even imagine how it's going to be done so don't try to figure it out just let God will be done don't try to you know help God you can't help him God can open doors and no man can shout and shut down that no man can open praise God hallelujah God got things that he wants to give his sons and daughters amen and you know it's God is no it's not you are you with me not the spirit of bondage the things of the world that you try to achieve it brings you into bondage because you think you've accomplished you know but when God blessed you it's no bondage with it it's free freely you have received freely give him not the spirit of bondage he but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry I have a father God is your father and my God is rich and housing and land he holds the wealth of the world in his hand are you moving I'm gonna tell you something I want to know that's been afraid to get some of the things that God wanted to give me I just I don't want it I can't handle it but you know I've come to the place that hey let me stop all of this and some of us are just like me God want to bless you and give you this and oh I like this you know house you might like the house you're living in the neighborhood you're living in and you might like the people next door neighbor and all and you satisfy God into this contentment it's great game and that is true that don't mean that God that you have to stay when God wants to elevate you are you up see when God wants to elevate you it's not you elevating yourself as God elevating you and when God blesses you it's not you blessing yourself is God blessing you it's not that even you asked for and you wanted it this God give it to you are you with me so nothing wrong because amen it's not gonna make it on you're sad and uh depressed and worry about if I lose it God gave it to you anyway are you with me when God gave it to you amen praise God if you lose it and he said oh Lord you know look God blessed be the name of the Lord are you with me but if you work so hard and all man all my life I did this and I got this and that uh no God gives it to you so you thank the Lord every day as long as you give God the praise I got I got to close I've been too long but I'm trying to get here but let me just try to you said the 16 verses Spirit itself bad Witness with our spirit that we are the what children of God and if children then we are what is amen you know a lot of times when we don't want to hear property because it don't take but one person in that a whole lot everything one person to jump up and said this is mine y'all ain't gonna have nothing so you know air property you know sometimes you have a lot of fight a lot of struggle with ears amen but the Bible says your ears of who now y'all know who God is he said you are children [Music] if your children in your ears of who do you know who God is and what then he says and what Johnny is with what then then you know we say all that God was he quoted into Christ and all that Christ will he pulled it into the Church isn't that right and if that be the case then what out of me lost it's yours are you with me cause you've been redeemed how can
