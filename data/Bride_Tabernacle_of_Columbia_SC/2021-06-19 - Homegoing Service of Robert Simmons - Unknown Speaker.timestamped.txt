[39:50] they should stumble and fall
[39:54] their hosts should i camp against me
[39:59] my heart should not feel
[40:02] the walls shall rise against me
[40:07] and this will i become of them
[40:11] one thing have i desired of the lord

[40:24] or the days of my life
[40:27] to behold the beauty of the lord
[40:31] and to inquire in his temple
[40:35] for in a time of trouble
[40:38] he should hide me in his provision
[40:42] and the secret of his tabernacle should
[40:45] he hide me
[40:47] he should set me upon a rock
[40:52] and now should my head be lifted

[41:54] read first corinthians
[41:56] the 15th chapter 51st
[41:59] verse down through 58th
[42:03] verse and it read thusly behold
[42:06] i show you a mystery we shall not all
[42:09] sleep but we shall all be changed
[42:13] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[42:16] at the last trump for this

[42:27] and we shall be changed for this
[42:29] corruptable must put on in corruption
[42:32] and this mortal must put on m
[42:36] mortality so when this
[42:39] corruptible shall have put on in
[42:41] corruption
[42:42] and this mortal have put on immortality
[42:47] then shall be bought to pass the saying
[42:51] that is written death is swallowed up in

[42:55] oh death where's thy sting o grave
[42:59] where is thy victory the sting of death

[1:00:05] robert
[1:00:06] robert was a great ex he
[1:00:10] he showed us so much love
[1:00:13] i never had to worry about in school my
[1:00:16] brother
[1:00:17] always looked out for me he's
[1:00:20] always when he come to the house he
[1:00:22] always had words of encouragement
[1:00:25] he he had a great speak of knowledge of
[1:00:29] the world and what's going on around us
[1:00:31] he could always give us good advice
[1:00:35] even when it came to dressing he was
[1:00:38] always
[1:00:38] we used to call him the number one
[1:00:40] dressers in the world he was the number
[1:00:41] one dress they did church he still did
[1:00:43] the same thing
[1:00:45] when he my brother went to vietnam
[1:00:48] my mother had called me and said
[1:00:50] robert's bringing some friends to the
[1:00:51] house
[1:00:52] could you fry some chicken and make some
[1:00:54] potato salad
[1:00:56] for the um the means that was coming and
[1:00:59] i'm thinking there's just a few meals
[1:01:01] coming in
[1:01:02] and he almost bought his whole company
[1:01:04] to the house
[1:01:05] and i thought i'd never get through
[1:01:06] cutting up chicken and frying chicken
[1:01:08] that day but
[1:01:09] i was glad i did it because most of
[1:01:11] those guys that
[1:01:13] came to eat they didn't make it back
[1:01:17] and that was probably their last
[1:01:19] home-cooked meal
[1:01:21] and i thank god they gave me strength to
[1:01:23] do it for them
[1:01:24] and and i'm so thankful for everything
[1:01:29] that he has done for the family he tried
[1:01:31] to help the family in so many ways
[1:01:34] he tried to teach them how to make money
[1:01:37] he tried to
[1:01:38] exhort the family to have their own
[1:01:40] business he even tried to open up a
[1:01:42] restaurant for the family but everybody
[1:01:44] was on their jobs and nobody wanted to
[1:01:46] come
[1:01:46] to something even though we were great
[1:01:48] cooks and things
[1:01:50] but we think uh but nobody had the faith
[1:01:54] and didn't know that they could have
[1:01:56] just stepped out on faith
[1:01:58] you know but he my brother had the faith
[1:02:01] and he never lost the faith it to the
[1:02:04] end
[1:02:05] even though he went through pain and
[1:02:06] suffering he never complained
[1:02:10] when he came home we all
[1:02:13] my mother and she would always try to
[1:02:15] have him whatever he liked
[1:02:17] and his wife would tell me to make her
[1:02:19] upside down pineapple cake and i would
[1:02:21] always have it ready for her when she
[1:02:23] get there
[1:02:25] i mean he showed us so much love
[1:02:28] and he all he wanted was for his family
[1:02:32] to be together and to show love to one
[1:02:34] another
[1:02:35] he was all about nothing but love for
[1:02:38] everybody
[1:02:39] even the people in the world he tried to
[1:02:42] help everybody he came in contact with
[1:02:45] he didn't even want to take a dime from
[1:02:46] the church when
[1:02:48] even though he was the pastor he gave it
[1:02:50] all back to them
[1:02:51] to the church he he was this type of
[1:02:54] person this is the type of man
[1:02:56] robert was he went to vietnam and at
[1:02:59] vietnam
[1:03:00] i remember passing so many days and
[1:03:03] praying that
[1:03:04] that my brother make it back home safe
[1:03:07] and thank god
[1:03:08] i saw him a couple of times when one
[1:03:11] time he was the only one left
[1:03:14] and the second time it was just two of
[1:03:16] them left
[1:03:18] my brother went through a lot of things
[1:03:19] but he never discussed vietnam to me
[1:03:22] and and i talked to one of the guys that
[1:03:25] was in vietnam
[1:03:27] and he he told me the same thing as i
[1:03:29] seen in my dream
[1:03:30] that that happened to my brother and but
[1:03:33] you know even though
[1:03:34] he saw all the death around him he
[1:03:37] showed us
[1:03:38] nothing but he came back and he always
[1:03:40] had a spouse he had always had words of
[1:03:42] encouragement at all times

[1:06:42] this way i was at when
[1:06:46] me and pastor simmons rose crossed
[1:06:52] he became my mentor he he became the one
[1:06:55] that
[1:06:56] stood in the gap when i didn't have a
[1:06:59] father
[1:07:00] a spiritual father one that could lead
[1:07:03] me to christ
[1:07:04] i had many role models but those role
[1:07:07] models i had was
[1:07:09] strung out on drugs
[1:07:12] marijuana alcohol
[1:07:16] women see but that role model didn't
[1:07:21] wasn't going nowhere and if i look at
[1:07:25] some of my friends today
[1:07:26] those role models they still ain't going
[1:07:30] nowhere
[1:07:32] but pastor simmons
[1:07:35] through god changed my direction in life
[1:07:41] so i thank him for all that he have done
[1:07:45] for me
[1:07:47] it was over 40 years uh i met pastor
[1:07:51] simmons
[1:07:52] i was around 16 17 years old
[1:07:56] and he stepped into my life not just
[1:07:58] pastor simmons but
[1:08:00] his wife mother simmons and and the
[1:08:02] children they
[1:08:03] adopted me like i was their own brother
[1:08:06] and sister
[1:08:08] and i appreciate this family
[1:08:12] i appreciate them i grew up
[1:08:15] with this family yeah pastor simmons
[1:08:18] became a father
[1:08:22] he spent many hours personally
[1:08:25] with me
[1:08:29] road trips i can remember when i joined
[1:08:32] the military
[1:08:33] it was pastor simmons and his family
[1:08:35] would take me all the way back from
[1:08:37] sumter to virginia
[1:08:40] uh just to get me back
[1:08:43] when my money got short it was pastor
[1:08:45] simmons
[1:08:48] put a little dollars in my pocket get
[1:08:51] back to the base
[1:08:53] because he preached so hard i had to
[1:08:54] give up all my money
[1:09:00] i say pastor now i ain't got no money to
[1:09:04] get back to the base
[1:09:08] he'd been good to me his family been

[1:09:27] season
[1:09:29] you know he was a resilient preacher
[1:09:33] he never would stay down and one thing
[1:09:36] he taught me was
[1:09:38] hold your head up square your shoulders
[1:09:43] be a man
[1:09:46] that's what he taught me don't
[1:09:50] fear nobody
[1:09:54] he said man is grass
[1:09:57] the grass withered the flowers fade away
[1:10:02] so it is with man so he taught me to be
[1:10:06] a man to love my family
[1:10:10] to love god to fast and to pray
[1:10:15] he taught me how to minister he he
[1:10:17] taught me how to witness

[1:28:01] came to rejoice
[1:28:04] i'm not here to come sit here and and
[1:28:06] tear up and
[1:28:07] and well up and cry that time is going
[1:28:11] to come but today
[1:28:12] right now this moment i'm gonna give god
[1:28:15] some praise i don't know about you

[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:19] so so first it's a sad frog that can't
[1:29:21] praise his own pond
[1:29:23] so i'm going to begin with i thank god
[1:29:26] for
[1:29:26] being the head of so many of our lives
[1:29:29] um
[1:29:29] and ahead of my life as well but i i do
[1:29:32] want to send a shout out y'all
[1:29:35] to my boo um this year makes 25 years
[1:29:40] um she stuck with me through the thick
[1:29:44] and the thin
[1:29:45] y'all know i used to go by grandma house
[1:29:48] you know
[1:29:48] over on center street y'all might not
[1:29:50] know nothing about that but um
[1:29:51] they used to make this kool-aid and and
[1:29:54] and the kool-aid
[1:29:55] would be it would look like grape
[1:29:57] kool-aid but when you taste it you not
[1:29:59] only taste great but you taste lemonade
[1:30:02] in the kool-aid too y'all don't know
[1:30:03] nothing about that now
[1:30:05] so so so what my wife is like
[1:30:08] that kool-aid she can be sweet
[1:30:12] but she can be taught when she needs to
[1:30:15] so i thank god for putting her in my
[1:30:17] life i thank god for that
[1:30:19] now now now there have been some
[1:30:21] blessings that have been bestowed upon
[1:30:24] we simmons children and and i want to
[1:30:26] run through some of them real
[1:30:28] quick um as you all know david is the
[1:30:31] baby boy of the crew um and and david
[1:30:35] god
[1:30:35] blessed him with the ability
[1:30:38] to use his vocal cords
[1:30:42] now if y'all have never heard my brother
[1:30:44] saying when we get done
[1:30:46] if you didn't go to church and you
[1:30:47] didn't get happy just now with my
[1:30:50] niece you gonna show enough get happy
[1:30:52] with him
[1:30:53] so so god blessed him with that
[1:30:56] um my my sister um
[1:30:59] he blessed her to be um
[1:31:03] a can cutter not not
[1:31:06] now i don't i don't know if y'all know
[1:31:08] what a can cutter is i
[1:31:10] i used to be a can cutter myself but but
[1:31:14] she is a can-cutter and my
[1:31:16] brother-in-law he knows this
[1:31:18] see see my sister don't mind
[1:31:22] cutting cans whether you are jamaican
[1:31:27] mexican african
[1:31:30] or american she will cut you with her
[1:31:33] tongue
[1:31:34] if need be hello somebody and then
[1:31:37] we have our sister who is in the
[1:31:40] hospital right now
[1:31:41] um in an extended stage jocelyn jocelyn
[1:31:45] was blessed
[1:31:45] let me tell y'all something i can
[1:31:47] remember my senior year in high school
[1:31:49] and i needed this one last math class
[1:31:52] here it is my sister's in the ninth
[1:31:53] grade tutoring me all year long
[1:31:57] for me to pass my math class and she's
[1:32:00] in the ninth grade
[1:32:01] so the analytical side went to her
[1:32:04] so there's only really one trait that i
[1:32:08] took
[1:32:09] from my parents y'all can you guess what
[1:32:12] it is
[1:32:17] hello somebody you recognized it
[1:32:20] if if someone had to take on all the
[1:32:23] looks and the debonair that my father
[1:32:25] would have
[1:32:26] i'm gonna go ahead and take that mantle
[1:32:28] and run
[1:32:30] because god blessed me and and i know my
[1:32:32] wife is
[1:32:33] appreciative of that fact she may not
[1:32:36] say it every night and then but i go and
[1:32:38] look in the mirror myself and say
[1:32:40] you some good-looking young man
[1:32:44] so i thank god for what he has bestowed
[1:32:46] me with
[1:32:48] so now that we got you laughing and we
[1:32:49] got you feeling a little looser
[1:32:51] we we're going to begin with what god
[1:32:53] has given us today
[1:32:56] and and god wanted me to to say this
[1:32:59] first
[1:32:59] there was a story once told about a
[1:33:02] young boy and he would watch this
[1:33:04] elderly woman
[1:33:05] this grandmother she would always walk
[1:33:09] through the graveyard and he would
[1:33:12] always see her
[1:33:13] every day walking through the graveyard
[1:33:17] so one day he decided he was going to go
[1:33:19] ask the grandmother that was walking
[1:33:21] through the grave rod
[1:33:23] why do you walk through the graveyard
[1:33:27] and she just simply smiled at the little
[1:33:29] boy and she said i walked through the
[1:33:31] graveyard because that's my way to get
[1:33:33] home
[1:33:35] our father has already walked through
[1:33:38] his graveyard he's home now y'all
[1:33:42] so this here message that i'm gonna give
[1:33:44] today is not
[1:33:45] about my father it's not for
[1:33:50] my father but it's for those who are
[1:33:52] still alive and remain
[1:33:54] because somebody in here might not have
[1:33:55] given themselves to christ
[1:33:57] and this is our opportunity to beckon
[1:34:00] you to come to him
[1:34:03] the man the myth and the legend
[1:34:08] before i get started on that the last
[1:34:10] time
[1:34:11] my dad invited me to a program it was
[1:34:13] one that you combat veterans had over in
[1:34:17] and something and my dad said i want you
[1:34:19] and your wife to come to

[1:34:26] something and i said okay dad i got you

[1:34:32] little suits you know

[1:34:39] something like that where they had a
[1:34:41] little 39

[1:35:22] so bad
[1:35:24] the man the mr legend the man i knew
[1:35:27] ever since
[1:35:28] i have a memory i remember this
[1:35:31] great man from carrying me on his back
[1:35:36] while he walked to school at night
[1:35:40] to him warning us about a butt
[1:35:43] cutting that we were about to get for my
[1:35:45] mother
[1:35:47] to the conversations about church
[1:35:50] and churchy people y'all don't know
[1:35:54] nothing about churchy people but
[1:35:55] but he would talk to me in an extended
[1:35:58] manner
[1:35:59] about that always giving advice in a
[1:36:01] soft
[1:36:02] manner always giving almost
[1:36:06] to a fault i can remember us kids
[1:36:09] sitting at the table
[1:36:11] now if i'm talking over your head please
[1:36:13] please please just bear with me
[1:36:15] sitting at the table eating turkey necks
[1:36:17] y'all y'all don't know nothing about
[1:36:19] turkey neck see
[1:36:21] see mama had done something i don't know
[1:36:23] what she did to them turkey necks but
[1:36:25] she would have you sitting there sucking
[1:36:27] on the bones
[1:36:29] of the turkey necks even to the point
[1:36:31] where she would have
[1:36:32] y'all know how you have tomatoes with
[1:36:34] some fat back in it and
[1:36:36] and you take the tomatoes and the fat
[1:36:38] back and you put it over some rice
[1:36:39] and that became a meal i know y'all
[1:36:41] don't know nothing about that even to
[1:36:43] the point
[1:36:44] where we used to get this what we call
[1:36:45] round steak
[1:36:47] that would be diced up and put entire
[1:36:49] inside some beans and
[1:36:51] put over some rice y'all might call it
[1:36:54] beanie weenies
[1:36:55] but we loved it and if you invite me
[1:36:58] today to come eat some beanie wings if
[1:36:59] you can fix it like my mama i promise
[1:37:01] you i'll be right there with you
[1:37:04] but to talk about my dad as the myth
[1:37:06] pbs.org says this is what a myth is
[1:37:09] it's a story that is based on tradition
[1:37:12] some say having factual origin while
[1:37:15] others are
[1:37:16] fictional but myths are more than mere
[1:37:19] stories
[1:37:20] they serve as a more profound purpose in
[1:37:23] ancient and modern culture culture
[1:37:26] myths are sacred tales that explain the
[1:37:29] world
[1:37:30] of man's experience then when we deal
[1:37:33] with legend
[1:37:34] according to webster webster says in
[1:37:36] webster dictionary
[1:37:37] it is a story coming down from
[1:37:41] the past so what i want to talk about
[1:37:45] today
[1:37:46] is dealing with something that that my
[1:37:48] dad really
[1:37:50] helped me with in understanding
[1:37:53] how to deal with life
[1:37:58] and in the end when it's all said and
[1:38:01] done
[1:38:02] everything is going to be all right
[1:38:06] luke 13. i'm coming from luke the 13th
[1:38:10] chapter
[1:38:13] starting at verse number 6 and i'm gonna
[1:38:15] read them to verse number nine
[1:38:18] if you have it say amen if you look and
[1:38:22] stay still looking
[1:38:24] and if you still looking you might as
[1:38:25] well go ahead and listen to me
[1:38:27] and it reads as follows and i'm reading
[1:38:30] from the niv it says then he told a
[1:38:32] parable
[1:38:33] a man had a fig tree growing in a
[1:38:36] vineyard and he went to look for fruit
[1:38:39] on it but did not find any
[1:38:42] so he said to the man who took care of
[1:38:45] the vineyard
[1:38:46] for three years now i've been coming to
[1:38:49] look for fruit
[1:38:50] on this fig tree and haven't found any
[1:38:53] cut it down why should it use up the
[1:38:57] soil
[1:38:58] sir the man replied leave it alone for
[1:39:02] one more year and i'll dig around it and
[1:39:05] fertilize it
[1:39:07] if it bears fruit next year fine
[1:39:10] if not cut it down
[1:39:13] god's word for god's people
[1:39:17] and today i want to talk to you about
[1:39:19] the good gardener
[1:39:20] the good gardener
[1:39:24] in these particular verses that we're
[1:39:26] reading god
[1:39:27] is jesus is telling us a parable y'all
[1:39:30] and a parable is a story
[1:39:32] because he wants you to understand
[1:39:35] kingdom
[1:39:36] wording but in a natural setting that
[1:39:39] you can understand
[1:39:41] so so he's talking about a garden that
[1:39:44] he has
[1:39:45] now a vineyard is normally a yard that
[1:39:48] has
[1:39:49] all these grape vines all over it and
[1:39:52] the grapevines are producing grapes
[1:39:54] but in this particular vineyard there
[1:39:57] was a
[1:39:58] fig tree in the vineyard
[1:40:01] and i don't know why my mind got
[1:40:03] inquisitive about the
[1:40:04] the fig tree and i started doing
[1:40:06] research on
[1:40:07] the fig tree and i wanted to know more
[1:40:09] about a fig tree
[1:40:11] why was he so upset that the fig tree
[1:40:14] was not
[1:40:15] producing fruit why would god be so
[1:40:17] upset with us
[1:40:19] if we don't produce fruit so so i begin
[1:40:22] to look up
[1:40:23] the fig tree and i realize that a fig
[1:40:26] tree is not like a regular fruit tree
[1:40:28] y'all
[1:40:30] see regular fruit trees only produce in
[1:40:33] particular
[1:40:34] seasons whereas a fig tree can produce
[1:40:38] all year long
[1:40:41] but most fig trees require something a
[1:40:44] little different
[1:40:45] see most of our plants on earth
[1:40:48] they require pollination and that
[1:40:50] normally comes from
[1:40:52] a bee y'all but the fig tree has
[1:40:55] another helper and and i hope i'm like
[1:40:58] that helper today
[1:41:00] he has something called a fig wasp
[1:41:03] see a fig wasp goes and lays their eggs
[1:41:07] on the fig tree which causes the fig
[1:41:10] tree to awaken
[1:41:11] and produce fruit and the walls
[1:41:14] when they're small eat the fruit that's
[1:41:17] on the fig
[1:41:18] tree so the fig tree
[1:41:22] because it has this wasp
[1:41:26] can do things a little differently now
[1:41:29] watch this
[1:41:30] you can find fig trees on the top of
[1:41:32] mountains
[1:41:34] you can find fig trees in the middle of
[1:41:36] the desert
[1:41:38] because this particular waltz will go
[1:41:42] ten times farther to look for a fig tree
[1:41:46] then a bee would look for anything to
[1:41:48] pollinate
[1:41:50] so for this fig tree to go three years
[1:41:53] without making any fruit
[1:41:57] because i know that it can bear fruit
[1:42:00] all year long not just in the summer not
[1:42:03] just in the winter
[1:42:04] not just in the spring not just in the
[1:42:07] fall but it can produce fruit
[1:42:09] all year long something is going on
[1:42:13] see god is going to look at your life
[1:42:15] one day and he's going to ask you
[1:42:17] why is it that you are not producing
[1:42:21] fruit if you are not doing what god says
[1:42:24] do
[1:42:25] if you are not giving like god said give
[1:42:28] if you are not doing the things that
[1:42:30] will make you
[1:42:32] enter into heaven god said i don't see
[1:42:36] the fruit but but i i began to listen to
[1:42:39] what the gardener had to say now the
[1:42:42] gardener is christ he said hold on
[1:42:44] give me a little bit of time because i
[1:42:46] need to deal with
[1:42:47] with this particular fig tree i need to
[1:42:50] do something for this fig tree
[1:42:52] see i need to put something around the
[1:42:54] fig tree and see if i can
[1:42:56] cultivate it a little bit more to make
[1:42:59] it do what it needs to do
[1:43:01] see what he had to put around it was
[1:43:03] some fertilizer y'all
[1:43:05] y'all know there's some different names
[1:43:06] and some colorful names that we call
[1:43:08] fertilizer y'all know that right
[1:43:11] well i'm just gonna call it mess can i
[1:43:13] deal with that can i just call it mess
[1:43:15] y'all
[1:43:16] so so he began to put some mess
[1:43:19] around the fig tree in order to see
[1:43:22] if the fig tree was going to develop
[1:43:25] listen
[1:43:25] sometimes all of us have some mess in
[1:43:28] our lives
[1:43:29] that is put around us but god wants to
[1:43:32] know whether or not the mess
[1:43:33] that is put around you is going to cause
[1:43:35] you to grow or cause you to die
[1:43:41] so what we have to learn to do as a
[1:43:43] family y'all
[1:43:44] as a people y'all as friends y'all we've
[1:43:47] got to learn to deal
[1:43:48] with our mess because as long as
[1:43:52] god is on the throne he takes mess and
[1:43:55] make it turn from mess
[1:43:56] to something that is beautiful so you
[1:43:59] can grow from your mess
[1:44:01] but see you've got to understand and
[1:44:03] know that in order for you to grow
[1:44:05] you've got to have god in your life you
[1:44:08] can
[1:44:08] try hard as you might but it won't work
[1:44:11] unless you let god
[1:44:13] deliver you from your mess
[1:44:16] you're going to continue to not produce
[1:44:19] fruit
[1:44:20] if you don't let god enter your life but
[1:44:23] if you allow
[1:44:23] god to come into your life if you allow
[1:44:26] him to do
[1:44:27] what it is that he can do everything is
[1:44:30] going to be
[1:44:31] all right but you got to let god in the
[1:44:34] end
[1:44:34] in order for it to be so not because you
[1:44:37] wanted to be so
[1:44:38] but because god said so so
[1:44:42] know that the mess has to come
[1:44:45] come on we got some messy situations
[1:44:47] that go on in our lives y'all
[1:44:49] we got some messy situations that we
[1:44:51] hide in our closets
[1:44:53] we got some messy situations that
[1:44:55] everybody knows about
[1:44:56] but i'm here to tell you if you learn to
[1:44:58] deal with your mess
[1:45:01] you will get the fruit that you need
[1:45:04] but how can you produce fruit if you're
[1:45:07] not allowing god to enter in
[1:45:10] god has to come in god has to show
[1:45:13] himself in your life
[1:45:15] you have to allow him to do so but if
[1:45:17] you don't allow god to enter in
[1:45:20] god is gonna one day cut you down
[1:45:23] see my father was a cultivator he knew
[1:45:26] how to take your mess and work with you
[1:45:29] he knew how to take that mess and say
[1:45:31] listen you can do better
[1:45:33] you can work for yourself you can make
[1:45:35] it you just gotta try a little bit
[1:45:37] harder
[1:45:38] you just gotta do this or you might
[1:45:40] wanna do that but the word says this
[1:45:42] the word says that you see you get tired
[1:45:44] sometimes from hearing what he say about
[1:45:46] what the words say but i'm here to tell
[1:45:48] you if you listen to what the word says
[1:45:51] it's gonna be all right
[1:45:54] but learn to listen to what god has to
[1:45:57] say not
[1:45:58] man but listen to god because in the end
[1:46:03] in the end it's going to be
[1:46:07] in the end it's going to be in the end
[1:46:11] it's going
[1:46:12] to be but you've got to learn
[1:46:15] to turn it over to him
[1:46:18] see i can't get you in heaven i can't
[1:46:22] get you in heaven
[1:46:24] it is what you do it is the fruit of
[1:46:27] your labor what is it that you are doing
[1:46:30] what are you producing
[1:46:31] is it good fruit is it good fruit
[1:46:37] is it edible for god listen
[1:46:40] some of us produce fruit but we know
[1:46:42] what kind of fruit we producing
[1:46:45] it ain't the kind of fruit that's
[1:46:46] pleasing in god's sight
[1:46:49] god say listen only the just will
[1:46:52] scarcely
[1:46:53] make it in so you don't need to tempt
[1:46:56] god
[1:46:57] by not producing good fruit you have an
[1:47:01] opportunity right here right now to say
[1:47:03] i've got to change something within me
[1:47:06] i can't worry about everybody else
[1:47:07] because listen just like my dad had to
[1:47:09] answer for himself
[1:47:10] you too will have to answer for yourself
[1:47:12] one day
[1:47:14] and when you answer for yourself you
[1:47:16] want him to say well done
[1:47:18] my good and faithful servant
[1:47:21] enter ye into the house of the lord
[1:47:25] it hurts sometimes it hurts right now
[1:47:28] for me
[1:47:29] it hurts for my family but you know what
[1:47:32] i know that when it's all said and done
[1:47:36] it's gonna be
[1:47:40] friends it's gonna be
[1:47:43] family it's gonna be
[1:47:46] brother and sister here it's gonna be
[1:47:50] no family that it's gonna be
[1:47:54] but we gotta put it in god's hand deal
[1:47:57] with the mess knowing that god would
[1:48:01] take your mess and turn it into
[1:48:02] something beautiful
[1:48:04] you might be dealing in mess right now
[1:48:06] but it's going to turn out
[1:48:07] the way god wants it to god's word
[1:48:10] for god's people amen

[1:59:13] it's the people of faith that makes a
[1:59:14] difference
[1:59:16] it was by faith they made it thus far

[1:59:19] it on
[1:59:20] so don't allow your prayers just to stop
[1:59:22] here
[1:59:24] but continue to pray for them as they

[2:00:08] that it gets easy
